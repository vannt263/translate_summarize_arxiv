    "<S> plya pointed out if the number equals one , then the walk is called recurrent , otherwise the walk is transient because the walker has a nonzero probability to escape  @xcite . as a consequence , plya showed that for one and two dimensional infinite lattices the walks are recurrent , while for three dimension or higher dimensions the walks are transient and a unique plya number is calculated for them  @xcite . recently , </S>",
    "<S> m. tefak _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ extend the concept of plya number to characterize the recurrence properties of quantum walks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they point out that the recurrence behavior of quantum walks is not solely determined by the dimensionality of the structure , but also depend on the topology of the walk , choice of coin operators , and the initial coin state , etc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the plya number of random walks or quantum walks may depends on a variety of ingredients including the structural dimensionality and model parameters .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider recurrence properties for a general one - dimensional random walk . </S>",
    "<S> the walk starts at @xmath8 on a line and at each time step the walker moves one unit towards the left or right with probabilities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , or remain at the same position with probability @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this general random walk model has some useful application in physical or chemical problems , and some of its dynamical properties requires a further study . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of one - dimensional random walk focus on the simple symmetric case where the walker moves to left and right with equal probability ( @xmath9 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , plya showed that the symmetric random walk is recurrent and its plya number equals to 1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , recurrence properties of this general random walk defined here are still unknown . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , we will calculate the plya number for this general random model and discuss its recurrence properties . </S>",
    "<S> we will try to derive an explicit expression for plya number , and reveal its dependence on the model parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> plya number of random walks can be expressed in terms of the return probability @xmath10  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , the probability for the walker returns to its original position @xmath8 at step @xmath11 , @xmath12 hence , the recurrence behavior of random walk is determined solely by the infinite summation of return probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that if the summation of return probabilities diverges the walk is recurrent ( @xmath13 ) , and if the summation converges the walk is transient ( @xmath14 ) . to calculate the plya number , it is crucial to obtain the return probabilities . in the following , we will calculate the return probabilities for our general random walk model .    </S>",
    "<S> the return probability @xmath10 can be obtained using the trinomial coefficients of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> considering an ensemble of random walks after @xmath11 steps , in which the walker has @xmath16 steps moving left , @xmath17 steps moving right and @xmath18 steps remaining at the same position , then the probability for such random walks is @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . since the walker s position @xmath22 is only dependant on the difference of right - moving steps @xmath17 and left - moving steps @xmath16 , @xmath23 , returning to the original position @xmath8 requires @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ensemble of random walks returning to @xmath8 involves sum over all possible @xmath18 subject to the constraints @xmath24 and @xmath25 . because @xmath26 is an even number , @xmath11 and @xmath18 must have the same parity . here , we suppose @xmath27 , @xmath28 for even @xmath11 and @xmath18 , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 for odd @xmath11 and @xmath18 ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 are nonnegative integers , and @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the return probability for even @xmath11 and odd @xmath11 separately . for even @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> the return probability is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath35 are used in the above equation . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , for odd @xmath11 , the return probability is given by , @xmath36    the infinite summation of return probabilities @xmath37 can be determined by the sum of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40    in order to get a simple expression for @xmath37 , we define @xmath41 , thus @xmath42 . substituting this relation into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq4 ] ) , we get @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the gauss hypergeometric function . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 can be further simplified , for the sake of clarity , we first consider the case @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath45 the hypergeometric function equals to 1 , @xmath37 can be simplified as , @xmath46 the last equality follows from the taylor series expansion at @xmath47 for the function @xmath48 .    for @xmath49 , we find that @xmath37 also equals to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is surprising because @xmath37 does not depend on the remaining unmoving probability @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , for all @xmath2 and @xmath6 , eq .  ( [ eq5 ] ) can be simplified as , @xmath51    it is difficult to simplify eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq5 ] ) or prove eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq7 ] ) using the usual mathematical methods . here , </S>",
    "<S> in the appendix , we prove this rigorous expression ( [ eq7 ] ) by the method of creative telescoping . </S>",
    "<S> the method of creative telescoping  @xcite is an algorithm to compute hypergeometric summation , definite integration , and prove combinatorial identity . using this method , we transfer @xmath37 to the solution of a partial differential equation ( see the proof in the appendix ) .    the plya number in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) can be written as , @xmath52 consequently , we find a simple explicit expression for plya number , which is solely determined by the absolute difference of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath7 .    according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq8 ] ) , plya number @xmath4 equals to 1 for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the walk is recurrent if and only if the left - moving probability @xmath0 equals to the right - moving probability @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our result is consistent with previous conclusion that one - dimensional symmetric random walk ( @xmath9 ) is recurrent . </S>",
    "<S> our result also indicates that the infinite summation of return probabilities @xmath37 diverges for @xmath53 and converges for @xmath54 . to verify this point , we plot the return probability @xmath10 as a function of step @xmath11 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath10 is a power - law decay as @xmath55 for @xmath53 ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fg1 ] ( b ) , ( c ) in the log - linear plot ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath10 for @xmath53 decays slower than @xmath56 and decays faster than @xmath56 for @xmath54 , the infinite summation @xmath37 diverges for @xmath53 and converges otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , by means of stirling s approximation @xmath57 for @xmath45 , we find an asymptotic form for the return probability in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> for a certain value of @xmath60 , the decay behavior of @xmath10 seems different for different values of @xmath2 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg1 ] ( b ) , ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the summations of @xmath10 for different @xmath2 are identical and equal to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is some what unexpected and we provide a strict proof in the appendix .    [ 0.25 ] as a function of step @xmath11 for @xmath53 ( a ) , @xmath61 ( b ) and @xmath62 ( c ) . for each value of @xmath6 , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath10 shows a power - law decay @xmath66 for @xmath53 ( see ( a ) ) , and @xmath10 exhibits exponential decay for @xmath60 ( see ( b ) and ( c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that for the case @xmath49 , @xmath10 is nonzero at all values of @xmath11 , while @xmath10 is zero at odd @xmath11 for @xmath45 . </S>",
