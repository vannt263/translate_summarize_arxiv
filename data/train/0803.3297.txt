    "optical lattices ( ols ) offer a powerful and ubiquitous tool for the creation and control of various patterns in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "ols are induced by the interference of counterpropagating coherent laser beams illuminating the condensate and creating an effective periodic potential for atoms @xcite .",
    "a well - established fact is that ols support _ gap solitons _ in becs with repulsive interactions between atoms .",
    "effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) gap solitons were predicted @xcite and then created experimentally in becs filling a  cigar - shaped \" trap , which acted in the combination with an ol induced in the axial direction . in self - attractive media ,",
    "periodic potentials allow one to capture a soliton at a prescribed position , and also give rise to stable multi - soliton complexes .",
    "in fact , the model of a medium with the cubic self - attractive nonlinearity and effective periodic potential applies not only to bec but also to optics , where it predicts spatial solitons in a planar waveguide with a transverse modulation of the local refractive index .",
    "actually , the model was first put forward in the latter context , and fundamental solitons , as well as their bound states , were found in it @xcite .",
    "later , the same model was introduced in the context of the mean - field dynamics in becs @xcite .",
    "another topic of great interest to becs is the study of binary condensates , which are most typically generated as mixtures of two different hyperfine atomic states , with opposite values of the @xmath0-projection of the atomic spin @xcite .",
    "the interactions between atoms belonging to the same feshbach and different @xcite hyperfine species can be controlled ( including a possibility to reverse the sign of the interaction ) by means of the feshbach resonance .",
    "in particular , one may consider a binary condensate that features intra - species repulsive interactions combined with attraction between the species .",
    "it was predicted that the latter setting may give rise to _ symbiotic _ soliton complexes @xcite , which are held together by the attraction overcoming the intrinsic repulsion .",
    "specific types of bec solitons have also been predicted in settings assuming a binary condensate trapped in ols . in particular , the interplay of the repulsion between the two species , if combined with the dynamical effect induced by the lattice ( an effective negative mass of collective excitations ) may give rise to 1d and 2d _ symbiotic gap solitons _ gap - symbio , gap - symbio2 , even in the case when the intra - species interaction is switched off .",
    "the addition of the intra - species repulsion helps to expand the stability region of the symbiotic gap solitons gap - symbio , while the interplay of the ol effects , intra - species attraction , and repulsion between the two species gives rise to other new types of solitons complexes , such as _ semi - gap _ ones , with one of the components belonging to the semi - infinite gap in the ol - induced linear spectrum , while the other component sits in a finite bandgap gap - symbio2 .",
    "the case of the attraction between two self - repulsive species was recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was demonstrated that the attraction leads to a counter - intuitive result , _",
    "viz_. , _ splitting _ between gap solitons formed in each species .",
    "this effect is explained by a  negative effective mass of gap solitons , which is one of their principal characteristic features @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ol potentials acting on two species in a binary bec need not be identical .",
    "for example , if the actual source of the potential is not an ol , but rather a periodically nonuniform distribution of a magnetic field ( acting in direction @xmath0 and modulated along @xmath1 ) , which couples to the atomic spin ( while the basic trap is optical ) , then the effective potential will , obviously , have opposite signs for the atomic states with opposite values of the @xmath0-component of the spin .",
    "an issue of straightforward interest is then to consider two - component soliton complexes supported by pairs of _ mismatched lattices_. in particular , effects of the mismatch on two - component 1d and 2d gap solitons with _ linear _ coupling between the components ( which corresponds to bec loaded into two parallel tunnel - coupled traps ) were studied in refs .",
    "it was found that the mismatch affects the _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ ( ssb ) bifurcation that accounts for a transition from symmetric or antisymmetric solitons to asymmetric ones : the symmetric / antisymmetric states are replaced by their _",
    "quasi_-symmetric / antisymmetric counterparts , but the bifurcation still occurs .",
    "an exception is the limit case when the phase shift between the lattices is @xmath2 ( i.e. , the two ol potentials are mutually opposite )  then , the bifurcation is replaced by a _",
    "pseudo - bifurcation _ , in which branches of quasi - symmetric / antisymmetric and asymmetric solutions asymptotically approach each other , but never meet arik .",
    "effects of the mismatch between two gratings on the ssb bifurcations of optical gap solitons were also studied in the model of two linearly coupled parallel fiber bragg gratings , which is an optical counterpart of the ol pair in the bec model @xcite (  light bullets \" in an array of bragg gratings with alternating signs were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the objective of the present work is to study 1d two - component solitons with the ordinary nonlinear _ attraction _ between the species , assuming that they are subject to the action of periodic potentials _ with opposite signs_. the model corresponds , in particular , to the above - mentioned mixture of two atomic states with opposite values of the spin , that couples to a periodically modulated distribution of the magnetic field .",
    "issues of straightforward interest are the existence and stability of two - component solitons .",
    "the stability problem is quite nontrivial in this setting , as , on the one hand , the soliton complex tends to be unstable because one of its constituent components is placed around a local maximum of the respective potential , but , on the other hand , the complex may be stabilized by the attraction between the components .",
    "we consider two varieties of the model , with either intrinsic attraction in both components [ the respective soliton complexes are categorized as _ bright - bright _ ( bb ) ones ] , or opposite signs of the intra - species interaction [ which corresponds to _ gap - bright _ ( gb ) complexes ] .",
    "it is necessary to mention that various solutions ( chiefly of the solitary wave type ) in models of two - component bec mixtures trapped in ols , with attractive inter- and intra - species interactions , were considered in several works misc , ok . in most cases ,",
    "the periodic potentials acting on both species were essentially identical ( in - phase ) @xcite , although an example with the phase shift of @xmath3 between the two potentials was considered too @xcite ( the latter work was chiefly dealing with soliton complexes of the dark - bright type ) .",
    "however , the settings studied in the present work were not considered before , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we formulate the model in sec .",
    "ii , and summarize results for both types of the soliton complexes , of the bb and gb types , in sec .",
    "stability regions in a relevant parameter space are identified through the numerical computation of eigenvalues for small perturbations .",
    "the evolution of unstable solitons is explored by means of systematic direct simulations .",
    "the paper is concluded by sec . iv .",
    "the starting point is the system of coupled 1d gross - pitaevskii equations for the mean - field wave functions of the two bec species , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite . in the usual scaled form , the system is@xmath6with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are effective interaction coefficients ( @xmath9 are scattering lengths of the respective interatomic interactions , @xmath10 the atomic mass , common for both species , and @xmath11 the transverse trapping frequency ) , and @xmath12 are the normalized ol potentials , which are different for the two components . in accordance with the scaling ,",

    "( [ eqn1 ] ) and linearization . sets of unstable complex eigenvalues of the resulting hamiltonian eigenvalue problem arise in quartets , i.e. , if @xmath24 is an eigenvalue , then so are @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , hence the existence of any @xmath28 implies instability ( real eigenvalues come in pairs , @xmath29 , which also gives rise to instability ) .",
    "the eigenvalue problem was solved by using a finite - difference discretization [ in the same way as it was used to solve the stationary version of eq .",
    "( eqn1 ) ] .",
    "the latter method reduces the problem to finding matrix eigenvalues , which can be done by means of standard numerical linear algebra packages .",
    "if a configuration is found to be unstable , an outcome of the instability development was concluded from direct simulations . to that effect",

    "the intrinsic nonlinearity in one species was self - attractive , while in the other one it might have either sign ; however , the inter - species interaction was always attractive .",
    "due to the opposite signs of the two effective ol potentials , the bound state of two solitons could be unstable , as the second component of this state had to be centered around a local potential maximum . in both cases when the nonlinearity in the stable component ( the one centered around the respective potential minimum ) is self - attractive or self - repulsive ( while the other species is self - attractive ) , we have identified stability regions for the soliton complexes , varying the strength of the inter - species attraction and of the ol depth . in cases when the soliton complex is unstable , direct simulations have made it possible to identify basic scenarios of the instability development , which amount to the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) and resulting oscillations of one or both components . in the case of the soliton complex of the  gap - bright \" ( gb ) type ,",
    "the unstable (  bright \" ) component may also potentially split into two unequal parts , which oscillate around different local potential minima .",
    "it is relevant to mention that it was not possible to implement a different type of the instability , where the gap - type component ( the intrinsically self - repulsive one ) would be originally set in an unstable position with respect to its sublattice , as a complex of such a type could _ never _ be constructed ( even as a formal solution ) . for the same reason , we did not consider complexes of the gap - gap type .    as concerns possible extensions of this work , an interesting issue is to consider the stability and dynamics of two - component solitons in two dimensions , that would be supported by two square lattices with the phase shift of @xmath2 in both directions @xmath1 and @xmath89 . in that case , it would be interesting to examine whether the unstable component may perform two - dimensional quasi - circular motion around the pinned stable one .",
