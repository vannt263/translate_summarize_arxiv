    "recent years have seen a surge in interest in studies of accreting neutron stars and black holes .",
    "one reason is that these objects provide a very unique window to a deeper understanding of the physics of strong gravity and dense matter .",
    "the complicated structure of these stellar objects , including strong gravity , gravitationally - captured plasma accretion , rapid rotation , bursting in accreted materials , thermal x - ray emission , and several other features makes a most fascinating object for both theoretical and observational investigations .",
    "one of the most interesting features of these objects is the interaction of accreting plasma with the stellar magnetic field .",
    "matter is transferred from a normal donor star to the compact object .",
    "mhd models of the infalling plasma and the neutron star magnetosphere allow a relatively simple first approach to an understanding of plasma flow and the configuration of the magnetosphere around a neutron star .",
    "research on plasma accretion by magnetic neutron stars began in the early 1970s with the discovery of periodic oscillations in x - ray fluxes of the stars cen x-3 @xcite and her x-1 @xcite .",
    "interest in these systems rose about two decades ago , after the first observation of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the persistent x - ray fluxes of the luminous x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "these oscillations are detected both in low and high frequencies with frequencies ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 hz and from @xmath7 to @xmath1 hz , respectively .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) has observed persistent x - ray emissions about 20 accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "generally , three different millisecond phenomena have now been observed in x - ray binaries : the twin kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) , the burst oscillations , and the spin frequency of the accreting , low - magnetic field , neutron star .",
    "these kilohertz frequencies are the highest frequency oscillations ever seen in any astrophysical object , and are now widely interpreted as due to orbital motion in the inner accretion flow .",
    "the oscillations sometimes have one spectral peak . in most sources",
    ", however , the x - ray spectrum shows two simultaneous khz peaks with a roughly constant peak separation , moving up and down together in time as a function of photon count rate . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the hz - khz qpos .",
    "the burst oscillations with frequencies in the @xmath8 hz range have been observed in a number of the x - rays sources , usually during a type i x - ray burst due to a thermonuclear runaway in the accreted matter on the neutron star surface .",
    "furthermore , the frequency of the burst oscillation increases by @xmath9 hz during the burst tail , converging in time to a stable frequency at the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "it is believed that the burst oscillations arise due to a hot spot or spots in an atmospheric layer of the neutron star .",
    "this has been explained by a decoupling of the atmospheric layer from the star and expansion by @xmath10 m during the x - ray burst , while its angular momentum remains constant .",
    "therefore , during the burst tail , the frequency increases due to spin - up of the atmosphere as it re - contracts .",
    "the asymptotic frequency corresponds to a fully re - contracted atmosphere and is the closest to the true neutron star spin frequency ( see the recent review by @xcite ) . in a few sources , however , a rather large frequency drift , @xmath11 hz ,",
    "is observed .",
    "this drift is not consistent with the above model ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "although there are some detailed differences in different types of x - ray sources , the observed qpos in all sources are remarkably similar , both in frequency and peak separation .",
    "( six of the 20 known sources are originally identified as `` z '' sources and the rest are known as `` atoll '' sources , see table 1 . for more information about the atoll and z sources , see @xcite . )",
    "such a similarity shows that qpos should depend on general characteristics of the x - ray sources which are common to all systems . in other words ,",
    "the qpo can be regarded as a generic feature of the accreting neutron star .    in the accretion disk of accreting binaries the material from the donor star moves around the compact star in near - keplerian orbits .",
    "depending on the binary separation , the disk radius varies from @xmath12 to @xmath13 km .",
    "although there is still no certainty about the flow geometry in the inner emitting region , the extension of a part of the flow down into the emitting region in the form of a keplerian disk is the basic assumption of most proposed models for accretion of matter onto low magnetic field neutron stars ( see for example @xcite ) . due to the interaction with the magnetic field of the star , radiation drag , and relativistic effects",
    ", the flow will be terminated at a radius @xmath14 , the innermost stable orbital radius that is larger than radius of the compact star @xmath15 . within @xmath16 matter",
    "may leave the disk and so the flow is no longer keplerian .",
    "remarkably , the characteristic dynamical time scale for materials moving near the compact object is comparable with the observed millisecond x - ray variability , ie . @xmath17 .",
    "such a natural periodicity is the foundation of most models for the observed qpos .",
    "we will discuss these models in the next section .",
    "another common feature in accreting binaries is the interaction of the accretion disk with neutron star s magnetosphere . in all sources ,",
    "matters transfer from a normal donor star to the compact object .",
    "this matter is accelerated by the gravitational pull of the compact object and hits the magnetosphere of the star with a sonic / supersonic speed .",
    "the mhd interaction of the infalling plasma with the neutron star magnetosphere , will alter not only the plasma flow toward the surface of the star , as assumed by current qpo models , but also the structure of the star s magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic field of the neutron star is distorted inward by the infalling plasma of the keplerian accretion flow .",
    "since the gravity of the star confines the inward flow to a small solid angle @xmath18 ster , the magnetic field of the star will be more compressed in the disk plane than in other areas , see fig .",
    "[ star - fig1 ] .",
    "furthermore , in a more realistic picture , one would expect that the highly accelerated plasma due to the infall process would be able to penetrate through the magnetic field lines .",
    "such materials will be trapped by the magnetic field lines and produce enhanced density regions within the magnetosphere . however , due to their initial velocities , they move along the field lines , finally hit the star surface at the magnetic poles and produce the observed x - ray fluxes ( fig .",
    "[ star - fig1 ] ) .",
    "see @xcite for more detail .",
    "besides modifying the geometry of magnetosphere , the compressional action of the accretion flow can excite some perturbations in the enhanced density region .",
    "this can be understood by noting this fact that the inward motion of the accretion flow will be halted by the outward magnetic pressure at a certain distance from the star , the alfvn radius @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the accretion flow pushes the stellar magnetic field toward the star until the inward pressure of the infalling plasma @xmath19 balances with the outward magnetic pressure @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the density and radial velocity of the infalling matter and @xmath23 is the poloidal magnetic field at the disk plane .",
    "therefore , any instability in the disk at the alfvn radius would disturb such quasi - equilibrium configuration as well as the structure of magnetosphere . as an example",
    ", the interaction of the solar wind with earth magnetosphere excites resonant shear alfvn waves , or field line resonances ( flrs ) , along the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "as a result , one might expect that such alfvn waves can be excited by the compressive accreting plasma in the magnetosphere of an accreting neutron star with the accretion flow playing the role of the solar wind .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follow : in section [ sect : qpo ] we discuss some of the current models for the observed qpos .",
    "specifically , we will review the two models , the sonic - point beat frequency model and the relativistic precession model , in more detail .",
    "we outline an occurrence of the resonant coupling in a magnetized plasma in section [ sect : mag ] .",
    "specifically , we review the excitation of shear alfvn waves by studying linear perturbations in mhd . next , the occurrence of field line resonances ( flrs ) , as a result of a resonant coupling between the compressional and shear alfvn waves , is discussed .",
    "to illustrate the basic features of flrs , the excitation of these resonances in a rectilinear magnetic field and in a dipolar field are considered .",
    "a dipolar topology is likely appropriate for the magnetosphere of a neutron star , near the surface .",
    "depending on the field line where the resonance occurs the eigenfrequency of the flr is in range of several hundred hz to khz . in section [ amb ] , in order to consider a more realistic model for an accreting neutron star , we study an influence of the ambient flow along the field line on the excitation of flrs .",
    "we demonstrate that in this case the eigenfrequency of the alfvn modes is modulated by the velocity of the plasma flow .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of the field aligned flow , the plasma displacement parallel to the magnetic field lines is non - zero .",
    "these displacements , which are missing in case of zero ambient flow , might be responsible for modulating the motion of infalling materials toward the magnetic poles and producing the observed x - ray fluxes . a possible occurrence of more than one peak in the power spectrum is also discussed .",
    "in addition , we show that the observed @xmath4 frequency ratio of qpos is a natural result of our model .",
    "section [ conc ] is devoted to summarizing our results and further discussions .",
    "although the behavior of observed qpos in the x - ray spectrum of accreting neutron stars in lmxbs are somewhat similar , a wide variety of models have been proposed for qpos .",
    "most , but not all of these models , involve orbital motion around the neutron star .",
    "these models include the beat - frequency models , the relativistic precession model , and the disk mode models .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present work to discuss all these models .",
    "we point out , however , some of the main issues of the most prominent models .",
    "further information can be found in a review by @xcite .      as discussed earlier , beat - frequency models are based on the orbital motion of the matter at some preferred radius in the disk .",
    "@xcite firstly proposed a beat - frequency model to explain the low - frequencyhz ) qpos were known in the z sources , the @xmath24hz so - called normal and flaring - branch oscillation ( nbo ; @xcite ) and the @xmath25hz so - called horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) seen in z sources ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they used the alvn radius @xmath26 as the preferred radius we have @xmath27 . ] . here",
    "@xmath28 is the mass of accretion rate in units of @xmath29 g s@xmath30 and @xmath31 is the stellar magnetic field in units of @xmath32 g @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite proposed a beat - frequency model , the so - called the sonic - point beat - frequency model , based on a new preferred radius , the sonic radius . in this model",
    ", they assumed that near the neutron star there is a very narrow region of the disk in which the radial inflow velocity increases rapidly as radius decreases .",
    "such a sharp transition in the radial velocity of plasma flow from subsonic to supersonic happens at the `` sonic point '' radius , @xmath34 .",
    "this radius tends to be near to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , .",
    "the frequency of orbital motion at the isco , the highest possible stable orbital frequency , is @xmath35 . ]",
    "@xmath36 , however , radiative stresses may change its location , as required by the observation that the khz qpo frequencies vary . comparing the hbo and khz qpo frequencies ,",
    "clearly @xmath37 , so part of the accreting matter must remain in near - keplerian orbits well within @xmath38 .    in order to explain how such orbital frequencies can modulate the x - ray fluxes , they assumed that in the accreting gas some local density inhomogeneities `` clumps '' are created by magneto - turbulence , differential cooling of matters , and radiation drags . at @xmath34",
    "these orbiting clumps gradually accrete onto the neutron star , following a fixed spiral - shaped trajectory in the frame corotating with their orbital motion and hit the star surface before they are completely sheared or dissipated by radiation drag . at the `` footpoint '' of a clump s spiral",
    "flow the matter hits the surface of the star and so the emission is enhanced .",
    "the clump s footpoint travels around the neutron star at the clump s orbital angular velocity , so a distant observer whose line of sight is inclined with respect to the disk axis sees a hot spot that is periodically occulted by the star with the keplerian frequency at @xmath34 .",
    "this produces the upper khz peak at @xmath39 .",
    "the high coherency of the qpo implies that all clumps are near one precise radius and live for several @xmath40 to @xmath41 s , and allows for relatively little fluctuations in the spiral flow . to explain twin peaks",
    ", it is also assumed that some of the accreting plasma is channelled by the magnetic field onto the magnetic poles that rotate with the star .",
    "the beat frequency at @xmath42 occurs because a beam of x - rays generated by accretion onto the magnetic poles sweeps around at the neutron star spin frequency @xmath43 and hence irradiates the clumps at @xmath34 once per beat period , which modulates , at the beat frequency , the rate at which the clumps provide matter to their spiral flows and consequently the emission from the footpoints .",
    "an important prediction of the sonic - point model is that @xmath44 be constant at @xmath43 , which is contrary to observations @xcite .",
    "however , one obtains better consistency with observations by assuming that the orbits of clumps are gradually spiraling down . as a result",
    ", the observed beat frequency will be higher than the actual beat frequency at which beam and clumps interact .",
    "this can be understood by noting that during the clump s lifetime the inflow time of matter from clump to surface gradually diminishes .",
    "therefore , the lower khz peak gets closer to the upper one , and so @xmath45 decreases @xcite .",
    "such a decrease is enhanced at higher x - ray luminosity @xmath46 because of a stronger radiation drag causes a faster spiraling - down , as observed @xcite .",
    "due to complications , it is hard to predict how exactly this affects the relation between frequencies which makes testing the model more difficult .",
    "based on general relativity , it is well known that the motion of a free - particle in an inclined eccentric orbit around a spinning object experiences both relativistic periastron precession similar to mercury s @xcite , and nodal precession ( a wobble of the orbital plane ) due to relativistic frame dragging @xcite .",
    "noting these facts , @xcite proposed the relativistic precession model in which the high khz qpo frequency @xmath39 is identified with the keplerain frequency of an orbit in the disk ( similar to the beat - frequency model ) and the low khz qpo frequency @xmath42 with the periastron precession of that orbit .",
    "they also compared the nodal precession of the same orbit to the frequency of one of the observed low - frequency ( @xmath47hz ) in lmxbs .    in this model",
    "the khz peak separation varies as @xmath48 caused by the relativistic nodal precession and the relativistic periastron precession @xcite .",
    "here @xmath49 is the star s moment of inertia and @xmath50 the orbital radius . @xcite and @xcite noticed that stellar oblateness affects both precession rates and",
    "must be corrected for .",
    "using acceptable neutron star parameters , they obtained an approximate match with the observed @xmath42 , @xmath39 and @xmath51 relations provided @xmath51 is _ twice _ ( or perhaps sometimes four times ) the nodal precession frequency @xcite .",
    "however , to get a more precise match between model and observations , one needs to use additional free parameters @xcite .    in this model @xmath45 and @xmath52",
    "are not expected to be equal as in a beat - frequency interpretations .",
    "an interesting result of the relativistic precession model is that @xmath45 should decrease not only when @xmath39 increases ( as observed ) but also when it sufficiently decreases .",
    "although the relativistic precession model explains the three most prominent frequencies observed in the x - ray spectrum of lmxbs , with the three main general - relativistic frequencies characterizing a free - particle orbit , there are still some unanswered questions . for example",
    ", how stable are precessing and eccentric orbits in a disk , how is the flux modulated at the predicted frequencies , and why does the orbital frequency @xmath39 change with x - ray luminosity ? .",
    "furthermore , from this model relatively high neutron star masses ( @xmath53 ) , relatively stiff equations of state , and neutron star spin frequencies in the @xmath54hz range are obtained .",
    "in the last few decades there was a large expansion of the exploration of the near - earth , plasma environment .",
    "one of the recent advances in the space plasma physics is the proof of the connection between flrs and auroral dynamics @xcite .",
    "@xcite use a combination of ground based and satellite observations with analytical and computational models to demonstrate a connection between flrs and the formation of auroral arcs . @xcite",
    "outline a possibility that the flrs are a triggering mechanism for the nonlinear plasma instabilities that occur in the near - earth magnetotail during magnetospheric substorms .",
    "since flrs are a generic feature exciting in magnetized plasmas with gradients in the alfvn velocity and with reflection boundaries , they are likely to occur in accreting neutron star magnetospheres as well . in the following sections we outline the occurrence of the resonant coupling within the ideal mhd approach and illustrate the resonance mechanism with some simple examples .",
    "we present results of computational models of shear alfvn waves in dipolar magnetic field , and we discuss the effect of an ambient flow parallel to the field .",
    "in this section we study mhd and applications to alfvn waves and flrs . in general , the dynamics of a magnetized plasma is described by plasma density @xmath55 , plasma pressure @xmath56 , gravitational potential @xmath57 , velocity vector @xmath58 and magnetic field @xmath59 : @xmath60 an adiabatic equation of state with an adiabatic index @xmath61 , @xmath62const .",

    "although the occurrence of these resonances is generic and likely to be excited in any magnetosphere with input of compressional of energy , one must carefully evaluate the differences between the earth and neutron star magnetospheres . in the case of the earth s magnetosphere , due to the small gravitational attraction of the earth and also its large distance from the sun , the solar wind more or less hits the whole sunward side of the geomagnetosphere , and produces the so - called bow shock structure at the outer boundary .",

    "the large flux of plasma stresses the outer star s magnetosphere and creates a relatively high plasma density throughout the magnetic field .",
