    "it s nice to work with well - sampled astronomical images .",
    "a well - sampled image can be readily resampled to various scales , orientations , or more complex geometries without loss of information .",
    "its spatial resolution is well - understood , permitting a clear analysis of the relative contributions of information and noise .",
    "further , many image processing algorithms will only work on well - sampled data . in some cases , however , it s not practical or even desirable to obtain well - sampled images . given detectors with a finite number of pixels and significant readout noise , one may prefer to trade - off resolution for increased field size or photometric sensitivity .",
    "both considerations were central to the design of the _ hst _ wfpc-1 and wfpc-2 cameras , to give examples of instruments that produce undersampled astronomical images .",
    "wfpc-2 in particular has generated the largest library of high - resolution optical astronomical images to date , but ironically the severe undersampling in the wfc system , and the still less than critical sampling of the pc at all but the reddest wavelengths , limit the resolution of _ hst _ observations as much as the telescope optics , themselves .    there is no magic that can undo the undersampling in a single image ; analysis of such data always requires respect for their peculiarities . at the same time , it may be possible to obtain additional observations with the same camera system that contain information lost in the original images .",
    "for example , if the camera can be offset by a fraction of a pixel over a sequence of exposures or `` dithered , '' one can observe how the structure of objects in the image varies with respect to their positions on the pixel - grid , and thus recover details not contained in any single image .",
    "this suggests that one might construct a well - sampled super - image from a set of undersampled , but dithered images .",
    "in general , when the size of a pixel is important with respect to the intrinsic point - spread function ( psf ) , the image as observed is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the intrinsic projected appearance of the astronomical field being imaged , @xmath2 is the psf due to the telescope and camera optics , and @xmath3 is the spatial form of the pixel itself , ( which is often assumed to be a uniform square , although this need not be the case ) , and @xmath4 means convolution .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 limit the resolution of @xmath5 and thus implicitly specify the minimum sampling requirements  a dilemma if @xmath3 is too big , since it sets what the sampling really is , regardless of what s needed .",
    "if the astronomical scene and camera are time - stable , however , dithering the camera allows proper sampling of the field _ convolved with the pixel response _ as well as the psf , to be obtained .",
    "if the camera is pointed on a fine and regular @xmath6 grid of sub - pixel steps , where @xmath7 is the number of substeps within the original large pixel , then the images can be simply interleaved into a super - image that has small pixels equal to the dither step - size .",
    "if the step - size is small enough , the super - image will be critically sampled . a simple way to view",
    "this is to consider an image consisting of the astronomical field just convolved with the psf due to the optics alone .",
    "the sampling would be done on pixels equal to the size of the dither step , chosen to be fine enough to ensure critical sampling .",
    "the image is then blurred by the original pixel response .",
    "drawing every @xmath8 pixel in @xmath9 and @xmath10 clearly recreates one of the dithered images as actually created by the camera .",
    "therefore , conversely interleaving the dithered images creates the well - sampled super - image .    in practice , however , it may not be possible to step the camera in a regular pattern .",
    "sub - pixel dithers have been used in many wfpc-2 programs , for example , but were often not executed with enough precision to fall on a regular pattern ; simple interlacing of the image - set can not be done in such cases .",
    "this problem is critical for the _ hubble deep field _ ( hdf ) observations ( williams et al .",
    "a regular dither was specified , but did not actually occur .    to solve the problem of combining images with an irregular dither pattern , a _",
    "drizzle_-algorithm was developed ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; fruchter & hook 1998 ) that works by simply dropping or `` drizzling '' the pixels in any single image onto a finer grid , offsetting the image by the actual sub - pixel step obtained , slicing up its pixels as they fall on the finer grid .",
    "the _ drizzle _",
    "algorithm worked well , producing the now famous well - sampled full - color image of the hdf .",
    "the _ drizzle _",
    "algorithm is appealing , as it is intuitive  one is just shifting and overlapping the images on a fine grid , shrinking the original pixels small enough so as to minimize any blurring associated with forcing the pixels into the new grid , but keeping them big enough so that there are no `` holes '' of empty data in the new super image . further , because _ drizzle _ works in the spatial domain , it s easy to correct for cosmic ray events , hot pixels , or any other data missing in any single images , as well as correcting for any geometric distortion .",
    "development of _ drizzle _ represents a significant improvement in the software available to astronomers for analyzing undersampled images , and has greatly improved the recovery of information from _ hst _ images .    despite the success of _ drizzle , _ however , it is frankly justified on intuitive rather than formal theoretical grounds , and indeed depends on two _ ad hoc _ parameters , namely the spacing of the super - image grid and the size of the pixels to be drizzled .",
    "it also introduces its own blurring function , @xmath11 which _ statistically _ is about the size of the super - image pixel ; in detail , the actual resolution for any object depends on how it falls with respect to the final grid .",
    "although @xmath12 in practice may be much smaller than @xmath13 it still may be large compared to the psf and introduce significant blurring in its own right .",
    "these issues were indeed discussed in the context of the hdf , and limit its deconvolution or interpretation of its power spectrum on the finest scales .    in attempt to develop an algorithm that both mines better resolution from the data , and stands on a solid theoretical foundation , i present a method that reconstructs a super - image from an arbitrary set of dithered observations with no - degradation of resolution .",
    "this method is only a modest extension to two - dimensional data of a method for recovering one - dimensional functions from undersampled data presented by bracewell ( 1978 ) .",
    "the method works by computing the fourier transform of the super - image as a linear combination of the transforms of the individual images ; the aliased components are eliminated algebraically .",
    "i have also extended the method to estimate the super - image when it is actually overdetermined by the dithered observations .",
    "none of this is particularly complex , and not surprizingly , the professional image processing literature already contains discussions of this method ( see tsai & huang 1984 , or kim et al .",
    "however , given the strong interest in using dithers in the context of _ hst _ imaging , i considered it worthwhile to present this paper as a tutorial on the method of fourier algebraic reconstruction and explore its use in the context of _ hst _ observations .",
    "to understand how to reconstruct an image from undersampled data , i start by considering the effects of sampling on a 1-d function , @xmath14 for reconstruction to work , @xmath15 must be band - limited , so that its fourier transform , @xmath16 is non - zero only for @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the critical frequency .",
    "if @xmath9 is expressed in terms of pixels , then sampling at every integer pixel is sufficient provided that @xmath19 this can be understood by considering the fourier transform of the sampled function , the sampling of @xmath15 is equivalent to multiplying it by a _",
    "shah_-function , @xmath20 where @xmath21 for the specific case of integer - pixel sampling .",
    "the fourier transform of the sampled function is then , @xmath22 where i have used the fact that the transform of a shah - function is itself a shah - function .",
    "as is well - known , the fourier transform of a sampled function is periodic , repeating over the entire frequency domain . if @xmath15 is band - limited , however , none of the copies or satellites of @xmath23 overlap .",
    "the satellites are spaced at each integer - step in @xmath24 but the requirement that @xmath25 means that they also reach zero before crossing over the midpoint of the interval ( figure [ fig : alias ] ) .",
    "this condition is no longer obeyed when the sampling interval is larger than each integer pixel step .",
    "for example , if every other pixel is sampled , then , @xmath26 the transformed shah - function now samples at every half - integer step in the fourier domain , causing strong overlaps or _ aliasing _ between the satellites of @xmath23 ( figure [ fig : alias ] ) . if @xmath15 is unknown , the full extent of its transform can not be deduced from the aliased sample , which in turn means that the sample is itself an incomplete representation of @xmath14      bracewell ( 1978 ) shows that a function can be recovered from collection of undersampled data - sets given prior knowledge of @xmath18 ( as might exist given a detector pixel shape and optical point - spread function ) , provided that the sampling among the various data - sets is interlaced by some fraction of the sampling interval and that the basic sampling interval is not too sparse compared to @xmath27 consider again the alternate pixel sample above ( which i relabel as @xmath28 ) . for the fundamental interval @xmath29 @xmath30 since i have specified that @xmath23 is band - limited to @xmath31 for @xmath32 @xmath33 and for @xmath34 @xmath35 now let there be a second data set that also samples @xmath15 with alternate pixel spacing , but spatially offset from the @xmath28 samples by some @xmath36 ( one might presume @xmath37 but this is not required ) .",
    "the transform of the new data - set , @xmath38 is @xmath39 this reduces to @xmath40 note that @xmath41 is no less aliased than is @xmath42 but since the overlap portion has a differing phase , the transforms of the two samples can be combined to solve for the transform of @xmath43 @xmath44 in other words , one can reconstruct @xmath15 exactly from two data - sets offset from each other , each undersampled by a factor two .",
    "note that in the special case , where @xmath45 @xmath28 holds the even - numbered pixels and @xmath41 holds the odd - numbered ones , then @xmath46 as would be expected , since the sum in equation ( [ 1dsum ] ) can clearly be separated this way . with exact interlacing , one can just add the transforms of the two individual data - sets ( provided that the transform preserves their relative phases ) .",
    "this method can be directly generalized to the case of reconstructing a 2-d image .",
    "the shah - function becomes a 2-d regular grid of @xmath47-functions , and the two - dimensional fourier transform of an image is : @xmath48 if there is an observation @xmath49 that is factor of two undersampled in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( thus having 1/4 of the pixels of the critically sampled image ) , and offset by @xmath50 from the nominal grid defining @xmath51 then in the domain @xmath52 @xmath53 there are analogous expressions in the other three quadrants of the @xmath54 plane ; however , for real - valued images , half of the @xmath54 plane will simply be the complex conjugate of the other half and thus need not be computed ( see figure [ fig:2x2 ] ) . as can be seen , with four data - sets , each having a unique offset in @xmath9 _ or _",
    "@xmath55 it is again possible to eliminate the overlap contributions .",
    "this requires solving a system of equations with complex coefficients : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a 4-vector holding @xmath58 in the first position , followed by the @xmath24 @xmath59 and lastly @xmath54 satellites , @xmath60 is a 4-vector of the transforms of the 4 undersampled data - sets .",
    "one can then invert this matrix to find @xmath61 where @xmath62 will be a complex coefficient .",
    "solution for the second quadrant is analogous  the phases differ only in sign , being positive when the domain of the frequency is negative . as an example , for the special case of where the four data - sets contain the exact interlaces of integer pixels in @xmath9 and @xmath55 * f * and * d * are more simply related as : @xmath63 which has the solution , as expected of @xmath64      four images determine @xmath65 exactly , but if one actually has additional images available , @xmath58 is overdetermined , and a least squares solution is required .",
    "this means finding the @xmath58 that minimizes the norm @xmath66 where , as above @xmath67 is the matrix of phases . in this case , however , @xmath67 is now an @xmath68 matrix , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of data - sets , and @xmath60 is now a vector of length @xmath7 holding the data - sets ; @xmath57 is still the same 4-vector .",
    "expanding equation ( [ norm ] ) gives @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the hermitian ( or complex - conjugate ) transpose .",
    "minimizing @xmath73 implies @xmath74    in the case of an overdetermined situation , one might further want to weight the observations differently .",
    "for example , it may not be practical to obtain exposures of identical length over the sequence of observations , or they may have variable backgrounds . in this case , it s easy to generalize equation ( [ f2d ] ) to include weighting , giving @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an @xmath6 matrix of weights and @xmath77 is its transpose ( the weights are real - valued ) .",
    "@xmath76 can account for any covarience between the images , but it is most likely to be diagonal on the presumption that the individual images will probably be independent .",
    "double sampling is likely to be sufficient to remove modest aliasing , but higher levels of subsampling may be required when the undersampling is severe .",
    "generalization to finer levels of subsampling is straight forward , if somewhat tedious .",
    "as the observed images become coarser with respect to the reconstructed image , the aliased satellites become closer together and overlap more severely . algebraic elimination of the satellites",
    "requires identifying all satellites contributing power to a given location in the fourier domain . in practice , this means slicing the fourier domain into an increasingly large number of subsets .",
    "figure [ fig:3x3 ] sketches out the structure of the fourier domain for @xmath78 subsampling . in the @xmath78 case ,",
    "the fourier domain is divided into six regions , with nine differing satellites contributing to @xmath57 in each one ; at least @xmath79 dithered images will be required to find a solution , and @xmath67 is will now be an @xmath80 matrix .",
    "an important distinction between the @xmath81 and @xmath78 cases , is that in the former , since the satellites are spaced exactly by @xmath82 only the six satellites that are visible within the fourier semi - domain need be considered . in the @xmath78 case ,",
    "the satellites are separated only by multiples of @xmath83 thus the first set of satellites with their _ centers _ actually falling outside the semi - domain will still overlap with it .",
    "the present reconstruction method works only if the data satisfies a number of conditions , the most important of which is that the intrinsic image structure remain constant over the extent of the dithered data - taking sequence .",
    "the psf should not vary significantly in time , or if the dither steps are large , in space as well .",
    "`` significantly '' in this context means variations on spatial scales where the fourier @xmath84 ratio is greater than unity ; bright point sources are more vulnerable to psf - variations than faint or more diffuse sources .",
    "bright noise spikes , hot pixels , cosmic ray hits , or any other variable sources , must also be eliminated or repaired prior to reconstruction .",
    "a final obvious requirement is that reconstruction can work only on the portions of the dither set in common to all images ; as the dither takes place , it is likely that a larger region of the sky will be imaged than is present on any single image  subimages of the common overlap region must be isolated prior to reconstruction .",
    "the mathematics of the fourier reconstruction method do not strictly require that the angular size of the pixels be constant over the extent of any image , provided that the dither steps are small enough that they can be regarded as constant over the complete area of the images .",
    "images that have variations in their pixel scale large enough so that the amplitude of the dithers ( in pixels ) varies significantly over the extent of the image must be processed in subsets small enough that the dithers can be regarded as constant over the angular domain selected .",
    "lastly , the dithers must be translational only , with no rotation .",
    "the reader familiar with _",
    "drizzle _ may object that these requirements are too restrictive for many sets of dithered data .",
    "_ drizzle _ performs cosmic ray event and defect rejection , as well as geometric rectification , when building a sub - sampled image .",
    "_ drizzle _ is thus attractive for the complete reduction of panoramic data sets .",
    "this issue will be discussed further in @xmath85 but i emphasize that the present approach is solely concerned with the specific task of accurate reconstruction of a nyquist - sampled image .",
    "geometric rectification or defect rejection are problems that can be separated from the actual reconstruction algorithm ; the caveats presented above do not necessarily prevent use of the present method if they can be addressed apart from the reconstruction task .",
    "two other requirements on the data set concern the pattern and measurement of the dithers .",
    "ideally , the fractional portion of the dither steps ( that is ignoring the integer number of pixels stepped over ) should match the nominal @xmath81 or @xmath78 equal sub - stepping patterns as closely as possible ; or if the problem is heavily overdetermined be at least evenly spread over the area of a single pixel . in this case ,",
    "solution of equation ( [ f2w ] ) will generate a set of complex coefficients , @xmath62 of nearly equal power ( presuming equal weights ) .",
    "formally solutions can be calculated for any nondegenerate dither pattern ; however , as the dither pattern moves away from optimal , the images will be combined unevenly , with heavy weight being placed on those with less redundant positions . for real images , this means that the relative noise contributed by such images will be amplified compared to others in the dither set .",
    "noise properties of the reconstructed image will be discussed below ; in practice , excess amplification of noise is only important for large departures from an ideal pattern .",
    "accurate measurement of the dither steps is required to construct the @xmath86 matrix .",
    "this may be done iteratively .",
    "initially one might use simple centroids of stars or other compact objects within a given image to measure dither offsets .",
    "once a reconstructed image has been generated , it can be cross - correlated with the individual images to refine the offsets ; permitting a more accurate reconstruction to be done in a second iteration .      given the prepared set of dithered images and measured dither steps , computation of the reconstructed image can proceed . in practice",
    "i have done this within the vista image processing system , making use of its native image arithmetic and fourier routines , augmenting it only with a new subroutine to construct @xmath87 and then solve for and apply @xmath62 to the fourier transform of a given image .    for each image ,",
    "the first steps are to normalize it to a common exposure level , and to then expand it into a sparse array , spacing out the pixels by @xmath88 or @xmath89 as desired .",
    "each pixel in an input image then occupies one of the corners of a cell of @xmath81 or @xmath78 new pixels in the expanded image , with the other @xmath90 pixels in each cell set to zero .",
    "this actualizes each image as a sparse  function ; one can see that for exact @xmath6 dithers , the other images would simply be interlaced at the vacant locations .",
    "once an image is expanded , its fourier transform is computed ; a power spectrum at this stage clearly shows the aliased satellites .",
    "the next step is to multiply the transform by @xmath62 , remembering that different coefficients must be used for the various regions within the domain .",
    "the adjusted transform is then added to the adjusted transforms of the other images .",
    "the reconstructed image is the inverse transform of the complete sum .",
    "one important caveat is that each the transform of each image must be multiplied by a complex phase , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is its spatial offset from the average of the other images , and @xmath93 is the degree of subsampling .",
    "this is required because the mathematics presented in the previous section presume a two - dimensional coordinate system anchored to the sky , rather than the grid of the detector . in other words , as each image is expanded , initially its  function has identical coordinates to those in the other images , with the object apparently moving with respect to the detector coordinate system .",
    "this step resets the coordinate system to that of the sky , correctly phasing the various  functions of the dither set .",
    "figures [ fig : pc_psf ] and [ fig : wfc_psf ] show pc and wfc psfs    reconstructed from a calibration program of 20 f555w dithered images of a field within the @xmath94 cen globular cluster .",
    "the pc psf was reconstructed with @xmath81 subsampling , while @xmath78 subsampling was used for the wfc psf .",
    "the cores of the psfs are now well resolved , and no `` boxy '' artifacts are seen as can occur in _ drizzle _ reconstructions ( fruchter & hook 1998 ) .",
    "it s also worthwhile to note the strong blurring introduced by the wfc pixel function , @xmath13 itself .",
    "again , the reconstruction does not recover the intrinsic psf due to the optics only , but the intrinsic psf convolved with @xmath95 the pc psf clearly has the sharper and rounder core , while the center of the wfc psf is strongly determined by the pixel shape .",
    "figure [ fig : power ] shows the power spectra at various stages in the reconstruction of the wfc psf to illustrate    the algorithm concretely .",
    "the final combination of 20 images has reduced the contribution of the aliased satellites by @xmath96 the final power spectrum also ratifies the strong contribution of the wfc pixel to the total psf .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is clearly boxy ; further , the central lobe is surrounded by a strong zero , which would be expected in the power spectrum of a nearly square and uniform pixel function .",
    "turning to more interesting objects , figure [ fig : n1023 ] shows the @xmath81 reconstruction of the nucleus of the early - type galaxy ngc 1023 .",
    "unlike the situation for the psfs , which were highly overdetermined , only five dithered images were available for ngc 1023 .",
    "the dither pattern was close to a nominal exact interlace , but the offsets typically differed from the nominal 0.5 pixel by @xmath97 pixel , thus the present method was required .",
    "this galaxy has a particularly compact center ( lauer et al .",
    "the present observations were obtained to observe its central structure with the best resolution available  reconstructing the image without introducing additional blurring is thus critical .",
    "the reconstructed image clearly shows the sharp compact nucleus of ngc 1023 , but is also smooth and free from artifact ; indeed this image can now be processed further with psf deconvolution .",
    "lastly , i show a @xmath81 reconstruction of a chain - galaxy at @xmath98 ( cohen et al .",
    "1996 ) in the _ hubble deep field _ ( figure [ fig : hdf_gal ] ) , along with a _ drizzle _ reconstruction .",
    "superficially the two images look identical ; the gross morphology is not strongly dependent on the reconstruction algorithm",
    ".    detailed comparison shows , however , that the present reconstruction is slightly sharper  the peak of the brightest knot in the image is @xmath99 brighter , for example . matching the resolution of the _ drizzled _ image requires smoothing the fourier reconstruction with a gaussian with @xmath100 pixel ( on the subsampled scale ) . the fourier reconstruction does appear to have more noise , but again this is due to the smoothing inherent in the _ drizzle _ algorithm . the fourier reconstruction can be smoothed , but one of the nice things about having a well - sampled image is that optimal filters can be used to improve its appearance .",
    "a weiner filter , for example , can be used to reject much of the noise in the present image with little effect on its resolution ; an option that is not possible with aliased images .",
    "a more general comparison of the present method to _ drizzle _ is complex , as the difference between the two depends on the dither pattern , the size of the image set , choice of the reconstructed pixel size , and the _ drizzle _ drop size .",
    "for example , when the dither pattern is close to an exact interlace , _ drizzle _ can be configured to produce a simple interlaced reconstruction , while at the opposite end of the scale , _ drizzle _ can do simple `` shift - and - add '' reconstructions on the original pixel scale , which implies highly significant smoothing . in general",
    ", it appears from a number of additional experiments that when a large image set is available , _ drizzle _ effectively smooths a perfect reconstruction with a gaussian with width of about one pixel , as in the hdf galaxy above . for wfc psfs , for example ,",
    "the blurring can cause a 10%  reduction in the flux of the central pixel .",
    "this is not guaranteed , however ; in one wfc psf experiment with only four nearly exactly interlaced images , _ drizzle _ produced a result that was apparently _ sharper _ than the fourier reconstruction .",
    "close examination , however , showed that the _ drizzle _ result was still aliased ; aliasing can cause features to be artificially sharpened as well as broadened . further comparison of the fourier method to _ drizzle _ is thus best done in a context specific to the scientific problem at hand .",
    "as alluded to in @xmath101 the noise level in the reconstructed image depends on how well the dither pattern matches an ideal interlace pattern . for @xmath102 images ,",
    "the solutions presented in equations ( [ f2d ] ) or ( [ f2w ] ) reduce to a set of complex coefficients @xmath103 relating @xmath58 to the data , as in the exact solution shown in equation ( [ comb ] ) . on the presumption that the noise from image to image is uncorrelated , then the average power in noise in the reconstructed image",
    "is simply @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the noise power in image @xmath106 with a nearly ideal dither pattern ( and equally - weighted data ) , @xmath107 where @xmath93 is the degree of subsampling ; the noise level is as expected for the simple addition of @xmath102 images .",
    "as the dither pattern becomes less ideal , however , unequal weight is placed on the images , depending on the uniqueness of their positions .",
    "highly redundant images will have small coefficients , while more isolated images contribute relatively higher power .",
    "the linear combination of the images still produces an exact solution for the reconstructed image , but because the noise is incoherent from image to image it may be amplified in the final image , relative to its level in the ideal case",
    ". equation ( [ noise_lev ] ) allows the noise in the reconstructed image to be calculated in advance for any particular dither pattern .",
    "figure [ fig : noise ] gives shows how the noise level in the reconstructed    image varies as the dither pattern moves away from the ideal interlace for two examples of @xmath81 subsampling . in these tests , variations in the dither pattern were treated as random gaussian errors about the exact interlace . for a given standard deviation of the random offset ,",
    "several simulated image reconstructions were computed . for the example with only four images , there is no redundant information , and the noise level depends strongly on the particulars of the dither pattern once excursions from the exact interlace become large . for nine images",
    "the reconstruction is more stable to departures from the ideal pattern , the final noise level showing less large excursions .",
    "the real importance of this demonstration , however , is to show that the noise level rises only slowly above its ideal for small errors in the dither pattern .",
    "experience with wfpc-2 , for example , shows that typical dithering errors ( @xmath108 pc pixel ) will give results within the regime of modest noise amplification .",
    "as noted in the introduction , my interest in the fourier reconstruction method presented here stemmed from a strong desire to avoid the random blurring , @xmath11 that _ drizzle _ may introduce into the reconstructed image .",
    "the present method permits exact reconstruction of the superimage , with no blurring at the nyquist scale , nor requires any arbitrary decisions or parameters to control the form of the reconstructed image",
    ". one might object that the degree of subsampling selected is such a parameter ; however , it is really specified by the intrinsic spatial scale of the nyquist frequency",
    ". a nyquist - sampled image can be resampled at finer scales without loss of information content or introduction of artifact  images generated at various subsampling scales past the nyquist scale are essentially equivalent representations of the image .",
    "the present algorithm places several preconditions on the data , thus it is worthwhile to consider 1 ) the optimal data - taking strategy for reconstructing images from dithered data - sets , and 2 ) how to best perform the related tasks of artifact rejection , geometric rectification , and so on .",
    "the mathematics of the fourier method strongly recommends selecting a dither pattern that contains fractional offsets as close to the ideal interlace pattern , itself .",
    "if a good dither pattern is realized , little is demanded of the linear combination of the images  one is simply accounting for the slight errors in its execution . it should be emphasized that the dither pattern can also contain integer pixel offsets as well , as might be desired to eliminate hot pixels , traps , blocked columns , and other fixed detector defects as well as cosmic rays . a nearly ideal program for the present algorithm would be to attempt a @xmath81 subsampling interlace , but taking multiple exposures at each dither step to allow for cosmic ray rejection .",
    "this strategy clearly demands a rather large data - set , which may not be feasible for programs lasting only an orbit or two on _ hst .",
    "_ however , it presents no difficulties for multi - orbit programs , where one will be obtaining a large number of exposures in any case .    with regards to the second issue above ,",
    "i have focused solely on the problem of reconstructing a nyquist - sampled image .",
    "tasks that are required before this stage include image registration and defect repair .",
    "tasks that might follow reconstruction include geometric rectification , deconvolution , and filtering .",
    "_ drizzle _ is attractive in part because it is a complete package that does many of these steps together within the familiar iraf / stsdas environment .",
    "this said , however , i emphasize that many of the preliminary reduction steps can be done independently of the fourier reconstruction algorithm  these issues should not impede its use . indeed , one might use _ drizzle _ for an initial reconstruction to provide for defect rejection prior to a second reconstruction cycle using the present algorithm .",
    "geometric rectification is simple in principle if one is working with well - sampled images ; the issue is generating such an image if geometric distortions are important in the undersampled observations . as noted earlier ,",
    "if the dithers are small , scale changes across the image may be unimportant ; if variations in the local dither step over the image domain are limited to a few percent of a pixel , then the entire domain may be reconstructed , and then later rectified .",
    "if the dither steps are large , however , the fractional pixel offsets may vary significantly over the image , requiring the reconstruction to be done in subsets of the domain and later patched together .",
    "this may be unattractive for some problems requiring panoramic imaging , but may be irrelevant if the primary objects of interest are compact or occupy only small portions of the images .    while the fourier reconstruction method presented here works only for translational dithers , in passing ,",
    "i note that the professional image processing literature does contain algorithms related to be present one that can combine undersampled images with more complex geometric interrelationships .",
    "granrath & lersch ( 1998 ) present an algorithm that constructs a nyquist - sampled image from an image set whose members can be related to each other with affine transformations , i. e. , the geometric transformations that include rotation , scale change , and shear , as well as simple translations . the granrath & lersch algorithm constructs a `` projection - onto - convex - sets '' estimate that gives the best reproduction of the image set , in contrast to the present method , which yields a closed - form solution to the nyquist image .",
    "methods of this sort may be of interest in cases where the image does not meet the conditions required for the present fourier method , but precise treatment of the nyquist - scale is still important .    in summary",
    ", the fourier technique presented here may not be the first choice to construct a nyquist image when the geometrical relationships among the image set are complex , or the dither pattern is strongly non - optimal .",
    "further , its resolution gains may appear to be superficially modest .",
    "regardless , there remains a class of _ hst _ imaging problems that push right against the diffraction scale of the instrument .",
    "this class includes crowded field stellar photometry , the nuclear structure of galaxies  particularly those with bright agn , the morphology of lensed qsos , and so on .",
    "this method allows clean access to the nyquist scale and should be of use for these problems and more .",
