    "jupiter family comets ( jfcs ) originate in the transneptunian region of the solar system known as the kuiper belt .",
    "kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) preserve key information about the epoch of planetesimal formation .",
    "the low ambient temperature ( @xmath6 k ) allows kbos to retain most if not all of the ices present in their formation environment .",
    "this makes them valuable time capsules with which to study an epoch long gone .",
    "jfcs represent the small end of the steep size distribution of kbos .",
    "they are survivors of a dynamically intermediate population , the centaurs , that were neither ejected from the solar system nor collided with one of the giant planets ( jupiter to neptune ) on their journey from the kuiper belt into the inner solar system .",
    "the surfaces of jfcs are heavily processed when compared to kbos , mainly by sublimation of surface ice .",
    "indeed , the optical broadband colours of the two populations differ substantially : jfcs have typically solar ( neutral ) colours ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , with a spread of about 0.2 mag @xcite while kbos span a broad range of optical colours , from neutral ( @xmath9 ) to very red ( @xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the neutral surfaces are usually attributed to a fresh ice coating while very red surfaces are thought to be the end product of irradiation of initially neutral material @xcite .",
    "the intermediate centaurs present a peculiar , also intermediate distribution of colours which includes neutral objects ( blue group ) and very red objects ( red group ) but very few cases in between .",
    "this centaur colour bimodality may be related to their dynamical history or simply to the fact that they are small @xcite .",
    "some objects straddle the line between centaurs and jfcs .",
    "they are active , like jfcs , but have centaur - like orbits .",
    "a famous example is 29p / schwassmann - wachmann 1 ( hereafter 29p ) .",
    "the orbit of 29p is nearly circular ( @xmath11 ) with perihelion and semimajor axis beyond jupiter ( @xmath12 au and @xmath13 au ) , and obeys the dynamical definition of a centaur .",
    "29p is constantly active and displays sporadic photometric outbursts .",
    "the activity of 29p is mainly driven by carbon monoxide sublimation @xcite .",
    "comet 29p has a radius @xmath14 km ( yan fernndez , private comm . ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of comet p/2010  to20 linear - grauer ( hereafter p / lg ) which is in many respects similar to 29p .",
    "comet p / lghas a low eccentricity ( @xmath1 ) , high perihelion ( @xmath0 au ) orbit , very close to meeting the centaur definition ( see table [ table.elements ] , fig .  [ fig.orbit ] ) . when p / lg  was discovered by the lincoln near earth asteroid research ( linear ) survey , on 1 october 2010 , it was misclassified as a trojan and its weak activity went unnoticed .",
    "we present optical broadband measurements of p / lg  and numerical simulations of its orbital evolution .",
    "the former show that p / lg  is weakly active , at a level comparable to the active centaurs @xcite while the latter indicate that p / lghas in all likelihood recently evolved into its current location from a centaur orbit .",
    "the implication is that p / lg  may offer a glimpse of a relatively small and fresh centaur object .",

    "comet 29p colours from @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig.psone ] shows p / lg  as seen by the panstarrs ps1 survey ( see  [ sec.observations ] ) close to the time the comet was discovered by linear .",
    "the ps1 images show that p / lg  was active at the time of discovery and yet the linear pipeline first classified this object as a jovian trojan .",
    "this suggests that linear may have misclassified several active objects as inert asteroids , which is an important point to consider at a time when the study of active asteroids is receiving increasing interest ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "our data reveal that p / lg  was active in october 2010 , roughly 60past perihelion , and remains active a year later , at 90  past perihelion .",
    "p / lg s nearly circular orbit , atypical for a jfc , leads us to consider a number of explanations for its activity .",
    "one possibility is that p / lg  has been activated by a recent collision with a smaller object .",
    "we find this unlikely : our simulations show that p / lg  spent only a negligible fraction of its recent past within the trojan clouds ( but see below ) , and even there the chance of a collision onto its @xmath18 km nucleus would be low .",
    "another possibility is that p / lg  was exposed to significant tidal stress due to close approaches to jupiter .",
    "this scenario would require encounters with jupiter closer than the roche limit ( mass shedding begins at @xmath19 for a comet on a parabolic orbit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which our simulations show to be improbable .",
    "it is also possible that p / lgbecame active due to rotational mass shedding but since the rotation period of p / lg  is not known this possibility is untestable .",
    "one scenario that our simulations can not rule out is that p / lg  originated in the trojan population and was disloged from the 1:1 resonance with jupiter through the action of non - gravitational effects ( see  [ sec.dynamics ] ) .",
    "conceivably , p / lg  could have been collisionally actived by a smaller trojan and led to drift from the stable region , accelerated by mass - loss jets ; we note that p / lg s highly unstable orbit implies a recent departure from the trojan region .",
    "modelling this possibility is a complex task involving a number of unknown parametres and is beyond the scope of this paper but future observations of this comet may shed light on a possible link with the trojan population .",
    "the activity of p / lg  could simply be due to ice sublimation . at first sight ,",
    "the small difference between the p / lg  perihelion and aphelion distances ( table [ table.elements ] ) , and the consequently small orbital variation of the subsolar equilibrium temperature ( @xmath20 k ) could seem insufficient to power periodic sublimation activity .",
    "however , between the perihelion and aphelion distances of p / lg , the specific mass loss rate due to water ice sublimation varies by more than an order of magnitude ( from @xmath21 to @xmath22 kg m@xmath23 s@xmath5 ) while co / co@xmath24 sublimation driven mass loss varies by a factor of 2 and is around @xmath25 kg m@xmath23 s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we find that p / lg  loses mass into the coma at a rate @xmath26 kg s@xmath5 implying that an area of @xmath27 to @xmath28 m@xmath29 would need to be active on the surface of p / lg  if water ice sublimation is the source of the activity .",
    "those areas are small compared to the maximum surface area of the nucleus , @xmath30 m@xmath29 .",
    "sublimation due to co / co@xmath24 would require only an area @xmath31 m@xmath29 to be active , corresponding to a tiny active vent on the surface of the 3 km nucleus .",
    "we conclude that given the recent perihelion passage and the particular range of heliocentric distances traversed by p / lg  since then our estimated current mass loss rate is consistent with the activity being driven by ice sublimation .",
    "p / lg  is in many ways comparable to comet 29p ( see table [ table.comparison ] and fig .  [ fig.comparison ] ) .",
    "both comets have high perihelion ( @xmath32 au ) , low inclination ( @xmath33 ) , nearly circular orbits ( @xmath34 ) more typical of centaurs than jfcs .",
    "both orbits are unstable on very short timescales ( a few hundred years ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two comets show similar levels of activity , with specific mass - loss rates close to @xmath35 kg m@xmath23 s@xmath5 , despite 29p being nearly an order of magnitude larger ( @xmath362 orders of magnitude more massive ) than p / lg .",
    "both objects display continued activity , although the coverage of p / lg  reported here is not enough to establish a pattern of activity",
    ". it will be interesting to see if p / lg s activity is significantly modulated by its orbital motion or if it remains constant as is the case for comet 29p .",
    "it will also of interest to monitor p / lg  and see if it too will display the sporadic outbursts seen in 29p .",
    "significant differences include the size of the comets and the source of activity : 29p is dominated by co sublimation , while p / lg  is more likely active due to water - ice sublimation .",
    "kg m@xmath16 ) .",
    "the arrow indicates that we possess only an upper limit on the nucleus radius of p / lg .",
    "the uncertainty in the radius of 29p is marked by a horizontal error bar .",
    "the size of the p / lg  and 29p points is linearly proportional to their geometric cross - section for visual comparison .",
    "lines of constant specific mass - loss rate are labeled in units of kg m@xmath23 s@xmath5.,width=313 ]",
    "we report photometric observations and numerical simulations of the orbital evolution of the unusual comet p/2010 to20 linear - grauer ( p / lg ) .",
    "our findings can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "comet p / lg  was active at the time of discovery ( october 2010 ) by linear , and remains active in october 2011 .",
    "linear did not detect the activity and initially misclassified p / lg  as a trojan , which suggests that several active objects may have gone undetected by the survey .",
    "the nucleus of p / lg  has equivalent radius @xmath18 km , and colours @xmath3 mag and @xmath4 mag , values typical of jupiter family comets .",
    "the data suggest a slight reddening of the dust colour with distance from the nucleus but the uncertainties are large .",
    "we find no significant rotational photometric variability from the nucleus region .",
    "3 .   we obtain a model - dependent estimate of the mass - loss rate from p / lg  of @xmath37100 kg s@xmath5 .",
    "we favour water - ice sublimation as the simplest and most likely cause for activity in comet p / lg .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the orbit of p / lg  is unstable on very short timescales and suggest that it may be a centaur that recently arrived in the inner solar system , although other possibilities exist involving non - gravitational effects .",
    "comet p / lg  is in a number of ways reminiscent of the well - known 29p / schwassmann - wachmann 1 .",
    "29p is a comet / active centaur that shows sporadic outbursts superimposed on a background of constant activity .",
    "comet p / lg  is an order of magnitude smaller ( three orders of magnitude less massive ) than 29p and yet displays similar activity per unit area .",
    "comets 29p and p / lg  are interesting as possible examples of relatively unprocessed centaurs .",
