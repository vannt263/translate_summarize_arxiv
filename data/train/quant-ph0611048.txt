    "the error due to the interaction with light can be categorized into two parts .",
    "the first is the error due to noise in classical laser parameters , such as intensity or phase @xcite .",
    "the second part originates from the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field and is due to vacuum fluctuations , i.e. the spontaneous scattering of photons @xcite .",

    "this error was also addressed in @xcite . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we examine the error due to rayleigh scattering .",
    "rayleigh scattering error results primarily from the photon s recoil momentum kick .",
    "we show that both types of gate errors can be reduced to small values , while keeping the gate speed constant , with the use of higher laser intensity .",
    "in a raman photon scattering event energy and angular momentum are exchanged between the scattered photon and the ion s internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the polarization and frequency of the scattered photon ( with respect to those of the laser ) become entangled with the ions internal state . therefore , after tracing out the photon degrees of freedom , the ions spin coherence is lost . in other words ,",

    "for a single qubit gate we choose to look at the fidelity of a @xmath34 rotation around the @xmath48-axis of the bloch sphere , represented by the pauli operator @xmath49 .",
    "this gate is assumed to be driven by a co - propagating raman beam pair , where the frequency difference between the beams equals the frequency separation between the two qubit states @xmath14 .",

    "[ p_raman_vs_detuning ] shows @xmath65 vs. @xmath15 .",
    "the raman scattering probability decays quadratically with @xmath15 for @xmath45 .",
    "qualitatively , this is because raman scattering involves a rotation of the electron spin .",
    "electron spin rotations are achieved through the spin - orbit coupling in the excited state .",
    "this coupling has opposite sign contributions from the two fine - structure levels .",
    "therefore as we detune far compared to the fine structure splitting , those two contributions nearly cancel @xcite .    using eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) we can write @xmath66 the ratio @xmath67 can be expressed in terms of atomic constants , and the peak electric field amplitude @xmath68 at the position of the ion @xcite @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the frequency of the transition between the @xmath8 and the @xmath6 levels ( d2 line ) , @xmath71 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath72 is the speed of light . assuming gaussian laser beams , at the center of the beam @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the power in each of the raman beams and @xmath75 is the beam waist at the position of the ion .",

    "the first contribution @xmath77 is due to a difference in the rayleigh scattering rates from the two ground state levels .",
    "assume that the rayleigh scattering rate is @xmath78 from one qubit level and @xmath79 from the other .",
    "a measurement of the qubit level will be conclusive once the difference in the number of photons that are scattered is larger than the standard deviation of the number of photons scattered from each level . since the number of photons that are scattered follows a poisson distribution , a measurement will occur after photons have been scattered for a time @xmath80 such that @xmath81 the error rate is , therefore , given by @xmath82 , and the error during a gate by @xmath83    for the above gate parameters , the difference in scattering rates is due solely to the difference in detuning between the two qubit levels . for @xmath84 , which is typically required to reduce other scattering errors to low levels ,",
    "this error can be approximated by @xmath85 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath77 to the total error at a realistic laser detuning is very small .",
    "we performed an accurate calculation of the difference in the scattering rates between the two clock levels , and verified that indeed , for all ion species and laser detunings discussed above , @xmath77 is negligible .",
    "a second source of rayleigh scattering error is through the contribution of the recoil momentum displacement to non - linearities in the gate evolution .",
    "the gate error due to non - linearities was calculated in @xcite and in the present context is proportional to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the variance of the motional modes distribution due to recoil .",
    "the recoil momentum displacement magnitude is of order @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , starting from the ground state and following a single scattering event , @xmath89 .",
    "the gate error due to this effect will be proportional to @xmath90 , and significantly smaller than other scattering errors discussed above .",
    "we have calculated the errors due to photon scattering in a single - pulse single - qubit gates and two - qubit phase - gates implemented with stimulated raman transitions .",
    "these errors present a fundamental limit to the gate fidelity in trapped - ion qip experiments that use these kinds of gates , and should be a significant factor when choosing a specific ion as a quantum information carrier for fault - tolerant quantum computing schemes .",
    "three main errors occur from spontaneously scattering photons during a gate .",
    "two errors are due to raman scattering either back into the @xmath8 manifold ( @xmath62 ) or to low - lying d levels ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the third error is due to the rayleigh scattering recoil during a two - qubit gate ( @xmath92 ) . for most ions currently considered for qip experiments ,",
    "the dominant error for realistic laser parameters is @xmath62 .",
    "this error can be typically reduced to below current estimates for the fault - tolerance threshold with the use of relatively high ( but probably attainable ) laser power .",
    "this makes the availability of high power laser sources at the relevant wavelength important .",
    "this error is also reduced for ions with a relatively large @xmath93 transition wavelength .    among those three errors , only @xmath94",
    "can not be reduced below a certain value by the use of higher laser intensity .",
    "therefore , it may eventually be advantageous to choose ions that do not have low lying d levels . however , for most ions considered here",
    ", @xmath91 is still small at realistic laser parameters compared to the other raman error @xmath62 .",
    "the masses of the different ions play an interesting role in the scattering error .",
    "since it is harder to transfer momentum to heavier ions , they suffer from a larger @xmath62 in two - qubit gates ( or alternatively from the need for more laser power for a given gate speed and error level ) .",
    "for the same reason , lighter ions suffer from a larger rayleigh recoil error @xmath92 .",
    "examining eqs .",
    "( [ error gate vs. power ] ) and ( [ recoil error ] ) , the raman error scales as @xmath95 and the rayleigh error scales as @xmath96 ( neglecting differences in wavelength and natural linewidths ) . since both @xmath75 and @xmath7 are generally larger for heavier ions , the raman error is larger and rayleigh error is smaller for heavier ions by more than is indicated by the kinetic argument above . since for most ions",
    "@xmath62 is the dominant error , lighter ions seem to currently have a lower overall error due to photon scattering . also , because both errors are a function of @xmath97 lighter ions will reach the same error level and power requirements with a higher @xmath98 when compared to heavier ions .",
    "this allows for faster gate operation . for a given trap geometry and applied potentials , the axial trap frequency scales as @xmath99 and the radial trap frequencies scale as @xmath100 . for the ion crystal to remain along the axial trap direction the radial frequencies have to be larger than the axial frequencies ; therefore the limiting frequency is the radial frequency . in this case",
    ", @xmath97 is independent of the ions mass .",
    "heavier ions under these conditions will have a lower @xmath98 , leading to slower gate operation .    in conclusion ,",
    "to minimize the effect of scattering on the fidelity of trapped - ion - qubit gates , one needs to strike a balance between the desirable characteristics of long wavelength , light mass , the availability of high power laser sources and , if possible , the lack of low lying d levels when choosing a specific ion as a quantum information carrier .    finally , we remind the reader that here we have focused on hyperfine ion - qubits and gates that rely on off - resonant raman transitions applied in a continuous pulse . other kinds of trapped - ion gates or qubits could have different limitations on the gate fidelity due to spontaneous photon scattering .",

    "in section [ section3 ] we calculated the error due to rayleigh photon scattering without considering the scattered photon degrees of freedom .",
    "rather , we considered dephasing due to the random phase that is generated by the scattered photon s recoil .",
    "as noted , we can also view the gate error caused by rayleigh scattering of photons as arising from the entanglement between the photon and the ion - qubit external degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , a photon that is scattered during the gate , while the two spin wave packets are displaced from each other , can be collected by an ideal imaging system .",
    "since the two - ion collective spin is entangled with their position , the position at which the photon is detected at the image plane can give `` which - way '' information , thereby measuring the ions spin , collapsing the entanglement , and causing an error in the gate .",
    "experiments investigating atomic decoherence due to this effect were performed in neutral - atom interferometers @xcite .",
    "this effect was also calculated in @xcite for a single ion in a superposition of two different motional coherent states .",
    "the general equivalence of these two points of view ( dephasing vs. entangling with the environment ) was explained in @xcite .",
    "here we show this equivalence for the trapped ion case where the ion is undergoing an ( ideally ) spin - dependent closed loop displacement . for simplicity",
    "we examine the case of a single ion ; it is , however , straightforward to generalize the following proof to the case of two ions .",
    "we first calculate the final state fidelity by examining entanglement with the photon modes . as in the two - qubit gate",
    ", a single ion is prepared in an equal superposition of spin states and is cooled to the motional ground state : @xmath101 here kets with subscript @xmath102 represent motional states , and kets with the subscript @xmath103 the different photon modes , which are initially empty ( neglecting the laser mode ) .",
    "the ion is subsequently driven by an oscillating force which is detuned from its motional resonance .",
    "the direction of force is opposite for the two different spin states .",
    "ideally the two spin states would traverse opposite circular trajectories in phase space ( in a frame rotating at the motional mode frequency ) . at the end of the gate drive , both parts of the superposition ( ideally ) return to the ground state of motion , and acquire the same geometric phase @xmath104 which is proportional to the phase - space area encircled .",
    "the state at the end of the ideal gate drive is @xmath105    now assume the ion scattered a photon during the gate drive .",
    "immediately before the scattering event , the gate evolution produces @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the conditional phase - space displacement for the two spin states ( we have dropped the subscript @xmath102 ) and @xmath108 is the geometric phase accumulated by the time of scattering .",
    "immediately after scattering , a single photon is created in mode @xmath109 and the ion correspondingly recoils : @xmath110 here @xmath111 is the wave vector difference between the scattered photon and the laser beam .",
    "the delta - function @xmath112 enforces energy conservation .",
    "the electromagnetic field is now represented by a superposition of states in which a single photon was scattered into a certain mode while all other modes are empty .",
    "each part of this superposition is correlated with the corresponding momentum recoil operator acting on the trapped ion .",
    "recoil into directions other than the trap axis will give rise to motion which is common to both parts of the superposition , and can therefore be traced over .",
    "we , therefore , neglect recoil into the dimensions other than the trap axis direction , and approximate @xmath113 , where @xmath114 . by use of eq .",
    "( [ recoil_operator2 ] ) this momentum recoil can be written as a phase space displacement @xmath115 , where @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is the root mean - square of the ground state spatial spread . using eq .",
    "( [ displacements commutation ] ) we add the recoil to the gate displacement and the state after scattering can be written as @xmath118    since the total gate displacement is equal to zero , the remaining part of the gate displacement is @xmath119 ( depending of the spin state ) .",
    "( [ displacements commutation ] ) again , we can write the state of the system after the gate has completed @xmath120 we can now define the gate phase - error @xmath121 , and write the corresponding density operator          note that the coherences of the density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ appendix7 ] ) are given by an average of @xmath125 .",
    "a large spread in @xmath126 will `` wash - out '' coherence and leave an incoherent statistical mixture .",
    "tracing over the motional degrees of freedom we are now ready to evaluate the fidelity with respect to the ideal gate output state ( eq .",
    "( [ appendix1a ] ) ) .",
    "we now turn to calculate the fidelity looking only at dephasing as in sec .",
    "[ recoil_displacement_error ] , i.e. loss of fidelity due to the photon scattering random phase .",
    "the gate output state is then @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the random scattering phase ( eq .",
    "[ phase error2 ] ) .",
    "the fidelity of this state with respect to the ideal gate output state is identical to that calculated considering entanglement with the photon modes in eq .",
