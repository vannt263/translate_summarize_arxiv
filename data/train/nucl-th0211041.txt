    "<S> we determine the influence of the three - body force and the medium modification of meson masses on pairing in nuclear and neutron matter . a reduction of the pairing gap is found and increasing with density .    </S>",
    "<S> the pairing interaction in electron superconductors has a natural cutoff determined by the lattice spacing . on the contrary , in nuclear matter </S>",
    "<S> there is no such sharp cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the realistic bare nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interactions have a smooth behavior which is determined by the fit of the experimental phase shifts of high - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering . however , medium effects strongly modify the @xmath0 interaction in nuclear and neutron matter , including its short - range part @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have still a poor knowledge of these modifications . </S>",
    "<S> all predictions on the pairing gap in nuclear matter suffer from this drawback , as the solution of the gap equation is very sensitive to the value of the tail of the interaction in momentum space @xcite , i.e. , to the short - range behavior of the coordinate - space potential .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the role played in neutron and nuclear matter superfluidity by some mechanisms which may affect the short - range behavior of the pairing force . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon - nucleon correlations ( ladder diagrams ) , which renormalize the short - range part of the interaction much the same as in the brueckner @xmath1-matrix , fix already a kind of cutoff in the gap equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other processes may have a strong influence , such as nucleonic excitations or @xmath2 exchange giving rise to three - body forces ( tbf ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tbf have been proven to play a crucial role for the saturation properties of nuclear matter due to their short - range repulsive nature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a medium modification of the heavy meson masses , which has been addressed as manifestation of the chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear matter@xcite , can modify the range of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> experimental evidence for the latter is provided by dilepton production in high - energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the pairing gap in nuclear matter is determined by the competition between the repulsive short - range part and the attractive long - range part of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the medium modification of the long - range part was confidently obtained within the rpa approximation or induced interaction model , and it was discussed elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the short - range part is partially incorporated by the gap equation itself with the bare interaction . </S>",
    "<S> a simple way @xcite to illustrate this property is to split the gap equation into two coupled equations ,    [ e:1 ] @xmath3    where @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the effective interaction @xmath5 , arising from the introduction of a cutoff @xmath6 in momentum space , sums up a series of ladder diagrams analogous to the bethe - goldstone equation . </S>",
    "<S> we want to stress that @xmath5 and the cutoff are interrelated , so that one can not use a phenomenological interaction in the gap equation and fix arbitrarily the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite sensitive to the tail ( @xmath7 ) of the @xmath0 interaction , which reflects the short - range part of the nuclear force .    a great deal of uncertainty </S>",
    "<S> is associated with the modification of the short - range part of the two - body interaction when going from the vacuum to the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> it is well know that the empirical saturation properties of nuclear matter can not be reproduced with the bare two - body force only , but that one has to include also three - body forces which take into account the medium modification of the in - vacuum @xmath0 interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the three - body forces around the saturation region is mainly to shift to lower density the balance between short - range repulsive and long - range attractive components of the interaction , which mostly dominate above the saturation density ( @xmath8 ) . in the pairing problem </S>",
    "<S> we thus do not expect a remarkable effect in the peak domain of the energy gap ( @xmath9 ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : vr ] we plot the effective two - body force in the @xmath10 channel , obtained from a meson - exchange model of the three - body force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the density dependence arises from the averaging procedure adopted to reduce the three - body force to an effective two - body force @xcite . in neutron </S>",
    "<S> matter the strength of @xmath11 is smaller than in nuclear matter due to the lack of the @xmath12 tensor force . in either case </S>",
    "<S> the strength of @xmath11 is very small in comparison to the two - body force plotted also for comparison in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : vr ] . however , it is mainly effective on the short - range side ( @xmath13 ) and hence it affects @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the repulsion is increasing with rising density .    in order to numerically investigate the effect of the three - body force we have solved the gap equation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e:1 ] ) , adding to the bare two - body force ( the argonne @xmath14 potential@xcite ) the above three - body force . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle spectrum @xmath15 appearing in the gap equation is computed using the same three - body force . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the two cases of @xmath10 pairing between like nucleons embedded in neutron matter and nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the energy gap @xmath16 are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : gaptbf ] . </S>",
    "<S> the gap in nuclear matter is always smaller than in neutron matter , since the single - particle spectrum is different in the two cases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the effect is a slight suppression of the gap , quasi negligible at low density and increasingly larger at higher density in both cases .    since the masses of the exchanged mesons drive the range of the interaction , it is also of interest to discuss in this note to which extent the energy gap is influenced by the change of the properties of the heavy mesons which act at short distances . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , at the present time this approach suffers a great deal of uncertainty , since there is no clear idea about the medium modification of the meson parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is motivated as being due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry , which causes hadron mass scaling @xcite in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> it appears experimentally supported by the quenching of the @xmath17 meson mass in dilepton production in heavy ion collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical treatment @xcite can only be accomplished using an interaction explicitly dependent on the meson parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we use the bonn - b potential @xcite and only investigate the effect of the @xmath18 meson mass , whose strength is by far the largest one . </S>",
    "<S> the bonn - b potential has also been used recently in the relativistic theory of pairing , where it predicts a gap comparable with the result of the nonrelativistic bcs theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have done two sets of calculations : one is obtained by just changing the meson mass ( and consistently the mass cutoff ) in a range independent of the density ; in the other one the change of the mass is connected to the density according to the brown and rho scaling model @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant and @xmath21 is the mass cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling of hadron masses has been proposed to partially restore the chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian in nuclear matter . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : gapmes ] the results are plotted for the two sets of calculations . in order to demonstate the qualitative effect </S>",
    "<S> we solve the gap equation with a free single - particle spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the bonn - b potential has been used as pairing interaction with all meson parameters frozen except for the @xmath18 meson . on the left side of the figure the first set of results </S>",
    "<S> is plotted . </S>",
    "<S> changing the mass of the @xmath18 meson independently of the neutron density amounts to the same change of the range of the interaction and therefore a deviation of the pairing gap from the original curve is found at any density . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noticing that decreasing the @xmath18 meson mass the peak value of the energy gap shifts to slightly lower densities , because the average distance of the competition between long - range and short - range components of the interaction increases and hence the pairing peak shifts to a lower density . on the right side of the figure the deviation of </S>",
    "<S> the gap from the original value is increasing with density simply because the reduction of the @xmath18 mass also increases . </S>",
    "<S> the effects is stronger for higher scaling parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of the peak value has the same explanation as earlier .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed the influence of the short - range part of the interaction on the @xmath10 pairing gap in neutron matter . </S>",
    "<S> mechanisms which come into play at short distance , such as particle - particle ladder correlations , three - body forces , and meson masses , have been discussed in the solution of the bcs gap equation . </S>",
    "<S> these effects appear to point altogether to a reduction of the gap which seems however small compared to that effected by polarization corrections to the interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , at the present time no definite quantitative conclusions can be drawn due to too many theoretical incertainties . </S>"
