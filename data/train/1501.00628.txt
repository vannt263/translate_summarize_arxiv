    "@xmath1-body systems with long - range interactions have some peculiarities with respect to systems with short - range interactions , having drawn much attention at least along the last two decades  @xcite , and for a longer time if one considers self - gravitating systems and charged plasmas .",
    "starting from a non - equilibrium configuration , a short - range interacting system evolves to thermodynamic equilibrium in a relatively small relaxation time , while a long - range interacting system evolves over different stages characterized by time - scales differing by orders of magnitude , and taking a very long time to reach thermodynamic equilibrium for a finite number of particles .",
    "the initial stage of evolution is a violent relaxation into a quasi - stationary state ( qss ) in a time roughly independent on the number of particles  @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time to thermodynamic equilibrium diverges in the @xmath2 limit ( vlasov limit ) and gets trapped in a non - equilibrium non - gaussian stationary state .",
    "a pair interaction potential is long - ranged if it decays at long distances as @xmath3 with @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the spatial dimension and @xmath6 the inter - particle distance .",
    "this implies that all particles , no matter how far , contribute to the total energy . consequently the system is non - additive , violating the fundamental axiom of thermodynamics : non - additivity of entropy .",
    "it is worth remembering that this is not in contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics , which is always valid  @xcite .",
    "another common consequence is non - ergodicity , most extensively studied for the hamiltonian mean field model  @xcite , but also for one and three - dimensional self gravitating systems  @xcite . quite curiously , and up to the authors knowledge , no previous detailed study was devoted to the ergodicity of the two - dimensional case , at least not in the sense discussed here . in the vlasov limit ,",
    "the dynamics of the system is exactly described by the vlasov equation , which is essentially the liouville equation for the one - particle distribution function evolving in the mean - field due to all other particles , and given by  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the one - particle distribution function , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the momentum and position vectors in @xmath5 spatial dimensions , respectively , and @xmath11 is the mean field force at position @xmath10 and time @xmath12 with @xmath13 the inter - particle potential . for finite @xmath1 the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ vlasoveq ] ) does no longer vanish and is given by the pertinent collisional contributions ( granularity effects )  @xcite .",
    "for a long - range interacting system the thermodynamic limit is ill defined  @xcite , and the vlasov limit can be taken consistently by introducing a kac factor @xmath14 in the interaction potential , such that the energy becomes extensive , but still non - additive , and that the @xmath2 limit converges  @xcite .",
    "the study of ergodicity was pioneered by boltzmann in his works on the foundations on statistical mechanics  @xcite , and latter extended by birkhoff  @xcite and khinchin  @xcite .",
    "the ergodic hypothesis states that time average of a dynamical functions @xmath15 equals the ensemble average : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes a point in the system state space ( or phase space for a hamiltonian classical system ) , @xmath18 is the time average of @xmath15 , @xmath19 its ensemble average and @xmath20 a statistical measure . proving ergodicity rigorously is a difficult task and has been accomplished only for a few cases .",
    "most studies rely on different methods such as determining the existence of gaps in phase - space  @xcite , direct comparison of time and ensemble averages for the momentum variable  @xcite , sojourn time statistics for cells in phase - space  @xcite , testing for equipartition of energy  @xcite and the dynamical functional approach  @xcite .",
    "the latter can also be used to determined weather the system is mixing , which is a stronger property than ergodicity .",
    "the dynamics of a system is mixing in its phase - space @xmath21 if for an invariant measure @xmath22 , @xmath23 a map preserving @xmath22 and @xmath24 , we have that  @xcite : @xmath25 non - ergodicity can also be classified as strong if some regions of phase - space are non - accessible to the system and weak if all regions are accessible but not equally visited .",
    "ergodicity can be studied in two complementary ways .",
    "the first possibility is to consider the evolution in phase space of the @xmath1-particle system , with time averages computed over the trajectory of the point representing the state of the whole system .",
    "ensemble averages are then obtained by considering all points in the energy hypersurface as equally probable , i.  e.  for the microcanonical equilibrium .",
    "this is equivalent to state that the total time spent in a phase - space region is asymptotically proportional to its measure .",
    "the other possibility is to consider single particle histories as realizations of a stochastic process . in this case",
    "time averages are taken over one particle history , while ensemble averages are taken over the set of all @xmath1 particles .",
    "this approach is particularly suited for a direct experimental verification even for short - range interacting systems  @xcite . in this case",
    "ergodicity , i.  e.  the coincidence of the time and ensemble averages is not equivalent to thermodynamic equilibrium as will become evident below .",
    "we consider the latter case in the present work , with @xmath21 in eq .",

    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ te ] we succinctly present the methods for testing ergodicity used in the present work , and apply then to a two - dimensional hard - disc gas in section  [ sris ] , and to the hmf model in section  [ hmfrev ] .",
    "the ergodic properties of a two - dimensional self - gravitating system are discussed in section  [ tdg ] .",
    "we close the paper with some concluding remarks in section  [ cr ] .",
    "we consider the time evolution of a single particle to compute time averages while ensemble averages are obtained by taking the average over the @xmath1 particles in the whole system .",
    "for an ergodic system both quantities coincide .",
    "let us then consider the momentum @xmath32 of particle @xmath28 and its position @xmath33 at time @xmath12 and write their time averages as : @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , where @xmath36 is a constant time interval , that we take as being the numeric integration time step and @xmath37 is the total number of such intervals . the time averages are computed up to a given time @xmath12 denoted by the argument of @xmath38 and @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",

    "we discussed the ergodic and mixing properties of a two - dimensional self - gravitating system using the methods described in section  [ te ] .",
    "the potential of the system is regularized by the kac factor in order to have a well defined thermodynamic ( or vlasov ) limit . in order to better understand our results we also applied the same tests to a gas of two - dimensional hard - discs , and to the hmf model .",
    "we showed that all these models are ergodic and mixing , although for the hmf model this is true only if @xmath1 is finite , as the observation time required for the system to be ergodic ( and mixing ) diverges with @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , for two - dimensional gravity , this time scale seems to be independent on @xmath1 .",
    "this is related to the confining nature of the interaction potential and the scaling of fluctuations of the force around its mean - field value on @xmath1 .",
    "if a kac factor is not introduced in the potential , then the time for ergodicity diverges with increasing @xmath1 . for the hard - disc gas ,",
    "the time for ergodicity goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit , at variance with both long - range interacting systems studied here .",
    "the direct and dynamical functional methods proved to be relevant tools for testing ergodicity for the self - gravitating system , while the sojourn times approach gave more ambiguous results , as the tail of their distribution is too short in the present case to asses if there is an algebraic part .",
    "we note that up to the authors knowledge , the only previous study where such characteristic time was estimated for long - range interacting systems were devoted to the hamiltonian mean field model , where a @xmath1 dependence was reported  @xcite .",
    "this result is reobtained here for an equilibrium initial condition .",
    "we also point out that a self - gravitating system with @xmath2 is weakly non - ergodic since in the one - particle phase space the constant energy hypersurface is always connected , and all regions are necessarily accessible by the dynamics . in this way ,",
    "a mean - field system can strongly non - ergodic if the corresponding energy hypersurface can be composed , at least for some energy values , by disjoint sets .",
