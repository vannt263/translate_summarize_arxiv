    "21  cm hi line observations over the years have provided critical understanding of the nature of galaxies and the processes which govern their evolution .",
    "hi line studies address a host of fundamental cosmological questions ( the number density , distribution and nature of optically  dark and low mass halos ) and issues of galaxy formation and evolution ( sizes of hi disks , history of tidal interactions and mergers , low z absorber cross section , origin of dwarf galaxies , nature of high velocity clouds ) .",
    "the program for the current symposium _",
    "`` frontiers of astrophysics '' _ , marking the 50th anniversary of nrao , illustrates the continued promise of hi line investigations not only for the exploration of galaxies and large scale structure but also for new applications which will explore entirely uncharted cosmic volumes , the `` dark ages '' .",
    "surveys of redshifted hi for cosmological purposes are main drivers of the square kilometer array ( ska ) .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that , in comparison with the view gleaned from optical redshift catalogs , our understanding of @xmath4 cosmology through the eyes of the 21  cm line is still immature . the hi equivalent of the optical luminosity function ( olf ) , the hi mass function ( himf ) ,",
    "is still derived from only a few thousand objects . among recent estimates of the himf are those presented by zwaan _",
    "et al _ ( 1997 ) , rosenberg & schneider ( 2002 ) , zwaan _ et al _ ( 2003 ) and springob _ et al _ ( 2005 ) .",
    "the latter is based on a compilation of hi observations of @xmath09000 optically selected galaxies , further restricted by hi line flux and optical diameter to a complete subsample containing 2200 objects .",
    "the other determinations are based on blind hi surveys and thus have no bias against the low luminosity and low surface brightness galaxies which may be underrepresented in optical galaxy catalogs .",
    "however , all of these studies suffer from limitations associated with small number statistics , systematics and the effects of cosmic variance , especially at both the low and high mass ends .",
    "of particular note , the lowest mass objects are detected only very nearby ; determination of the low mass hifm slope is not only limited by small number statistics but also by large uncertainties in the hi masses derived using redshift distances ( masters , haynes & giovanelli 2004 ) . because of volume limitations , the high mass end is likewise poorly sampled . since the most massive objects will be the hi lampposts detected at high redshift in large numbers by the ska and its precursor instruments , it is critical to understand the nature and distribution of their local counterparts .    here ,",
    "i introduce and review the promise of the on - going arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey to yield cosmologically significant results on the number and distribution of optically - dark and low mass halos and on the determination of the @xmath5 himf , the hi correlation function and its bias parameter .",
    "just as the introduction of wide field ccds revolutionized the survey capabilities of optical and infrared telescopes , hi line astronomy is undergoing a similar renaissance with the advent of multi - beam receivers on the large single - dish telescopes , enabling blind hi surveys that cover wide areas .",
    "table [ tab : haynes_tab1 ] summarizes the principal characteristics of major blind hi surveys .",
    "most recently , the 305  m antenna has been equipped with a 7-beam system known as alfa , the arecibo l - band feed array , which is being used to conduct wide area surveys in galactic , extragalactic and pulsar research .",
    "the local extragalactic sky visible to arecibo is rich , containing the central longitudes of the supergalactic plane in and around the virgo cluster , the main ridge of the pisces  perseus supercluster , and the extensive filaments connecting a1367 , coma and hercules . included in table [ tab : haynes_tab1 ] are two surveys currently exploiting alfa , namely alfalfa and a somewhat deeper targeted survey covering a much smaller area , the arecibo galaxy environments survey ( ages ; auld _ et al _ 2006 ) .    ccrccrrc survey & beam & area & @xmath6 & rms@xmath7 & v@xmath8 & n@xmath9 & ref + & ( @xmath10 ) & ( @xmath11 ) & ( km  s@xmath12 ) & ( @xmath7 ) & ( km  s@xmath12 ) & & + ahiss & 3.3 & 13 & 16 & 0.7 & 4800 & 65 & @xmath13 + adbs & 3.3 & 430 & 34 & 3.3 & 3300 & 265 & @xmath14 + wsrt & 49 .",

    ", alfalfa is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the hi mass function , a goal for which sky coverage is critical ( giovanelli _ et al _ 2005a ) .",
    "it exploits a `` minimum intrusion '' technique designed to maximize data quality ( giovanelli _ et al _ 2005b ) and an automated fourier domain signal extraction algorithm ( saintonge 2007 ) .",
    "alfalfa has @xmath30 the sensitivity , @xmath31 the angular resolution , @xmath32 the spectral resolution , and @xmath33 the total bandwidth of hipass , the hi parkes all - sky survey ( zwaan _ et al _ 2004 ; meyer _ et al _ 2004 ) . with a median redshift of only @xmath02800 km  s@xmath12 , hipass did not sample adequate extragalactic volume to yield a cosmologically `` fair sample '' . furthermore ,",
    "the large beamsize ( 15 ) of the parkes telescope made identification of optical counterparts often uncertain without followup hi synthesis observations ( oosterloo _ et al _ 2007 ) .",
    "the centroiding accuracy of alfalfa is on average 24   ( 20   median ) for all sources with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath34 so that identification of the most probably stellar counterpart is an integral part of the alfalfa cataloging process .",
    "its median redshift is @xmath07800 km  s@xmath12 , nearly @xmath32 that of hipass .",
    "initial results from alfalfa precursor observations were published by giovanelli _",
    "( 2005b ) , and two catalogs of hi detections from the survey itself are published ( giovanelli _ et al _ 2007 ) or submitted ( saintonge _ et al _ 2007 ) .",

    "the first catalog ( giovanelli _ et al _ 2007 ) covering @xmath35 r.a .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 decl .",
    "@xmath38 , contains 730 hi detections and their most probable optical counterparts . in comparison ,",
    "hipass detected only 40 hi sources in the same region , two of which are unconfirmed by alfalfa .",
    "although this region of the sky has been heavily surveyed by previous targeted observations based on optical flux or size limited samples , 69% of the extracted sources are newly reported hi detections , an indication that previous criteria for identifying potentially hi  rich targets have neglected most of the hi - rich population .    at the time of this meeting",
    ", signal extraction has been completed for @xmath015% of the survey area with catalogs totaling @xmath04500 detections in preparation for publication in the second half of 2007 .",
    "the largest contiguous region fully processed to date corresponds to a strip between 7.5@xmath39 r.a .",
    "@xmath40 , 12@xmath41 decl .",
    "a total of 2657 hi sources have been detected in that region which covers @xmath07.5% of the survey total solid angle .",
    "figure [ fig : haynesfig1 ] shows a cone diagram of the alfalfa detections in this strip ; the distribution of hi sources closely matches the complex features of large scale structure evident also from optical surveys .",
    "figure [ fig : haynesfig2 ] summarizes the characteristics of the hi detections in the same region .",
    "the statistical improvement of alfalfa over hipass is clear from the sp \" anhauer diagram shown on the left ; in fact , in the same region , hipass detected only 90 sources versus the 2700 found by alfalfa .",
    "the diagrams on the right show the quality of the alfalfa data and signal extraction technique : the s / n of detections exhibits no significant bias with respect to velocity width .",
    "spectroscopic hi surveys are not simply flux limited ; the flux limit is expected to increase as @xmath43 for low velocity widths and show a linear rise for the wider line profiles .",
    "such a transition is observed near @xmath44 .",
    "the alfalfa flux limit is @xmath45 jy  km  s@xmath12 for narrow lines , rising to 1 jy  km  s@xmath12 for the broadest ones .",
    "the detection areal density of @xmath05 sources deg@xmath46 , with peaks @xmath47 higher in regions of groups and clusters suggests that the full alfalfa survey may catalog as many as 30,000 hi sources , a higher yield than suggested by survey simulations based on estimates of the himf derived from previous surveys ( giovanelli _ et al _ 2005a ) .",
    "a truly `` dark galaxy '' is a halo consisting only of dark matter . in some scenarios ,",
    "it is possible that some optically dark objects may contain enough hi that a blind hi survey would detect them .",
    "a good example of a `` dark '' object is the southwestern component of the binary system known as hi1225 + 01 .",
    "while the northeastern hi component hosts a small , star forming dwarf , the sw component has no detectable stellar counterpart .",
    "vla observations reveal a velocity field implying rotation with @xmath48 km  s@xmath12 , yielding a dynamical mass of @xmath49 m@xmath50 and thus @xmath51 ( chengalur , giovanelli & haynes 1995 ) . however , it is not an isolated object , being part of an apparent binary system .",
    "a candidate isolated massive dark galaxy virgohi21 , was detected by davies _",
    "et al _ ( 2004 ) during the hi jodrell all - sky survey ( hijass ) and corroborated by arecibo and wsrt observations ( minchin _ et al _ 2007 ) .",
    "virgohi21 lies some 100 kpc n of ngc  4254 , m99 , one of the brightest spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "well - known for its prominent optical lopsidedness and strong @xmath52 spiral mode , ngc  4254 lies about 3@xmath53 , or 1 mpc at the virgo distance , from m87 and appears to be moving at high speed relative to the cluster .",
    "it is , however , not hi deficient . as illustrated in figure",
    "[ fig : haynesfig3 ] , the alfalfa observations reported by haynes _ et al _ ( 2007 ) show clearly the existence of a huge hi stream , in which virgohi21 is one condensation , extending @xmath0 250 kpc to the north of ngc  4254 .",
    "the gas mass associated with the stream is a modest @xmath54 @xmath55 , or about 10% of the total hi associated with ngc  4254 .",
    "one of the driving arguments for the interpretation of virgohi21 as an isolated massive dark galaxy is the gradient seen in the velocity field ( minchin _ et al _ 2007 ) ; as evident in figure [ fig : haynesfig3 ] , this gradient is just part of the varying , large  scale velocity field along the stream .",
    "duc & bournaud ( 2007 ) have modeled the formation of a tidal tail closely resembling that seen in figure [ fig : haynesfig3 ] by a a very high speed encounter of ngc  4254 with another cluster member now located several degrees away .",
    "alfalfa has discovered a number of other optically - dark hi clouds in the periphery of virgo ( kent _ et al _ 2007 ; kent , this volume ) which may be of similar origin .",
    "one of the principal results of hipass is the lack of hi detections without optical counterparts in those regions of the sky not obscured by the galactic plane .",
    "alfalfa will deliver much more stringent constraints on the existence of gas - rich dark galaxies through its sensitive , large volume coverage .",
    "one of the principal discrepancies between cold dark matter theory and current observations revolves around the large difference between the number of dwarf dark matter halos seen around giant halos in numerical simulations based on cdm and the observed dwarf satellite population in the local group ( kauffmann _ et al _ 1993 ; klypin _ et al _ 1999 ) , referred to as the `` missing satellite problem '' .",
    "previous determinations of the himf below 10@xmath56 @xmath55 ( zwaan _ et al _  1997 ; rosenberg & schneider 2002 ; zwaan _ et al _ 2003 ) suffer severely from small number statistics and from the systematics associated with distance uncertainties and large scale inhomogeneities ( masters , haynes & giovanelli 2004 ) .",
    "alfalfa is specifically designed to survey enough solid angle to detect several hundred objects with @xmath57 @xmath58 and thus provide a robust determination of the low hi mass slope of the himf .",
    "already , alfalfa has detected more galaxies with masses less than @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath55 than included in all of the previous hi blind surveys combined .",
    "for her ph.d .",
    "thesis , amlie saintonge ( 2007b ) has undertaken a first study of some of the lowest hi mass galaxies detected early in the alfalfa survey .",
    "all of them are nearby , optically faint and of low surface brightness .",
    "they exhibit a range of morphological clumpiness and rates of massive star formation .",
    "various members of the alfalfa consortium are pursuing multiwavelength observations including broad - band and h@xmath59 imaging , hi synthesis mapping and uv imaging with the galex satellite .",
    "of a first sample targeted for follow - up h@xmath59 imaging , 15% do not show the presence of hii regions . while this work is still on - going",
    ", we present an illustrative example of the kind of newly catalogued system that alfalfa finds .",
    "figure [ fig : haynesfig4 ] shows the alfalfa hi spectrum of a new dwarf member of the ngc  672 group dubbed agc  112521 .",
    "this object was first detected in our alfa - commissioning precursor observations ( giovanelli _ et al _ 2005b ) and recovered in the early alfalfa survey observations .",
    "as evident in figure [ fig : haynesfig4 ] , the hi line emission from the galaxy is clearly detected at c@xmath60 km  s@xmath12 , a narrow line full width at 50% of the peak emission of 26 km  s@xmath12 and a total hi line flux density of 0.68 jy - km  s@xmath12 ( saintonge _ et al _ 2007 ) .",
    "assuming its membership in the ngc  672 group at a distance of 7.2 mpc , the hi mass is @xmath61 @xmath55 .",
    "its blue luminosity l@xmath62 derived from newly acquired images is similarly low : l@xmath63 @xmath64 , so that @xmath57/l@xmath62 is 2.2 . adopting standard relations to convert multiband magnitudes into stellar mass",
    ", we find that nearly half of the baryonic matter is still in the form of gas .    with the promise of a final catalog of thousands of galaxies in the mass range @xmath65 @xmath57 @xmath66 @xmath55 , the study of these gas rich systems is a prime science driver of alfalfa .",
    "future alfalfa studies will explore not only the low mass slope of the hi mass function and its possible dependence on environment , but also the distribution , morphology , star formation rate and chemical enrichment history of these low mass gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "as pointed out by peebles ( 2001 ) , numerical simulations based on cdm predict that voids should contain large numbers of dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , the voids in the simulations of gottlber _ et al _ ( 2003 ) are criss - crossed by dark matter filaments within which lie large numbers of very low amplitude inhomogeneities .",
    "in fact , those authors predict that a void with a diameter of 20@xmath67 mpc should contain 1000 dark matter halos with masses of 10@xmath68 @xmath55 , and as many as 50 with masses ten times greater than that .",
    "peebles suggests that the failure to identify such a void population raises one of the principal challenges to cdm models .",
    "photoionization and baryonic blowout may suppress star formation or perhaps the retention of any baryons within the low mass halos , but it still is not clear that these processes are sufficient to explain the absence of galaxies in voids ( hoeft _ et al _  2006 ) .",
    "limits on the abundance and properties of void galaxies have been placed by previous optical and radio studies .",
    "( 2005 ) have used the sdss dataset to show that the olf of void galaxies has a fainter break luminosity l@xmath69 but a similar faint end slope to the overall sdss luminosity function .",
    "in addition , they have shown that void galaxies are typically blue , disk - like and have high h@xmath59 equivalent widths , making them excellent targets for hi emission line surveys .",
    "previous surveys for hi in voids have exploited the vla to conduct blind hi surveys of the pisces - supercluster and its foreground void ( weinberg _ et al _ 1991 ; szomoru _ et al _ 1994 ) and the bootes void ( szomoru _ et al _ 1993 ; 1996 ) .",
    "et al _ ( 1993 ) did find an isolated galaxy in bootes , but its mass of @xmath70 @xmath55 and blue luminosity l@xmath62 of @xmath71 exclude it as a true dwarf .",
    "in fact , those vla surveys sampled a relatively small volume and were hampered by poor spectral resolution ( 42 km  s@xmath12 ) , not adequate to detect the lowest mass , narrowest hi signals .",
    "saintonge _ et al _ ( 2007 ) initiated a first , but limited , alfalfa analysis of galaxies in the void in front of the pisces - perseus supercluster at @xmath72 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "they detected no galaxies in a large volume of 460 mpc@xmath73 , whereas a scaling of the predictions of gottlber _ et al _",
    "( 2003 ) under the assumption that the dark - to - hi mass ratio is 10:1 predicts that alfalfa would have detected 38 hi sources .",
    "this very preliminary result for a single void in only 2% of the alfalfa survey suggests that the discrepancy between the predicted and observed abundance of dwarf galaxies in voids can not be reconciled by a population of gas rich dwarfs .",
    "more credible results will be available when the full alfalfa survey is completed .",
    "although they acknowledge the volume and resolution limitations of the hipass catalog , recent papers have explored the behavior of the galaxy distribution it traces by attempting to estimate its two  point correlation function @xmath74 .",
    "et al _ ( 2007 ) conclude that gas - rich galaxies are among the most weakly clustered galaxies known and suggest that the clustering scale length @xmath75 depends strongly on rotational velocity , and thus , by implication , on the halo mass .",
    "in contrast , basilakos _ et al _ ( 2007 ) argue that massive hipass galaxies show the same clustering properties as optically - selected ones , but that the low mass systems , @xmath57 @xmath76 @xmath55 , show a nearly uniform distribution .",
    "both of these studies are fraught with potential systematics because of the shallow depth of hipass , the potential impact of source confusion and the statistical limitations when its catalog is divided into subsets . as the follow - on to hipass",
    ", alfalfa is specifically designed to overcome many of the limitations of the earlier survey , thereby allowing a robust determination of the hi - hi and hi - optical galaxy correlation functions and a quantitative study of the biasing of the hi population relative to optical or ir - selected samples and to the underlying density field .",
    "one of the prime science drivers of the ska is the undertaking of a billion galaxy redshift survey in the hi line over the redshift range @xmath77 to explore the evolution of the gas content of galaxies and constrain the dark energy equation of state through the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( abdalla & rawlings 2004 ) .",
    "even allowing for the likely increase in the gas content with @xmath78 , only the most massive hi galaxies will be detected in emission at moderate redshift .",
    "as in the case of the low mass end of the himf , previous surveys have been too shallow to detect the most massive hi galaxies .",
    "alfalfa has already detected more than twice as many massive galaxies with @xmath57 @xmath79 @xmath55 than all the previous hi blind surveys combined .",
    "these massive galaxies exhibit a range of morphologies , colors and nuclear concentration but all appear to be luminous disk systems .",
    "many have stellar masses in the range corresponding to the `` transition mass '' ( @xmath80 @xmath55 ) above which galaxies show a marked decrease in their present- to past - averaged star formation rates ( kauffmann _ et al _  2003 ) .",
    "alfalfa will contribute its high mass detections to the galex  arecibo ",
    "sdss survey ( gass ; p.i .",
    ": d. schiminovich ) , a new program to obtain measures of the hi content at a gas mass fraction as low as 1.5% of the stellar mass in a sample of 1000 galaxies chosen by optical - uv criteria to have stellar masses @xmath81 @xmath55 .",
    "the combination of multiwavelength data will provide new understanding of the physical processes that regulate gas accretion and its conversion into stars in massive systems . while alfalfa@xmath82gass will characterize the properties of galaxies at @xmath83 , ambitious future studies aimed at characterizing the evolution of galaxies over the last 4 gyr",
    "should be possible in the next few years with arecibo as well as the ska precursor instruments .",
    "alfalfa is an ongoing survey with a detection catalog available in mid-2007 reflecting only about 15% of the final survey .",
    "given its state , the full impact of alfalfa is only beginning to become evident , but the survey promises now to yield @xmath84 extragalactic hi detections when it is complete .",
    "it should yield robust measures of the himf , the hi - hi and hi - optical correlation functions and their bias parameters at @xmath5 , thereby establishing the present day constraints on hi cosmology .",
    "the alfalfa team is an open consortium and interested parties are invited to follow the survey s progress via the alfalfa website _ http://egg.astro.cornell.edu / alfalfa_.    this work has been supported by nsf grants ast0307661 , ast0435697 and ast0607007 and by the brinson foundation .",
    "the arecibo observatory is part of the national astronomy and ionosphere center which is operated by cornell university under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
