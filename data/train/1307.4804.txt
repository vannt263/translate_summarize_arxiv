    "global interactions in a system occur when all its elements are subject to a common influence or field .",
    "global interactions appear naturally in the description of many physical , biological and social systems , such as coupled oscillators @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , charge density waves @xcite , multimode lasers @xcite , parallel electric circuits , neural dynamics , ecological systems , evolution models @xcite , economic exchange @xcite , social networks @xcite , mass media models @xcite , cross - cultural interactions @xcite , etc .",
    "a global interaction field may consist of an external environment acting on the elements , as in a driven dynamical system ; or it may originate from the interactions between the elements , in which case , we talk of autonomous dynamical systems . in many cases ,",
    "global interaction fields coexist with local or short - range interactions .",
    "although systems with global interactions possess a simple topological connectivity structure a fully connected network , they can exhibit a variety of collective behaviors , such as chaos synchronization , dynamical clusters , nontrivial collective behavior , chaotic itineracy @xcite , quorum sensing @xcite , etc .",
    "these behaviors have been studied in models of globally coupled maps @xcite and have been experimentally investigated in globally coupled oscillators in chemical , physical and biological systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , chaos synchronization is a fundamental phenomenon in dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "its investigation has provided insights into many natural processes and motivation for practical applications such as secure communications and control of nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "complete synchronization in a system of dynamical elements subject to a global interaction field , either external or autonomous , occurs when the state variables of all the elements and the global field converge to a single orbit in phase space .",
    "generalized chaos synchronization , originally discovered in driven chaotic systems , arises when all the state variables of the elements in the system get synchronized into an orbit that is different from that of the drive @xcite .",
    "the concept of generalized synchronization of chaos has also been extended to the context of autonomous systems @xcite .",
    "this means that the chaotic state variables in a dynamical system can synchronize to each other but not to a coupling function containing information from those variables .",
    "the occurrence of both forms of chaos synchronization in driven and in autonomous systems with global interactions suggests that the nature , either external or endogenous , of the global field acting on the elements in a system is irrelevant . at the local level , each element in the system is subject to a field that eventually induces some form of synchronization between that field and the element .",
    "in general , the local dynamics in systems with global interactions can be seen as a single drive - response system @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the time evolution of an external global field acting on a system is identical to that of an autonomous global field acting on a replica system , the corresponding local drive - response dynamics in both systems should be indistinguishable , and therefore the corresponding synchronized states are equivalent ; i. e. , they occur for the same parameter values in both systems @xcite .    in many systems it is important not only to detect synchronized or other collective states , but also to understand the relationships between global and local scales that lead to such behaviors .",
    "for example , it has recently been argued that top - down causation where information flows from higher levels to lower levels in complex systems may be a major contributor to evolutionary transitions and to the emergence of behaviors in living systems @xcite , and synchronization in neural systems has been described as a top - down information processing driven by a stimulus @xcite .",
    "the above results suggest that the emergence of collective behaviors , such as a synchronized state , in a system is associated with the reception by its elements of some amount of information provided by a source , either external or endogenous to the system . in this article",
    "we investigate the relationship between information flow between the global and local variables , and the emergence of complete and generalized synchronization of chaos in dynamical networks with global interactions of different types .",
    "we employ information measures @xcite that have been widely applied to quantify drive - response causal relationships between subsystems and interdependences between data sets in many fields of science , including linguistics @xcite , electroencephalographic signals @xcite , neuroscience @xcite , communication systems @xcite , dynamical systems @xcite , and climate networks @xcite .",
    "we show that these information measures can characterize complete and generalized synchronized states and also allow us to discern the origin , either external or endogenous , of a global interaction field .",
    "a given synchronization state emerges when a sufficient amount of the information transmitted by a field is shared by all the elements in the system , on the average over long times .",
    "thus , the maximum value of the top - down information transfer can be employed as a predictor of synchronization as a parameter in the system , such as the coupling strength to the field , is varied .    in sec .",

    "this amount is characterized by the maximum value of the information transfer @xmath74 previous to the critical values of parameters for either complete or generalized synchronization .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath74 could be employed to anticipate the occurrence of a state of synchronization in the space of parameters of a system possessing a global interaction field .",
    "furthermore , the form in which information flows from macroscopic to microscopic scales for the emergence of synchronization , as measured by the quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 , differs between a driven and an autonomous system with global interactions , even if they have similar functional forms for their local dynamics or for their global fields . in summary",
    ", we have found that ( i ) near the onset of complete synchronization when a parameter is varied , the maximum of the information transfer @xmath74 for a driven system is greater than that for an autonomous system ; ( ii ) near the onset of generalized synchronization , the normalized mutual information @xmath73 and @xmath74 exhibit sharp changes for an autonomous system , while these quantities exhibit a smooth behavior for a driven system ; and ( iii ) in a state of generalized synchronization , @xmath74 is greater for a driven system than for an autonomous system and @xmath73 is smaller for a driven system than for an autonomous system .",
    "our results suggest that these information measures could be used to characterize , and possibly also to predict , other forms of collective behaviors observed in dynamical systems having global interactions .",
    "further extensions of this work include the investigation of the relationship between top - down information flow between global and local scales , and the emergence of collective behaviors and structures in more complex dynamical networks .",
