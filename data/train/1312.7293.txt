    "asymptotic properties of eigenvalues belong among the most often studied problems in the spectral theory . in this paper",
    "we are going to discuss an asymptotics of the `` attractive '' robin problem for the laplacian in a bounded domain of @xmath0 in the situation when the parameter @xmath1 in the boundary condition assumes large values .",
    "the problem has a physical motivation ; it naturally arises in the study of reaction - diffusion equation where a distributed absorbtion competes with a boundary source ",
    "see @xcite , @xcite for details . at the same the question is of mathematical interest . in a recent paper , levitin and parnovski",
    "@xcite investigated the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue and showed that its leading term is @xmath2 where @xmath3 if the domain boundary is smooth and @xmath4 if it has angles . the same one - term asymptotics is known to hold in the former case also for higher eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "a related asymptotic problem is encountered in the theory of leaky quantum graphs @xcite where the dynamics is not constrained to a bounded region , instead it is governed by a singular schrdinger operator with an attractive interaction supported by a manifold or complex of a lower dimension .",
    "a particularly close analogy occurs in the two - dimensional situation when the interaction support is closed smooth loop ; using a combination of bracketing and estimates with separated variables , one is able to derive an asymptotic expansion of negative eigenvalues @xcite in which the absolute term with respect to the coupling parameter is given by a one - dimensional schrdinger operator with a potential determined by the geometry of the problem , specifically the curvature of the loop .",
    "this inspires the question whether the technique used for the singular schrdinger operators can not be used also for robin `` billiards '' with a smooth boundary .",
    "this is the main topic of the present paper .",
    "we are going to show first that in distinction to the schrdinger case the method of @xcite does not yield an asymptotic expansion , but two - sided asymptotic estimates only , which squeeze only when the domain is a circular disc . on the other hand ,",
    "these estimates hold true not only for the principal eigenvalue , and moreover , they have three terms in the powers of @xmath1 which improves , in particular , the result obtained in @xcite for smooth boundaries . on the other hand ,",
    "the result admits an improvement . replacing the upper bound by a variational estimate similar to that employed recently by pankrashkin @xcite for the principal eigenvalue",
    ", we obtain a bound in which only the maximum of the boundary curvature appears , and as a result , a two - term asymptotic expansion .",
    "let us now state the problem properly .",
    "we suppose that @xmath5 be an open , simply connected set in @xmath6 with a closed @xmath7 jordan boundary @xmath8\\ni s\\mapsto ( \\gamma_1,\\gamma_2)\\in\\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] which is parametrized by its arc length ; for definiteness we choose the clockwise orientation of the boundary .",
    "let @xmath9\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}$ ] be the signed curvature of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "we investigate the spectral boundary - value problem @xmath12 & & \\label{problem } \\\\ [ -.5em ] \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial n}=\\beta f\\ ; & \\textrm{on } & \\gamma \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a parameter @xmath13 which will be in the following assumed to be large ; the symbol @xmath14 in ( [ problem ] ) denotes the outward normal derivative .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the quadratic form @xmath15 = \\|\\nabla f\\|^2_{l^2(\\omega)}-\\beta\\int\\limits_{\\gamma}|f(x)|^2{\\mathrm{d}}s\\ ] ] with @xmath16 is closed and below bounded ; we denote by @xmath17 the unique self - adjoint operator associated with it .",
    "our main goal is to study the asymptotic behavior of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath17 as parameter @xmath1 tends to infinity . to state the result ,",
    "we introduce the one - dimensional schrdinger operator @xmath18 with the domain @xmath19 we use the symbol @xmath20 for the @xmath21-th eigenvalue of @xmath22 counted with the multiplicity , @xmath23 , and furthermore , we denote @xmath24}\\gamma(s)$ ] and @xmath25}\\gamma(s).$ ]    our main result reads then as follows .    [ main theorem ] under the stated assumptions , to any fixed integer @xmath26 there exists a @xmath27 such that the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath17 is not smaller than  @xmath28 for @xmath29 we denote by @xmath30 the @xmath26-th eigenvalue of @xmath17 counted with the multiplicity . then @xmath30 satisfies for @xmath31",
    "the asymptotic estimates @xmath32    \\(a ) it will be clear from the proof that the assumption about simple connectedness of @xmath5 is done mostly for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the result extends easily to multiply connected domains , in general with different parameters at different components of the boundary ; each of the components then gives rise to a series of negative eigenvalues tending to @xmath33 in the limit .",
    "\\(b ) in the light of the following result the upper bound in is not of much use",
    ". we include it primarily to illustrate the significant difference between the `` two - sided '' situation discussed in @xcite and the `` one - sided '' one treated here .",
    "as we have indicated , the upper bound can be improved :    [ thm : better upper ] in the asymptotic regime @xmath34 the inequality @xmath35 is valid for any fixed @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath21-th eigenvalue behaves asymptotically as @xmath36    thus we obtain a two - term asymptotics which , in contrast to the schrdinger operator case treated in @xcite , is not precise enough to distinguish between individual eigenvalues whose mutual distances are expected to be of order of @xmath37 .",
    "let us first introduce some quadratic forms and operators which we shall need in the argument . to begin with , we need the following result , which is a straightforward modification of lemma  2.1 of @xcite , hence we skip the proof .",
    "choose an @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 , to be specified later , and let @xmath44 be the strip neighborhood of @xmath10 of width @xmath42 , @xmath45 then @xmath46 is a compact simply connected domain with the boundary @xmath47 .",
    "we define @xmath48:=\\|\\nabla f\\|^2_{\\sigma_a}-\\beta\\int\\limits_{\\gamma}|f(x)|^2{\\mathrm{d}}s\\quad\\textrm { for } \\ : f\\in\\left\\{f\\in h^1(\\sigma_a ) : f|_{\\gamma_a}=0\\right\\ } , \\\\ & & q_{a,\\beta}^n[f]:=\\|\\nabla f\\|^2_{\\sigma_a}-\\beta\\int\\limits_{\\gamma}|f(x)|^2{\\mathrm{d}}s\\quad\\textrm { for } \\ : f\\in h^1(\\sigma_a),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and denote by @xmath49 and @xmath50 the self - adjoint operators associated with the forms @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the first key component of the proof is to use the dirichlet - neumann bracketing  see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "4 )  imposing additional boundary condition at @xmath53 .",
    "this yields @xmath54 in @xmath55 where the inequality should be understood , of course , in the variational sense .",
    "since the estimating operators have the direct - sum structure and the first terms in the inequalities ( [ inequalities h_beta ] ) referring to the part of @xmath5 separated from the boundary are positive , in order to estimate the negative eigenvalues of @xmath17 it is sufficient to estimate those of @xmath56 @xmath57 .    to this aim",

    "we have @xmath127 and since @xmath128 we can claim that @xmath129 is monotonically increasing in @xmath130 and it is monotonically decreasing in @xmath131 moreover , we have @xmath132 this implies that the function @xmath129 has a unique zero in @xmath133 moreover , since @xmath134 we have @xmath135 consequently , the solution @xmath136 has the form @xmath137 @xmath138 taking into account the relation @xmath139 we get @xmath140 hence we obtain @xmath141 which concludes the proof .",
    "the operator domain in this case looks as follows , @xmath146 assume again that @xmath109 with @xmath110 is an eigenvalue of @xmath90 corresponding to a nonzero eigenfunction @xmath76 . as in the proof of lemma",
    "[ lemma t d eigenvalue ] we infer that @xmath109 is an eigenvalue of @xmath90 if and only if @xmath147 since the left - hand side of the last equation is strictly increasing , and the right - hand side is strictly decreasing for @xmath110 , then the equation ( [ equation for t n eigenvalue ] ) has a unique positive solution which lies in fact in the subinterval @xmath148    next we will show that ( [ equation for t n eigenvalue ] ) has no solutions in the interval @xmath149 suppose that the opposite is true .",
    "as @xmath150 we have @xmath151 however , since we assume @xmath152 this would imply @xmath153 on the other hand , we have @xmath154 so we come to a contradiction .",
    "hence the solution @xmath136 of ( [ equation for t n eigenvalue ] ) is of the form @xmath155 with @xmath156 and using ( [ equation for t n eigenvalue ] ) once again we get @xmath157 which further implies @xmath158 this completes the proof of lemma [ lemma t n eigenvalue ] .",
    "now we are finally in position to _ prove theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "_ we use first the bracketing to squeeze the eigenvalues in question between those of the operators . since the latter have separated variables , their eigenvalues are sums of eigenvalues of the longitudinal and transverse component which we have estimated in lemmata [ longlemma ] and [ lemma t d eigenvalue ] , [ lemma t n eigenvalue ] , respectively , and it is sufficient to choose @xmath159 to get .",
    "@xmath160    note that while the argument is pretty much the same as in the proof of theorem  1 of @xcite , with propositions 2.32.5 there replaced by the above mentioned lemmata , the result is much weaker due to the presence of the last term in the form @xmath161 and its counterpart in @xmath162 .",
    "in particular , the estimates of theorem   [ main theorem ] squeeze to produce an exact asymptotic expansion if and only if the curvature is constant , @xmath163 .",
    "let us now look at this case in more detail :    let @xmath5 be a disc of radius @xmath164 centered at the origin .",

    "the boundary condition in ( [ laplacian polar coordinates and boundary condition ] ) can be then rewritten as @xmath179 for a fixed @xmath180 . to find its solutions , let us change the variables to @xmath181 @xmath182 in which case the condition ( [ equation i_m ( 1 ) ] ) reads @xmath183 the function at the left - hand side of ( [ equation i_m ( 2 ) ] ) is strictly increasing for @xmath184 hence ( [ equation i_m ( 2 ) ] ) has a unique solution for any fixed @xmath185 and @xmath186 . as @xmath187 so does @xmath188 in ( [ equation i_m ( 2 ) ] ) , and using the well - known asymptotics of modified bessel functions , we find @xmath189 in combination with the spectral condition ( [ equation i_m ( 2 ) ] ) this yields @xmath190 this , in turn , implies the asymptotics for @xmath191 , and returning to the original variables @xmath192 we find @xmath193 this agrees , of course , with the conclusion of theorem  [ main theorem ] according to ( [ gamma explicit ] ) and ( [ mu_j explicit ] ) . at the same time it shows that there is not much room for improving the error term in the theorem , because it differs from the one in this explicitly solvable example by the logarithmic factor only .",
    "the idea is to replace the crude estimate of @xmath72 from lemma  [ l : uniteq ] by the first operator in ( [ h tilde as sum ] ) by a finer one .",
