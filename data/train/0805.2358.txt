    "in recent years , infrared space telescopes like _ iras , iso _ and especially _ spitzer _ made it possible to investigate not only the stellar content of globular clusters ( gcs ) but also their intracluster medium ( icm ) , consisting of gas and dust lost by giants .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were the first to clearly detect thermal dust emission from the core of the gc m15 ( ngc  7078 ) with _",
    "iso_. they found a dust mass an order of magnitude lower than one would expect based on the number , mass - loss rates and lifetimes of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , even at the extremely low metallicity of m15 .",
    "subsequent , more sensitive measurements with _",
    "spitzer _ resulted in a dust mass of @xmath1 indicating an accumulation time - span not much longer than @xmath2yr ( boyer et al .",
    "while such a short time is commonly explained by ram - pressure stripping during galactic plane passages , the time since the last passage for m15 is about @xmath3yr , an order of magnitude larger .",
    "therefore , additional processes have been suggested to explain short icm lifetimes , including blow - out of nova explosions , fast winds from stars , relativistic winds from millisecond pulsars ( spergel 1991 ) , and radiative ejection by the strong radiation field in m15 ( smith 1999 ) .",
    "another possibility that has not yet been investigated is related to the outcome of stellar collisions . from hydrodynamic simulations",
    "it is known that colliding main - sequence stars ( mss ) lose typically @xmath4 of their mass ( see , e.g. , lombardi et al .",
    "1996 ) . as this material",
    "is ejected with speeds typically a few times the escape speed from the stellar surface , it will transfer a significant amount of energy to the icm and possibly reduce the amount of observable dust considerably .",
    "for instance , if the gas , released through a collision between two @xmath5 msss , has a mass of @xmath6 and leaves with twice the escape velocity ( @xmath7 ) , it possesses enough kinetic energy to accelerate more than @xmath8 , the estimated total mass of icm gas in m15 ( boyer et al .  2006 ) , up to a speed of @xmath9 , the escape speed from the center of m15 .    the inferred dust lifetime in the icm",
    "would then require that such a stellar collision happens every @xmath10myr .",
    "given that m15 has a central density of @xmath11 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath12 ( see , e.g. , mcnamara et al .",
    "2004 ) , the collision time @xmath13 for a @xmath14 mss is @xmath15 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this results in at least one collision every @xmath16 for the more than @xmath17 stars in the core ( e.g. , dull et al .",
    "from this rough estimate one can already see that this mechanism is indeed promising .",
    "however , there are several factors in m15 that complicate a better estimate of the collision time .",
    "firstly , in gcs as old as m15 , all msss have masses below @xmath18 , while initially more massive stars have produced remnants like white dwarfs ( wds ) and neutron stars ( nss ) , which will have different interaction rates . secondly , because of mass segregation the lower - mass msss may concentrate in lower density regions , while more massive wds and nss concentrate near the center . finally , it is not _ a priori _ clear that enough energy from the gas ejected in a stellar collision can be effectively transferred to the icm since losses through radiative shocks may be important .    we address the issue of mass - segregation considering a specific model of m15 given in mcnamara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which is based on an @xmath0-body model of baumgardt et al .",
    "this allows us to estimate collision times involving different stellar populations in the cluster .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a minimum formation rate for blue stragglers ( bss ) through ms - ms mergers . using the number of observed bss in the core of m15 we estimate an average bs lifetime and compare it with evolutionary models , as an extra check on our basic model (  [ sec : main - sequence - collision - time ] ) . in  [ gas_icm ]",
    "we discuss how the ejected material from a stellar collision interacts with the icm and how it can clear signatures of dust emission .",
    "we conclude in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we define a collision between two stars with radii @xmath19 and @xmath20 to occur whenever their distance @xmath21 . the average local collision time @xmath22 for one star of type `` 1 '' to collide with a star of type `` 2 '' can be written as ( compare to binney & tremaine 1987 their eq .",
    "8 - 122 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number density of field stars `` 2 '' and stars of type `` 1 '' , @xmath25 their masses , and @xmath26 the one - dimensional velocity dispersion ( assuming a maxwellian velocity distribution for both species with @xmath27 ) . to get the total number of collisions per unit time in the cluster between these two species , eq .",
    "[ eq : local - coll - time ] is integrated over the whole cluster , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the radial position in the cluster .    in order to account for a continuous stellar mass spectrum and the mass - radius relationship of stars , we take local averages @xmath30 and @xmath31 at position @xmath29 .",
    "we find that in the n - body model for m15 these profiles , as well as @xmath32 , can be well represented by power - laws over a sufficiently large range of @xmath33 . inside of @xmath34",
    "there are almost no msss , while outside of @xmath35 the contribution of the integrand in eq .",
    "[ eq : totat - coll - rate ] becomes rapidly negligible .",
    "we do not consider collisions between msss and nss as the ns retention fraction in gcs is expected to be low ( pfahl & rappaport 2001 ; dull et al .",
    "we also do not consider collisions between giants and msss as the escape velocity at the surface of a giant , and even more so the expected energy of the ejected material , is an order of magnitude lower than for msss . for simplicity",
    "we choose a constant @xmath36 , as @xmath26 does not vary much within @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ; compare dull et al .",
    "1997 ) and also agrees with the value obtained by mcnamara & baumgardt ( 2004 ) for m15 for a similar region @xmath39 .",
    "the slight variations within @xmath37 are accounted for in the error estimates of the collision rates . with all quantities given as power - laws ,",
    "we solve eq .",
    "[ eq : totat - coll - rate ] analytically .",
    "our calculations are based on the results of @xmath0-body simulations by baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which were scaled to fit the velocity dispersion profile of m15 in mcnamara et al .",
    "their model consisted of initially @xmath40 stars with a realistic mass spectrum , and included a treatment of stellar evolution and the galactic tidal field .",
    "they also take into account velocity kicks imparted to nss at birth and consider two extreme cases , one where all nss are retained , and one where all nss are removed from the cluster .",
    "here we only consider the latter case , since , as mentioned before , the actual ns retention fraction is expected to be very low .    in table",
    "[ tab : parameters - fits ]    .[tab : parameters - fits]parameters of the power - law fits for the mass ( @xmath41 ) , density ( @xmath42 ) , and stellar radius ( @xmath43 ) for wds and msss .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fit parameters for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath46 and @xmath41 for wds and msss in m15 are shown . as can be seen , through mass segregation , msss",
    "are more abundant outside @xmath47 while the more massive wds dominate the central @xmath48 where collisions are most likely to happen . as a consequence",
    ", we should expect more collisions between wds and msss than between msss . from eq .",
    "[ eq : totat - coll - rate ] , we obtain @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of collisions between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it follows that , given the current state of m15 , we expect one collision every @xmath54 between a wd and a mss and every @xmath55 a collision between two msss , resulting in one collision every @xmath56 that releases high - velocity gas into the icm .",
    "it is rather remarkable how closely this timescale coincides with the estimated icm dust lifetime , suggesting a direct connection between dust clearing and stellar collisions .    using a similar approach , we estimate the bs formation rate , defining bss as two merged msss with a combined mass @xmath57 , significantly larger than the ms turn - off mass ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "after binning all msss into @xmath58 bins , we determine the collision rate between all mass bins with combined mass @xmath57 .",
    "this also allows us to determine the expected mass spectrum for bss for comparison with future observations .",
    "we obtain a total collision rate of @xmath59 which , together with the @xmath60 bss observed in m15 , implies an average bs lifetime of about @xmath61 .",
    "this is also consistent with recent bs evolution models ( e.g. , leigh et al .  2007 ; sills et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , we note that this is certainly an upper limit , given that the presence of binaries would increase the formation rate through binary mergers and resonant interactions ( fregeau et al .  2004 ;",
    "mapelli et al .  2004 ) .",
    "for example , for a plummer sphere with a kroupa mass function ranging from @xmath62 to @xmath63 and a binary fraction of @xmath64 , the rate of collisions mediated by binary - single and binary - binary interactions can be @xmath65 order of magnitude larger than from single - single interactions ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2008 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : bs_mass ]    the mass distribution for bss is shown .",
    "as expected it decreases for higher mass bss , since the number density for the lower mass msss is much higher compared to that for the close to turn - off msss .",
    "interactions between very fast moving gas and a low - density interstellar ambient medium have been extensively investigated in the context of supernova remnants .",
    "their evolution progresses in several distinct stages ( chevalier 1977 ) : the `` ejecta dominated '' ( ed ) stage , characterized by a freely expanding blast - shock wave until the mass of the swept up material is comparable to the mass of the ejecta , the `` sedov - taylor '' ( st ) stage , where the blast - wave expands adiabatically , and the `` pressure - driven snowplow '' ( pds ) stage , where a thin shell forms which `` snowplows '' through the ambient medium , driven by the pressure of the hot interior in addition to its own momentum ( cox 1972 ; cioffi et al .",
    "cioffi et al .",
    "( 1988 ) obtained a simple offset power - law solution that describes the kinematics of the blast wave in the pds stage , which can be written as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the velocity and radial position of the shock front , respectively , relative to the site of the collision , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the velocity and radial position of the shock front at the transition from the st stage to the pds stage .",
    "the transition values are given by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the kinetic energy of the ejected material in units of @xmath74 , @xmath75 the density of the ambient medium in @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the heavy element abundance relative to solar abundances .",
    "an interesting property of the flow of the post - shock gas is that in the pds stage its mean velocity has the same value as the shock speed ( cioffi et al .",
    "1988 ) . for our problem",
    "this means that , provided @xmath67 is larger than the cluster escape speed after the shock swept up all of the icm , the shocked gas can entirely escape the cluster .",
    "it is now interesting to see if such an icm removal mechanism might be applicable to m15 . for this estimate",
    "we assume an icm mass of @xmath8 , which is expected given the amount of dust detected by boyer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the low metallicity of m15 ( @xmath78 ) . in order to estimate @xmath73 for collisions between mss we can use the results of lombardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( their table 3 ) , obtaining @xmath79 .",
    "unfortunately , there are no similar results for ms  wd collisions . however , given that the mass loss is presumably between @xmath80 to @xmath81 ( ruffert & mueller 1991 ; ruffert 1992 ) and that the velocity of the ejecta should be of the order of the escape speed of the mss ( @xmath82 ) we obtain a similar range for @xmath73 .",
    "note that , although the ejecta are ejected nearly isotropically ( lombardi et al .",
    "1996 ) , the icm is likely to have a more irregular structure , as the patchy dust emission in m15 indicates .",
    "thus , only a fraction of the released energy might actually be transferred to the icm .",
    "as the 3d structure of the icm is unknown , we limit our analysis to a fiducial ejecta energy of @xmath83 but also determine the minimum @xmath73 value to remove all of the icm gas from the cluster , noting that these values are to be understood as `` effective '' energies ramming into the icm gas .",
    "similarly , estimates for the icm density are also rather uncertain .",
    "if we assume that all the gas is contained within a radius of @xmath84 ( the approximate radial position of the dust emission ) , the density of a @xmath85 gas cloud would be between @xmath86 .",
    "for simplicity , we also assume that the shock , once it leaves the st stage , remains radiative , which might not necessarily be the case for the low temperatures ( @xmath87 ) and shock speeds ( @xmath88 ) when the shock has swept up most of the icm , as cooling is less efficient in this regime ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .    using @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    "we obtain @xmath91 after the shock has swept up @xmath92 .",
    "since this velocity is lower than the escape speed of @xmath93 for m15 , it follows that the energy of the ejected material from one mss collision may not be sufficient to remove the icm completely .",
    "in fact , only for @xmath94 , which is at the upper end of the estimated ejecta energy interval , the shocked icm gas attains a velocity sufficiently large to leave the cluster .    on the other hand",
    ", the shock also heats up the gas to high temperatures , ( @xmath95 at those shock speeds ) .",
    "gas at such temperatures expands beyond a critical radius and flows out of the cluster as a wind , reducing the amounts of ionized gas down to less than @xmath96 ( knapp et al .",
    "assuming that the dust follows the gas , the dust would therefore leave the cluster on a timescale as short as @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , the wind should be even stronger in our scenario than for the static model considered in knapp et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , since here the gas itself has a considerable outwards speed through the shock .",
    "so far , we assumed the existence of rather large amounts of gas , based on the amount of observed dust and m15 s extremely low metallicity .",
    "however , searches for gas in m15 have had very limited success , and smith et al .  ( 1995 ) estimate an upper limit for the total icm mass of about @xmath98 .",
    "the reason for the much larger observed dust - to - gas ratio is not well understood ( see , e.g. , van loon et al .",
    "2006 ) . as the dust - to - gas ratio of the material lost in the winds of red giants should scale with the metallicity of the stars ( van loon et al .",
    "2005 ) , thus resulting in more than @xmath99 of gas , it appears that additional processes may be at work that remove the gas more easily than the dust .",
    "nevertheless , it is also possible that most of the icm is in molecular form as the co - to - h@xmath100 conversion factor is not known for such low metallicities and extreme radiative environments ( van loon et al .",
    "2006 ) . repeating the previous calculation for an icm mass of @xmath101 and @xmath102 accordingly ,",
    "we obtain @xmath103 for @xmath83 , while for @xmath104 @xmath105 which is close to and larger than the cluster escape speed of @xmath106 . in this case",
    ", the ejecta of one mss collision would likely be able to accelerate this gas out of the cluster .    as a final caveat ,",
    "we note that it is not very clear whether the dust will follow the rather low - density ionized gas .",
    "this strongly depends , among other quantities , on the dust grain properties and their electric potential relative to the ionized gas in a rather complicated way ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "for instance , nozawa et al .  ( 2006 ) and similarly slavin et al .  (",
    "2004 ) found in their simulations of shocks driven into dusty interstellar medium that , while small grains with sizes of @xmath107 get destroyed by sputtering and grain - grain collisions , only grains with sizes @xmath108 are actually dragged along with the gas , while grains with sizes @xmath109 remain almost unaffected and do not follow the shock wave . on the other hand ,",
    "if the size distribution of the dust grains is similar to the one for the local interstellar medium , we see ( e.g. , mathis 1996 ) that most of the dust mass is in grains with sizes of @xmath110 .",
    "this means that , even if not all dust particles follow the gas flow , we can nevertheless expect that most of the dust mass will remain sufficiently well coupled to the gas and consequently be removed .",
    "in this letter we proposed a new mechanism to explain the relatively short lifetimes of the icm dust in a dense gc , developing our arguments in detail for the case of m15 . by calculating the rate of stellar collisions using the detailed model for m15 by mcnamara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we find a remarkable , close agreement between the average time between collisions and the inferred dust lifetime of @xmath111 ( boyer et al .",
    "2006 ) in this cluster , pointing to a direct link between the two phenomena .",
    "we argue that the kinetic energy of the material ejected during a stellar collision may be sufficient to remove the dust from the cluster , depending on the assumed icm mass , either directly by accelerating dust and gas to velocities larger than the cluster escape speed , or indirectly , by accelerating and heating the gas , which then expands and leaves the cluster as a wind , carrying the dust along with it . although there are some uncertainties as to how well the dust will couple to the gas , especially at the low shock speeds expected for this problem , there are some indications from simulations of supernova remnants that might support sufficient coupling ( e.g. , nozawa et al .",
    "in addition , at least some dust grains can also be efficiently destroyed by grain - grain collisions or sputtering ( slavin et al .",
    "2004 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2006 ) , which further helps to reduce the amount of observable dust in the cluster .",
    "on the other hand , the results of these studies may not be directly applicable to our scenario because , e.g. , the intense uv field present in a cluster like m15 could strongly affect the electric potential of the grains and , therefore , their coupling to the ionized gas ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .    with a detailed model for m15",
    "we were also able to calculate the formation rate and mass distribution of bss through ms - ms collisions . by comparing with the observed number of bss in the cluster , we derive an upper limit to their average lifetime of @xmath112 , consistent with current stellar structure and evolution models for bss ( e.g. , leigh et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we conclude that the interaction of ejected gas from stellar collisions with the icm will strongly influence the observable signal of the dust in the icm , and , given the remarkable agreement between dust lifetimes and collision times in m15 , this represents a promising mechanism to explain the very short dust and icm lifetimes in gcs ."
