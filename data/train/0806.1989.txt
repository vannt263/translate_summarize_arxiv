[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab3 ]    in recent years new types of fractal membranes have been successfully developed @xcite .",
    "firstly , these fractal membranes can provide nearly total reflection for the em waves ( photon flux ) with certain frequencies in the ghz band ; at the same time , they can provide nearly total transmission for the photon fluxes with other frequencies in the ghz band ( the fractal - membrane pattern can be `` significantly sub - wavelength in all dimensions '' @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , the photon fluxes reflected and transmitted by the fractal membranes can keep their strength invariant within the distance of one meter from the fractal - membrane s surface , especially if the fractal - membrane reflectors are back - to - back very - shallow ( or segmented ) paraboloid mirrors that focus the ppf on the detectors situated out along opposite ends of the x - axis . in this case",

    "propagate along the negative and positive directions of the x - axis in the first octant ( the region of @xmath192 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath224 propagates along the direction toward the fractal membrane , while @xmath225 propagates along the direction away from the fractal membrane ( see fig 9 ) . using the reflecting fractal membranes with their plane or paraboloid faces normal to the x - axis",
    ", it will reflect only @xmath224 and not @xmath225 .",
    "once @xmath224 is reflected ( defined as @xmath226)it will have the same propagating direction as @xmath225 .",
    "however , after @xmath224 is reflected , it can keep its strength invariant within one meter distance from the fractal membrane [ 56 , 57 ] , while @xmath225 decays as the typical gaussian decay rate @xmath227[see , eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) ] to each side of the gb ( x and y directed ) , then the ratio @xmath228 ( the signal - to - background noise ratio in the x - direction ) would be larger than one in the whole region of @xmath229 ( see , table [ tab3 ] , @xmath77 is the distance from the detectors to the fractal membranes ) .",
    "table [ tab3 ] shows that the bpf @xmath225 is much larger than the ppf @xmath230 in the region @xmath231 , while the @xmath232and @xmath230have the same order of magnitude at @xmath233 , and @xmath230would be larger than @xmath225 in the region of @xmath234 .",
    "in other words , in the region the signal - to - background noise ratio @xmath235 in the x - direction might gain up to a comparable order of magnitude .",
    "it appears better to use the transmitting fractal membranes , because the ppf transmitted by the fractal membrane can also keep its strength invariant within one meter to the membrane , and the ppf does not change its propagating direction . in this case , the ppf detectors in 1st and 3rd octants in fig 9 should be replaced by the detectors in 2nd and 4th octants in fig 10 .",
    "in fact , the circular polarized `` monochromatic component '' , eq.(35 ) , is often called the right - handed circular polarization , while a left - handed circular polarized component has following form @xmath236 , \\nonumber\\\\ & & h_\\otimes = h_{12 } = h_{21 } = -ia_\\otimes \\exp \\left [ { i\\left ( { k_g z-\\omega_g t}\\right ) } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath237 . in our em system , according to eqs.(35),(38),(39 ) and ( 69 ) , the propagating direction of @xmath238 depends on the choice of circular polarization .",
    "thus , if the interacting `` monochromatic component '' is only the left - handed circular polarized state , eq.(69 ) , then the propagating direction of @xmath238 will be opposite to that generated by the right - handed circular polarized component , eq.(35 ) , and then @xmath238 and @xmath218 propagate along opposite directions in the regions of 2nd , 4th , 5th and 7th octants , while they have the same propagating direction in the regions of 1st , 3rd , 6th and 8th octants .",
    "in such a case , the distinguishable ppf from the bpf would be @xmath219 in the regions of 2nd and 4th octants but not in the regions of 1st and 3rd octants .",
    "if the both circular polarizations exist at the same time ( in this case the two polarized states often have a certain phase difference . more detailed investigation for the issues will be done elsewhere),then the ppfs ( here we defined them as @xmath239 and @xmath240 , respectively ) generated by the right- and left - handed polarized circular components will propagate along the opposite directions in the every octant .",
    "one of them propagates along the positive direction in the x - axis , and another one the negative direction in the x - axis .",
    "however , because acting effects of fractal membranes to @xmath241 and @xmath240 are quite different , one kind of the two ppfs ( @xmath239 or @xmath240 ) could be distinguished from the bpf .",
    "for example , in the first - octant ( the region of x , y , z@xmath1670 ) @xmath241 and @xmath240 propagate along the negative and positive directions in the x - axis , respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath242 propagates along the direction toward the fractal membrane , while @xmath243 and @xmath188 propagate along the direction away from the fractal membrane ( see also , figs . 1 , 9 , and 10 ) .",
    "in this case the ppf reflected ( or transmitted ) by the fractal membrane will be only @xmath242 but not @xmath243 and @xmath188 . once @xmath242 is reflected ( or",
    "transmitted ) by the fractal membrane , it will keep its strength invariant within one meter distance from the fractal membrane [ 56 , 57 ] , while @xmath188 decays as the typical gaussian decay rate exp(@xmath244 , @xmath243 decay as the exp(@xmath245 [ see also , eq.(59 ) ] .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath246 would has a comparable order of magnitude in the distance of 35cm@xmath168x@xmath16837 cm from the fractal membrane ( see also , table iii ) . in this case , in principle , @xmath242 can still be distinguished from @xmath188 , while the other one of the ppfs @xmath243 will be swamped by @xmath188 due to the same propagating direction and the similar decay way of them .",
    "there is a similar property in the second octant ( the region of x@xmath1680 , y , z@xmath1670 ) , unique difference is that where @xmath243 and @xmath188 propagate along the opposite directions , while @xmath242 and @xmath188 propagate along the same direction .",
    "thus the distinguishable ppf from the bpf would be only @xmath243 but not @xmath242 . utilizing",
    "the similar means it can be shown that in the 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 4th octants , the distinguishable ppf from the bpf will be one kind of the ppfs , namely , @xmath242 or @xmath243 .",
    "consequently , role of the fractal membranes looks like a  one - way valve \" with strong focusing function to the photon flux in the ghz band .",
    "this property will be very useful to distinction and displaying the ppfs generated by the stochastic hfrgw background .",
    "of course , if considering other possible noise sources and diffraction effects , the values listed in table [ tab1 ] will be further reduced , thus an obvious gap still exists between the theoretical schemes and reality .",
    "at the moment there are no operating prototypes of the em detecting system , although relevant researches and construction of the em detecting system are already in progress , it is difficult to give a complete description for the noise issues .",
    "however , since our purpose is display and detection of the ppf of about @xmath247=5ghz in the terminal microwave receiver , our attention will be focused into two key aspects :    ( 1 ) .",
    "what are strength and physical behavior of the ppf ( signal ) and the bpf ( background ) reaching the microwave receiver ;    ( 2 ) . how to distinguish the ppf and other photons caused by noise , such as the thermal noise , background noise and external em noise .",
    "here we shall give a very brief and rough review .",
    "except for the background photon noise issue just mentioned , there are the thermal noise sources and possible external em noise sources . because the frequency of the ppf ( signal ) is roughly @xmath248 , if the system is cooled down to @xmath249 ( @xmath250 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath251 , i.e. , @xmath252 , then the frequency @xmath253 of the thermal photons will be less than the @xmath254 of the ppf . if the apparatus is kept to a lower temperature , e.g. , _",
    "t @xmath255 or @xmath256 _",
    "( this is well within the current technology ) , then we have @xmath257 .",
    "thus the difference in the frequency band for such two kinds of photons would be very great , i.e. , the signal photon flux and the thermal photons can be easily distinguished .",
    "in other words , practically speaking there are no thermal photons at @xmath258 , and in this way the thermal noise can be suppressed as long as the em detector can select the correct frequency .",
    "note that the low temperature is very convenient for the operation of the superconductors and the strong static magnetic field .    for the possible external em noise sources , using a faraday cage or shielding covers made from such fractal membranes @xcite , or from a tight mosaic of superconductor chips on the inside surface of the detector s cryogenic containment vessel",
    ", would be very effective .",
    "moreover , a good `` microwave darkroom '' can provide an effective shielding environment , and in this case possible dielectric dissipation ( using a vacuum operation ) can be effectively suppressed . in this case one would obtain a suitable environment for a measurable signal - to - noise ratio .    also , the superposition of the relic gw stochastic components will cause the fluctuation of the ppfs , even if such `` monochromatic components '' all satisfy the frequency resonant condition ( @xmath47",
    ". however , eqs .",
    "( [ eq50 ] ) , ( [ eq52 ] ) , ( [ eq55 ] ) , ( [ eq58 ] ) and ( [ eq59 ] ) show that the metric perturbation only influences the strength fluctuation of the ppfs and does not influence the `` direction resonance . ''",
    "that is , it does not influence the selection capability of the em system to the propagating directions of the relic gws , and it does not influence average effect over time of the ppfs .",
    "in addition , the values of the ppfs discussed in the present paper depend on the strength of the hfrgws in the ghz band expected by the qim and other relevant string cosmology scenarios ( e.g. , see refs , @xcite ) .",
    "because such models and scenarios are somewhat controversial , we can not know in advance how accurate these models and scenarios might be .",
    "if the strength of the real hfrgws in the ghz band are much less than the magnitude expected by such models and scenarios , even if the required conditions can be satisfied and one might still not be able to detect and measure such hfrgws , then the hfrgw models will be corrected . thus , this scheme might provide an indirect way to test such models and scenarios , that is , as suggested by brustein et al .",
    "@xcite , a null experiment would be valuable . in any event ,",
    "the hfgw generator and detector experiment described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which operate at about the same frequencies as the hfrgws , will prove the concept of the present detector independently from cosmological experiments .    moreover , there are some issues and problems need further investigation . for example , how to generate a typical and high - quality gb , how to suppress distortion of the spot radius of the gb and align it , what is concrete correction to the ppf caused the higher order modes of the gb , how to further estimate and analysis the relevant noise sources , what are concrete influence and correction of the fractal membranes ( or plates ) to the gb itself , how to estimate and effectively suppress diffraction effect by new materials , ( e.g. the fractal membranes ) , how to ensure a good vacuum to avoid the scattering of photons and dielectric dissipation caused by the dust and other particles , etc . all these issues and problems need careful theoretical and experimental study",
    ". more detailed investigation concerning such issues will be an object of further research and will be studied elsewhere .",
    "although usual analytic expressions of the relic gws are often complicated , the high - frequency asymptotic behavior of them in the microwave band can be expressed as simpler forms , and they can be described as superposition of all quasi - monochromatic components .",
    "the energy density of the hfrgws is positive definite , and their momentum densities have reasonable physical behavior , the em resonant response of the hfrgws in the laboratory frame of reference can be treated as resonance interaction of the quasi - monochromatic hfgws with the em fields .",
    "2 .   under the synchroresonance condition",
    ", coherent modulation of the hfrgw to the preexisting transverse bpfs would produce the transverse ppfs , the ppfs propagating along two orthogonal directions of the double transverse polarized electric modes of the gb are generated by the pure @xmath259 polarization and the pure @xmath260polarization states of the hfgw , respectively .",
    "the former has maximum at the longitudinal symmetrical surface of the gb where the transverse bpf vanishes , but the later and the bpf have the same distribution .",
    "thus , the former may provide an observable effect while the latter will be swamped by the bpf .",
    "3 .   the ppf reflected or transmitted by the fractal membranes exhibits a very small decay compared with the much stronger bpf . in our case",
    "this is the ppf produced by the pure @xmath259 polarization state of the hfgw .",
    "another interesting area would be the region in which the ppf and the bpf might reach up a comparable order of magnitude .",
    "although an obvious gap still exists between the theoretical estimation and reality , there are a potential advanced space and new ways [ 64 - 67 ] to further improve the sensitivity and the detecting ability of the em system .",
    "these new ways and technology will include generation of super - strong static magnetic fields ( e.g. , use of crystal channel effect ) , ultra - high sensitivity microwave single photon detectors such as a circuit quantum electrodynamics device ( cqed ) photon detector , ryberg atom cavity detector , squid array mux , josephon junction arrays , etc . , and possible optimized combination of them .",
    "they are possible to further narrow such gap and provide new promise .",

    "<S> we consider the electromagnetic ( em ) perturbative effects produced by the high - frequency gravitational waves ( hfgws ) in the ghz band in a special em resonance system , which consists of fractal membranes , a gaussian beam ( gb ) passing through a static magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is predicted , under the synchroresonance condition , coherence modulation of the hfgws to the preexisting transverse components of the gb produces the transverse perturbative photon flux ( ppf),which has three novel and important properties : ( 1)the ppf has maximum at a longitudinal symmetrical surface of the gb where the transverse background photon flux ( bpf ) vanishes ; ( 2 ) the resonant effect will be high sensitive to the propagating directions of the hfgws ; ( 3 ) the ppf reflected or transmitted by the fractal membrane exhibits a very small decay compared with very large decay of the much stronger bpf . </S>",
    "<S> such properties might provide a new way to distinguish and display the perturbative effects produced by the hfgws . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the high - frequency asymptotic behavior of the relic gws in the microwave band and the positive definite issues of their energy - momentum pseudo - tensor . + * pacs numbers : * 04.30.nk , 04.25nx , 04.30.db , 98.80.cq . </S>"
