    "the 20 - 60 - 20 rule is an empirical statement .",
    "it says that if we want to split the population into three groups , using some arbitrary benchmark criterion , then the ratio of 20% , 60% and 20% proves to give an efficient partition .",
    "the division is usually made according to the performance of each element in the population and the groups are referred to as negative , neutral and positive , respectively .",
    "the first group relates to elements of population which positively contribute to the considered subject ( e.g. effective workers , top sale managers , productive members ) , while the last one denotes the opposite .",
    "the middle set corresponds to the middle part of the population , having average performance .",
    "putting it another way we cluster the population basing on a notion of effectiveness .",
    "the importance of this rule comes from the fact that this particular partition seems to be the most effective one , for many empirical problems .",
    "let us present in details two common illustrations of this phenomena and then comment on the efficiency to make this idea more transparent .",
    "the first example considers sales departments . in almost any big company , the employees of the sales department could be split into three groups , maintaining 20 - 60 - 20 ratio .",
    "the first group are top performers , who make big profits , even without supervision .",
    "the middle group are people who need to be managed to make average but stable profits .",
    "the last group are people who are heading towards termination or resignation .",
    "they produce no good income , even when supervised .",
    "the second example relates to change capability .",
    "if you are willing to make substantial changes in any big institution , then on average 20% of the people are ready , willing and able to change , while 20% of people would not accept the change , whatever the cost .",
    "the middle 60% will wait to see how the situation turns out .",
    "corporations use the 20 - 60 - 20 rule widely in management and sales departments @xcite .",
    "one of the practical aspects of this phenomena relates to the fact that different procedures and methods are created to handle the efficiency in positive , negative and neutral group and the 20 - 60 - 20 ratio proves to be the most efficient partition .",
    "for example , in many problems related to human resource management , one should identify and focus his attention on the middle 60% , as this group could and should be managed efficiently .",
    "of course there are countless illustrations of this phenomena . one could consider financial market overall condition , fraud and theft capability among group of people , the structure of electorate , sport performance among athletes , potential of students , patient handling , medical treatments , etc .",
    "please see e.g.  @xcite , where the 20 - 60 - 20 ratio is used and the detailed procedures are proposed to handle many practical problems .",
    "the natural question is why this specific 20/60/20 ratio is valid in so many situations ?",
    "why not 10/80/10 or 30/40/30 ?",
    "is this a coincidence , or does it follow from some underlying and fundamental structure of the population ?",
    "while very popular among practitioners , no scientific evidence of the 20 - 60 - 20 principle has been presented yet , due to the authors knowledge . consequently , this noteworthy rule become more of a slogan , than the scientific fact",
    ".    the possible mathematical illustration of this phenomena , based on the dispersion and linear dependance measurement will be the main topic of this paper .",
    "we will show that if a ( multivariate ) random vector is distributed normally and we do conditioning based on the ( quantile function of ) first coordinate , then the ratio close to 20/60/20 imply a global equilibrium state , when dispersion and linear dependance measurement is considered . in particular , we prove that this particular partition implies the equality of covariance matrices , for all conditional vectors , implying some sort of global balance in the population",
    ". we will also discuss the case of monotone dependance using conditional kendall @xmath0 and spearman @xmath1 matrices .",
    "the material is organized as follows .",
    "the introduction is followed by a short preliminaries , where we establish basic notations used throughout this paper .",
    "next , in section  [ s : balance ] we introduce a mathematical model for the 20 - 60 - 20 rule and define _ the equilibrium state _ , using conditional covariance matrices .",
    "the 20 - 60 - 20 rule for multivariate normal vectors is discussed in section  [ s:206020 ] .",
    "theorem  [ th:1 ] might be considered as the main result of this paper .",
    "section  [ s : different.norm ] is devoted to the study of different equilibrium states , obtained using correlation matrices , kendall @xmath0 matrices and spearman @xmath1 matrices .",
    "in particular we present here some theoretical results , when spearman @xmath1 matrices are considered and a numerical example , illustrating the 20 - 60 - 20 rule for sample data . in section  [ s : non - normal ] we discuss shortly what happens if we loose the assumption about normality .",
    "the general elliptic case is considered here .",

    "let us fix an @xmath4-dimensional continuous random vector @xmath5 .",

    "similarly as in formula , given @xmath8 , we will use @xmath26 and @xmath27 to denote the conditional mean vector and the conditional covariance matrix , i.e. mean vector and conditional covariance matrix of a random vector with distribution @xmath11 .",

    "to split the whole population into three separate groups basing on a notion of effectiveness , we need to make an assumption about the probability distribution of the whole population and the given benchmark , which measures the effectiveness of each element in the population .",
    "we will assume that @xmath31 , i.e. the population could be described using @xmath4-dimensional random vector @xmath32 , which is normally distributed with mean vector @xmath33 and covariance matrix @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the benchmark level is determined by the first coordinate , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "please note that for multivariate normal this may be a linear combination of all other coordinates .",
    "one could look at other coordinates as various factors , which could influence the main benchmark .",
    "note that , if we talk about people measures or abilities , then gaussian functions , often described as bell curves , are a natural choice .",
    "we will seek for two real numbers @xmath18 $ ] and the corresponding partition @xmath36 which will admit some sort of equilibrium .",
    "in other words , we want to divide the whole population into three subgroups , corresponding to the lower @xmath37 , the middle @xmath38 and the upper @xmath39 of the population , where the effectiveness is measured by the benchmark .",
    "to do so , let us give a definition of _ equilibrium state _ or _",
    "global balance_.    [ def : equilibrium ] we will say that a _ global balance _ ( or _ equilibrium state _ ) is achieved in @xmath14 if @xmath40}=\\sigma_{[q_1,1-q_2]}=\\sigma_{[1-q_2,1]},\\ ] ] for some @xmath18 $ ] , such that @xmath19 .",
    "definition [ def : equilibrium ] seems to be very intuitive .",
    "indeed , the equality of conditional covariance matrices say that :    1 .",
    "the dispersion measured by variance is the same in each subgroup for any coordinate @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 ) .",
    "in particular the dispersion of the benchmark is the same everywhere .",
    "the linear dependance structure , measured by the conditional correlation matrices , is the same in all three subgroups .",
    "the first property creates a natural equilibrium state , as any perturbation leads to irregularity , when the square distance from the average member of each group is considered .",
    "the choice of this measure of dispersion seems to be natural , because people awareness of any differences should be high , as variance ( or standard deviation ) seems to be the simplest measure of variability .",
    "the second property relate to the linear dependence structure .",
    "the equality of correlation matrices imply a natural equilibrium between groups , as people tend to notice the simplest ( linear ) dependancies first .",
    "any shift between groups will cause dependence instability between them .",
    "in general ( i.e. when we loose assumption about normality ) the global balance might not exists or strongly depend on initial @xmath34 , when we consider some family parametrised by covariance matrices .",
    "if @xmath14 is a multivariate normal , it is reasonable to set @xmath43 , due to the symmetry of the gaussian density . for simplicity we will use @xmath44 for the symmetric case",
    "thus , we will in fact seek for @xmath45 such that the conditional covariance matrix for the lower @xmath46 of the population coincide with the conditional covariance matrices of the middle @xmath47 and upper @xmath46 .",
