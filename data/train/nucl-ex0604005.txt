    "the search for and study of the heaviest elements has yielded many surprises and expanded our knowledge and understanding of nuclear structure . even with the discovery of new superheavy elements with @xmath8 , the amount of structure information for @xmath9 , though growing , remains somewhat scarce .",
    "it has recently been discovered that the @xmath10no nucleus is surprisingly robust to rotation , sustaining angular momenta up to 22@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "further studies  @xcite have recently revealed the presence of isomeric states in other no isotopes .",
    "the reported success of using the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath12ca to form superheavy elements  @xcite suggests the need to examine other reactions with this projectile .",
    "reactions of @xmath12ca with heavier pb isotopes have been studied in detail . until recently",
    ", however , there were no data available for @xmath12ca induced reactions on the lightest stable pb isotope , @xmath2pb .",
    "this situation was rectified in 2001 with the systematic study by oganessian et al.@xcite utilizing the dubna gas - filled recoil separator ( dgfrs ) , and further improved in 2003 by belozerov et al.@xcite using the vassilissa electrostatic separator .",
    "the dgfrs study  @xcite only observed spontaneous fission ( sf ) decays ( no @xmath7 particles were seen ) .",
    "a half - life of @xmath13s was determined from fission events in the @xmath14 reaction .",
    "events from the similar reaction , @xmath15 , yielded a half - life of @xmath16s resulting in an average half - life of @xmath17s from 21 total decays .",
    "the maximum observed cross section for the @xmath14 channel was found to be @xmath18 nb at an excitation energy of 23.2 mev in the  compound nucleus .",
    "the vassilissa experiment  @xcite also observed only spontaneous fission decay .",
    "the latter measurement was also the first to use highly - enriched @xmath2pb ( 99.6% ) material .",
    "forty - two events were detected with a half - life of @xmath19s , and were assigned to .",
    "the data also included 22 events with a half - life of @xmath20s , which were attributed to  while noting that the possibility of these coming from an isomeric state of  could not be ruled out .",
    "neither experiment found evidence of the 250 @xmath4s sf lifetime originally assigned to  by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present experiment had two primary goals .",
    "the first was to verify the presence of multiple sf decay lifetimes in light nobelium isotopes using the mass separation capability of the fragment mass analyzer ( fma ) to unambiguously associate a specific mass with each measured decay lifetime .",
    "the second goal was to produce a sufficient number of residues to search for the previously unobserved @xmath7 branch in  in order to test current mass models .",
    "the cross section for @xmath14 at a laboratory energy of 220 mev is of the order of 10 nb  @xcite .",
    "however , the cross sections for the @xmath21 reactions on @xmath22pb at 220 mev are 30100 times larger  @xcite so that even small isotopic impurities in the target can contribute a sizable background yield to a measurement",
    ". therefore , highly - enriched ( @xmath1% ) targets of @xmath2pb ( 0.165% @xmath23pb , 0.064% @xmath24pb,0.064% @xmath25pb ) were used .",
    "even with such enrichment , residue production from these impurities could account for up to 15% of the total residue rate .",
    "the target consisted of four 90  pb segments , of average thickness 540  sandwiched between c entrance and exit foils of 40 and 10 , respectively , assembled into a wheel of 2.2 cm radius .",
    "this target wheel was rotated at 1800 rpm to prevent deterioration of the targets due to overheating from the high - intensity beam .",
    "the @xmath12ca beam was accelerated by the atlas superconducting linear accelerator at argonne national laboratory ( anl ) . the beam intensity on target , monitored via upstream faraday cups , an inductive pick - off immediately in front of the chamber , and a si monitor detector at 60 , ranged from 40 to 90 pna , with a time - averaged intensity of 56 pna for the entire experiment of 3.5 days . to further reduce the heat load on the targets",
    ", the beam spot was slightly defocused by reducing the fields in the last quadrupole before the target chamber .",
    "this increased the beam spot size from  0.5 mm diameter to @xmath261 mm in diameter .",
    "the beam was also deflected up to @xmath272.5 mm in the vertical direction using a magnetic steerer coupled to a triangle - wave generator .",
    "the vertical deflection does not affect the mass resolution since the fma dispersion is in the horizontal plane .",
    "( the modest defocusing does affect the final resolution , however . ) finally , to avoid unnecessary background due to beam scattering from the four target wheel spokes , the beam was chopped in synchronization with the wheel position .",
    "since the charge state distributions of evaporation residues ( evrs ) produced in heavy ion reactions are quite broad , the fma was set to a fractional charge state to allow the simultaneous collection of two neighboring charge states ( either @xmath28=19 - 20 or @xmath28=20 - 21 ) .",
    "the mass - to - charge ratio of the evrs was measured at the focal plane of the fma with a parallel grid avalanche counter ( pgac ) filled with isobutane .",
    "the transmitted ions then implanted into a 4 cm square , 40x40 double - sided silicon strip detector ( dssd ) positioned 40 cm downstream of the pgac .",
    "the data acquisition readout was triggered on any dssd signal above threshold , typically 150200 mv ( @xmath26300 kev ) .",
    "each dssd signal was routed to three separate amplifiers .",
    "one signal was passed through a delay - line amplifier to eliminate the energy `` pile - up '' characteristic of fast decays ( implant to decay time of a few @xmath4s ) .",
    "these amplifiers saturated ( full - scale range ) at 20 mev @xmath7-equivalent energy .",
    "a second branch was sent through a shaping amplifier , also with a full - scale range of 20 mev .",
    "these two signals are useful for residues implanted into the si detector and for @xmath7-like decay energies . the final branch was sent to another shaping amplifier with a full scale of @xmath26250 mev which recorded fission - like energies .",
    "the minimum observable correlation time , which is related to the response of the delay - line amplifiers , was found to be 2 @xmath4s for @xmath7-like decays .",
    "fission - like energies saturated the delay - line amplifiers and only implant - fission correlations longer than 5 @xmath4s could be observed .",
    "all events were tagged with the readout from a 100 ns clock to provide the time differences necessary for reconstructing correlations .    although the dssd had 40 strips on each side , three strips on each side were malfunctioning .",
    "in addition , a fourth strip on the front side was missing from the implant adcs because of a faulty module .",
    "this reduced the number of pixels available for the detection of implant - decay correlations from 1600 to 1332 .",
    "the high - gain channels ( 020 mev ) of the dssd strips were calibrated with a @xmath29pu-@xmath30 cm source . for these @xmath7 particles ,",
    "the energy resolution was typically 15 kev fwhm , and no worse than 40 kev .",
    "the low - gain channels ( 0 - 250 mev ) were calibrated relative to the high - gain ones by use of a precision pulser to generate signals over a range equivalent to 5500 mev .    to calibrate the fma and ensure that the electronics were functioning",
    "as planned , a test reaction of @xmath31ca,@xmath32 was used to produce @xmath33th residues .",
    "@xmath34th has a 1 @xmath4s half - life , making it a suitable benchmark for fast decay events .",
    "@xmath35th has a 10 @xmath4s half - life .",
    "data from this setup reaction were collected for an approximate beam dose of @xmath36 particles over nine hours .",
    "th created in the setup reaction and the associated fit ( solid line).[fig : thdecay ] ]    the setup reaction of 220 mev @xmath12ca + @xmath37yb mainly yields th isotopes of mass 219 and 220 . with the fma set for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ,",
    "several evrs were collected and their subsequent @xmath7 decay was observed .",
    "the decay curve measured for @xmath34th is presented in figure  [ fig : thdecay ] .",
    "half - lives of @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath4s with respective uncertainties of about 10% and 36% were measured .",
    "these are in good agreement with the known  @xcite values of 1.05@xmath270.03 and 9.7@xmath270.6 @xmath4s , respectively , for the two isotopes .",
    "these results confirm the proper functioning of the fma setup .",
    "the decay curve of also illustrates the effective minimum correlation time for reliable recoil - alpha identification of 2 @xmath4s .",
    "a total beam dose of @xmath42 @xmath12ca particles was delivered to the targets over the course of the experiment .",
    "data were collected with two different charge state settings for the fma , @xmath43 19.5 and 20.5 , to collect evrs with charge states @xmath44 1921 .",
    "the bulk of the data ( 98% ) were taken at the @xmath45 setting since the focal plane yield / pna was highest for this setting . the average rate ( scattered beam and residues ) incident on the entire dssd was 5 events per second per pna of incident beam .",
    "two different time windows were utilized to search for implant - decay correlations : a 500 @xmath4s window sensitive to the expected short decay time of the primary nobelium residues , and a longer 10 s window that emphasized both the heavier no residues produced from target impurities as well as their fermium daughters , which also have longer lifetimes .",
    "the analysis of observed decays from these impurities and random correlations are discussed in the following sections .",
    "an implant was defined as a signal in the dssd associated with a time - of - flight ( tof ) signal between the focal - plane pgac and the dssd , and located within a two - dimensional gate for residues in a plot of @xmath46 vs. tof .",
    "dssd signals in which the high - gain shaping amplifiers or delay - line amplifiers were saturated and the calibrated energy in the low - gain amplifiers was greater than 50 mev were interpreted as originating from fission .",
    "an energy threshold for fission was necessary since , for the very short decay times , residue implants and their decays occur in the same event and some implanting residues saturated the high - gain amplifiers .",
    "these could be discriminated from fission , though , as the residues only registered a signal of 2040 mev , whereas fission events were typically above 50 mev .",
    "signals from the front of the dssd with an energy between 6.5 and 11.5 mev were taken to be associated with @xmath7 particles .",
    "table [ tab : eventrates ] lists the observed rates for each of these types of signals for various periods of the experiment .",
    "the difference in @xmath7 rates before and after run 16 is mainly due to the presence of the 14.6 hr @xmath47rn , a decay product of the @xmath34th produced in the setup reaction . runs 616 immediately followed the setup reaction and a higher - than - desired background was observed as a result .",
    "after a 48 hour period of down time , which allowed this activity to decay away , the experiment resumed with runs numbered 18 and above .",
    "the implant rate is directly proportional to the average beam current on target , which steadily improved over the course of the experiment . in total , 158 recoil - fission correlations were observed .",
    ".event rates ( events / sec / pixel ) for each type of dssd signal examined  implants , fissions , and",

    "the calculations predict a particularly favored 2-quasineutron state at 1050 kev ( note that the energy does not include a correction for the additional effect of the spin - spin residual interaction that is of the order of 100 kev ) with a configuration @xmath55(5/2@xmath56[622],7/2@xmath56[624])@xmath57 .",
