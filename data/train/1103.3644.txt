    "the implications of the violation of bell inequalities @xcite in quantum mechanics ( qm ) are still controversial . on one side , their logical and probabilistic nature has been recognized and discussed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and their fundamental meaning traced back @xcite to boole s general notion of _ conditions of possible experience _",
    "in this perspective , their violation , which excludes representability of quantum mechanical predictions by a classical probability theory , shows general and fundamental differences between the classical and the quantum notion of event .    on the other ,",
    "the violation of bell inequalities is interpreted by many authors in terms of non local properties  of qm ; an extensive review of such positions is contained in ref .",
    "@xcite and a discussion of their basic logical steps is in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in our opinion , in general , the use of bell inequalities for the analysis of qm and of its interpretation is in a sense incomplete because their violations simply amounts to a negative result , i.e. the inconsistency between qm and _ the whole set _ of assumptions entering in their derivation .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to reconsider the situation from a more constructive point of view , beginning with qm predictions , trying to represent them by classical probability models in a sequence of steps and asking which step may fail .",
    "we recall that adopting a classical probability model exactly amounts to assuming that _ all variables together take definite , even if possibly unmeasurable , values _ , with definite probabilities .",
    "since a classical probability model is equivalent to its set of predictions for _ all _ correlations , while qm only predicts correlations between _ compatible _ observables , classical representability also amounts to an extension of qm predictions to _ unmeasurable correlations _",
    ", e.g. , correlations between two components of the spin _ of the same particle _ , or polarization of _ the same photon _",
    "along different directions .",
    "a central role is therefore played by the notion of _ extension of qm predictions to unmeasurable correlations_. we shall use basic and general constraints on such _ extensions _ to discuss the violation of bell inequalities in terms of actual properties of existing ( partial ) extensions rather than in terms of incompatibility between assumed principles . in particular , this will allow for a definite answer to the question _ what precisely is influenced _ in arguments on non - local effects in qm .",
    "the extension problem outlined above has been studied in general in @xcite .",
    "one of the result ( see sect.1 ) is that classical representability _ always holds _ for yes / no observables with compatibility relations described by _ a tree graph _ , i.e. a graph in which any two points are connected by exactly one path , with points representing observables and links predicted correlations .    in the case of four yes / no observables , @xmath5 , @xmath6",
    "compatible with @xmath7 , this implies that , for fixed @xmath4 , any pair of probabilities for the subsystems @xmath8 @xmath9 , assigning the same probability to the outcomes of @xmath4 , admits extensions to a probability on the whole system @xmath10 , each giving a definite value to the possibly unmeasurable correlation @xmath3 . as we will see , the results on tree graphs also imply that _ if a value can be assigned to _ @xmath3 consistent with two choices @xmath11 , @xmath12 for @xmath4 , then the whole system @xmath13 admits a classical representation .",
    "since the converse is obvious , it follows that the existence of a classical representation for given set of expectations @xmath14 , @xmath15 and correlations @xmath16 is equivalent to the possibility of giving a value to @xmath3 which is _ consistent with the two choices for @xmath4_.    the analysis of qm models with four yes / no observables is therefore reduced in general to the consistency ( i.e. a non void intersection ) between the ranges of the ( hypotetical , unmeasurable ) values for the correlation @xmath3 allowed by ( measurable ) given correlations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    with respect to the same conclusion obtained by fine @xcite",
    ", we stress that probabilistic descriptions of three - observable subsystem _ automatically exist _ and only their compatibility is in question ; moreover , only a repeated application of the results for tree graphs is required by our argument .    in sect.2 ,",
    "the possible range for @xmath3 , depending on the measurable correlations @xmath19 , is characterized in terms of elementary three - observable inequalities .",
    "qm states which violate bell inequalities are shown to give rise to disjoint intervals for the admissible values of @xmath3 in automatically existing probabilistic models for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this clearly shows that classical representability of such states exactly fails in the attribution of a value to an unmeasurable correlation .    actually , since bch inequalities ,",
    "more precisely , the eight inequalities discussed by fine @xcite , are equivalent to classical representability , their violation exactly amounts to the inconsistency of such an attribution .    the same discussion and result apply to the states introduced , on the same set of observables , by hardy @xcite and exploited in stapp s work @xcite , discussed by mermin @xcite .",
    "in particular , stapp s and mermin s discussion exactly concerns partial extensions and the origin of the inconsistency of the ranges of value for an unmeasurable correlation @xmath3 associated as above to the correlations of @xmath6 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .    in sect.3",
    ", the experiment proposed by greenberger , horne , shimony and zeilinger ( ghsz ) @xcite is analyzed along the same lines .",
    "the qm correlations defined by the ghsz state , between observables @xmath6 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath9 , are shown to extend to _ all correlations _ within the sets of observables @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; both extensions give _ unique values _ for an _ unmeasurable correlation _",
    ", @xmath26 , and the sign depends on the choice between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "again , only the attribution of a value to an unmeasurable correlation depends on the choice of an additional observable .    in the last section we will comment on the fact that such a dependence is the only basis for arguments about non local and non causal effects .",
    "a basic notion is that of yes / no observables , denoting physical devices producing , in each measurement , i.e. in each application to a physical system , two possible outcomes ; by _ experimental setting _ we will denote a collection of yes / no observables .    within an experimental setting ,",
    "an _ ( experimental ) context _ will denote a ( finite ) set of observables which can be measured together on the same physical system , in the precise sense that their joint application to a physical system gives rise to a statistics of their joint outcomes given by a classical probability , i.e. , by a normalized measure on the boolean algebra freely generated by them .",
    "observables appearing together in some context will be called _ compatible _ ; their correlations will be called _",
    "measurable _ , or _",
    "observable_.    in the following , quantum mechanics will be interpreted as a theory predicting probabilities associated to experimental contexts defined by sets of commuting projections .",
    "joint statistics of non compatible observables are not defined in the above setting ; correlations between incompatible observables will be called _ unmeasurable _ , or _",
    "unobservable_.    in particular , we will consider the _ bell - clauser - horne ( bch ) experimental setting _",
    ", consisting of two pairs ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , of incompatible _ yes",
    "/ no _ observables , taking values in @xmath29 ; the @xmath6 are compatible with the @xmath7 , i.e. they can be measured together , in the sense introduced above .",
    "such variables may be interpreted in terms of spin components or photon polarizations , each pair referring to one of a pair of particles , possibly in space - like separated regions .",
    "the experimental contexts given by qm consist , in the bch setting , of the four pairs @xmath30 ; probabilities are associated to contexts , see proposition [ prop : mis ] below , by the observed relative frequencies @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath16 . qm predictions for the bch setting precisely consist in probabilities on contexts , given by the spectral representation for the corresponding sets of commuting projectors .",
    "such a _ partial _ nature of qm predictions is a very general fact since the ( ordinary ) interpretation of qm precisely consists of a set of probability measures , each defined , by the spectral theorem , on the spectrum of a commutative subalgebra of operators in a hilbert space .",
    "such a structure has been formalized in @xcite as a _ partial probability theory _ on a _ partial boolean algebra_.    a basic problem for the interpretation of qm is _ the necessity _ of such partial structures ; in other words , _ whether they admit a classical representation _ , i.e. common probabilistic classical description in a probability space @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a set , @xmath35 a @xmath36-algebra of measurable ( with respect to @xmath37 ) subsets and @xmath37 is a probability measure on @xmath34 and all ( yes / no )",
    "variables are described by characteristic functions of measurable subsets . clearly , such a notion covers all kinds of hidden variables   theories , all ending in the attribution of values to all the observables , with definite probabilities .",
    "extensions have been discussed in general in @xcite .",
    "non trivial extensions , describing qm predictions through a reduced number of contexts , have been shown to arise in some generality and some of the results can be described in terms of graphs :    [ prop : tree1 ] consider any set of probabilities @xmath38 on a set of yes / no observables @xmath6 and correlations @xmath39 on a subset of pairs @xmath40 , defining a probability on each pair @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; describing observables @xmath6 as points and the above pairs as links in a graph , any subset of predictions associated to _ a tree subgraph",
    "_ admits a classical representation .",
    "[ prop : tree2 ] the same holds with _ yes / no observables _",
    "@xmath6 substituted by free boolean algebras @xmath44 , @xmath38 by probabilities on @xmath44 , @xmath45 by probabilities on the boolean algebra freely generated by the union of the sets of generators of @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "propositions [ prop : tree1 ] and [ prop : tree2 ] are proven in @xcite by induction on the number of links of the correlation tree , by an explicit construction of a probability on the boolean algebra generated by two algebras in terms of conditional probabilities with respect to their intersection .",
    "the resulting probabilities are in general not unique .",
    "the above propositions can be interpreted as providing automatic conditions for the realization of the possibility advocated by einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite to attribute a value to correlations between incompatible observables consistently with the qm predictions for the remaining , measurable , correlations ; actually , they do not make reference to qm and give conditions on compatibility relations allowing the extension of any set of predictions .",
    "it is also useful to recall the following elementary fact @xcite , which implies that it is sufficient to analyze correlations since they completely define a probability measure .",
    "[ prop : mis ] in a classical representation for @xmath47 observables @xmath48 , the probability measure is completely defined by all expectation values @xmath49 together with all possible correlations @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,  , @xmath52 .    in the bch",
    "setting , the two subsets @xmath53 , @xmath54 , with the correlations @xmath55 @xmath56 are described by tree graphs ( see fig.1 ( a),(b ) ) and admit therefore classical representations .",
    "it follows that all qm predictions can be reproduced by a pair of classical probability theories , one for the boolean algebra freely generated by @xmath57 the other for @xmath58 ; both sets of variables include @xmath17 and @xmath59 and give rise to predictions for the unmeasurable correlation @xmath60 .    in other terms ,",
    "_ given a choice for _ @xmath4 , one may consistently speak of the correlation @xmath60 .",
    "clearly , the existence of a classical representation for all the predictions in the bch setting implies the existence of a value for @xmath60 compatible with the different choices of @xmath4 .    on the other hand , if it is possible to give a value to @xmath60 independently of the choice @xmath11 , @xmath12 for @xmath4 , this defines , by proposition [ prop : mis ] , a probability on the boolean algebra @xmath61 generated by @xmath62 ; then , the application of proposition [ prop : tree2 ] to @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 implies classical representability of all the predictions for the bch setting ( see fig.1 ( c ) ) .     , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    classical representability and bch inequalities ( in the sense of ref.@xcite ) are therefore equivalent to the possibility of attributing a common value to the unmeasurable correlation @xmath60 in classical models for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    in the next section , we shall compute explicitly the range of @xmath60 allowed by the qm predictions for a pair of spin variables , in the zero total angular momentum state and for the state introduce by hardy @xcite .",
    "in this section we first recall simple constraints , for three @xmath65 valued random variables @xmath66 , satisfied by @xmath3 given @xmath49 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we then show that , for the predictions given by both the qm states discussed by bell and hardy @xcite , such constraints give rise , for different choices of @xmath4 , to incompatible values for @xmath3 .",
    "the possible ranges of correlations in a classical model for @xmath69 are given by the bell - wigner polytope @xcite , also discussed in @xcite .",

    "( [ p2 ] ) immediately follows from @xmath73 , which holds since for @xmath74 both factors are non positive , for @xmath75 they are both non negative ; moreover , the first relation in eq . ( [ p2 ] ) implies the second by interchanging @xmath4 and @xmath18 and eq .",
    "( [ p3 ] ) by interchanging @xmath4 and @xmath76 .",
    "the complete set of constraints @xcite includes three additional inequalities ; they are obtained from the above relations through the interchange of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the substitution of @xmath4 with @xmath77 in eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) , ( [ p2 ] ) ( and are not relevant for our analysis ) .    the constraints given by eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) , ( [ p2 ] ) ( [ p3 ] ) , applied to qm predictions for mean values and _ observable _ correlations , may give rise to ranges of values for the unobservable correlation @xmath78 which are disjoint for different choices of @xmath4 .",

    "( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) then give , for the unmeasurable correlation @xmath94 in probabilistic models for @xmath95 @xmath96 it follows that the value of @xmath97 must belong to one of two _ disjoint intervals _ , depending on whether one is considering the probability space for @xmath89 or that for @xmath95 , i.e. whether one chooses to measure @xmath11 or @xmath12 on the second subsystem .",
    "therefore , the validity of qm predictions for compatible observables _ does not allow _ to assign a definite value to the correlation @xmath3 , independent of the choice of the measurement to be performed on the second subsystem .",
    "the second example is hardy s experiment @xcite , also exploited in stapp s @xcite and mermin s @xcite discussion ; we shall refer to mermin s notation .",
    "as in the previous example , we have two spin @xmath79 particles and four yes / no observables , denoted by @xmath98 and @xmath99 , acting respectively on a `` left '' and a `` right '' particle .",
    "the state is described , up to a normalization factor , by the vector @xmath100 where , e.g , @xmath101 indicates a simultaneous eigenstate of the commuting observables @xmath102 and @xmath103 with eigenvalue @xmath77 on the left and @xmath104 on the right .",

    "independently of the specific expressions for @xmath108 and @xmath106 , qm predicts the following correlations ( corresponding to eqs.(6)-(9 ) in ref .",

    "a peculiarity of this case is that in classical models for @xmath95 the correlation @xmath3 is completely fixed ( to @xmath117 ) by the constraints imposed by measurable correlations .",
    "attributing the @xmath117 value is actually equivalent to asserting the logical implication @xmath118 , i.e. `` _ _ if _ _ the measurement of @xmath103 gives @xmath107 , _ then _ the measurement of @xmath119 gives @xmath104 '' ; such an implication _ holds in all classical models for _ @xmath95 _ and fails in all classical models for _ @xmath89 .",
    "in this section , the above analysis is applied to the case considered in @xcite and discussed in @xcite within a general framework unifying bell and kochen - specker kinds of results .    with a slight modification of the above terminology ,",

    "iii , with the identification @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , with @xmath131 @xmath132 ; in mermin s spin notation , they should be read as @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 .    in general ,",
    "quantum mechanical predictions consist in probability assignments within each of the eight contexts defined by the choice of three indexes @xmath139 ; e.g. a context is given by the choice @xmath17 , @xmath11 , @xmath27 , and the associated predictions by a probability on the boolean algebra freely generated by the propositions @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "the crucial point of ghsz and mermin s analysis is the observation that , for suitable states , qm predictions give perfect correlations(each correlation involving observables in a fixed context ) , which are not compatible with any ( context - independent ) assignment of values to the variables @xmath6 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the state considered by ghsz and mermin can be written , for the mermin spin variables @xmath143 , in the usual notation referring to the eigenvalues of @xmath144 , @xmath145 and gives the correlations @xmath146 values @xmath147 assigned to the above variables and reproducing the above correlations would satisfy the relations @xmath148 which have no solution since their product gives @xmath77 for the l.h.s .",
    ", @xmath104 for the r.h.s ..    following the program outlined above and using the notions and results of sect . 1 , we will extend the ghsz and mermin argument to show :    * the correlations eqs .",

    "again , the conclusion is that _ exactly a non observable correlation _ , @xmath154 , _ depends _ on the choice of the observable @xmath23 .    in order to derive @xmath155 - @xmath159",
    ", we first observe that @xmath159 follows immediately from proposition [ prop : tree2 ] , applied to the boolean algebra generated by @xmath160 and to its correlations with the observables @xmath142 and @xmath161 , forming a tree graph .",
    "concerning @xmath162 , observe that eqs .",
    "( [ perfcorr ] ) imply , for any probabilistic model reproducing them , @xmath163 and @xmath164 with probability @xmath77 , so that , with probability @xmath77 , @xmath165 ; equivalently , @xmath166 . in the same way ,",
    "( [ perfcorr2 ] ) imply @xmath167 ; such relations hold therefore for all probabilistic models reproducing , respectively , the qm correlations of the @xmath168 observables with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the existence of probabilities giving common values to all the other correlations follows from the construction below .",
    "the most involved issue is @xmath155 , which is non trivial since quantum mechanical predictions involve eight different contexts and @xmath155 states that the predictions given by the state ( [ psi ] ) extend to _ all correlations _ between variables inside each one of _ only two _ contexts .",
    "notice that propositions [ prop : tree1 ] and [ prop : tree2 ] do not imply such an extension , since the corresponding set of correlations is not given by a tree graph and in fact not all quantum states admit it , as also implied by the bch analysis ; the exact form of the quantum predictions we are going to extend is therefore important .",
    "it is easy to see that the state given by eq .",

    "( [ perfcorr]),([perfcorr2]),([otherpred1]),([otherpred2 ] ) involving the observables @xmath171 can be represented by a classical model , and the same for those involving @xmath172 , and that the two models give the same correlations between variables @xmath13 with the only exception of @xmath154 .",
    "the first classical model is defined as follows : let @xmath173 denote variables taking values @xmath77 and @xmath104 with probability @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath174 and define @xmath175 eqs .",

    "the two models give therefore identical predictions for all the correlations between the @xmath126 and @xmath4 variables , with the only exception @xmath182",
    "the discussion of bell inequalities usually begins with their derivation from general _ locality _ and _ reality _ principles .",
    "reality principles _ include _ hypothetical common attributions of values to observables even when they are not compatible according to qm ; once such attributions are assumed , any logical or probabilistic consideration automatically concerns extensions of qm predictions to unmeasurable correlations between incompatible observables .",
    "moreover , arguments about the possibility of considering measurements which _ could have been performed _ and the assumption that the results of such unperformedmeasurements satisfy the predictions of qm for their correlation with other , compatible and performed , measurements , lead @xcite @xcite to logical or probabilistic relations between quantum mechanically incompatible observables which precisely amount to partial extensions of qm predictions .",
    "we have shown that , independently of any additional principle or argument , partial extensions of qm predictions are always possible in cases described by tree graphs , that the ranges of values for correlations between quantum mechanically incompatible observables obtained by such extensions depend in general on the considered set of observables and that they may be incompatible for different sets .",
    "as shown by the hardy and the ghsz examples , this may happen even when _ all extensions _ , to a fixed allowed set of observables , of a set of qm predictions give the same _ perfect correlations _ to quantum mechanically incompatible observables .",
    "if the _ dependence of such correlations on a set of observables _ allowing for a partial extension is not taken into account , the result appears as a contradiction between logical consequences of qm predictions ( and of experimental results )",
    ".    moreover , precisely unmeasurable correlations depend on a choice in a far or future space - time regions in the discussion of locality and causality principles .",
    "in fact , in the bch setting , identifying @xmath22 with observables measured in a space - like separated region , only and exactly @xmath183 depends on the choice of @xmath22 ; alternatively , if @xmath22 is measured in a future region , such a dependence violates causality in the precise sense that any hypotetical record of the value of @xmath3 depends on a future choice .",
    "all the above violations  exactly concern extensions of qm predictions to _ correlations between quantum mechanically incompatible observables _ , e.g. , between two different spin components of _ the same _ particle or polarization directions of _ the same _ photon .",
    "a discussion of the violation of bch inequalities in terms of unobservable correlations has also been given in ref .",
    "a ( different , but related ) notion of extension of quantum correlations  is also central in the recent discussion of the einstein - podolsky - rosen notion of reality in ref .",
