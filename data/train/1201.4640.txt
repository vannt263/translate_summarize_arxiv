    "these @xmath12channel exchanges obey multi - regge kinematics ( mrk ) , when the particles produced in the collision are strongly separated in rapidity .",

    "@xmath1-dijet inclusive production , this means the following : @xmath0-jet ( mrk ) or @xmath1-dijet ( qmrk ) is produced in the central region of rapidity , while other particles are produced with large modula of rapidities .",
    "the parton reggeization approach @xcite is based on the hypothesis of parton reggeization in @xmath12channel exchanges at high energy @xcite .",
    "it was used for the description of a large number of hard processes at the modern hadron colliders and the obtained results confirm the assumption of a dominant role of mrk or qmrk production mechanisms at high energy .",

    "the theoretical background of a parton reggeization approach is the effective quantum field theory implemented with the non - abelian gauge - invariant action including fields of reggeized gluons @xcite and reggeized quarks @xcite , which was proposed by l.  n.  lipatov in 1995 @xcite . in this effective theory",

    "we take into account two mechanisms of @xmath0-jet production : the open @xmath0-quark production and `` jet - like '' @xmath0-quark production via gluon - to - bottom - pair fragmentation @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath0-quark jet as an isolated , by the jet - cone condition @xcite , hadronic jet containing one @xmath18-quark or @xmath1-quark pair .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-jet production cross section can be written as a sum of two terms .",
    "the first one represents a so - called `` open @xmath0-quark '' production , when the @xmath0-jet contains @xmath18-quark which is produced directly in the hard partonic subprocess .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : two ] the parton reggeization approach is briefly reviewed .",

    "we study @xmath0-jet production in the region of large @xmath0-quark transverse momentum @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a @xmath0-quark mass . at the present time ,",
    "the conventional approach for calculation of the @xmath21quark production cross sections is based on the next - to - leading ( nlo ) approximation in perturbative qcd and collinear parton model @xcite .",
    "it is well known that fixed - order perturbation qcd calculations are applicable when the transverse momentum @xmath10 of the produced heavy @xmath21quark is not much larger than its mass @xmath20 . in the case",
    "when the transverse momentum significantly exceeds the mass , the large logarithms of type @xmath22 arise to all orders of @xmath23 , so that a fixed - order approach breaks down   @xcite .",
    "it is possible to resum all these logarithms in the fragmentation approach using the factorization theorem , which states that the cross section for the production process of high-@xmath10 @xmath21quark can be written in factorized form as a convolution of the short - distance partonic cross section of parton @xmath24 production with the fragmentation function @xmath25 for a formation of a @xmath21quark from the parton @xmath24 : @xmath26 the fragmentation functions for heavy quarks in perturbative qcd have been studied at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd approach in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the experimentally measured transverse energy @xmath27 ( or the transverse momentum @xmath10 ) of @xmath0-jet includes transverse energies ( transverse momenta ) of all partons inside some jet - cone in the rapidity  azimuthal angle plane , which radius is defined as follows , @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "such a way , it is insignificant which part of the initial parton four - momentum is transferred to the @xmath0-quark , and we can simplify the formula ( [ eq : frag1 ] ) to the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a @xmath0-quark multiplicity in the @xmath24-parton jet .",
    "it is obvious that a @xmath0-quark multiplicity in a gluon - initiated jet greatly exceeds a @xmath0-quark multiplicity in any quark - initiated jets , @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we will take into account only main contribution from the gluon - to - bottom - pair fragmentation @xmath33 .",
    "let us note that in this case the @xmath1-pair is considered as a one @xmath0-quark jet .    to describe inclusive @xmath0-jet and @xmath1-jet cross sections in terms of the parton reggeization approach , in the lo we need to consider gluon fusion subprocesses of open @xmath0-quark and gluon production only , which are to be dominant at the high energy ,",
    "they write : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a reggeized gluon and @xmath36 is a yang - mills gluon , respectively , with four - momenta indicated in parentheses .",
    "the contribution of the partonic subprocess ( [ rrgg ] ) can be neglected in comparison with the contribution of the subprocess ( [ rrbb ] ) because of the strong suppression by the @xmath37 fragmentation ( @xmath38 ) for both produced gluons . in ref .  @xcite it was shown ,",
    "that at the tevatron energy range , the contribution of the subprocesses @xmath39 and @xmath40 with initial reggeized quarks is sufficiently smaller comparing to the dominant contribution of the subprocesses ( [ rrg ] ) and ( [ rrbb ] ) , and the former becomes sizeable only at the very large @xmath0-jet transverse momentum @xmath10 . as the lhc",
    "energy exceeds by a factor @xmath41 the one of the tevatron collider , we estimate a quark - antiquark annihilation contribution to be even much smaller and therefore do not consider it in the present analysis . performing a study of high - transverse - momentum @xmath21quark production ( @xmath42 ) in the collinear parton model",
    ", we have an additional @xmath21quark production mechanism , namely a production via @xmath21flavor excitation , where @xmath43quarks are considered as partons in the colliding protons .",
    "for example , this mechanism has been used successfully to describe @xmath44meson @xmath45spectra at the tevatron and lhc in nlo calculations of the parton model @xcite .",
    "we have used a similar idea in our previous study of inclusive @xmath21jet production at the tevatron within the parton reggeization approach @xcite . in this work we took into account the lo in @xmath46 contribution from @xmath47 partonic subprocess @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a reggeized @xmath21quark . as it is shown in the fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the sum of this contribution and a contribution from the subprocess ( [ rrbb ] ) strongly overestimates the experimental data . in the present analysis",
    "we ignore a contribution from the subprocess ( [ brb ] ) .",
    "first , we avoid any chance of a double - counting between subprocesses ( [ amp : rrbb ] ) and ( [ brb ] ) .",
    "second , the conception of quark reggeization for a @xmath21quark inside a proton seems to be wrong .",
    "@xmath21quarks are produced preferably at the last step of qcd - evolution at the large scale @xmath50 , and their pdf is proportional to a large logarithm @xmath51 .",
    "however , the qcd - evolution of a reggeized parton should be valence - like .",
    "it means , the reggeized parton must be a @xmath12channel parton throughout all steps of qcd - evolution in the parton ladder .",
    "but , a @xmath21quark conventional collinear pdf , which we take as input for a kmr ( blmlein ) prescription to obtain a @xmath21quark unintegrated pdf , satisfies sea - like qcd - evolution . for this reason we strongly overestimate a value of a @xmath21quark unintegrated pdf .",
    "the more adequate way should be to consider a subprocess @xmath52 with a collinear @xmath21quark in the initial state , instead of subprocess ( [ brb ] ) .",
    "but even in this case a problem of double - counting still exist .",
    "that is why in the present study we consider reggeized - gluon induced contributions , like ( [ rrg ] ) and ( [ rrbb ] ) , only .",
    "the squared amplitude of subprocess  ( [ rrg ] ) reads @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 representing the transverse momenta of initial reggeized gluons , and @xmath59 is the azimuthal angle enclosed between them .",
