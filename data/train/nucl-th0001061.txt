    "the study of nucleon - nucleon correlation effects is important part of the contemporary nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the independent particle models ( ipm ) consists in the assumption that nucleons move independently in a mean field created by the same nucleons .",
    "consequently , each coherent motion of the nucleons creates changes in the mean field .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation accounts only partially for the dynamic nucleon correlations .",
    "there exist many experimental data ( see e.g. the review in @xcite ) showing that the ipm are unable to describe basic nuclear characteristics .",
    "for instance , the nucleon momentum and density distributions in nuclei can not be reproduced simultaneously @xcite .",
    "this is also the case with the occupation numbers , the hole - state spectral functions , with characteristics of nuclear reactions and others @xcite .",
    "this imposes the development of correlation methods going beyond the limits of the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) which account for nucleon - nucleon correlations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this can be reached by extending the class of the trial functions which is used at the diagonalization of the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite is one of the methods beyond the mfa which have been applied successfully to studies of the collective nuclear motions .",
    "for instance , the gcm has been applied to investigate the breathing - mode giant monopole resonance within the framework of the relativistic mean - field theory in @xcite . in it the constrained incompressibility and the excitation energy of isoscalar giant monopole states were obtained for finite nuclei with various sets of lagrangian parameters .",
    "an extension of the method of ref .",
    "@xcite by using a more general ansatz for the generating functions of the gcm and by including the isovector giant monopole states has been done in @xcite .",
    "the use of the skyrme effective forces has simplified the study of the monopole , dipole and quadrupole isoscalar and isovector vibrations in light double magic nuclei @xcite .",
    "an approach to the gcm using square - well and harmonic - oscillator construction potentials has been applied to calculate the energies of the ground and first monopole excited state , as well as the density and the nucleon momentum distributions in the ground state of @xmath0he , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca nuclei @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the occupation numbers , the depletion of the fermi sea and the natural orbitals ( no ) which diagonalize the ground state one - body density matrix ( odm ) have been calculated .",
    "the no related to the ground state and the single - particle potentials corresponding to them have been studied in detail in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the two - nucleon center - of - mass and relative motion momentum distributions of @xmath3 pairs in the @xmath0he , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca nuclei have been calculated .",
    "the existence of high - momentum components in the one - nucleon and two - nucleon momentum distributions in the case of the square - well construction potential with infinite walls within the gcm has been obtained .",
    "the studies of the energies , the nucleon momentum and density distributions in @xmath0he and @xmath1o nuclei have been extended by means of a two generator coordinate scheme in @xcite .    in the last years",
    "giant resonances with various multipolarities different from the well - known dipole resonance have been discovered . among these collective excitations",
    "the monopole excitations take a particular place .",
    "the isoscalar giant monopole resonances or the so - called breathing vibrational states ( with @xmath4 at energies of approximately 13 to 20 mev ) have been well established experimentally ( e.g. @xcite ) and have been considered to be compressional nuclear vibrations .",
    "their study concerns the important problem of the compressibility of finite nuclei and nuclear matter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the description of such states is related mainly to general characteristics of the nuclei and weakly to the peculiarities of nuclear structure .",
    "recently , in a series of articles bishop et al.(see @xcite and references therein ) applied the translationally invariant cluster ( tic ) method to light nuclei , in particular to the @xmath0he nucleus .",
    "the basic properties , such as the energies and the density distributions of the ground and first excited breathing mode state in @xmath0he have been considered .",
    "the @xmath0he nucleus has a well - established spectrum of excited states .",
    "calculations for the monopole oscillations of helium which practically involve the whole nuclear volume have been performed on the base of the nonlinear time - dependent hartree - fock  ( tdhf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "its small amplitude limit , namely the random phase approximation  ( rpa ) , has been used extensively to describe nuclear collective motion @xcite .",
    "the tdhf method @xcite and the relativistic rpa @xcite have been recently used to extend the study of isoscalar monopole modes in finite nuclei up to @xmath5pb .",
    "it has been found that some effective lagrangians can describe ground states and giant resonances as well , and in particular , they can predict correctly breathing mode energies in medium and heavy nuclei . in general , it has been pointed out that when going from heavy to lighter systems the trend is that the collectivity becomes weaker .",
    "this fact poses the question about the role of different kinds of nucleon - nucleon correlations corresponding to single - particle and collective motion modes and , therefore , the investigations on the correlation effects became an important task in the nuclear theory .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the main characteristics of the ground and , in particular , of the first excited monopole state in the @xmath0he , @xmath1o and @xmath2ca nuclei within the gcm using skyrme - type effective forces .",
    "it concerns the energies , the density distributions and radii , the nucleon momentum distributions , the natural orbitals and occupation numbers , as well as the pair center - of - mass and relative density and momentum distributions . as known , the natural orbital representation ( nor)@xcite gives a model - independent effective single - particle picture for the correlated states .",
    "we emphasize that in our work this is done also for the first excited monopole state in the nuclei considered on the basis of the odm calculated for this state .",
    "it is known that the results of the gcm calculations depend on the type of the construction potential used to define the generating function in the method . in the present work we use three construction potentials , namely the harmonic oscillator ( ( ho ) where the oscillator parameter is a generator coordinate ) , the square - well with infinite walls ( ( sw ) where the radius of the well is a generator coordinate ) and woods - saxon ( ( ws1 ) where the diffuseness of the woods - saxon well is a generator",
    "coordinate and ( ws2 ) where the radial parameter of woods - saxon well is a generator coordinate ) .",
    "the values of the radial parameter in the ws1 case and the diffuseness parameter in the ws2 case are taken from @xcite . in our opinion",
    ", the calculations performed in this work can give an essential information about beyond mfa effects ( accounted for in the considered approach to the gcm ) on the mentioned characteristics .",
    "the results are compared with the available empirical data and with the calculations of other theoretical methods .",
    "the basic relations of the gcm are given in section 2 .",
    "the results of the calculations and the discussion are presented in section 3 .",
    "the conclusions from the work are given in section 4 .",
    "in the case of one real generator coordinate @xmath6 the trial many - body wave function in the gcm is written as a linear combination@xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the generating function , @xmath9 is the generator or weight function and @xmath10 is the mass number of the nucleus .",

    "the one - body density matrix @xmath34 of the ground ( @xmath35 ) and the first excited monopole ( @xmath36 ) states in this gcm scheme has the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 it follows from ( 12 ) that the nucleon density distribution @xmath39 and the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath40 of the ground and the first excited monopole states can be expressed as : @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the fourier transform of @xmath46 .",
    "the rms radii can be calculated using the expression : @xmath47 as shown e.g. in @xcite the attractive properties of the single - particle description can be preserved in the correlation methods using the natural orbital representation @xcite . in it",
    "the one - body density matrix has the simple form : @xmath48 where the natural orbitals ( no ) @xmath49 form a complete orthonormal set of single - particle wave functions which diagonalize the density matrix @xmath50 for the ground and the first excited monopole states . the natural occupation numbers ( on ) @xmath51 for the state @xmath52 satisfy the conditions : @xmath53 it is seen from ( [ den ] ) that the natural orbitals and the occupation numbers can be found solving the equation : @xmath54 for nuclei with total spin @xmath55 the one - body density matrix can be diagonalized in the @xmath56 subspace ( @xmath57 being the quantum numbers corresponding to the angular momentum , total momentum and its projection ) . in the case of nuclei with spherical symmetry the natural orbitals have the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the radial part of the no s and @xmath60 is the spherical function .",
    "the substitution of @xmath61 from ( 22 ) and @xmath50 from ( 12 ) in equation ( 21 ) and the integration over the angular variables give the following equation for the radial part @xmath62 of the no s and the occupation numbers @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 the summation in ( 24 ) is performed over all single - particle wave functions with given @xmath66 forming the slater determinant of the generating function and @xmath67 are the radial parts of these functions .    the nucleon density distribution @xmath68 and the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath69 for nuclei with @xmath55 can be written in the following form in the nor : @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the radial part of the no in the momentum space and @xmath73 are spherical bessel functions of order @xmath66 .",
    "the depletion of the fermi sea can be defined by the expression : @xmath74 where @xmath75 refers to the fermi sea .",
    "the rms radius of the no @xmath49 is given by the expression : @xmath76 the two - body density matrix @xmath77 in the gcm has the form : @xmath78 where the coordinate @xmath79 includes the spatial coordinate @xmath80 , as well as the spin ( @xmath81 ) and isospin ( @xmath82 ) variables .",
    "if the generating wave function is a slater determinant constructed from a complete set of one - particle wave functions @xmath83 the matrix @xmath84 can be expressed as @xcite :  @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 is the inverse matrix of : @xmath88 and @xmath89 the two - particle emission experiments require some knowledge of physical quantities associated with the tdm .",
    "for example , using the two - body density matrix @xmath90 in coordinate space , eq.([tbdm1 ] ) , one can define the pair center - of - mass local density distribution : @xmath91 and the pair relative local density distribution : @xmath92 in momentum space the associated pair center - of - mass and relative momentum distributions can be defined : @xmath93 @xmath94 the physical meaning of @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the probability to find two particles displaced of a certain relative distance @xmath97 or moving with relative momentum @xmath98 , respectively , while @xmath99 and @xmath100 represent the probability to find a pair of particles with center - of - mass coordinate @xmath101 or center - of - mass momentum @xmath102 .",
    "the hill - wheeler equation ( 2 ) is solved using a discretization procedure similar to that of refs . @xcite .",
    "the values of the skyrme - force parameters in ( 6 ) in the case of square - well construction potential are the same as in @xcite .",
    "they are determined to give an optimal fit to the binding energies of @xmath103he , @xmath104o and @xmath105ca obtained from the hill - wheeler equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the parameter set values @xmath106 lead to the energies of the ground @xmath107 and the first monopole excited @xmath108 states ( without the coulomb energy ) shown in table [ t1 ] . in the case of the harmonic - oscillator and woods - saxon construction potentials skm * parameter set values ( @xmath109)@xcite giving realistic binding energies are used .",
    "it can be seen from table [ t1 ] that the energies obtained with ws1 are close to that obtained with ho , while the energies corresponding to ws2 are closer to that calculated with sw construction potential .",
    "the values of the excitation energies @xmath110 of the first monopole state ( @xmath4 ) calculated within the gcm are given and compared with other calculations and some experimental data in table [ t2 ] .",
    "it is seen that the gcm results with ho construction potential and in the ws1 case are in good agreement with the result of brink and nash @xcite for @xmath104o nucleus and they are closer to the experimental values than the gcm results with the sw construction potential .",
    "the energy of the first excited @xmath111 in @xmath103he obtained in the present work is compared in table [ t2 ] with the recent refined calculations of bishop et al @xcite within the tic method as well as with the results of the coupled rearrangement of the channels method @xcite .",
    "the one - body distribution function corresponding to the density distribution @xmath39 from ( 14 ) is given by the expression : @xmath114 the function @xmath115 of the ground ( i=0 ) and the first excited monopole ( i=1 ) states of @xmath103he calculated in the gcm are compared in figure 1 with those obtained in the tic method .",
    "it can be seen that there is a large difference in the behaviour of the function @xmath116 for both states .",
    "this is due to the strong increase of the size of the nucleus , as is shown in table [ t3 ] : the rms radius increases from 1.89 fm for the ground state to 3.00 fm for the first excited monopole state in the case of the ho , from 1.77 fm to 2.86 fm in the case of the sw and from 1.85 fm to 3.29 fm when using ws2 .",
    "the significantly larger values of rms radii for the first excited state in @xmath117 nucleus in respect to their ground state values support the breathing - mode interpretation . at the same time , the nature of the first excited monopole state in @xmath117 is not still well understood .",
    "an attempt to solve this problem is made in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is concluded that the @xmath36 state is dominated by the @xmath118 configuration .",
    "the rms radii of the ground and of the first excited monopole states in @xmath104o and @xmath105ca are also presented in table [ t3 ] .",
    "we note that the rms radii of the ground state in these nuclei obtained with woods - saxon construction potential are very close to the experimental values .    for the first excited monopole state the one - body distribution function @xmath119 calculated within the gcm using the ws2 potential and that one calculated within the tic method are in good agreement .",
    "in contrast with this state , for a ground state both methods yield functions @xmath120 which differ significantly .",
    "this is due to the spurious centre - of - mass motion correction for @xmath103he which is accounted for in the tic method @xcite . at the same time effect",
    "does nt influence substantially the first excited monopole - state density .",
    "the nucleon density distributions of @xmath104o and @xmath105ca of the ground @xmath121 and the first excited monopole @xmath122 states obtained within the gcm are presented in figures 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "for the first excited monopole state the density distribution @xmath123 decreases in the central region of both nuclei and increases for large @xmath124 .",
    "this behaviour corresponds to the increase of the rms radius in the first excited state .",
    "it can be seen also that the difference in the rms radii @xmath125 decreases with the increase of the mass number .",
    "the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath126 is one of the nuclear quantities which are sensitive to various types of nucleon - nucleon correlations .",
    "the momentum distributions for the ground and first excited monopole states of @xmath104o have been calculated in the gcm using eqs.(15 ) and ( 17 ) and are shown in figure 4 .",
    "as can be seen there is no essential difference between the behaviour of the @xmath126 in the ground and in the first excited monopole states .",
    "it is seen from figure 4 that the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath126 obtained in the gcm depends on the construction potentials considered .",
    "the use of sw potential leads to an existence of high - momentum tail of @xmath126 which is not the case when the ho and ws potentials are used .",
    "here we would like to note that :    \\(i ) the single - particle wave functions corresponding to the sw potential contain themselves high - momentum components due to the particular form of the potential and they are reflected in the gcm result ,    \\(ii ) the lack of substantial high - momentum tail in @xmath126 when using ho and ws construction potential leads to the conclusion that the nucleon - nucleon correlations included in the gcm approach are not of short - range type .",
    "an additional study of the correlations accounted for in the gcm concerns some two - body characteristics and we will discuss the results for them in subsection c.      the natural orbitals and occupation numbers have been calculated using eqs.(21)-(24 ) . a discretization procedure with respect to both @xmath124 and @xmath127 has been applied solving eq.(23 ) and the resulting matrix eigenvalue problem has been solved numerically .",
    "the natural orbitals obtained in the coordinate space are plotted in figure 5 for the @xmath104o nucleus .",
    "the corresponding rms radii and the natural occupation numbers of @xmath103he , @xmath104o and @xmath105ca are shown in tables 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "one can see from table [ t4 ] and from the shape of the no s given in figure 5 that the rms radii of the natural hole - states increase from the ground state to the first excited state .",
    "the occupation numbers of the natural hole - states decrease in the first excited monopole state , while those corresponding to the natural particle - states increase ( see table [ t5 ] ) . as can be seen from the same table [ t5 ] , the depletion of the fermi sea increases in the first excited state .",
    "this is strongly expressed for the @xmath103he nucleus .",
    "the calculated depletion decreases with the increase of the mass number .",
    "the pair center - of - mass and relative density and momentum distributions eqs.([denrelr])-([denrelk ] ) are calculated by using of ho and sw potentials and are given in figure 6 for the ground state of @xmath104o nucleus .",
    "they are compared with the results obtained within the low - order approximation of the jastrow correlation method ( jcm ) @xcite where the short - range correlations are explicitely involved . as it is seen from figure 6(@xmath128 ) the relative distributions @xmath129 obtained in gcm and jcm have different behaviour in the region from 0 to 0.4 fm .",
    "this fact shows that the gcm does nt take into account short - range but other kind of correlations which are obviously related with the collective motion of the nucleons .",
    "the curves of @xmath130 calculated for both potentials decrease rapidly down at k@xmath1311@xmath132 while the result obtained within the jcm shows a high - momentum tail .",
    "in the present work the characteristics of the ground and the first excited monopole states of the three nuclei @xmath103he , @xmath104o and @xmath105ca are studied within the gcm using different construction potentials .",
    "though the results are sensitive to the type of the construction potentials used , some general conclusions can be summarized as follows    \\(i ) there is an increase of the rms radius in the first excited monopole state as a consequence of the increase of the density distribution for large @xmath124 .",
    "\\(ii ) there is not an essential difference between the behaviour of the nucleon momentum distribution in the ground and in the first excited monopole state .",
    "\\(iii ) the use of the natural orbital representation makes it possible to study the effective single - particle picture not only of the ground , but also of the first excited monopole state .",
    "it is established that the depletion of the fermi sea increases considerably in the first excited monopole state .",
    "this is strongly expressed in the case of @xmath103he .",
    "the calculated depletion decreases with the increase of the mass number .",
    "\\(iv ) the study of the natural orbitals in the ground and the first excited monopole state shows that there are not substantial changes in their forms for a given @xmath133-state when they are calculated for the ground and the first excited monopole state .",
    "the rms radii of the hole - state natural orbitals are larger in the case of the first excited monopole state in comparison with those for the ground state .",
    "\\(v ) the results on the one- and two - body density and momentum distributions , occupation probabilities and natural orbitals obtained within the gcm using various construction potentials show that the nucleon - nucleon correlations accounted in the approach are different from the short - range ones but are rather related to the collective motion of the nucleons .",
    "it turns out that the latter are also important in calculations of one- and two - body overlap functions which are necessary in the calculations of the cross - sections of one- and two - nucleon removal reactions .",
    "the work on the applications of the gcm overlap functions for the description of cross - section of @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 reactions is in progress .",
    "this work was partly supported by the bulgarian national science foundation under the contract no.@xmath137 - 809 .",
