    "hence , renormalized @xmath211 , the shifted or fluctuation - corrected @xmath33 , and correspondingly , any putative smpt should be accessible in experiments .",
    "furthermore , if we construct an effective landau mf in terms of @xmath118 and @xmath211 , the first order transition temperature @xmath78 also gets a shift . since @xmath211 is expected to be experimentally accessible , the shifted @xmath78 should also be accessible experimentally .",

    "the above analysis has been done in the spirit of bare perturbation theories , in terms of the bare model parameters .",
    "we note that if we use @xmath77 instead of @xmath1 , the above diagram would not have given any diverging contribution to @xmath33 and only the equilibrium correction would be relevant .",
