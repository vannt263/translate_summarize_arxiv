    "the ionic hubbard model ( ihm ) has been proposed @xcite for the description of the neutral - ionic transition in mixed - stack charge - transfer organic crystals tetrathiafulvalene-@xmath0-chloranil.@xcite in the 90 s the interest on the model increased due to its potential application to ferroelectric perovskites.@xcite this model is a hubbard hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 and on - site repulsion @xmath2 , on a bipartite lattice with alternating diagonal energy @xmath3 for the two sublattices . at half filling and in the atomic limit ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the ground state is a band insulator ( bi ) for @xmath5 ( the sites with diagonal energy @xmath6 are doubly occupied ) , but is a mott insulator ( mi ) for @xmath7 ( all sites singly occupied ) .",
    "the situation is similar to the extended hubbard model ( ehm ) with @xmath8 but nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite in the ehm for @xmath10 , as @xmath11 increases , there is a transition from a charge density wave ( cdw ) insulator , with alternating doubly occupied and empty sites to a mi for @xmath12 .",
    "however , while in this model , the result persists for finite small @xmath1 as it has been shown in second order perturbation theory in @xmath1,@xcite perturbation theory in the ihm becomes invalid at @xmath13 and non - trivial charge fluctuations persist even in the strong coupling limit .",
    "furthermore while previous results in the ihm were interpreted in terms of only one transition , fabrizio _ et al . _",
    "used arguments based on field theory , which assumes weak coupling ( essentially @xmath14 ) , to propose an alternative scenario that includes two transitions as @xmath2 is increased : the first one is an ising - like charge transition at @xmath15 from the bi to a bond - ordered insulator ( boi ) .",
    "when @xmath2 is further increased , the spin gap vanishes at @xmath16 due to a kosterlitz - thouless transition between the boi and the mi.@xcite an intermediate boi phase also takes place in the ehm  for large enough @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    after the proposal of fabrizio _ et al .",
    "_ , several studies of the 1d ihm tried to identify the number and the nature of the different phases .",
    "_ determined the phase diagram using the method of crossing of energy levels , which for this model turns out to be equivalent to the method of jumps of berry phases.@xcite the basic idea is that while in finite systems conventional order parameters such as charge and spin structure factors vary continuously at a phase transition , in a system of length @xmath17 one may define charge and spin topological numbers which change discontinuously at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the charge ( spin ) berry phase has a step at @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , and extrapolating these numbers to the thermodynamic limits leads usually to accurate results for the transition lines.@xcite @xmath18 might be detected in transport experiments through some molecules or nanodevices.@xcite torio _",
    "_ found a phase diagram consistent with the proposal of fabrizio _ et al .",
    "_ for weak coupling_. _ they also found that for strong coupling the intermediate boi phase persists with a width @xmath20 @xmath21 . recently",
    ", similar methods were used to check the characteristics of each quantum phase transition and confirm previous results in systems up to 18 sites.@xcite however , monte carlo calculations for the bond - order parameter , polarization and localization length were interpreted in terms of only one transition at @xmath22 and two phases ( bi and boi).@xcite in addition , some density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) calculations have not detected the transition at @xmath23.@xcite instead , other dmrg calculations using careful finite - size scaling are consistent with three phases and two transitions and with the phase diagram of torio _ et al .",
    "_ , although they suggest a smaller width of the boi phase for small @xmath1 ( @xmath24 @xmath25).@xcite    the numerical difficulties for detecting the kosterlitz - thouless transition are originated in the exponential closing of the spin gap as @xmath2 approaches to @xmath23 from below .",
    "consequently , direct numerical calculations of the relevant correlation functions are unable to detect a sharp transition at @xmath26 unless a very careful finite - size scaling is made .",
    "the same difficulty appears in the hubbard chain with correlated hopping , where the existence and the position of the transition is confirmed by field theory @xcite and exact @xcite results .",
    "in the scenario with only one transition there is still a question about the nature of the large @xmath2 phase ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "wilkens and martin @xcite suggested that the mi phase does not exist for finite @xmath1 , i.e. , the spin gap remains open for any finite @xmath2 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the strong coupling expansion for @xmath28 , which maps the ihm onto an effective spin hamiltonian @xmath29 with closed spin gap.@xcite the absence of a spin gap is also supported by the _ power - law decay _ of charge - charge correlation functions ( in spite of the presence of a charge gap ) that have been calculated numerically @xcite and analytically ( using @xmath29),@xcite with very good agreement between both results .",
    "this is a consequence of the strong charge - spin coupling in the low - energy effective theory .",
    "these results suggest that if there is only one transition , the boi phase should disappear from the phase diagram .",
    "we mention here that in presence of electron - phonon interaction , the width of the boi phase increases and , in the adiabatic approximation , it replaces the mi phase.@xcite    from the above discussion , it is clear that the existence and extension of the boi phase in the electronic model deserves further study , particularly in the strong coupling limit , @xmath30 , since the arguments of fabrizio _ et al . _",
    "are not directly applicable .",
    "in addition , little attention has been given so far to the electric polarization or ferroelectric properties of the boi phase.@xcite the boi phase is an electronically induced peierls instability that generates a ferroelectric state .",
    "experimentally , a bond ordered ferroelectric state was observed in the pressure - temperature phase diagram of the prototype compound , tetrathiafulvalene-@xmath0-chloranil @xcite .",
    "in addition , as it was pointed out by egami _",
    "_ , @xcite the microscopic origin of the displacive - type ferroelectric transition in covalent perovskite oxides like batio@xmath31 is still unclear .",
    "it has been known for a long time that a picture based on static coulomb interactions and the simple shell model is inadequate to describe some ferroelectric properties.@xcite in a recent paper,@xcite using a spin - particle transformation,@xcite we mapped a hamiltonian which is close to the one obtained in the strong coupling limit of the ihm ( in a sense that will become clear in section iv ) into an anisotropic su(3 ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg model that becomes isotropic and exactly solvable in 1d for certain combinations of the parameters .",
    "the exact solution is a spontaneously dimerized boi that helps to understand the physics of the ihm in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the large value of the correlation length @xmath32 allows to understand the numerical difficulties for detecting this phase in finite size systems .",
    "we also used a second spin - particle transformation @xcite that maps the constrained fermions into @xmath33 su(2 ) spins and brings the effective model into a biquadratic heisenberg model with a spatial anisotropy along the @xmath34-axis which is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "this allows to interpret both transitions and the fractional charge excitations of the boi phase in the simple language of @xmath33 spins .    in this work ,",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian @xmath36 for the strong coupling limit of the extended ihm ( including @xmath37 and @xmath9 ) . as in the @xmath38 model",
    ", the single - site hilbert space of @xmath36 has three states . in two particular relevant cases @xmath36",
    "is mapped into simple models for @xmath33 su(2 ) spins .",
    "this opens the possibility of studying both quantum phase transitions in 1d with the quantum loop monte carlo technique which is specially designed to deal with criticality due to the non - local nature of its dynamics.@xcite harada and kawashima @xcite showed that this technique provides an accurate determination of the critical parameters of a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "the mapping to the exact solution @xcite is briefly reviewed .",
    "we discuss the polarization of the boi phase .",
    "in particular , we construct the bosonized expressions for the `` twist '' operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite which gives information on the conducting and polarization properties of the system , and are also related with the berry phases .",
    "this allows us to relate the polarization in the boi phase with the charge of its elementary excitations .",
    "in this section , we derive an effective hamiltonian for the extended ihm ( eihm ) valid for @xmath41 , but any value of @xmath2 if @xmath9 is small.@xcite for simplicity we restrict our study to 1d .",
    "the extension of this derivation to dimension higher than one is straightforward but somewhat cumbersome for @xmath42 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the eihm can be written in the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "this hamiltonian has four states per site : empty , doubly occupied , or singly occupied with spin up or down . at half filling and for @xmath10 , all odd sites ( those with energy @xmath47 )",
    "have at least one particle , and no even site is doubly occupied .",
    "thus , the relevant low - energy hilbert subspace @xmath48 has three states per site . our aim is to eliminate linear terms in @xmath1 which mix states of @xmath48 with the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "this can be done with a canonical transformation that leads to an effective hamiltonian @xmath36 which acts on @xmath49 and contains terms up to second order in @xmath1 .",
    "the procedure is completely standard ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to simplify the construction of @xmath36 , it is convenient to perform an electron - hole transformation for the odd sites @xmath50 the hamiltonian now becomes invariant under translation of one site ( @xmath51 ) but it does not conserve the number of particles due to the particle - hole transformation . the @xmath52 symmetry associated with the conservation of the total number of electrons is now generated by a the staggered charge operator @xmath53 .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian becomes    @xmath54    now , for @xmath55 but arbitrary @xmath56,@xcite we can eliminate the states with double occupancy on any site .",
    "this constraint can be incorporated to the fermionic algebra by defining the constrained fermion operators : @xmath57 performing a canonical transformation we eliminate the terms proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "these terms mix the low energy subspace @xmath48 with the orthogonal high - energy subspace @xmath58 , which consists of all the states having at least one doubly occupied site in this representation .",
    "up to second order in @xmath1 , we obtain the effective hamiltonian : @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the spin vector at site @xmath62 , the components of which are @xmath63 with @xmath64 ( @xmath65 are the pauli matrices ) .",

    "for instance , if we only keep the linear terms in @xmath1 , what amounts to neglect @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the resulting @xmath75 already contains the non - trivial charge fluctuations of the eihm near both transitions and is the minimal model to describe the system in the strong coupling limit .",

    "if the ihm is described to first order in @xmath1 , then @xmath221 becomes irrelevant and the question is if the boi survives after moving @xmath97 and @xmath9 from their values at the exact solution to zero .",
    "the results presented in sections ii and iii , indicate that increasing @xmath9 tends to close the boi phase , while increasing @xmath97 the effect is the opposite .",
    "the effect of small changes of @xmath97 , @xmath9 , and @xmath252 from the exactly solvable point on the energy of the dimer state , can be calculated by first order perturbation theory . in particular , because of the su(3 ) symmetry of the ground state , the ground state expectation value of @xmath253 , which is a projector over an su(2 ) singlet with two components , is 2/3 times the expectation value of the su(3 ) singlet with three components .",

    ", one obtains that @xmath262 when @xmath263 . for this value of @xmath252 ,",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) gives @xmath264 .",
    "since we know that @xmath265 @xmath266 and @xmath267 , this implies that the boi phase is still that of lowest energy in the strong coupling limit of the ihm if @xmath252 is decreased to @xmath268 .",
    "numerical results suggest that while this shift in @xmath252 is in the right direction , its magnitude is nearly two times smaller.@xcite",
    "in this section , we discuss the polarization and fractional charge excitations of the boi phase . to render the discussion clearer , we begin by calculating these properties in a perfectly dimerized state with the above mentioned su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "due to the breaking of z(2 ) symmetry , there are two such states as it is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . except for a trivial normalization constant ,",
    "one of them can be written as :    @xmath269    with @xmath270 ( the other ground state @xmath271 is obtained replacing the subscript @xmath272 by @xmath273 in the last two terms ) .",
    "@xmath274 is half the number of sites . using the definitions in section",
    "iv b and applying @xmath192 to our perfectly dimerized ground state @xmath275 we obtain :    @xmath276    in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath277 , the mean value of @xmath177 is :    @xmath278 this result implies a berry phase equal to @xmath279 .",
    "assuming as before that the polarization of the mi phase is zero ( @xmath280 modulo @xmath213 ) we have for the polarization @xmath281 , using eq .",
    "( [ berry ] ) with @xmath282 .",
    "this result has a simple interpretation : the ideal dimer state is composed of isolated `` diatomic molecules''and in this case @xmath185 coincides with the result for one molecule.@xcite in each molecule , 1/3 of the charge ( the weight of the first term in each factor of eq.([d1 ] ) ) has been displaced from site @xmath272 to @xmath283 , and since there is one molecule per two lattice parameters , the dipolar moment has increased by @xmath284 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    it is easy to generalize this result out of the su(3 ) symmetric point and for the other perfectly dimerized state .",
    "the result is ( modulo @xmath213 )    @xmath285    the factors that multiply @xmath212 express the weight of doubly occupied sites , i.e. , the sites with energy @xmath72 .",
    "note that as @xmath2 increases these factors decrease and they vanish when the system enters the mi phase . in the opposite limit",
    ", at the boundary with the ii phase or inside it , there is also only one value of the polarization @xmath286 since it is defined modulo @xmath213 . at this point , it is not possible to shift between two different polarized sates by application of an electric field and the system is not ferroelectric . only inside the boi phase one",
    "has ferroelectricity .    while we are unable to calculate the polarization in the ground state of the boi phase , our previous result eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) indicates that the result for the perfectly dimerized states eq .",
    "( [ polpe ] ) holds in the general case .",
    "the charge of the elementary excitations of the boi phase can be easily determined in the spin language.@xcite fig .",
    "2 shows a schematic representation of a spinon excitation in which the two possible ground states of the boi phase are separated by a spin 1 at a given site @xmath62 .",
    "this is not an eigenstate because the quantum fluctuations of the spin and the bond ordered regions are not included .",
    "however , the inclusion of these fluctuations does not change the charge of the soliton which is connecting both ground states . since the original charge operator can be written as @xmath287 , if @xmath288 ( representing either an empty site or a doubly occupied one ) , the total change in spin is zero , and the charge of the excitation is @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is any site . if instead @xmath291 , the spin of the excitation is 1/2 and its charge is @xmath292 .",
    "these results can be related with those of section iv b and are consistent with eqs .",

    "in summary , we have derived an effective low energy hamiltonian for the strong coupling regime of an extended ihm that includes a nearest - neighbor repulsion . using the spin - particle transformations introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , we mapped the effective hamiltonian into a spin one model .",
    "the spin language is useful to unveil hidden symmetries of the effective model for particular combinations of the different parameters .",
    "for instance , we showed that when the correlated hopping @xmath221 is neglected and the exchange term @xmath97 is treated as an independent parameter , the effective hamiltonian becomes a biquadratic heisenberg model with a single - ion anisotropy for @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of the single - ion anisotropy vanishes in the region dominated by the charge transfer instability : @xmath293 . at this point ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten as an su(3 ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg model using the general spin - particle transformations introduced in @xcite .",
    "the exact ground state of this model is a dimerized solution that corresponds to the boi in the original fermionic language . in the spin one language ,",
    "the low energy excitations of the dimerized solution are spinons .",
    "the @xmath294 spinons carry zero spin and charge @xmath295 in terms of the original fermions .",
    "the @xmath296 spinons have spin @xmath297 and charge @xmath298 in the original fermionic version . making @xmath299 changes the value of @xmath300 and @xmath301 continuously as a function of @xmath302 so the charge @xmath303 the solitons can also take irrational values .",
    "the above described results , which were obtained in the strong coupling limit , are in qualitative agreement with the weak coupling bosonization approach of fabrizio _",
    "et al_.@xcite the irrational values of the charge carried by each soliton are just a consequence of the asymmetry between the two sublattices introduced by the @xmath145 term.@xcite since these excitations have a topological nature , it is expected that their characteristics will not depend on the interaction regime .",
    "in addition , using the bosonization procedure we showed that the polarization of the ferroelectric boi is proportional to the charge @xmath165 of the elementary excitations ( solitons ) . therefore , the magnitude of the fractional charge carried by each soliton can be obtained experimentally by measuring the electric polarization of the ground state .",
