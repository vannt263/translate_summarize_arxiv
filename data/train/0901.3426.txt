    "why a talk on renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) in 2008 ?",
    "the consensus established in the 70 s under the acronym bphz is part of elementary particle physicists theoretical equipment .",
    "yet , the corresponding literature is hard to penetrate for a mind endowned with good logical connections - typically that of a professional mathematician .",
    "this state of affairs may be assigned , in parts , to some fuzziness about the connection between the operator version and the functional version (  la feynman ) of quantum mechanics , in this context .    in standard",
    "textbooks@xcite , the latter are both usually described in formal terms which are most of the time not subject to any mathematical formalization .",
    "parallel to the establishment of bphz , and following the path indicated by e.c.g .",
    "stueckelberg@xcite@xcite , n.n .",
    "bogoliubov@xcite and coworkers , h. epstein and v.  glaser @xcite have opened the road -also in the 70s- to such a mathematization .",
    "this path has been scarcely followed for the main following two reasons , as it seems :    * bphz has been found tight enough within the physics community mostly concerned with a large variety of interesting topics .",
    "* e.g.s constructions have remained beyond a fence which keeps their work isolated form concrete application of bphz , which rely on the algebraic structure of rpt mostly studied by z and coworkers@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the potentialities of eg have however been tested on classes of popular models -mostly gauge theories , abelian and non abelian- by g. scharf ( univ .",
    "fo zrich ) and coworkers@xcite@xcite .",
    "> from the philosophical point of view , eg as well as z ( and k. symanzik 1970 ) formulate rpt in a way that does not require the use -and removal- of regularizations , in much the same spirit as was adopted , in concrete cases , to derive properly substracted dispersion relations@xcite .",
    "one of the heroic founders of rpt , j. schwinger@xcite , was obviously attracted by such an approach which he baptized `` source theory '' -without realizing that eg had at least settled the question to all orders of rpt -as a means of curing the trauma caused by ( ultra - violet uv ) infinities .    to try and cut a long story short ,",
    "this program has diffused away from zrich ( where g. scharf has retired ) to hamburg and gttingen , under the joined leadership of michael dtsch ( abandoned by zrich ) and klaus fredenhagen , coworkers and students@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the road between eg and bphz has proved longer than expected .",
    "i will try to summarize some of what has been achieved for rpt on minkowski space ( which if a very small part of the whole ) .",
    "it is customary to start from fields whose equations of motion derive from a lagrangian .",
    "we will refrain from doing so a priori , because of the famous example of the free maxwell field , linear in the creation and annihilation operators for photons with two helicity states , as derived form wigner s representation of the poincar group for zero mass , helicity @xmath0 .",
    "the free maxwell equations    @xmath1    do not derive form a lagrangian .",
    "for algebraic reasons which will become manifest as we go along we shall however land very close to this restricted class of free fields .",
    "for what concerns us , these are wightman fields@xcite@xcite@xcite",
    ". we shall however give up the assumption that the fock space under consideration has a positive definite hilbert space metric -allowing for fields which have proven useful in the framework of gauge theories- .",
    "the connection between spin and statistics can then be jeopardized .",
    "given a finite set of free fields @xmath2 , the ( @xmath3 graded- ) commutative algebra @xmath4 of local wick polynomials of the field and their derivatives offers a quantum analog for the space of local interactions@xcite .",
    "`` as is well known''@xcite ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the algebra of local polynomials of similarly labelled classical fields and @xmath7 the ideal generated by the equations of motion fulfilled by @xmath2 .",
    "this `` well known '' fact has however to be taken with a grain of salt because , if @xmath2 is to take values in a representation space of @xmath8- with regard to lorentz covariance- or some `` internal '' compact global symmetry group @xmath9 , @xmath6 itself comes as a quotient of @xmath10 ( free algebra generated by monomials @xmath11 [ eg ] s supermultiquadriindices ) by an ideal of relations fulfilled by monomials @xmath12    for instance @xmath13 is generated by the relations which express the linear dependence of three vectors in 2-dimensional space@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17    this caveat will take its strength from linearity , resp .",
