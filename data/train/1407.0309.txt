    "we have seen how , in the large-@xmath39 limit , at analytical models and nat numerical calculations converge to the same result in the case of regular rectangular lattices .",

    ", this behavior may be expected also for nat at small degrees of deformation . but how does at perform in more realistic and disordered cases where the initial particle distribution can be irregular ? to answer this question we will consider the difference @xmath60 , the elastic modulus numerically calculated with at and nat , at @xmath40 , for different and increasingly randomized lattices .",
    "we have considered a rectangular lattice with diagonal springs , a hexagonal lattice with horizontal rows of nearest neighbor springs , one with vertical rows , and a honeycomb lattice with springs beyond nearest neighbors ( as depicted in fig .",

    "[ g_x_rand ] , we plot the relative difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    already for the regular lattices of vanishing randomization @xmath68 , we find a relative deviation of @xmath34 from @xmath35 in the one - digit per - cent regime .",
    "this deviation is smallest for the regular rectangular lattice , where the principal stretching directions are parallel to the nearest - neighbor bond vectors .",
    "the deviation for @xmath68 increases when we consider instead the hexagonal and honeycomb lattices . obviously , and this is our main point here , the relative difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 increases for each lattice that we investigated with the degree of randomization @xmath67 .",
    "therefore nat find much lower equilibrium states with increasing randomization , and at lead to erroneous results .",
    "we will now consider a non - vanishing magnetic moment @xmath69 .",
    "this is parallel to the direction in which we apply the strain in order to measure the elastic modulus . as we will see below ,",
    "the behavior of the elastic modulus as a function of the magnetic moment @xmath36 strongly depends on the orientation of @xmath4 and on the lattice structure .",
    "the kind of magnetic interaction between nearest neighbors is fundamental for its impact on the elastic modulus . on the one hand ,",

    "when @xmath4 is parallel to the strain direction @xmath29 , the magnetic interaction along @xmath29 is attractive and , for @xmath24 large enough , will cause the lattice to shrink and the elastic modulus to decrease . for some cases , though , @xmath36 shows an initial increasing trend .",
    "this happens when in the unstrained lattice the particles are much closer in @xmath72 than in @xmath29 .",
    "then , for small deformations , magnetic repulsion is prevalent and the magnetic contribution to @xmath25 is positive , as can be seen from fig .",

    "although the minimal analytical model can predict the existence of a threshold value for @xmath74 it would need the magnetic contribution of more than only nearest neighbor particles to be more accurate , since the magnetic interaction is long ranged ( whereas the elastic interaction acts only on nearest neighbors ) .",
    "in this orientation of the magnetic moment , the hexagonal lattice case is exemplary , because it shows very well the orientational structural dependence of @xmath36 .    on the one hand , for the hexagonal lattice",
