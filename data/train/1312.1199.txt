    "two compact objects ( black hole - neutron star or neutron star - neutron star ) in a binary system will undergo orbital decay due to gravitational radiation emission and eventually merge .",
    "the merger is thought to produce a larger , central compact object surrounded by a rapidly accreting torus of debris .",
    "the debris torus may contribute to the energy needed to power a short - duration gamma - ray burst @xcite .",
    "some fraction of the mass of the system is expected to be ejected  promptly , in the tidal tails , and in outflows from the accretion disk .",
    "thus merger events are expected to be important contributors to galactic nucleosynthesis .",
    "understanding the nature of this contribution requires accurate predictions of the elemental composition of the ejected material .",
    "additionally , the decay of nuclear species produced in the merger will result in an observable electromagnetic counterpart @xcite , which will be sensitive to the kinds and amounts of radioactive species produced @xcite .",
    "the material ejected promptly or in the tidal tails is expected to be cold or only mildly heated and to retain much of the neutron richness of the original neutron star(s ) .",
    "thus it is an attractive site for the assembly of the heaviest elements in rapid neutron capture , or r - process , nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the material that makes up the accretion disk outflows , on the other hand , will be highly processed before element synthesis occurs  first in the disk @xcite , where it is heated and the nuclei dissociated into their constituent nucleons , and then in the outflow @xcite , where the composition will be set by the weak interactions : @xmath1 as the accretion disk copiously emits neutrinos @xcite , the above reverse reactions play a key role in determining the resulting element synthesis in the outflows .    element synthesis in the hot outflows from merger - type black hole accretion disks has previously been addressed in , e.g. , @xcite . these found neutron - rich outflows to be possible in this environment , and thus suggested that merger - type disk winds may be an important source of particularly the lighter r - process nuclei .",
    "in general neutron - rich outflows may result from two distinct mechanisms : the preservation of the high disk neutron - to - proton ratio in the outflow or the reset of the outflow neutron - to - proton ratio by the neutrino capture reactions from eqns .",
    "the latter mechanism is the focus of this work . for the neutrino interactions to drive the outflows neutron - rich",
    ", the antineutrinos must be sufficiently hotter than the neutrinos to overcome the neutron - proton mass difference , so that the rate of antineutrino captures on protons can exceed the neutrino capture rate on neutrons .",
    "calculations of disk neutrino decoupling surfaces , similar to protoneutron star ( pns ) ` neutrinospheres ' , show that as in the pns the antineutrinos decouple deeper within the disk and are therefore hotter .",
    "however , the decoupling surfaces are not spherical as in the pns but torus - shaped , so the antineutrinos emerge from a smaller region closer to the black hole .",
    "this makes the antineutrinos subject to larger general relativistic effects @xcite and reduces the expected neutron richness of any neutrino - dominated outflows @xcite .",
    "here we address an additional consideration  does the disk neutrino emission persist long enough to make robustly neutron - rich outflows ?",
    "we consider the nucleosynthesis in the outflows from a time - dependent merger - type black hole accretion disk , carefully incorporating the important general relativistic effects on the neutrino emission from the disk .",
    "we find that the mechanism for producing neutron - rich disk outflows via neutrino interactions does not operate in this model . instead , mildly proton - rich outflows are predicted .",
    "we examine the resulting nucleosynthesis and show these outflows can result in significant @xmath0ni production .",
    "along the trajectory , where black corresponds to @xmath2=0 and white corresponds to @xmath2=1 . ]",
    "we begin with a time - dependent model of a merger - type black hole accretion disk .",
    "the initial disk model is set up to be the equilibrium configuration of a constant angular momentum torus , similar to @xcite , where the black hole has a mass of 3 solar masses and spin parameter of @xmath3 .",
    "the simulated physics are newtonian , except for the gravitational potential , which is given by the pseudo - relativistic artemova - novikov - bjoernsson potential @xcite .",
    "the equation of state takes into account non - relativistic baryons ( neutrons , protons , alphas , and one heavy nucleus ) , relativistic and/or degenerate electrons , and a plasma , and is similar to @xcite . at @xmath4",
    "s the shakura and sunyaev alpha viscosity terms are turned on and the subsequent disk dynamics are followed .",
    "we take two time snapshots of this accretion disk model , at @xmath5 ms and @xmath6 ms , for careful study .",
    "the first time snapshot is representative of the disk just after formation and corresponds to conditions similar to those from , for example , @xcite .",
    "we consider outflows launched from this disk at @xmath5 ms . as the outflowing material moves away from the disk",
    ", it will continue to be affected by the neutrino emission from the evolving disk .",
    "thus , we use a second disk snapshot to capture the general behavior of the time evolution of the disk neutrino emission .",
    "the neutrino interactions are the most important during the early part of the outflow , within the first tens of milliseconds from launch , so we choose @xmath6 ms for the second snapshot .",
    "for each disk snapshot , we calculate the electron neutrino and antineutrino decoupling surfaces as in @xcite and take the neutrino emission to be thermal , with a temperature equal to the local disk temperature at the point of decoupling .",
    "the neutrino decoupling surfaces for the two disk snapshots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] .",
    "at early times , both the electron neutrino and antineutrino decoupling surfaces are large , and the antineutrinos emerge from deeper within the disk and are therefore hotter . by @xmath6",
    "ms , the disk has already lost enough mass to substantively change its structure  neutrino emission drops and the neutrino decoupling surfaces shrink .",
    "these changes to the neutrino emitting regions will strongly impact the resulting nucleosynthesis in the outflows .",
    "to study the nucleosynthesis produced in hot outflows from this disk , we use an outflow model based on a streamline approach . we construct the model by first constraining the outflow to follow radial streamlines with zero vorticity .",
    "we use the steady flow approximation and consider the bernoulli function along the streamline that defines the outflow trajectory . in its simplest form ,",
    "the bernoulli function is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the outflow velocity , @xmath9 is the specific enthalpy , and @xmath10 is the gravitational potential with @xmath11 the black hole mass , @xmath12 the distance to the black hole of a mass element , and @xmath13 the gravitational constant .",
    "we write the specific enthalpy as @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the density , @xmath16 is the temperature , @xmath17 is the baryon number density , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the number density and chemical potential , respectively , of species @xmath20 , where the sum over species includes electrons , positrons , neutrons , protons , alpha particles , and an average heavy nucleus@xcite .",
    "we solve for the outflow hydrodynamics by further assuming a constant mass outflow rate , @xmath21 , which remains a free parameter in this formulation .",
    "as in @xcite , we choose to follow adiabatic trajectories and take the bernoulli function to be constant along the streamline .",
    "the resulting trajectories , parameterized in entropy and mass outflow rate , are qualitatively similar to standard supernova neutrino - driven wind trajectories @xcite , parameterized in entropy and dynamic timescale @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , so we adopt the latter prescription .",
    "we launch material from the inner region of the disk , at @xmath5 ms and @xmath24 km ; a schematic of the trajectory is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem ] .",
    "we take the starting composition of the outflow to be the local @xmath5 ms disk composition at that point , which is a mix of neutrons and protons with an electron fraction @xmath25 of 0.446 .",
    "we then evolve the composition , taking careful account of the weak reactions eqns .",
    "1,2 throughout .     along a sample radial outflow trajectory for the @xmath5 ms ( thick red lines ) and the @xmath6 ms ( thin purple lines ) disk model snapshots , with ( solid ) and without ( dot - dashed ) gr effects on the neutrino fluxes .",
    "the outflow electron fractions obtained in the full calculation , starting from the disk value of 0.446 , tend to fall in between , as shown here for a @xmath26 , @xmath27 ms outflow trajectory ( dotted line ) . ]    of particular importance are the neutrino capture reactions on nucleons , eqns .",
    "the rates of these reactions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32kev@xmath33 , @xmath34 is the electron mass , @xmath35 is the neutron - proton mass difference , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the weak magnetism corrections @xcite and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the effective neutrino and antineutrino fluxes in units of 1/(@xmath32s@xmath40kev ) .",
    "the effective neutrino and antineutrino fluxes as observed by the outflowing fluid element above each disk snapshot are calculated as in @xcite .",
    "we integrate the thermal fluxes described in sec .  2 above over the solid angle of the emitting surface , both with and without general relativistic ( gr ) corrections to the neutrino energies and trajectories .",
    "the neutrino and antineutrino capture rates are then calculated from each set of these fluxes along the radial outflow path .    to get a sense of",
    "what type of nucleosynthesis we can expect as well as the impact of the gr effects and the time - dependence of the neutrino fluxes , we examine the neutrino - only equilibrium electron fraction along the radial outflow path , calculated separately for the @xmath5 ms and @xmath6 ms disk snapshots . the neutrino - only equilibrium electron fraction , @xmath41 , is the composition that would be expected if the neutrino interaction rates are much greater than the reverse weak rates of electron / positron capture , and is calculated by @xmath42 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ye ] .",
    "we can see that if the @xmath5 ms disk snapshot were taken to be steady - state and the gr effects on the neutrino spectra are ignored , the outflows would tend to be driven neutron rich by neutrino interactions .",
    "however , once the gr effects are included , the situation changes , as first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the antineutrinos come from a smaller emitting surface closer to the black hole than the neutrinos , and so the antineutrino fluxes are more strongly shaped by the gr effects , particularly the redshifting of the neutrino energies .",
    "thus at the start of the trajectory the strong neutron - richness predicted in the no - gr @xmath41 is lost . by @xmath6",
    "ms , the antineutrino emitting surface has become so small that , even though the antineutrinos are still hotter than the neutrinos , the material along the outflow trajectory ` sees ' more neutrinos than antineutrinos , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the effects of the time dependence of the neutrino fluxes are estimated by a simple linear scheme .",
    "the outflow is launched at @xmath5 ms , and from @xmath5 ms to @xmath6 ms the neutrino capture rates are taken to be @xmath45 and for @xmath46 ms @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the interaction rates calculated with the @xmath5 ms and @xmath6 ms disk neutrino fluxes , respectively .",
    "this choice of an interpolation scheme captures the general features of the time dependence of the neutrino fluxes and should influence only the details of the predicted nucleosynthetic yields and not the general conclusions .",
    "using the neutrino interaction rates described above , we follow the element synthesis as in @xcite , first with an nse calculation @xcite and then switching over to a full nuclear network @xcite at @xmath50 gk .",
    "we examine a range of our outflow parameter space : entropies @xmath51 and effective dynamic timescales 10 ms@xmath52 ms .",
    "as anticipated , the actual evolution of the electron fraction in the outflow tends to lie somewhere in between the @xmath41 values for the two disk snapshots , as shown for an example full trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : ye ] . as a result",
    ", we find proton - rich nucleosynthesis products in almost all of the outflows studied .     and effective dynamic timescale @xmath22sampled in this work .",
    "the shaded regions correspond to nickel mass fractions of 0.5 , 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.1 , and less than 0.1 , from darkest to lightest . ]",
    "the nucleus with @xmath53 most vigorously produced is @xmath0ni .",
    "the final mass fractions of nickel in the outflows are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ni ] . for mildly heated outflow material over half",
    "is ejected as @xmath0ni .",
    "increases in heating tend to favor lighter nuclei , and so for trajectories with higher entropy most of the material is left as alpha particles . still , @xmath0ni remains the most abundantly produced @xmath53 nucleus .",
    "note that the prediction of nickel - rich outflows for this disk model depends strongly on the neutrino physics and is largely insensitive to the particular outflow parameterization chosen .",
    "we draw the same conclusions regarding @xmath0ni production when we repeat the nucleosynthesis calculations using the outflow model from @xcite .",
    "merger - type black hole accretion disks have been shown to be attractive potential sites for neutron - rich nucleosynthesis . here",
    "we examine one potential mechanism for producing neutron - rich outflows  via neutrino interactions in the outflow  and note that its operation is not ubiquitous . in our calculations , we find that the combination of general relativistic effects on the neutrino fluxes as well as the rapid evolution of the neutrino emission surfaces have the opposite effect .",
    "the resulting proton - rich outflows will not produce r - process nuclei but may be a rich source of @xmath0ni .",
    "any @xmath0ni produced will decay first into @xmath0co then @xmath0fe .",
    "such decays power the light curves of core - collapse supernovae and so could potentially produce an observable electromagentic counterpart to the merger event . if @xmath54 of the disk mass is ejected in winds that are driven proton - rich by the neutrino physics , on the order of @xmath55 of @xmath0ni may be ejected .",
    "this is sufficient to generate a bright optical peak @xcite , which would be in addition to the infrared peak expected to be due to the radioactive r - process ejecta @xcite .",
