    "the initial condition can be understood in the sense of definition 2.2 in @xcite .      to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the model given in has only been studied in the case that @xmath63 , and @xmath64 by ackleh - deng @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the main equation was only linear .",
    "more precisely , the authors studied the following .",
    "@xmath65 ackleh - deng @xcite proved that if @xmath66 , then there is @xmath51 such that possesses a unique local solution @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that ( large ) solutions with negative initial energy blow - up if @xmath68 and are global otherwise .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 was considered the critical exponent for .",
    "obtaining local existence and uniqueness consisted of two steps .",
    "first , the authors studied the linear schrdinger equation with an inhomogeneous neumann boundary condition on the half - line .",
    "secondly , they used a contraction argument once the representation formula for solutions was restricted to the boundary point @xmath70 . in other words , the contraction argument was used on a function space which included only time dependent elements .",
    "unfortunately , the same technique can not be applied in the presence of the nonlinear source term @xmath71 in the main equation .",
    "the reason is that even if the representation formula can still be restricted to the point @xmath70 , the sought after fixed point in the representation formula would also depend on the space variable .",
    "therefore , one can no longer use a simple contraction argument on a function space which includes only time dependent elements .",
    "we are thus motivated to use a contraction argument on a function space which includes elements that depend on both time and space variables .",
    "of course , this requires nice linear and nonlinear space - time estimates .",
    "the drawback of the technique used in @xcite is that the initial data has been assumed to be too smooth compared to the regularity of the solutions obtained .",
    "it is well - known from the theory of the linear schrdinger equation that solutions are of the same class as the initial state . from this point of view",
    ", the generation of @xmath72 solutions with @xmath73 data seems far from optimal .",
    "we are thus inclined to obtain a regularity theory which shows that @xmath23 initial data generates @xmath23 solutions .    regarding nonlinear boundary conditions , we are aware of very few other results for schrdinger equations , see for example @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the schrdinger equation with nonlinear , attractive , and dissipative boundary conditions of type @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a monotone function with the property that the corresponding evolution operator generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on the @xmath4-level .",
    "the more recent paper @xcite studies schrdinger equation with wentzell boundary conditions .",
    "this work also uses the fact that the wentzell boundary condition provide a semigroup in an appropriate topology . in the present case , due to the fact that @xmath18 is not a purely imaginary number ,",
    "the problem does not have a monotone structure , and the method of @xcite , @xcite can not be applied here .",
    "a common strategy for proving well - posedness of solutions to pdes with nonlinear terms relies on two classical steps : ( 1 ) obtain a good linear theory with non - homogeneous terms ; ( 2 ) establish local well - posedness for the nonlinear model by a fixed point argument .    obtaining a good linear theory with non - homogeneous terms is a subtle point for boundary value problems , especially those with low - regularity boundary data .",
    "one might attempt to extend the boundary data into the domain and homogenize the boundary condition .",
    "however , this approach in general requires a high regularity boundary data ( @xcite , @xcite ) , as opposed to the rough boundary situation as in the present paper for low values of @xmath42 .",
    "there are different approaches one can follow to study a linear pde with an inhomogeneous boundary data on the half - line without employing an extension - homogenization approach , though .",
    "for example , colliander - kenig @xcite used a technique on the kdv equation by replacing the given initial - boundary value problem with a forced initial value problem where the forcing is chosen in such a way that the boundary condition is satisfied by inverting a riemann - liouville fractional integral .",
    "holmer @xcite applied this technique on nonlinear schrdinger equations with inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on the half line .",
    "a second approach is to obtain norm estimates on solutions by using a representation formula , which can be easily obtained through a laplace / fourier transform .",
    "this technique has been used for example by kaikina in @xcite for nonlinear schrdinger equations with inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions and by bona - sun - zhang in @xcite for inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions . in @xcite ,",
    "the well - posedness result assumes the smallness of the given initial - boundary data while the results of @xcite have global character in this sense .",
    "although nonlinear schrdinger equations with inhomogeneous boundary conditions have been studied to some extent , most of these papers were devoted to inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are relatively less results on inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "well - posedness is obtained under smooth boundary data .",
    "relatively less smooth boundary data was treated in @xcite using strichartz estimates , but the regularity results were not optimal . in @xcite ,",
    "the smallness of initial and boundary data was crucial . in @xcite ,",
    "the focus was on the existence of weak solutions , and questions concerning continuity in time , uniqueness , and continuous dependence on data were not studied . in the present paper , we draw a more complete and optimal well - posedness picture where the spatial domain is half - line .      in this paper",
    ", we will follow a step - by - step approach to prove theorem [ mainprob ] :    _ step 1 _ : we will first study the linear schrdinger equation with inhomogeneous terms both in the main equation and in the boundary condition . this problem is written in . our aim in this step is to derive optimal norm estimates with respect to regularities of the initial state @xmath20 , boundary data @xmath76 , and nonhomogeneous source term @xmath77 .",
    "this linear theory is constructed in section [ sectionlin ] by adapting the method of @xcite to nonhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions .",
    "_ step 2 _ : in the second step , we will replace the nonhomogeneous source term @xmath78 in with @xmath79 as in .",
    "we will use a contraction mapping argument to prove the existence and uniqueness of local solutions together with continuous dependence on data .",
    "the blow - up alternative will be obtained via a classical extension - contradiction argument .",
    "this step is treated in sections [ locext ] - [ blowsec ] .",
    "_ step 3 _ : in this step , we will replace the boundary data @xmath80 in with @xmath81 , and @xmath77 with @xmath82 .",
    "arguments similar to those in step 2 will eventually give the well - posedness in the presence of nonlinear boundary conditions .",
    "the only difference is that the contraction argument must be adapted to deal with the nonlinear effects due to the nonlinear boundary source .",
    "this is given in section [ sectionnonlin2 ] .",
    "step 2 is indeed optional .",
    "one can directly run the contraction and blow - up arguments with nonlinear boundary conditions .",
    "however , it is useful to include the general theory of nonlinear schrdinger equations with inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions to study other related problems in the future .",
    "in this section , we study the nonhomogeneous linear schrdinger equation with nonhomogeneous neumann boundary condition",
    ". we will later apply this linear theory to obtain the local well - posedness for nonlinear schrdinger equations first with inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions and then with nonlinear boundary conditions . in order to obtain a sufficiently nice linear theory ,",
    "we adapt the method presented for nonhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions in @xcite to the case with nonhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we consider the following linear model @xmath83 where @xmath77 and @xmath76 lie in appropriate function spaces .",
    "suppose @xmath84 , @xmath8 in .",
    "it is well - known from the trace theory that both @xmath33 and @xmath85 make sense when @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , one needs to assume the zeroth order compatibility condition @xmath86 when @xmath87 in order to get continuous solutions at @xmath35 .",
    "as the value of @xmath42 gets higher , one needs to consider more compatibility conditions .",
    "for example , if @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , then the @xmath90-th order compatibility condition is defined inductively : @xmath91 @xmath92 provided that @xmath77 is also smooth enough for traces to make sense .",
    "if one wants to add the end point cases @xmath93 to the analysis , then _ global compatibility conditions _ must be assumed ( see for example @xcite for a discussion of local and global compatibility conditions in the case of dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "we will first deduce a representation formula for solutions of the following linear model with an inhomogeneity on the boundary .",
    "@xmath94    we will study the above model by constructing an evolution operator which acts on the boundary data",
    ". we will start by taking a laplace ( in time ) - fourier ( in space ) transform of the given model . in order to do that",
