    ", we can construct a wavefunction supported on all white sites . for it to be a zero - mode",
    ", the schrdinger equation must also be satisfied on the two rightmost black sites that were not used to propagate the wavefunction on the white sites . for fig .",
    "[ fig : 3 exs of lattice with neq bc](b ) these are the two rightmost black sites .",
    "application of schrdinger equation on each of those sites yields two linear constraints for the wavefunction elements on the rightmost white sites .",
    "both constraints can be satisfied since they are implemented linearly on the three seeds of the wavefunction on the left end .",
    "this example suggests a three - step recursive method to obtain zero - modes .",
    "first , the zero - mode has support on one sublattice only .",
    "second , @xmath27 independent numbers that make up the @xmath27component vector @xmath69 are assigned to the values taken by the wavefunction on the leftmost sites of each row that belong to sublattice @xmath12 .",
    "solution of the schrdinger equation on all sites of sublattice @xmath13 except for those without a white nearest - neighbor to their left or right ( i.e. , except for sites of sublattice @xmath13 that are at the left or right ends of a row ) allows to propagate recursively the wavefunction to the right column by column .",

( [ eq : averaged x_n ] ) and ( [ eq : xin ] ) above .",
