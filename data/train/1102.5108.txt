    "the subdivision of electronic states into delocalized , itinerant , and localized , strongly correlated states is one of the most fundamental ones in the description of solids .",
    "crudely , delocalized states exist when the intersite electron hopping is larger than the typical electron ",
    "electron interaction energy , and localized states exist in the opposite limit . in quantum chemistry",
    "these two limits correspond e.g.  to the description of electrons in terms of molecular orbitals ( mulliken description , known in chemistry as molecular orbital  linear combination of atomic orbitals ( mo  lcao ) method ) , and strongly correlated electrons are described by the heitler  london approximation . for concentrated solids",
    "these two regimes give either standard band systems ( metals or semiconductors ) , or mott insulators .",
    "the electron  electron repulsion , e.g.  the hubbard s @xmath0 , is essentially an atomic property and does not depend on interatomic distance , whereas the electron hopping strongly depends on this distance .",
    "this leads to the concept , largely advocated e.g.  by goodenough @xcite , that there should exist a critical interatomic distance  @xmath1 ( different for different transition metal ( tm ) ions ) dividing the regions of localized and itinerant behaviour of electrons .",
    "when this distance changes , e.g.  under pressure , there should occur an insulator  metal ( mott ) transition .",
    "usually mott transition in tm compounds such as tm oxides is supposed to occur homogeneously in the whole sample .",
    "but , as became clear recently , this is not the only possibility .",
    "there may appear novel , inhomogeneous states close to a mott transition , so that we have , in a sense , a `` partial '' mott transition : in some parts of the system , in some particular clusters , the interatomic distances may already be smaller than @xmath1 , so that these clusters may be better described using molecular orbitals , whereas the distance _ between _ such clusters will still remain large , so that there will be no net metallic conductivity .",
    "the formation of such `` metallic '' clusters has much in common with the valence bond solids .",
    "this phenomenon , i.e.  such `` fractional '' mott transition , is most often observed in low - dimensional and in frustrated systems .",
    "indeed , in regular three - dimensional lattices such as perovskites we usually have homogeneous ordered states , e.g.  3d antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "molecular - type clusters such as valence bond states are much more plausible in low - dimensional and frustrated systems .",
    "below i will describe this situation using several specific examples of systems with triangular and pyrochlore ( spinel ) lattices , and also on some quasi - one - dimensional systems .",
    "i will also shortly mention some other possible novel phenomena , which may appear in systems close to the localized ",
    "itinerant crossover .",
    "metal  insulator transitions with the formation of unusual structures are observed in many spinels .",
    "the recent examples are mgti_2o_4 ] @xcite , cuir_2s_4 ] @xcite or alv_2o_4 ]  @xcite .",
    "structural studies have shown that in all these cases rather unusual structural modifications take place , which often can be described as the formation of molecular clusters . in mgti_2o_4 ] there appears a `` chiral '' structure @xcite , in cuir_2s_4 ] ir octamers are formed @xcite , but both these phenomena can in fact be explained by the formation of ti or ir _ singlet dimers _ , which in a frustrated lattice of @xmath2-sites of a spinel finally give rise to these chiral or octamer structures  @xcite . and in alv_2o_4 ] the molecular clusters formed consist of 7 vanadiums  real large `` heptamer molecules '' .",
    "electrons in a lattice of @xmath2-sites of a spinel .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals are shown . ]    in all these cases the formation of these clusters is largely caused by specific features of the @xmath2-site spinel lattice , which may be represented as a collection of 1d chains running in @xmath3 ( or @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath4 directions , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the @xmath7-orbitals of ti or v ions on this lattice have a strong direct @xmath8@xmath8 overlap , such that e.g.the electrons from the @xmath3-orbitals can hop to the same orbitals in neighbouring ions in the @xmath3-direction , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , or similarly @xmath4-electrons can hop in the @xmath4-direction , etc . as a result",
    "the electronic structure in these , basically cubic crystals , has essentially one - dimensional character .",
    "and in the insulating phase one forms a peierls state with singlet dimers in these 1d chains  @xcite , which for a spinel lattice give the chiral structure in mgti_2o_4 ] , the heptamers in alv_2o_4 ] and octamers ( consisting actually of dimers ) in cuir_2s_4 ] .",
    "note that the interatomic distances in these clusters are rather short : they are shorter than the critical distance @xmath1 for the localized  itinerant crossover  @xcite , so that one can consider the electronic state in these clusters as forming molecular orbitals , i.e.  in these clusters we are already on the `` metallic '' side of the mott transition .",
    "but the distance _ between _ these clusters is larger than @xmath1 and as a result the total compound is insulating .",
    "the `` metallic '' clusters in the examples discussed above are singlet .",
    "but this is not the only possibility .",
    "magnetic ( e.g.  triplet ) clusters can also be formed in some cases .",
    "this seems to happen in znv_2o_4 ]  @xcite .",
    "v spinels such as mgv_2o_4 ] , znv_2o_4 ] , cdv_2o_4 ] show cubic  tetragonal structural transitions  @xcite with the formation of a very specific magnetic structure at lower temperatures , with @xmath9 pattern in @xmath6- and @xmath4-chains ( and with @xmath10 ordering in the @xmath3-direction )  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "usually the properties of these systems are explained by some type of orbital ordering : the @xmath3-orbitals are always occupied due to tetragonal distortion with @xmath11 , and the remaining second @xmath7 electron of the v^3+](@xmath12 ) ions is supposed to form an additional orbital ordering of some type  @xcite .",
    "but our recent ab  initio calculations  @xcite have shown that there should exist in znv_2o_4 ] a v dimerization in @xmath6- and @xmath4-chains , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , with , surprisingly , ferromagnetic bonds becoming shorter ( thick bonds in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) !",
    "one can explain this tendency by noticing that , in contrast to most examples of valence bond solids with singlet bonds , here we are dealing not with ions with one electron with @xmath13 , but with @xmath12 ions with  @xmath14 .",
    "one can argue that the extra delocalization of one of two electrons in a short bond enhances the ferromagnetic ( actually double - exchange ) interaction between these @xmath12 , @xmath14 ions .",
    "the ab  initio calculations of another material of this family , cdv_2o_4 ] , done by a different method , have confirmed the formation of these dimers , and demonstrated , in addition , that their formation can lead to the appearance of ferroelectricity , which was indeed observed in cdv_2o_4 ]  @xcite .    , following @xcite ; the same pattern also exists in cdv_2o_4 ] @xcite . ]",
    "interestingly enough , short v ",
    "v distances obtained theoretically for znv_2o_4 ] are only @xmath15   again shorter than the critical v ",
    "v distance @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "thus again these v dimers may be considered as `` metallic '' , though the material itself remains insulating , albeit with a rather small energy gap @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "some more examples of `` metallic '' clusters in an overall insulating matrix are found in layered materials , notably with triangular lattices , such as livo_2 ] @xcite , livs_2 ] @xcite , tii_2 ]  @xcite .",
    "this lattice is usually considered as frustrated , meaning that it is not bipartite .",
    "but in livo_2 ] , livs_2 ] , tii_2 ] we are dealing with ions ti^2 + ] , v^3 + ] with two @xmath7 @xmath8-electrons , which , besides spin , have also triple orbital degeneracy . and",
    ", if one can not subdivide a triangular lattice into two sublattices , one can naturally subdivide it into three !",
    "that is indeed what happens in these materials @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , in which the occupied orbitals are shown . after forming this orbital superstructure",
    ", we have strong antiferromagnetic exchange in the shaded triangles of fig .  [ fig:3 ] , and in effect",
    "these bonds become shorter than the others , and there are singlet states formed _ on such trimers _ ( three @xmath14 ions with strong antiferromagnetic coupling have a singlet ground state with @xmath18 ) .",
    "our recent detailed ab  initio calculations @xcite confirmed this picture and gave a strong antiferromagnetic exchange in a trimer , the exchange interaction between trimers being much weaker and ferromagnetic .",
    "lattice optimization gave v  v distances in a trimer of @xmath19 , in good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "note that in this case the short distance in a cluster  here a trimer  is even shorter than the v ",
    "v distance in v metal , @xmath20 , i.e.  these clusters can indeed be considered as `` metallic '' .     with three orbital sublattices , leading to the formation of spin singlet states on tightly bound v triangles (",
    "shaded ) , following @xcite . ]",
    "if however we increase the total lattice parameter , which we can do e.g.  by going from livo_2 ] to navo_2 ] , the situation changes drastically . as shown in @xcite , the orbital ordering in navo_2 ]",
    "is quite different from that in livo_2 ] : only two types of orbitals are occupied , see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . as a result ,",
    "after such orbital ordering the system becomes topologically a square lattice , and as such it can develop the ordinary nel magnetic ordering , which it actually does .",
    "note also that , in contrast to livo_2 ] , in navo_2 ] the bonds with strong orbital overlap become _ not shorter , but longer _ !",
    "one can explain this as a competition of two effects : stronger covalency tends to make such bonds shorter , but the bond  charge repulsion ( coulomb repulsion of electron clouds on orbitals directed towards each other ) would tend to make such bonds longer . apparently when the system has a relatively small lattice parameter , or small average tm ",
    "tm distance , i.e.  when the system is close to the localized ",
    "itinerant crossover , the hybridization is rather strong , and the first effect , the tendency to increase it still further , prevails , so that such bonds become even shorter ; this is what happens in livo_2 ] and livs_2 ] . if , however , the system has localized @xmath8-electrons and is far from the mott transition , the @xmath8@xmath8 overlap is exponentially small , and the second effect , the bond ",
    "charge repulsion , may become stronger , as a result of which it is favourable to make such bonds longer , to reduce this repulsion further .",
    "this is apparently what happens in navo_2 ] .",
    "@xcite . ]    until now we saw the formation of different types of tm clusters , mostly singlet ones : dimers ( mgti_2o_4 ] , cuir_2s_4 ] ) , trimers ( livo_2 ] , livs_2 ] , tii_2 ] ) , or larger clusters such as heptamers in alv_2o_4 ] .",
    "also singlet tetramers can be formed , especially in layered materials .",
    "one such example is cav_4o_9 ] @xcite , with the interesting `` chiral '' lattice , in which the singlets are formed by four v ions around an `` empty '' plaquette . in all these cases either low - dimensionality or the frustrated nature of the lattice apparently plays an important role . as mentioned above , valence bond solids are indeed especially easily formed in frustrated or quasi - one - dimensional systems  this is in fact the essence of the peierls phenomena .",
    "a very clear example of this phenomenon , in particular its features close to the localized ",
    "itinerant crossover , is observed in tiocl .",
    "this quasi - one - dimensional material is insulating with localized @xmath8-electrons at ambient pressure , and it has a spin - peierls transition at @xmath21 ( with an incommensurate phase at @xmath22 ) . under pressure",
    "its energy gap strongly decreases , and it approaches an insulator ",
    "metal transition at  @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "however direct dc resistivity measurements have shown @xcite that tiocl actually remains insulating even for @xmath24 , at least up to @xmath25 , albeit with a smaller gap .",
    "surprisingly , ab  initio calculations with lattice optimisation have shown @xcite that in the high - pressure phase , in which indeed the energy gap strongly decreases , the ti ",
    "ti dimerization itself does not decrease but _ increases _ instead , see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] !        a qualitative explanation can be obtained , using again the idea of the proximity of this material to the localized  itinerant crossover . at @xmath26",
    "the @xmath8-electrons are localized , and we have a spin - peierls transition , with @xmath27 and with the degree of dimerization @xmath28 proportional to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the exchange interaction , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the spin  phonon coupling constant .",
    "note that the energy gap in this regime is still of the mott ",
    "hubbard type , i.e.  it is large , @xmath33 . under pressure",
    "tiocl approaches the insulator ",
    "metal transition , as observed in  @xcite .",
    "but after crossing to the itinerant regime , the system still `` knows '' that it is one - dimensional , and as such it has a peierls instability , with @xmath27 ( @xmath34degree of dimerization@xmath35energy gap ) @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the electron ",
    "electron coupling constant in this regime .",
    "that is , the very nature of insulating state in this regime is _ due to peierls dimerization _ , and is not of mott insulator type . but",
    "the dimerization is in this regime proportional to the bandwidth , or the hopping matrix element  @xmath38 , and not to @xmath31 .",
    "thus apparently we have here , simultaneously with the localized  itinerant crossover , also a spin - peierls  peierls transition .",
    "as we have discussed above , a possible situation , especially in low - dimensional and frustrated systems , is that the mott transition occurs not in the whole system simultaneously , but `` piecewise '' , first in some finite clusters such as dimers , trimers , tetramers etc .",
    "but other nontrivial states may also occur in the vicinity of mott transitions , different both from those typical for strong mott insulators and for normal metals .",
    "these situations can occur also for simple lattices such as those of perovskites . in this chapter for completeness",
    "i will also shortly discuss some of these phenomena",
    ".      in some systems with strongly correlated electrons charge ordering occurs with decreasing temperature .",
    "usually it appears in systems with noninteger electron concentration ( fractional number of electrons per tm ion ) .",
    "the well - known examples are the verwey transition in magnetite fe_3o_4 ] or charge ordering in half - doped manganites such as la_0.5ca_0.5mno_3 ] , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "but there are also systems in which charge ordering , or rather spontaneous charge disproportionation , appears in case of , formally , integer electron occupation , or integer valence .",
    "such is for example the situation in cafeo_3 ] , in which there occurs charge segregation @xmath39 a phase transition with the formation of a fe^3+]fe^5 + ] superstructure occurs in cafeo_3 ] at @xmath40 and is simultaneously a metal  insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "note that a similar compound srfeo_3 ] with somewhat broader bands remains metallic down to lowest temperatures .",
    "apparently the phenomenon of charge disproportionation in this case occurs in the system close to the localized",
    " itinerant crossover .",
    "similar spontaneous charge disproportionation occurs also in la_2/3sr_1/3feo_3 ] @xcite ( 3fe^4 + 2fe^3 + + fe^5 + ] ) , but also e.g.  in nickelates @xmath41nio_3 ] , especially those with small rare earths @xmath42 , y , etc .",
    "@xcite . in nickelates",
    "charge disproportionation may be described by the `` reaction '' @xmath43 ( ni^3 + ] and ni^4 + ] here are in the low - spin state ) . in these systems charge disproportionation",
    "is also a metal  insulator transition .    yet",
    "other systems showing the same phenomenon are materials formally containing au^2+](@xmath44 ) , which at normal conditions always disproportionate into au^1+](@xmath45)@xmath46au^3+](@xmath47 ) .",
    "this occurs e.g.  in csaucl_3 ] which at ambient pressure contains two inequivalent au sites ( its formula is usually even written as cs_2au_2cl_6 ] ) . under pressure",
    "this system also becomes metallic with equivalent au ions  @xcite .",
    "one can notice three specific features , which apparently are important for the very phenomenon of spontaneous charge disproportionation .",
    "first , in tm compounds such charge disproportionation occurs in systems in which the tm ion in the `` original '' state would have been a strong jahn  teller ion , with double orbital degeneracy ( fe^4+](@xmath48 ) ; low - spin ni^3+](@xmath49 ) ; au^2+](@xmath50 ) ) .",
    "thus it seems that this spontaneous charge disproportionation appears in fe^4 + ] and ni^3 + ] compounds _ instead of _ the jahn  teller or orbital ordering , when the systems are close to localized  itinerant crossover  @xcite .",
    "but in `` au^2 + ] '' compounds such charge disproportionation is stabilized by the _ enhanced _ jt distortion instead  @xcite .",
    "second , the tm ionic states involved typically correspond to states with unusually high oxidation states , or untypically high valence ( fe^4 + ] and fe^5 + ] ; ni^3 + ] and ni^4 + ] ; au^3 + ] ) . as follows from the standard classification  @xcite , these states correspond to the situation with small or negative charge - transfer gaps and with a large contribution of ligand ( e.g.  oxygen ) @xmath51-holes . in effect",
    "e.g.  the reaction  ( [ eq:3 ] ) should be rather written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the ligand hole ( e.g.  fe^3+]@xmath53 instead of fe^4 + ] denotes the state fe^3+](@xmath54)o^-](@xmath55 ) ) .",
    "apparently the large contribution of ligand holes facilitates the process of charge disproportionation ( the increase of coulomb repulsion in the reaction  ( [ eq:5 ] ) is definitely much smaller than if it would occur on the @xmath8-shells  ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) .",
    "these factors lead to the third conclusion : that the spontaneous charge disproportionation is typically observed in systems close to an insulator  metal transition .",
    "experimentally this is indeed the case : in the examples mentioned above such disproportionation coincides with metal  insulator transition .      without going into details ,",
    "let us shortly mention yet another specific phenomenon , which is typically observed close to metal  insulator transitions .",
    "this is the phenomenon of phase separation , which often occurs especially in doped mott insulators .",
    "it is found experimentally in many cases ; in manganites  @xcite ; in cobaltites  @xcite ; and apparently also in cuprates  @xcite . the tendency towards phase separation",
    "is also seen theoretically in many models : in the hubbard @xcite and in the @xmath38@xmath30 models  @xcite ; in the double - exchange models @xcite , etc .",
    "the resulting state may be visualised as a random system with metallic regions in an insulating matrix .",
    "the properties of such state can be described by percolation theory  a classical description of random systems , although quantum effects in this case can also be very important .",
    "typical for many frustrated systems , which contain triangles or tetrahedra as building blocks , is an extra degeneracy , which can be characterized by spin chirality .",
    "thus the ground state of an equilateral triangle of @xmath13 spins with an antiferromagnetic interaction is a quartet , with the total spin @xmath56 and with extra double degeneracy , which can be characterized by the scalar spin chirality @xmath57\\;. \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] the physical meaning of the scalar chirality was clarified in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where it was shown that the states of a triangle with nonzero chirality  ( [ eq:6 ] ) carry a spontaneous circular electric current @xmath58 .",
    "correspondingly , such triangle would have an orbital magnetic moment @xmath59 .",
    "in the nondegenerate hubbard model with strong interaction @xmath60 the expression for this current , obtained in perturbation theory in @xmath61 , has the form @xmath62)\\;.\\ ] ] in this limit the current and the corresponding orbital moment are small .",
    "but one can show on general grounds , by using symmetry arguments , that such currents would be proportional to the chirality  ( [ eq:6 ] ) in the general case , for @xmath63 , and also close to mott transition .",
    "in such situations the corresponding current and orbital moments can be quite large .",
    "indeed , estimates done in @xcite , using the exact solution for a triangle , show that for reasonable values of parameters the orbital magnetic moments can be as large as @xmath64  comparable with the spin moment .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggested to use this degree of freedom for quantum computations .",
    "this is yet another nontrivial property of frustrated systems , which can lead to large and potentially useful effects close to mott transitions .",
    "in conclusion , i want to stress once again that the systems close to mott transition , or to a localized  itinerant crossover , can show a variety of specific properties , different from those of states deep in the mott insulator regime or those of conventional metals .",
    "especially interesting is the situation of a `` partial mott transition '' , in which first certain finite clusters go over to the regime with uncorrelated ( `` itinerant '' ) electrons , and only later there occurs a real mott transition in the whole sample .",
    "as i tried to show on many examples , the most favourable conditions for this phenomenon are met in low - dimensional and in frustrated systems ; they are less probable in simple lattices such as perovskites . but also other specific phenomena , less sensitive to the type of the lattice , such as spontaneous charge disproportionation , can occur close to insulator  metal transitions .",
    "thus this crossover region between localized and itinerant electronic states presents a rich playground for interesting physics , with eventually some novel states appearing in this situation .",
    "i am grateful to many people who contributed to works on which this paper is based , especially m.  abd - elmeguid , c.  batista , l.  bulaevskii , hua wu , i.  mazin , m.  mostovoy , v.  pardo , r.  rivadulla , s.  streltsov and a.  ushakov .",
