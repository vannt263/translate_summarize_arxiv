    "finite value of @xmath0 should be measured as soon as possible .",
    "numbers of next generation neutrino experiments using high intensity accelerator or reactor are starting within a few years .",
    "these experiments are aiming to discover the last unknown mixing angle @xmath0 by appearance ( @xmath5 ) or disappearance ( @xmath6 ) oscillation channel .",
    "if finite @xmath0 is detected , size of the mixing could determine direction of future experiments to search leptonic cp violation term .",
    "t2k experiment is a 295 km long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment based on accelerator in japan .",

    "neutrino beam is produced by @xmath10 decay from the proton interaction in graphite target .",
    "neutrino beam energy can be selected by putting detector intentionally off - axis of parent @xmath11 direction .",
    "we set the off - axis angle to @xmath12 in order to tune beam energy to be 0.6@xmath130.7 gev which corresponds that we can measure oscillation maximum at 295 km baseline when @xmath7 = ( 2.2 @xmath13 2.6 ) @xmath14 .",
    "this off - axis method gives intense narrow - band neutrino beam which about 1,600 charged current interactions per year are expected in super - kamiokande .",
    "it is two times larger intensity at the energy @xmath130.7 gev than the case of `` on - axis '' wide band beam .",
    "the off - axis beam has smaller high energy tail , and it reduces background contamination for the energy reconstruction as described below .              properties of neutrino beam `` before '' oscillation and its interaction are measured by near detectors . near detectors",
    "consists of muon monitor placed at 110 m downstream of proton target , and , on - axis and off - axis neutrino detectors placed at 280 m downstream of proton target .",
    "the muon monitor measures direction and intensity of neutrino beam at each spill by monitoring pion decay muons at just downstream of decay pipe .",

    "the far detector super - kamiokande is a cylindrically shaped water cerenkov detector .",

    "we are able to identify particle property using the feature of cerenkov ring image ; shower - type ring for electron while sharp - edged ring for muon .",

    "detailed description of super - kamiokande detector can be found in @xcite .",
    "t2k neutrino events are selected from other background events by using timing information . to enable the selection , both beam time stamp at j - parc and event time stamp at super - kamiokande are stamped by identical gps systems .",
    "beam timing information will be transfered to super - kamiokande immediately so that real - time gps timing reduction is enable .",
    "we measure @xmath1 appearance signal in @xmath9 beam by detecting cerenkov ring of single electron from @xmath1 ccqe interaction in super - kamiokande .",
    "major backgrounds in the search are intrinsic @xmath1 in the beam and mis - identification to single electron of single @xmath17 production in nc interactions .",
    "the @xmath1 component in the beam is 0.4% at the peak of beam energy .",
    "the nc @xmath17 is mis - identified when one of two photons from @xmath17 decay is mis - reconstructed or two cerenkov rings are overrapped .",
    "in addition to the selection criteria for the single electron used in the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino analysis , we apply specific @xmath18 separation cuts in order to further reduce nc @xmath17 background events .",
    "then events which reconstructed neutrino energy between 0.35 gev and 0.85 gev are selected .",
