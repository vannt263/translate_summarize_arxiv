    "these simulations are identical to simulation 4 ( presented in section [ sec : suite1 ] ) , except that in each case the distribution of sph particles representing the cloud has been rotated through three random angles .",
    "consequently , the particle noise  which influences the details of when and where star formation occurs , and therefore what the final stellar masses are  is different .",
    "table [ tab : suite3 ] summarises the global metrics for simulations 4 , 4a , 4b and 4c ; and figure  [ fig : suite3 ] shows surface - density images for the same simulations at @xmath153 ( top row ) and at @xmath154 ( bottom row ) .",
    "all the global metrics ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath111 ) are broadly similar , as is the morphology of the cloud at @xmath1 and the location of star formation .",
    "however , as would be expected for a chaotic non - linear process , the details of the final state ( masses and locations of individual stars at @xmath154 ) show a large spread , and this should be interpreted as a measure of the intrinsic variance of the process .",
    "we present the results of simulations of star formation triggered by radiatively driven implosion , i.e. stable clouds which are driven into collapse and fragmentation by being overrun by an hii region .",
    "the clouds are all modelled as stable bonnor ebert spheres ( i.e. equilibrium isothermal spheres ) with isothermal sound speed @xmath13 and bonnor - ebert parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the ionising star is always placed at distance @xmath158 from the initial centre of the cloud , but its ionising output , @xmath10 , and hence the ionising flux incident on the cloud , @xmath0 , are varied through over three orders of magnitude .      for ionising fluxes at the low end of this range , the evolution of the cloud is quite slow .",
    "when star formation starts at @xmath1 , the ionisation front on the exposed side of the cloud has a broad * u*-shape , and star formation is concentrated in a dense filament along the axis of symmetry of the cloud , some distance behind the ionisation front .",
    "this finding is in agreement with observations of star formation in bright rimmed clouds , as reported by @xcite .",
    "although compression of the cloud is relatively weak , star formation is quite efficient ( a large fraction of the cloud mass is converted into stars ) and the individual stars have relatively high mass , because there is a long period during which star formation can occur ; also , once formed , the stars remain embedded in the neutral gas for a long time and can therefore continue to grow by accretion . during the later stages of cloud dispersal ,",
    "the remnants of the cloud appear as a pillar protruding into the hii region ; the newly - formed stars emerge from this pillar , and into the hii region , as evaporating gaseous globules ( eggs ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for ionising fluxes at the high end of this range ,",
    "the evolution of the cloud is more rapid .",
    "when star formation starts at @xmath1 , the ionisation front on the exposed side of the cloud has a narrow * v*-shape , and star formation is concentrated at the tip of the * v * , just behind the ionisation front .",
    "although compression of the cloud is relatively strong , star formation is quite inefficient ( a small fraction of the cloud mass is converted into stars ) and the individual stars have relatively low mass , because there is very limited time available for star formation before the cloud is dispersed by being ionised ; also , once formed , the stars do not remain embedded in the neutral gas for long , and so they can not grow much by accretion . during the later stages of cloud dispersal ,",
    "the cloud breaks up into a bundle of small pillars which do not have enough mass to spawn further stars .",
