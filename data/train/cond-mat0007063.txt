    "recent advances in computer technology have allowed the exact diagonalization of ising - type quantum spin systems up to 36 sites in size .",
    "schulz , ziman and poilblanc ( 1996 ) , for example , studied the j1-j2 xxz heisenberg spin model on square lattices up to 6x6 sites .",
    "our aim in this paper is to carry out an exact diagonalization study of the transverse ising model on the square lattice , in order to estimate its critical parameters and study its finite - size scaling behaviour .",
    "the transverse ising model in ( 2 + 1)d is well - known to be the quantum hamiltonian corresponding to the classical 3d ising model ( suzuki 1976 , fradkin and susskind 1978 ) , and exhibits a quantum phase transition in the same universality class as the classical 3d ising thermal transition .",
    "it was first studied by series expansion methods by pfeuty and elliott ( 1971 ) , and there have been several further series expansion calculations since then , both ` low - temperature ' ( marland 1981 , yanase et al 1976 , oitmaa et al 1991 ) and ` high - temperature ' ( hamer and irving 1984 , hamer and guttmann 1989 , he et al 1990 ) .",
    "exact finite - lattice calculations have also been carried out previously ( roomany and wyld 1980 , hamer 1983 , henkel 1984 , 1987 ) for square lattices of up to 5x5 sites , and similar calculations have also been done for the triangular lattice ( hamer and johnson 1986 , henkel 1990 , price et al 1993 ) . here",
    "we extend these calculations for the first time to the 6x6 lattice , and use finite - size scaling theory to obtain improved estimates of the critical point and critical index @xmath0 .",
    "the finite - size scaling amplitudes at the critical point are also of interest . in ( 1 + 1)d",
    ", it is well - known that the theory of conformal invariance relates the scaling amplitudes to fundamental parameters of the underlying effective field theory at the critical point , such as the conformal anomaly and scaling indices . in higher dimensions ,",
    "a similar scenario is known to hold at ` first - order ' transitions , where a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken , giving rise to goldstone bosons ( hasenfratz and leutwyler 1990 ) : the finite - size scaling amplitudes are related to parameters of the goldstone bosons such as the spin - wave stiffness and spin - wave velocity . does something similar apply at second - order transitions in higher dimensions ?",
    "apart from a discussion by cardy ( 1985 ) , little has been done in this area .",
    "one peculiar result was obtained by henkel ( 1986 , 1987 ) and weston ( 1990 ) , and confirmed recently by weigel and janke ( 1999 ) : the scaling amplitudes of the spin - spin and energy - energy correlation lengths on _ antiperiodic _ lattices have a universal ratio : @xmath1 where the @xmath2 are the scaling indices in the respective sectors .",
    "this phenomenon appears to have no good theoretical explanation at the present time .",
    "our exact diagonalization methods are outlined briefly in section 2 , and the numerical results are presented in section 3 .",
    "the critical parameters so obtained are compared with other estimates in section 4 , and the critical amplitudes are discussed .",
    "the transverse ising model on the square lattice has the hamiltonian @xmath3 where the sum @xmath4 runs over nearest neighbour pairs on the lattice , and the @xmath5 matrices are the usual pauli spin operators acting on a 2-state spin - variable at each site .",
    "the coupling x is analogous to an inverse ` temperature ' , and h represents an external ` magnetic field ' .",
    "we shall employ a representation in which the @xmath6 are diagonal .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "the unperturbed ground - state of the model at @xmath7 has all spins ` up ' , i.e. @xmath8 , all @xmath9 . the interaction term will induce an admixture of states with ` flipped ' spins .",
    "the hilbert space of the model consists of two sectors , containing an odd and even number of flipped spins respectively .",
    "exact diagonalizations have been carried out for lxl lattices , l = 1, .. ,6 .",
    "the methods employed are fairly standard , for the most part , and will not be described in detail here .",
    "first , a list of allowed basis states in the given sector was prepared , using the ` sub - lattice coding ' technique of lin ( 1990 ) .",
    "this efficient technique produces a sorted list of states , requiring only one integer word of storage per state .",
    "since only the zero - momentum states are considered here , the states were ` symmetrized ' : that is , all copies of a given state under translations , reflections and rotations were represented by a single state .",
    "thus for the 6x6 lattice in the even sector , the total number of ` unsymmetrized ' states is approximately @xmath10 , whereas under symmetrization this is reduced by a factor of approximately 288 , down to 119,539,680 .",
    "next , the hamiltonian matrix elements are generated , by applying the interaction operators of equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) to each initial state , symmetrizing the resulting final state , and looking it up in the master file .",
    "the elements were grouped into blocks , each of which acts between small sub - sets of the initial and final state vectors , to avoid ` thrashing ' during the matrix multiplications . within each sub - set , the initial and final addresses",
    "can each be fitted into a half - integer , so that the matrix elements occupied 35 gbyte of storage over all .",
    "finally , the lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector of the hamiltonian were found in each sector , using the conjugate gradient method .",
    "nightingale et al ( 1993 ) showed that the conjugate gradient method converges faster than the lanczos method for large problems such as this .",
    "we found that the eigenvalue converged to an accuracy of 1 part in @xmath11 in 20 - 25 iterations for the 6x6 lattice in the neighbourhood of the critical point .",
    "having determined the quantities of interest for each finite lattice , it is then necessary to make an extrapolation to @xmath12 , to estimate the bulk behaviour of the system . in the vicinity of the critical point , the finite - lattice sequence will typically behave as @xmath13 where the @xmath14 are non - integer exponents , in general ( barber 1983 ) .",
    "the problem of extrapolating such a sequence has been discussed in several reviews ( smith and ford 1982 , barber and hamer 1982 , guttmann 1989 ) .",
    "we have employed a number of different algorithms , including :    * the neville table ( guttmann 1989 ) , which is best suited to a simple polynomial sequence , with integer exponents @xmath14 ; * the alternating vbs algorithm ( van den broeck and schwartz 1979 , barber and hamer 1982 ) , which can give good convergence for sequences of type ( [ 2.2 ] ) , but needs at least two iterations to work well ; * the lubkin algorithm ( 1952 ) , which is more suitable for short sequences ; * the bulirsch - stoer algorithm ( 1964 ) , which has been applied in this context by henkel and patkos ( 1987 ) , and henkel and sch \" utz ( 1988 ) .",
    "this algorithm involves an explicit parameter @xmath15 which can be optimized to match the leading power - law correction .",
    "it has been claimed by henkel and sch \" utz that the algorithm is more robust and more accurate than the vbs algorithm , especially for short sequences .",
    "the pseudo - critical point at lattice size l can be defined according to finite - size scaling theory ( barber 1983 ) as the coupling @xmath16 such that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scaled energy - gap ratio @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the energy gap for lattice size l. this point is found by calculating the energy eigenvalues at a cluster of 5 equally spaced points in the neighbourhood of @xmath16 , and then finding @xmath16 by interpolation between them .",
    "the spacing between the points was chosen as @xmath21 , estimated to balance the truncation and round - off errors in the calculation .",
    "the values of all other observables can then be estimated at @xmath16 by the same finite - difference interpolation procedures .",
    "tables 1 and 2 list the pseudo - critical points @xmath16 , and the values of the calculated observables at coupling @xmath16 for each pair of lattice sizes l and ( l-1 ) , for l = 2,3,4,5 and 6 . the values of @xmath16 for @xmath22 to 5 listed in table 1 agree through six figures with those calculated previously ( hamer 1983 ) .",
    "table 1 lists values for the ground - state energy per site @xmath23 for lattice size l , and its derivatives @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x. the values are expected to be accurate to the figures quoted ( or better ) as regards round - off error .",
    "the truncation error in the 5-point interpolation process is harder to estimate , since it involves unknown higher derivatives of @xmath26 , but we estimate it should be no more than about 1 part in @xmath27 for @xmath26 and 1 part in @xmath28 for @xmath29 .    we have also listed values in table 1 for the magnetic susceptibility , defined by @xmath30 this derivative was also estimated by a finite difference method , using a cluster of 5 data points around @xmath31 , with a spacing @xmath32 , giving an estimated truncation error of no more than 1 part in @xmath28 in the susceptibility .",
    "this calculation was a little too large to carry through for @xmath33 , with the facilities available .",
    "table 2 lists the energy gap @xmath34 between the odd and even sectors , and its derivatives @xmath35 and @xmath36 , at each @xmath16 .",
    "values are also listed here for the quantity @xmath37 defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the lowest - lying energy eigenvectors in the even and odd sectors , respectively",
    ". it can be shown ( yang 1952 , uzelac 1980 , hamer 1982 ) that this quantity converges towards the spontaneous magnetization in the bulk limit .",
    "unfortunately , for technical reasons we were again unable to calculate this quantity for l=6 .",
    "since the accuracy of the wavefunction is only the square root of that of the eigenvalue , the round - off error in these values is expected to be about 1 part in @xmath28 .",
    "the sequence of pseudo - critical points @xmath16 converges rapidly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath16 is plotted against @xmath41 . to estimate the bulk limit ( @xmath42 ) of this sequence , we have employed various algorithms discussed above , as well as a simple polynomial fit in @xmath41 and higher powers .",
    "our final estimate of the critical point is @xmath43 this is consistent with our earlier finite - size estimate of @xmath44 ( hamer 1983 ) , but nearly two orders of magnitude more accurate .",
    "henkel ( 1987 ) obtained an improved estimate @xmath45 from lattices up to 5x5 sites .",
    "finite - size scaling theory ( barber 1983 ) also tells us how to estimate the critical indices for the model . the finite - lattice susceptibility @xmath46 , for instance , is predicted to scale at the critical point like @xmath47 and hence one finds that @xmath48 similarly , ratios of the finite - lattice ` magnetizations ' ( equation [ 3.4 ] ) give estimates of @xmath49 .",
    "finally , estimates of the index @xmath50 can be obtained from the callan - symanzik ` beta function ' ( barber 1983 ) , @xmath51 via @xmath52    one would expect to obtain estimates of the ratio @xmath53 in a similar fashion from the ` specific heat ' , @xmath54 but it is known ( hamer 1983 ) that these estimates are very poor , too high by a factor of nearly 2 .",
    "the reason is easily found : the ground - state energy or specific heat contains a ` regular ' or analytic piece as well as the singular term ( privman and fisher 1984 ) . henkel ( 1987 ) has cleverly sidestepped this problem , using a transition amplitude to find @xmath53 , in analogy to equation ( [ 3.4 ] ) . here",
    ", we eliminate the regular term by subtracting : @xmath55 and using successive ratios of these differences to estimate @xmath56 the estimates so obtained for the critical index ratios are listed in table 3 .    alternatively",
    ", ` logarithmic ' estimates of the critical indices may be obtained as follows : @xmath57}{\\ln[l/(l-1 ) ] } \\sim \\frac{\\gamma}{\\nu } , \\hspace{5 mm } l \\rightarrow \\infty \\label{3.11}\\ ] ] these alternative estimates are listed in table 4 .",
    "the finite - size corrections are generally smaller for the logarithmic estimates .",
    "these finite - size estimates of the critical indices agree closely with the previous calculation of hamer ( 1983 ) up to @xmath58 ; and remarkably enough , most of them agree to within 4 significant figures with the equivalent results obtained for the triangular lattice ( hamer and johnson 1986 , price et al 1993 ) .    the same algorithms mentioned above have been employed to extrapolate these sequences to their bulk limit .",
    "the sequences are very short , and may have slight irregularities , so that the tabular algorithms are generally no more accurate than simple graphical methods or polynomial fits in the extrapolation .",
    "the resulting estimates are listed at the foot of tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the errors in these estimates are inevitably rather subjective , but the variation between different algorithms gives some indication of the likely error .",
    "figure 2 graphs the estimates of @xmath50 from tables 3 and 4 as a function of @xmath59 : it can be seen that the behaviour is almost precisely linear for the estimates from table 3 .",
    "correspondingly , the neville tables and polynomial fits give stable results , while the lubkin and bulirsch - stoer algorithms give less stable results , possibly a little higher .",
    "we conclude that @xmath60    the estimates for @xmath53 are not quite so well - behaved , but our final estimate is @xmath61 this is a much better result than can be obtained directly from the specific heat , equation ( [ 3.8 ] ) .    the estimates for the other indices @xmath49 and @xmath62 are rapidly convergent , but we only have data up to @xmath63 , which were known previously . we find @xmath64 @xmath65      the finite - size behaviour of the energy gap at the critical point is @xmath66 so the amplitude @xmath67 can be estimated by @xmath68 the sequence of estimates for @xmath67 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "it extrapolates to a value @xmath69 a value of 1.42 was previously estimated by henkel ( 1987 ) .",
    "the finite - size scaling behaviour of the ground - state energy per site @xmath26 at the pseudo - critical point is shown in figure 4 . the finite - size scaling corrections",
    "appear to decrease like @xmath70 , in accordance with the privman - fisher scaling hypothesis ( 1984 ) , which states that the singular part of the free energy density of a system of finite size l should scale as @xmath71 ( here d = 3 ) .",
    "a polynomial fit on this assumption gives @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 further evidence for this power - law behaviour can be obtained as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath75 then @xmath76",
    "\\equiv p_{l } \\sim p \\hspace{5 mm } $ as $ l \\rightarrow \\infty\\ ] ] and @xmath77/\\ln[l / l-1 ] \\sim -p    \\hspace{5 mm } $ as $ l \\rightarrow \\infty\\ ] ] the sequences of finite lattice estimates for p are shown in figure 5 .",
    "it can be seen that the ` linear ' sequence comes down towards 3 from above , whilst the ` logarithmic ' sequence comes up towards 3 from below .",
    "the sequences are a little irregular , however , and the best estimate we can obtain for the bulk limit is @xmath78 a little lower than , but still consistent with 3 .    assuming that @xmath79 , the scaling amplitude @xmath80 for the ground - state energy can be found by @xmath81 the sequence of estimates for @xmath80 is graphed in figure 6 , and extrapolates to a value @xmath82 which is in reasonable agreement with equation ( [ 3.21 ] ) .",
    "henkel ( 1987 ) previously obtained an estimate of 0.39 for this quantity ( allowing for the different normalization of his hamiltonian ) .",
    "mon ( 1985 ) obtained a monte carlo estimate of the corresponding free energy amplitude in the 3d classical model .    in order to ` calibrate ' this result",
    ", we need to know the  speed of light v , or in other words the scale factor needed in this model to make the long - range correlations isotropic in space and time at the critical point .",
    "we have attempted to estimate this using the dispersion relation for the lowest excited state at the critical point , expected to be of the form @xmath83 in the bulk system .",
    "we have calculated the finite - lattice eigenvalues for low - lying excited states with non - zero momntum for lattice sizes l=2 to 5 , and set @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the energy at coupling x for momentum k. figure 7 shows the sequence of finite - lattice estimates for v as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "they extrapolate to a bulk value @xmath86    the ratio @xmath87 should be a universal number , independent of the normalization of the hamiltonian . from the results above , we find @xmath88 to be compared with values of 0.719 expected according to effective field theory for a single free boson ( hasenfratz and niedermayer 1993 ) , or 0.211 for a single free fermion degree of freedom ( appendix ) .",
    "the result ( 3.31 ) matches neither of these values .",
    "this is not surprising , since the effective field theory at the critical point is expected to be a non - trivial interacting theory .",
    "it might be possible to estimate this quantity via the @xmath89-expansion , using a landau - ginzburg effective field theory .",
    "this has not yet been done , as far as we are aware .",
    "we have calculated the lowest - lying energy eigenvalues of the transverse ising model on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions for lattice sizes up to 6x6 sites , using the conjugate gradient method .",
    "finite - size scaling theory has been employed to estimate the critical parameters , which are compared with previous estimates in table 5 .",
    "it can be seen that our present estimates agree well with earlier finite - size scaling results .",
    "we have achieved a substantial increase in accuracy for the critical point , but only a more modest increase for the critical index @xmath0 .",
    "the results appear very compatible with previous series analyses , and also with recent estimates for the classical 3d ising model , and field theory .",
    "this provides further confirmation of the universality between these transitions .",
    "finally , it can be seen that the accuracy of the exponents for the quantum model is now not very far behind that for the classical model .",
    "we have also estimated the finite - size scaling amplitudes for the energy eigenvalues at the critical point .",
    "for the spin gap we find @xmath69 to be compared with a previous estimate by henkel ( 1987 ) of @xmath90 .    for the ground - state energy ,",
    "we have shown evidence that @xmath91 and estimated @xmath82 to be compared with a previous estimate of 0.39 by henkel ( 1987 ) .",
    "it should be possible to predict this amplitude from landau - ginzburg effective field theory .",
    "an extension to 7x7 sites of these exact diagonalization calculations is hardly feasible at the present time , but there are some very precise approximate methods now available , such as the density matrix renormalization group ( white 1992 ) and path integral monte carlo techniques ( sandvik 1992 ) .",
    "these might well be able to extend the results to larger lattice sizes , and allow much improved finite - size scaling estimates of the critical parameters .",
    "they could also confirm whether or not the casimir energy scales as in equation ( [ 4.2 ] ) .",
    "our exact diagonalization results should provide a useful calibration for such studies .",
    "we look forward to seeing such calculations in the future .    we have chosen here to work on the square lattice rather than the triangular one , because the hamiltonian matrix is somewhat smaller , and the leading finite - size corrections are expected to be much the same for both lattices .",
    "there are , however , some hints of irregularity or alternating behaviour in some of the square lattice sequences .",
    "it might well be that the triangular lattice results are smoother .",
