    "a scheme for integrating the equations of motion for the md phase of the hmc algorithm by introducing different time - scales for different segments of the action was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the leap - frog integrator is constructed from the two simple time - evolution operators generated by the the kinetic and potential energy terms .",
    "their effect on the system coordinates , @xmath0 are @xmath1 the simplest reversible leap - frog integrator is then @xmath2 if the action ( and thus the hamiltonian ) is split into two parts , @xmath3 then the two leap - frog integrators for these two pieces can be constructed as @xmath4 and a reversible integrator for the full hamiltonian can be constructed by combining the two schemes : @xmath5^m\\ ;         v_2(\\frac{\\delta \\tau}{2}),\\ ] ] with @xmath6 .",
    "this compound integrator effectively introduces two evolution time - scales , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we suggest that the multiple time - scale scheme is only helpful when two criteria are fulfilled simultaneously :    1 .",
    "the force term generated by @xmath9 is cheap to compute compared to that of @xmath10 and 2 .",
    "the split captures the high - frequency modes of the system in @xmath9 and the low - frequency modes in @xmath10 .",
    "the popular implementation of the scheme in dynamical fermion simulations with pseudofermions is to split the hamiltonian into the yang - mills term and the pseudofermion action : @xmath11^{-1 } \\phi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unfortunately for light fermions , the highest frequency fluctuations are in the pseudofermion action , which also has the more computationally expensive force term , thus the criteria are not met .",
    "the key to using the method then is to implement a low - computational cost scheme that separates the high- and low - frequency fermion molecular - dynamics .",
    "a very low - order polynomial approximation offers a cheap means of mimicking most of the short - distance physics of the fermion interations .",
    "recent interest in polynomial approximations to a matrix inverse was inspired by the multi - boson algorithm of ref .",
    "this led to the development of the polynomial hmc ( phmc ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "following this idea , we write an exact representation of the two - flavour probability measure @xmath12 with @xmath13^{-1 } \\phi \\right|^2     \\mbox { and }   s_\\chi = \\left| { \\cal p}(m ) \\chi \\right|^2    \\label{eqn : action}\\ ] ]    the fields @xmath14 are modified pseudofermions and we term the new fields @xmath15 , `` guide '' bosons .",
    "the algorithm exactly recovers the probability measure for the two - flavour theory for any choice of polynomial .",
    "this scheme is similar to the split - pseudofermion method of ref .",
    "@xcite with one distinction ; using polynomials allows us to modify the fermion modes easily and cheaply .",
    "the success of the algorithm hinges on the empirical observation that the fermion modes that induce the high - frequency fluctuations are localised and can be handled by very low - order polynomials .",
    "this means the force term for the guide bosons , generated by @xmath16 can be computed cheaply and a multiple time - scale integrator can be built that simultaneously fulfills the two criteria discussed earlier .",
    "the time - scale split is then @xmath17    note that in general , @xmath18 time - scales can be introduced straightforwardly by first adding @xmath19 sets of guide fields , then constructing a heirarchy of leapfrog integrators , with @xmath20 leap - frog steps at the @xmath21 level .",
    "this introduces @xmath18 time - scales , @xmath22 .",
    "the performance of the method is under investigation in simulations of the two - flavour massive schwinger model ( @xmath23 qed ) .",
    "hmc runs presented here are performed on @xmath24 lattices , with @xmath25 .",
    "non - hermitian chebyshev polynomial approximations are used @xcite .",
    "measurements of the dependence of the acceptance probability on the polynomial degree and tuning the md parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath26 are being made .",
    "[ fig : pacc ] shows the acceptance rate for the standard hmc algorithm ( with even - odd preconditioned pseudofermions ) along with the polynomial - filtered method .",
    "two different polynomials were used ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the solid lines are fits to the expected behaviour of hmc as @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 where the value of @xmath31 is determined by the best fit .",
    "@xmath31 is then a characteristic time - scale for the modes encapsulated in the pseudofermionic part of the action , @xmath32 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : action ] .",
    "since evaluation of the force term @xmath33 dominates in this parameter range , @xmath31 is a good indicator of algorithm performance .",
    "the algorithm has a number of free parameters , allowing a good deal of scope to optimise the performance . fig .",
    "[ fig : tau0 ] shows the characteristic time - scale for pseudofermion integration , @xmath31 as a function of chebyshev polynomial degree .",
    "@xmath31 rises very rapidly initially as the degree of the filter algorithm is increased , and @xmath31 for @xmath28 is about four times larger than for the standard hmc algorithm .",
    "inverting the pseudofermion matrix requires roughly the same computational cost , and thus the algorithm is four times more efficient than hmc ( assuming autocorrelations are the same ) .    for low values of @xmath34 ( the polynomial degree )",
    "the computational bottleneck is solver performance while for larger values , the evaluation of the force term arising from interactions between the gauge fields and the guide bosons begins to dominate .",
    "effective and simple strategies for tuning the algorithm are still under investigation .",
    "we are also investigating alternative choices of polynomial filters beyond chebyshev approximation .",
