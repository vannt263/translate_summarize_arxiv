    "the value of work function extracted from the band structure is @xmath21=4.57 ev ( @xmath21=4.37 ev for germanene ) . as seen , the calculated electronic structure using pw and ao are similar .",

    "the dirac points dip below the fermi level and the semimetallic silicene becomes a metal .",

    "however , when the same charged systems are treated with a relatively larger vacuum spacing of @xmath24  , the pw results dramatically deviate from those of ao .",

    "the cause of this spurious dependence of vacuum size can be understood through the ( @xmath25)-plane averaged self - consistent field ( scf ) electronic potential along the @xmath14-direction . a schematic description of the situation , which explains how the excess electrons for negatively charged silicene or germanene layers can spill into the vacuum region as a result of the above spurious effect is shown in fig .",

    "however , in the actual case of single silicene ( or germanene ) layer , which is charged with @xmath130 , @xmath26 passes through a maximum near the surface and goes to @xmath27 as @xmath28 at both sides . then , in view the 1d wkb approximation , the electrons in the silicene ( or germanene ) layer might have spilled to vacuum only if they could tunnel across a wide triangular barrier . the width of the barrier",
    ", @xmath29 decreases with increasing negative charging . under these circumstances ,",
    "the spilling of electrons must have been negligibly low and hence excess electrons are practically trapped in the layer , if the value of @xmath30 is not very high .",
    "however , when treated within pbc , @xmath26 of periodically repeating silicene ( or germanene ) layers with a vacuum spacing @xmath3 between them can make a dip reminiscent of a quantum well at the center of the spacing as shown in fig .",

    "if the quantum well dips below the fermi level with increasing @xmath3 or @xmath11 , excess electrons in silicene or germanene start to be accommodated in these 2d free - electron like bands .",

    "the amount of excess electrons spilled to the vacuum spacing increases with increasing @xmath3 and also increases with increasing negative charging at a fixed value of @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) and fig .  [ fig2 ] ( c ) , where the fermi level pinned by the parabolic bands of electrons spilled to the vacuum for large @xmath3 , is an artifact of the pbc and give rise to the dependence on the size of vacuum .",
    "as for ao calculations , the spurious quantum well like structure at the middle of vacuum spacing between silicene or germanene layers in pbc are devoid of basis set and hence can not support the bound electronic states , since the local atomic orbitals are placed only at the atomic sites .",
    "this is why @xmath26 calculated by ao does not accommodate excess electrons in its minimum between silicene layers and hence the parabolic bands seen in fig .",

    "in contrast to the above shortcomings arising in pw method in treating the negative charging @xmath130 , results obtained by ao and pw are in reasonable agreement for @xmath34 , since @xmath26 passes through a maximum at the center of @xmath3 between graphene layers . accordingly , a method using pbc and pw basis set is not affected significantly from the size of vacuum spacing @xmath3 , if @xmath34 . for positively charging ,",

    "when treated by pw method , this quantum well like structure can dip below the fermi level and hence electrons of silicene which can be accommodated in this quantum well end up with the electron spilling to vacuum by resulting in a similar situation above for @xmath330 .",
    "this situation is schematically described in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",

    "spin - polarized calculations indicate that the non - magnetic ground state of silicene and germanene is practically unaltered upon charging or under electric field . however , the permanent magnetic moment of a ti atom adsorbed to silicene and germanene exhibit significant changes upon charging or under the electric field . however , it is argued that ordinary dft may not be appropriate to treat the strongly correlated @xmath36-orbitals , such as in adsorbed ti atom .",
    "often approaches such as dft+u are used to address this issue@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , in most cases concerning ti adsorbed on si and graphene surfaces , dft has provided reasonable predictions .",
    "earlier , we examined the effects of correlation by performing lda+u calculations@xcite . since u parameters were not available for ti adsorbed on si surfaces , we carried out calculations by taking u as a parameter@xcite .",
    "we also performed similar calculations for transition metal dichalcogenides , sco2 , nio2 and wo2 in single layer honeycomb structure@xcite .",
    "we found that in these studies up to high values of u our predictions obtained by dft remained valid .",
    "energetically , the most favorable bonding site of the ti adatom on silicene and germanene is found to be the hollow site , above the center of the hexagon .",
    "we investigate the magnetic properties of ti covered silicene and germanene using supercell geometry in different levels of coverage , since the resulting magnetic ground states depend on the ti - ti coupling and hence on the coverage of ti atom .",
    "first , we consider the case of very weak ti - ti coupling by using uniform coverage in which one ti adatom is adsorbed to each ( 4 x 4 ) supercell of silicene(germanene ) corresponding to @xmath37=1/32 ( i.e. one ti atom per 32 si(ge ) atoms ) and leading to the ti - ti distance of 15.39(16.06 ) . in the neutral case ,",
    "both silicene and germanene have a spin - polarized , ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state with a magnetic moment of @xmath38 @xmath39 ( i.e per ( 4 x 4 ) supercell ) .",
    "the magnetic moment of the spin - polarized state of silicene increases to @xmath40 @xmath39 ( @xmath41 @xmath39 for germanene ) for @xmath42 + 1.0 e / cell . for the excess electronic charge of @xmath43 the magnetic moment increases to @xmath44 @xmath39 ( @xmath45 @xmath39 for germanene ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath46 is due to the accommodation of different electronic charges of ti @xmath0-states for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "similar effect can be generated also by the static electric field .",
    "spin - polarization of ti adsorbed silicene and germanene show also significant changes with applied electric field @xmath10 . while their magnetic moments become unaltered for @xmath47   ( i.e. @xmath10 is directed towards ti adatom ) , they increase to @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "apparently , either by charging of ti+silicene ( ti+germanene ) @xmath50 complex or by exerting an electric field , @xmath51 one can modify the occupations of @xmath0-orbitals and hence can change the net magnetic moment .",
    "when a significant ti - ti interaction sets in , the magnetic ground states show interesting changes as presented in table i. we consider the case of significant ti - ti coupling by using uniform coverage in which 4 ti adatoms are adsorbed to each @xmath50 supercell of silicene(germanene ) corresponding to @xmath52 coverage and leading to a ti - ti distance of 7.69  ( 8.03 ) .",
    "this supercell geometry allows us to treat the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order .",
    "similar to the coverage of @xmath53 , silicene and germanene has fm spin polarized fm magnetic ground states at @xmath52 , except the case of afm ground state occurring under @xmath10=1 v /  .",
    "also we predict that an external effect like @xmath11 or @xmath10 causing charge depletion from ti adatom give rise to an increase in the magnetic moment .",

    "@xmath55 denotes for positive @xmath10=1 v /   ( directed towards ti atom ) and vice versa for @xmath56 .",

    "the direction of the electric field is reversed causing charge transfer towards to ti atom .",
    "in conclusion , single silicene and germanene can attain useful functionalities by charging and by perpendicular electric field .",
    "while charging maintains the symmetry between both sides of honeycomb structure , this symmetry is broken down by the electric field perpendicular to the layer . as a result ,",
