    "the pioneering work @xcite of goldbeter and koshland ( gk ) brought into light an interesting molecular switch - like transition , now referred to as zero order ultrasensitivity ( zou ) @xcite , observed in reversible covalent modification ( e.g. phosphorylation or methylation ) of a protein ( substrate ) , catalyzed by two antagonistic enzymes .",
    "this switch - like behavior emerges in the limit where the substrate concentration is exceedingly large compared to the enzyme concentrations as well as their individual michaelis constants . in this",
    " zero - order \" regime , the modified fraction of substrate , in a saturating environment , exhibits a sharp transition at a critical value of the ratio of the total concentrations of the antagonistic enzymes .",
    "various aspects of gk switch has been studied over the years @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations associated with the ultrasensitive module has also been studied @xcite .",
    "zou was also identified as allosteric cooperativity by quian ( 2003 ) @xcite and ge and quian ( 2008 ) @xcite .",
    "the bacterium    _ e. coli _ has thousands of receptors on its cell surface for a precise sensation of the extracellular environment .",
    "the two main types of chemotaxis receptors are tar and tsr . the receptor protein and the protein kinase chea",
    "are linked by the linker protein chew . the receptor protein , chea and chew function as a single signaling complex , which exists in _ active _ or _ inactive _ state , and can undergo stochastic switching between the states .",
    "the switching is regulated by methylation and ligandation ( binding of chemoattractant / repellent ) of the receptors .",
    "methylation is carried out by the protein cher while cheb demethylates receptors . in its active state ,",
    "the receptor - chew - chea complex phosphorylates cheb and the response regulator chey ; while the former demethylates the receptor , the latter induces tumbles by binding to the flagellar motor . in this way , the internal biochemistry ( methylation / demethylation ) and external stimulus ( attractant / repellent ) regulates the swimming pattern of the organism ( reviewed in @xcite ) .    a remarkable property of chemotaxis in _",
    "e. coli _ is perfect adaptation to some chemoattractants .",
    "after exposure to a stimulus corresponding to an abrupt rise or fall in ligand concentration in a homogeneous environment , the frequency of tumbles returns to its pre - stimulus level after a time interval @xmath6 4 seconds @xcite . a model of the methylation - demethylation cascade proposed by barkai and leibler ( bl )",
    "@xcite successfully explains this property using a few simple assumptions .",
    "the model was modified and extended in later years by other authors @xcite .",
    "the important assumptions in the model are ( a ) cher methylates inactive receptors while cheb ( or its phosphorylated form , chebp ) demethylates active receptors , ( b ) the state of activity of a receptor depends on its methylation level , ( c ) binding of an attractant ( ligand ) molecule adversely affects the activity of a receptor , ( d ) ligand binding and dissociation are very fast compared to methylation and demethylation .",
    "mello and tu @xcite showed that perfect adaptation is achieved only if the lowest methylation level is assumed to be always inactive , while the highest level is assumed to be always active .",
    "as a consequence of these assumptions , the mean receptor activity in the model in steady state turns out to be independent of the attractant concentration .",
    "further , mathematical modeling has shown that , with suitable extensions , the model also successfully predicts the response of the network to a short - lived spike in attractant concentration@xcite .    in _ e.coli_ , the most abundant receptor , tar , responding to the attractant methyl aspartate , has four methylation sites per monomer . for modeling purposes",
    ", it is convenient to represent the methylation state of a single receptor by an index @xmath7 , where @xmath8 with @xmath5 being the maximum value ( @xmath4 for tar ) .",
    "it is generally assumed that activation / inactivation as well as ligand binding / unbinding of a receptor happens much faster compared to methylation / demethylation . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the bl model is entirely identical with the goldbeter - koshland ( gk ) two - state system ; the ligand concentration @xmath10 plays no role whatsoever in the dynamics . for @xmath11 , the intermediate state(s ) which stochastically switches(switch ) between active and inactive states modifies the dynamics ; however , the model retains the same structure as the gk module ( see fig [ fig1 ] , where we have provided a schematic depiction of the bl model , for @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , it is pertinent to enquire whether zou is present also in the bl model . in the gk system ( @xmath0 in our model ) , fluctuations in activity are known to be large near the zou transition . in _ e.coli _",
    "chemotaxis , intrinsic fluctuations are expected to play an important role .",
    "the flagellar motor responds ultrasensitively to [ cheyp ] ( p denoting the phosphorylated form ) ; the sensitive part of the motor response curve is less than 1@xmath12 m in width @xcite , hence it is likely that spontaneous and random fluctuations in activity are crucial in generating the run - and - tumble motion of the organism @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we believe that a detailed study of zou in the bl model , including a systematic treatment of fluctuations will make a useful addition to existing literature on zou as well as chemotaxis in _ e.coli_. this is the motivation behind this paper .",
    "let us denote by @xmath13 the volume of a cell having a total of @xmath14 receptor proteins ( substrate ) , and two enzymes . in _ e.coli_ ,",
    "these correspond to the methyltransferase cher and methylesterase cheb , the total concentrations of each are denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively . in the presently accepted model of signal transduction in _",
    "e.coli_ , cher methylates the receptor , while cheb demethylates it .",
    "according to the two - state model @xcite the receptor exists in a complex form involving two more proteins , chew and chea , and the complex may exist in one of two conformational states , which we refer to as _ active _ and _ inactive_. in the active state , chea undergoes autophosphorylation and also phosphorylates the cytoplasmic messenger protein chey .",
    "chea phosphorylates cheb also , a process crucial in adaptation , but ignored here for the sake of maintaining close structural similarity with the gk system .",
    "the probability to be in the active state is an increasing function of the methylation level of the receptor .",
    "chemoattractant molecules , if present , also bind to the receptor , and this process increases the probability to find the receptor in inactive state ( with chemorepellents , it is the reverse)@xcite .",
    "bl proposed a quantitative model @xcite of the signal transduction cascade , based on the two - state model of asakura and honda @xcite . in this model ,",
    "cher binds only to inactive receptors , while cheb binds only to active receptors @xcite . in general",
    ", we denote by @xmath5 the total number of methylation sites .",
    "let @xmath17 symbolically represent a receptor in methylation state @xmath7 , and @xmath18 denotes its enzyme - bound form ; the same symbols will also be used to denote the corresponding numbers ( out of a total of @xmath19 ) .",
    "the inactive and active versions are identified by superscripts @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the binding rate of cher to a receptor is @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the dissociation rate ; for cheb , the corresponding quantities are @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "attractant binding is relevant only for the intermediate state ; we assume that the binding rate is @xmath26 , dissociation rate is @xmath27 and attractant concentration is @xmath10 ( assumed uniform ) . @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the product formation rates from cher and cheb - bound intermediate states , respectively .",
    "the concentrations of the free forms of cher and cheb are denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "we also define a set of dissociation constants : @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 denote the fraction of receptors in methylation state @xmath7 at time @xmath34 , the total active fraction of receptors is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the probability for a receptor in state @xmath7 to be active , @xmath10 being the ( uniform ) attractant concentration .",
    "we assume that the lowest state ( @xmath37 ) is always inactive , while @xmath38 is always active ; the intermediate state(s ) can be either active or inactive , depending on whether it is attractant - bound .",
    "a simple mathematical form satisfying these conditions is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the dissociation constant for attractant binding to a receptor in state @xmath7 @xcite . to satisfy the earlier assumption , we choose @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( these are ideal values ) .",
    "we further choose @xmath43@xcite , a simple mathematical form which satisfies our earlier assumptions .",
    "we will first carry out a detailed mathematical analysis of the properties of the bl model with @xmath0 .",
    "fig [ fig1 ] shows a schematic depiction of this case , showing all the biochemical reactions . in the limit where the modification rates @xmath28 and @xmath29 are very small in comparison with the other rates",
    ", it may be visualized as a combination of three weakly - coupled modules ( the boxes in fig  [ fig1 ] ) ; the fractional populations of receptors in each module are @xmath44 with @xmath45 ; hence @xmath46 . in general , for a complete stochastic description of the dynamics of this system , we also need to keep track of time evolution of the intra - modular populations viz .",
