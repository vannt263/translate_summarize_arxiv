    "the @xmath5 reaction has been measured for many years @xcite , either for its own intrinsic physics interest or as a calibration for other reactions . however , because of the importance of establishing the precise beam energy , accurate experiments near threshold could be carried out much easier with the advent of cooled proton beams @xcite .",
    "the region within a few mev of threshold is very interesting because it shows the interplay of the dominant @xmath6-wave production , induced by the @xmath7 resonance , and the small @xmath8-wave rescattering terms .    since the phase - space for producing a three - body final state varies like @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the c.m .",
    "kinetic energy in the exit channel , the determination of the beam energy is even more crucial in such experiments near threshold .",
    "the accurate measurements of the @xmath2 total cross section at the indiana @xcite and celsius storage rings @xcite down to @xmath11  mev provoked great theoretical interest because the comparatively large cross section revealed the influence of unexpected short - range physics @xcite .",
    "the total and differential cross sections for charged pion production in the allied @xmath12 reaction have also been measured very close to threshold @xcite and these results have recently been complemented by the determination of the proton analyzing power @xcite . at the same value of @xmath10 , charged pion production is typically a factor of five larger than neutral and the interesting practical question to ask is to what extent the extra information will constrain theory further .",
    "the general features of the first results on the @xmath12 total cross section near threshold @xcite can in fact be understood within a nucleon - nucleon final state interaction model using measurements of the @xmath5 and @xmath2 reactions as input @xcite .",
    "this approach uses an approximation for the @xmath13 spin - triplet scattering wave function in terms of the deuteron bound - state wave function which does not depend upon the details of the @xmath13 potential @xcite .",
    "this result , which is exact when the @xmath13 scattering energy is extrapolated to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the deuteron binding energy , is generally a very good approximation for small energies and distances @xcite .",
    "taking the pion production operator to be of short range , the formalism allows one to estimate the cross section for the @xmath12 reaction where the final @xmath13 pair are in the spin - triplet @xmath16-wave . the much smaller contribution from spin - singlet final states",
    "may be deduced directly from the @xmath2 data using isospin invariance .",
    "the agreement with the measured total cross sections is generally very encouraging except for underestimating the point nearest threshold @xcite , which is the hardest to measure experimentally . in the definitive data set of ref.@xcite ,",
    "the value at this point is somewhat reduced and a more careful evaluation of coulomb effects given in this present work increases the near - threshold prediction .",
    "these two changes reduce the discrepancy significantly .    away from threshold",
    "our final state interaction approach is capable of describing the angular distribution of the triumf @xmath12 data at 400 and 450  mev @xcite provided the excitation energy in the @xmath13 final state is below about 10  mev , where @xmath16-waves can be expected to dominate @xcite .",
    "differential cross sections in the pion c.m",
    ".  angle are now also available near threshold @xcite , and we here extend our formalism to describe such data .",
    "a major uncertainty in implementing this program is the restricted differential cross section information for the @xmath2 reaction corresponding to the total cross sections reported in ref.@xcite . assuming this to be isotropic",
    ", we predict the @xmath12 angular distribution to be a little steeper than that observed experimentally @xcite , though it should be noted that there are also uncertainties in the @xmath5 input @xcite .",
    "the proton analyzing power in low energy @xmath17 is largest at @xmath18 and the energy dependence of this quantity for the three - body @xmath12 final state has just been reported by an iucf group @xcite .",
    "the extension of our fsi method to treat analyzing powers is straightforward , but its application is hindered by the dearth of @xmath19 data in the @xmath20 spin - singlet final state . assuming this to be small , the broad features of the @xmath18 energy dependence are reproduced .",
    "calculations within our final state interaction model are not definitive in that they do not use all of the energy dependence of the @xmath16-state neutron - proton scattering wave functions .",
    "this means however that they do not require detailed considerations of the range dependence of the pion production operator .",
    "higher partial waves in the neutron - proton final state are simply ignored and this will become a bigger defect with increasing energy .",
    "nevertheless we claim that any microscopic calculation which reproduces the measured @xmath5 and @xmath2 observables should , near threshold , give results qualitatively similar to the ones presented here .",
    "the tolerable agreement with the @xmath12 data therefore suggests that the extraction of quantitatively new information on the basic pion production reaction mechanism near threshold requires accurate measurements combined with much more refined theoretical calculations .    in sec .  2 we discuss the relation of the @xmath21 scattering and bound state wave functions in the spin - triplet @xmath16-state and",
    "illustrate it with the results obtained from the paris potential @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the spin - singlet wave functions is investigated with and without coulomb effects and it is shown that the major difference between the two can be accounted for by merely shifting the position of the @xmath22s@xmath23 pole on the second sheet .    though at low energies it is reasonable to consider only @xmath16-wave nucleon - nucleon systems , pionic @xmath6-waves enter quickly because of the smallness of the @xmath8-wave terms . in sec .",
    "3 we develop the formalism to include the effects of pionic @xmath8- and @xmath6-waves , together with the approximate wave functions , in the three - body phase space to estimate the measured @xmath12 observables .",
    "coulomb corrections are included in the @xmath8-wave in the same approximate manner as that used to treat the low energy @xmath5 reaction .    as previously stressed , the agreement with the experimental data presented in sec .",

    "of course the approximation breaks down at large distances because the bound and scattering wave functions must be orthogonal when integrated over all space .    in the case of an almost bound virtual state , where the pole is on the second sheet",

    "the smooth fit @xmath41 lies 0.5% below the value of the deuteron wave function , but that is close to the limit in the precision of the extrapolation .",
    "this deviation could of course be due to effects of the @xmath33-state , though the paris potential also includes some velocity dependence which may lie outside the domain of validity of the theorem . while almost all the energy dependence is given by the square - root factor in eq .",
    "( [ 2_6 ] ) , @xmath42 is a steadily increasing function and this is typical for potentials with just one lightly bound state .",
    "nevertheless , even at @xmath43  mev it lies less than 8% above the deuteron point .",
    "it should be noted that the slope of this function depends upon the value of @xmath25 and that at @xmath44  fm the function is almost flat .",

    "we have shown within the framework of a simple final state interaction theory that most of the low energy data on the total and differential cross sections and proton analyzing power for the @xmath12 reaction can be understood semi - quantitatively in terms of equivalent information deduced from @xmath108 and @xmath5 measurements .",
    "we would argue that any more microscopic approach with finite range pion - production operators , which fit the latter data , would give @xmath12 predictions broadly similar to the ones presented here , though with some deviations at higher values of @xmath61 due to the neglect of final @xmath13 @xmath109-wave contributions .",
    "such contributions might be responsible for some of the discrepancies observed in the angular distributions and analyzing power . to take full advantage of the accurate iucf data would require a sophisticated microscopic model to be accurate to the 10% level .",
    "it could then be helpful if such a model were consistently applied in the evaluation of the experimental acceptances rather than relying on the watson fsi approach @xcite .",
    "qualitatively new information , against which to test our approach , would be provided by experiments which introduce interferences between triplet and singlet final @xmath13 states , as for example in the @xmath110 spin - transfer .",
    "these are however much harder to perform in practice",
    ".    the deviations between our predictions and the iucf data @xcite may be partially experimental in origin .",
    "it should be noted that there are uncertainties of the order of 10% in some of the @xmath5 observables used as input , and this is worse for the differential quantities in @xmath2 .",
    "however it is also apparent from fig .  1 that our formalism will tend to underestimate slightly the triplet contribution to the @xmath12 cross section because @xmath111 is an increasing function of @xmath39 .",
    "the rate of rise depends upon the nucleon - nucleon separation and so it is impossible to quantify the effect without having a detailed model for the pion - production operator .",
