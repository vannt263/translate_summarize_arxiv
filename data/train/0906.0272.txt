    "the study of the qualitative behaviour of dynamical systems is a vast subject with applications in many fields . in particular monotone systems , i.e. systems which preserve some partial order on the state space ,",
    "have been intensively studied , with a range of qualitative results on asymptotic behaviour in these systems .",
    "see @xcite for a recent survey or @xcite for an earlier monograph on the subject .",
    "when the state space is some subset of euclidean space , and the preserved partial order is the `` natural '' order generated by the positive orthant , we get so - called cooperative systems .",
    "the fundamental notions connected with cooperativity extend to more general orderings ( @xcite for example ) .",
    "monotonicity constrains the behaviour of dynamical systems , for example ruling out attracting nontrivial periodic orbits , provided at least one point of any periodic orbit it accessible from above or below @xcite .",
    "when a dynamical system is strongly monotone ( to be defined below ) behaviour is constrained further : for almost all initial conditions bounded solutions converge to the set of equilibria , a result initially proved for strongly cooperative systems by m. hirsch in @xcite . sometimes generic convergence claims can be strengthened , provided additional structure is available .",
    "for instance , global convergence ( i.e. convergence of _ every _ bounded orbit ) can be obtained in a variety of special cases : for tridiagonal strongly cooperative systems @xcite ; when a system enjoys so - called `` positive translation invariance '' @xcite ; and when a strongly cooperative system is endowed with a strictly increasing first integral ( the result of mierczyski @xcite to be generalised here ) . in this latter case ,",
    "the conclusions are stronger still : there can be no more than one equilibrium on each level set of the first integral , and when it exists , such an equilibrium attracts the whole level set . in the same spirit",
    "is theorem 5 of @xcite , which shows how for lattice state spaces , and provided a unique equilibrium exists , all bounded solutions converge to this equilibrium .",
    "the importance of mierczyski s result stems from the fact that in a variety of applications natural constraints lead to order preservation , while at the same time conservation laws define preserved functions .",
    "however , as shown for chemical reaction networks in @xcite , the preserved partial orders may not be induced by orthants , and indeed , may not be induced by simplicial cones . thus appropriate generalisations of mierczyski",
    "s result potentially have useful application in these areas .",
    "a small example of such an application will be presented later .",
    "we state the main result and outline the proof .",
