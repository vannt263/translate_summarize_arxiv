    "consider @xmath0-steps _ self avoiding walk _ ( saw ) on the seven regular infinite planar triangulation .",
    "the goal of this note it to prove that the saw is ballistic in expectation , i.e. , that the expected distance from the starting point grows linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "this was already established for sufficiently large planar lattices in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that euclidean saw is sub - ballistic and see @xcite for ballisticity of saw on cayley graphs with more than one end .",
    "recall that the @xmath0-steps saw is the uniform measure on the set of all length @xmath0 self avoiding paths starting at a fixed root . for background on saw",
    "see @xcite , for background on gromov hyperbolic spaces see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be the seven regular infinite planar triangulation .",
    "then the expected displacement of @xmath0 steps saw on @xmath1 is bigger than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a constant determined by @xmath1 .",
    "question : improve the theorem to an asymptotically almost sure ballisticity .",
    "no bounds on the number of self avoiding walks are used , unlike the argument in @xcite , and therefore no bounds on the spectral gap are needed .",
    "the proof here works as is , for every @xmath4-skeleton of any hyperbolic lattice in @xmath5 , which is generate by reflections of the fundamental domain .",
    "see @xcite for a survey on such lattices , which exist also in dimensions bigger than @xmath6 , yet there are no such of dimension bigger than @xmath7 . we leave it as an open _ question _ to adapt the proof to any finite volume lattice .",
    "another model in which the proof works as is , is that of saw defined directly on @xmath5 as follows : consider continuous @xmath0 steps random walk on @xmath5 , where the next step is chosen uniformly and independently on the unit sphere around the current location .",
    "look at the restriction of this uniform product measure to sequences in which the distance between any pair of vertices is bigger than @xmath3 , for some @xmath8 , fixed .",
    "twenty years ago oded schramm briefly commented over lunch , that abundance of reflections will imply that hyperbolic saw is ballistic .",
    "conceivably the argument here follows what oded had in mind .",
    "[ fig:7hyp ]    here is an outline of the proof . given a self avoiding walk @xmath9 in a space of constant negative curvature , a constant portion of the vertices are at the boundary of the convex hull of the walk . after reflection the part of @xmath9 from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , at a tangent of the convex hull at @xmath10 , the inverse triangle inequality is satisfied at @xmath10 , that is @xmath12 where @xmath13 depends only on the lattice , and @xmath14 denotes the reflected path .",
    "we will see that the counting measure on the space of saw of length @xmath0 is up to multiplicative constant , invariant with respect to reflections at a tangent of the convex hull , as these are order @xmath0 abundant .",
    "therefore a constant fraction of the vertices on a constant fraction of the self avoiding walks , satisfy the inverse triangle inequality .",
    "now a path in bounded degree gromov hyperbolic graph , with inverse triangle inequality holding for portion of the vertices must be ballistic .",
    "question : show that saw on @xmath15 is ballistic ? where @xmath16 is the three regular tree .",
    "saw should be ballistic on any cayley graph in which simple random walk is ballistic .",
    "in particular all non amenable cayley graphs .    we expect saw to be ballistic on any infinite planar triangulation , in which all degrees are at least @xmath17 ( non positive curvature ) and there is @xmath18 , so that every @xmath19-ball in the triangulation contains a vertex of degree at least @xmath20",
    ". such triangulations are non amenable ( see @xcite ) and for any finite set , a constant fraction of the vertices are at the boundary of the convex hull .",
    "consider the uniform measure on anchored connected subsets of size @xmath0 in a hyperbolic lattice , or non amenable hyperbolic transitive graphs .",
    "conjecture : the scaling limit of uniform connected subsets is brownian tree .",
    "both when taking the ambient metric on the connected set , as an embedded subset , or the internal metric .",
    "see @xcite for a related result and definition of the scaling limit .",
    "similar conjecture should hold for the scaling limit of _ self avoiding loop _ in the ambient metric .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the probability euclidean saw makes a loop decays polynomially to @xmath21 .",
    "show exponential decay for the analogous event on the seven regular triangulations .",
    "this will give almost sure ballsticity of the saw .",
    "simple counting gives this for @xmath22-regular triangulation with large @xmath22 .",
    "recall ( see e.g. @xcite ) that a graph is gromov hyperbolic if for some @xmath23 , all geodesic triangles are @xmath24-thin . where a geodesic triangle is called @xmath24-thin if the distance from any point on one of the geodesics to the union of the two other geodesics is bounded by @xmath24 .",
    "from now on @xmath1 denotes the seven regular infinite planar triangulation . the following two lemmas are essentially from @xcite .",
    "[ convex2 ] let @xmath25 a finite set of vertices in a hyperbolic lattice .",
    "then there are @xmath28 depending only on the lattice , so that at least @xmath27 vertices of @xmath25 are at distance at most @xmath29 from the boundary of the convex hull of @xmath25 .",
    "proof : let @xmath30 be the minimal distance between distinct lattice points . for any finite subset @xmath25 of the lattice , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the volume of the convex hull @xmath33 of @xmath34 differs from @xmath35 by at most a constant factor .",
    "pick a random point @xmath36 . since the lattice is non amenable , with constant probability",
    ", it lies in @xmath34 , and its distance from @xmath37 is at most a constant .",
    "therefore a constant fraction of @xmath34 is of constant distance from @xmath37 , which implies the same for @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath38    [ two convex sets ] assume @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is @xmath24-hyperbolic graph are disjoint convex sets with @xmath41 , then the following holds : for any @xmath42 , the geodesic between @xmath43 and @xmath44 intersects the ball around @xmath45 of radius @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "proof of lemma : in any gromov hyperbolic space where all triangles are @xmath24-thin , if the distance between a pair of two sided infinite geodesics , is bigger than @xmath24 , then the distance between the pair of geodesics outside a ball of radius @xmath19 , grows at least exponentially in @xmath19 .",
    "separate the two convex sets by two such geodesic to finish .",
    "( in higher dimension separate the two convex sets by geodesic hyperplanes , to get a similar result ) .",
    "@xmath38            @xmath1 is obtained by reflecting an heptagon ( the dual graph of the triangulation ) in @xmath53 , which is a fundamental domain for the seven regular lattice .",
    "pick the @xmath20 reflections along geodesics which extends the edges of the fundamental domain . for each vertex in the graph fix @xmath20 such reflections , and ordered them arbitrarily .",
    "define @xmath55 as follows .",
    "pick the first reflection , in the order on reflections at @xmath10 , which reflect the part of @xmath9 from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , along a tangent to the convex hull of the self avoiding walk at @xmath10 , and apply it on @xmath9 .",
    "if there is no such reflection at @xmath10 , then @xmath56 does nt change the walk .",
    "* remark : * ( other lattices of hyperbolic reflection groups ) note that for @xmath4-skeletons of other lattices arising from reflections , when we only have  [ convex2 ] and  [ two convex sets ] with @xmath58 and @xmath23 , a local modification of the reflection at @xmath59 , @xmath56 is needed : reflect the self voiding walk along a geodesic tangent to a vertex @xmath60 of distance @xmath61 away from @xmath10 and the convex hull , and then locally modify the reflected self avoiding walk by connecting @xmath10 to @xmath60 , by a @xmath61 long path , and remove @xmath61 long segment from the end of the walk .    by lemma  [ convex ] uniformly over all walks in @xmath54 , a constant portion of the vertices are on the the boundary of the convex hull , so it is possible to apply a reflection at @xmath10 at a portion of the indexes , and for any walk the total number of reflections is order @xmath0 .",
    "proof of claim : fix @xmath9 and pick @xmath59 uniformly between @xmath21 and @xmath0 . with probability bigger than @xmath3 , @xmath10 is at the boundary of the convex hull . observe that for any @xmath9 the number of reflections out side of the convex hull is proportional to the number of all the reflections , which is order @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of the event @xmath63 , is up to a constant factor invariant with respect to @xmath56 and when @xmath56 reflects at @xmath59 , the event above holds by lemma  [ two convex sets ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath69",
    "@xmath38        since geodesic triangles in gromov hyperbolic graphs are @xmath24-thin , if @xmath62-inverse triangle inequality holds at @xmath59 , by gromov hyperbolicity , it has to be in a bounded neighborhood of the geodesic , depending only on the @xmath24-hyperbolicity and @xmath62 .",
