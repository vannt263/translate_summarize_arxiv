    "the european space agency herschel satellite will be launched at the end of 2008 with an ariane-5 rocket and will operate at the lagrangian l2 point of the sun - earth system ( see esa web page : _ www.rssd.esa.int/sa-general/projects/herschel_ ) .",
    "herschel is the esa fourth cornerstone mission and will perform imaging photometry and spectroscopy in the far infrared and submillimetre part of the spectrum .",
    "the herschel payload consists of two cameras / medium resolution spectrometers ( pacs and spire ) and a very high resolution heterodyne spectrometer ( hifi ) .",
    "the pacs ( photo - conductor array camera and spectrometer ) instrument will perform efficient imaging and photometry in three wavelength bands in the range 60210@xmath0 m , and spectroscopy and spectroscopic mapping with spectral resolution between 1000 and 2000 over the same wavelength range or short segments .",
    "pacs is made of four sets of detectors : two ge : ga photoconductor arrays for the spectrometer part and two si - bolometers for the photometer part . on each instrument side",
    "each detector covers roughly half of the pacs bandwidth .",
    "it is well known that cosmic rays may influence strongly the detector behaviour in space .",
    "the performances of infrared space observatory ( iso ) detectors were largely affected for time periods long enough to corrupt a large amount of data @xcite .",
    "our goal is to exploit our present knowledge about the detectors and the cosmic environment to understand how the detector behaviour changes and how we may retrieve the lost information and/or extract the astronomical signal from the sources through an appropriate data analysis tool .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the si - bolometer arrays of the pacs instrument .",
    "these detectors differ from those on board of iso as they are not of photoconducting type and very likely less affected by cosmic ray hitting . in a previous paper we dealt with the ge : ga photoconductors of the same instrument ( @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ simulations ] through [ pl ] , we briefly describe the used simulation toolkit , the input detector design , the galactic cosmic ray spectra and the physics list . in section [ checks ]",
    "we discuss very simple tests to check the reliability of the present simulations .",
    "the results are reported in section [ results ] and discussed in section [ discussion ] , while in section [ ipn ] we compare simulations with laboratory tests .",
    "conclusions about the effect on observations are to be found in [ conclusion ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations were carried out with the geant4 ( hereafter g4 ) toolkit , which simulates the passage of particles through matter .",
    "g4 provides a complete set of tools for all the domains of detector simulation : geometry , tracking , detector response , run , event and track management , visualization and user interface .",
    "an abundant set of physics processes handle the diverse interactions of particles with matter across a wide energy range , as required by the g4 multi - disciplinary nature ; for many physics processes a choice of different models is available . for any further information see the geant4 home page at : _",

    "the pacs camera is made of two bolometers : one called ` blue ' working at short wavelengths ( 60 - 130@xmath0 m ) and one ` red ' at long wavelengths ( 140 - 200@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the blue one consists of 8 chips ( @xmath1 ) , each of dimensions of 15.78@xmath212.63 mm and comprising @xmath3 pixels .",
    "the chips are separated from each other by 120 @xmath0 m and have a projected field of view in the sky of 1.75@xmath43.5@xmath5 .",
    "the red one is made of 2 chips covering the same sky area , each of dimensions of 12.63@xmath212.63 mm and comprising @xmath3 pixels .",
    "the detector module of the pacs bolometers is made of different parts : each pixel consists of an absorber supported by a silicon grid 5@xmath0 m thick with a thermometer , and is suspended in an inter - pixel - wall ( ipw ) grid 450@xmath0 m thick which has a reference thermometer and acts as a thermostat , of aluminum , titanium and silicon layers , of a silicon strip , and of reflecting slabs @xcite .",
    "the output signal is a function of the temperature difference between the pixels and the reference thermometers .",
    "figure [ bluereal ] shows a picture of the real pacs blue bolometer detectors , while figure [ blue ] shows how we have modeled their geometry .",
    "this last configuration is that used for for the simulations with the g4 software .",
    "details of the modeled geometry are given in appendix a.            the ensemble of all the components ` external ' to the detector , i.e. the pacs box , the cryostat and the spacecraft is hereafter called ` shield '",
    ". the dimensions of this latter have been chosen to be big enough to contain the pacs detectors .",
    "a detailed simulation should in principle include a model of the exact geometry of the spacecraft . for the pacs bolometer , however , we approximate the spacecraft , the cryostat and the telescope with an aluminum sphere , 11 mm thick and at a temperature of 80 k , which is the nominal temperature of the passively cooled herschel telescope .",
    "the inner radius of the shield is 20 cm and the outer radius 21.1 cm .",
    "this aluminum sphere corresponds to 15.7 kg , i.e. 5 percent of the telescope mass .",
    "we have carried out the same tests described in this paper by varying the telescope temperature from the 80 k value and it turns out that the results do not change .",
    "the g4 software then requires the design of a _ world volume _ containing all the detector parts and the specification of the environment in which the detector is placed .",
    "we made the _ world volume _ a little bit larger than the shield , i.e. a sphere with a 21.2 cm radius .",
    "herschel will be injected in a orbit around l2 . the galactic cosmic ray ( hereafter gcr ) rate in the l2 environment has been measured by the wmap satellite @xcite and found to be very close to that of the geostationary orbit , for which the gcr spectra are known .",
    "we use the cosmic ray effects on micro - electronics ( creme ) model set both for the solar - minimum ( gcrs maximum ) and for the solar - maximum environment @xcite .",
    "creme treats geosynchronous and near - earth interplanetary environments as identical , there is no geomagnetic shielding and no trapped particles",
    ". 5 mev / nuc , which are irrelevant for single - event effects . ] the creme interplanetary flux model ( galactic cosmic rays , anomalous cosmic rays , and solar energetic particles ) is based on measurements at earth ( 1 au ) .",
    "creme uses numerical models for the ionizing radiation environment in near - earth orbits to evaluate the resulting radiation effects on electronic systems in space .",
    "our simulations take into account the most common gcr particles in the near - earth heliosphere : protons , alpha particles and nuclei of li , c , n , o ( see figure [ gcr_sed ] ) .",
    "we had to neglect heavier ions as physical processes in geant4 lack a detailed comparison with experimental data and reliability .",
    "fe ion , although with an abundance lower of two order of magnitudes than that of oxygen may cause a big jump in the detector temperature because of its larger mass .",
    "the current version of g4 is not reliable to follow these processes and they are then neglected in this work . in table",
    "[ gcr_rates ] we report the rates ( number of particles per second ) of each gcr type considered , computed by integrating the fluxes shown in figure [ gcr_sed ] over the shield surface and particle energy .",
    "we have considered here that the detector is hit by the flux coming from all directions and that a herschel will reach the l2 point at a solar minimum but it will operate until an epoch of increasing solar activity . both phases of solar activities are thus considered .",
    ".rates ( number of nuclei per second hitting a sphere of 21.2 cm radius ) for different gcr types and solar activity levels .",
    "values reported here are the integrals of figure 3 . [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]     the experimental _ particle sum _",
    "value is slightly higher than that given by g4 .",
    "the difference can be ascribed to either 1 ) the cut values used in the simulations for the mylar and al layer placed in front of the detector which may be too large or 2 ) an underestimate of the solid angle for the rutherford diffusion .",
    "a decrease of the cut values would increase the number of secondary events , whereas a bigger solid angle would increase the primary event rate ( proton and alpha seeds ) . at present",
    "it is hard to decide which are the most appropriate modifications of simulation parameters .",
    "temporal behaviour can not be easily retrieved from the present simulations and in this case we exploit the shadowing effect of the beam cone ( see appendix c and figure [ shadoweffect ] ) to check for temperature variation as a function of the incoming flux .",
    "we have compared the pixels which were only slightly affected by the incoming beam ( maybe even not hit by any particle ) with those clearly subject to a strong bombardment .",
    "we report in figure [ mh ] the temperature variation along four imaginary cuts performed along the pixel matrix .",
    "the temperature varies by at most 15% for pixels receiving the largest number of hits .",
    "note that the number of hits on pixel columns 1 to 5 differ by a factor @xmath6 from that on columns 12 to 16 .",
    "this result was also found in the measurements and is due to the geometrical effect of the cone .",
    "pixel matrix , after subtracting the blind pixels : the two median sections ( vertical : x@xmath7=10 , upper panel ; horizontal y@xmath7=8 , second panel from the top ) and the two diagonal sections ( down - up : y@xmath7=@xmath8 - 2 , third panel from the top ; up - down : y@xmath7=18-@xmath8 bottom panel ) . in black",
    "the data referring to the experiment 3 setup , in red for exp . 4 , in green for exp . 5 and in blue for exp .",
    "the shadow effect is less present in the plot referring to the up - down diagonal , whose pixels suffer almost the same shadowing from the cone.,width=529,height=604 ]    these results show that the particles incoming on a pixel increase its temperature by up to 15% .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel variation yielded by our simulations , due to the increasing intensity of the beam , may be understood in terms of temporal behaviour of a single pixel under the effect of a cosmic particle .",
    "this may result in a slow responsivity drift , i.e. in a change of the response of the single pixel with a time scale depending on the bolometer time constant .",
    "* red bolometers are less affected by gcr glitches than the blue ones .",
    "the pixel grid of the red bolometer is a factor of 1.569 larger so that its heat capacity ( volumetric heat capacity times the volume ) is correspondingly higher for the red pixels .",
    "the number of impacts is proportional to the detector surface . both the red and the blue bolometer are affected by the same impinging flux but they have different collecting areas : 2048 grids for the blue and 512 grids for the red and the expected ratio of hit rate is : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the array areas of the blue and red bolometers respectively .",
    "* we have quantified the contribution of secondary events produced by the shield. this latter acts as the major source of secondary events , while the bolometer itself produces approximately 1/3 of them . *",
    "the sensitivity of the bolometer cameras may be limited by glitch impacts for very faint sources ; we expect a glitch contamination @xmath126% of the background . the contamination is lower for the red camera .",
    "* a test with the instrument simulator shows that in case of very faint sources a suitable observing technique and glitch removal algorithm must be put in place .",
    "in particular this latter should work on each chopping time interval in order to avoid false detections due to the sudden change of the flux level .",
