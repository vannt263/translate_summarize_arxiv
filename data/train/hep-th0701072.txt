    "the calculation of these coefficients has only recently been fully accomplished @xcite . introducing a suitable deformation of the adhm measure on the super - instanton moduli spaces which exploits the 4d chiral rotations symmetry of adhm constraints ,",
    "the resulting partition function can be computed using localization techniques and the topological twist of its supersymmetries .",
    "one has @xmath3 and @xmath4 yields the non - perturbative part of the sw prepotential . what about higher orders in the deformation parameter @xmath5 ?",

    "the proposal has been tested in @xcite .",
    "we will discuss how to reproduce the semiclassical instanton expansion of the low energy effective action for the @xmath0 sym theory via its microscopic string realization via ( fractional ) d3/d(-1 ) branes .",
    "we will then show that the inclusion of the graviphoton of the @xmath0 bulk sugra , which comes from the rr sector , produces in the effective action the gravitational f - terms which are computed by the topological string on local cy ; at the same time , it leads exactly to the localization deformation on the instanton moduli space which allows to perform the integration .",

    "we are interested in the l.e.e.a . on the coulomb branch parametrized by the v.e.v.s @xmath19 of the adjoint chiral superfields breaking @xmath20 ; we focus for simplicity on @xmath11 . up to two - derivatives , @xmath0 susy forces the effective action for the chiral multiplet @xmath21 in the cartan direction to be of the form @xmath22 =   \\int d^4x \\,d^4\\theta\\ , { \\mathcal{f}}({\\phi } ) + \\mathrm{c.c}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is called the prepotential of the theory .",
