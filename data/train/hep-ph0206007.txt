    "in the chiral su(2 ) limit ( @xmath8 ) the @xmath0 decay amplitude is precisely known to order @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the amplitude is @xmath10 in the low energy chiral counting .",
    "it is determined entirely by the anomaly induced on the divergence of the axial current @xmath11 by the electromagnetic interaction , and is expressed in terms of the only two available quantities  the fine structure constant @xmath9 and the pion decay constant @xmath12the decay width in this limit is thus given by @xmath13 .",
    "the explicit breaking of chiral @xmath14 symmetry induced by non - zero u- and d - quark masses generates corrections to the chiral limit result , and it is the purpose of the present work to evaluate these corrections as well as to understand their origin . in order to achieve this goal it it is crucial to perform the analysis in the extended framework of three flavors supplemented by the @xmath1 expansion in order to include explicitly the @xmath4 degree of freedom . in this three flavor framework",
    "the corrections turn out to be of two types :    * those due to isospin breaking ( mixing corrections ) that are proportional to @xmath15 or to @xmath16 , both giving contributions to the decay amplitude that , according to the counting defined in the next section , are @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ , of the same order as the leading term , and * those proportional to @xmath17 that are of subleading order@xmath2and which stem from different sources , as shown below .",
    "the inclusion of such corrections is crucial for a prediction of the @xmath18 width at the @xmath19 level , which is the level of theoretical precision required by the forthcoming dramatic improvement expected in the experimental measurement of the @xmath20 width via the primakoff effect .",
    "the primex experiment at jefferson lab @xcite is aiming at a measurement with an error about @xmath21 , which is several times smaller than the @xmath22 uncertainty in the current world - average value @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , this quoted experimental uncertainty is open to question as can be seen by the large dispersion of the experimental results which suggests that the errors of the individual experiments have been underestimated .",
    "indeed , a direct measurement gives @xmath24@xcite , a production experiment in @xmath25 collisions yields @xmath26@xcite , while primakoff effect experiments , all dating back to the early seventies , give disparate values : a large number@xmath27 @xcite , and two that are consistent with the current world average@xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this unsatisfactory experimental situation together with the rather precise theoretical prediction derived in the present work clearly lend great significance to the upcoming primex measurement .    within the two - flavor framework ,",
    "wherein the strange quark is integrated out , any corrections to the amplitude are @xmath2 and reside entirely in @xmath30 @xcite or in the @xmath2 odd - intrinsic parity chiral lagrangian@xcite , also known as the @xmath2 wess - zumino ( wz ) lagrangian . at leading order ,",
    "the ensuing theoretical prediction ( taking @xmath31 ) is @xmath32 , a result that agrees well with the experimental world average within its generous error .",
    "the analysis within @xmath33 , however , does not provide insight on the origin of the @xmath34 wz contribution just mentioned .",
    "such an insight _ can _ be gained by instead performing the analysis in the _",
    "three_-flavor framework , as has been shown by moussallam@xcite .",
    "in particular , he pointed out that the primary corrections to the @xmath20 width result from the leading order isospin breaking effects mentioned above in i ) , which stem from the @xmath35-induced mixing between the pure isospin state @xmath20 and pure @xmath36 states @xmath7 and @xmath4 ( to be denoted below by @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively )",
    ". the present work confirms that such isospin breaking corrections persist as the dominant effect when next to leading order ( nlo ) corrections are included .    in this work",
    "then the @xmath40 decay rate is evaluated to nlo within @xmath41 chiral perturbation theory wherein the @xmath4 meson is included consistently by means of the @xmath1 expansion since in the large @xmath42 limit the @xmath4 becomes a goldstone boson .",
    "such a framework was recently developed by herrera - sikldy , latorre , pascual and taron@xcite and by kaiser and leutwyler@xcite , who showed that a simultaneous chiral and @xmath1 expansion leads to an effective theory for the pseudoscalar nonet that is not only internally consistent but is also very useful in practice , as the present work shows .",
    "the chief result of our paper is that the @xmath40 width is enhanced by about @xmath43 from the lowest order chiral anomaly prediction , a result expected to hold within an uncertainty of @xmath44 after nlo contributions are included .",
    "the magnitude of this enhancement agrees with that obtained in the analysis of moussallam @xcite , where the nlo corrections were not implemented in a consistent fashion , as done in the present work .",
    "the decay amplitudes of @xmath20 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 into two photons can be obtained from the ward identities satisfied by the three axial vector currents @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , where @xmath47 are @xmath5 generators ( @xmath48 being the @xmath49 generator ) normalized via @xmath50 . in the presence of the strong and electromagnetic interactions , the divergence of the axial vector current",

    "ignoring such effects implies that only nlo corrections which are absorbed into the @xmath20 decay constant remain , as it was shown in @xcite ; in that case and taking @xmath31 , the predicted @xmath20 width is the previously mentioned @xmath78 .",
    "as shown here , however , disregarding mixing in particular constitutes a very poor approximation . in the presence of mixing the pseudoscalar decay constants form a @xmath79 matrix defined by the matrix elements of the axial vector currents , which connect the pseudoscalar mesons to the vacuum : @xmath80 indeed this decay - constant matrix contains all that is needed to calculate the three two - photon amplitudes , except the contributions stemming from the @xmath10 wz lagrangian , and its evaluation is the centerpiece of the present work .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the present analysis includes the @xmath4 as an explicit degree of freedom , which , in order to be consistently implemented in an effective theory , requires the validity of the @xmath1 expansion , wherein , taking the chiral @xmath81 limit , @xmath82 .",
    "thus , in the framework of the @xmath1 expansion @xmath83 should be considered as `` small , '' and its explicit inclusion becomes consistent with having a simultaneous low energy chiral expansion .",
    "this explicit inclusion of the @xmath4 in the low energy expansion implies that @xmath83 must count as a quantity of @xmath84 , which in turn implies that @xmath1 should be counted as a quantity of the same order .",

    "this fit yields then @xmath112 , which is substantially larger than the value @xcite @xmath113 that arises in the limit @xmath114 , when only octet degrees of freedom are included .",
    "the lo mass matrix , however , gives a poor result for the masses .",
    "in particular the @xmath7 mass is too low by almost 50 mev , a problem that is generic at lo in the low energy and @xmath1 expansions@xcite .    using the relations @xmath115 which connect the decay amplitudes and associated widths , the fitted parameters at lo lead to a @xmath0 decay width of 8.08 ev , which is @xmath43 larger than the leading order result @xmath116 obtained in the two - flavor framework wherein mixing effects are moved to nlo .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the two - photon widths of the @xmath7 and @xmath4 predicted in this leading order fit are too large , the first being 22% and the second 20% larger than the corresponding experimental values .",
    "one of the chief reasons for this disagreement is that @xmath36 breaking in the pseudoscalar decay constants is not included at lo .",
    "the @xmath76 mixing angle @xmath75 turns out to be @xmath117 at lo , and will be reduced by almost a factor of two when nlo corrections are included .",

    "it is important to note that the corrections due to mixing with @xmath7 and with @xmath4 are of the same sign and of similar magnitude .",
    "this point is the primary reason why the @xmath4 _ must _ be explicitly included for a full understanding of the mixing effects .",
    "although @xmath121 mixing is smaller than the @xmath122 mixing , the bare singlet state has an intrinsic two - photon amplitude larger by a factor @xmath123 that compensates for the smaller mixing .",
    "overall , however , the lo fit is poor , and dramatic improvement results when the nlo corrections are included , as shown in the following section .",
    "at nlo the amplitudes receive corrections of two types  those that affect the decay constants and mixing angles , and those that stem from the presence of excited states and which are included in the @xmath2 wz lagrangian .",
    "the first type of correction requires the determination of the masses and decay constants to nlo and can be obtained in the standard fashion by calculating the two - point functions of axial vector currents , where the relevant diagrams are shown in fig .",

    "it is important to note that the singlet axial current has non - vanishing anomalous dimension @xcite , which implies that some low energy constants ( lecs ) as well as the singlet field @xmath39 must be renormalized ( the corresponding renormalized quantities will thus depend on the qcd renormalization scale @xmath130 ) @xcite .",

    "this correction has been studied @xcite and is given by @xmath246 where the low energy constants that determine the coefficient @xmath247 can be estimated in a resonance saturation model that gives @xmath248 , thus leading to the estimate @xmath249 which is well within the experimental uncertainty in the value of @xmath206 , and implies a correction to the @xmath20 width consistent with the range mentioned above .",
    "it seems , therefore , safe to neglect electromagnetic corrections at the level of precision of this work .",
    "although the @xmath76 complex is not the primary focus of this work , the analysis carried out illuminates crucial aspects of this system . at",
    "lo the description is rather poor , in particular because the two - photon widths depart quite substantially from the experimental world averages .",
    "indeed , @xmath250 versus the world average experimental value of @xmath251 , and @xmath252 vs @xmath253 .",
    "these latter disagreements are mostly due to the large @xmath76 mixing angle that results from the lo mass formulas , and the fact that at lo all decay constants are set to be equal to @xmath12 . at nlo",
    "the scheme that emerges is the one already found in other works @xcite , where the mixing angle of the pure @xmath5 states is in the proximity of @xmath237 rather than the @xmath254 obtained in lo , and where the decay constant matrix can be parametrized by means of two angles and two decay constants @xcite .",
    "following the conventions and notation in@xcite , the present analysis gives ( quantities are denoted in boldface not to be confused with quantities defined heretofore in the text ) : @xmath255 mev , @xmath256 mev , @xmath257 @xmath258 , and the angles @xmath259 and @xmath260 for the three nlo fits are respectively @xmath261 , @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "the difference @xmath264 turns out to be between @xmath265 and @xmath266 , to be compared with the @xmath265 obtained in @xcite ( in a nlo estimate in that reference a value of @xmath267 is obtained , which departs substantially from the one of the current analysis ) .",
    "there exist numerous studies of the @xmath76 complex .",
    "it makes sense only to compare results with those using the two - angle scheme @xcite .",
    "although some of the analyses in these references are purely phenomenological , these results are in general in good agreement with the results obtained in this work .",
    "the quark mass ratios obtained in the different fits deserve comment .",
    "the ratio @xmath268 is in good agreement with the standard value @xmath269 obtained in su(3 ) @xcite ; in fit # 2 it is a couple of standard deviations smaller , most likely because the chiral logarithms included do not represent the full nnlo contributions . in all",
    ", this is not surprising as the assumption that the low energy constants that are subleading in @xmath1 can be disregarded is one of the important assumptions in the extraction of the standard ratios .",
    "however , a comment is in order : it is observed that using lo mass formulas in the nlo results _i.e_. , expressing quark masses in terms of meson masses squared in the nlo terms  leads to a fit that is less stable and generates large corrections to the quark mass ratios .",
    "the ratio @xmath205 is smaller here than the standard value @xmath270 , and this is simply because the corrections to dashen s theorem have been included .",
    "the values for @xmath205 in fits # 1 and # 3 are about one standard deviation smaller than the standard value , while in # 2 the chiral logarithms involving the @xmath4 loops give a substantial reduction ( when these are turned off @xmath205 is similar to the result in the other fits ) .",
    "an interesting observation is that setting @xmath271 leads to an inconsistent fit and a value for the @xmath20 width of 8.5 ev .",
    "the decay rate for @xmath272 has been calculated within a combined chiral and @xmath1 expansion . at leading order in the expansion ,",
    "the isospin - breaking induced mixing of the pure @xmath5 states increases the size of @xmath273 from the value @xmath274 ev predicted by the lowest order chiral anomaly by more than 4.5% .",
    "this effect is largely due to the fact that the contributions from mixing with the @xmath38 and @xmath39 add constructively , and are of similar magnitude .",
    "however , at lo the resulting @xmath275 widths are found to be too large , and in general the fit is quite poor .",
    "there is a clear need then for the nlo calculation , both in order to improve the results in the @xmath76 sector and to test the stability of the enhancement of @xmath273 observed at lo .",
    "the nlo calculation reveals that the lo result for @xmath273 is quite robust , being modified by the nlo corrections by less than 1% .",
    "this stability is , however , non - trivial . indeed ,",
    "as already noted , at nlo the mixing angles are substantially affected  the mixing angles @xmath276 and @xmath234 are reduced by 10 to 30% ( a more dramatic reduction of roughly 50% results for the mixing angle @xmath75 ) . the @xmath20 width ,",
    "however , is only slightly affected because the effects that ultimately determine the corrections to the amplitude are in the decay constant matrix @xmath239 shown in eq .",
    "this matrix is affected by the mixing , and also receives nlo corrections that reside in @xmath175 , and apparently the nlo modifications to the mixings are partially compensated by the latter corrections in the case of the entries relevant to the @xmath20 .",
    "the primary source of theoretical uncertainty in the present calculation of @xmath273 resides in the value of @xmath205 , which has an uncertainty of about 15% . using the empirical formula resulting from the results in table ii , @xmath277 , the uncertainty in @xmath205 translates into an error in the @xmath20 width of @xmath278 .",
    "other sources of uncertainty are the nnlo corrections , of which the chiral - logs are an example , and which should be expected to be in the range of @xmath227 , and also em corrections which according to a straightforward estimate should be in a similar range .",
    "all this together implies an uncertainty of less than @xmath224 in the theoretical prediction of @xmath273 .",
    "note that there is an overall uncertainty in @xmath273 due to the 0.3% error in @xmath206 .",
    "the fact that the theoretical prediction for @xmath273 shows the 4.5% enhancement that can be experimentally observed , and the fact that the experimental result with the smallest quoted error @xcite lies more than three standard deviations below that prediction lend great significance to the upcoming primex measurement .",
    "it is evident from the above analysis that no predictions for the @xmath7 and @xmath4 two - photon widths can be made .",
    "rather , these quantities are inputs , and their precise values do not affect in any dramatic way the @xmath20 width . in a more complete study , wherein the analysis is extended to additional processes such as @xmath279 , a more precise experimental knowledge of such widths would be necessary .",
    "a more extensive analysis would also illuminate the @xmath1 corrections encoded in the lecs @xmath131 and @xmath132 and help determine them more precisely .",
    "as this manuscript was being completed an analysis by ananthanarayan and moussallam @xcite was posted where the electromagnetic corrections are studied in detail .",
    "their result for the @xmath20 rate is in agreement with the results in this work .",
    "related work is also being completed by kaiser and leutwyler @xcite .",
