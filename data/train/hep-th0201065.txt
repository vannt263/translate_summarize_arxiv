    "we propose a new non - perturbative analysis of quenched qed beyond the infrared bloch nordsieck approximation using the world line formalism .",
    "the main idea is to formulate evolution equations in the proper time , inspired by the rather intuitive resulting classical picture . as a warm up we obtain in a simple way the",
    "renormalized quenched propagator in the infrared ( ir ) limit .",
    "from there we procced to improve on this ir approximation , which we achieve in the form of integro  differential equations , our main results .",
    "they are of course difficult to solve , but they have an appealing physical interpretation and suggest a simplified numerical analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ infrared ] we study the infrared behavior of lepton propagators for several cases .",
    "first we consider the bloch nordsieck approximation as given by uniform proper time paths , which exhibit the classical image in the worldline .",
    "this suggests the use of the proper time evolution equations as a short cut to go beyond the infrared approximation .",
    "the idea is carried out for scalar qed and then for the full dirac algebra .",
    "the lesson of this section is a better understanding of renormalization and the fact that the scalar case contains the basic physics , which will be used in the next section , section [ beyond ] where , we develop further the proper time formalism to go beyond the infrared limit . the results are summarized in section [ conclu ] devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in this section we will study the classical block  nordsieck approximation and their extensions for scalar and fermionic qed .",
    "our main point is given in equation ( [ evol1 ] ) , where an evolution equation is introduced for the quenched propagator .",
    "its solution is the well  known block  nordsieck result .",
    "the extensions to the scalar and full dirac algebra are carried out without difficulty .",
    "the bloch  nordsieck model has been repeatedly used to study the infrared behavior of qed . here we will consider it from the path integral point of view as a convenient starting point . the model has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite    in the bloch  nordsieck model one substitutes the dirac s gamma matrices by a constant vector @xmath0 .",
    "this constant vector will be identified to the ( constant ) velocity of the electron , see below . with this substitution",
    "the model is completely integrable and the electron green function can be cast in terms of elementary functions .",
    "the electron propagator in the bloch  nordsieck approximation is given by @xmath1 g(x , y ) = -\\delta(x - y),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the electromagnetic potential .",
    "we will solve this model by introducing a proper time ( schwinger s method @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "define @xmath3 then @xmath4 verifies the equation @xmath5 g(\\tau , x , y ) = { \\cal h } g(\\tau , x , y ) , \\label{bn_equ}\\ ] ] with initial conditions @xmath6 the formal solution is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is clearly seen as a hamiltonian which gives the evolution in the proper time of the schrdinger  like equation .",
    "this formal expression can be cast into a path integral in the proper time .",
    "we can write @xmath9 the electromagnetic field is coupled to the current @xmath10 and can be integrated out , since the resulting integral is gaussian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a gauge  fixing parameter and the brackets @xmath13 mean the average over the gauge fields .",
    "the integration of the @xmath14 fields gives a non - local lagrangian for @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 is the photon propagator in the gauge @xmath12 .",
    "the integral over @xmath18 gives a delta function , @xmath19 , which implies that the particle moves with constant velocity , @xmath20 , as stated previously .",
    "we see that the electron in the bloch  nordsieck approximation behaves as a classical particle , the only path that contributes to the propagator is the classical path and quantum fluctuations are _ exactly _ canceled .",
    "this fact is most easily seen in the above formalism .",
    "the triviality of the quantum corrections is due to the appearance of the delta function , which in turn is related to the triviality of the classical hamiltonian . for the bn model ,",
    "the classical path and the uniform velocity path coincide , independently of the external potential , @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively one may notice that the eq.([bn_equ ] ) is first order on the variable @xmath21 .",
    "as is well known from the theory of partial differential equations , the solution admits a particle interpretation .",
    "this is not true for the cases considered below .",
    "the uniform path is only an approximation valid when the momentum interchanged with the gauge fields is sufficiently small such that the path can be considered uniform , _ i.e. _ in the infrared domain .",
    "therefore the non - local term must be evaluated in the classical path alone .",
    "it gives @xmath22 after renormalization we find @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "integrating over @xmath25 , we obtain finally @xmath26 this is the well  known bloch  nordsieck result . in the yennie - suura gauge , @xmath27",
    ", the electron propagator reduces to the free case . notice that @xmath28 verifies the homogeneous evolution equation @xmath29 which has of course the eq.([bn_end ] ) above as a solution .",
    "this fact will be used later on to go beyond the infrared approximation .      before considering the spinor electrodynamics , let s study the somewhat simpler case of scalar qed .",
    "we will study in detail the renormalization for this case .",
    "the scalar propagator , coupled to the electromagnetic current , is given by @xmath30 as before we introduce the schwinger proper time @xmath31 @xmath4 has the solution @xmath32 which can be expressed as a path integral @xmath33 now @xmath18 appears quadratically and the integral over it is no longer a delta function .",
    "as expected , the classical path is not the only contribution to the path integral and quantum corrections are relevant .",
    "however , for the moment , we will consider the contribution given by the uniform path alone , as the main contribution in the infrared limit .",
    "we first shift the momentum integral @xmath34 @xmath35 and as before , the electromagnetic field is coupled to the current @xmath36 .",
    "the average over gauge fields gives therefore , the same non local term @xmath37 now , we make the uniform path approximation , @xmath38 const . which gives @xmath39 integrating over @xmath25 and @xmath40 gives @xmath41 the integral is ir finite , at low momentum the divergent denominator cancels out with the @xmath42 in the numerator .",
    "we will renormalize the ultraviolet divergent @xmath43 integral using dimensional regularization , expanding around four dimensions , @xmath44 , we obtain @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the scalar propagator can be written @xmath48 expanding the exponential in powers of @xmath49 we obtain @xmath50 each term in the series can be integrated and gives @xmath51 the @xmath52th term can be written as the @xmath52-th power of @xmath53 expanding now in powers of @xmath54 we arrive at @xmath55 and we can choose the counterterms in such a way to cancel the term @xmath56 .",
    "the scalar propagator after renormalization is given by @xmath57 which coincides with the block - nordsieck result , as expected .",
    "notice that care has to be taken in the order of the limit @xmath58 and the integral over @xmath25 .",
    "we will see next that including the dirac algebra is under control , this will allow us to go back to the scalar case for the purposes of the present article .      including the full dirac algebra is far from trivial .",
    "it has been done in references @xcite .",
    "we will follow the method of ref.@xcite .",
    "the dirac equation is @xmath59 introducing the proper time as before , ( see eq.(6 ) from ref.@xcite ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a grassman variable . introducing a set of auxiliary grassman variables",
    "@xmath63 we can write a path integral for the propagator @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath63 verifies the boundary conditions @xmath66 . shifting the momentum as before and integrating the resulting gaussian integral over @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 $ ] is given by @xmath70= \\int_0^t d\\tau ( -\\frac{1}{2 } \\dot x^2",
    "+ i \\xi \\dot \\xi - i e f_{\\mu \\nu } \\xi^\\mu \\xi^\\nu -\\frac{1}{t } \\dot x \\xi \\chi ) -i",
    "\\xi(0 ) \\xi(t).\\ ] ] as before the gauge fields appear linearly only and the integration over them can be done exactly .",
    "@xmath71 where the action @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 @xmath74 and so on .",
    "we will calculate the action for the uniform path , as done before .    from the classical equations of movement for the free case ( @xmath75 ) we get that the uniform path in our case is given by @xmath76 introducing this solution in the path integral and",
    "after some algebra we arrive at @xmath77 where @xmath14 is given as before integrating over @xmath62 and applying the @xmath78 we arrive at @xmath79 if we set @xmath75 we obviously reproduce the free fermion propagator . for @xmath80 care",
    "must be taken in the regularization procedure since the integration over @xmath81 and the limit @xmath58 do not commute . if we boldly take the limit first and integrate we arrive at @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the renormalization constant @xmath84    taking correctly the limit after the integration we arrive at @xmath85 which is again the block  nordsieck result and reproduces the ir logs upon expansion on powers of @xmath86 .",
    "we will now write down the evolution equations for a scalar coupled to a scalar field . we will use this simpler case to demonstrate that the evolution equations allow us to go beyond the infrared domain .",
    "the obvious next step would be to construct evolution equations whose perturbative expansion give exact results up to a given order .",
    "let s start by writing down equations valid up to first order . further generalizations to the spinor case and higher orders will be left for future work .",
    "as before we start with the scalar propagator as given in eq.([scalar_prop ] ) in the proper time formalism , but now for a scalar field coupled to a scalar field @xmath87 .",
    "the propagator verifies the evolution equation @xmath88 g(\\tau , x , y),\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the coupling constant to the scalar field @xmath90 .",
    "we want to average over the field @xmath91 with a weight given by the free action .",
    ". therefore we get @xmath94 in the infrared limit the average @xmath95 is simply given by @xmath96 , as shown above by eq.([evol1 ] ) .",
    "but in general it can obviously not be written as a simple operator acting on @xmath97 .",
    "so one has to estimate the value of @xmath95 by introducing as before a path integral representation for @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 then @xmath99 introducing the current @xmath100 the average can be written @xmath101 where the derivative is evaluated at @xmath102 .",
    "the integral over @xmath91 is gaussian an after performing the functional derivative we arrive at @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the free scalar propagator of field @xmath91 .",
    "this expression can be simplified further if we make some approximations and constitutes the starting point to obtain evolution equations . to start with one",
    "can neglect the non  local term in the exponential since it is order @xmath105 .",
    "then it is straightforward to evaluate the functional integral since all integrals are gaussian .",
    "after some algebra we arrive at @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "the integral over @xmath21 can be done and gives now a delta function @xmath108 , i.e. the path is still uniform but now presents a jump at @xmath109 where the momentum changes from @xmath18 to @xmath110 .",
    "the electron emits a hard photon of momentum @xmath111 .",
    "evaluating the action at this specific path gives the total contribution , in this approximation @xmath112 we have separated the contributions from @xmath113 and @xmath114 to make it clear that they are both the free scalar propagators , i.e. @xmath115 this result is valid up to first order on @xmath89 .",
    "then the evolution equation , valid up to this order is @xmath116 the solution of this equation up to order @xmath105 gives the exact one loop scalar propagator , as it should .",
    "a natural extension of this result would be to change the free propagators , @xmath117 , in the integral by the exact ones @xmath97 with the hope that the main higher order contributions will be included in this way .",
    "we arrive , therefore , to our final evolution equation @xmath118 the solution of this equation gives the exact result up to first order .",
    "we think that higher orders are approximately taken into account . in the infrared limit",
    ", the equation reduces to the block - nordsieck case .",
    "we have arrived at an expression for the quenched propagator beyond the infrared domain .",
    "it has a clear physical interpretation as one can see by looking at the diagrams resummed by the above equation . from direct inspection",
    ", one sees that the vertex function is evaluated exactly at the one loop level , and that there are an infinity number of such hard loops .",
    "therefore , hard photons do not connect propagators with different hard vertex , _",
    "i.e. _ we have some kind of rainbow expansion , where overlapping loops are not included , as shown by fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "but there are in addition an infinity number of infrared photons which join any two points in the propagator and make the infrared limit exact . since the proper time in the diagram is related to the virtuality of the propagator and we have , in the above equation , an integral from 0 to the upper limit @xmath25 , we expect that higher order loops are calculated only up to some minimum virtuality , _",
    "i.e. _ one expects an ordering in the virtuality of the diagrams that contribute to the above equation .",
    "new insights in the nonperturbative regime are always welcome , even if quenched . in fact , better understanding of quenched approximations are essential for lattice simulations .",
    "the non - positron approximation is also useful in analytic attempts to fundamental problems , like stability of relativistic qed , where renormalization is one of the main problems @xcite .",
    "our result in eq.([final_evol ] ) can have many practical applications like a systematic way to calculate hard loop corrections with exponentiation of soft photons .",
    "they will depend on our ability to solve or approximate analytically the above equation .",
    "of course eq.([final_evol ] ) constitutes a new approach and can serve in any case as a starting point for new numerical analysis .",
