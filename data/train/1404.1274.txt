    "in the study of numeration systems with non - integer base , after the golden ratio , probably the most attention was given to its first generalization , the so - called tribonacci constant @xmath5 , the real root of @xmath4 .",
    "multiplication in systems corresponding to was studied grabner et al .",
    "@xcite and later messaoudi @xcite , providing bounds on the number of fractional digits of the product of two similar results for addition were obtained in @xcite",
    ".    an important characteristics of a numeration system is the so - called finiteness property ( f ) , namely that the set of finite expansions forms a ring .",
    "property ( f ) for @xmath5-expansions follows from a general result by frougny and solomyak @xcite .",
    "this has an interesting consequence for proving connectedness of certain discrete planes @xcite .",
    "numeration systems with negative non - integer base @xmath0 received a non - negligible attention since the paper [ 8 ] of ito and sadahiro in 2009 .",
    "certain arithmetic aspects seem to be analogous to those for positive base systems @xcite . however , the construction of concrete algorithms is much more complicated in the former case",
    ". this might be due to the fact that while @xmath1-expansions are lexicographicaly greatest among all the representations of a given number , the @xmath6-expansions are not extremal with respect to neither lexicographical nor alternate lexicographical ordering , which is more natural for negative base , see  @xcite .",
    "for example , in positive base systems , property ( f ) has been proven for large classes of pisot numbers @xcite . on the other hand , so far the only numbers known to possess analogous property ( -f ) are negative bases @xmath7 where @xmath1 is a root of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the main results of this paper are proving property ( -f ) for zeros @xmath11 of @xmath12 , and an explicit description of a finite state transducer performing addition and subtraction in negative tribonacci base @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of such a transducer was proved in [ 5 ] for any negative pisot base .",
    "however , the proof is not constructive , and does not provide any simple procedure to construct such a transducer for a specific base .",
    "this result has implications for the possibility of modelling certain related sets in the frame of the so called cut - and project scheme , see  @xcite .",
    "we also give a precise bound on the number of fractional digits arising from addition and subtraction of @xmath14-integers .",
    "the _ @xmath6-expansions _ considered by ito - sadahiro in @xcite are an analogue of introduced by rnyi in @xcite , which use a negative base . instead of defining the expansions of numbers from @xmath15 , the unit interval @xmath16 with @xmath17 was chosen . for @xmath0 ,",
    "any @xmath18 has a unique expansion of the form @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 for any @xmath18 we obtain an infinite word from @xmath21 .",
    "another analogous concept is the _",
    "@xmath6-admissibility _ , which characterizes all digit strings over @xmath22 that are @xmath6-expansion of some number .",
    "the lexicographic condition , similar to the one by parry , was also proved in  @xcite .",
    "ito and sadahiro proved that a digit string @xmath23 is _",
    "@xmath6-admissible _ ( or , if no confusion is possible , just admissible ) if and only if it fulfills the lexicographic condition @xmath24 here , the limit is taken over the product topology on @xmath25 and @xmath26 stands for _ alternate lexicographic ordering _ defined as follows : @xmath27 in analogy with @xmath1-numeration , the alternate ordering corresponds to the ordering on reals in @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath28 .    the reference digit strings @xmath29 and @xmath30 play the same role for @xmath6-expansions as rnyi expansions of unity for @xmath1-expansions .",
    "while @xmath29 is obtainable directly from the definition , the following rule ( proved in  @xcite ) can be used for determining @xmath30 : @xmath31    when @xmath32 is zero of @xmath12 , we have @xmath33 the lexicographic condition is @xmath34 therefore the sequences from @xmath25 with substrings @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , are not admissible .",
    "conversely , any sequence not containing those substrings is admissible .",

    "since the base is negative , we can represent any real number without the need of a minus sign .",

    "one can verify that the transitions defined below do not change the numerical value of the input string since the right side is obtained by adding a representations of zero .",
    "that is , if @xmath148 then @xmath149 can be obtained from @xmath150 by adding the strings @xmath151 or @xmath152 ( possibly two times ) .",
    "moreover , with one exception , the transitions from any state are defined for any input letter from @xmath153 the exception is the state @xmath154 that can not be escaped by reading symbol @xmath155 nevertheless , the only path to the state @xmath154 leads from @xmath156 by reading the string @xmath157 on the input ( see figure  [ subgraph ] ) .",
    "reading @xmath67 would mean that both @xmath41 and @xmath69 contain forbidden string @xmath68 .",
    "therefore we assume that at least one summand does not contain @xmath158    [ priklad ] we will show how @xmath60 acts on the number @xmath159 first , we add the leading factor @xmath160 and the tailing factor @xmath161 to the representation .",
