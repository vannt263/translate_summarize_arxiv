    "several ancilla qubits will be required , their number depending on the desired precision for the coefficients @xmath159 that specify @xmath160 .",
    "the first steps are to load an initial state @xmath161 into the accumulator and to form an equal superposition of all index qubit states , giving a complete state , @xmath162 the state @xmath163 is an initial estimate of the field eigenvector of interest .",
    "to determine the required computational work to arrive at a suitable initial estimate @xmath163 , it is useful to decompose the accumulator state in terms of the initially unknown eigenstates @xmath164 , @xmath165 . as will be shown",

    "our analysis of the abrams - lloyd algorithm raises several questions .",
    "firstly , it is natural to ask what sort of qubit phase rotation accuracy is required during the application of @xmath203 to the initial guess eigenstate .",
    "the phase that is applied to qubits by the operator @xmath203 during the computation is of the same order as the phase applied to the highest order eigenvector : @xmath362 where the eigenvalue @xmath363 for a differential operator of order @xmath0 and @xmath364 for a second order splitting formula .",
    "the magnitude of the phase rotations applied to qubits is therefore @xmath365 .",
    "the relative accuracy with which the phase must be applied is @xmath3 if the final eigenvalue estimation is to be accurate to the truncation error limit of @xmath3 .",
    "thus the absolute accuracy required from single qubit rotations is @xmath366 , independent of the number of dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "the absolute accuracy is a small quantity for very modest values of @xmath367 ( representing a relative eigenvalue accuracy of @xmath368 ) with a second order operator ( @xmath369 ) .",
    "angular resolution of @xmath370 in the control of qubits represents a technical feat , but thankfully the principles of fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite can be applied here to lessen the accuracy requirements for _ physical qubit _ operations .    secondly , it is tempting to compare the quantum and classical algorithms for the simulation of dynamical evolution .",
    "the abrams - lloyd algorithm simulates the dynamics of the schrdinger equation @xmath371 for some ( possibly fictitious ) hamiltonian represented by @xmath33 , but only limited detail of the dynamics in a quantum simulation are accessible .",
    "the probability amplitudes characterizing a register of @xmath372 qubits can result in at most @xmath373 classical bits of information being extracted by measurement ( by the holevo bound ) .",
    "for instance , in order to obtain the eigenvector coefficients @xmath72 , at least @xmath374 iterations of the algorithm would be required .",
    "this is in contrast to a classical simulation of dynamical evolution where @xmath375 bits would be required to store a state at a single dynamical step , and @xmath376 bits are required to store the entire evolution of an initial state over @xmath27 dynamical steps .",
    "we emphasize that the strength of the abrams - lloyd algorithm is not in its ability to provide great detail into dynamical evolution but rather in extracting useful classical information ( such as eigenvalues ) from a very compact representation of that dynamical evolution .",
    "finally , the analysis of the abrams - lloyd algorithm raises the question as to why the eigenvalue convergence for low dimensional problems ( ie .",
    "small @xmath2 ) is less than that of optimal classical approaches .",
    "part of the answer lies in the classical theory of matrix eigenvalue calculation .",
    "an important tool for numerical estimation of eigenvalues is the krylov subspace , which is defined to be the span of the set @xmath377 for some initial guess vector @xmath378 , some hopefully small constant @xmath379 , and some @xmath343 matrix @xmath380 of which we seek several low order eigenvalues .",
    "the krylov subspace is spanned by at most @xmath381 vectors , rather than the full @xmath327 vector space of @xmath380 , and so projecting onto the krylov subspace gives an efficient means of estimating eigenvalues / eigenvectors of @xmath380 .",
    "if the matrix whose lowest eigenvalue is sought is @xmath156 , then we might choose @xmath382 where @xmath383 is an initial estimate of the eigenvalue sought ( the eigenvalues of @xmath156 being simply related to those of @xmath380 ) .",
    "with @xmath382 , the vector @xmath384 converges exponentially towards the eigenvector @xmath72 whose eigenvalue minimizes @xmath385 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath386 as in the abrams - lloyd algorithm , there is no such convergence towards a target eigenvector since the eigenvalues of @xmath380 are of unit norm .",
    "the unitarity of quantum gates restricts eigenvalues to lie on the unit circle in the complex plane , which is a poor eigenvalue distribution from the perspective of estimating a target eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "this leads to the question of whether controlled decoherence can be used to produce non - unitarity evolution to accelerate the selection of a target eigenvector _ with a net reduction in gate operations / delay_.    we thank chris anderson , oscar p. boykin , salman habib , colin williams , seth lloyd , joseph f. traub and isaac chuang for stimulating discussions and useful suggestions .",
