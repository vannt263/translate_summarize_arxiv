    "such an event would imply that modes c and d have initially contained five or more photons , and hence have not been in the n00n state .",

    "a more general scheme , capable of detecting the n00n state with an arbitrary even @xmath0 , involves applying operator @xmath59 to it .",

    "<S> the degree of entanglement , and hence the super - resolution potential of the n00n states dramatically degrades to an extent that eliminates any advantage @xcite .    in the present work , </S>",
