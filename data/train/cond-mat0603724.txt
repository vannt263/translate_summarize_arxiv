    "nonequilibrium systems have been used to describe a variety of problems in physics , chemistry , biology and other areas .",
    "different classes of nonequilibrium systems have been studied and a special attention has been devoted to systems with absorbing states . the most studied system with absorbing states is the contact process ( cp ) @xcite .",
    "the basic cp is composed of spontaneous annihilation of particles and creation of particles in empty sites provided they have at least one nearest neighbor site occupied by a particle .",
    "the critical behavior of cp belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been aplied for describing the cp , such as numerical simulations @xcite , continuous description by means of a langevin equation @xcite , renormalization group @xcite and series expansions @xcite .",
    "very accurate estimates for the critical point and critical exponents have been obtained for the basic cp model .",
    "however for the models that concern us here , the avaiable results come from only numerical simulations",
    ". the use of different tecniques may be a useful tool for studying the behavior of systems whose avaiable results are controversial .    in this paper",
    ", we developed subcritical perturbative series expansions for the steady state properties of a class of one - dimensional nonequilibrium models characterized by catalytic creation of particles in the presence of @xmath0-mers .",
    "we have considered here creation of particles in the presence of pairs of particles ( @xmath1 ) and triplet of particles ( @xmath2 ) . to exemplify , we developed the series expansion for three nonequilibrium models : the pair - creation contact process ( pccp ) @xcite , the a - pair - creation contact process ( apccp ) , which is closely related to the pccp , except that an empty site in the presence of at least a pair of particles becomes occupied with rate @xmath3 ( in the pccp it becomes occupied with rate @xmath4 times the number of pairs of adjacent particles ) , and the triplet - creation contact process ( tccp)@xcite . very precise estimates of the critical behavior and critical exponents are obtained from the analysis of the series .",
    "we compared our results with their respective numerical simulations .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath5 sites .",
    "the system envolves in the time according to a markovian process with local and irreversible rules .",
    "the time evolution of the probability @xmath6 of a given configuration @xmath7 is given by the master equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 . the total rate @xmath10 of the interacting models studied here is composed of two parts @xmath11 where the rates @xmath12 and @xmath13 take into account the annihilation and the catalytic creation of particles , respectively .",
    "the annihilation of a single particle is illustrated by the scheme @xmath14 , and the catalytic creation of particles by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for the pccp and tccp , respectively .",
    "the scheme for the apccp is similar to the pccp , but here if an empty site has at least one pair of adjacent particles , a new particle will be created with rate @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely these rules are given by @xmath17 for the annihilation subprocess , and @xmath13 by @xmath18 for the pccp , @xmath19 for the apccp , and @xmath20 for the tccp .    before developing the series expansion , it is necessary to write down the master equation in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the base states corresponding to a given site @xmath21 of the lattice are @xmath22 with @xmath23 or @xmath24 according to whether site @xmath21 is vacant or occupied by a particle , respectively .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators for the site @xmath21 are defined in the following manner @xmath25 and @xmath26 and they satisfy the property @xmath27 .    introducing the probability vector @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 ) in to eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) and using eqs .",
    "( [ creation ] ) and ( [ annihilation ] ) , the time evolution for the probability vector is given by , @xmath30 where the operator @xmath31 is a sum of the unperturbed term @xmath32 and a perturbed term @xmath33 . the operator @xmath34 , that takes into account only the annihilation subprocess , is a nontinteraction term , given by @xmath35 each term of the summation has the following set of right and left eigenvectors @xmath36 with eigenvalue @xmath37 and @xmath38 with eigenvalue @xmath39 .",
    "the operator @xmath40 , correspondint to the catalytic creation of particles , is an interacting term , given by @xmath41 for the pccp , @xmath42 for the apccp , and @xmath43 for the tccp , where the operator @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the operator number .    to find the steady vector @xmath47 , that satisfies the steady condition @xmath48",
    ", we assume that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the steady solution of the non - interacting term @xmath34 satisfying the stationary condition @xmath51 the vectors @xmath52 can be generated recursively from the initial state @xmath53 . following dickman @xcite ,",
    "we get the following recursion relation @xmath54 is the inverse of @xmath34 in the subspace of vectors with nonzero eigenvalues and given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are right and left eigenvectors of @xmath34 , respectively , with nonzero eigenvalue @xmath58 .",
    "we notice that the steady solution of the noninteracting operator @xmath34 corresponds to the vacuum @xmath59 .",
    "since the creation of particles is catalytic , then if we start from the vacuum state , we will obtain a trivial steady vector namely @xmath60 . to overcome this problem ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce a modification on the rules of the models .",
    "the necessity of introducing a small modification on systems with absorging states in order to get nontrivial steady states has been considered previously by tom and de oliveira @xcite and by de oliveira @xcite .",
    "the modification we have made consists in introducing a spontaneous creation of particles in two specified adjacent sites for the pccp and apccp .",
    "the chosen sites are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , so that the rates @xmath63 and @xmath64 are changed to @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is supposed to be a small parameter .",
    "this modification leads to the following expression to the operator @xmath34 @xmath68 the steady state @xmath53 of @xmath32 is not the vacuum state anymore .",
    "now , it is given by @xmath69 where all sites before and after the symbol `` . ''",
    "are empty .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first , only the last term in @xmath53 will give nonzero contributions to the expansion so that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , will be of the order @xmath72 .",
    "second , although the change in @xmath34 will cause a change in @xmath73 , only the terms of zero order in the expansion in @xmath67 , given by the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) , will be necessary since the corrections in @xmath73 will contribute to terms of order larger than @xmath72 .",
    "for instance , the two first vectors , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , for the pccp are given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 the translational invariance of the system is assumed .",
    "for the tccp , the rates @xmath78 , @xmath79 are modified similarly and an analogous initial vector @xmath53 is obtained . however , the vectors @xmath70 , @xmath71 , will be of the order @xmath80 .",
    "the series expansions for the probability vector @xmath81 obtained here are equivalent to the laplace transform @xmath82 of the time dependent vector probability @xmath28 in the subcritical regime . if we assume that @xmath82 can be expanded in powers of @xmath3 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 for the pccp and apccp and @xmath87 for the tccp .",
    "the two first vectors for the pccp is given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "in the limit @xmath91 , eq . ( [ laplace1 ] ) becomes identical ( by a factor @xmath92 ) to the eq .",
    "( [ vector1 ] ) , that is @xmath93 .",
    "the next orders of the expansion will also produce vectors that follows a similar relationship , namely @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the steady - state vector @xmath95 has a close relationship with the laplace transform @xmath82 of the time dependent vector probability @xmath28 in the subcritical regime .",
    ".coefficients for the series expansion for total number of particles @xmath5 corresponding to the pccp , apccp , and tccp [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      versus the time @xmath96 for some values of @xmath3 for the apccp . from top to bottom @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . ]",
    "as a check of the accuracy of the results obtained here , we have performed spreading simulations for the apccp , since its critical point is unknown in the literature .",
    "following grassberger and de la torre @xcite , we started from a initial configuration close to the absorbing state with only two adjacent particles , we can study the time evolution the survival probablility @xmath102 , the mean number of particles @xmath103 , and the mean - square distance of the particles from the origin @xmath104 . at the critical point , these quantities are governed by power - laws whose their related critical exponents are named @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "off - critical point , we expect deviations from the power - law behavior . in the fig .",
    "[ apccpnp ] , we plotted the quantity @xmath103 versus the time @xmath96 for some values of @xmath3 .",
    "analogous analysis can be done for determing the exponents @xmath105 and @xmath107 . at the critical value @xmath108 , our data for the three quantities @xmath103 , @xmath109 , and @xmath104 follow indeed a power law behavior , whose critical exponents are consistent with those of the dp universality class .",
    "we have derived subcritical series expansions for studying the critical behavior of three nonequilibrium systems characterized by multiple - creation of particles . although series expansion have been applied sucessfully for the contact process and similar models @xcite , this is the first time that these systems , with multi - reaction rules , has been treated by means of a technique other than numerical simulations . with exception of the tccp ,",
    "whose value of @xmath110 are in the same level of precision of numerical simulation estimates , the subcritical series expansion give us the best estimates for the critical point of the models considered here .",
    "the critical exponents are consistent with those related to models beloging in the dp universality class .",
    "we remark finally that the present approach may be very useful to determine the critical behavior and universality classes for other nonequilibrium systems .",
