    "the last few years haven seen the establishment of the lyman-@xmath0  forest as one of the major observational tools to probe the matter power spectrum .",
    "measurements of the matter power from the lyman-@xmath0  forest data extend to smaller scales and probe a complementary redshift range than those using the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galaxy surveys or weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0  forest is thus ideally suited to constrain cosmological parameters which affect the power spectrum on small scales like the neutrino mass and the mass of dark matter ( dm ) particles ( seljak et al .",

    "a consistent picture emerges suggesting that the fluctuation amplitude of the matter power spectrum @xmath1 is rather high , that the spectral index of primordial density fluctuations is consistent with the value @xmath9 and that there is no evidence for a running of the spectral index , significant neutrino mass or a deviation from a cold dark matter spectrum at small scales ( croft et al .",

    "major uncertainties are thereby the assumed effective optical depth and thermal history of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the numerical limitations in obtaining accurate theoretical predictions for the flux power spectrum for a large parameter space ( see vhs and m04a for a detailed discussion ) .",

    "viel et al . found @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath8 ) and no evidence for a ( large ) running spectral index when they combined the lyman-@xmath0  forest data with the wmap data .",
    "similar results have have been obtained subsequently by the sdss collaboration from a much larger sample of 3035 low - resolution low s / n spectra with significantly wider reshift coverage ( m04b ; seljak et al .",
    "these findings corrected earlier claims of spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who used the data of c02 combined with cmb and galaxy survey data to argue for a significant tilt away from the canonical harrison - zeldovich @xmath9 spectrum and possibly also for a running of the spectral index ( see seljak et al .",

    "large samples of qso absorption spectra offer the opportunity to obtain the flux power spectrum for a wide range of redshifts with an accuracy at the percent level . despite the generally good agreement between different groups achieved in the last couple of years",
    "there are , however , still major open issues of what and how large the uncertainties in the cosmological and astrophysical parameters inferred from the flux power spectrum are ( see vhs and m04b for discussions with different views ) .",
    "it will be important to resolve these issues if further progress is to be made .",
    "the two data sets used by vhs and m04b and their theoretical modelling were very different . the sdss qso data set analysed by m04a consists of @xmath12 qso spectra at low resolution ( @xmath13 ) and low s / n ( @xmath14 per pixel ) spanning a wide range of redshifts , while the luqas and the c02 samples contain mainly high resolution ( @xmath15 ) , high signal - to - noise ( @xmath16 per pixel ) qso spectra with median redshifts of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the analysis methods to infer cosmological and astrophysical parameters were also very different . m04b modelled the flux power spectrum using a large number of hpm simulations ( gnedin & hui 1998 ; viel , haehnelt & springel 2005 ) exploring a large multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "viel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) improved instead the effective bias method developed by c02 .",
    "they used a grid of full hydrodynamical simulations run with the tree - sph code ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ; springel 2005 ) to invert the non - linear relation between flux and matter power spectrum .",
    "both methods have their own set of problems .",
    "m04b had to use the approximate hpm method which they could only calibrate on a small number of hydro simulations of small box size ( see viel , haehnelt & springel ( 2005 ) for a discussion of the accuracy of hpm simulations ) .",
    "m04b further had to compromise on box size and even time - stepping in order to explore a large parameter space .",
    "this lead to large number of uncertain corrections which added to another large set of corrections necessary because of the rather low resolution and s / n of their data .",
    "the method used by vhs on the other hand requires differentiating the 1d flux power spectrum to obtain the `` 3d '' flux power spectrum , which introduces rather large errors .",
    "this makes the assessment of statistical errors somewhat difficult .",
    "we refer to zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark ( 2001 ) ; gnedin & hamilton ( 2002 ) ; zaldarriaga , scoccimarro & hui ( 2003 ) and seljak , mcdonald & makarov ( 2003 ) for a further critical assessments of the use of the effective bias method to infer cosmological parameters .",
    "vhs concluded that the best they can do was to give an estimate of the many systematic uncertainties involved and to combine these in a conservative way in the final result .",
    "however , for attemtps to take advantage of the full redshift coverage and smaller errors of the observed sdds flux power spectrum the effective bias stops being useful .",
    "further motivated by the differences in the data and in the theoretical modelling performed by the two groups , we will analyse here the sdss flux power spectrum with high resolution , large box - size full hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "ideally , one would like to be able to repeat the analysis made by the sdss collaboration by using a very fine grid of full hydrodynamical simulations in order to be able to sample the multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "however , at present , this approach is not feasible since hydrodynamical simulations are very time consuming .",
    "we therefore decided to concentrate most of the analysis on a small region of the parameter space , around the best - fit models obtained by the two groups .",
    "we thereby use a taylor expansion to approximate the flux power spectrum around a best - guess model .",
    "this approximation should be reasonably accurate for little displacements in parameter space .",
    "we have checked the validity of the approximation for a few models .",
    "however , we caution the reader that the final error bars on recovered astrophysical and cosmological parameters is likely to be somewhat underestimated due to unaccounted errors of this approximation .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ data ]",
    "we briefly describe the sdss data set , while the hydrodynamical simulations are discussed in section [ hydro ] .",
    "section [ results ] describes the technical details of our modelling of the flux power spectrum and the reader more interested in the results may go straight to section [ chifitting ] where we discuss our findings for the cosmological and astrophysical parameters .",
    "section [ conclu ] contains a summary and an outline of possible ways of improving these measurements .",

    "the large number of spectra means , however , that the flux power spectrum on scales a factor of a few larger than the thermal cut - off can be measured with small statistical errors .",
    "m04a have re - analyzed the raw absorption spectra and have investigated the effect of noise , resolution of the spectrograph , sky subtraction , quasar continuum and associated metal absorption .",
    "m04a make corrections for these effects and give estimates of the errors for the most important of these corrections .",
    "the corrections are not small .",
    "the noise contribution to the flux power spectrum rises from 15 - 30 percent at the smallest wavenumbers to order unity at the largest wavenumbers and varies with redshift . the correction for uncorrelated metal absorption",
    "are generally a factor five to ten smaller than this .",
    "the correction for resolution varies from 1% at the smallest wavenumbers to a factor four at the largest wavenumbers .",
    "m04a also identified a correlated siiii feature in the absorption spectra for which they present an empirical fit to the effect on the flux power spectrum .",

    "this made it impossible to fully sample a large multi - dimensional parameter space with full hydro - simulations . with the rather modest numerical resources available to us we have thus decided to take the following approach .",
    "we have first run a range of simulations with cosmological parameters close to those inferred by vhs and m04b which allowed us to explore a wider range of thermal histories of the igm to better understand the resulting uncertainties .",
    "we have then fitted the simulated flux power spectra to the sdss flux power spectrum as described in section [ chifitting ] . based on this and our previous studies in vhs",

    "there is a wide range of systematic uncertainties in the analysis of the flux power spectrum .",
    "the origins of these uncertainties fall broadly into five categories :    * deficiencies of the data which have to be corrected ; * uncertainty of the effective optical depth ; * uncertainty of the thermal state of the igm ; * lack of ability to make accurate predictions of the flux power spectrum for a large parameter space ; * lack of ability to model other physical processes which potentially affect the flux power spectrum .",

    "note that m04a also subtracted a contribution of uncorrelated associated metal absorption which they estimated redward of the lyman-@xmath0  emission line .",
    "the effect of continuum fitting errors on the flux power spectrum is a further uncertainty which is discussed in k04 , m04a and tytler et al .",
    "continuum fitting errors are difficult to quantify and we again follow m04b in not attempting to model them .      as discussed in vhs and seljak et al .",
    "( 2003 ) the poorly known effective optical depth results in major uncertainties in any analysis of the lyman-@xmath0  forest flux power spectrum .",
    "the effective optical depth is to a large extent degenerate with the amplitude of the matter power spectrum .",
    "as shown in m04b the @xmath82dependence of changes in the flux power spectrum due to varying effective optical depth and amplitude of the matter power spectrum are , however , somewhat different .",
    "this allows  at least in principle  to break this degeneracy .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "when modelling the effective optical depth we will investigate two cases .",
    "we will either let the effective optical depth vary independently in the different redshift bins or we will parameterize the evolution of the effective optical depth as a power law in redshift .      in order to explore in more detail the uncertainties due to thermal effects on the flux power spectrum we have run simulations with a wide range of thermal histories ( table 1 ) .",
    "note that this is different from vhs where we have only performed a - posteriori rescalings of the temperature - density relation to investigate thermal effects .",
    "we have calculated the value @xmath93 as the median temperature of gas with logarithmic overdensity values between -0.1 and 0.1 . the value of @xmath94 we determined from the slope of the temperature - density relation for gas at mean density and 1.1 times the mean density .",

    "decreasing @xmath94 by @xmath106 produces an increase in the flux power by 7.5 % ( 2.5 % ) , but we note that for @xmath107 s / km the differences increase strongly .    we will later model the evolution of the thermal state of the igm with redshift as broken power laws for temperature and slope of the temperature - density relation .      modelling the flux power spectrum accurately is numerically challenging and checks for convergence are important",
    "we have chosen to use here full hydro - simulations performed with described in section [ hydro ] . in vhs",
    "we found that simulations with a box size 60 @xmath108 mpc and with @xmath109 particles ( 60,400 ) are the best compromise for the analysis of the luqas sample .",
    "the lower resolution sdss power spectrum is not affected on large scale in the same way by continuum fitting errors as the high - resolution spectra which we used in vhs and for which continuum fitting errors appear to increase the flux power significantly at and above the scale corresponding to one echelle order ( kim et al .",

    "we have first checked how well the largest scales probed by sdss are sampled by our fiducial ( 60,400 ) simulations . in vhs",
    "this was not an issue since the first data point used in the analysis was at @xmath111 s / km , which was well sampled by the ( 60,400 ) simulations .",

    "the error of the aproximation is less than 3.5% which should be compared to the difference to the best - guess model which is @xmath14% .",

    "the error for the model with the different @xmath93 parameter is @xmath158% . by comparing with figure 3",
    "we find that for @xmath152 displacements in the parameters @xmath3,@xmath1,@xmath159 and @xmath93 the error of the taylor series approximation is generally less than 30% of the difference between the models .",
    "this is not perfect but should be acceptable considering the expense of full - hydrodynamical simulations and the size of the parameter space .",
    "we have modified the code cosmomc ( lewis & bridle 2002 ) to run monte carlo markov chains for our set of parameters . after settling on a best guess model",

    "the contours have been obtained by marginalizing over the rest of the parameters .",
    "we note that the best fit models prefer somewhat larger values of the spectral index and higher temperatures than those of our best guess model .",
    "the 2d contour plot of @xmath172 vs @xmath169 , suggests that in order to reconcile this measurement with a colder igm one would need an unplausibly steep temperature density relation with @xmath173 .",

    "for the time being we would advice the conservative reader to double the formal errors quoted here .",
    "this will bring the error estimates to about the same size as the also conservative estimates for the errors of the fluctuation amplitude from the lyman-@xmath0  forest data alone in the analysis of vhs .",
    "the actual errors lie probably somewhere in between .",
    "we have compared the flux power spectra calculated from a suite of full large box - size high resolution ( @xmath264 mpc , @xmath109 particles ) hydrodynamical simulations with the sdss flux power spectrum as published by mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . we have identified a best - guess model which provides a good fit to the data .",
    "we have used a taylor expansion to first order to calculate flux power spectra in a multi - dimensional space of parameters describing the matter power spectrum and the thermal history of the igm with values close to those of our best - guess model .",
    "we have investigated the combined effect of cosmological and astrophysical parameters on the flux power spectrum with an adapted version of the markov - chain code cosmomc .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* the flux power spectrum calculated directly from the simulation of a @xmath265cdm model ( @xmath63 , @xmath266 , @xmath65 and @xmath66,@xmath267 ) with a temperature density relation described by @xmath268 and @xmath269 gives an acceptable fit to the sdss flux power spectrum in the redshift range @xmath270 ( @xmath271 for 88 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the fit can easily be further improved by small changes in the cosmological and astrophysical parameters .",
    "* at higher redshift the deviations from the observed flux power spectrum become significantly larger ( @xmath272 for 12 additional data points at @xmath26 ) suggesting either some problem with the data or a physical effect that changes rapidly with redshift .",
    "* we confirm the claim by mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the degeneracy of the dependence of the flux power spectrum on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum and the effective optical depth can be broken for the published sdss flux power spectrum",
    ". it will be interesting to see if the same is true for the independent analysis of the sdss data to be released soon .",
    "* the sdss power spectrum alone can constrain the amplitude of the matter power spectrum , the matter density and the power - law index of primordial density fluctuation to within @xmath273 .",
    "the thermal state of the igm is however , poorly constrained and the sdss power spectrum formally prefers models with unplausible values of the parameters describing the thermal state .",
    "the dependence of the flux power spectrum on the assumed hubble constant is also very weak and the hubble constant is not well constrained .",
    "the exact values for the other cosmological parameters depend somewhat on the assumed prior for the thermal state and the details of the correction which have been applied to the data . * with a prior on the thermal history and the hubble constant motivated by the observations by schaye et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we obtain the following best - fitting values for the cosmological parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 error bars ) , and the effective optical depth is well described by the following power - law relation : @xmath244^{3.22\\pm0.24}$ ] .",
    "the errors were obtained by marginalizing over a set of 22 parameters describing the matter distribution , thermal history of the universe , the effective optical depth and errors to various corrections to the data .",
    "the values for @xmath60 and @xmath3 are consistent with those found by m04a for the same data set with different simulations .",
    "they are also consistent with the results of other recent studies of lyman-@xmath0  forest data .",
    "the inferred optical depth is in good agreement with that measured directly from continuum - fitted high - quality absorption spectra .",
    "the simulations were run on the cosmos ( sgi altix 3700 ) supercomputer at the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics in cambridge .",
