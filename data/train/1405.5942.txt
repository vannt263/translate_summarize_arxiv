    "the study of the game of nim is fundamental to the field of combinatorial game theory .",
    "nim is known as an _ impartial combinatorial game _ , a game in which each player has the same moves available at each point in the game and has a complete amount of information about the game and the potential moves .",
    "in addition , there is no randomness in the game ( such as rolling dice )",
    ".    originally introduced by charles bouton in 1901 @xcite , nim has played a role in many combinatorial games .",
    "the relationship between nim and other impartial combinatorial games can be described with the sprague - grundy theorem @xcite , which states that all impartial games are equivalent to a nim heap .",
    "although the game of nim has been studied extensively @xcite , in this paper , we invent new sequences related to enumeration of the p - positions of nim .    in section  [ sec : gamenim ] we introduce the game of nim as well as bouton s general formula for p - positions . in section",
    "[ sec : sequences ] we define the sequences we want to count and provide examples for the games with one and two piles .",
    "one set of sequences is indexed by the maximum number of counters in a p - position and the other by the total number of counters .",
    "we continue with calculating formulae for the sequences indexed by the maximum number of counters in section  [ sec : max ] .",
    "we calculate the three - piles case in section  [ sec : three ] and the four - piles case in section  [ sec : four ] .",
    "it can be noted that the calculation method is different for an odd and an even number of piles .",
    "but these sections provide enough background for a general formula in section  [ sec : many ] .",
    "then we turn our attention to the sequences indexed by the total number of counters in section  [ sec : total ] .",
    "we start with calculated the three - piles case in section  [ sec : threetotal ] and discover that this sequence describes an evolution of a particular cellular automaton .",
    "we explain in section  [ sec : evolution ] how nim can be viewed as an automaton .",
    "we extend the definitions to allow any impartial combinatorial game to be viewed as an automaton in section  [ sec : evolany ] . in section  [ sec : uw ] we define the ulam - warburton automaton , three branches of which correspond to nim with three piles . we proceed to enumerating four piles in section  [ sec : fourtotal ] and arbitrarily many piles in section  [ sec : manytotal ] .",
    "in nim , there are @xmath0 piles of counters , with @xmath1 counters in each pile .",
    "two players alternate turns by taking some or all of the counters in a single pile .",
    "the player who takes the last counter ( or equivalently , makes the last move ) wins .",
    "we may denote the state or position of a game with the ordered tuple @xmath2 .",
    "we begin by introducing some general definitions in game theory . assuming that both players use an optimal strategy , there are two types of positions in a game such as nim :    a _ p - position _ is a position in which the previous player will win ( the one who just moved ) .",
    "n - position _ is a position in which the next player will win ( the one about to move ) .",
    "we denote the set of p - positions as @xmath3 , and the set of n - positions as @xmath4 .",
    "thus , any move from a p - position must be an n - position , and conversely , every n - position has at least one move that results in a p - position .",
    "this motivates the following theorem @xcite :    [ thm : general ] suppose that the positions of a finite impartial game can be partitioned into disjoint sets @xmath5 and @xmath6 with the properties :    1 .",
    "every move of a position in @xmath5 is to a position in @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   every position in @xmath6 has at least one move to a position in @xmath5 .",
    "3 .   the terminal positions are in @xmath5",
    ".    then @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    with respect to nim , by definition , the position @xmath9 will be a ( terminal ) p - position .",
    "note that the general winning strategy is to move to a p - position .    to explicitly give a formula for p - positions , we need the following definition :    the _ nim - sum _ of two non - negative integers @xmath10 is their bit - wise xor : @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 and @xmath13 in binary with leading zeroes as necessary , where @xmath14 is the maximum number of digits in the binary representation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "then the nim - sum of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the nim - sum is clearly associative and commutative , and @xmath20 is the identity element .",
    "further , @xmath21 implies @xmath22 .",
    "we can extend the concept of nim - sum to a position @xmath23 : it is simply @xmath24 .",
    "the following theorem ( see @xcite ) describes the set of p - positions in nim .",
    "[ thm : nim ] @xmath3 is the set of positions in the game of nim with nim - sum @xmath20 , and @xmath4 is the complement .    from here , we can show that the last pile in a p - position is a function of the previous @xmath25 piles .",
    "[ thm : ppos ] a position @xmath26 is a p - position if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "we would like to enumerate p - positions in the game of nim .",
    "we assume that the number of piles , @xmath0 , is fixed , which means that piles of zero are allowed .",
    "there are two natural ways to enumerate these p - positions .    in the first set of sequences , we want to count the number of p - positions where the number of counters in each pile is bounded by some number @xmath28 .",
    "we call these sequences _ indexed - by - maximum_.    * @xmath29 is the number of p - positions in the game of nim with @xmath0 piles such that each pile has no more than @xmath28 counters . * @xmath30 is the number of p - positions in the game of nim with @xmath0 piles such that the largest pile has exactly @xmath28 counters .    note that @xmath30 is the sequence of first differences of @xmath29 , and @xmath29 is the sequence of partial sums of @xmath30 .    another natural way to enumerate p - positions is to bound the total number of counters in all the piles . note that the total number of counters in p - positions is even .",
    "we call these sequences _ indexed - by - total_.    * @xmath31 is the number of p - positions in the game of nim with @xmath0 piles such that the total number of counters is no more than @xmath32 . * @xmath33 is the number of p - positions in the game of nim with @xmath0 piles such that the total number of counters is exactly @xmath32 .    once again ,",
    "note that @xmath33 is the sequence of first differences of @xmath31 , and @xmath31 is the sequence of partial sums of @xmath33 .    in our proofs",
    ", we loosely use the term `` pile '' to refer to the number of counters in the pile .",
    "let us denote the total number of counters in a p - position @xmath34 as @xmath35 ; that is , @xmath36 .",
    "sequences @xmath29 and @xmath31 can bound each other due to the following lemma :    [ thm : numberbound ] @xmath37 .",
    "the upper bound is obvious . to prove the lower bound ,",
    "consider the place values of the ones in the binary representation of @xmath38 . by theorem  [ thm : nim ] , the nim - sum is @xmath20 , and the only way for this to occur is if the other piles collectively have ones in each of those place values .",
    "thus , the lower bound then follows immediately since the sum of the numbers other than @xmath38 is at least @xmath38 .",
    "[ thm : bounds ] @xmath39 .",
    "the sequence @xmath31 enumerates p - positions with no more than @xmath32 counters .",
    "these positions can not have more than @xmath28 counters in any pile by lemma  [ thm : numberbound ] , so they all are included in the enumeration corresponding to @xmath29 .",
    "further , every position with the maximum pile of no more than @xmath40 must have a sum of less than @xmath32 .",
    "thus , p - positions that are counted by @xmath41 are all included in the count of @xmath31 .    in sections below",

    ", this generates the following corollary ,    @xmath52      if there is only one pile , there is only one p - position : ( 0 ) .",

    "take the next power of 2 .",
    "if it corresponds to the same two piles continue forward , otherwise turn 90 degrees either left or right depending on the new pair and move @xmath159 steps .",
    "now we want to make an explicit bijection between cells in the automaton and p - positions . to start , we identify the p - position @xmath167 with the point @xmath168 and west direction , the p - position @xmath169 with the point @xmath170 and east direction , and the p - position @xmath171 with the point @xmath172 and north direction .",
    "now we define turns :    * left turn : changing direction from @xmath167 to @xmath171 , from @xmath171 to @xmath169 , and from @xmath169 to @xmath167 * right turn : changing direction from @xmath167 to @xmath169 , from @xmath169 to @xmath171 , and from @xmath171 to @xmath167 .    each cell in the automaton ( correspondingly , p - position ) has exactly one parent .",
    "the cell ( p - position ) is uniquely described by the path from the starting point ( terminal position ) .",
    "we showed the bijection between the paths which establishes the bijection between the cells and the p - positions .",
    "for example , consider the p - position @xmath173 , which can be decomposed into powers of 2 : @xmath174 .",
    "this means that the evolution happens in the following way .",
    "start with the p - position @xmath175 , then 8 generations are born in the direction @xmath171 until the p - position @xmath176 is reached .",
    "after that 4 generations are born in the direction @xmath169 until the p - position @xmath177 is reached .",
    "after that 2 generations are born in the direction @xmath171 reaching @xmath178 , then the child is born in the direction @xmath167 reaching the final destination @xmath173 .",
    "this corresponds to the following walk on the automaton : 8 steps to the right until the coordinates @xmath179 , turn right , 4 more steps reaching @xmath180 , turn left and make 2 more steps reaching @xmath181 , then turn left again and make one step to get to @xmath182 .",
    "it is more natural to place the nim evolution in 3d , but such a graph is more difficult to draw and to visualize ; see figure  [ fig : nimevol ] .",
    "let us move to four piles .",
    "the number of possible parents is 1 , 2 or 6 :    * 1 : if there is one pair of binary numbers with the same number of zeros at the end , * 2 : if there are two pairs of binary numbers such that the number of zeros at the end is the same within each pair and different for different pairs , * 6 : all four binary numbers have the same number of zeros at the end .    similarly , the number of possible children is 1 , 2 , or 6 .",

    "sequence @xmath183 can be described recursively :    @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 for @xmath187 , and @xmath188 for @xmath189    consider a p - position with total sum @xmath190 .",
    "it has exactly two odd piles .",
    "that means it can be achieved by doubling a p - position with total sum @xmath32 and adding two counters in any pair of piles .",
    "the latter can be done in 6 ways .",
