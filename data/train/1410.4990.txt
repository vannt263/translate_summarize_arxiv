    "although the superconductivity arises in the iron arsenide layers , the @xmath5 cation has a significant role in both tuning the superconducting @xmath10 in the doped materials @xcite and in defining the magnetism of the parent non - superconducting materials ( such as the spin - reorientations in ndfeaso @xcite and prfeaso @xcite ) .",

    "the observation of the same 2-@xmath3 magnetic structure across the series @xmath0o@xmath1fe@xmath1ose@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = la , ce , nd ) suggests that this ordering pattern is fairly robust with respect to chemical pressure ( the @xmath59 decrease in @xmath2 ionic radii from @xmath2 = la to @xmath2 = ce @xcite results in a @xmath59 decrease in unit cell volume @xcite , with a relatively larger contraction in the @xmath50 plane ) .",

    "the lack of any spin reorientation in ce@xmath1o@xmath1fe@xmath1ose@xmath1 may reflect the ising - like nature of the fe ordering , with the local anisotropy of fe directing moments oriented along fe  o(2 ) bonds and parallel to the expected ce easy axis .",
