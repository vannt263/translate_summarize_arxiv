    "there has been a steadily growing number of rotation - powered pulsars with emission detected at high energies , following the success of the compton gamma - ray observatory ( thompson 2001 ) and detections by rosat , asca , rxte and most recently by chandra and xmm ( becker & aschenbach 2002 ) . with the number of pulsars having detected emission above 1 kev now approaching several dozen",
    ", high - energy radiation seems to be a common feature .",
    "although the theory of acceleration and high - energy emission in pulsars has been studied for over twenty - five years , the origin of the pulsed non - thermal emission is a question that remains unsettled .",
    "the observations to date have not been able to clearly distinguish between an emission site at the magnetic poles ( daugherty & harding 1996 , hereafter dh96 ) and emission from the outer magnetospheric gaps ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 , hirotani & shibata 2001 ) .",
    "complicating the problem is the fact that both models have some unresolved difficulties . in the case of polar cap ( pc )",
    "models , while the energetics and pair - cascade spectrum have had success in reproducing the observations , the predicted beam size of radiation emitted near the neutron star ( ns ) surface is too small to produce the wide pulse profiles that are observed .",
    "however , arons ( 1983 , hereafter a83 ) first noted the possibility of a high - altitude acceleration region or  slot gap \" ( sg ) near the pc rim , based on the finding of arons & scharlemann ( 1979 , hereafter as79 ) that the pair formation front ( pff ) , above which the accelerating field is screened , occurs at increasingly higher altitude as the magnetic colatitude approaches the last open field line where the electric field vanishes .",
    "the sg is a characteristic feature that is unavoidable in any pc space - charge limited flow model . in the last few years",
    ", a self - consistent model of pc acceleration has been developed , which includes effects of general relativity ( harding & muslimov 1998 , hereafter hm98 ) and screening by pairs ( harding & muslimov 2001 , hereafter hm01 ; harding & muslimov 2002 , hereafter hm02 ) .",
    "hm98 concentrated on acceleration in the interior regions of the pc , but their calculation confirmed that a sg also forms near the pc rim in the presence of inertial frame dragging .",
    "interestingly , since the magnitude , and longitudinal and radial dependences of the accelerating electric field used in hm98 are different from those in the model of as79 , in the calculation of hm98 the pff is curving up more abruptly to form the inner boundary of a much narrower sg .",
    "the present paper is motivated by the fact that , despite the attractive possibility of primary acceleration within the sg region of a pulsar inner magnetosphere ( as79 ) , the electrodynamics and energetics of the sg acceleration remain to a large extent unexplored beyond the original model of as79 .",
    "what we know about sg acceleration is mostly based on a classical model of as79 and further developments by a83 and arons ( 1996 , hereafter a96 ) , and it has never been investigated in any other electrodynamic model thus far . however , we believe that within the general - relativistic model of space - charge limited flow from the pulsar pc ( muslimov & tsygan , 1992 , hereafter mt92 ) the acceleration properties within the sg will significantly differ from those implied by the sg originally proposed by as79 . the sg model of as79 and a83 produced effective acceleration only for large inclination angles and only on  favorably curved \" field lines , i.e. those field lines curving toward the rotation axis .",
    "the frame - dragging acceleration dominates at most pulsar periods at small inclination angles , and operates over the entire pc ( i.e. it is not restricted to favorably curved field lines ) . besides this simple update of the underlying electrodynamic model ,",
    "we incorporate an additional effect of screening of the electric field within the pc slot , a narrow space between the last open field lines and lines confining the pair plasma column generated at relatively low altitudes above the pc surface .",
    "this enhanced screening is caused by taking into account a second conducting boundary formed by the pair plasma column very near the last open field line .",
    "the @xmath2 within the sg is greatly reduced by the proximity of two conducting boundaries and is well - known from the electrodynamics in narrow tubes and cones with conducting surfaces ( landau & lifshitz 1984 ) .",
    "ironically , this effect of screening by two closely spaced conducting boundaries was overlooked in original calculations of the sg acceleration , in which only the conducting boundary at the last open field line was taken into account . to estimate the field in the sg ,",
    "a83 simply applied the solution for the accelerating electric field in the absence of the pair plasma , assuming screening only from the last open field line boundary .    the major advantage of acceleration within the sg is the possibility of establishing the curvature radiation ( cr ) pff and generation of @xmath3ray emission at high altitudes",
    "the need to locate the generation of pair cascades and @xmath4-ray emission at high altitude above the pc was demonstrated by daugherty & harding ( 1996 , hereafter dh96 ) , and later also by rudak et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who numerically modeled the pair formation , high - energy radiation spectra and light curves at different altitudes in pulsars .",
    "they found that the shape of the cascade spectrum and high - energy cutoff , due to magnetic pair creation , for the vela pulsar best matches the observed spectrum for emission at altitudes around 1 - 2 stellar radii above the surface .",
    "furthermore , the wide @xmath4-ray profiles observed can be produced in pc models only if the emission beam opening angle is comparable to the inclination angle .",
    "high altitude emission along flaring field lines would enable larger high energy beams .",
    "dh96 approached the problem by trying to reproduce the observed spectra and light curves of the vela pulsar by assuming a simple parameterized model of the accelerating electric field .",
    "however , the physical origin of that accelerating field as well as possible regimes of acceleration and energetics for different pulsar spin periods and magnetic fields could not be addressed in that approach .",
    "also the details of such modeling , such as the pair - formation altitudes , hardness of the spectrum , and widths of the high - energy pulses , will also depend on the regime of acceleration of primaries within the sg . in his study of high - energy emission from the sg ,",
    "a96 came to the conclusion that the sg energetics , as determined by a potential which did not include the frame - dragging effect , is not enough to account for the observed @xmath3ray luminosities and spectra of the crab and vela pulsars .",
    "furthermore , he investigated only the cr from the primary particles accelerating in the sg which results in a spectrum that does not match the softer observed spectra of @xmath4-ray pulsars . in this paper , we additionally consider the emission from the high - altitude pair cascades above the pff that bounds the inner edge of the sg .",
    "we derive the general relativistic accelerating electric field in the case of the sg to include the effect of screening caused by the slot geometry , and present our calculations of pair cascades at high altitudes ( at a few stellar radii above the surface ) , @xmath3 ray spectra , and @xmath3 ray light curves .",
    "we provide simple expressions for the @xmath0-ray and heating luminosities , and discuss possible constraints on the crab pulsar viewing angles and obliquities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 we discuss the electrodynamics within the sg regions of pulsars .",
    "we present the electric potential drop in  2.1 , calculate the energetics of primaries in  2.2 , estimate the characteristic gap thickness in  2.3 , and derive @xmath3ray luminosities per solid angle emitted by the sgs as well as heating luminosities in  2.4 . in ",
    "3 we discuss the main results of our numerical cascade simulations . finally , in  4 we discuss our main results and draw our principal conclusions .",
    "the sg model for the emission region of a pulsar was originally proposed by as79 , who were the first to observe that in a space - charge limited flow the process of pair formation may significantly vary across the pc . for example , in their electrodynamic model , the pair formation surface tends to curve up and become asymptotically tangent to the field lines near the boundary of the polar tube in its half with the so - called  favorably curved \" field lines .",
    "this occurs simply because the acceleration of electrons in this region is not sufficient to produce pairs at low altitude , leaving a sg around the column of pair plasma .",
    "this model was described in detail by a83 , and also overviewed by arons ( 1981 ) and a96 .",
    "the very concept of sg acceleration , and its potential impact on pair production , radio and high - energy emission from pulsars , was a significant finding .",
    "however , the original sg treatment failed to produce a viable model of pulsar high - energy emission .",
    "one reason is that the calculation of electron acceleration within the sg was inconsistent with the acceleration and pair formation in rest of polar flux tube region . in this paper",
    "we discuss and calculate the effect that we believe makes the regime of sg acceleration very feasible and attractive .",
    "figure 1 schematically illustrates the geometry of the open field lines at the pc .",
    "the extended sg region is squeezed between the pair plasma column and closed magnetospheric region filled with plasma .",
    "the ring - like structure on the top indicates the elevated pair formation site .",
    "we shall also introduce the sg half - width in the longitudinal direction scaled to the pc surface , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the pc radius . in a small - angle approximation ( which is perfect for the sg case ) the goldreich - julian ( gj ) charge density and the charge density of primary electrons read _ _ gj = - b_0 f ( ) [ rhogj ] and = - b_0 f ( ) , [ rho ] respectively .",

    "note that formula ( [ dzeta1 ] ) does not take into account the effect of screening near the sg and is based therefore on a somewhat underestimated value of @xmath73 which results in the underestimation of the sg width .",

    "@xmath134 is the minimum efficiency of converting spin - down luminosity into the luminosity of the primary beam needed for pair formation ( see hm02 and hmz02 for details ) . according to our calculation performed in hm02 the value of parameter @xmath135 ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 . for the parameters of a canonical ns and for @xmath136 ,",
    "we get > ~2.5 p -14 , as the required condition for sgs to form .    note also that the relationship between the pulsar death line and the regime of sg acceleration may be justified only for the cr - produced pair front .",
    "even though the sgs may still be formed in the case of the ics pair production above the bulk of the pc , the density of pair plasma may not be sufficient to guarantee the efficiency of the geometrical screening . in this case",
    "the effective parameter @xmath101 may significantly differ from that calculated in this paper , including the case where it approaches 1 ( no geometrical screening within the sg ) .",
    "our previous calculation of the ics pffs indicates ( see e.g. hm01 , hm02 ) that this situation may well occur in some pulsars that are slightly below the death line ( e.g. in millisecond and relatively old pulsars ) . in this paper",
    "we do not intend to discuss these non - ideal sgs .",
    "before we discuss our numerical simulation it is worth mentioning that there is a long history associated with the  prototype \" of a sg model , the pure geometrical model of pulsar emission known as the hollow cone model . by analyzing the smooth variation of the direction of linear polarization within the radio pulsar pulse window radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) and radhakrishnan ( 1969 ) realized that these observations suggested that pulsars must be magnetized nss which produced relativistic particles from near the magnetic pcs .",
    "komesaroff ( 1970 ) showed that if the radio emission is due to cr then the pulsar beam must be a hollow cone .",
    "the double pulses observed in some pulsars , the pulse width , polarization , as well as the spectrum of pulses found a natural explanation within this model .    in order to explore the characteristics of high - energy emission produced by particles accelerated in the sg ,",
    "we have carried out monte carlo simulations of the pair cascades initiated by primary electrons accelerated by the @xmath2 in the gap .",
    "this calculation is very similar to the pair cascade simulation described by dh96 . in that paper ,",
    "primary electrons were accelerated above a pulsar pc by a simple model @xmath2 described by starting and terminating altitudes above the ns surface , a constant term and a linear term .",
    "these parameters were adjusted to produce both a sufficient final lorentz factor of the primary electrons and a wide enough gamma - ray beam geometry to explain the egret spectrum and pulse profile of the vela pulsar .",
    "dh96 found that a @xmath2 starting altitude of 2 stellar radii was required , but no physical justification was provided to support this value .",
    "dh96 also artificially enhanced the primary particle flux at the pc rim in order to produce the hollow emission cone , narrow pulses and low level of bridge emission necessary to model the vela profile .",
    "in the present study , we use the sg @xmath137 derived from the potential in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) . the acceleration rate as a function of distance is = ee _ 54  [ 1 - 38(1 + 7 ) ]  r_6 ^ 2  b_12^ ( ^4 + 14_0 ^ -1/2_pc ) ( 1-_^2 ) , [ epar ] where @xmath138 is defined right after eq .",
    "( [ phi_last ] ) . in this formula , for the sake of illustration , we pull out the general - relativistic correction from the second term to get its simple explicit @xmath49-dependence .",
    "even though in most cases the second term in the above equation is less than the first one , in our numerical calculations we use the exact formula for @xmath133 based on expression ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "the first term in parentheses is the contribution to acceleration from the inertial frame - dragging effect , where @xmath129 is the general relativistic parameter that depends on the ns compactness .",
    "the second term is the contribution from the field - line curvature , similar to the accelerating field of as79 .",
    "factors of order one have been omitted from this term in order to simplify the expression in the potential of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) . note that the sg acceleration rate given above is only mildly dependent on b and p. we assume that primary electrons begin their acceleration at the ns surface on a central field line of the sg , @xmath139 .",
    "we follow the electrons as they gain energy and follow their cr photons through the local magnetic field , accumulating the probability for creating an electron - positron pair .",
    "if the cr photons pair produce , the synchrotron emission of the created pair is simulated and the synchrotron radiation photons are followed in the same way to determine if they pair produce or escape .",
    "details of the cascade simulation may be found in dh96 and harding et al .",
    "we ignore inverse compton emission of the primaries and pairs and photon splitting of the cr photons .    to illustrate the features of the sg acceleration and cascades , we use the period ( @xmath140 ) and surface magnetic field ( @xmath141 ) of the crab pulsar for the case @xmath142 in eq .",
    "( [ epar ] ) . a stellar radius of 16 km is assumed .",
    "although the sg is a region devoid of pair plasma near the surface , full pair cascades can develop above the pffs that form at high altitudes along field lines near the pc rim .",
    "in contrast to the pair cascades that form in the core of the pc and terminate within a stellar radius of the ns surface , the pair cascades from particles accelerated in the sg develop over a larger distance and the screening of the electric field by the pairs thus requires a much larger distance .",
    "the primary electrons reach lorentz factors of @xmath143 in the sg before becoming radiation - reaction limited . however , the pair cascades begin at lower lorentz factors but the pair multiplicity builds up more slowly in comparison to pair cascades in the pc core ( see hm01 ) , so that the screening distance in the sg is relatively large and can be one or two stellar radii .",
    "we find that the pair cascade starts at an altitude of 0.5 - 1.0 stellar radii and continues up to 3 - 4 radii .",
    "since the bulk of the escaping high - energy photons are produced between 2 and 4 ns radii , the opening angle of the high - energy beam is much larger ( about 20 degrees for the crab period ) than for near - surface pc emission .",
    "figure 4 shows plots of the distribution on the sky of escaping cascade radiation above 100 kev as a function of phase , @xmath144 , and viewing angle with respect to the rotation axis , @xmath145 , for different assumed values of the inclination .",
    "for relatively small inclination angles that are comparable to the high- energy beam opening angle , emission can be seen over a large range of observer angles .",
    "as the inclination angle decreases , the hollow cone pattern becomes smaller and emission is visible over a smaller range of viewing angles . also at smaller inclination angles ,",
    "the emission hollow cone is complete because particle acceleration takes place at all phase angles around the magnetic pole .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the frame dragging term in the potential is independent of @xmath146 . at larger inclination angles ,",
    "our results show that the emission occurs over only part of the hollow cone .",
    "this is due to the @xmath147 dependence of the second term in the potential due to the  favorably curved \" field line acceleration that was the only source of accelerated particle in arons potential .",
    "at large inclination angles this part of the potential dominates as the frame dragging term is declining .",
    "because the favorably curved field lines from the two poles accelerate particles in opposite hemispheres , it is impossible for a single observer to view both poles of the pulsar in this model unless the high - energy beam opening angle is unrealistically large . instead ,",
    "at large viewing angles an observer would see a single narrow pulse .",
    "pulse profiles are formed by slicing across the phase plots in figure 4 at a constant viewing angle .",
    "examples of pulse profiles at several different inclination and viewing angles are shown in figure 5 .",
    "it is evident that widely spaced double - peaked profiles can result at relatively small inclination by slicing through the middle of the hollow cone .",
    "profiles with two pulses separated by more than 100 degrees , as are seen from the crab , vela and geminga , can be formed when the inclination angle is comparable to the beam opening angle ( about 20 degrees in this model for the crab ) .",
    "broad single pulses , as seen from psr b1509 - 58 , may be produced when the observer cuts along the edge of the cone .",
    "as the inclination angle increases , the maximum pulse separation decreases and the pulses themselves also become narrower .",
    "bridge emission as seen in vela and geminga high - energy profiles ( and in the crab profile around 1 mev ) is not produced in this calculation since we have modeled only cascades and emission from the sg , which produces a pure hollow cone beam . the core cascades will produce additional emission on field lines interior to the sg which will fill in the profile between the two pulses and produce bridge emission .",
    "emission from the full pc will be included in future modeling .",
    "emission can be seen in this model at all phases because primary electrons will continue to radiate curvature emission at higher altitudes ( all the way to the light cylinder ) above the termination of the pair cascade .",
    "this is the  off - beam \" emission ( harding & zhang 2001 ) that will be much softer than the on - beam emission from the cone .",
    "our cascade simulation includes aberration of the emitted photons as well as delay times between photons emitted at different altitudes . both of these effects become more important at the higher altitudes of the sg cascades and will produce asymmetries in the pulse profiles , especially for fast rotators .",
    "for example , aberration will produce a pair attenuation cutoff at lower energies for the pulse at the leading edge of the profile because the photon emitted at the leading edge attain large enough angles to the magnetic field to produce a pair in a shorter distance than photons emitted at the trailing edge .",
    "this effect was studied recently by dyks & rudak ( 2002 ) , who found that the observed disappearance of the first pulse in double - peaked profiles of the crab , vela and geminga pulsars could be produced if the photons were emitted at altitudes of several stellar radii above the surface .",
    "emission from the sg cascades will therefore naturally produce this effect .",
    "in this paper we revise the regime of electron acceleration within the sg regions above pulsar pcs . we have demonstrated that our treatment of acceleration within the sg allows us to address the longstanding issues of @xmath0-ray production at high altitudes in the pulsar inner magnetosphere , interpretation of multifrequency light curves of pulsars , and emission energetics .",
    "the fundamental differences between the sg model presented in this paper and the original sg model of as79 are    1 .",
    "our model takes into account the effect of electric field screening within the gap caused by the narrowness of the space between the gap equipotential surfaces ( effect of nearly parallel conducting boundaries on the accelerating electric field ) .",
    "2 .   our model incorporates the effect of general - relativistic frame dragging , which in most cases determines the pc acceleration properties . as a consequence of this ,",
    "our sg model is operable for all azimuthal angles around the pc and for all pulsar obliquities , whereas the classical arons - scharlemann model operates only for the so - called  favorably curved \" ( curved toward the rotation axis ) field lines , and for nearly orthogonal rotators .",
    "we consider the high - energy emission from pair cascades at the inner edge of the sg while arons ( 1983 , 1996 ) considered only the cr from primaries in the sg .",
    "the first two effects make it possible to initially boost the electron acceleration and then prolong it up to very high altitudes ( from few to several stellar radii ) where they generate pair - producing cr photons . as a result of pair formation at high altitudes ,",
    "the high - energy photons get emitted into a beam that is larger than the solid angle pertaining to the sg itself .",
    "these effects also enable the functioning of sgs in all pulsars which are above the cr pair - formation death lines ( see hmz02 for the details of our most recent death - line calculations ) .",
    "the second property significantly enlarges the allowed parameter space for the pulsar obliquity and viewing angles , in particular to small inclination and nearly aligned rotators where the original sg model failed to produce any acceleration . within the sg model proposed in this paper both double and single high - energy pulses are possible , and in the case of double pulses the separation between the peaks may be anywhere from near zero to 180 degrees .",
    "the asymmetry of double - peaked high - energy pulses ( one peak is higher than other ) , and misalignment of @xmath0-ray light curves with the x - ray light curves may be attributed to the effect of photon aberration which becomes important for high - energy photons generated at high altitudes .",
    "some other effects , such as e.g. effect of ns equation - of - state and effects of very strong stellar magnetic field will be discussed separately in our subsequent publications .",
    "also , we plan to investigate the details of formation of high - energy spectra in sgs of pulsars and perform comparison with the observational data .",
    "in this paper we calculated the predicted high - energy luminosity per unit solid angle from the sg of pulsars as a function of pulsar spin - down luminosity .",
    "our theoretical calculations agree well with the observational values for @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "given the fact that our model has only two major uncertainties , such as the uncertainty in efficiency of conversion of primary energetics into the energetics of @xmath0-ray emission and uncertainty of our calculation of sg width , the agreement is rather remarkable .",
    "note that the uncertainty of our sg width calculation translates into the uncertainty of order of a few for our calculation of high - energy luminosity per unit solid angle which is comparable to a typical uncertainty of the observations .",
    "our calculations depicted in figure 3 were performed for the efficiency of conversion of primary energetics into the energetics of high - energy emission @xmath148 , which does not seem to be unreasonable .",
    "the sg cascades will produce a component of electron - positron pairs at high altitudes , in addition to and distinct from the pair component produced by the low - altitude core cascades .",
    "one might speculate that these two pair components could be the origin of the core and conal radio emission components that have been identified from radio morphology studies ( e.g. rankin 1993 , lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "it will be interesting to explore the properties of these two pair components , which may have different characteristics .",
    "we presented our illustrative calculations of @xmath0-ray light curves and double - peaked pulse profiles for the parameters of the crab pulsar .",
    "we believe that our simulated high - energy light curves and pulse profiles can be used to constrain the obliquity and viewing angles for @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "we plan to perform detailed and extensive simulations of this kind in the future .",
    "we also plan to perform comparative analysis of two - pole and one - pole models for selected pulsars with available multifrequency light curves and indirect studies of their viewing and obliquity angles .",
