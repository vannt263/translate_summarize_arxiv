    "the study of many - body systems is a very active area of research , motivated by an acute observation by anderson over forty years ago  @xcite : _ more is different_. a system made of many bodies is not simply the sum of them , but something more complicated . in other words , we can not expect that the behavior of a many - body system is understood once the physics of its constituent parts is known .",
    "interactions , no matter how weak , significantly enrich the range of observable phenomena . due to these interactions many - body systems can appear in different phases each of them with peculiar properties . in the case of quantum systems",
    "we have quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) , which occur at zero temperature where thermal fluctuations are absent .",
    "in fact , they are driven by quantum fluctuations , which are fluctuations in the mean value of observables of a system due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "most of the known qpts are well described in the ginzburg - landau picture where the change from one phase to another is accompanied by a symmetry breaking process and the consequent development of a non - zero value for some order parameter .",
    "one of the most striking facts about qpts is their universality  @xcite .",
    "this means that different systems exhibit the same behavior at the critical ( or transition ) point , regardless of the microscopic details , _",
    "e.g. _ the type of interaction or nature of the system .",
    "therefore , and without loss of generality , we choose here to study exactly solvable spin - models in order to further understand qpts , and more generally criticality in quantum systems . in this regard",
    ", the @xmath0-model holds particular appeal because in addition to a qpt it also possesses another peculiar phenomenon : _ factorization _",
    "spin systems in an external magnetic field can show a fully factorized state in the ordered phase , _",
    "i.e. _ the phase in which spin - spin interactions prevails over the external field and the system is free to self - organize .",
    "early explanations involved the analysis of pairwise entanglement around the factorization field , @xmath1 .",
    "these studies showed that across @xmath1 the two spin entanglement undergoes a change from parallel to anti - parallel  @xcite , being zero exactly at @xmath1 .",
    "for this reason ground - state factorization has been referred to as an  entanglement transition \" .",
    "recently it has been related to a change in the symmetry of the ground state  @xcite indicating its fundamental importance .",
    "exploring both criticality and factorization using the tools of quantum information has proven fruitful  @xcite .",
    "while most studies consider only nearest neighbor pairs of spins , exploiting favourable figures of merit allows to access longer ranges  @xcite , finite temperatures  @xcite , and finite sizes  @xcite .",
    "small finite size systems also allow for the study of multipartite correlations  @xcite , an important topic in itself . here",
    "we show that a general figure of merit for quantum correlations , namely the quantum discord , is a versatile for tool to studying criticality and factorization , particularly in situations where entanglement is either severely constrained or has become identically zero . by studying long - range pairs in the thermodynamic limit we find that the quantum discord captures the main features of criticality and obeys a simple function for critical point estimation at finite temperatures . furthermore we find that the qualitative features of factorization , both at zero and finite temperature , can be explained by studying small systems and that such systems closely approximate the thermodynamic limit",

    "the fidelity between the finite size states and the exactly solved thermodynamic limit is calculated in sec .  [ fidelity ] , and in sec .  [ conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "let us first introduce the system under study and the mathematical treatment that allows us to calculate the quantities which will be the focus of our discussion in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we recall the definitions of the two main figures of merit , namely the entanglement of formation and the quantum discord .",
    "we consider the anisotropic @xmath0-model with periodic boundary conditions and assuming only nearest - neighbor interaction the hamiltonian is given by @xmath2 \\sigma_x^{i } \\otimes \\sigma_x^{i+1}+[1-\\gamma ] \\sigma_y^{i } \\otimes \\sigma_y^{i+1 } \\right ) + \\sigma_z^i \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the spin - spin interaction strength , @xmath4 $ ] is the anisotropy parameter , and @xmath5 are the usual pauli operators .",

    "we rigorously assess the differences and advantages arising from studying long - range ground - state and thermal quantum correlations in understanding criticality and factorization .",

    "this means that at the factorization point the infinite and finite states are virtually identical . while the small change in the fidelity in the vicinity of the critical point indicates that the qpt is only truly manifest in the thermodynamic limit , strong evidence can nevertheless be found by examining small chains of @xmath90 .",
    "the fact that @xmath96 at the factorization point gives further evidence that this phenomena is due to the mixing of highly symmetric energy levels of different parity which is a property independent of particle number .",

    "our results indicate that the long - range quantum discord is a versatile tool with which to study criticality .",
    "while the nearest - neighbor interaction strongly affects the properties at short ranges , at a suitably large site separation global features become more important and the quantum discord allows to faithfully capture the qpt and reflects the qualitative features associated with the qpt mechanism .",
    "the advantages of the long - range qd have been shown to not be restricted to zero temperature and we have found that it is possible to estimate the critical point for finite @xmath55 from a simple function . by considering small finite size systems we have shown the factorization phenomenon in this model",
    "can be fully explained in terms of the systems spectrum , and therefore that ground - state factorization and _ bonafide _ qpts are manifestly different phenomena .",
