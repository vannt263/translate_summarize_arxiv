    "there is also good numerical evidence @xcite that the critical behavior along the transition line in the dkca belongs to the dp class , except at one of the terminal points , where the asymptotic behavior is known exactly and belongs to the compact directed percolation ( cdp ) universality class @xcite . at this terminal",
    "point the transition is discontinuous and we have in fact two absorbing states : the vacuum and the completely filled state . using the damage spreading technique , martins _",
    "_ @xcite found another critical line separating the active phase into a nonchaotic and a chaotic phase .",
    "there is numerical evidence that the critical behavior along this transition line also belongs to the dp class , as expected on the basis of universality @xcite .",
    "the surface growth process generated by cellular automata ( ca ) was proposed by de salles _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to study wolfram s deterministic ca .",
    "these authors also used this process to identify the frozen / active phase transition in the dkca @xcite , where they showed that the hurst exponent @xmath0 attains a maximum at the transition .",
    "recently , atman and moreira @xcite demonstrated that the growth exponent @xmath1 also presents a cusp at criticality , and is more appropriate for detecting phase transitions than the method of de salles _ et al._. they used it to construct the dkca phase diagram and conjectured that the growth exponent method also can be used to detect phase transitions in other kinds of models .",
    "recently , redinz and martins @xcite used the hurst exponent method to find first and second order phase transitions in the @xmath2-state potts model ( for @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "bhattacharyya @xcite studied the dynamic critical properties of a related one - dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton , using two different procedures to generate the surface growth process .",
    "one of them is identical to the growth process studied by de salles _ et al .",
    "_ , and belongs to dp universality class .",
    "thus , the conjectures presented by bhattacharyya @xcite which imply dp - like scaling for this model are also valid here .",
    "basically , the procedure used by de salles _ et al._@xcite and by bhattacharyya @xcite , consists in transforming the spatiotemporal patterns generated by the dkca to a solid - on - solid ( sos ) particle deposition . at the critical line ,",
    "it yields a surface growth process with kinetic roughening , and the critical exponents can be measured following the scaling concepts developed by family and vicsk @xcite . very recently",
    ", similar methods were used by lauritsen and alava @xcite to study the edwards - wilkinson equation with columnar noise , by vespignani _",
    "@xcite to study sandpile models , and by dickman and muoz @xcite , to study the contact process ( cp ) .    in this work",
    ", we measure the scaling exponents at criticality in simulations , and compare them with known dp and cdp values .",
    "we use two different schemes to update the automaton , which lead to entirely different surface growth scaling properties . in section",
    "ii , we define the dkca , describe the two update schemes , and show how the surface growth process is generated , at the frozen / active and nonchaotic / chaotic transitions . in section iii , we present our numerical results and discuss the values obtained , comparing them with the predictions for the scaling exponents proposed by bhattacharyya @xcite and dickman and muoz @xcite .",
    "we discuss our conclusions in section iv .",
    "the dkca was proposed by domany and kinzel @xcite , who showed the existence of two phases : _ active _ and _ frozen_. a more detailed study , using simulation , was performed by martins _",
    "@xcite , in which a new phase within the active region - a _",
    "chaotic _ phase - was discovered through the damage spreading technique .",
    "the dkca consists of a linear chain of @xmath5 sites ( @xmath6 ) , with periodic boundaries , where each site @xmath7 has two possible states , conveniently denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath9 is given by the set \\{@xmath10}. in contrast to the deterministic ca studied by wolfram @xcite , the dkca is probabilistic : the rules for updating the system are given by conditional probabilities , which depend on the neighbors .",
    "we study two different schemes , one symmetric , the other nonsymmetric .",
    "the symmetric scheme is the original one proposed by domany - kinzel @xcite , while the nonsymmetric was used @xcite to simplify the algorithm ; its authors affirm that the two schemes are topologically equivalent .    in the symmetric scheme ,",
    "the process @xmath11 is defined on space - time points with @xmath12 _ even_. the state of site @xmath7 at time @xmath13 depends on @xmath14 and @xmath15 via the transition probability + @xmath16 $ ] , which takes the form : + @xmath17 + @xmath18 + @xmath19 + evidently , @xmath20 .    in the nonsymmetric scheme",
    ", the process is defined on _ all _ space - time points .",
    "the state of site @xmath7 at time @xmath13 depends on @xmath21 and @xmath22 , rather than on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as in the symmetric scheme .",
    "the transition probability @xmath25 $ ] is identical to @xmath26 $ ] given above for the symmetric case .",
    "it is easy to see that the two schemes are connected via a simple relabelling of space - time points ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . consider , for example , a _ history _",
    "@xmath27 in the symmetric scheme , that is , a sequence of configurations @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 finite ) , starting at @xmath31 with a finite number of active sites .",
    "let the probability of this history , given the initial configuration , be @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "a history @xmath33 in the nonsymmetric scheme can be defined in the same manner .",
    "note that there is a one - to - one correspondence between histories in the two schemes , given by @xmath34 since the transition probabilities in the two schemes are identical , the probabilities of corresponding histories are as well . to extend this correspondence to systems with periodic boundaries",
    ", we note that if the nonsymmetric system has @xmath5 sites , then the corresponding symmetric one has @xmath35 sites ; in the mapping defined above , we now take @xmath36 .",
    "an immediate result of this correspondence is that all scaling properties ( e.g. , critical exponents ) , as well as nonuniversal properties ( e.g. , phase boundaries between frozen , active , and chaotic phases in the @xmath37 plane ) , are identical in the two schemes . corresponding histories naturally look different in the two schemes : the nonsymmetric scheme represents a rotating frame of reference in which , moreover , distances are rescaled by a factor of 1/2 .",
    "thus , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , an interface between domains of 1 s and 0 s executes an unbiased random walk in the symmetric scheme , while in the nonsymmetric case such an interface has a mean velocity of 1/2 .",
    "the  light cone \" @xmath40 in the symmetric scheme becomes the pair of lines @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the nonsymmetric case .",
    "as will be seen below , this difference in frames of reference has important consequences for the surface dynamics in the nonsymmetric scheme .",
    "depending on the values of the parameters ( @xmath43 ) , the asymptotic ( @xmath44 ) state of the system is either _ frozen _ , with all sites having value 0 , or has a finite fraction of sites with value 1 , the _ active _ state .",
    "this is a second order phase transition , characterized by the critical exponents ofthe dp universality class .",
    "the surface growth process consists in accumulating ( summing ) all the values assumed by the variables @xmath45 over the first @xmath9 time steps : [ soma ] h_i(t ) ^t_=0 _ i ( )  .",
    "the differences between the schemes become explicit at this point . in figure 2",
    "we show the temporal evolution of the automaton and the profiles generated by the accumulation method , close to criticality @xmath46 , in each scheme .",
    "it is evident that the two schemes lead to entirely different profiles .",
    "( in this figure , we choose an initial condition of a single active site , to highlight the evolution of the automaton and profiles . )",
    "thus , we obtain growth processes , the nature of whose correlations can be investigated through the analysis of the roughness @xmath47 @xcite , defined by [ rugos ] w^2(l , t ) =  , where @xmath48 is the mean value of @xmath49 at time @xmath9 , and the brackets @xmath50 denote an average over realizations .",
    "we expect that @xmath47 has the scaling form @xcite [ scal ] w(l , t ) ~l^ f ( )  , where @xmath51 is a universal scaling function , @xmath52 is the roughness exponent , @xmath53 is the dynamic exponent and @xmath1 is the growth exponent .",
    "the function @xmath54 , at large times ( @xmath55 ) , and @xmath56 at short times ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "so at short times , we expect @xmath58 ; we measure @xmath1 from the slope of the @xmath59 plot of @xmath47 versus @xmath9 . at large times , the roughness saturates and becomes @xmath5-dependent : @xmath60 .",
    "the crossover time , @xmath61 , between these two regimes grows as @xmath62 .",
    "the exponents @xmath52 and @xmath63 are defined in the frozen phase just at the transition line . in the active phase ,",
    "the roughness does not saturate , growing instead as @xmath64 , corresponding to uncorrelated growth @xcite .",
    "the relations above , used to measure the scaling exponents , are valid just at criticality .",
    "the profiles have self - affine properties quantified by the hurst exponent @xmath0 , defined _ via _ w ( ) ~^h  , where @xmath65 is the width of the interface on length scale @xmath66 .",
    "we measure the hurst exponent , @xmath0 , in a profile generated very close to the transition .",
    "we apply the method introduced by moreira _",
    "et al _ @xcite , that consists in measuring the roughness around the straight line determined by a least - squares fit to a segment of the profile .",
    "the roughness @xmath67 , at the scale @xmath66 , is given by w(l,,t ) = _",
    "i=1^l w_i(,t ) where the local roughness @xmath68 is defined by @xmath69\\}^2~.\\ ] ] @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the linear fitting parameters to the profile on the interval @xmath72 $ ] centered at site @xmath7 .",
    "martins _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the damage spreading technique to show that the active phase of the dkca in fact consists of two phases , chaotic and nonchaotic .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the difference between two replicas started with different initial configurations .",
    "one lets the system evolve until it attains a stationary state , and then a replica of the configuration is created with some sites altered ( damage ) .",
    "the two replicas , one with state @xmath10 and the other with state @xmath73 , evolve with the same sequence of random numbers , and the difference between the configurations @xmath74 is measured .",
    "the fraction of sites in the two replicas with @xmath75 is called the hamming distance , defined as @xmath76 the stationary hamming distance is null in the non - chaotic phase and positive in the chaotic phase .",
    "to study the chaotic / non - chaotic boundary , we use a slightly different method , where the difference between the two automata is used to generate the surface growth process , as we did in the accumulation method [ acc2 ] h_i(t ) = ^t_=0 _ i ( )  .",
    "thus , the profile generated by the difference between the replicas behaves exactly as the profiles generated in the frozen / active boundary : the roughness reaches a stationary value in the non - chaotic phase and grows indefinitely in the chaotic phase .",
    "this behavior can be understood if we note that the difference between the replicas vanishes in the non - chaotic phase , which implies no contribution to the height @xmath49 , and is positive in chaotic phase , implying steady growth in the height .    in order to preserve the stationary density of active sites",
    "we generate a `` rotation '' damage at a certain time @xmath77 , in which the replica is rotated 180@xmath78 with respect to the original system , that is @xmath79 , subject to the periodic boundary condition .",
    "theoretical descriptions of surface growth scaling at absorbing - state phase transitions were proposed by bhattacharyya @xcite , and dickman and muoz @xcite .",
    "bhattacharrya proposed an analytical treatment in analogy to the random deposition ( rd ) process : considering an initial disordered state , the growth process can be described by a continuum equation , very similar to the rd process : [ rd ] = f + ( , t )  [ rd ] where @xmath80 is the average number of deposited particles and @xmath81 corresponds to the white noise ( @xmath82 ) in the deposition .    the difference between the surface growth processes generated by dkca and rd lies in the noise correlations .",
    "while rd involves spatially and temporally uncorrelated noise , the correlations in time and space developing in the dkca appears in the noise fluctuations of the accumulation method . for values of ( @xmath83 ) away from the critical line ( in the active phase ) , the correlation length @xmath84 and correlation time @xmath85 of the dkca are finite , which means that the noise in the deposition process is correlated over short ranges . in this limit",
    "the noise autocorrelation decays exponentially @xcite : ~e^-|-|/ e^-|t - t|/  .",
    "thus , the noise appears uncorrelated for times greater than @xmath85 , and the rd exponents are obtained in this limit .",
    "this behavior was confirmed in earlier simulations @xcite .",
    "as we approach the transition line , @xmath84 and @xmath85 increase , and it takes longer for the growth process to reach the rd limit . finally , at the critical line , both @xmath84 and @xmath85 diverge , and the correlations are long ranged , represented by a power law decay of the noise autocorrelation @xcite [ noise ] < ( , t),(,t ) > ~|-|^-2/ _ |t - t|^-2/ _  , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are , respectively , the critical exponents for the order parameter , correlation length and correlation time of the dkca .    the value of the growth exponent @xmath1 at the critical line can be derived from the continuum equation ( [ rd ] ) and the noise ( [ noise ] ) ; the width for an infinite substrate is expected to increase as the following power of the time @xcite w ( , t ) ~t^1-/ _  .",
    "as it is believed that this transition belongs to the dp universality class , the value of growth exponent is expected to be @xcite @xmath89    in previous work @xcite , atman and moreira showed that @xmath1 attains a maximum at the phase transition ( see fig.3 ) , and measured its value along the transition line of the dkca .",
    "this behavior of the exponent @xmath1 in the vicinity of the phase transition can be understood as follows .",
    "the growth rate , @xmath90 , at site @xmath7 is proportional ( in the frame of reference moving with the average velocity @xmath91 ) to the _ excess _ activity at that site .",
    "away from the critical point , the activity has a finite correlation lenght @xmath84 and correlation time @xmath85 .",
    "thus on scales much greater than @xmath84 , @xmath85 , the noise driving the surface growth is uncorrelated , and this process falls in the rd class , with @xmath92 . at the critical point , by contrast ,",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 diverge and we have instead the scaling relation @xmath93 @xcite , where the exponent @xmath94 is defined through the relation @xmath95 for the initial decay of the activity density @xmath96 , at the critical point , starting from @xmath97 . since , in one dimension , @xmath98 , we expect a jump in @xmath1 at the phase boundary . in simulations of finite - sized systems ,",
    "we expect not a discontinuity in @xmath1 but a sharp peak at the transition - see figure 3 ( very near to the critical point , @xmath99 , so that independently fluctuating regions are not present in the simulation . below the transition , the apparent value of @xmath100 due to the short lifetime of the activity ) .",
    "it is interesting note that for the dp universality class , @xmath101 and 0 for @xmath102 and 4 , respectively .",
    "thus we should expect @xmath1 to _ decrease _ at the phase boundary in @xmath103 .",
    "since the saturation of surface width is forced by the dkca , the crossover time @xmath104 behaves exactly as in dp , and the dynamic exponent is given by : t_~l^z  ,  z = z^dp = _ / _",
    "thus , the roughness exponent at the criticality is given by = z _ w 1.3286  .",
    "dickman and muoz @xcite studied the contact process using the surface growth representation .",
    "they demonstrated that the hurst exponent shows clear signs of anomalous scaling ( @xmath105 ) , but no evidence of multiscaling .",
    "they verified lpez scaling relation @xcite : @xmath106 . here , @xmath107 is the exponent associated with the divergence of the mean - square height gradient in the continuum growth equation that describes the contact process and related models , such as dp .",
    "inserting the known values in the relation above we have for the hurst exponent in the dp class : h=- z 0.643  .",
    "in table 1 , we summarize our results for the scaling exponents at the frozen / active and nonchaotic / chaotic transitions , and compare them with the values for the dp and cpd universality classes .    to extract the exponent values from our simulation data , we used the relations @xmath108 , valid at large times , @xmath109 , valid at short times and @xmath110 .",
    "the results show a strong dependence on the scheme used - symmetric or nonsymmetric . in the simulations , we average 10000 , 5000 , 2500 , 1000 , 500 , 250 and 100 samples at the critical point ( @xmath111 ) in systems with @xmath112 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 and 5000 sites , respectively . the initial condition in these samples was random , with 50% of sites active .",
    "the hurst exponent was measured following the procedure explained in subsection 2.2 .",
    "the results , shown in table i , represent an average over 100 random initial configurations in a system with @xmath113 .",
    "we observe a significant change in the value of the hurst exponent depending on the scheme used to update the automaton : in the symmetric scheme , we have @xmath114 , denoting a positive correlation in the profile ; in the nonsymmetric scheme @xmath115 , denoting a negative correlation .",
    "this behavior can be understood considering the nonsymmetric scheme as a deposition over a moving reference frame , which implies a lateral propagation of correlations .      for the symmetric scheme ,",
    "our results for the critical exponents agree with the dp values , except at terminal point @xmath116 where cdp values were obtained .",
    "the critical points ( @xmath111 ) were determined through the growth exponent method @xcite ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this method consists in fixing @xmath117 and varying @xmath118 until the maximum of the growth exponent @xmath1 is attained .    to determine the crossover time @xmath119 , we plot the fraction of realizations with at least one active site as a function of time ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , and define the crossover time such that half of the initial sample has frozen .",
    "the inset of figure 4 shows the power law behavior of the crossover time ; the slope of this line corresponds to the exponent @xmath63 .    to obtain the saturation width ,",
    "we let all samples evolve to the absorbing state , at a given system size , and determine the final averaged roughness .",
    "the exponent @xmath52 was measured as the slope of @xmath120 versus @xmath121 in a log - log plot . in figure 5",
    "we present the results for the saturation roughness in the cases : directed percolation ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 , symmetric ) , directed percolation ( @xmath124 , damage spreading ) , compact directed percolation ( @xmath39 , @xmath125 , symmetric ) and nonsymmetric dp ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 , nonsymmetric ) .    in order to verify family - vicsk scaling , we use the measured values for the scaling exponents to collapse the width curves at different system sizes to a single curve , as shown in figure 6 . note the collapse of the width curves , corroborating the family - vick scaling relation .",
    "it is important to note that the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath63 measured for the chaotic / nonchaotic transition at @xmath126 are slightly different from the exponents measured away from this point .",
    "this represents evidence of long - range correlations due the coincidence of the damage spreading and frozen / active transitions at this point , as pointed out by grassberger @xcite .",
    "a significant change in the roughening occurs in the nonsymmetric scheme , as shown in figure 7 ; we observe two distinct regimes in the roughness growth : a strongly correlated regime , for times @xmath127 , and a weak correlation regime , for longer times .",
    "again , this behavior can be understood by considering the nonsymmetric scheme as deposition in a moving reference frame .",
    "the correlations inherent in the dynamics are propagated by the moving reference frame until they reach the system size ; then the correlations due the local rules of the automaton take over , decreasing the growth rate of the roughness .",
    "these two regimes for the roughness growth implies that is not possible colapse all the curves using the family - vicsek scaling law .",
    "the apparent exponent values measured in the nonsymmetric scheme are markedly smaller : @xmath128 for nonchaotic / chaotic and frozen / active ( at @xmath129 ) transitions ; at @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "as discussed above , the growth exponent presents two values , depending on the roughness growth regime .",
    "the dynamic exponent @xmath63 must assume the dp value , as discussed in sec .",
    "2.1 ; in fact , @xmath132 for nonchaotic / chaotic and frozen / active ( at @xmath129 ) transitions , while @xmath133 at @xmath134 .",
    "growth surfaces generated by the spatiotemporal patterns of the dkca along its critical lines are studied .",
    "the critical roughening exponents , expected to belong to the dp universality class , were measured using power law relations valid at criticality . except for the terminal point @xmath39",
    ", all the scaling exponents agree with the dp values , in the symmetric scheme , and the scaling law @xmath135 remains valid . at @xmath39 ,",
    "we confirm cdp values for the exponents .",
    "since the fluctuations in uncorrelated regions are effectively superposed , it is not surprising that the apparent values of @xmath1 and @xmath52 are smaller in the nonsymmetric scheme . at the nonchaotic / chaotic transition ,",
    "the exponents measured also agree with the dp values .                                                        * figure 1 * spatial representation of dkca , in symmetric ( left ) and nonsymmetric ( right ) schemes , showing that the spatio - temporal patterns are identical in the two schemes , _",
