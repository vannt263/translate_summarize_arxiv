    "in recent years much attention has been paid to the emerging field of spintronics in semiconductor physics .",
    "much of the interest in this field is stimulated by the spin - field - effect transistor proposed by datta and das @xcite . in this proposal",
    "the rashba spin - orbit interaction is used to manipulate the charge transfer through a transistor like device by controlling the electron spin .",
    "the rashba interaction , which is the conventional spin - orbit interaction with a constant electric field , affects the electron spin like a momentum dependent magnetic field .    in practice",
    "the realization of the proposal by datta and das has proven to be a challenging task .",
    "in particular the injection of spins into non - magnetic semiconductors has turned out to be demanding , although successful injection has been reported by several authors @xcite . despite this fact the importance of the rashba interaction for the concept of the spin - field effect transistor has motivated further studies on its impact on charge and spin transport properties .",
    "particular attention has been paid , e.g. , to investigations of spin - accumulations@xcite and to the spin - galvanic effect@xcite , to an intrinsic spin - hall effect@xcite , and to the weak localization - antilocalization transition in the conductivity @xcite .    since in the rashba model the electron wave - vector is coupled to the spin the spin is quickly randomized by scattering events .",
    "therefore , the ballistic transport regime is the most important regime for the spin - field effect transistor proposed by datta and das .",
    "accordingly , most of the investigations focus on the situation in which the disorder energy is small compared to the rashba level splitting . recently , however , a generalized spin - field effect transistor has been proposed@xcite which is also expected to work in the diffusive regime , even if the rashba level splitting is small compared to the characteristic disorder energy .",
    "this raises the question which impact of the rashba interaction on the charge and spin transport properties can be expected in this limit .",
    "the aim of the paper is to provide a theory for the spin - relaxation in a a two - dimensional electron gas in the diffusive regime , in the limit that the characteristic disorder energy is large compared to the rashba level splitting on a time scale , in which inelastic processes can be ignored . to this end",
    "we generalize the non - nonlinear @xmath0-model to include also the impact of the rashba interaction and an in - plane electric field . using the generalized @xmath0-model",
    "we derive generalized bloch - equation and use these equations for the investigation of an initial magnetization .",
    "we consider charge carriers in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the motion of the charge carriers is described by the hamilton operator @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the momentum operator , @xmath3 is the effective mass , @xmath4 is a constant field in the two - dimensional plane , @xmath5 is a constant vector perpendicular to the plane , and @xmath6 is a random potential .",
    "the components of the vector @xmath7 are the pauli matrices . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the unit vectors in the two - dimensional plane and @xmath10 is a unit vector transverse to the plane . accordingly , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the random potential is characterized by a gaussian distribution function with zero mean and second moment @xmath13 here @xmath14 denotes the configuration average , @xmath15 is the density of states per spin at the fermi - level for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the single - particle scattering time .    in our investigation",
    "we focus on configuration averages of retarded and advanced green functions .",
    "these functions are solutions to the differential equation @xmath18 in this equation @xmath19 is a @xmath20 matrix in spin - space , @xmath21 is the @xmath20 unit matrix and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed energies . as a boundary condition",
    "we require that the green functions vanish at infinity . in this case",
    "the configuration averaged green functions are invariant against translations by a fixed vector @xmath24 if the energy @xmath22 is also shifted by @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , they satisfy the relationship @xmath26 to calculate the configuration averages of the green functions we use the field theoretical formulation of the refs . [ ] . in this formulation",
    "the replica trick is used to derive an effective action for the calculation of the configuration averaged green functions . following the standard derivation",
    "we find that for the problem at hand the partition function takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 here @xmath29 is a hermitian @xmath30 matrix field ( @xmath31-number of replica copies+ 2 components particle - hole space+ 2 components spin indices ) with components @xmath32 ( @xmath33- replica indices , @xmath34- particle - hole indices , @xmath35-spin indices ) .",
    "it satisfies the relationship @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the transposed matrix and @xmath38 the tr in eq.([b6 ] ) contains both the summation over the discrete indices and the integration over space .",

    "the index @xmath45 can take on values between @xmath46 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is understood that the limit @xmath47 is taken at the end of the calculation .",
    "to calculate the configuration - averaged green function in saddle - point approximation we now look on the saddle - point solution of the effective action @xmath48 , defined by @xmath49 the saddle - point values of @xmath29 and @xmath50 are diagonal with respect to the replica indices , as are the exact expection values .",

    "( [ b4 ] ) and ( [ b6 ] ) we find @xmath53 here @xmath54 .    to find an equation for the green function we use the gradient expansion @xcite . to this end",

    "furthermore , we consider only the dirty limit , in which both the disorder energy @xmath64 and @xmath65 are large compared to the rashba level splitting @xmath66 and assume that @xmath65 is large compared to @xmath64 . in this case",
    "we find that the self - consistent solution to the equations ( [ sp2 ] ) and ( [ sp4 ] ) takes the form @xmath67",

    "we would like to note that the simple structure of the saddle - point field is a consequence of the fact that the density of states for @xmath16 is constant . in an energy dependent density of states",
    "the saddle - point would pick up an energy and field dependent contribution from the density of states , which would modify eq.([sp5 ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations around the saddle - point solution are characterized by massive and soft modes .",
    "the latter describe the diffusion and spin relaxation properties we are interested in . in the field - theoretical formulation",
    "the existence of these modes is a consequence of a continuous symmetry of the effective action ( [ b6 ] ) which exists in the limit @xmath73 . in this limit",

    "the transport coefficients are given by @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "according to the eqs.([ga2 ] ) , ( [ ga3 ] ) and ( [ ga4 ] ) the equation for the particle transport decouples from the equations for the spin transport .",
    "the particle transport is described by the propagator @xmath126 .",
    "its equation of motion contains besides ordinary particle diffusion also the particle packet drift and the heating of the charge carriers .",
    "its physics is detailed in ref .",
    "the spatial components of the diffusion propagator , @xmath127 for @xmath128 , describe spin diffusion and relaxation .",
    "in addition to the diffusion , drift and heating processes present in the particle number diffusion equation , these equations also contain the spin relaxation and an electric - field dependent rotation of the spin - direction , which is induced by the rashba - interaction .",
    "we would like to note that the same equations can also be obtained from the ladder approximation .      in order to calculate the quantum corrections to the transport coefficients",
    "we also take into account the quartic terms in the expansion of @xmath129 with respect to @xmath104 and investigate the corresponding functional integral in one - loop approximation . doing so , we restrict the consideration to the linear response regime . in this case",
    "we can ignore the impact of the electric field on the transport coefficients and thus set the external electric field @xmath4 equal to zero in all loops .",
    "for charge transport the range of validity of this approximation has been discussed in ref .",
    "[ ] . there it has been shown that the impact of the field is negligible , as long as the spread of the particle packet is small compared to the distance of its center from the turning point .",
    "the time needed by a particle packet , which was a delta - pulse centered at @xmath130 at time @xmath131 and in which all particles have the same energy @xmath22 , to reach a width of the order of @xmath132 is for a typical experiment larger than @xmath133 s , as shown in ref .",
    "given that the typical lifetime of an initial magnetization is in the nanosecond range it seems to be reasonable to restrict the consideration to this limit .",
    "to one - loop order the particle number diffusion coefficient @xmath134 in eq.([ga2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath135 where @xmath136 @xmath137 and @xmath138 here @xmath139 is the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "these corrections have the same structure as the conventional anti - weak localization corrections to the conductivity @xcite . in a current relaxation experiment the frequency @xmath140 is effectively replaced by @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the inelastic phase breaking time which increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "accordingly , the particle number diffusion coefficient has a minimum as a function of the temperature at @xmath143 , where @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , the diffusion coefficient increases with decreasing temperature if @xmath145 .",
    "the opposite turns out to be true for the spin - transport coefficients . to one - loop order the spin diffusion coefficients @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    "are replaced by @xmath148 @xmath149 by @xmath150 the spin relaxation frequencies @xmath151 by @xmath152 and @xmath153 and the rotation frequency @xmath154 by @xmath155 in these equations @xmath140 has also to be replaced by @xmath141 if @xmath140 is smaller than @xmath141 .",
    "in contrast to the particle - number diffusion coefficient , however , the spin - transport coefficients have no minimum as a function of the temperature . in the range of applicability of the eqs.([wl5])-([wl9 ] ) the magnitude of the spin transport coefficients keeps decreasing with decreasing temperature even if @xmath145 .",
    "in contrast to the corrections to the particle- number diffusion coefficient , which are anti - localizing at low temperatures , the corrections to the spin transport coefficients always show a tendency to localization .    at this point",
    "we would also like to mention that the quantum corrections render the spin - transport coefficients weakly anisotropic .",
    "this anisotropy results from the fact that @xmath156 . however , since the difference between these quantities is of the order of @xmath157 this difference is small compared to the magnitude of the quantum corrections themselves , which are larger than the former by a factor of the order of @xmath158",

    "this dependence should be observable in optical experiments where it should reflect itself in deviations from the purely exponential decay .",
    "the equations ( [ ga3 ] ) and ( [ ga4 ] ) can be cast into the form ( [ dmm1 ] ) .",
    "doing so , it has to be taken into account that the bare transport coefficients are renormalized by the one - loop corrections of the preceding section.from eq.([ga3 ] ) we find @xmath177 and @xmath178 the spin current tensor takes the form    @xmath179    this tensor has been obtained by collecting all those terms in eq.([ga3 ] ) , which can be cast into a divergence .",
    "accordingly , the tensor ( [ dmm4 ] ) might deviate from the true spin - current tensor by terms which are annihilated by the divergence .",

    "however , since the magnetization decays when time elapses the current oscillations are not stable but decay too .",
    "this raises the interesting question whether these oscillations can be stabilized by some means .",
    "in the paper we have used field theoretical methods to derive the generalized bloch equations for the magnetization in a disordered two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "our equations apply for time scales which are large compared to the elastic scattering time , large compared to the phase - breaking time but small compared to energy relaxation time .",
    "accordingly , they take into account the particle- and spin diffusion , the drift induced by an external electric field in the plane , the heating of the charge carriers , the decay of the magnetization due to scattering events , and an electric field dependent rotation of the magnetization direction .",
    "the calculation of the transport coefficients shows that the impact of the quantum - corrections on the spin transport coefficients is different from that on the particle transport coefficients .",

    "this fact manifests itself in a minimum of the diffusion coefficient as a function of the temperature .",

    "this sets the situation for the spin - transport coefficients apart from that for the particle transport coefficients , which increase with decreasing temperature at sufficiently low temperature due to antilocalization .",
    "we have applied these equations to an investigation of the decay of a spatially homogeneous initial magnetization . in the absence of the in - plane electric field",
    "such a magnetization decays exponentially at large times@xcite .",
    "the decay is anisotropic .",
    "its transverse component decays twice as fast as its longitudinal components.the temperature dependence of the decay is given by the temperature dependence of the weak localization corrections to the transport coefficients , which lead to a logarithmic reduction of the decay rate with decreasing temperature .",
    "accordingly , the decay becomes slower with decreasing temperature .",
    "already a weak electric field renders the decay qualitatively different .",
    "if the electric field is smaller than a critical field it tips the magnetization only slightly over . if , however , the field exceeds the critical field @xmath201 the magnetization starts rotating in the plane transverse to @xmath222 .",
    "the rotation frequency depends on the degree of disorder , on the magnitude of the rashba - parameter , on the magnitude of the electric field and on temperature .",
