    "given the importance of the quality of the coupled - channels ( cc ) model to predict a reliable @xmath38 , we confirmed experimentally several of its predictions for the seven feshbach resonances investigated in this work .",
    "one example of the typical calibration measurements is shown in fig.[complete ] for the narrow resonance at @xmath7658.9  g in the @xmath60=0 state .",
    "for example , the centers of the feshbach resonances were experimentally determined , by measuring the atom losses versus the magnetic field after a constant waiting time .",
    "the resonance centers were identified with the loss maxima .",
    "also the positions of the zero - crossings of @xmath3 were determined as minima in the elastic collisional rate , after a forced evaporation procedure .",
    "the zero crossings were identified with the maxima in the temperature . in all cases",
    "we found a very good agreement within the typical experimental and theoretical uncertainties , as shown for example for the resonance centers in table [ tabsi : results ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the experiment are of the order of 0.1  g for the centers and 1  g for the widths .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties for the cc calculations are of the order of 0.1  g.    note that the theoretical parameters for the feshbach resonances are slightly different from those previously reported @xcite , which considered only @xmath77-wave scattering ; the present calculations include instead also @xmath50- and @xmath78-wave scattering . in table",
    "[ tabsi : results ] we also report a narrow @xmath50-wave resonance , also predicted by the cc model , in the vicinity of the narrow resonance at @xmath7658.9  g. its presence limited the range of accessible scattering lengths to @xmath79 .",
    "we used particular care in determining the centers of the two narrow resonances , where the interesting region of @xmath13 appears at detunings @xmath80 of the order of 0.1  g , which is also our typical accuracy in the calibration of the magnetic field . in these cases ,",
    "the resonance center was determined also from the measurement of the three - body loss coefficient on both sides of the resonance , thus achieving a precision as low as 0.03  g. one measurement is shown in fig.[complete]c . in absence of a detailed model of the loss rates very close to the resonance center , we performed a gaussian fit of the loss maximum , taking the center as @xmath53 and the halfwidth at 1/@xmath81 as the uncertainty .",
    "the values for @xmath53 measured via the plain losses and @xmath25 are in good agreement between themselves and with the theory , with a typical deviation below 0.1  g.     is determined as the difference between the molecular ( red squares ) and the atomic ( green squares ) maxima in the radiofrequency transfer . for the atomic transition we plot the deviations of the observed radio frequency transitions to the expected ones .",
    "the data from coupled - channels model of ref.@xcite ( blue circles ) has been shifted to lower fields by 0.08  g to match the experiment .",

    "the inset shows a typical molecule association spectrum from the @xmath60=-1 to the @xmath60=0 state , where the signal is the number of atoms left in @xmath60=-1 after the radiofrequency transfer .",

    "we employed a standard technique : a weakly - interacting bose - einstein condensate was prepared in the @xmath60=-1 state , and then transferred to the @xmath60=0 state by a radio - frequency pulse . at small detunings from the resonance",
    ", we observed a transfer to both the atomic and a molecular state , as shown in the example in the inset of fig.[be ] .",
    "the atomic signal is power broadened because the rabi frequencies of the atom - molecule and atom - atom transitions are very different already for small detunings .",
    "we fitted the spectra of the atomic and molecular signals with gaussian distributions .",
    "the molecular binding energy @xmath83 was determined as twice the energy detuning between the atomic and molecular peaks , taking conservatively as uncertainty the quadrature of the individual widths of the fitted gaussian .",
    "for example ,",
    "fig.[be ] shows the measured @xmath83 for the resonance centered at @xmath7658.9  g , for which we found a very good agreement with the cc model , within the 0.1  g uncertainties of both the cc model and the experiment .",
    "a similar agreement was found also for the other narrow resonance at @xmath7665.6  g.    it is known that the near - threshold molecular structure of @xmath0k can not be rigorously interpreted in terms of one- or two - channel models over a wide range of magnetic field values , because of the presence of broad avoided crossings @xcite .",
    "this makes the calculation of the intrinsic length through the equation @xmath84 difficult , since the relative molecular magnetic moment @xmath20 changes with the magnetic field .",
    "the values of @xmath20 previously reported in @xcite , represent indeed the average magnetic moment in a finite region of magnetic fields close to the resonance centers .    to determine @xmath15 more accurately , we first extracted from our numerically calculated collision phase shift the value @xmath85 of the effective range at resonance ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we then used the relation between @xmath85 and the intrinsic resonance length @xmath87 obtained within a quantum - defect model in ref.@xcite .    to gain more analytical insight we also used an exactly solvable two - channel model developed in ref.@xcite , which has already been adapted to narrow and intermediate - strength feshbach resonances such as the ones in @xmath0k",

    "the binding energy for @xmath88 is expressed as @xmath89 , with @xmath90 where the effective range is @xmath91 here @xmath92 is a fitting parameter of the order of the van der waals radius .",
    "we fitted the calculated binding energies for all seven feshbach resonances investigated in the experiment , using the calculated values for the background scattering length @xmath93 and for the resonance width @xmath17 to evaluate @xmath38 , while leaving both @xmath92 and @xmath15 as fit parameters . in the fit we employed cc data in a range of detunings @xmath94 , with a maximum @xmath95 of the order of @xmath96 for each resonance",

    "we recall that to determine @xmath25 we fitted the coupled equations for @xmath105 and @xmath106 at each magnetic field , obtaining the three quantities @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 . the typical statistical errors are : 20% for @xmath110 ; 3% for @xmath108 ; 10% for @xmath109 . the overall relative statistical error on @xmath25 , obtained by summing the individual contributions ,",
    "typically amounts to 60% , and is quantified by the error bars in figs.2 - 3 of the main paper .",
    "in addition , we have two systematic sources of error on @xmath25 .",
    "the first one is a 30% uncertainty on @xmath108 , which comes from our imperfect knowledge of the actual absorption cross - section of the atoms .",
    "the second one comes from the uncertainty in the mean trap frequency @xmath36 , which is contained in the parameter @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this was measured by exciting a sloshing motion of the atomic sample along the three trap axes , with a typical uncertainty of 20% .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty is therefore as large as 200% .",
    "this implies that the @xmath25 scale is determined only up to a factor of about 3 .",
    "the unitarity - limited three - body rate contains instead only one experimental parameter , the temperature : @xmath44 . in our analysis",
    "we used the initial temperature @xmath109 to estimate @xmath113 , with an overall uncertainty that is negligible with respect to the scaling factor above .",
    "when fitting the experimental data for the five broad resonances , we allowed for a single fitting factor in front of the overall rate @xmath45 .",
    "in all cases we found factors smaller than 3 , in agreement with the estimated uncertainty .        in principle , atoms in the excited @xmath60=0,-1 states can decay also via two - body relaxation .",
    "the two - body rate is normally very small , since it involves processes that change the total @xmath60 , but it can become relevant close to the feshbach resonances , where the universal behavior for the two body constant @xmath114 sets in . while the measured @xmath25 at the broader feshbach resonances follows the expected @xmath115 behavior , a possible reason for the slower variation of @xmath25 with @xmath3 at the two narrow feshbach resonances might be indeed a contribution of two - body processes , namely dipolar relaxation of a pair of @xmath60=0 atoms into @xmath60=1 atoms . to investigate this possibility , we tried to model the observed evolution of @xmath105 and @xmath106 also as a two - body decay , for which the rate equations are @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the mean density .",
    "a compact solution for the average density can be found as @xmath118 which is nominally different from the analogous solution for @xmath119 in presence of three - body losses @xmath120 however , the two solutions are not too different , and the experimental data can in general be fitted almost equally well using the two models .",
    "since @xmath121 can be predicted exactly by the cc model , we could however compare a @xmath121 fitted from the experimental data assuming only two - body losses , with the calculated one .",
    "as shown in fig.[k2ab ] , this comparison indicates that the two - body decay is unlikely to play a role in the observed decay for the resonance at 58.9  g , but might indeed contribute to the observed background losses for the resonance at 65.6  g. note however that we estimate a typical uncertainty of about 2 in the overall scale of the measured @xmath121 , so that further detailed experiments , possibly with different @xmath109 and @xmath108 will be necessary to assess the real impact of two - body losses even in the latter case . in any case , the measured loss maxima can not be explained at all in terms of two - body losses .",
    "a similar analysis we performed for the five broader resonances indicates that in those cases the two - body losses are more than one order of magnitude smaller that the three - body ones ."

    "<S> in particular , the model of ref.@xcite predicts that a crossover between the two regimes of broad and narrow resonances would take place around @xmath67 , as shown in fig.[tbp ] . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the regime of @xmath62 should be reached only for excited efimov states , while the first one has a slightly smaller @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> although an increase of @xmath69 with decreasing @xmath22 might be present in the experimental data , there is a clear disagreement with such predictions . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on @xmath70li and @xmath71cs have also measured similar values for @xmath5 at three intermediate resonances with @xmath72 @xcite , indicating that this behavior might not be peculiar of @xmath0k .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that for the two narrowest resonances @xmath69 is only a factor of two larger than @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this observation seems to indicate that the three - body potential can support a bound state that resides only in the region with hyperradius @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a regime that was not accessible in previous one - channel models , and a multi - channel approach will be presumably necessary to model the experimental observations .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our study showed an apparent universal behaviour of the three - body parameter on several different feshbach resonances of the same atomic species , down to a resonance strength @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives important information on the three - body physics in this narrow - resonance regime , where one expects a combined role of the open and closed molecular channels . </S>",
    "<S> our results will provide a benchmark for three - body multichannel models . by employing a narrower , low - field feshbach resonance in @xmath0k @xcite , further experiments probing a regime of even smaller @xmath75 might be possible in the future .    </S>",
