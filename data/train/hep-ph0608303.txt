    "the standard model ( sm ) predicts the existence of one scalar particle , the higgs boson ( h ) .",
    "the higgs boson is the only particle of the sm which has not been found until now .",
    "electroweak precision data mainly collected at cern lep and slac slc in combination with the direct top - quark mass measurement at the tevatron would favour a light higgs boson with a mass below about 200  gev at the 95% confidence level , while the direct search at lep leads to a lower bound of 114  gev at the 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "this mass range is compatible with the so - called intermediate - mass range , defined by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the mass of the w boson and the higgs boson , respectively . in this mass regime",
    "the decay of the higgs boson into a pair of photons is an important detection channel at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) due to its clear signature , though the branching fraction does not exceed 0.3% .",
    "furthermore , this decay channel is useful in determining the properties of the higgs boson . at a future international linear collider ( ilc )",
    "precision measurements would be possible .",
    "in particular , at the ilc the two photon mode could be made possible , which allows for the production of higgs bosons via the fusion of two photons . this way a precise measurement of @xmath4 , with a precision of 2.3% for @xmath5  gev  @xcite , would be possible . also the cp - properties of the higgs boson",
    "could be studied at the ilc operating in the two photon mode .",
    "a comprehensive review of sm higgs boson physics is given in  @xcite .",
    "the higgs - decay into two photons is furthermore sensitive to new charged , heavy particles of physics beyond the sm . for these reasons",
    "a precise prediction of the partial decay width @xmath6 in the intermediate - mass range is required . to this end",
    "the two - loop calculations of the partial decay width have recently been completed .    here , a short review of these calculations is given focusing on the ew contributions .",
    "firstly , in section  2 the born level results are given .",
    "the individual ew contributions at two - loop order are discussed in the following sections , namly the corrections due to light fermions in section  3 , the top - quark - induced corrections in section  4 , and the purely bosonic corrections in section  5 .",
    "the sum of these contributions together with the qcd corrections at two - loop order are presented in section  6 , which also contains the conclusion .",
    "at born level there exist two diagrams for each fermion ( fig .  [ haa1ltop ] ) .",
    "however , only the heavy top - quark contributes sizeably while the other contributions are negligible .",
    "in addition one has to consider 26 diagrams with virtual w bosons , goldstone bosons , and ghosts ( fig .",
    "[ haa1lw ] ) .",
    "since heavy particles give sizeable contributions to this loop - induced process , it is sensitive to new charged particles of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the exact results for the decay rate have been known since long  @xcite .",
    "however , it is instructive to have a look at the expansion of these results in the external momenta . expansions will partly be performed also at the two - loop level , where the exact results are not known .",
    "a natural choice for the expansion parameters is @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the approximation consisting of the first three terms of the expansion in @xmath9 is practically indistinguishable from the exact result up to @xmath10 for the case of the diagrams with virtual top - quarks . in the second case ,",
    "the convergence is slightly worse , since @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath12 and the exact result behaves like @xmath13 in this limit .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath5  gev , 140  gev , and @xmath14 , the approximation by five expansion terms deviates from the exact result by as little as 0.3% , 1.6% , and 19.9% , respectively .    in the intermediate - mass regime of the higgs boson",
    "the contribution from virtual bosons and ghosts dominates , while it is partially cancelled by the contribution due to virtual top - quarks .",
    "light fermions can contribute at the two - loop level since it is possible to avoid the direct coupling of the fermions to the higgs boson .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ lfnlodias ] .",
    "furthermore , one has to sum over all generations of light fermions .",
    "therefore one can expect a non - negligible contribution due to light fermions .",
    "the respective calculation was done in  @xcite . in this case",
    "an asymptotic expansion is not possible since thresholds occur at @xmath15 and at @xmath16 , while we consider a higgs boson mass just in this mass range .",
    "for this reason an analytic calculation was performed .",
    "the authors considered the limit of vanishing masses for the light fermions and employed the background field method ( bfm ) quantisation framework in order to reduce the number of diagrams .",
    "then they projected out the scalar amplitudes and reduced them to a set of linearly independent ones .",
    "these were in turn reduced to a set of master integrals by means of the integration - by - parts technique .",
    "finally the master integrals were calculated using differential equations and the results were expressed in terms of generalised harmonic polylogarithms .",
    "the unphysical singularity at the 2w - threshold was regularised through the introduction of the width of the w boson by performing the replacement @xmath17 .",
    "it could be shown that the result is independent on the regulator except in the region between 150  gev and 170  gev , where the result has to be taken with some caution .",
    "the relative correction as a function of the higgs boson mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ lfges ] . for comparison also the two - loop qcd result is shown and the sum of these corrections .",
    "it turns out that in the intermediate - mass region of the higgs boson the corrections due to light fermions are small but indeed non - negligible , between 1% and  2% .",
    "the top - quark - induced corrections have first been considered in the limit of a large top - quark mass in  @xcite .",
    "sample diagrams for this class of corrections are depicted in fig .",
    "[ haa2ltop ] . in order to obtain the correction of order @xmath18(@xmath19 ) as an expansion in @xmath20 up to and including the terms of order @xmath18(@xmath21 )",
    "the asymptotic expansion technique was applied taking the bottom - quark to be massless .",
    "furthermore , the on - shell - scheme , dimensional regularisation , the anticommuting definition of @xmath22 , and a general @xmath23-gauge have been employed .",
    "also the tadpole diagrams had to be included since the @xmath24-terms cancel out non - trivially in the sum of contributions from genuine tadpole diagrams , counterterms and non - trivial terms in the asymptotic expansion . in fig .",
    "[ topges ] the normalised amplitude is shown as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "it turns out that the convergence behaviour is similar to the one at born level for the diagrams with virtual bosons and ghosts . for this reason",
    "it was assessed that the approximation should be very good for higgs boson masses up to 140  gev and still reasonably good up to the right edge of the intermediate - mass regime . by now",
    "also the full top - quark - induced corrections have been completed in  @xcite , where also the leading term in the top - quark mass could be recovered .",
    "the method of the calculation is the same as in the case of the purely bosonic corrections and will be reviewed in the respective section . in fig .",
    "[ nloewges ] the result is shown as the relative correction to the born result as a function of the higgs boson mass .",
    "the correction lies in the range between 2.5% and  3% .",
    "also the result for the leading term is shown in this figure .",
    "it is obviously a very good approximation to the full result .",
    "finally the purely bosonic corrections have to be taken into account , one sample diagram of which is shown in fig .  [ haa2lbos ] .",
    "the calculation of these corrections was also performed in  @xcite .",
    "the authors employed the bfm quantisation framework and used the tadpole counterterm in order to cancel the diagrams containing a tadpole .",
    "they projected out the relevant form factor and performed a taylor expansion in the parameter @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the external momentum of the higgs boson , up to and including terms of order @xmath18(@xmath27 ) .",
    "the gauge parameter was renormalised in order to obtain finite terms in this expansion which in turn allows for an improvement of the results by means of a pad approximation . the respective result is also shown in fig",
    ".  [ nloewges ] , where it is denoted as ym .",
    "its value is around 2% with a sign opposite to the corrections discussed above .",
    "the purely bosonic corrections have a different sign compared to the other corrections as is the case at born level",
    ". therefore a partial cancellation takes place between the individual ew contributions as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ nloewges ] .",
    "the qcd corrections at the two - loop level ( see  @xcite , for the result at three loops see  @xcite ) are also small and cancel partially against the resulting ew corrections .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ nloges ] .",
    "the reason for the smallness of the qcd result could be due to the fact that only the born level diagrams containing virtual quarks are affected by qcd corrections .",
    "note , that also in the case of the qcd corrections at two loops a naive expansion in the external momenta is possible , again leading to a rapidly converging series as is the case for the born level contributions of the diagrams with virtual top - quarks .",
    "the sum of the complete ew corrections ranges from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for a higgs boson mass between 100  gev and 150  gev .",
    "the full two - loop result amounts to less than @xmath30 .",
    "the nlo calculation therefore already gives a very reliable prediction .",
