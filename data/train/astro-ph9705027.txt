    "during the past year , scientists and the public at large have been galvanized by the discovery of planets and brown dwarfs around nearby stars ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1996 ; oppenheimer  1995 ; butler & marcy 1996 ) and by evidence for ancient life on mars ( mckay  1996 ) .",
    "these extraordinary findings have dramatically heightened interest in the age ",
    "old questions of where we came from and whether we are unique in the cosmos .",
    "not unexpectedly , a general understanding of stellar and planetary origins does not yet exist .",
    "planetary science has focussed over the past three decades on the planets of our own solar system and on the chemical and physical clues to their formation accessible by direct examination and sampling .",
    "astronomy has pushed simultaneously outward to cosmology and inward to understand the formation of stars and planets .",
    "a long  term goal of theorists should be the integration of these two realms and the creation of a new interdisciplinary science of planets , stars , and life .",
    "the new planet and brown dwarf discoveries ( table 1 and figure 1 ) collectively have an exceptional and unexpected range of masses , semi ",
    "major axes , eccentricities , and primaries .",
    "the unpredicted variety among these new giant planets / brown dwarfs poses fundamental questions about the origin of planetary and stellar systems . while the new planets were all discovered by _",
    "indirect _ means , it is only via _ direct _ detection ( imaging and spectroscopy ) that extrasolar planets can be adequately characterized and studied . with this in mind",
    ", we have embarked upon a new and thorough theoretical study of the structure , spectra , colors , and evolution of extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs ( marley  1996 ; burrows  1997 ) .",

    "+    however , building upon our previous experience in the modeling of brown dwarfs and m stars , we ( burrows  1995 ; saumon  1996 ; and guillot  1996 ) first published grey models of extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) .",
    "this early generation of egp models in the mass range 0.0003 to 0.015 ( @xmath9 0.3to 15 ) was in aid of both nasa s and esa s ( leger 1993 ) embryonic plans to search for extrasolar planets .",
    "figure 2 depicts the bolometric luminosity evolution of egps for ages from 10@xmath11 to 5@xmath12 years .",
    "note that younger and more massive objects are _ significantly _ brighter and , hence , more easily detected .    to    some of the space platforms and new ground  based facilities that have or will obtain relevant infrared and optical data include the hst ( wfpc2 , nicmos ) , the irtf , the mmt 6.5-meter upgrade , the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) ( planned for mt .",
    "graham ) , keck s i and ii ( with hires ) , the european iso , ukirt , and sirtf , along with a large number of medium to large  size telescopes optimized or employed in the near  infrared .",
    "one project of keck i and ii , under the aegis of nasa s aseps-0 ( astronomical study of extrasolar planetary systems ) program , will be to search for giant planets around nearby stars . a major motivation for the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) supported by nasa is the search for extrasolar planets .",
    "recently , dan goldin , the nasa administrator , outlined a program to detect planetary systems around nearby stars that may become a future focus of nasa .",
    "this vision is laid out in the _ exploration of neighboring planetary systems ( exnps ) roadmap _ ( see also the `` tops '' report , 1992 ) .",
    "earlier work generally consisted of evolutionary models of planets of 1@xmath13 and below , beginning with graboske  ( 1975 ) .",
    "that work explored the evolution of the low ",
    "mass objects jupiter and saturn from an age of @xmath14 years to the present ( @xmath94.6 gyr ) . working down from higher masses ,",
    "grossman and graboske ( 1973 ) extended their calculations of brown dwarf evolution to as low as 12 @xmath15 , but had to limit their study to ages less than about 0.1 gyr .",
    "black ( 1980 ) used the results of grossman & graboske ( 1973 ) and graboske  ( 1975 ) to infer simple power - law relations for the variation of luminosity @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 as a function of mass @xmath18 and time @xmath19 .",
    "black s relations are roughly valid for objects close in mass to 1 @xmath15 and close in age to 4.5 gyr .",
    "however , black s formulas become inaccurate at earlier ages and at larger masses .",
    "egps will radiate in the optical by reflection and in the infrared by the thermal emission of both absorbed stellar light and the planet s own internal energy . in burrows  ( 1995 ) , saumon  ( 1996 ) , and guillot  ( 1996 ) , we evolved egps with masses ( @xmath18 ) from 0.3@xmath20(the mass of saturn ) through 15and included the effects of `` insolation '' by a central star .",
    "giant planets may form preferentially near 5 a.u .",
    "( boss 1995 ) , but as the new data dramatically affirm , a broad range of @xmath6s can not be excluded . whether a 15object is a planet or",
    "a brown dwarf is largely a semantic issue , though one might distinguish gas giants and brown dwarfs by their mode of formation ( e.g. in a disk or `` directly '' ) . physically , compact hydrogen - rich objects with masses from 0.00025 @xmath20 through 0.25 @xmath20 form a continuum .",
    "however , egps above @xmath913@xmath20 do burn deuterium for up to 10@xmath21 years .",
    "on the same october day on which 51 peg b was reported ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , a caltech team announced the _",
    "direct _ detection of the brown dwarf gliese 229 b ( geballe  1995 ; oppenheimer  1995 ; nakajima  1995 ; matthews  1996 ) . using a prototype adaptive optics system on the old mmt ,",
    "roger angel of steward observatory obtained a k  band image of gl 229 b , thus confirming its detection .",
    "this object has an estimated luminosity of @xmath22 , an effective temperature below 1200 k , and clear signatures of methane and h@xmath23o vapor in its spectrum .",
    "since there can be no stars cooler than 1700 k , with luminosities below @xmath24 , or with methane bands , gl 229 b s status as one of the long  sought brown dwarfs is now unimpeachable .    to constrain the properties of the brown dwarf gl229 b , we ( marley  1996 ) constructed a grid of non  grey model atmospheres with @xmath25 ranging from 700 to 1200 k and @xmath26 cm s@xmath27 .",
    "we assumed a standard solar composition for the bulk of the atmosphere .",
    "refractory elements ( for example fe , ti , and silicates ) condense deep in the atmosphere for @xmath28 k , and thus have negligible gas  phase abundance near the photosphere , as is also true in the atmosphere of jupiter . for an atmosphere similar to that of gl229 b ,",
    "chemical equilibrium calculations indicate that c , n , o , s , and p are found mainly in the form of methane ( ch@xmath29 ) , ammonia ( nh@xmath30 ) , water ( h@xmath23o ) , hydrogen sulfide ( h@xmath23s ) , and phosphine ( ph@xmath30 ) , respectively .",
    "our model atmospheres incorporate opacities due to collision  induced absorption by h@xmath23-h@xmath23 ( borysow & frommhold 1990 ) and h@xmath23-he ( zheng & borysow 1995 , and references therein ) , free - free absorption by h@xmath31 ( bell 1980 ) , bound - free absorption by h@xmath32 ( john 1988 ) , and rayleigh scattering .",
    "the absorptions of nh@xmath30 , ch@xmath29 , and ph@xmath30 are calculated using the hitran data base ( hilico  1992 ) with corrections and extensions .",
    "additional tabulations are used where necessary for @xmath33 ( strong  1993 ) , especially shortwards of @xmath34 .",
    "data for h@xmath23o and h@xmath23s are computed from a direct numerical diagonalization ( wattson & rothman 1992 ; schwenke  1997 ) . absorption by co ( pollack _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) and ph@xmath30 opacity is included in the spectral models , but not in the temperature profile computation .",
    "the baseline models assume that the atmosphere is free of clouds .",
    "this assumption must be reconsidered in the future ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "for the temperature profile computation , molecular opacity is treated using the k  coefficient method ( goody  1989 ) . after a radiative ",
    "equilibrium temperature profile is found , the atmosphere is iteratively adjusted to self - consistently solve for the size of the convection zones , given the specified internal heat flux . with the radiative  convective temperature ",
    "pressure profiles , high - resolution synthetic spectra can be generated by solving the radiative transfer equation .",
    "figure 3 shows a comparison of a theoretical spectrum of gl229 b with the ukirt spectrum from 1 to 2.5 @xmath35ms . including stray light in the optics improves the fit in the h@xmath23o troughs dramatically and a t@xmath36 near 1000 k is indicated",
    "this is far below the stellar edge t@xmath36 of @xmath91750 k for solar metallicity , indicating that gl229 b is a true brown dwarf with a mass near 30@xmath3710 .    to    as part of our recent theoretical explorations after the gl229 b campaign , we have found significant flux enhancements relative to blackbody values in the window at 45 @xmath35 m and in the j ( 1.2 @xmath35 m ) and h(1.6 @xmath35 m ) bands for t@xmath36s from 100 through 1300 k. at temperatures below @xmath9600 k , the widely - used k band at 2.2 @xmath35 m is greatly suppressed _ relative to the j and h bands _ by strong ch@xmath29 and h@xmath38h@xmath23 absorption features .",
    "the j , h , and m band enhancements are a consequence of the opacity holes in those bands and the significant redistribution of flux caused predominantly by pressure  induced h@xmath23 absorption longward of 5 @xmath35ms and strong absorption features of ch@xmath29 and h@xmath23o in the near and mid  infrared .",
    "figure 4 depicts some preliminary theoretical spectra for objects from 99 to 880 k at a gravity of @xmath39 cm s@xmath27 ( burrows  1997 ) .",
    "infrared colors derived from these spectra are easily distinguished from those of m dwarfs .",
    "in particular , j - k and h - k colors get _ bluer _ with decreasing t@xmath36 and are shifted relative to those for m dwarfs and hot brown dwarfs by many magnitudes .",
    "the gravity dependence of the emergent spectra is weak . for comparison , in figure 4",
    "the corresponding blackbody spectra are provided .",
    "while the giant planets of the solar system can be helpful guides at the low-@xmath25 limit of our calculations , the range demonstrated by their spectra warns us against simple generalizations .",
    "the extremely non  blackbody nature of both brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets is manifest and rather startling .",
    "search strategies should be redesigned accordingly .",
    "the present pace of giant planet discovery and nasa s future plans for planet searches suggest that many more objects in the jovian mass range ( and above ) will be identified and subject to spectroscopic examination .",
    "spectra and colors are worth little if they can not be attached to masses , ages , and compositions .",
    "we have already preformed the first rudimentary calculations of the atmospheres , evolution , and spectra of extrasolar giant planets , in a variety of stellar environments . as our recent work on gl229 b and",
    "figure 4 show , the blackbody assumption can be orders  of  magnitude off in the j , h , l@xmath40 , and m bands .",
    "therefore , a complete and self  consistent theory of the evolution , colors , spectra , and structure of extrasolar giant planets is a crucial prerequisite for any credible direct search for planets around nearby stars .",
    "the new science of extrasolar planets , a merger of both planetary and stellar astronomy , is rapidly being born .",
    "the authors would like to thank jim liebert , roger angel , christopher sharp , andy nelson , david sudarsky , willy benz , george gatewood , geoff marcy , and david trilling for many simulating and fruitful conversations during the last hectic 18 months .",
    "they would also like to acknowledge the support of nasa via grant nagw2817 and of the nsf via grant ast93 - 18970 .",
