    ", an abstraction of an important equivalence class of matrices often plays a central role : an oriented matroid .",
    "the theory of oriented matroids ( see @xcite ) provides us with a multitude of definitions for an oriented matroid that can be viewed as reflecting the variety of objects that a matrix can represent .",
    "these definitions via circuit or cocircuit axioms ( @xcite , p.  103 ) , sphere systems ( @xcite , p.  227 ) , gramann plcker relations ( chirotope axioms ) ( @xcite , p.  126 , p.  138 , @xcite ) , hull systems ( @xcite ) , to mention just a few of them , differ a lot with respect to their motivational aspects , their algorithmical efficiency or their relation to the actual application .",
    "each definition provides in general an additional insight for the motivating problem . in the research monograph on oriented matroids , @xcite ,",
    "three chapters are devoted to axiomatics concerning oriented matroids and to the topological representation theorem for oriented matroids .",
    "this central theorem in the theory of oriented matroids due to lawrence shows the equivalence of oriented matroids defined via sphere system axioms with oriented matroids defined via , say , the circuit axioms .",
    "this remarkable result asserts that each oriented matroid has a topological representation as an oriented pseudosphere arrangement , even a piecewise - linear one , cf .",
    "edmonds and mandel @xcite . other authors ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    "have later simplified or complemented the original proof , but all use fundamentally the same approach : the face lattice ( tope ) formalism for oriented matroids and a shelling order to carry through the construction .    finding a reasonably direct proof in rank @xmath0 , one that would rely on the structural simplicity of the planar case , has been posed as an open problem in the research monograph @xcite ( exercise 6.3 ) . in @xcite",
    "such a proof in the rank 3 case was given .",
    "unlike the previous ones , this was based on _ hyperline sequences _ , an equivalent axiomatization for oriented matroids which is particularly natural in rank @xmath0 . in this article",
    "we generalize this proof to the arbitrary rank case .",
    "the proof is inductive , direct and uses only one advanced result from topology , the generalized schnflies theorem .",
    "the motivation for introducing hyperline sequences in rank 3 was presented in detail in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "here we use the generalization to arbitrary rank , formally defined in section  [ sec : hls ] .",
    "the motivation is similar .",
    "here is a brief account of it .",
    "we use an index set @xmath1 with its standard total order .",
    "we consider a labeled finite point set @xmath2 @xmath3 , ordered according to their labels .",
    "we assume that the point set @xmath4 affinely spans @xmath5 .",
    "we endow the affine euclidean space @xmath5 with an orientation , i.e. , for any @xmath6element subset of affinely independent points , we can tell whether the ordering of their indices defines a positive , or a negative , oriented simplex , respectively .",
    "every @xmath7element subset of affine independent points of @xmath4 defines via the ordering of their indices an oriented hyperplane , i.e. , an affine hull of codimension @xmath8 together with an orientation .",
    "furthermore , every @xmath9element subset of affine independent points of @xmath4 defines via the ordering of their indices an oriented hyperline , i.e. , an affine hull of codimension 2 together with an orientation of it .",
    "although this affine model can be described further and the concept we are going to describe is useful for affine applications as well , in what follows we prefer to use the notational advantage that occurs when embedding this concept in the usual way in projective space .",
    "first consider a bijective map between our former oriented @xmath7dimensional euclidean space @xmath5 and a non - central oriented hyperplane of the oriented space @xmath10 .",
    "the former points @xmath11 then become non - zero vectors @xmath12 in @xmath10 , @xmath13 , the former oriented hyperplanes become oriented central hyperplanes in @xmath10 , and the former oriented hyperlines , defined via an index set @xmath14 with @xmath15 , become oriented central hyperlines ( subspaces of codimension 2 in @xmath10 together with an orientation ) . for",
    "what follows we can also assume that we have started with an ordered set of vectors @xmath16 in our oriented space @xmath10 that has not necessarily an affine pre - image .",
    "the oriented central hyperline with index set @xmath17 is an @xmath18 , and the restriction of @xmath19 to all elements in that hyperline yields an arrangement @xmath20 of non - zero vectors in @xmath21 .",
    "we rotate an additional central oriented hyperplane in @xmath10 around one of our oriented central hyperlines with index set @xmath17 in the well defined positive sense , i.e. , the ordered set of vectors with index set @xmath17 together with two adjacent consecutive outer normal vectors of the hyperplane form a positive basis of our oriented space @xmath10 .",
    "an orthogonal projection @xmath22 along the oriented hyperline onto its corresponding two - dimensional orthogonal oriented space @xmath23 ( that forms together with the oriented hyperline a positive orientation of the whole space ) shows the image of the additional central oriented hyperplane as a rotating ( mathematically positive ) central oriented line in the plane .",
    "precisely all vectors @xmath12 that are not in the hyperline defined by @xmath17 appear after the projection as non - zero vectors @xmath24 their indices form a periodic circular sequence around the origin when we pursue the incidences of the vectors with the rotating line .",
    "we store the cyclic order of incidences in a cyclic order of sets , where we write an index @xmath25 when the vector @xmath12 is consistent with the orientation of the oriented line , and @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "we refer to this notation as * signed indices*.    when an incidence position , say position @xmath27 , of the rotating oriented line with a vector occurs , we write the signed indices of all vectors that are incident with the oriented line in a set @xmath28 .",
    "note that the period of the cyclic sequence is even , since there are two positions of the rotating oriented line in which it is incident with the vector @xmath29 , corresponding to the signed indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we obtain a well defined oriented circular sequence @xmath30 ( * oriented cycle * ) of sets of signed indices , where after half the period there is a sign reversal for each element .",
    "the combinatorics of the hyperline is encoded in the arrangement @xmath20 with index set @xmath17 together with the oriented circular sequence of incidences with the rotating line , @xmath31 , to which we also refer as a * hyperline*. we obtain a * hyperline sequence * when we write down all hyperlines arising in the vector arrangement .",
    "this model can be generalized in two ways .",
    "the combinatorial abstraction leads on the one hand to oriented matroids characterized as hyperline sequences and on the other hand it leads to topological equivalence classes of arrangements of pseudospheres .",
    "we give a new proof of a one - to - one correspondence of oriented matroids and classes of arrangements of pseudospheres .",
    "we further generalize arrangements of pseudospheres , and we show that one can still read off a hyperline sequence .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we define hyperline sequences as a combinatorial abstraction of vector configurations in section  [ sec : hls ] .",
    "we recall the chirotope concept in section  [ sec : chirotope ] and we show the equivalence of these two concepts in theorem  [ thm : hls - chi ] .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the concepts of deletion and contraction for both settings . we introduce the topological representation of oriented matroids via arrangements of oriented pseudospheres in section  [ sec : psa ] with the corresponding concepts of deletion and contraction . in the proof of theorem  [ thm : cells ] we use the generalized schnflies theorem to show the cell structure of an arrangement of oriented pseudospheres . in theorem",
    "[ thm : psa ] we replace our two axioms for an arrangement of oriented pseudospheres with a single one .",
    "section  [ sec : x(a ) ] deals with the easier part of the main representation theorem : we obtain chirotopes and hyperline sequences from the topological representation .",
    "we complete the proof of the one - to - one correspondence of hyperline sequences with their topological representation by induction .",
    "section  [ sec : flbase ] is devoted to the base case and section  [ sec : flgeneral ] contains the essential part .",
    "we finally discuss in section  [ sec : wild ] the wild arrangement case as an easy supplement of our approach .",
    "the whole proof is based heavily on the ideas that have been worked out already in @xcite by the first and the last two authors in the rank  @xmath0 case .",
    "but the experience with respect to topological arguments of the second author was decisive to arrive at our final version of the proof in the general rank case .",
    "the last section and many improvements of the proof compared with the rank  3 version are due to him .",
    "for instance , the uniform and non - uniform cases form no longer separate parts within the proof .",
    "our aim in this section is to introduce the notion of hyperline sequences .",

    "both in the construction of @xmath533 in section  [ sec : x(a ) ] and in the proof that @xmath533 is indeed a hyperline sequence , we were using induction on the contractions of @xmath400 , based on contractions of rank @xmath8 and @xmath70 . the only topological argument in the induction step",
    "was the use of the jordan  schnflies theorem , that holds also without the assumption of tameness though , in the step from rank @xmath70 to rank @xmath0 .",

    "nevertheless , there are more  arrangements of oriented topological spheres than hyperline sequences , in the sense that there are non - equivalent arrangements @xmath874 and @xmath875 of oriented topological spheres ( for instance , a tame arrangement and a wild arrangement ) with @xmath876 .",
