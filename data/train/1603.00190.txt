    "the field of semiconductor spintronics is rapidly developing nowadays . the idea to combine the well established data processing capabilities of semiconductor electronics with ferromagnetism may lead to new functionalities and low power consumption of devices@xcite . one of the main obstacle for spin injection into a semiconductor is the conductivity mismatch at the interface of the ferromagnetic metal and the semiconductor@xcite .",
    "one way to avoid it is to use a thin insulating layer acting as a tunnel barrier between the two materials .",
    "another approach is to design the spin injecting interface with a similar structure and properties by alloying or doping the semiconductor with a magnetic element .",
    "the intermetallic magnetic mn@xmath0ge@xmath1could provide the desired solution as it grows directly onto ge substrate@xcite , therefore being compatible with existing semiconductor technology .",

    "the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1hexagonal cell contains 10 mn atoms which are arranged in two different sublattices ( mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath7 ) due to different coordination .",
    "inserting carbon atoms into interstitial voids of mn@xmath7 octahedra leads to an increase of t@xmath5 up to 450k , supplying a solution for the room temperature spin injection@xcite .",
    "ab - initio _ calculations indicate that the structural distortions have a small influence on the increased t@xmath5 in mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8(the lattice is compressed compared to pure mn@xmath0ge@xmath1 ) , with the enhanced ferromagnetism attributed to a 90@xmath9 ferromagnetic superexchange mediated by carbon@xcite .",
    "several preparation methods were used to grow mn@xmath0ge@xmath1thin films .",
    "the most common growth method is the solid phase epitaxy which consists in the deposition of mn or mn and c on a ge(111 ) layer followed by an annealing leading to the formation of the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1or mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8films . due to the low mn solubility in ge ,",
    "secondary precipitates or mn - rich regions / clusters frequently appear inside the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1films .",
    "mn atoms also diffuse in the underlying ge(111 ) substrate which deteriorates the interface quality . in this article",
    ", we report on the structural and magnetic properties of thin films c - doped mn@xmath0ge@xmath1epitaxially grown on ge(111 ) by reactive deposition epitaxy ( rde ) at room temperature .",
    "the low growth temperature reduces segregation and allows the formation of thin films of excellent crystalline quality suitable for the determination of various magnetic parameters by fmr : magnetic anisotropy , magnetisation and the _ g_-factor which were quantitatively determined and theirs dependence on carbon content and temperature was identified . from the study of the fmr linewidth , the magnetic relaxation process is investigated and the magnetic relaxation parameters are found .",
    "the main relaxation channels we identify are the intrinsic gilbert damping and the two - magnon scattering .",
    "the intrinsic magnetic damping measured by fmr determines the time scale of the dissipation of magnetic energy into the lattice .",
    "we determine that c - doped mn@xmath0ge@xmath1has a very low damping of spin motions , with an intrinsic gilbert damping constant @xmath4 between 0.005 and 0.01 , which is one of the lowest known value for ferromagnetic mn - based thin - film compounds . in the two - magnon scattering process , the uniform fmr mode ( * * k**=0 ) can scatter to degenerate non - uniform modes ( * * k**@xmath10 0 ) with an effective interaction matrix proportional to the fourier transform of samples inhomogeneities@xcite .",
    "we observe that the role of the scattering centres changes at low temperatures in mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath3where a superposition of twofold and fourfold symmetry dominates and not the usual six - fold as at room temperature .",

    "after repeated flashes at 1020 k and a cooling down at 770 k , a 15 nm thick ge buffer layer was deposited on the ge(111 ) substrates to make sure that the starting surface of the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8thin films growth is of good quality .",
    "the quality of this starting surface was checked _ in - situ _ by rheed .",
    "eventually the sample was cooled down to room temperature ( rt ) .    to form the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8layers we used the reactive deposition epitaxy method@xcite . using this method",
    "the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8layers are created by phase nucleation at the surface of the sample during the epitaxial growth .",
    "no diffusion phenomenon is required for the growth unlike the solid phase epitaxy process which is usually employed to form the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8films on ge(111 ) .",
    "however a good control of the different flows is needed to match the stoichiometry of the desired compound : ge and mn were evaporated using knudsen cells and c atomic flow was obtained thanks to a high purity pyrolytic graphite filament source ( suko ) from mbe - komponenten .",
    "the ge and mn flows were calibrated with a water - cooled quartz crystal microbalance and the c flow was calibrated using the structure transition between the si(001 ) ( 2@xmath121 ) and c(4@xmath124 ) reconstructions which occurs for a c deposited thickness of 0.4 atomic monolayer on si(001 ) surfaces@xcite .",
    "the growth of the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8films was monitored _ in - situ _ by rheed : the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8films growing epitaxially on a ge(111 ) surface exhibit an easily identifiable rheed ( @xmath13)r30@xmath14 pattern which is characteristic of the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1and mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath8compounds@xcite .",

    "we consider here the same type of angular dependence of @xmath41 as in @xcite ( see ( 8) ) .",
    "@xmath41 depends on the nature and shape of the defects that activate the scattering mechanism .",
    "the values for the mn@xmath0ge@xmath1compounds , extracted from the fitting of the linewidth curves , are shown in table  [ table2 ] as a function of temperature . from the calculated value @xmath77=8h@xmath82",

    "these values are only estimates as a precise identification of the defects is difficult to obtain .",
    "as observed from table  [ table2 ] , the other extrinsic contributions to the linewidth have only a small impact on the fitted curves .",
    "the mosaicity is very small , inferior to 0.1@xmath9 , being a testimony of the good quality of our samples .",
    "also the inhomogeneity of the internal fields is almost negligible in the majority of cases , only for mn@xmath0ge@xmath1c@xmath2at room temperature it seems to have a larger influence .",

    "the values of the residual inhomogeneous contribution are generally small , the larger values can also be attributed to a temperature dependent intrinsic contribution as discussed above .",

    "although increasing the mosaicity contribution fits better the peaks , the fitted curve becomes v - shaped between the peaks in total contradiction with the data .",
    "we believe that the mosaicity is small ( 0.05@xmath9 ) and the discrepancy at the critical angle at 300k is due to some other effect ( the fmr line being strongly distorted at this angle ) . we also tried to fit the 300k curve introducing in - plane second and fourth order anisotropy constants ( k@xmath88 and k@xmath89 ) without a better result ( not shown ) .",

    "@xmath105 is expected from the sixfold symmetry .",
    "the in - plane anisotropies are very small as observed form their values in table  [ table1 ] , therefore @xmath106 and the dragging function is very close to unity and neglected .",
    "a change of symmetry of the scattering ( or of the dominant contribution to the scattering ) seems to take place around 200k corresponding to the minimum in figure  [ fig.2 ] . at lower temperature",

    "the two - magnon scattering intensity depends on the direction of the magnetisation in respect to the symmetry axes of the magnetic defects and on the angle between the magnetisation and the crystallographic axes .",
    "one can think that the twofold and fourthfold symmetry can be related to the magnetic symmetry of the defects and to the lattice defect symmetry at low temperature with the defects oriented mostly along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "this is also consistent with the increase in the two - magnon scattering rate ( see table  [ table2 ] and table  [ table3 ] ) at lower temperature and with the variation in the two - magnon linewidth contribution to the total linewidth ( from around 30@xmath66 at 300k to 66@xmath66 at 100k ) .",

    "linewidth a very shallow and wide minimum is observed close to 200 @xmath51 40k .",
