    "the narrow core ( fwhm  @xmath9 ) of the fe  k@xmath0 fluorescent emission , peaking at @xmath1  kev is a common and dominant feature of the x - ray spectrum of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that have a 210  kev x - ray luminosity less than @xmath10 ( e.g. sulentic et al .",

    "the luminosity in the core of the fe  k@xmath0 emission may be comparable to any additional , relativistically - broadened fe  k@xmath0 line emission that may be present , and indeed , in many cases may be the _ only _ component of the fe  k@xmath0 line ( e.g. see guainazzi , bianchi , & doviak 2006 ; nandra et al .",

    "measurement of the properties of the core of the fe  k@xmath0 line in agn is important for two principal reasons .",
    "one is to constrain the physical properties of the large - scale structure in the central engine .",
    "the peak energy of the fe  k@xmath0 line constrains the ionization state of the line - emitting matter , and the width of the line gives kinematic information that can be used to estimate the size and location of the x - ray reprocessor .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe  k@xmath0 line is a function of geometry , column density , covering factor , element abundances , and orientation of the line - emitter .",
    "another reason why spectroscopy of the fe  k@xmath0 line core is important is that it is necessary to model the narrow component of the line in order to deconvolve any relativistically - broadened emission - line component that may be present .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "high energy grating ( heg ; see markert et al .",
    "1995 ) is still unsurpassed in spectral resolution in the fe  k band , which at 6.4  kev is @xmath11  ev , or @xmath12 fwhm .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath13 better than the spectral resolution of x - ray ccd detectors aboard _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku_. although broad fe  k@xmath0 emission lines are better studied with ccd spectrometers ( due to their higher throughput ) , the _ chandra _ heg is well - suited for studying the narrow core of the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "one can then utilize the heg measurements to deconvolve narrow and broad fe  k@xmath0 line components in lower spectral resolution data .    in yp04",
    "the results of a uniform analysis of the properties of the fe  k@xmath0 emission - line core were presented , based on _ chandra _ heg data of a modest sample of fifteen agn .",
    "there are now a larger number of _ chandra _ heg observations for which the data are available , and in the present paper we extend the study of yp04 to include 82 observations of 36 unique agn .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ data ]",
    "we describe the observations and data . in  [ hegspec ]",
    "we describe the methodology and basic spectral - fitting results . in  [ properties ] we discuss the implications of the results for the properties of the core of narrow fe  k@xmath0 emission line in the heg agn sample . in  [ baldwineffect ]",
    "we investigate whether the narrow core of the fe  k@xmath0 line as isolated by the heg , supports the so - called x - ray baldwin effect ( an anti - correlation between the line ew and x - ray luminosity and between the ew and a proxy for the accretion rate ) . in ",
    "[ summary ] we summarize our results and findings .",
    "the _ chandra _ _ hetgs _ ( _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer _ ) consists of two grating assemblies , a high - energy grating ( heg ) and a medium - energy grating ( meg ) , and it is the heg that achieves the highest spectral resolution .",
    "the meg has only half of the spectral resolution of the heg and less effective area in the fe  k band , so our study will focus on the heg data .",
    "our study is based on data from _ chandra _ _ hetgs _ agn observations that were public as of 2008 ,",
    "september 30 , filtering on several criteria .",
    "firstly , we selected non - blazar agn that had @xmath2 .",
    "this actually only omitted one source , pks  2149@xmath14306 ( @xmath15 ) , which is a high - luminosity radio - loud quasar ( see fang et al .",
    "2001 for results from the _ chandra _ grating observations ) .",
    "since the centroid energy of the fe  k@xmath0 line appears at @xmath16  kev , the line would appear at very different places on the instrumental effective area curve for very different values of @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the ew of the fe  k@xmath0 line is smaller by a factor @xmath18 compared to the rest - frame value . therefore , a restriction on the sample redshift also helps to achieve a more homogeneous analysis . next we required that the total counts in the full heg bandpass ( @xmath19  kev ) was @xmath20 , a condition which rejects spectra that have insufficient signal - to - noise ratios for our purpose . relaxing this criterion",
    "would only have admitted two sources , pg  1404@xmath21226 , and 1h  0707@xmath14495 .",
    "we then selected those agn that are known to have x - ray absorbing column densities less than @xmath22 .",
    "the reason for this is that agn with higher column densities have x - ray spectra that are complex and measurements of the properties of even the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line core in such sources can become model - dependent .",
    "indeed , murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 ; hereafter my09 ) showed , using monte carlo simulations of x - ray reprocessing , that inclination - angle and geometrical effects on the ew of the fe  k@xmath0 line become important for column densities greater than @xmath23 .",
    "although the column density out of the line - of - sight could be larger than the line - of - sight column density , it is the simplicity of the observed spectrum that is the driver of the selection .",
    "we will present a study of heavily - absorbed agn observed by the _",
    "heg elsewhere .",
    "our approach in the present paper is to perform a very simple _ empirical _ analysis in order to obtain robust measurements of the basic narrow fe  k@xmath0 line core parameters that are not dependent on details of how the continuum is modeled .",
    "our selection criteria then populate our sample with some sources that are formally classified as type  2 agn , whereas the study of yp04 included strictly only type  1 agn .",
    "we also excluded 15 @xmath24  _ hetgs _ observations of m81 ( @xmath25435 ks exposure ) from the study , as its very low luminosity and accretion rate set it apart from the rest of the bright agn in the sample ( it is most often classified as a liner harboring a low - luminosity agn ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of m81 is only @xmath26 of the eddington luminosity ( young et al .",
    "we note that the results of some _ hetgs _",
    "results for m81 , based on @xmath27  ks exposure time have been presented by young et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who found k - shell emission lines from he - like and h - like fe in addition to the fe  k@xmath0 line at @xmath1  kev .",
    "our final sample consists of 82 observations of 36 unique agn and includes all of the observations in yp04 ( which we re - analyzed for the present paper ) .",
    "we note that our sample includes 3c  273 , which is sometimes classified as a blazar .",
    "however , this source is variable and often shows seyfert - like properties ( e.g. grandi & palumbo 2007 ) .",
    "the _ chandra _ data for the sample were reduced and heg spectra were made as described in yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and yp04 .",
    "we used only the first orders of the grating data ( combining the positive and negative arms ) .",
    "the mean heg count rates ranged from @xmath28 ct / s for the weakest source ( pds 456 ) to @xmath29 for the brightest source ( ic 4329a ) .",
    "the exposure time ranged from @xmath3020 ks to @xmath30172 ks per observation , but was @xmath31 ks for most of the sources .",
    "nineteen sources were observed more than once , and the largest net exposure time from summed data from observations of the same source was @xmath32  ks ( ngc  3783 ) .",
    "the observations , identified by target name , sequence number , and observation i d ( `` obsid '' ) , are listed in table  1 , along with the net exposure times for the spectra .",
    "further details of all of the observations can be found in the _ chandra _ data archive at http://cda.harvard.edu / chaser/. higher - level products , including lightcurves and spectra for each observation can be found in the databases _ hotgas _ ( http://hotgas.pha.jhu.edu ) , and _ tgcat _ ( http://tgcat.mit.edu/ ) . background was not subtracted since it is negligible over the energy range of interest ( e.g. see yaqoob et al .",
    "note that the systematic uncertainty in the heg wavelength scale is @xmath33 ( @xmath34  ev ) at 6.4 kev .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using the spectral - fitting package xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "since we are interested in utilizing the highest possible spectral resolution available , we used spectra binned at @xmath35 , and this amply oversamples the heg resolution ( @xmath36 fwhm ) .",
    "the @xmath37-statistic was used for minimization .",
    "all model parameters will be referred to the source frame .",
    "our method is simply to fit a simple continuum plus gaussian emission - line model over the 27  kev band for each spectrum . above",
    "7  kev the heg effective area rapidly decreases .",
    "we found , as in yp04 , that if the energy band is restricted any further the constraints on the fe  k@xmath0 line parameters do not improve because when the intrinsic line width is free there is degeneracy of the line parameters with the continuum slope . in most cases",
    "a simple power - law continuum was adequate , but for some sources an additional uniform , neutral , absorber component was included ( namely ngc 2110 , mcg -5 - 23 - 16 , ngc 4151 and ngc 5506 ) . in no case was a column density greater than 4.3@xmath38 @xmath39 required .",
    "galactic absorption was not included for any of the sources because such small column densities have little effect above 2  kev .",
    "thus , there were a maximum of six free parameters in the model , namely the power - law slope and its overall normalization , @xmath40 , the column density , @xmath41 , the centroid energy of the gaussian emission - line component , @xmath42 , its flux , @xmath43 , and its width , @xmath44 .",
    "the approach of using an over - simplified continuum model is necessitated by the limited bandpass of the heg data ( @xmath45  kev ) but since we are interested in the narrow core of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line , at the spectral resolution of the heg , this is not restrictive .",
    "obviously , use of such an empirical model means that we should not assign a physical meaning to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra showed a wide range so we followed a systematic , two - step procedure that accounts for this . in the first round of analysis we fixed the emission - line width , @xmath44 , at 1 ev ( corresponding to @xmath46 fwhm at 6.4  kev ) , a value well below the instrument resolution , because the line width could not be constrained in all the data sets . uniformly freezing the line width for all the data sets",
    "then picks up the narrowest , unresolved core component of the emission line for all the data sets . in the second round of analysis we allowed the line width to float .",
    "where multiple observations of a given source were available we constructed and fitted spectra that were averaged over all of the observations , in addition to fitting data from the individual observations .",
    "inter - observation variability will be discussed in  [ lineflux ] .",
    "the results of this first round of analysis are shown in table  1 which shows the derived equivalent width ( ew ) in addition to the other fe  k@xmath0 line parameters .",
    "note that since the models were fitted by first folding through the instrument response before comparing with the data , the derived line parameters _ do not _ need to be corrected for instrumental response .",
    "we do not give the best - fitting values of @xmath40 or @xmath41 in table  1 because the values derived using the simplistic continuum model are not physically meaningful but are simply parameterizations .",
    "the 210  kev continuum fluxes and luminosities shown in table  1 were obtained by extrapolating the best - fitting model up to 10  kev .",
    "we caution that such extrapolation could give inaccurate fluxes and luminosities if the continuum shape is significantly different in the 710  kev band compared to the extrapolated model .",
    "the fluxes are not corrected for absorption , but the luminosities are .",
    "the @xmath47 values shown in table  1 correspond to the decrease in @xmath37 when the narrow , two - parameter emission line was added to the continuum - only model , and is therefore a measure of the significance of the emission line .",
    "we found that in some cases ( fourteen observations of ten sources , plus the summed spectrum of iras  @xmath48 ) the fe  k@xmath0 line centroid energy could not be constrained , and in such cases the centroid energy was fixed at 6.40  kev . in twelve of these data sets the fe  k@xmath0 line was not detected at a confidence level greater than 90% and for these cases only an upper limit on the ew , and line flux , @xmath43 , could be obtained .",
    "two sets of statistical errors are given for the fe  k@xmath0 line parameters in table  1 for each spectral fit .",
    "the first set corresponds to 68% confidence ( @xmath49 , or 0.989 , depending on whether there were two parameters or one parameter free respectively in the gaussian component ) .",
    "these `` 1-@xmath50 '' errors are useful for performing standard statistical analyses on the model parameters . however , as a more conservative measure , the 90% confidence _ range _ ( for the appropriate number of free parameters of the gaussian component ) for each line parameter is also given in table  1 ( values in parentheses ) .",
    "for the 90% confidence ranges @xmath51 and 2.706 for two parameters and one parameter free respectively .",
    "we also found that in some sources that have multiple observations , the fe  k@xmath0 line parameters were sometimes better constrained from some of the individual observations than from the averaged spectra because the latter may contain contributions from data in which the fe  k@xmath0 line was relatively weaker in ew .",
    "detailed interpretation of the results in table  1 will be given in  [ properties ] .",
    "in the second round of spectral fitting we allowed the intrinsic width of the gaussian emission - line component to be a free parameter .",
    "however , in situations when the signal - to - noise ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line is too poor , the gaussian model emission - line component can become very broad as it then begins to model the continuum , resulting in values of the width that are not actually related to the physical width of the emission line .",
    "as a very loose initial criterion , we rejected all cases in which a three - parameter gaussian component was detected with less than 95% confidence ( corresponding to rejecting fits that gave @xmath52 ) .",
    "this rough criterion immediately rejected fits for which the fits actually became unstable and left 26 unique sources and 65 data sets , including 14 spectra averaged over multiple observations .",
    "the results for all of the fits with @xmath53 are shown in table  2 , in which the three - parameter , 68% statistical errors and 90% confidence ranges on the line parameters are given .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 line width is given as a fwhm in @xmath54 rather than the gaussian width , @xmath44 .",
    "the next selection criterion we used was more specifically focussed on determining whether the model width was a measure of the true line width .",
    "owing to the excellent spectral resolution of the heg it is straightforward to determine when the model fwhm is no longer a measure of the fe  k@xmath0 emission - line width by reconciling the spectral data with the confidence contours of @xmath55versus the centroid energy , @xmath56 .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  1 and fig .  2 which show , for a given source , the rest - frame spectra in the fe  k region alongside the confidence contours of @xmath55versus @xmath56 .",
    "we have not shown plots for all the data sets ( spectra for all of the data sets can be found in the databases mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] ) .",
    "for example , we have not shown plots for data sets that have already been presented in yp04 . nor have we shown plots for data sets in which the detection of the fe  k@xmath0 line was marginal or insignificant . fig .",
    "1 shows results for sources that have only one observation whilst fig .",
    "2 shows time - averaged spectra for sources with multiple observations , alongside confidence contours for the individual and time - averaged data .",
    "we see in fig .  1 and fig .  2 that in some cases the 99% confidence contours indicate a range in centroid energy that is clearly much larger than the breadth of the emission - line feature that can be estimated directly from the spectral plots .",
    "for example , for ngc  985 the joint , two - parameter , 99% confidence contour of line intensity versus center energy ( solid line ) is @xmath25600 ev wide .",
    "however , from the spectral plot in the fe k band , the fe  k@xmath0 line clearly has a width less than @xmath57 ev .",
    "thus the 99% confidence bounds on line flux versus line centroid energy imply that the gaussian component is in fact modeling the continuum , resulting in very large fwhm values that are not actually related to the physical width of the emission line . for this case of ngc  985 ,",
    "we constructed a 99% confidence contour ( dotted line in fig .  1 ) of the line intensity versus energy with the gaussian width fixed at 1  ev ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this shows that the centroid energy is constrained to be in the range @xmath25 6.3  6.5 kev , consistent with the physical width of the narrow core in the spectral plot .",
    "thus , by comparing the line intensity versus line energy confidence contours with the spectra we determined that the fwhm constraints deduced from spectral fits for 16 out of the 65 data sets were not reliable indicators of the fe  k@xmath0 line core intrinsic width ( none of the 16 are data sets summed over multiple observations ) .",
    "we found that the situations in which the gaussian width model parameter became an unreliable indicator of the emission - line intrinsic width generally corresponded to a 90% confidence , two - parameter upper limit on the fwhm greater than @xmath59 .",
    "we note that even for the cases where we can obtain a reliable measure of the fe  k@xmath0 line fwhm , the true line width may be less than the fwhm deduced from our simplistic model - fitting because there may be blending from an unresolved compton - shoulder component and/or from several ( low ) ionization states of fe . also , the difference in rest energy of @xmath60  ev of the individual components of the fe  k@xmath0 line ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) may increase the apparent fwhm if the line is modeled with a single gaussian model component .",
    "however , the separation of @xmath61 and @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath63 ( three times less than the heg resolution in the fe  k band ) , and considering the @xmath61:@xmath62 branching ratio of 2:1 , yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that artificial broadening is not a concern for line parameters and signal - to - noise ratio that are typical of the heg observations reported here .    in the present paper",
    "we are concerned only with the fe  k@xmath0 line core centered at @xmath1  kev , and not emission lines from highly ionized species of fe .",
    "nevertheless , overlaid on the spectra in fig .",
    "1 are vertical dashed lines marking the positions of the fe  xxv he - like triplet lines ( the two intercombination lines are shown separately ) , fe  xxvi  ly@xmath0 , fe  i  @xmath64 , and the fe  k - shell threshold absorption - edge energy .",
    "the values adopted for these energies were from nist ( he - like triplet ) ; pike et al . 1996",
    "( fe  xxvi  ly@xmath0 ) ; palmeri et al .",
    "2003 ( fe  i  @xmath64 ) , and verner et al .",
    "1996 ( fe  k edge ) .",
    "emission lines _ and _ absorption lines from highly ionized species of fe have indeed been reported in the literature for some of the same data sets discussed in the present paper ( e.g. see bianchi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we summarize such results from the literature in the appendix for each source as appropriate , including any previous results on the 6.4  kev emission line that are based on the same data that we have employed .",
    "we also give in the appendix any unusual details and/or issues for particular data sets that are pertinent to our analysis of the _ hetgs _ data .",
    "table  3 summarizes various mean quantities from the fe  k@xmath0 line measurements , calculated in two different ways . in the first method we used the measurements from individual observations and in the second method we used measurements that are representative of properties _ per source_. for the latter , in most cases this utilized measurements from spectra averaged over multiple observations where relevant , except for ngc  526 , pg  0834 , 3c  273 , iras  13349@xmath212438 and 3c  382 .",
    "for these five sources the fe  k@xmath0 line was significantly detected in only one observation and combining observations led to looser constraints on the fe  k@xmath0 line parameters , as previously explained in  [ hegspec ] .",
    "thus we used only the one observation for these five sources that showed the best detection of the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "this may bias the results because we do not know if non - detections of the fe  k@xmath0 are due to variability .",
    "we caution that any sample properties derived using our results should take account of such possible biases .",
    "we also caution that the _ chandra _ grating sample is subject to very peculiar and unquantifiable selection effects because of the restrictions on the kind of sources that are suitable for observations with gratings ( or more precisely , which sources proposal review panels judge to be suitable for observations with gratings ) .",
    "thus , the _ chandra _ grating agn archive is not suitable for unbiased population studies .",
    "the principal purpose of the present work is to systematically quantify the spectral parameters from the data .      from our analysis",
    ", we were able to measure the fe  k@xmath0 line centroid energy in 32 out of 36 unique sources for at least one spectrum ( see table  1 and table  2 ) .",
    "table  3 summarizes four different weighted mean line centroid energies .",
    "one pair of measurements was derived from individual observations and the other pair was derived from _ per source _ measurements ( as described above ) .",
    "each mean centroid energy was derived from spectral - fitting results in which the intrinsic line width was fixed ( table  1 ) , and from results in which the intrinsic line width was not fixed in all the spectra ( table  2 ) . here , and hereafter , for the calculation of the weighted mean of any quantity with asymmetric errors , we simply assumed symmetric errors , using the largest 68% confidence error from spectral fitting .",
    "for the line centroid values , 68 out of 82 spectra contributed to the `` per observation '' means , and 32 sources contributed to the `` per source '' means .",
    "it can be seen from table  3 that all four mean line centroid energies are within @xmath65  ev and @xmath66  ev of 6.400  kev ( including statistical bounds ) .",
    "note that the statistical errors on the mean centroid energies are 1  ev or better but they may be biased by the brightest sources and largest exposure times . a more useful measure of the dispersion in the line energies may be gleaned from examining the distribution of energies .",
    "3 shows histograms of the fe  k@xmath0 line centroid energy .",
    "again , we show four histograms : fig .  3(a ) and fig .",
    "3(c ) pertain to `` per observation '' results and fig .",
    "3(b ) and fig .",
    "3(d ) pertain to `` per source '' results .",
    "3(a ) and fig .",
    "3(b ) pertain to fe  k@xmath0 line centroid energies measured with the intrinsic line width fixed ( table  1 ) , and fig .",
    "3(c ) and fig .",
    "3(d ) pertain to results obtained when the intrinsic line width was not fixed in all the observations ( table  2 ) .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines correspond to histograms made from the 68% confidence lower and upper limits on the line centroid energy respectively .",
    "the fits in which the fe  k@xmath0 line width was fixed gave line centroid energies that are more reliable indicators of the peak line energy because the fits with the line width free are more prone to the centroid energy being affected by the shape of the line profile .",
    "all panels show that the histograms are not gaussian but sharply peaked at @xmath1  kev .",
    "there is not a significant difference between the `` per observation '' and `` per source '' distributions , within the statistical errors . for",
    "the `` per observation '' fits with the fe  k@xmath0 line width fixed , we found that @xmath67 of the best - fitting line centroid energies lie in the range 6.386.43  kev , a spread of only 50  ev .",
    "another way of expressing our results is that if we take the highest signal - to - noise measurement for each source ( i.e. utilizing results from the summed spectra only , for sources with multiple observations ) , we find that 21 out of 32 sources ( @xmath68 ) have 68% confidence statistical bounds on the line centroid energy that lie entirely in the range 6.386.43  kev .",
    "a similar procedure also shows that 30 out of 32 sources ( @xmath4 ) have 68% confidence bounds on the line centroid energy that lie entirely in the range 6.356.47  kev .",
    "we note that we might have expected to observe additional peaks in the centroid energy distribution blueward of 6.4  kev due to highly ionized fe .",
    "although such emission lines have been detected in heg data ( e.g. ngc  7314 , yaqoob et al .",
    "2003 ; ngc  7213 , bianchi et al .",
    "2008 ) , the heg effective area is already very small at 6.4  kev ( only @xmath69 ) and drops very rapidly at higher energies .",
    "higher throughput detectors such as those aboard _",
    "xmm - newton _ or _ suzaku _ are more suitable for investigating the frequency of occurence of highly ionized fe emission lines .",
    "we now examine those measurements that deviate significantly from the 6.4  kev peak of the fe  k@xmath0 line centroid energy distribution in fig .",
    "3 . for 3c  273 and 4c  74.26 , we obtained fe  k@xmath0 line centroid energies lower than those for the bulk of the measurements , and we note that even the 90% confidence upper limits were less than 6.4  kev for the fits in which the line width was fixed ( see table  1 ) .",
    "for the fits in which the line width was free , the corresponding upper limits were 6.49  kev and 6.39  kev for 3c  273 and 4c  74.26 respectively ( see table  2 ) .",
    "however , for these two sources , the detection of the fe  k@xmath0 line was marginal : @xmath37 decreased by less than 9.3 when a narrow gaussian was added to a power - law continuum - only model .",
    "thus , the lines were detected with only 99% confidence or less .",
    "such low centroid energies are not unphysical . for example",
    "they could be affected by gravitational redshifts .",
    "we note that a weak broad fe  k@xmath0 line has been detected in 3c 273 by @xmath70 ( page et al .",
    "2004a ) and the 99% confidence contour does not rule a line with a centroid energy in the range @xmath25 6.2 - 6.3 kev .",
    "interestingly , a narrow component of the fe  k@xmath0 line at 6.2  kev , in addition to an fe  k@xmath0 line at @xmath1  kev , has been detected in 4c 74.26 by @xmath70 ( ballantyne & fabian 2005 ) .    for pg  0844@xmath21346",
    ", we obtained a centroid energy for the fe  k@xmath0 line consistent with 6.4  kev from the fits with the line width fixed ( see table  1 ) .",
    "however , allowing the line width to float gave a centroid energy of @xmath71  kev , with a 90% confidence lower limit of 6.42  kev ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the reason for this apparently discrepant behavior is clear from the spectrum of pg  0844@xmath21346 in fig .  1 .",
    "the spectrum shows an emission line centered at @xmath1  kev and this is picked up in the fits for which the line width was fixed ( the measured energy was 6.364@xmath72  kev ) .",

    "when individual sources amongst the 30 are considered , the line centroid energy can constrain the ionization state to be much lower than fe  xvii in some cases . in the remaining 2 sources , 3c  273 and 4c  74.26",
    ", the line centroid energy , including statistical errors , appears to be lower than 6.4  kev , but the detection is marginal in these two sources .       from the spectral - fitting results for which the fe  k@xmath0 line intrinsic width was fixed ( table  1 ) , 33 of the 36 sources have at least one spectrum from which we could measure the ew with a non - zero 90% confidence lower limit and a finite upper limit .",
    "the three sources for which only upper limits on the ew could be obtained were mkn  705 , pds  456 , and iras  18325@xmath145926 . in total , 70 out of 82 of the individual observations in table  1 yielded bounded lower and upper limits on the ew .",
    "we calculated weighted mean ew values in four different ways ( as we did for the line centroid energy in  [ centroidenergy ] ) : i.e. from `` per observation '' and `` per source '' values , each set obtained with the intrinsic line width fixed in all spectral fits ( table  1 ) and with the intrinsic line width free in some of the spectra ( table  2 ) .",
    "the resulting mean ew values are summarized in table  3 .",

    ", the fe  k@xmath0 line ew depends on a number of factors , including geometry , orientation , column density , and covering factor of the line - emitting matter distribution , as well as element abundances .",
    "time delays between variations in the continuum level and the fe  k@xmath0 line flux also affect the ew measured during a given observation .",
    "the sample ew results should therefore be interpreted in terms of a particular geometry .",
    "the relatively small dispersion of the ew distribution that we measure from the heg data translates into a small dispersion in the parameters mentioned above , but it is difficult to uniquely constrain these parameters from the ew distribution due to degeneracy . in the context of the toroidal x - ray reprocessor model of my09 , which subtends a solid angle of @xmath78 at the x - ray source ,",
    "the measured ew distribution is consistent with the my09 model if the mean of the ew distribution corresponds to column densities greater than @xmath79 ( see my09 ) .",

    "the upper bound on the column density is not constrained because , for situations in which the fe  k@xmath0 line is observed for lines of sight that intercept a column density @xmath80 , the ew attains a maximum for an angle - averaged column density of @xmath81 , above which the ew decreases again as the line - emitter becomes compton - thick ( e.g. se my09 ) .",
    "increasing the covering factor of the reprocessor can increase the ew of the fe  k@xmath0 line observed in reflection but there is a trade - off because as the covering factor approaches unity , the projected area of the reflection region decreases and emission - line photons are more prone to being impeded from escaping the medium .",
    "ikeda et al . ( 2009 ) found that the ew is greatest for covering factors factors of @xmath82 but does not exceed @xmath83  ev in their model for cosmic abundances and a power - law photon index of @xmath84 . in principle , the shape and relative magnitude of the fe  k@xmath0 line compton shoulder could determine whether the reprocessor is compton - thin or compton - thick but this is challenging due to the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the data and also requires more sophisticated modeling .",
    "such an investigation will be reported in future work .",
    "so far , all analyses with respect to the compton shoulder and heg agn data have employed _ ad - hoc _ models ( e.g. kaspi et al .",

    "2005 ) so they do not yield a meaningful physical interpretation .",
    "+      the location of the medium responsible for the core of the fe  k@xmath0 emission line can potentially be constrained by the measurements of the line intrinsic width .",
    "the weighted mean fwhm of the fe  k@xmath0 line cores for the 53 individual data sets ( 27 unique sources ) for which it could be measured ( table  2 ) , is @xmath85 .",
    "this includes the two sources ( mrk  290 and 4c  74.26 ) for which the fe  k@xmath0 line fwhm could only be constrained from the summed spectra .",

    "a direct comparison of the fe  k@xmath0 line width with optical blr line widths was not attempted in yp04 because the number of sources with sufficiently high quality fe  k@xmath0 line - width measurements was too small .",
    "nevertheless , nandra ( 2006 ) using the yp04 results , supplemented by a few other heg measurements from the literature , examined the relation between the fwhm of fe  k@xmath0 and @xmath87 .",
    "the results were ambiguous , the data allowing for an origin of the fe  k@xmath0 line anywhere from the blr to parsec - scale distances from the putative central black hole .",
    "moreover , some of the heg measurements for the fe  k@xmath0 line fwhm compiled from the literature were problematic .",
    "for example , for mr  2251@xmath14178 , gibson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported an upper limit on the fe  k@xmath0 line fwhm of @xmath88 and nandra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) erroneously quoted and used as @xmath89 ( gibson et al .",
    "2005 reported a @xmath50 of @xmath89 , not fwhm ) . in our uniform analysis",
    ", we found that the heg data for mr  2251@xmath14178 were so poor that a meaningful upper limit on the fe  k@xmath0 fwhm can not even be measured and therefore we have reported only results for a fit with the line width fixed at well below the heg resolution ( table  1 ) .",
    "a notable example for which a meaningful comparison between the fe  k@xmath0 and @xmath87 line widths has been reported using heg data is ngc  7213 ( bianchi et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this case",
    "the fwhm of both lines are consistent with each other ( @xmath90 ) , implying an origin of the fe  k@xmath0 line in the blr for ngc  7213 .",
    "our sample includes ngc  7213 and our analysis ( see table  2 ) confirms the results of bianchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . utilizing all of the results from our uniform analysis of the heg sample",

    "the next best measurement of the fwhm would be ngc  985 , but we note that its 99% two - parameter confidence contour for fe  k@xmath0 line flux versus fwhm did not close before the gaussian component began to model the continuum . in fig .  5",
    ", points that lie above the dashed line at some level of confidence mean that an origin in the blr of at least part of the fe  k@xmath0 line is not ruled out , but contributions from further out than the blr are not ruled out either ( at the appropriate level of confidence ) .",
    "a larger fwhm for the fe  k@xmath0 line compared to the @xmath87 line could either mean a genuine contribution to the fe  k@xmath0 line from matter closer to the central black hole than the blr , or it could mean that there is a contribution from an unresolved compton shoulder or from part of a broader disk line .",
    "points that lie _ below _ the dashed line in fig .  5 at some level of confidence place stronger constraints on the origin of the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line because in that case",
    ", whatever physical sources of broadening are affecting the fe  k@xmath0 line , it must originate in a region that lies further from the central black hole than blr .",
    "standard tests for assessing the significance of any possible correlation between fwhm(fe  k@xmath0 ) and fwhm(@xmath87 ) , such as the spearman rank correlation coefficient , are problematic because they do not take account of measurement errors on fwhm(fe  k@xmath0 ) , which can be large . assessing the effect of measurement errors on such correlation coefficients",
    "properly requires extensive and realistic simulations of the data _ and _ the spectral - fitting process .",
    "instead , we used the @xmath91 statistic to fit a straight line to the fwhm values of the fe  k@xmath0 and @xmath87 lines .",
    "although we are forced to assume a relationship between the two quantities , any correlation would still manifest itself . in the fitting we explicitly took took into account the statistical errors on the fe  k@xmath0 line widths , using the average of the 68% confidence upper and lower errors .",
    "we found that fwhm(fe  k@xmath0 ) = ( 0.04@xmath92 fwhm(@xmath87 ) + ( 2130@xmath93 ) , with @xmath94 for 21 degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduced @xmath95 value @xmath96 then means that indeed a more complicated model is not warranted .",
    "more importantly , we see that even the @xmath97 errors on the slope include a slope value of zero ( corresponding to the case that all the fwhm values are consistent with a constant , independent of the fwhm of the @xmath87 line ) . therefore , we find no evidence of a correlation between the fe  k@xmath0 and @xmath87 line widths , consistent with the conclusion of nandra et al .",
    ". however , nandra et al . ( 2006 ) interpreted the lack of a correlations in terms of the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line not originating in the blr , but we now know that in some cases this is not true ( e.g. ngc  7213 , bianchi et al .",
    "we shall see below that our results in fact show that the location of the fe  k@xmath0 line emitter relative to the blr appears to be genuinely different from source to source .    from our spectral fits to the subset of heg data with the fe  k@xmath0 line width free ( table  2 ) we constructed joint 68% , 90% , 99% confidence contours of the fe  k@xmath0 line ew versus the _ ratio _ of the fe  k@xmath0 fwhm to the @xmath87 fwhm .",
    "these are shown in fig .  6 and a variety of behavior is displayed",
    ". we found cases in which this fwhm ratio was , at the two - parameter 99% confidence level , was less than 1 ( ngc  3783 , ngc  4151 and ngc  5548 ) , greater than 1 ( mcg  @xmath146 - 30 - 15 ) , or consistent with 1 ( 3c  120 , ngc  2110 , mcg  @xmath145 - 23 - 16 , ngc  3516 , ngc  5506 , mrk  509 , ngc  7213 , and ngc  7469 ) .",
    "thus , it appears that the location of the fe  k@xmath0 line relative to the location of the @xmath87 line - emitting region may be different from source to source . for our limited - sized sample",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 line - emitting region size could be up to a factor @xmath98 larger than the @xmath87 line - emitting region ( ngc  4151  see fig .",
    "we note that the putative parsec - scale obscuring torus that is required by agn unification schemes , and that has always been a strong contender for any fe  k@xmath0 line emission beyond the blr , may be smaller than traditionally thought .",
    "in particular , gaskell , goosmann , & klimek ( 2008 ) argue that there is considerable observational evidence that the blr itself has a toroidal structure , and that there may be no distinct boundary between the blr and the classical parsec - scale torus .",
    "our results from the _ chandra _ heg data do not conflict with such a scenario .    from joint confidence contours of fe  k@xmath0 line intensity versus fwhm",
    "we can determine whether the line is resolved from a given data set if the contour ( at some level of confidence ) does not cross the @xmath99 axis .",
    "we found that at 99% confidence ( two parameters ) , the _ chandra _ heg resolves the narrow component of the fe  k@xmath0 emission in 15 sources , namely , f9 , ngc  2110 , mcg  @xmath145 - 23 - 16 , ngc  3516 , ngc  3783 , ngc  4051 , ngc  4151 , mcg  @xmath146 - 30 - 15 , iras  13349@xmath212438 , ic  4329a , mrk  279 , ngc  5548 , e1821@xmath21643 , ngc  7469 and ngc  7213 .",
    "we do not include pg  0834@xmath21346 here , since the single - gaussian fit with the line width free does not pick up the narrow component at @xmath25 6.4 kev ( see  [ hegspec ] ) .",
    "we caution that in general an emission line that is resolved by the heg may indicate complexity as opposed to a simple , single emission line .",
    "if the fe  k@xmath0 line originates in a matter distribution whose light - crossing time is much greater than the typical timescale of variability of the x - ray continuum , the variability of the line flux will be suppressed .",
    "the line flux may then even be constant ( within statistical errors ) and correspond to some historically - averaged continuum level .",
    "the sources in our heg sample that have multiple observations enable us to investigate the time - dependence of the fe  k@xmath0 line flux .",
    "the spectral resolution of the heg currently allows the best isolation of the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line for the largest sample compared to previous studies . in fig .",

    "in no source did we find evidence for variability of the fe  k@xmath0 line flux at 99% confidence or greater .",
    "however , it is important to note that the 99% confidence regions in some cases cover a large range in line flux due to limited signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , we can say that in our heg sample , the data are consistent with no variability of the fe  k@xmath0 line but more sensitive instrumentation is required to reduce the statistical errors .",
    "the so - called x - ray baldwin effect , a possible anti - correlation between the fe  k@xmath0 line ew and x - ray luminosity , has been discussed at length in the literature ( e.g. iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ; nandra et al .",

    "of the 27 sources , 12 yielded 99% confidence , two - parameter contours of line flux versus fwhm that were good enough to investigate the relation between the width of the fe  k@xmath0 line and the width of the h@xmath7 line ( or br@xmath0 for one of the sources ) .",
    "we found that the ratio of the x - ray to optical line width varies from source to source .",
    "the 99% confidence , two - parameter upper limit lies in the range @xmath123 for the 12 sources .",
    "this means that contributions to the flux of the core of the fe  k@xmath0 line are allowed down to a factor @xmath124 times the radius of the optical blr .",
    "the upper limit on the size of the x - ray line emitter is not constrained because line flux contributions from large , parsec - scale distances could be unresolved by the heg .",
