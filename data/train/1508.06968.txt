    "many - body local one - dimensional stochastic processes have received a lot of attention in both experimental @xcite and especially theoretical research . a special class of models",
    "are those who have conformal invariance as a symmetry .",
    "they have a dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "conformal invariance gives a lot of information about the expected behavior of the system in the finite - size scaling limit ( large sizes and times ) describing the approach to the stationary state ) @xcite .",
    "another important prediction of conformal invariance is about the expected behavior of the correlation functions at criticality .",
    "one takes the size of the system to infinity first and look at the large distance behavior of the correlators next . for equilibrium systems the problem",
    "is well understood but this is not the case for stochastic processes and it is the aim of this paper to clarify it .",
    "we will explain why the generalization to non - equilibrium processes of correlators is not a trivial matter .",
    "when studying one - dimensional equilibrium quantum systems with periodic boundary conditions , one takes average quantities in the ground - state of the system : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a local operator ( in general a primary field ) , @xmath3 is the ground - state wave function of the hamiltonian which gives the time evolution of the system . for simplicity",
    ", one can see the hamiltonian as describing a quantum chain .",
    "the space - time behavior of the correlator for a periodic system is [ eq1.1 ] f(x_1,t_1)f(x_2,t_2 ) = a / r^2x_b , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a critical exponent ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the scaling dimensions ) .",
    "the scaling dimensions are known from the representations of the virasoro algebra which describe the system in the continuum space and time in the finite - size scaling limit .",
    "the space and time define a complex plane or an infinite cylinder of a very large radius . for an open system one considers a half - plane respectively a strip .",
    "the situation is very different in the case of stochastic processes .",
    "we remind the reader that in the continuum time description , the hamiltonian with matrix elements @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is special : the non - diagonal elements @xmath9 are non - negative ( they are the rates for the transitions @xmath11 ) and the diagonal ones are fixed by the non - diagonal ones : @xmath12 . a matrix with this property is called an intensity matrix and we will call the basis in which @xmath13 is an intensity matrix , a stochastic basis .",
    "we stress that a change of basis through a similarity transformation changes in general , the matrix from an intensity matrix to an usual matrix . in the stochastic basis , the bra vector @xmath14 has the property @xmath15 , for any value of @xmath16 .",
    "the time evolution of the system is given by the master equation : [ eq1.2 ] p_a(t ) = -_bh_a , bp_b(t ) .",
    "@xmath17 gives the probability to find the state @xmath18 at the time @xmath19 .",
    "for the stationary state , the probabilities @xmath20 give a ket - vector @xmath21 which is an eigenvector : @xmath22 .",
    "notice that @xmath23 .    to clarify the picture , it is useful to have the following scenario in mind .",
    "assume that one has a non - stochastic basis @xmath24 ( @xmath25 in which @xmath13 is hermitian and describes an integrable quantum chain with local interactions and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also assume that the spectrum of @xmath13 is known and that in the finite - size scaling limit is given by virasoro representations with a central charge @xmath26 ( keep in mind that in a stochastic process the ground - state energy is zero for any system size ) .",
    "any correlator of local operators can be computed in the standard way and one obtains expressions like ( [ eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "if now we make the change of basis to the stochastic one , the spectrum stays unchanged , but the action of the hamiltonian in the stochastic basis is not local anymore but stays periodic .",
    "we will come back to this important point later in the text .",
    "the definition of a correlator in the stationary state is : [ eq1.3 ] ^s g(x_1,t_1)g(x_2,t_2 ) , where @xmath27 is a diagonal operator in the stochastic basis . since @xmath28 is a trivial vector , the expression ( [ eq1.3 ] ) looks more like a form factor than a correlator .    to simplify the problem ,",
    "let us look in the stationary state at space correlators only .",
    "the way to solve the problem can be found in a seminal paper by jacobsen and saleur @xcite .",
    "their interest was to compute some properties of the ground - state wave function of the xxz chain in the context of information theory .",
    "they considered the complex half - plane with @xmath29 on the horizontal and @xmath30 on the vertical axis ( @xmath31 ) . on",
    "the @xmath29-axis one considers two boundary fields @xcite @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and assumes that one has neumann boundary conditions on the @xmath29-axis ( this corresponds to the bra vector @xmath34 in the quantum chain ) .",
    "one makes a conformal transformation of the half - plane to a half - cylinder ( a cylinder with a cut perpendicular to the cylinder axis ) .",
    "the @xmath29-axis is transformed in the circle which cuts the cylinder with a coordinate @xmath35 and the @xmath30-axis is transformed in the @xmath19 ( time ) half axis along the cylinder .",
    "the time @xmath19 evolution of the system is given by the hamiltonian in the stochastic basis .",
    "one assumes that the initial state of the stochastic system is taken at @xmath36 and that the system ends up in the stationary state at @xmath37 ( the circle at the cut ) .",
    "the boundary operators @xmath38 become the observables in the stochastic process and their correlator can be computed using the conformal field results for boundary operators in the half - plane .",
    "since the correlation functions of boundary operators have the critical exponents given by only one virasoro algebra and not two , like for bulk operators , it implies , roughly speaking that the critical exponents seen in stationary states have half the values of those of equilibrium states .    in sec .",
    "2 we extend this observation to the non - periodic open system and to time correlators . to compute the latter , one needs to consider boundary and bulk operators .",
    "we come now to the applications of conformal invariance to stochastic models .",
    "unfortunately very few are known and they are all versions of the raise and peel model @xcite that we discuss in this paper . the model is reviewed in sec .",
    "one starts with the periodic temperley - lieb algebra with the parameter @xmath39 and write the hamiltonian as a sum of its generators .",
    "the algebra has several representations which are considered in the text . in the spin 1/2 representation one",
    "obtains the xxz quantum chain with an anisotropy @xmath40 and twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian is hermitian and its spectrum is massless and given by known representations of the virasoro algebra with a central charge @xmath26 , hence conformal invariant .",
    "the stochastic basis is obtained using other representations of the algebra .",
    "we use three stochastic base .",
    "the first one is the link patterns one , the second is the dyck paths , the third is the particle - vacancy basis .",
    "they are equivalent .",
    "for example , the particle - vacancy representation is obtained taking the slopes of the dyck paths .",
    "a positive slope is a particle , a negative slope is a vacancy . in these representations ,",
    "the hamiltonian acts non locally and it is not obvious to find observables which can be identified with boundary or bulk operators .",
    "although it is relatively easy to find observables having the proper space dependence which can be compared with the predictions of conformal invariance it might be very difficult , if not impossible , to get operators with the proper time dependence .",
    "in other words , it is much easier to identify local boundary operators and much harder to identify bulk operators . to take an example ,",
    "the current density was computed and a conjecture for any lattice size was given in @xcite .",
    "for a given configuration , the current density gets contributions from the action of the generators of the temperley- lieb algebra on all the sites of the system , this makes probably , impossible to look for a proper time dependence which describes a local behavior .",
    "the reason is the following one . in the time interval",
    "@xmath41 which is the time scale for the continuum limit ( sequential updating in monte carlo simulations ) only one generator hits the configuration and not all of them .",
    "another problem is related to the computation of the correlators using monte carlo simulations in the domain @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the system size ) . for the accessible values of @xmath43 , the times are so short that one ends up with results depending on the initial conditions .    in the case of the raise and peel model ,",
    "one could find local operators and their space dependence , looking at the sos ( coulomb gas ) model picture of boundary vertex operators .",
    "this is the topic of sec .",
    "4 . based on the work of @xcite",
    ", we could identify one operator ( called the nca for non - crossing arches ) and the contact point operator .",
    "this identification was possible using the generating function for counting the total number of arches crossing the ends of a segment .",
    "as a by - product of our research , we present a conjecture for the generating function giving the probabilities to have @xmath44 crossings at one end and @xmath45 at the other end of the segment .",
    "we also show , using the particle - vacancy stochastic basis that the particle density operator is also a `` good '' boundary operator .",
    "once the boundary operators have been identified , in sec .",
    "5 we compare the predictions of conformal invariance with the data obtained from monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also show that unlike the nca two - point correlation function , the two - contact point correlation has a simple analytic expression but vanishes in the large @xmath43 limit .",
    "the problems which appear when dealing with non - locality are outlined .    in sec .",
    "6 we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the predictions of conformal field theory for the one and two - point correlation functions seen in the stationary state of a stochastic process .",
    "these predictions will be compared with various correlators in secs .  4 and  5 .",
