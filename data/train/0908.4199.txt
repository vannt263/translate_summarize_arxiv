    "we can conclude that the magnetosphere allows the waves to disperse normally towards the event horizon as well as the outer end of the magnetosphere .",

    "2 .   it does not matter whether the region lies towards the event horizon or towards the outer end of the magnetosphere , the presence of a veselago medium only depends on the rotation of the background .",
    "when we compare the results with the previous literature , we obtain the following :    * on comparing our results with @xcite , only figures 7 and 14 show that energy can be extracted by inflow of negative energy influx . in this work ,",
    "we have obtained figures 15 , 7 , 10 and 20 which show normal dispersion of waves .",
    "this indicates that there are more chances of waves to move towards the outer end of the magnetosphere ( figures 7 , 10 and 20 ) .",
    "consequently there are more chances of the extraction of energy .",
    "* here we obtain clear cut conditions to show that extraction of energy is possible . in @xcite , only inflow of the waves towards the event horizon is possible and their outflow towards the outer end of the magnetosphere is not possible .",
    "thus the exchange of energy from the event horizon with the accreting material was expected to be allowed .",
    "however , here we have obtained clear evidences that the energy can be extracted from the event horizon , passes through the accretion disk and can move towards the outer end of the magnetosphere as given by observational identifications in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this does not negate the work given in @xcite , but generalizes that idea .",
