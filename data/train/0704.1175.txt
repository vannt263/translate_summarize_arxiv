    "the beautiful talk in this workshop by jrgen kurths @xcite ( as well as others dealing to some extent with the subject ) exempts us to introduce the field of synchronization at large .",
    "thus , hereafter we shall restrict our scope to the less explored subfield of the synchronization between continuous systems @xcite  concretely , to non - delayed synchronization between systems of stochastic partial differential equations .",
    "in particular , a topic that has been hardly addressed is the synchronization between noise - sustained structures ( nss ) in systems undergoing a convective instability @xcite .",
    "a _ convectively _ unstable regime is characterized by the fact that local perturbations to the steady state are advected more rapidly than their spreading rate @xcite . when seen in a lagrangian framework ,",
    "the system is unstable ; from an eulerian description , however , perturbations are `` washed out by the flow '' .",
    "macroscopic patterns named _ noise sustained structures _ ( nss ) emerge in this regime if noise is present at all times .",
    "it is through dynamical amplification of random fluctuations that the system is driven out of its linearly unstable steady state towards the state sustaining nss .",
    "thus , if noise ( or any external deterministic forcing ) were not present , nonequilibrium structures could not arise .",
    "in fluid dynamics the nss are a spatial macroscopic manifestation of amplified thermal fluctuations .",
    "nss have been observed in fluid convection experiments ( both in open flow configuration @xcite and taylor  couette flows @xcite ) , and their precursors have been also observed in nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "they have also been numerically shown to exist in optical systems @xcite ( driven in this case by quantum noise ) and recently , in a model autocatalytic chemical reaction  the gray ",
    "scott ( gs ) model  taking place in a differential - flow reactor @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] a brief sketch is made of the gs model , and the rationale and features of the chosen master ",
    "slave coupling are pointed out .",
    "section  [ sec : numsim ] introduces the details of the numerical integration scheme and discusses the features of the nss arising in the uncoupled systems .",
    "section [ sec : sync1 ] is devoted to a fairly thorough numerical characterization of the replication of nss through complete synchronization .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the synchronization measures as functions of the parameters in the model is studied , and a numerical estimation is made of the robustness of the phenomenon . finally , the main conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the gs model proposes three steps for the conversion of the precursor species @xmath2 into the inert product @xmath3 @xmath4 the intermediate step has cubic autocatalytic kinetics .    in the case",
    "we consider , the reaction takes place in a differential - flow reactor where @xmath5 is immobilized , whereas @xmath6 is free to diffuse and is also advected by the flow .",
    "moreover , the reaction is maintained out of equilibrium by keeping the concentration of @xmath2 constant ( @xmath7 ) and that of @xmath3 zero ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "hence , the present model describes the irreversible decay of @xmath2 towards a product @xmath3 that is immediately removed from the reactor .    after scaling concentrations by @xmath9 , time by @xmath10 and length by @xmath11 ,",
    "the rate equations for system 1 read @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for the scaled version of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for that of the fluid velocity @xmath16 .",
    "the real gaussian noise @xmath17 in the rate equation for @xmath18with zero mean , variance @xmath19 , and delta - correlated in space and time ",
    "accounts for fluctuations ( either thermal or in @xmath20 ) .    for @xmath21 ,",
    "the uniform steady state @xmath22 becomes convectively unstable at some @xmath23 , yielding to traveling waves with @xmath24 .",
    "further details are found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "now we assume that system 1 drives another system ( called thereafter system 2 and lying in a second differential - flow reactor ) in a master  slave configuration .",
    "system 2 has the same values of @xmath13 and @xmath15 but its @xmath5component is submitted to a spatiotemporal gaussian white noise @xmath25 with a possibly different noise variance @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28 denotes the strength of the unidirectional _ linear _ coupling between both reactions .",
    "besides being the simplest coupling that enables synchronization , it facilitates an approach to the stability analysis of the synchronization manifold @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict hereafter to the 1d case ( the specificities found in higher spatial dimensions will be published elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : master1 ] ) and ( [ eq : master2 ] ) have been integrated using an euler stochastic scheme in a grid of @xmath29 sample points with a grid space @xmath30 and time step @xmath31 .",
    "the parameters have been chosen as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "for each system , dirichlet bc is assumed at the inlet of the reaction domain [ @xmath35 and neumann bc at the outlet ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the length @xmath37 is chosen in such a way that spatiotemporal patterns develop well before they reach the outlet .    for @xmath38 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : master1])([eq : master2 ] ) describe two uncoupled reactions , identical with regard to the deterministic parameters but submitted to independent spatiotemporal noises which produce non - correlated nss in both systems .",
    "these patterns have been characterized in ref .",
    "@xcite : they are dynamical structures that drift with the flow , disappearing on the right , whereas new wave excitations are continuously regenerated by dynamical amplification of noise .     +   +",
    "when @xmath39 , some correlation is expected between the nss in both systems . a handy measure of correlation for these snapshots",
    "are the deviation fields @xmath40 figures [ fig:1]a and [ fig:1]b are respectively snapshots of typical @xmath18 and @xmath41 profiles .",
    "the deviation fields are also depicted ( in solid lines and in the same scales as @xmath18 , @xmath41 respectively ) in figs .  [ fig:1]a and [ fig:1]b .",
    "the result is surprising , given that system 2 is also submitted to an independent spatiotemporal noise source : in the scales of figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , _ system 2 synchronizes completely to system 1_. in other words , an effective replication of the nss arising in the first reactor takes place at the second one , and time evolution  even under the influence of noise  does not spoil the high degree of synchronization .",
    "if we regard the system s evolution as a succession of snapshots like those of figs .  [ fig:1 ] , natural quantifiers for this phenomenon ( as functions of @xmath42 ) are the variances of @xmath43 and @xmath44 : @xmath45\\,dx},\\nonumber\\\\ \\sigma_\\beta(t)&\\equiv&\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{l}\\int_0^l [ \\beta^2(x , t)-\\langle\\beta\\rangle^2]\\,dx},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 stands for @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively ) , and the global synchronization error @xmath48\\,dx}.\\ ] ]    figure [ fig:2 ] is a plot of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 vs @xmath28 for typical realizations ( as stated before , the time evolution preserves the degree of synchrony ) . in the numerical simulation ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 remain below @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 and basically @xmath49 accumulates the information of both variances . on the other hand ,",
    "correlations between the nss remain during time evolution above @xmath56 , indicating a very high degree of structure replication . in other words , the coupling in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : master2 ] ) synchronizes the whole stochastic processes .",
    "a dependence of @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( and thus of @xmath49 ) on the noise intensity @xmath26 is to be expected .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows ( here @xmath57 ) that this is indeed the case , and maximum synchronization corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , only in system 1 does the noise play a constructive role ( by pushing the system out of its unstable steady state ) .",
    "+     +    as usual , the synchronization between the stochastic fields @xmath18 and @xmath59 ( resp .",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath60 ) can also be viewed in the corresponding phase planes . as an illustration ,",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows the dynamical correlation between @xmath41 and @xmath60 during the complete time history of a numerical simulation .",
    "+    one might wonder whether the proposed coupling is general enough , or whether the reported phenomenon is robust . to elucidate ( at least partially ) on these questions ,",
    "we have performed numerical experiments where the coupling is switched on only after two well - developed and independent nss are formed in each reactor .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the synchronization error decreases as soon as the coupling is switched on , a replication of system 1 s nss takes place after a transient , regardless of the initial condition on reactor 2 . in particular",
    ", there is no need to stabilize the second reactor prior to synchronizing it with the first one .",
    "this fact shows explicitly the robustness of the observed phenomenon , and suggests that the attraction basin of the synchronization manifold ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) is large enough .",
    "+    in the same way , if the coupling is only switched on in a part of the reactors , numerical simulations ( not shown ) indicate that ( even for @xmath58 ) a replication of the `` master structure '' takes place in the coupled region of the slave system , opening the possibility of local replication ( see below ) .",
    "we have also explored the synchronization of deterministic non - equilibrium structures ( i.e , no noise in both systems ) . in particular ,",
    "we have considered two cases of pattern generation : ( a ) structures generated by the time evolution of an inhomogeneous initial condition ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) ; and ( b ) structures generated by an oscillatory external forcing ( fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the numerical results ( discused in the captions ) clearly confirm the robustness of the proposed mechanism of synchronization .",
    "by coupling unidirectionally ( but otherwise linearly ) corresponding points of two samples of the convectively unstable system under study , complete synchronization of macroscopic structures has been achieved , both for deterministic and stochastic dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] suggests that the synchronization attractor is very extended and a full replication of the structures is to be expected under very general conditions .",
    "this is a strong indication that the synchronization manifold ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) is at least linearly stable .",
    "a complete stability analysis of the synchronization manifold will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we remark that the coupling synchronizes completely both systems ( after a transient ) regardless of the initial condition in the `` slave '' system .",
    "even more , the coupling may be defined in part of the system s extension .",
    "thus , for @xmath58 , a ( synchronized ) structure arises in the slave system _ because _ of the coupling .",
    "we expect the phenomenon to have technological applications in the control of differential - flow chemical reactors , and eventually in the case where the convective structures in the master system are not noise - sustained ones , but carry useful information .",
