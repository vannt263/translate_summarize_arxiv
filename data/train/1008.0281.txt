    "the sine - gordon model and its phase diagram has received a considerable interest these last decades due to its unique properties . in the euclidean spacetime ,",
    "its lagrangian reads : [ bare ] =(_)^2+u cos ( )    most of our knowledge has been established in two dimensions .",
    "it is has been shown perturbatively -for @xmath2- to exhibit two phases separated by a kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite .",
    "the spontaneously broken periodicity phase for @xmath3 with asymptotic freedom and a non - renormalizable one for @xmath4 separated by the coleman frequency @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the spontaneously broken phase is of major interest as it has been demonstrated to be equivalent to the neutral sector of the massive thirring model at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite . at the partition function level",
    ", the sine - gordon model can also be mapped onto the neutral coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "the sine - gordon model has also been demonstrated to be dual to the @xmath6 model in the villain approximation @xcite for vanishing vortex fugacity @xcite . and",
    "finally its @xmath7-matrix has been exactly computed in @xcite as well as the @xmath7-matrix for its solitons @xcite .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "the mapping at the partition function level between sine - gordon and the coulomb gas still holds as well as its relation to the non - linear sigma model in the small explicit breaking limit @xcite but little is known on these models , especially in the ir of their broken phase where non - perturbative techniques use is mandatory @xcite .",
    "in addition to the previous relations with other models , the sine - gordon model is also the simplest non - trivial theory with a field compact variable , a feature shared with non - abelian gauge theories . in particular , it is believed to be an effective theory for the deconfinement transition of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological viability of this approach will be fully addressed in another paper @xcite . in any case",
    ", it is also commonly accepted that the computation of the effective potential for the polyakov - loop requires the study of periodic scalar field theories , see e. g. @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that direct studies of yang - mills theories using functional methods made recently major breakthrough , e. g. @xcite .",
    "we will show below that our findings comfort these approaches .",
    "let us now briefly introduce the challenges encountered when studying the broken phase of the sine - gordon model .",
    "while the uv of the broken phase is well under control being perturbatively renormalizable , the negativity of the @xmath9-function for the amplitude of the model tells us that the ir will be strongly coupled , making the use of non - perturbative techniques such as functional renormalization mandatory ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "this feature has been studied using functional renormalization group in @xmath0 @xcite where a possible singularity related to the convexity limit of the functional flows tends to appear in the ir .",
    "this same feature was also conjectured in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the methodology of these studies consists in following the flow for the fourier coefficients of the effective action , thus implicitly assuming that the relevance classification in the uv with respect to the coleman fixed point still holds at least partially in the ir .",
    "we will detail why this assumption is incorrect in @xmath0 due to the appareance of novel fixed points that can not be found using fourier series , in agreement with previous findings @xcite .",
    "the possible instability of the flow in @xmath11 will also be shown to be a genuine one and thus of a different nature .    while we believe that the non - pertubative behavior of the sine - gordon model at lpa is now fully understood with the new results provided here , the inclusion of the wave function renormalization beyond the inclusion of a field - independent anomalous dimension @xcite at the non - perturbative level is still missing .",
    "this point is obviously of crucial importance in the case the sine - gordon model as one expects a non - trivial anomalous dimension to yield the kosterlitz - thouless cross - over already at the perturbative level .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that the effective average action ( eea ) approach @xcite which allows to define properly the next to leading order in the gradient expansion is based on the addition of a regulator that breaks explicitly the periodicity . as a result ,",
    "the use of this rg scheme is non - trivial and some justifications have to be worked out in the case of the sine - gordon model . on the other hand , the rg scheme of wegner - houghton ( wh ) @xcite does not suffer from this plague as the fluctuations are computed explicitly with a loop expansion for some small parameter ( see below ) .",
    "its sharp cut - off nature does not allow the consistent definition of the wave - function renormalization but can provide at lpa reliable results that could be used as a reference for the eea computations .      as a result from the previous considerations",
    ", we will adopt the following strategy .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce wh - rg and briefly discuss the main properties of its flow equation .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath0 and point out the relevant quantities that characterize the flow as one expects the effective potential to be both convex and periodic at k=0 i. e. constant in both phases .",
    "we study perturbatively the location of the phase boundary and show the presence of a continuum of non - perturbative fixed points in the ir of the broken phase previously found in @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the convergence property of the fourier representation of the potential and show that only a global - non - fourier - expanded numerical treatment can describe accurately the broken phase and prevent the appearance of singularities in the ir flow .",
    "the set of fixed points , which stabilizes the loop expansion and ensures a safe convex limit for @xmath12 is then shown to be reached independently of the bare coupling @xmath13 .",
    "we also extend the validity of the phase boundary to strongly coupled bare theories and demonstrate that the renormalized potential depends only on @xmath9 .    in the section iii",
    ", we derive the average action flow equation and project it on the lpa in @xmath0 .",
    "the evolution equation for the potential is then discussed and the impact of the regulator on the location of the perturbatively - established phase boundary is discussed .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that all the regulators provide the same phase boundary . the fourier series convergence is also discussed and is shown to be even worse than in wh s case . it is then shown that for various regulators , all the features found in the previous section still hold .    in section iv",
    ", we introduce the main features of the sine - gordon model in @xmath14 .",
    "the uv perturbative scaling regime is exhibited and the phase diagram is discussed .",
    "the ir fixed points found in @xmath0 are shown to diseapear and a fundamental instability of the flow in the ir for @xmath11 is emphasized to be a genuine property .",
    "we then discuss the use of the average action and provide the analytical expressions that characterize the flow for various regulators .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section v.    to summarise , the present paper is adressing the following issues :    how the flow behaves in the deep ir of the broken phase and in particular how the minimum selection is dynamically performed by the coarse graining .    how the perturbatively well - established phase boundary depends on the bare coupling @xmath13 .    how the convexity of the effective potential is realized by the quantum fluctuations and the stability of the corresponding trajectories .",
    "how universal are the trajectories in the deep ir .",
    "how the addition of the regulator influences the previous results at lpa , as a preliminary step before the study of the wave function renormalization .",
    "how the situation is changed in dimensions different than 2 .",
    "let us start with a bare action defined at the uv cut - off @xmath15 : s_k[]=d^d xwhere the field configurations @xmath16 have non - zero components only in the momentum - sphere of radius @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in the effective theory for the low - frequency modes @xmath17 which have momentum components only in the sphere of radius @xmath18 once the fast modes @xmath19 carrying modes in the shell @xmath20 $ ] have been integrated out . splitting the original field into its low and fast components @xmath21 and performing",
    "a one - loop expansion for the fast mode @xmath22 yields : [ wh_action ] k = s_k[]-s_k[+_0]-trlog()+o ( ) where the @xmath23 holds for a trace in the momentum space on a shell of @xmath20 $ ] and is thus proportional to @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the saddle - point .",
    "the blocked action described by the previous flow equation can easily be proven to be the effective action , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the presence of the saddle point @xmath25 in the flow equation opens the possibility to have tree - level renormalization @xcite .",
    "this happens in particular in the ir of the broken phase for a @xmath26 scalar field theory in the internal region between the two minima where tree - level effects provide the convexity of the effective potential taking into account inhomogeneous field configurations .",
    "let us mention that even if this effect helps us to obtain a convex potential for @xmath27 , this solution corresponds to a singularity of the flow equation with loop - evolution when the saddle - point is assumed to be trivial @xcite .",
    "such a tree - level has been expected to occur in a similar fashion in the broken phase of sine - gordon model in d=2 @xcite and in @xmath10 @xcite in the concave regions using fourier decomposition of the effective potential .",
    "we will show in the following that it is not the case for at least a part of the broken phase in @xmath0 , the whole ir trajectories being beyond our numerical capacities .",
    "finally , let us mention that the flow equation ( [ wh_action ] ) for the action is so far a one - loop approximation . at this point",
    ", one can notice that the higher loops terms that have been neglected carry at least two momentum integrals , each of them being proportional to @xmath24 so that in the exact differential limit @xmath28 , the flow equation ( [ wh_action ] ) turns out to be exact . as the functional determinant is of little use for practical purpose and is in general unknown for an arbitrary background field @xmath29 , one defines the wegner - houghton equation to be the projection of the evolution equation for the action on a constant background . as the blocking on sharp regions of the momentum space prevents us to define the next to leading order in the gradient expansion , see e. g. @xcite , the lpa is the only order of the gradient expansion that makes sense .",
    "the flow equation for the potential reads : [ wh_dimfull ] = -log(1 + ) where @xmath30 is a geometrical factor given by : k_d= the equation ( [ wh_dimfull ] ) holds as long as the curvature of the action at lpa is strictly positive in order to maintain the validity of the loop - expansion .",
    "the limit of applicability / reliability of this equation thus reads : [ wh_convexity ] 1+()=0 where @xmath31 and will be referred to as the convexity limit of the blocked action in the following .        as we are looking for fixed points in the uv ,",
    "let us define the flow equation for the dimensionless potential @xmath32 in @xmath0 : [ wh_dimless ] k+2=- log ( 1 +  ) where we can make the confusion between the dimensionless and dimensionfull quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 due to a trivial scaling dimension .",
    "the coleman fixed point is defined to be a perturbative uv fixed point for a periodic potential when no wave - function renormalization is taken into account . taking the bare potential : _ = _",
    "cos(),_^2<<1 , and linearizing the flow equation ( [ wh_dimless ] ) , one gets : [ flow_lin_wh ] 4k++8=0 where we neglected higher powers of @xmath35 .",
    "this shows that the coleman fixed point is characterized by the critical frequency : [ coleman_wh ] _",
    "c= which reproduces the well - known result @xcite .    defining @xmath36 ,",
    "the uv behavior in the weak coupling regime is easily established : [ wh_coupling ] k=2_k=2_k(_r^2 - 1 ) as a result , one expects that for @xmath37 the periodicity is unbroken due to vanishing of the dimensionless coupling with the flow while in the broken phase @xmath38 the dimensionless coupling increases with the flow i. e. it exhibits uv asymptotic freedom .",
    "taking into account that the flow generates during the blocking higher frequency modes , it is straightforward to check that the critical frequency for the higher fourier modes @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 within this linearization @xcite so that when @xmath41 , the fourier mode of frequency @xmath42 is marginal .    on the contrary , in both phases ,",
    "the dimensionfull coupling vanishes : k=2u_k_r^2>0 this is the signal that one expects a dimensionfull effective potential to be a constant in both phases being the only function periodic and convex . we conclude that the dimensionfull quantities are not good quantities to characterize the theory .",
    "as the scale is decreased in the broken phase , one expects at some point that our approximation of small coupling regime breaks down .",
    "the upper bound of the dimensionless coupling is given by @xmath43 which corresponds to the appearance of soft modes with a single harmonic ansatz .",
    "indeed , in such a case , the flow equation ( [ wh_dimless ] ) is given by : [ wh_soft ] k+2=- log ( 1-^2cos ( ) ) where soft modes have appeared in the logarithm every @xmath44 .",
    "in such a case , the linearization of the flow equation ( [ flow_lin_wh ] ) is not valid anymore and one has to solve the full equation ( [ wh_dimless ] ) .",
    "the resolution for the fourier expansion of the potential for the first 10 harmonics @xcite and references therein showed that the flow in the broken phase seems to drive the potential to be @xmath45 repeated periodically in the concave regions .",
    "this potential corresponds to the limit of applicability of the loop - expansion used to derive the wegner - houghton equation ( [ wh_dimfull ] ) , making this scheme of renormalization questionable in such situation .",
    "inspired from our previous considerations , one concludes that one should monitor the dimensionless curvature of the action at the middle of the concave regions where the convexity limit ( [ wh_convexity ] ) has the best odds to be violated : [ wh_top ]  _ k(_n)=1+(_n),_n=,nat the perturbative level , this quantity has a @xmath9-function of opposite sign as the one of the sine - gordon amplitude each side of the critical surface i. e. it is uv asymptotically free in the symmetric phase and positive in the broken one : [ curvature_beta ] k_k  _ k(_n)=2 ^ 2_k(1-_r^2 ) in addition , it provides a kind of effective order parameter as :    in the symmetric phase , this goes to 1 as the flow suppresses the coupling .    in the broken phase , this a priori goes to @xmath46 if the system goes unstable in the ir .",
    "this phenomenological order parameter has also the huge advantage to be easily computed in frg , on the contrary to the topological susceptibility that has been demonstrated to be a natural order parameter for periodic theories @xcite .",
    "if we are to make the connection with the su(2 ) deconfinement transition , the curvature of the action has the opposite behavior than the one of the trace of the polyakov loop : in the deconfined phase where the center symmetry is spontaneously broken , the trace of the polyakov - loop is non - zero while it vanishes in the confined phase .",
    "this study has been partially performed already in @xcite but we reproduce here refined results for completeness .",
    "let us first focus on the case where one starts with a perturbative initial condition @xmath47 , i. e. the uv scaling is given by equation ( [ wh_coupling ] ) holds .    ) as a function of the scale @xmath15 for @xmath48 for increasing values of @xmath49 from @xmath50 ( bottom ) to @xmath51 ( top ) by steps of @xmath52 .",

    "they correspond to an highly non - trivial recombination of all the fourier harmonics and thus can not be seen using a fourier truncation of the effective potential .",
    "this point will be further illustrated in section [ wh_fourier ] .",
    "a definite answer for lower frequencies than @xmath55 or larger than @xmath56 is unclear as one faces in the first case a very strong attraction of the convexity limit and a very low speed of the flow in the latter case .",
    "a study of the @xmath9-function for the curvature illustrates well these difficulties , see fig .",
    "[ wh_weak_beta ] .",
    "we identify two different scaling regimes separated by a maximal speed of the flow , corresponding to the competition between the uv coleman scaling and the ir fixed points .",

    "the transition between the two regimes is shallow and the @xmath9-function is not enough suppressed relatively to the uv scaling to draw a clear picture . for @xmath49 below @xmath50 , the large bump in the @xmath9-function signals the strong attraction of the singularity of ( [ wh_convexity ] ) on the flow but",

    "one can identify a power - law decay of the @xmath9-function when reaching the neighborhood of the ir fixed points . ]",

    "it displays the curvature as a function of @xmath29 for different scales .",
    "as it is well known , the spectrum of the broken phase of sine - gordon is made of massive excitations , so that the dimensionless curvature in the convex regions is strongly enhanced as the scale is decreased below their typical mass scale .",
    "this point will be further discussed in section [ sect5 ] . in the same time",

    "the concave regions where the curvature is flat are given by the upside - down parabola @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the minima of the curvature at @xmath61 of fig .",
    "[ wh_curvature_phi ] . ]",
    "since the potential is periodic in the uv and since the equation ( [ wh_dimless ] ) preserves periodicity , one could have expected a fourier series to provide a sensible expansion for the potential and try to limit ourself in following the scale evolution of the couplings of the first fourier components .",
    "then , to ensure that we describe effectively the genuine solution , one could have checked the stability of such truncation when taking into account more harmonics .",
    "this strategy , followed so far in all the studies of sine - gordon model is shown here to be misleading in the ir of the broken phase , in the same fashion as the polynomial expansion is in the broken phase of @xmath26-model @xcite .    for the reasons mentioned previously ,",
    "one solves the flow equation for the second derivative of the potential . in principle , as it is expected to be periodic and continuous , dirichlet theorem should ensure us at least a simple convergence of the fourier serie towards the genuine solution when increasing the number of modes taken into account . in the symmetric phase",
    ", this convergence is expected to be very fast as the lowest frequency is suppressed by the flow and thus has little possibility to generate higher frequency modes which are themselves even more irrelevant .",
    "this is indeed what is found in @xcite and even a single harmonic ansatz for the potential could do the job .    on the contrary ,",
    "the broken phase is more involved .",
    "first , the original lowest frequency is relevant and is enhanced by the flow , generating higher frequencies which may be themselves enhanced by the flow ( if @xmath70 ) but are in any case less irrelevant as in the symmetric case .",
    "in addition , the higher frequency modes have an enhanced weight in the second derivative of the potential , their amplitude being the one of the potential times @xmath71 for the @xmath72-th mode . +",
    "but the largest source of error and the origin of the bad convergence of the fourier expansion comes from a kind of gibbs phenomenon in the concave regions of the potential . to illustrate this ,",

    ", one sees that when the original coupling becomes large enough , it triggers the build up of the higher modes , one after another .",
    "since the sign of their contribution depends on the parity of the modes , the fixed point solution is a finely - tuned competition of all the modes .",
    "this situation is comparable to the broken @xmath26 theory where we know one needs the exact resolution for the effective potential without any polynomial ansatz to recover the maxwell - construction when projecting on the polynomial couplings @xcite .",

    "we showed in the previous section that at least a part of the broken phase was having ir non - perturbative fixed points when the bare theory is chosen to be perturbative .",

    "+ on the other hand , if the initial coupling is really large , the perturbative linearization of the flow ( [ flow_lin_wh ] ) breaks down as non - perturbative effects arise at the cut - off scale and no simple analytical method can locate the phase boundary .",

    "these considerations are illustrated on figure [ wh_flow_lower_amp_pot ] where we show that even when the flow reaches the non - perturbative neighborhood of the instability , it finally goes toward the gaussian fixed point .     and the first fourier harmonic @xmath157 in units of @xmath158 with respect to the scale for different @xmath49 with @xmath159 in @xmath164 .",
    "we see that starting with a small @xmath165 , the trajectory goes in the non - perturbative sector @xmath166 but the ir scaling tends wash out the couplings .",
    "]      let us finally discuss how to adapt the results in dimension @xmath14 when using average action . obviously , one will linearize the flow equation the same way in the uv but the loop - integral makes the evaluation of the prefactor of @xmath167 more involved to establish .",
    "the only change is then the definition of @xmath49 and @xmath168 which are now given respectively for litim , power - law ( @xmath140 ) and exponential ( @xmath169 ) regulators by : [ aa_beta ] _",
    "c^l&=&_c^wh + _ c^p&=&sinc()^1/2_c^wh + _ c^e&=&(b_e^-+1(+))^_c^wh where the exponential regulator is parametrized by : [ aa_exp ] r_e(y)&=&,(a_e , b_e , c_e)(^+*)^2the behaviour of the @xmath168 frequency of different regulators with respect to a change of dimension is summarized in figure [ beta_comp ] .",

    "note the common crossing at @xmath0 . ]",
    "it has been numerically tested that the features obtained by wegner - houghton rg can be qualitatively reproduced , namely the presence of the instability in the ir for @xmath11 and the rebounce driving to the gaussian fp in @xmath162 .",
    "in this paper , we established that at lpa using wegner - houghton rg , the sine - gordon model exhibits a continuous line of non - perturbative ir fixed points in @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that these fixed - points could not be found using fourier expansion , suggesting that the relevance classification around these new fixed - points may not be given by the usual simple uv relevant trigonometric functions .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the fixed points are independent of the bare sine - gordon amplitude and the universality of the @xmath9-functions in the ir has been demonstrated .",
    "the set of fixed points found in the broken phase allowed us to define the critical exponent for the susceptibility in this model @xmath173 for wegner - houghton when fitted for @xmath174 from figure [ litim_phase_summary ] .",
    "obviously , this value of critical exponent is only of little help as it was computed near @xmath175 where the wave - function renormalization effect is expected to be large .",
    "the next order of the gradient expansion will be addressed in another paper @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the ir behavior of a scalar theory in its broken phase is usually driven by a dynamical maxwell - cut to recover the proper convexity property .",
    "its simplest realization is given by the effective potential @xmath176 in the concave regions .",
    "as it has been detailed for both wegner - houghton and average action rg , this approach to convexity is usually identified as a tree - level singularity for the flow equation .",
    "we showed here that in @xmath0 the loop - evolution can mimic this convexity approach consistently , without sending the flow into a singular region where the flow equation does not hold anymore at least in a part of the broken phase @xmath88 , the action being stabilized by ir fixed points . due to the large degenerated sectors of the effective action",
    ", the fourier serie was shown to exhibit a very shallow convergence . in @xmath11 ,",
    "the fourier convergence is obviously still a problem close to the convexity limit . using a global resolution not relying on fourier analysis",
    ", we demonstrated that the ir flow may run into a genuine singularity .",
    "the absence of stabilization mechanism can be explained in two ways .",
    "first , the dimension 2 is a very particular case as it allows to have stable kinks in the broken phase .",
    "these inhomogeneous configurations contributions to the flow may lend some stability to the ir behavior .",
    "the lack of proof of stabilization of the flow for too small @xmath49 can be seen whether as a too weak numerical accuracy whether as the presence of new zero modes : it is known that for low enough @xmath49 , kink bound - states appear in the spectrum .",
    "another possible explanation is the non - vanishing scaling dimension in @xmath14 . in this case , the dimensionless @xmath177 frequency decreasing with the flow for @xmath11 , the size of the concave regions in the space of the dimensionless field configurations is growing as @xmath178 . as a result , this enforces the degeneracy of the action in the corresponding regions when the scale is decreased .",
    "on the opposite , in @xmath162 , the size of the field configuration space where the action is not convex decreases with the flow , and the convexity limit that we could find starting with @xmath179 is expected to be reppelling .      as widely known from semi - classical considerations ,",
    "the broken phase of the sine - gordon model exhibits a mass gap due to kinks and kink bound states .",
    "the set of fixed points found here are clearly incompatible with it as this would mean that the dimensionful curvature around the minima is going to zero when integrating all the fluctuations .",
    "this is the price to pay for the use of lpa : the kink mass which is usually recovered by rg to be an invariant of the perturbative flow with wave function renormalization crucially depends on the kosterlitz - thouless separatrices presence .",
    "nevertheless , we saw that even at lpa , one has some traces of the mass of the excitations : the convex regions were strongly enhanced in the ir before saturating .    as a result",
    ", we can not hope for a global fixed point for the action when including wave - function renormalization non - perturbatively , as the convex regions are expected to exhibit a mass gap .",
    "another aspect of the present study was to clarify the impact of the regulator when using average action as its introduction breaks periodicity .",
    "it was shown that for any regulator , the phase boundary does not change in @xmath0 .",
    "focusing on the broken phase , we exhibited a similar set of fixed points in the ir that have been shown to be bare - amplitude independent for various regulators .",
    "this feature showed that even if the regulator changes quantitatively the broken phase -the critical exponent is @xmath180 from the fit for @xmath181 using litim regulator- it allows to reproduce the main features qualitatively .",
    "in other dimensions , even if the frequency @xmath168 is different as the one in wegner - houghton , one can demonstrate that the results are the same provided the use of the relative frequency @xmath49 .    in @xmath0 ,",
    "as the broken phase appeared to be involved , being the product of a fine balance between convex and concave regions of the potential to stabilize the potential above the flow singularity , it can also be seen as an ideal testing ground for approximate rg schemes , namely proper - time . in @xcite",
    ", proper - time flows where used to study the broken phase of @xmath26 model where it was argued that there was no conceptual problem in reaching the limit @xmath150 .",
    "it would be interesting to check if the fixed - points are still present , preventing the appearance of a singularity in the flow and if the convex region is always well - behaved .",
    "clearly , for the `` exponential case '' of proper - time , that was found to optimize the computation of critical exponents in @xcite , there is little hope to find the fixed points being found here at a finite distance of the convexity limit that is in this case rejected at @xmath150 .",
    "as mentionned in the introduction , the average action has been extensively used to study yang - mills theories deconfinement transition . due to the presence of the regulator breaking gauge invariance",
    ", one can use e. g. modified ward identities to wash out its effects @xcite .",
    "the problem of such process is that the center symmetry breakdown that is monitored to study deconfinement is clearly unconstrained by such procedure , being a discrete symmetry .",
    "our present finding that the addition of a regulator is qualitatively priceless is the case of the sine - gordon discrete periodicity symmetry breaking conforts the use of this approach .      finally , even simple perturbative considerations allowed us to demonstrate that starting with a perturbative sine - gordon model always drives us in the broken phase for @xmath11 .",
    "the absence of a symmetric phase at lpa order is not really good news if we are to mimic @xmath8 with the sine - gordon model , as it would correspond to the absence of a confining phase .",
    "this pushes us to conclude that the haaron gas is more involved than a simple perturbative sine - gordon and that the higher order harmonics dropped for simplicity in @xcite have to be taken into account in @xmath11 due to the absence of coleman fixed point needed to use universality argument on the first harmonics . in @xmath162 ,",
    "the symmetry seems to be always preserved , reflecting the fact that @xmath0 is the lower critical dimension .    in any case , we saw that the main features in @xmath14 are driven by the scaling dimension of the field so that these conclusions can perfectly be not representative of the genuine behavior when wave - function renormalization is taken into account , especially in the non - perturbative sectors .",
    "the author wishes to thank j. polonyi for many fruitful discussions and j. p. blaizot , b. delamotte and d. mouhanna for their constructive suggestions in the improvement of the manuscript .",
    "the author is also grateful to b. friman , v. skokov and s. nagy for many useful advices .",
    "the numerical study of flow equations is in general an involved problem as we study a strongly non - linear partial differential equation ( pde ) or an integro - partial differential equation ( ipde ) when the loop - integral is analytically intractable .",
    "many studies made the use of the algorithm of @xcite using finite differences in a grid of @xmath29 .",
    "this method has been shown to be very powerful , especially in computing critical exponents @xcite .",
    "we made use in the present study of the algorithm developed by berzins and dew @xcite , @xcite and @xcite known as @xmath183 collocation method .",
    "the main reason is because it is much faster when dealing with a very fine dependence on @xmath29 as meshes of @xmath184 points can be computed on a laptop within a reasonable amount of time .",
    "it has been shown to reproduce accurately the analytical results @xcite for the wilson - fixed point potential in @xmath185 in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm relies on two different parts .",
    "the first one , the most important in our case , is the discretization of the field dependence using spline representation i.e. chebyshev piecewise polynomials e. g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this parameterization exhibits a very fast convergence with respect to two parameters : the degree of the polynomials chosen on each sub - interval and the number of sub - intervals into which the field interval is spitted into .",
    "+ due to the finiteness of the range of @xmath29 for which the flow equation is solved , two boundary conditions are needed . in the special case of sine - gordon model",
    ", we constrained the first derivative of the curvature to vanish in @xmath186 due to the manifest @xmath187-invariance of the problem . as we solved the flow on an integer number of periods @xmath44 ,",
    "the other boundary has been chosen to follow the same condition due to periodicity .",
    "even if periodicity was not explicitly encoded in our numerical solution , we found that solving the flow equations over @xmath188 periods were enough to get rid of any finite boundary effect .",
    "+ the field discretization was dealt on @xmath189 sub - intervals , each one containing a chebyshev polynomial of degree @xmath190 . for low @xmath9",
    "-when the points density is smaller- increasing ten times the number of points as been tested to exhibit the same results in wegner - houghton case and with the power - law regulators . in the case of litim regulator",
    ", we tested systematically the numerical stability against an increase of number of points and even when the results slightly changed , it never excessed @xmath191 in relative error .",
    "+ the scale integration is handled by the dassl routine @xcite using backward differentiation formula that is known to be efficient in estimating the scale derivative in stiff cases .",
    "finally , the loop - integrals for the power - law regulator are performed using adaptive gauss - kronrod rules . even if the explicit formulation of the flow equation can be worked out , cf appendix [ app_power ] , we chose to perform numerically the integration .",
    "first because the use of the analytical formulation does not save much computation time due to the appearance of non - trivial functions ( mostly the @xmath192 ) but also because we were not able to compute the explicit shape of the flow equation for other power - law regulators . as we compared the different flows for @xmath141 and @xmath193 , we wanted to have the same degree of accuracy in both cases .",
    "let us also mention that in the case of the sine - gordon model , a fit of the loop integral as a function of the curvature is not a well suited strategy as this function would have to be fitted for the whole range of the possible curvatures . in the concave regions",
    ", we saw that it gets close to an instability while in the convex regions , a very accurate estimate is needed for large curvature values .",
    "let us briefly present the so - called callan - symanzik rg @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the running quantity is not a coarse graining scale but a bare mass and thus the flow equation describes how different bare theories are related through a change of the mass and reads : k_k = tr ( ) where the functional kernel of the right - hand side have been demonstrated to be related to the proper - time flows generators , @xcite . in general",
    ", this flow equation still contains uv ( and ir ) divergences as no explicit regularization has been made .",
    "let us now imagine that we are able to compute the renormalized action for some well - chosen value of @xmath15 .",
    "this flow equation is now nothing than the pde one will have to solve to transport the known renormalized result ( usually perturbative for @xmath15 large enough ) to a region of physical interest ( typically @xmath150 ) .",
    "obviously , this procedure will work provided that a continuous mapping can be made between the bare and the renormalized parameters i.e. provided that no phase boundary were encountered .",
    "let us now apply this equation on the simple ansatz : _",
    "k[]=d^dx where @xmath194 is field independent .",
    "the flow equation for the potential reads : k_kv_k = k_dp^d-1dp that can be derived from the power - law regulator for @xmath195 using average action .",
    "this integral is straightforward computed in @xmath164 as it is well known that no divergences occur in quantum mechanics . in @xmath0 , the integral exhibits a logarithmic divergence that should be subtracted : k_kv_k & = & k_2pdp _ n=0^(-1)^n()^n + & = & -log(1 + ) where the term @xmath196 was dropped being an infinite field -independent constant .",
    "this equation is nothing but the wegner - houghton equation with a field - independent wave function renormalization . at this stage",
    ", one can remember the perturbative proof of @xcite to establish the perturbative renormalization group equations : starting with a massive sine - gordon model , all the computations are well defined and the vanishing mass limit is taken only at the end . so that this procedure can be seen as a perturbative version of callan - symanzyk rg . non - perturbatively , we know this procedure does not meet a singularity on the trajectory as the line of fixed points we established for wegner - houghton holds and protects the evolution . as a result , we believe this provides a non - perturbative proof of the consistency of the approach of @xcite that has to be checked otherwise only order by order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "it also shows that no - phase boundary is encountered when smoothly switching off the mass term in the massive sine - gordon model .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that the flow equation have been safely regularized by the possibility of dropping an infinite contribution to the free - energy that was in our ansatz field - independent .",
    "if we were to take into account a field - dependent wave - function renormalization , it is straightforward to notice that this simple recipe does not apply , not even considering the flow equation for @xmath194 . as a result",
    ", it may be the sign that perturbative renormalization procedure @xcite is lost if we were to study more involved ansatz .",
    "while in general , the loop - integral can not be computed in the flow equation of average action , it is the case for the power - law regulator for @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the first point of interest is that it emphasizes the special role of the quantity @xmath197 as the flow equation has two different analytical expressions that are continuously matching at @xmath198 in every dimension .",
    "the equation ( [ aa_flow_dimless ] ) reads in dimension 2 @xcite : & & k_k + 2 +   & & -log ( ) + & & - + let us emphasize that at @xmath199 , at the junction of the two analytical expressions , this expression is not only continuous in @xmath167 with a common value @xmath200 but also infinitely many differentiable .",
    "this property of smooth transition between the two regions is preserved in the other dimensions as well . in dimension 3 , the flow equation reads : & & k_k + 3-   + & & -k_3   + & & k_3 finally , the situation in dimension 4 is a little more complicated as the flow equation as a superficial divergence in the large momentum limit . however , this divergent term is field - independent and can be safely subtracted as performed in appendix [ app_internal ] . unfortunately , after this subtraction , the remaining can not be recasted easily in terms of elementary functions so that the analytical form of the flow equation is rather given for @xmath201 : & & k_k  + 4 -    + & & - + & & -"
