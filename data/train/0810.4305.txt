    "recent advances in the study of trapped ultra - cold atom gases @xcite have put great emphasis on the key role of two - body interactions in a whole class of physical phenomena driven by particle - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "such systems represent an ideal laboratory for the investigation of many - body physics and the validation of many theoretical predictions . from the theory side ,",
    "a major issue is the complexity of the atom - atom interaction potential , which can be hardly considered in full in theoretical simulations .",
    "on the other hand , very often only the low - energy scattering properties are relevant , which may be accounted for by simple model potentials .",
    "these model potentials may then be easily included e.g. in configuration interaction ( ci ) approaches to the few - body problem .",
    "the ci method displays unique features with respect to other numerical techniques , including an accurate treatment of correlation effects and access to both ground and excited states @xcite .",
    "a most simple and yet useful model potential is the contact potential @xcite , which describes the @xmath1-wave isotropic scattering by means of only one parameter , i.e. , the scattering length @xmath2 .",
    "however , in connection with quantum mechanics the use of pointlike interactions is mathematically troublesome @xcite , as also noticed in studies of bosonic few - body systems @xcite .",
    "the reader may find a brief history of contact potentials in refs .",
    ", to mention just a few .",
    "a brief review of the current applications of contact interactions in the field of ultra - cold atom gases is for example found in the introduction of ref .  .",
    "one major problem is that , in their simple form of dirac @xmath0-functions , contact potentials do not provide any scattering in two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "this problem may be solved by introducing a proper regularization , which slightly enlarges the hilbert space spanned by the possible eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this procedure , however , has subtle drawbacks , which are particularly relevant for the ci approach .",
    "the crux of the matter , as already noted by huang @xcite , lies in the fact that the regularized operators may be non - hermitian , which prohibits finding their eigenvalues by variational methods .",
    "in particular , the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian on a _ complete _ space provides only trivial ( i.e. , non interacting ) solutions @xcite , unless the class of allowed basis wave functions obey special ( and often impractical ) boundary conditions @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we illustrate a rather simple alternative scheme to apply the ci method to the few - body problem with contact interactions . in a truncated hilbert space ,",
    "the coupling constant of the interaction potential is renormalized according to the energy cut - off considered in the calculation .",
    "this relation is established for the example of two particles confined in a two - dimensional harmonic trap , for which the exact regularized solutions are available  @xcite .",
    "we wish to point out that the ci diagonalization must be performed on a truncated hilbert subspace .",
    "in fact , the ground - state energy obtained from the ci solution of the two - body problem has no lower bound as the size of the basis employed in the diagonalization increases .",
    "similar results were already reported by esry and greene @xcite .",
    "after truncation , the ci algorithm may _ correctly _ reproduce the exact energies and wave functions of both ground and excited states , except in a small range of the relative distance between the two particles , close to the origin .",
    "this agreement allows to map the coupling constant of the contact potential employed in the calculation to the two - dimensional scattering length @xmath3 .",
    "this mapping , however , significantly depends on the energy cut - off .    in this paper , a relation between the coupling constant , the energy cut - off , and the scattering length is established , that straightforwardly may be used for ci calculations of few - body systems @xcite . in spirit",
    ", this renormalization procedure is analogous to the ultraviolet renormalization adopted in similar contexts by means of diverse techniques , including space discretization @xcite , dimensional @xcite and momentum - cutoff @xcite regularization , as well as to other approaches @xcite .",

    "[ s : failure ] , we discuss the exact solution of the two - body schrdinger equation in sec .",

    "a simple , yet non - trivial example for investigating the nature of the contact interactions , is that of two interacting particles in a two - dimensional harmonic trap of characteristic frequency @xmath5 . throughout this paper",
    "we use as energy unit @xmath6 and as length unit the oscillator length , @xmath7 .",
    "the two - body hamiltonian , conveniently written in the center - of - mass and relative - motion coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , then reads as @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimensionless coupling constant in units of @xmath14 .",
    "the non - trivial part of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , pertains to the relative motion , while the center - of - mass eigenstates of @xmath17 are simply fock - darwin orbitals in the @xmath18 coordinate .",
    "the former may be solved by expanding the relative - motion wave function on a basis of fock - darwin orbitals  @xcite : @xmath19 here the @xmath20 s are the eigenstates of @xmath16 when @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the number of orbitals employed in the diagonalization . moreover ,",
    "if the relative - motion angular momentum is even ( odd ) , the solution equally holds for spinless bosons and fermions with total spin zero ( one ) . here",
    "we investigate the lowest - energy singlet states of either two spinless bosons or two fermions of opposite spin 1/2 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem consists in the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for the fock - darwin orbital in the @xmath25-space with @xmath26 nodes in the radial direction , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , since the off - diagonal matrix element is zero for @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit orbital form is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the laguerre polynomial of order @xmath26 .",
    "the ground state energy obtained from the numerical diagonalization of matrix ( [ eq : matrix ] ) is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig1a ] and [ fig1b ] as a function of the basis size @xmath22 , for several values of @xmath13 , both for the repulsive ( fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) and attractive ( fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) case . from fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ( and the inset with higher resolution of the energy scale ) it becomes apparent that the energy monotonously decreases as the basis size @xmath22 increases , not indicating any convergence for the basis sizes at hand .",
    "the failure of convergence is dramatically evident for @xmath32 ( note the log - log plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) .",
    "this incapability of reaching convergence over a finite hilbert subspace could be expected also from the fact that the off - diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements are independent from @xmath26 [ eq .  ( [ eq : matrix ] ) ] . considering the case of large interaction strength @xmath33 , the hamiltonian can be approximately written in matrix form as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the identity and @xmath36 is the @xmath37 matrix with all elements equal to one . for large values of @xmath22",
    "the lowest eigenvalue is 1 and @xmath38 for repulsive and attractive interaction , respectively , and it is clearly seen how the ground state energy diverges with @xmath22 for attractive interaction @xcite .",
    "this is also in agreement with the general expectation that the two dimensional dirac @xmath0-function does not provide scattering .",
    "incidentally , we note that in the well behaved one - dimensional case the off - diagonal element is either zero or it decreases with @xmath26 as @xmath39 .",
    "an alternative approach to the solution of the two - body problem consists in introducing a properly regularized contact potential to replace the simple dirac @xmath0-function and then directly solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "this path was successfully followed by busch and coworkers @xcite , whose results we partly recall in this section referencing them as `` exact '' .",
    "later , olshanii and pricoupenko @xcite provided a more general form of the pseudopotential , @xmath40 , which should replace the simple dirac @xmath0-function in @xmath16 , @xmath41_{r \\rightarrow 0^+ } , \\label{eq : regularized}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath3 is the two - dimensional scattering length , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the euler - mascheroni constant . here",
    "we express a few remarks which are relevant to the following application of the ci method .",
    "the eigenstates of the regularized form of the relative - motion hamiltonian , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 are obtained by imposing that the wave functions , @xmath47 , written as a linear superposition of fock - darwin orbitals @xmath48 with unknown coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 must solve the eigenvalue problem @xmath51 the condition ( [ eq : eigenproblem ] ) together with the requirement of normalization allow to analytically determine both the coefficients @xmath49 and the energy @xmath52 , the latter through the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the digamma function of argument @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the wave function is @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the confluent hypergeometric function . for details of the derivation see ref .  .",
    "figure [ evsa ] shows the ground state energy @xmath52 as a function of @xmath3 , as obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : nosbusch ] ) .",
    "we here disregard the lowest - energy solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nosbusch ] ) for @xmath59 , which is actually the true lowest - energy branch of the spectrum ( not shown ) . the neglected branch refers to a deeply bound state whose energy indefinitely decreases as @xmath60 .",
    "the presence of such unusual bound state for repulsive interaction may be understood from the occurence of a pole in the upper plane of the complex wave vector of the scattering amplitude in free space , cf .",
    "refs .   and .",
    "throughout this paper we conventionally refer to the energy branch plotted in fig .",
    "[ evsa ] as the lowest one .",
    "such energy branch continuously evolves from the non - interacting ground state as @xmath3 is varied , allowing for a one - to - one mapping between @xmath52 and @xmath3 which will be extensively used throughout the paper .",
    "the energy @xmath52 on the attractive side of the branch , for @xmath61 , is always smaller than the non - interacting value @xmath62 , which is smoothly reached as @xmath63 . for repulsion ( @xmath64 ) , @xmath52 is larger than the non interacting contribution @xmath62 , approached for @xmath60 .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the interpretation of the scattering length is far from trivial : @xmath3 is always positive and the cross section diverges in the zero - energy limit .",
    "specifically , we may understand the result of fig .",
    "[ evsa ] that @xmath52 approaches the non - interacting limit as @xmath65 , by recalling from scattering theory @xcite that @xmath3 is the value of @xmath66 for which the asymptotic form of the radial wave function @xmath67 first becomes zero . in a short - range",
    "shallow attractive potential in three dimensions , the scattering length is negative for the lowest - energy scattering state , and it changes sign when the state becomes localized as the the depth of the potential increases .",
    "exactly at the threshold depth , at which a bound state first appears , the scattering length diverges .",
    "this explains the resonant behavior of fig .",
    "[ evsa ] ( @xmath65 as @xmath68 ) , since in two dimensions any arbitrarily weak attractive potential admits a bound state with radius exponentially large in the binding energy @xcite . as @xmath3",
    "is decreased on the attractive side , the binding energy becomes stronger ( @xmath52 is reduced ) as well as the typical radius of the bound two - body complex decreases . in free space , there would be no lower bound for the energy @xcite .",
    "the effect of the confinement potential is such that , as the scattering length is further decreased and it becomes comparable to the radius of the trap , @xmath69 , the curve of the energy is folded into a different branch , which is actually the one we neglected . for",
    "further discussion see refs .   and .",
    "the key point in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nosbusch ] ) is that one is not allowed to interchange the limiting procedure contained in the definition ( [ eq : regularized ] ) of @xmath40 , @xmath70 , with the infinite summation appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : infsum ] ) , @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , by doing so , the `` regularizing '' part of the pseudopotential , @xmath72 , provides a null result when applied to each addendum @xmath48 of the sum , which is well behaved at the origin . in this case , the only possible solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nosbusch ] ) is the non - interacting one .",
    "for the same reason , the regularization of @xmath40 is useless if the expansion ( [ eq : infsum ] ) is finite , as it is of course the case for the ci algorithm .",
    "thus , the regularization of the pseudopotential is irrelevant in this case .",
    "equivalently , on any truncated hilbert space , @xmath16 and @xmath45 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hrel ] ) and ( [ eq : hreg ] ) provide the same eigenvalues and eigenstates",
    "after the identification @xmath73    we conclude this section stressing that the physical observables of the two - body problem governed by @xmath45 do not depend on the numerical constant @xmath42 appearing in the explicit form ( [ eq : regularized ] ) of @xmath40 , as it may be straightforwardly checked e.g.  in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nosbusch ] ) .",
    "this fact is also illustrated by the solution of the scattering problem in free space associated to @xmath40 . from appendix [ a : scattering ]",
    "one can see explicitely that the scattering amplitude does not depend on @xmath42 as well as it coincides with the low - energy limit of any short - range potential .",
    "let us now investigate whether it is possible to perform a ci diagonalization in a truncated hilbert space , corresponding to a physically sensible cut - off , in order to obtain results which are nevertheless cutoff - independent . to accomplish this we suggest to employ the degree of freedom associated to the choice of @xmath42 in the expression ( [ eq : gvsl ] ) for @xmath13 in order to renormalize the coupling constant itself .",
    "the physical requirement validating the procedure is that one obtains the same ci energies and wave functions for different values of the energy cut - off , as well as that the ci data compare well with the exact results available for the two - body problem .",
    "ci energies are obtained by performing the diagonalization by fixing the value of the coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "the result depends on the number @xmath22 of orbitals used as a single - particle basis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ evsg ] . by using just one orbital , @xmath74 ,",
    "one recovers the result of perturbation theory at first order in @xmath13 , therefore @xmath52 depends linearly on @xmath13 ( cyan straight line in fig .  [ evsg ] ) . by increasing @xmath22 , @xmath52",
    "is reduced in a non - linear fashion , as it could be expected for a generic variational calculation ( @xmath22 in fig .",

    "the diagonalization does not converge as @xmath22 is increased , one needs to show that the same ci observables may be obtained for different values of @xmath22 .    the first step in this empirical proof of principle",

    "figures [ relative_vs_slater](a ) and ( b ) compare the ci curves , @xmath75 vs @xmath52 , for the two possible choices of the ci bases , either the slater determinants ( green , cyan , red curves ) or the relative - motion fock - darwin orbitals ( blue , magenta , black curves ) , in both cases of repulsive [ @xmath109 , fig .",

    "the ci code donrodrigo @xcite was used for the calculation on the basis of slater determinants .",
    "the conclusion one may draw from the plots is reassuring : while the results for the two bases significantly differ for excessively small sizes [ cf .  the blue and green curves for relative - motion orbitals ( @xmath116 ) and slater determinants ( two energy shells of fock - darwin levels ) , respectively ] , they tend to substantially coincide if the basis size is sufficiently large ( e.g.  @xmath133 or more than four energy shells ) .",
    "besides , a rule of thumb may be stated which connects the two bases : the ci diagonalization allows for essentialy the same results using either the slater - determinant or the relative - motion bases , provided @xmath22 equals the number of energy shells of fock - darwin levels which are filled in to build the slater determinants .",
    "this is seen in figs .",
    "[ relative_vs_slater](a ) and ( b ) , as the curves for the slater - determinant and relative - motion bases if matched according to the rule of thumb tend not only to overlap as the basis sizes increase , but also to present the same dependence from @xmath13 .",

    "[ relative_vs_slater](a ) and [ relative_vs_slater](b ) , corresponding to the increment of the coupling constant @xmath134 .",
    "the above rule of thumb may be explained as follows .",
    "the fact that the number of energy shells of fock - darwin levels must at least equal @xmath22 is a necessary condition .",
    "in fact , the ground - state wave function , which is factorized into @xmath25- and @xmath18-dependent factors in the relative - motion frame , in the slater - determinant space is built as superposition of products of two fock - darwin orbitals which depend on @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "since laguerre polynomials up to order @xmath135 , @xmath136 , span the @xmath25-dependent factor in the relative - motion frame , and because @xmath136 is a polynomial of order @xmath135 in @xmath137 , then the @xmath124- and @xmath125-dependent fock - darwin orbitals must include powers of the radii , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively , at least of order @xmath140 .",
    "by considering only fock - darwin orbitals with zero azimuthal quantum number , @xmath28 , which typically provide the strongest contribution to the singlet ground state @xcite , the above constraint is enforced only if the number of energy shells is not smaller than @xmath22 . with regards to the sufficiency of the rule of thumb",
    ", we note that , as the number of energy shells increases , the neglected high - energy contributions to the sum which gives @xmath132 gradually lose their relevance .",
    "therefore , the usage of the two basis sets becomes essentially equivalent .",
    "note that this same argument holds also for two bosons .    for the sake of completeness , in figs .",
    "[ tablefd](a ) and ( b ) we show the dependence of @xmath52 ( or @xmath3 ) on @xmath13 as computed from a ci diagonalization over a basis of slater determinants .",

    "the final outcome is that the ci diagonalization over a finite basis set provides physical observables whose values do not depend on the energy cut - off of the basis .",
    "this procedure relies on the comparison of both the energy and wave function of two particles obtained by two different sets of data .",
    "the first set is computed by ci diagonalization with an energy cut - off , while the second one by the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for the regularized form of the contact pseudopotential .",

    "we believe this work allows for the application of the ci technique to the few - body problem with contact interactions .",
    "the interaction strength and model space of single - particle orbitals is defined from the investigation of the two - body problem and subsequently used for the @xmath4-body problem ( see ref .  ) .",
    "it is natural to assume that the mapping between coupling constant , scattering length , and size of the hilbert space for two particles , as reported in figs .",
    "[ table](a ) and ( b ) , as well as in figs .  [ tablefd](a ) and ( b ) , remains valid for @xmath123 , since the interaction affects pairs of particles while scattering events concerning three and more particles are rare for sufficiently dilute systems .",

    "we may therefore reasonably assume that our renormalization scheme is sound for @xmath123 , provided that the set of single - particle orbitals is sufficiently large . nevertheless ,",
