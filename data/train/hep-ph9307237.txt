    "in 1970 we learned that experiments at the serpukhov accelerator revealed that the value of the @xmath0-proton total cross section increased with energy .",
    "the hope that this was the crucial experimental hint that would allow us to understand strong interactions soon faded .",
    "predictions for ( at the time ) future accelerators such as the sps and fermilab machines were made using fits with such esoteric parameterizations as imaginary double poles exhibiting our total inability to learn anything from this exciting discovery . in those pre - qcd days some ideas emerged which were just awaiting the discovery of this theory to jump to the forefront . from experimentation@xcite with qed feynman",
    "graphs it was shown how ladders of electron and photon exchanges can be summed to yield a cross section which asymptotically rises as @xmath1 .",
    "others@xcite , in a premature discovery of jets , noticed that strange phenomena occurred at the isr ( large transverse momentum @xmath2 production ) which seemed to affect particle production in average , not just rare , cosmic ray events at much higher energy .",
    "they argued that the rise of the total cross section was just the shadow of the onset of a new mechanism for producing particles .",
    "ever since competing schools have been discussing rising cross section as either a @xmath3-channel or a @xmath4-channel phenomenon . both capitalized on the discovery of qcd and claimed confirmation of their ideas .",
    "conservatively , one has to conclude that 20 years after the discovery of qcd we still do not know why total cross sections grow with energy . extracting the answer to this question from the lagrangian , which has been quantitatively verified by an impressive number and variety of experiments , is , in principle , only a technical problem .",
    "it is , unfortunately , not a straightforward perturbative problem . in the following",
    "i will argue that some kind of qualitative consensus might be emerging despite a wealth of different points of view on what qcd has to say about hadron collisions .",
    "this consensus has become rather striking at the phenomenological level where i will argue that everybody is basically constructing the same framework to accommodate the data with different labels describing almost identical phenomenological structures .",
    "determining the asymptotic behavior of very high energy processes in qed is not a simple bjorken and drell problem .",
    "the @xmath5 diagram for producing electron pairs in photon - photon collisions dominates the @xmath6 diagram above a center - of - mass energy @xmath7  gev ; see fig .",
    "anyone who ever built a calorimeter for particle detection knows that the ( inclusive ) cross section for pair production by photons in matter is dominated by the bethe - heitler process which grows logarithmically with energy even though this process is formally higher order than the compton process . the relevant diagrams are shown in fig  1b .",
    "although the basic reason is the @xmath8 suppression associated with the fermion propagators in the leading order diagrams , it is also useful to think of bethe - heitler as a process of order @xmath9 .",
    "large logarithms associated with pairs can compensate for the additional small coupling constant .",
    "the same argument leads to the well - known result that @xmath10 as well as @xmath11 diagrams form the leading order qcd contributions to heavy quark production . in calculating photon - proton elastic scattering the 6th order process shown in fig .",
    "1c dominates all lower orders in the very high energy limit ! the examples illustrate how the presence of pairs and loops can compensate for powers in @xmath12 when calculating cross sections in the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "the laboratory for studying forward proton - proton scattering in qed is the process @xmath14 .",
    "it should by now not come as a surprise that the first diagram that grows like @xmath15 contains an electron loop and is of 8th order .",
    "each additional loop contributes a power of @xmath15 and in order to obtain a meaningful result one has to sum ( at least ) over all the loops shown in fig .",
    "one finds@xcite , up to logarithmic factors , that @xmath16 with @xmath17 those of us old enough to know the words realize we found a regge - behaved cross section ( power - behavior in @xmath4 ) .",
    "the intercept of the regge pole ( the pomeron ) is @xmath18 and exceeds unity by an amount @xmath19 , reminding us that the electron loops are the origin of the growth of the cross section with energy . for @xmath20",
    "the result is indeed energy independent .",
    "a similar result can be obtained in qcd .",
    "an exchanged gluon plays the role of the box as shown in fig .",
    "2b , and the intercept of the pomeron therefore exceeds unity by an amount proportional to @xmath21  @xcite @xmath22 the good news is that we obtained rising cross sections , the bad news is that power - behaved amplitudes violate unitarity .",
    "this is not a problem .",
    "physicists know a magic recipe to cure any problem of this type : eikonalize .",
    "fig .  2 : ladders of box(gluon exchange ) diagrams dominate the qed(qcd ) cross section .",
    "for the purpose of modifying ( [ sum sigma ] ) into a model which satisfies unitarity we introduce the impact parameter transform of the usual elastic scattering amplitude @xmath23 for proton - proton scattering @xmath24 where @xmath25 , the invariant momentum transfer in the @xmath3-channel .",
    "unitarity requires that @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the transform of the inelastic amplitude , defined following the prescription of eq  ( [ a(s , b ) ] ) .",

    "so , the eikonal for the gluon ladder model is of the form @xmath33 we here assumed an exponential impact parameter distribution of whatever the stuff is that makes up the proton .",
    "the spatial extent of the proton in impact parameter is described by @xmath34 which is the radius of the proton . on a more sophisticated level",
    "this impact parameter distribution can be related to the charge form factor of the proton . substituting ( [ p ] ) in ( [ sigma tot ] ) yields , in the high energy limit , a cross section which is a black disk with a radius which grows logarithmically with energy @xmath35 and @xmath36 in this limit @xmath37 as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma inel]),([sigma tot ] ) .    the new and improved pomeron",

    "reggeized gluons .",
    "a reggeized gluon contains further corrections to the simple ladder discussed previously ; see fig .",
    "the phenomenologist here finds a grab - bag of models .",

    "the knp model@xcite , others isolate subsets of diagrams in order to model forward scattering . in elastic and diffractive scattering",
    "the protons retain their identity , therefore no quantum numbers are exchanged in the @xmath3-channel .",
    "that is the definition of the pomeron , it must therefore have positive charge conjugation and naively corresponds to the exchange of at least 2 gluons .",
    "such a diagram has pathologies at @xmath38 , which can , however , be eliminated by the use of gluon propagators which are regularized at @xmath39 .",
    "such a propagator has , for example , been constructed by cornwall@xcite .",
    "lipatov@xcite introduces the ",
    "reggeized gluon \" , which is essentially gluon exchange with sudakov suppression .",

    "form the lipatov pomeron .",
    "clearly , ladders of three reggeized gluons represent the odderon , an odd charge conjugation contribution to forward scattering which can differentiate the high energy behavior of @xmath41 and @xmath42 forward scattering amplitudes . from the triple reggeized gluon exchange diagram gauron obtains@xcite @xmath43    fig .  3 : structure of the perturbative pomeron ?    finally , it has been argued on phenomenological grounds that pomeron exchange is a simple factorizable structure like photon exchange  just like a photon , but with opposite charge conjugation .",
    "this is the landshoff - donnachie model , which has had impressive phenomenological successes in not just accommodating data , but in actually making predictions@xcite .",
    "the unitarity relation ( [ unitarity ] ) reminds us that elastic scattering can not be understood without understanding inelastic scattering .",
    "elastic scattering is the shadow of particle production and , as previously mentioned , several features of accelerator as well as cosmic ray data suggest that jet production affects the behavior of average interactions at very high energy . at low energies ,",
    "say @xmath44tev , particle production in hadron collisions exhibits feynman scaling , kno scaling holds and transverse momenta are limited .",
    "events with jets are very rare , but qcd predicts that their frequency increases rapidly with energy . at a c.m .",
    "energy of order 1tev the production of jets is no longer a rare phenomenon with @xmath45 jet production begins to affect the properties of minimum - bias events .",
    "feynman scaling is violated , mostly in the central region where jet fragmentation contributes a new source of secondaries . as jets with low @xmath46-values are more frequent , the additional pions are soft and populate the central region . in the kno - distribution a high multiplicity tail associated with high multiplicity jet events becomes apparent .",
    "the @xmath47-value will grow with energy .",
    "most dramatically , as high @xmath46 jet events also have a high multiplicity , a correlation between transverse momentum and multiplicity develops .",
    "contrary to what is expected on the basis of pure kinematics , high @xmath46 events are , on average , also high multiplicity events .",
    "this correlation , first observed by the japan - brazil collaboration in cosmic ray emulsion chambers , has been confirmed by collider experiments@xcite .",
    "evidence on particle interactions at the very highest energies , in fact in or near the ssc energy range , has been collected in exposures of large , high altitude emulsion chambers to the cosmic ray beam .",
    "the most prominent feature of these events is that a large fraction contains  halos \" which appear as spots of extremely high optical density on the x - ray film@xcite .",
    "a most intriguing feature is that the halos in each event are aligned to a remarkable degree .",
    "this bizarre observation might have a most conventional explanation .",
    "halos are electromagnetic showers produced by the most energetic @xmath2 in jets . in a two - jet event",
    "the produced jets and the projectile / target fragments form , by momentum conservation , a plane which will intersect the emulsion thus defining a line along which the fragmentation products of both jets as well as those from the colliding hadrons will line up .",
    "this picture naturally explains the alignment of 3  halos . in accelerator language events with 4  halos",
    "are three - jet events .",
    "it is a fact of qcd that also the additional jet is preferentially produced in the plane of the first two .",
    "this leads to the alignment of 4  halos .",
    "an accelerator physicist would classify these events as mini - jet events . if in a roughly 20% subsample of events jets are visible to the naked eye , it is reasonable to assume that most high energy events are jet events !    because relatively soft partons are the source of the jet phenomena described above , gluons rather than quarks will dominate particle production at very high energy .",
    "the jet cross section is symbolically given by @xmath48 with the gluon structure function @xmath49 of the form @xmath50 the parameter @xmath18 controls the shape of the bremsstrahlung spectrum determining the number of soft gluons with @xmath51 .",
    "the steep soft gluon spectrum controls the behavior of the integral of eq .",
    "( [ sigma jet ] ) in the high energy limit . in the limit where @xmath52 varies slowly with energy , we obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 , a result reminiscent of eq .",
    "( [ sum sigma ] ) .",
    "the impact parameter treatment of the gluons will make the connection between jet production and the total cross section via the unitarity relation ( [ unitarity ] ) @xmath55 the result of eqs .",
    "( [ he limit])([p2 ] ) is identical to the one previoulsy obtained in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) and we recover the same expression for the total cross section , i.e.  eqs .",
    "( [ radius]),([r ] ) , previously obtained by summing gluon exchanges in the @xmath3-channel . in the @xmath4-channel picture the large number of gluons , not large jet cross sections , is the origin of large total cross sections at high energy .",
    "in deriving ( [ he limit ] ) we indeed assumed that @xmath56 is weakly varying with energy .",
    "state of the art @xmath4-channel models treat  partons in hadrons \" using the same optical models developed to describe `` nucleons in nuclei . ''",
    "here , as before , the black disk behavior saturates the froissart bound .",
    "the limiting size @xmath57 mb in the old froissart bound is here replaced by @xmath58 ^ 2 = 0.05$]mb for @xmath59fm and @xmath60 as required by actual fits to total cross section data@xcite .",
    "note that this is not quite compatible with  ( [ j-1 ] ) .",
    "notice that we introduced a cutoff @xmath61 or @xmath62 regulating the soft divergence of the jet cross section .",
    "its physical origin is clear .",
    "jets are produced by the exchange of a colored gluon ; see fig .  4 .",
    "@xmath62 describes the transverse momentum for which its wavelength @xmath63 is such that it begins to  see \" the whole colorless proton rather than its colored constituents .",
    "jet production is switched off .",
    "therefore @xmath62 is inversely proportional to the size of the interacting hadrons @xmath64 this relation implies that the rise of the total cross section for different beams and targets are related .",
    "we will return to this further on .",
    "fig .  4 : jet production by gluon exchange .",
    "the phenomenological textures used by various groups to describe either high energy event structures or forward scattering amplitudes are indeed alarmingly similar .",
    "the words describing them differ .",
    "this is graphically shown in fig .",
    "everybody has a basic building block : a reggeized gluon@xcite , a string@xcite , or a hard collision producing jets@xcite .",
    "these are summed to give a power - behaved amplitude which is subsequently associated with an eikonal in order to guarantee unitarity . the diversity is not all that surprising  if you asked the same phenomenologists how hadrons are produced in @xmath65 interactions they might use different words , as illustrated in fig .  5 , even though in this case everybody agrees on what is going on .",
    "this is not just a cute remark . as a case in point",
    "one can take the phenomenological analyses of forward amplitudes by kopeliovich et al.@xcite and block et al.@xcite , @xmath3-channel and @xmath4-channel  inspired \" qcd respectively , and construct a translation table of the fitted parameters .",
    "this does not mean that the modeller can not get into trouble .",
    "the string model does , a priori , not have the @xmath46-effects that inspire the jet model .",
    "they were subsequently incorporated by allowing hard scattering at the vertices linking the hadrons and the strings .",
    "now the difference with the jet model becomes more subtle because the string can be interpreted as a fragmenting jet ; see fig .",
    "fig .  6 : string or fragmenting jet ?",
    "although all these analyses are qcd - inspired it is fair to say that the models are more  inspired \" than  qcd\"@xcite . even at the level of perturbation theory , the structure of fig .",
    "5 has not been rigorously derived from qcd .",
    "even if such a derivation could be produced , there is no guarantee that the picture is not essentially modified by infrared effects@xcite .",
    "given the lack of theoretical rigor , the critical question is whether the phenomenology is giving us confidence that we are on the right track .",
    "the total cross section does rise , maybe even as @xmath1 although there is no hard evidence for that@xcite .",
    "this debate will undoubtedly resume with the announcement at this conference that cdf measures@xcite a total cross section of @xmath66  mb , in excess of the 1800  gev value suggested by previous measurements shown in fig .",
    "figures  7a , b , c show how the jet model@xcite adequately describes forward scattering .",
    "all schools can produce similar fits .",
    "these do not represent solid evidence for the asymptotic predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ radius]),([r ] ) . the asymptotic gluon term , previously discussed , contributes less than half of the total cross section at the highest collider energy . in order to fit the data it is essential to include  low energy \" contributions which introduce a lot of ambiguity and extra parameters and",
    "can be exploited to accommodate the data .",
    "maybe the most tangible hint for the approach to a black disk behavior is the evidence that the second derivative of the forward slope , which is predicted to be negative , is changing sign near 1800  gev@xcite . at lower energies this curvature is indeed positive .",
    "the @xmath67 parameter at 540  gev is no longer a problem .",
    "the remeasured value is consistent with expectations as can be seen from fig .",
    "the excitement of the last blois meeting is gone .",
    "the models credibility should not be raised by the fact that they could not accommodate the previous large value .",
    "they were just prevented from doing so by the measurements of the total cross section at 1800  gev and analyticity .",
    "eddington warned us not to take an experimental result seriously until it is confirmed by theory . also , the difference between the old and new value is only @xmath68 for an experiment with incredibly challenging systematic problems . in gamma ray astronomy",
    "@xmath69 effects are routinely ignored !",
    "is there an odderon ?",
    "in perturbative qcd there is@xcite , but arguments were presented that it may disappear after infrared effects are taken into account@xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of the difference between the @xmath41 and @xmath70 total cross sections seems not to be in our future .",
    "our only hope is to investigate the dip structure near @xmath71 in the differential cross section .",
    "destructive interference of pomeron and double pomeron exchange is claimed to be the origin of the minimum in the cross section ; see fig .  8 .",
    "now we are told , however , that at high energy there is a dip in @xmath41 , but not in @xmath72 .",
    "so we need a new ingredient to fix this and the odderon just fits because it contributes differently to the two reactions .",
    "interestingly , we heard at this conference that rather large values of the elastic polarization , which we tend to associate with non - asymptotic effects , do not decrease with energy near the structure at @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "this is possibly another hint for the presence of the odderon .",
    "measuring cross sections with different beam and target particles has been a powerful phenomenological tool in the past .",
    "it provided us with early evidence for the quark structure of hadrons via the additive quark model .",
    "it is clear that in most , but maybe not all , models the additive quark model is at best approximate and breaks down at the higher energies where gluons dictate the interactions@xcite .",
    "hera has presented us with the opportunity to perform such a test@xcite by dramatically increasing the energy - reach of the data on the total photoproduction cross section@xcite .",
    "we will here just treat the photon as a @xmath67-meson with 2 quark constituents .",
    "given this additional assumption the photoproduction cross section can be calculated from @xmath41 data in the jet model .",
    "the low energy contributions to both cross sections , which are of quark origin , are related by a factor 3/2 given by the additive quark model .",
    "the rise of the total cross section , which is the shadow of jet production by gluons , can be related using eq .",
    "( [ ptmin ] ) @xmath73 the result of this straightforward exercise@xcite is shown in fig .",

    "a series of talks emphasized progress in putting the qcd counting rules for large angle elastic scattering on a solid theoretical foundation . that the elastic scattering cross section of two protons at right angles falls with energy as a power of energy @xmath77 is one of the most unusual and best tested predictions of qcd@xcite .",
    "the data do , however , show some oscillatory behavior around the power behavior which is associated with soft gluon corrections .",
    "soft gluons are large objects with large geometric cross sections .",
    "hard gluons , on the contrary , are small objects . in doing the large angle elastic scattering experiment on a nuclear target , the nucleus can be thought of as a brick wall filtering out the soft gluons thus supplying a purified view of the true perturbative prediction . the first data in support of this prediction were hotly debated .",
    "a summary talk at this conference must highlight the impressive contributions the zeus and h1 experiments at hera are now making to our endeavors to understand strong interactions .",
    "i already discussed the measurement of the photoproduction cross section .",
    "the cross section is asymptotically dominated by the gluon structure of the photon .",
    "such photonic gluons produce the jets which drive the rise of the cross section in the model discussed ; see fig .",
    "interestingly , the experimental identification of this structure function , reported by both experiments at this conference , is really our first glimpse at the physics that dominates photoproduction at high energy .",
    "indirect evidence for the gluon structure of photons had previously been observed in photon - photon interactions at tristan@xcite . that the high energy proton is a gluonic structure can be best illustrated@xcite by the statement that the new measurements of small-@xmath78 structure functions imply that the packing factor of gluons inside protons is the same as that for nucleons in iron at @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "hera rediscovered , probably to the surprise of the younger generation , that the pomeron exists .",
    "they observe a sample of events with a large rapidity gap between the electroproduced hadrons and the proton ; see fig .",
    "jet production in such events will be studied in future higher luminosity runs thus allowing us to probe the partonic structure of the pomeron .",
    "we were reminded@xcite at this conference of the evidence for a hard partonic component of the pomeron revealed by the production of jets in pomeron - proton collisions at the @xmath81 ; see fig",

    "the pomeron , which is in its simplest form a 2-gluon structure , most likely satisfies neither one .",
    "so , it is not clear how to proceed",

    "there are more questions than answers here and hera will hopefully bring us yet another pleasant surprise .",
    "it is fair to say that the question of why the total cross section rises with energy is not as glamorous as it once was .",

    "definitely not , what is , in fact , more mainstream than the question of how to find the higgs .",
    "the recent experimental as well as theoretical activity surrounding rapidity gaps as a signature for the higgs particle at future colliders has brought  soft physics \" back to center stage ; more about that later .",
    "what about higgs production by pomerons ?",
    "the diagram for producing a higgs in association with two rapidity gaps is shown in fig .",
    "the pair of gluons is in a color singlet , the rapidity gap is allegedly produced because no color is exchanged , and therefore one can also visualize the diagram as in fig .  12b , i.e.  higgs production by pomerons .",

    "12a looks like a @xmath83 qcd correction to higgs production by gluon fusion and contributes indeed at the 1% level .",

    "one should not rule out the possibility of making a fundamental discovery . at this conference",
    "we heard many suggestions ranging from the discovery of the breakdown of forward dispersion relations , possibly associated with additional dimensions in a string theory@xcite , to the observation of chiral condensates@xcite .",
    "chiral condensates are not just an interesting theoretical idea , they may be the explanation for some puzzling phenomena observed in cosmic ray experiments .",
    "this includes centauro events .",
    "let me remind you that the qcd lagrangian for massless quarks is invariant under global isospin and global chiral transformations .",
    "the symmetry is spontaneously broken leading to the interpretation of pions as massless goldstone bosons . as a result quark masses are generated .",
    "the possibility can not be excluded that in a high energy collision a macroscopic , localized region of spacetime exists where chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "imagine indeed that in a head - on collision of protons a significant fraction of the incident momentum is thermalized leading to a hot spot which is in the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "this region cools while the hadronic debris expands outward and , when the hot spot drops below the critical temperature , it undergoes a phase transition to the broken phase .",
    "this vacuum inside the fireball may be disoriented from its external or ambient value as shown in fig .",
    "this orientation may be thought of as a vector in isospin space as shown in fig  13b . in the late stages of the interaction",
    "the two vacua will meet and the inside vacuum will relax or adjust to the orientation of the ambient one by emitting goldstone bosons , i.e.  soft pions . depending on the mismatch",
    "this adjustment will require the emission of mostly charged or mostly neutral soft pions .",
    "the production of a chiral condensate can therefore result in the population of a region of phase space with mostly neutral(charged ) pions . at this conference",
    "we were shown@xcite an event containing a cluster of 32 photons ( from @xmath2 decay ) with only one accompanying charged particle .",
    "copious production of chiral condensates will result in anomalously large charge fluctuations .",
    "the famous centauro / mini - centauro events@xcite can be interpreted just this way and may be a signature of chiral condensates .    finally the physics of the blois workshop is important because future particle physics will be mostly done with hadron colliders .",
    "we have learned from the operation of the present generation of colliders that , whatever the physics under study , in the end some monte carlo generator is needed to deal with backgrounds or the effects of the underlying event .",
    "i have the impression few still realize that pythia , herwig , sybil and the like were not given by god but are based on the physics discussed at this conference .",
    "we have actually come to the rather undesirable situation that the jet model is used in most monte carlo s .",
    "an in - depth study of these ideas , as performed at this conference , is critical and although it might be considered engineering by some , it is essential",
    ". ssc and lhc can not avoid facing the issues we debated .",
    "the value of the total cross section might , in fact , just be the most important physics parameter of the ssc / lhc colliders .",
    "this again is one of these numbers on which almost everybody agrees : 120  mb for the ssc , 105  mb for the lhc .",
    "but then remember that we are all doing essentially the same fits ",
    "the flurry of activity since blois iv on the use of rapidity gaps as a signature for electroweak processes provides us with yet another example of the urgency of understanding minimum - bias physics .",
    "the subject deserves all the attention it has attracted@xcite .",
    "the hope has been raised that rapidity gaps will present us with a much needed opportunity for sharpening the experimental signature of higgs production in hadron collisions . in fig .",
    "14 we contrast an event where a higgs particle is produced by a pair of w s with a minimum bias event .",
    "the different color flow in the events will result in different rapidity distributions of the produced hadrons .",
    "the simplest way to visualize this flow in a minimum - bias event is to think of protons as quark - diquark systems .",
    "the quark triplet color in one hadron is bleached by the antitriplet color of the diquark in the other hadron and vice versa .",
    "two strings are stretched between the colliding particles and their fragmentation uniformly populates the rapidity distribution ; see fig .",
    "14 . events where colorless electroweak particles are exchanged are essentially different in the sense that all color flow is localized near the beam particles , no color is exchanged leaving a gap in rapidity space with no particles ( except for the fragments of the decaying higgs ) between the beam particles . also , jets appear in the fragmentation regions as the result of the recoil of the quarks emitting the weak bosons .",
    "rapidity gaps , well - known to this audience as a signature for colorless pomeron exchange , are here a signature for higgs or electroweak exchange in general .",
    "is this too good to be true ? it is , and here a series of very hard questions must be raised whose answers are intimately connected with the physics discussed at this meeting .",
    "how often do real gaps disappear ? they can be filled by ( coherent ) radiation of particles by the active quarks that emitted the @xmath84 s .",
    "alternatively , particles associated with the underlying event , e.g.additional jet production , can fill the gap .",
    "this is referred to as the survival probability . in the jet model",
    "it is readily computed to be @xmath85 with @xmath86 , i.e.  the probability that no jet production occurs . in fig .",

    ".    how often do fake gaps appear ?",
    "fluctuations in regular events can produce fake gaps .",
    "one might expect that the probability is exponentially suppressed , but in a jet model this is not the case .",
    "fluctuations associated with multiple jet production are more likely . also , are gap events , which are in no way associated with electroweak phenomena , produced by the exchange of a pair of gluons in a color singlet state ?",
    "the answer to this question is far from obvious because the fact that the net color is zero does not imply that the gluons can not radiate into the gap .",
    "the subject has obviously raised more questions than it has answered and in a concerted effort experimentalists and theorists are tackling them .",
    "the experimentalists are using jet production by photon exchange as a laboratory for studying rapidity gap physics .",
    "preliminary data indicate@xcite the observation of gaps .",
    "the @xmath87 to @xmath88 observation rate is consistent with estimates that gaps are produced by 2-gluon exchange at the 10% level and that such gaps have a survival probability of 10% .",

    "<S> although we have a theory of strong interactions , its implications for the physics of average hadron collisions , which is the focus of this series of conferences , are far from obvious . </S>",
    "<S> qcd has nevertheless been a very powerful guide and i will argue that a consensus description of  soft \" hadronic physics is emerging at least at the phenomenological level , even though the message is hidden by a myriad of competing models such as the lipatov pomeron , the jet model , dual topological unitarization , etc . understanding this physics is a high priority not only because it is intrinsically interesting ( e.g.  the search for chiral condensates or for point - like structure of the pomeron ) , but because it dictates the structure of the backgrounds and underlying events in any hadron collider experiment . in the not so distant future </S>",
    "<S> most of particle physics will rely on such machines and i will therefore emphasize issues associated with the physics exploitation of future colliders ( e.g.  rapidity gaps ) . </S>",
