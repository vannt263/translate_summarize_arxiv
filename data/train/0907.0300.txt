    "sfpes of type or similar with a min- or max - operation involved turn up in various fields of applied probability like probabilistic combinatorial optimization , the run - time analysis of divide - and - conquer algorithms or branching particle systems , where they typically characterize the asymptotic distribution of some random variable of interest ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the probabilistic worst - case analysis of hoare s find algorithm leads to the following fixed - point equation for the distributional limit @xmath36 of the linearly scaled maximal number of key comparisons of .@xmath37 where @xmath38 is a uniform @xmath39 $ ] random variable and @xmath40 are independent copies of the random variable @xmath36 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* example 38 ) ) . by a theorem of rschendorf ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.2 ) ) , under appropriate conditions on the random coefficients of the sfpes above , there is a one - to - one relationship between the solutions of the max - type equation and the corresponding homogeneous equation .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to study the homogeneous equation @xmath47 which is equivalent to eq .   by an application of the involution @xmath48 .",
    "( note that if in eq .",
    "@xmath36 has an atom in @xmath49 , then this atom becomes an atom in @xmath50 in the equivalent equation .",

    "( [ minfp1 ] ) was given by jagers and rsler @xcite who pointed out the following connection of with its additive counterpart @xmath51 and the corresponding map @xmath52 , defined by @xmath53 which is usually called the _ smoothing transformation _",
    "due to durrett and liggett @xcite .",
    "namely , rewriting in terms of the laplace transform @xmath54 , say , of @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath55 for all @xmath28 , which is the direct analog of ( [ minfp2 ] ) .",
    "but since any laplace transform vanishing at @xmath50 and thus pertaining to a distribution on @xmath56 can also be viewed as the survival function of a ( continuous ) probability distribution on @xmath16 , one has the implication @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the set of all positive solutions to . defining @xmath59 ,",
    "one further has @xmath60 owing to the fact that @xmath61 .",
    "however , jagers and rsler also give an example which shows that this implication can not be reversed .",
    "we take up their example ( the water cascades example ) in section [ cascade ] in a generalized form .",
    "eq .   for the situation where the @xmath62 , are deterministic but not necessarily nonnegative is discussed in detail by alsmeyer and rsler @xcite .",
    "their results concerning the case of nonnegative weights can be summarized as follows : except for simple cases nontrivial fixed - points exist iff @xmath5 possesses a _",
    "characteristic exponent _ , defined as the unique positive number @xmath63 such that @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the set of solutions @xmath22 can be described as follows : for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , let @xmath67 be the set of left continuous , multiplicatively @xmath68-periodic functions @xmath69 such that @xmath70 is nondecreasing .",
    "the distribution @xmath15 on @xmath56 with survival function @xmath71 is then called @xmath68-periodic weibull distribution with parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in short @xmath68-@xmath74 .",

    "i.e. _ , the set of distributions @xmath15 having a survival function @xmath79 ( @xmath28 ) for some positive constant @xmath80 . then @xmath81 or @xmath82 , respectively , depending on whether the closed multiplicative subgroup @xmath83 generated by the positive @xmath84 , which we denote by @xmath85 , equals @xmath86 or @xmath87 for some @xmath66 . in view of this result ,",
    "the result of alsmeyer and rsler extends classical results on extreme value distributions and the problem adressed in this paper , the analysis of eq .",
    "is a further generalization of the analysis of extreme values , namely , of the distributional equation of homogeneous min - stability for in our situation the scaling factor is replaced by random coefficients .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to investigate under which conditions similar results hold true in the situation of random weights @xmath84 , @xmath88 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in which cases weibull distributions or suitable mixtures of them are solutions to .",
    "this calls for extended definitions of @xmath85 and of the characteristic exponent : we define @xmath85 as the minimal closed multiplicative subgroup @xmath89 such that @xmath90 .",
    "we further define @xmath91 $ ] by @xmath92 and then the characteristic exponent as the minimal positive @xmath93 such that @xmath94 if such an @xmath6 exists . with these generalizations ,",
    "we obtain a connection between certain weibull mixtures and _ @xmath6-regular solutions _ , defined as solutions @xmath15 to such that the ratio @xmath95 stays bounded away from 0 and @xmath50 as @xmath96 approaches @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , theorem [ alpha - elementar - darstellung ] will show that any @xmath6-regular fixed point is a mixture of weibull distributions with parameter @xmath6 and particularly _",
    "@xmath6-elementary _ which means that @xmath95 converges to a positive constant as @xmath97 through a residue class relative to @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , theorem [ alpha - elementar - charakterisierung ] will provide an exact characterization of when @xmath6-elementary solutions to eq .   exist .",
    "both , the existence of weibull mixtures as fixed points and the existence of regular fixed points , are related to the existence of the characteristic exponent , which also plays a fundamental role in the analysis of eq .  .",

    "the afore - mentionded pathwise renewal equation will form a key ingredient .",
    "as already mentioned , section [ cascade ] provides a discussion of eq .   for a class of examples where the characteristic exponent does not generally exist .",
    "finally , section [ conrem ] contains some results for eq .  , which are closely related to ours and can be derived by the same methods .",
    "theorem [ alpha - elementar - charakterisierung2 ] and theorem [ alpha - elementar - darstellung2 ] are extensions of theorem 2 and proposition 3 in @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to a brief discussion of simple cases and a justification of the following two basic assumptions on @xmath5 ( or , to be more precise , on the distribution of @xmath5 ) : put @xmath98 and consider @xmath99 @xmath100 by our standing assumption , @xmath101 .",
    "hence , if fails to be true , then @xmath102 a.s .",
