    "the development of radio telescopes with resolution better than one minute of arc , and the increasing sophistication of astronomical image processing techniques , have made it possible to undertake large  scale , sub  arcminute surveys presenting the data not just in catalogue form , but also as images .",
    "such high  resolution radio imaging surveys are analogous to optical schmidt sky surveys , and can play a similarly valuable role in discovering new and interesting individual objects and studying the universe on the largest scales . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "sub  arcminute radio surveys have been completed , or are well advanced , with the vla ( nvss : condon et al .",

    "the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) described in this paper covers areas of sky not accessible to northern telescopes , and provides radio spectral index information in the regions of overlap .",
    "the molonglo radio observatory has a long history of radio survey work .",
    "the original telescope ( the 408mhz molonglo cross ) had a resolution of 2.8@xmath4 .",
    "between 1966 and 1978 its achievements included an imaging survey of the galactic plane ( green 1974 ) , acquisition of the data for the molonglo reference catalogue of radio sources ( mrc : large et al .",
    "1981 , large et al .  1991 ) and the discovery of 186 pulsars ( manchester et al .  1978 ) .",
    "the 408mhz molonglo cross was closed in 1978 and its east  west reflector was used in a new instrument , the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) , an imaging radio telescope operating at 843mhz .",
    "a review of the work of the molonglo cross and its conversion to the most was given by mills ( 1991 ) at the symposium celebrating the 25th anniversary of the molonglo observatory .",
    "after more than a decade of successful observations with , and technical enhancements of , the most , it became clear that it would be feasible and desirable to increase the telescope s field of view from 1 to 5 square degrees .",
    "this project , which involved the installation of hundreds of low noise preamplifiers and associated if amplifiers and phase shifters , was completed in march 1997 .",
    "the upgraded telescope now has the capacity to survey the southern sky to faint limits at a rate of @xmath51000 square degrees per year .",
    "this survey rate , combined with the relatively low frequency of operation , good sensitivity ( rms noise level @xmath2 1 mjy beam@xmath3 ) and stable configuration , makes the upgraded most a particularly powerful tool for carrying out an all  sky radio imaging survey .    in this paper",
    "we first describe (  2 ) the upgraded most , its mode of operation and some characteristics of the wide  field radio images it produces .",
    "we then explain (  3 ) how our new southern radio survey has been designed , and discuss (  4 ) some of the planned follow  up science . a second paper ( cram et al.1998 , in preparation ) will discuss the data processing pipeline . details of the closely ",
    "related most galactic plane survey ( @xmath6 ) will be published at a later date .",
    "the most ( mills 1981 ; robertson 1991 ) is an east  west array operating at 843mhz .",
    "it comprises two co - linear cylindrical paraboloids ( ` arms ' ) , each 11.6 m wide and 778 m long , separated by a 15 m gap . the geometrical aperture of over 18,000m@xmath7 is the largest of any radio telescope in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the most is essentially an array of mechanically steered antenna elements which return intermediate frequency signals to a central location for image processing .",
    "the antenna elements of the most are 44 contiguous 17.8 m lengths of each arm ( referred to as ` bays ' ) .",
    "figure 1        defines the parameters of most s natural coordinate system ( tilt and meridian distance ) .",
    "note that the most resembles a conventional alt ",
    "az telescope , but with the important difference that the fixed axis is aligned horizontally ( east  west ) rather than vertically .",
    "all 88 bays are steered to the same tilt by rotation of the reflectors about their east  west axis .",
    "each bay is also steered to the same meridian distance ( angular distance from the meridian plane ) by differential rotation of the ring antennas ( spaced at 0.54 @xmath8 ) which comprise the line feed .",
    "since the most is an east  west array , full aperture synthesis requires continuous observation for 12 hours . during an observation , the bays track the chosen field center , while the array tracking is achieved by introducing appropriate , frequently updated phases and delays into the signals from each bay .",
    "the meridian distance of the most is restricted to the range @xmath9 .",
    "thus , in principle , the most can fully synthesize in a 12hour observation any field south of declination @xmath10 .",
    "fields north of @xmath10 can be only partially synthesised . in practice ,",
    "the northern declination limit for full synthesis is about @xmath11 .",
    "multi - beaming circuits form a comb of 64 hard  wired real  time fan beams at the nyquist spacing of 22@xmath12 .",
    "most images are formed by the technique of earth  rotation fan beam synthesis ( perley 1979 ; crawford 1984 ) . in its original configuration",
    ", the most had a basic field size of 23@xmath4 , extendable to 70@xmath4 by time sharing .",
    "in preparation for the present survey ( sumss ) , 352 new low - noise pre - amplifiers and associated phase shifters have been installed ( large et al .",
    "computer control of these phase shifters enables the time  shared field size to be extended to 160arcminutes ( possibly more ) by a novel technique , described in the appendix .",

    ".key characteristics of the most in its wide  field mode . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     while the sumss images will not go deeper than the earlier most source count studies , they will cover a much larger area , allowing us to compare the source counts in several areas",
    ". we would expect _ a priori _  to find a similar result wherever we look , but this will not be the case if the weakest sources ( 110 mjy ) are clustered .",
    "the region to be observed with most partly overlaps the northern nvss survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , which extends down to @xmath13 declination ( see table 3 ) .",
    "the area of overlap is 800  deg@xmath14 .",
    "the nvss images have similar angular resolution and sensitivity to the sumss ( see table 3 ) , but are at a higher frequency ( 1400mhz compared with 843mhz ) .",
    "figure 8 shows a comparison between a 5 deg@xmath14 sumss mosaic and the corresponding region from nvss . in general the images",
    "are similar , though as noted earlier sumss has superior @xmath15 coverage and will therefore record extended emission regions with greater fidelity .",

    "about 20% of the sources have @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "although care is needed in interpreting radio spectra obtained over a relatively short frequency baseline , it appears that we will be able to identify rare , but astrophysically interesting objects such as faint ultra - steep - spectrum ( uss ) sources which are likely to be galaxies at very high redshift ( rttgering 1993 ; spinrad 1994 ) .",
    "sumss will also yield spectral index information for several thousand strong southern radio sources through cross ",
    "identification with the pmn source catalogue ( griffith & wright 1993 ) , which lists sources stronger than about 50mjy at 5ghz .",
    "figure 10 shows a 17deg@xmath14 region of a sumss mosaic of the southern sky .",
    "open circles mark the positions of pmn sources from an online version of the catalogue supplied by dr alan wright .",
    "the higher sensitivity of the sumss data can clearly be seen .",
    "there are 57 pmn sources in this region , and 9 of these are clear doubles in the sumss images .",
    "the positional agreement with pmn is generally good , though two pmn sources have no sumss counterpart and another close pair of pmn sources corresponds to a single sumss source .",
    "although the surface density of pmn sources is low compared to sumss , we expect to have about 15,000 pmn sources in our survey region .",
    "with such a large sample we can look for differences in the spectral index distribution as a function of flux density , optical identification , etc .",
    "we will also measure more accurate positions for the pmn sources , so that optical identification of the entire pmn sample can be attempted for the first time .",
    "sumss will cover much of the southern sky to a depth of @xmath237 sources deg@xmath20 .",
    "such sensitivity  corresponding to a 5@xmath21 flux density limit of 5mjy at 843 mhz  is unprecedented in the south .",
    "earlier southern surveys had source densities of 0.5 deg@xmath20 for the 408  mhz molonglo reference catalogue ( mrc ; large et al .",
    "1991 ) and 23 deg@xmath20 for the pmn 5  ghz survey ( griffith & wright 1993 ) .",
    "the apparent isotropy of the radio sky reported from analysis of strong  source surveys arises mainly through sparse sampling of the source population : to detect anisotropies , a survey must reach a level faint enough for large structures to contribute more than one source to the survey . there is now convincing evidence for large  scale structure in the spatial distribution of faint radio sources ( wall et al .",
    "1993 , kooiman et al .",
    "cress et al.(1996 ) have measured the angular two  point correlation function for radio sources above 1mjy in a 1550 square degree region of sky covered by the first survey , and show that faint radio sources are clustered on scales of 0.2 to 2 degrees .",
    "several clustering studies are possible with sumss data ; for example we can measure the two  point correlation function over large areas of sky , provided that our data are sufficiently uniform in quality . the wide ",
    "field most images provide information on structures @xmath2100 mpc or larger , i.e. intermediate between the @xmath21gpc scales sampled by the cobe microwave background fluctuations and the 10100mpc scales probed by optical and iras galaxy - clustering studies ( eg .",
    "geller & huchra 1989 ; maddox et al.1990 ; ramella et al .",
    "1992 ; benn & wall 1995 ) .",
    "without redshift measurements , however , radio  source surveys probe only the projected distribution of galaxies ( radio flux densities are essentially uncorrelated with redshift , because of the broadness of the radio luminosity function ) .",
    "dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) show that a combination of source counts with incomplete identifications and measured redshifts can be used to estimate the distribution of radio sources with redshift for different flux density limits .",
    "the first detection of the 3d clustering of radio sources was made by peacock & nicholson ( 1991 ) , based on a redshift survey of 329 galaxies with 0.01 @xmath22 z @xmath22 0.1 and a 1400mhz flux density above 500mjy .",
    "if we can determine the statistical properties of the redshift distribution of sumss sources as a function of flux density , it would be possible to study radio source clustering in three dimensions over a wide redshift range .",
    "this would be an ambitious project , requiring considerable follow ",
    "up time on optical telescopes .",
    "cross  comparison with optical catalogues will allow us to determine which members of known classes of optical objects ( for example nearby galaxies , or optically - selected qsos ) are detected as radio sources .",
    "evolution in their radio properties with redshift is an important cosmological indicator and there are special statistical tools  such as survival analysis ( isobe et al .",
    "1986 )  to deal with low detection rates .",
    "the cosmos database ( yentis et al .  1992 ) is a powerful tool for automatic identification of radio sources ( unewisse et al .",
    "1993 ) , and most positions are accurate enough for unambiguous identification of sources stronger than about 10mjy , where the position errors are @xmath23 . for the faintest sources ( @xmath25 mjy )",
    "the error climbs to @xmath24 ( see  2.1.3 ) , and tests using real data and randomly  offset radio positions suggest that the completeness and reliability of position  based optical identifications falls to about 5060% .",
    "experience with current most images shows that 2530% of sources above 5mjy have an optical counterpart recorded by cosmos ( with the proviso noted above ) . for a 5mjy detection limit",
    ", we therefore expect to detect at least 40 sources per field with cosmos counterparts .",
    "current cosmos data cover the blue ( b@xmath25 ) band , but two  colour ( b , r ) data from the cambridge apm survey are expected to be available soon , and will give us a powerful way of identifying rare classes of objects .",
    "for example , the optical counterparts of the most distant ( z @xmath26 4 ) quasars are extremely red ( b@xmath27r @xmath263 ; mcmahon & irwin 1991 )",
    ". it would be straightforward to produce a list of very red optical objects associated with radio sources for spectroscopic follow  up , in the expectation that many would be high  redshift radio  loud quasars .",
    "cross  comparison with optical catalogues will allow us to determine which members of known classes of optical objects are detected as radio sources .",
    "catalogues we plan to use include :    @xmath28 the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3;de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the detection rate of rc3 galaxies ( mostly spirals ) is @xmath230% in the the few sumss fields for which a comparison has so far been made ; further observations are required to establish better statistics .",

    "about 2% of these galaxies are detected as radio sources by sumss and/or nvss . by combining sumss data with the 2df galaxy redshift survey results , it will be possible to measure the 843mhz flux density or upper limit for a sample of about 75,000 ` normal ' galaxies in the redshift range @xmath29 .",

    "the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) has recently been upgraded to widen the field of view to 5 square degrees .",
    "this has enabled us to begin a deep radio imaging survey of the southern sky , with sensitivity and resolution similar to those attained by the northern nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) .",
    "the reduced survey data will be made publicly available as the survey proceeds , and can be used to tackle a wide variety of astronomical problems .    the molonglo observatory site manager , duncan campbell  wilson , and the technical staff jeff webb and michael white have made invaluable contributions to the installation and commissioning of the new wide  field hardware .",
    "they , together with our recent appointees at the observatory , john van beekhuizen and nancye westworth have continuing responsibility for the telescope maintenance and for running the sumss observational program .",
    "we warmly thank them for their dedication to these demanding tasks .",

    "the most is operated with the support of the australian research council and the science foundation for physics within the university of sydney .",
    "when the most was developed from the 408 mhz mills cross , the field size was limited by the available funding and by the configuration of the cross . with the growing interest in exploiting beam  forming techniques in the next generation of radio telescopes ( e.g. for the square kilometer array ) , it is of interest to report here the techniques used to more than quadruple the original field of view of the instrument .",
    "the most was formed by converting the east  west arm of the mills cross into a steerable phased array operating at 843 mhz . for this purpose",
    "the arm was divided into 88 bays , each @xmath32 long .",
    "the field of the most was essentially the `` primary '' beam of an individual bay .",
    "in the _ tilt _ direction the bay beamwidth ( fwhm ) was @xmath33 , related to the physical width of the reflector . in the _",
    "meridian distance _",
    "( md ) direction it was @xmath34 md , set by the @xmath32 length of a bay .",
    "the bay length was thus a crucial parameter in the original design of the most , determining the field size and speed as an imaging telescope as well as the overall cost and complexity of the conversion .    a second funding  limited factor was the size of the correlator or multibeamer .",
    "the analog multibeaming system forms a _",
    "block _ of 64 hard  wired fan beams , having a profile appropriate earth  rotation image synthesis .",
    "these beams are equally spaced at near the nyquist interval of @xmath35 md .",
    "the width of this block of beams limits the field size realized by the most ( in its basic mode of operation ) to @xmath36(r.a . @xmath37",
    "sources lying outside this field , but within the primary beam of the bays , are partially synthesized .    in the original design of the most",
    ", provision was made to increase the fully synthesized field size by a time  sharing technique in which the comb of beams was offset @xmath38 md from the field center in a 24 s cycle .",
    "this technique increases the field to @xmath39 , a nine  fold increase in sky area .",
    "it also results in a loss of sensitivity and the augmentation of grating  ring sidelobes .    in 1989",
    ", each bay was divided in two , doubling the number of independent antenna elements in the most from 88 to 176 . at the same time",
    "a simple phase switching system was installed which allowed the beam of a bay to be offset in synchrony with the offset of the comb of fan beams .",
    "the result was a marked improvement in the quality of the @xmath39  images .",
    "( amy & large 1990 )",
    ".    the success of the 1989 technique encouraged us to investigate methods for increasing the size of the fully synthesized field to make full use of the @xmath40 width of the primary beam in the tilt coordinate .",
    "an increased field size could be achieved only by increasing once more the number of independent elements in the array , enabling the formation of more independent fan beams . for practical and economic reasons we decided to increase the number of beams by extending the time  sharing principle , rather than by constructing a larger multibeamer or correlator .",
    "four new low noise preamplifiers ( lna ) were installed in each bay ( ie one lna for each 6.25 @xmath8 length of the arm ) , together with computer  controlled phase shifters . the configuration is shown in figure 11 .",
    "the purpose of the phase shifters is to apply a ( rapidly changeable ) four  step phase gradient to the bay , thus offsetting its beam . shifting the bay  beams in this way is analagous to the short antenna slews used in close  packed mosaicing observations with the australia telescope compact array and the vla .",
    "electronic control of the phase shifters allows the field to be widened by cyclically offsetting the primary beam of the bays to each of n meridian distances from the nominal ( tracked ) field center .",
    "these offsets of the primary beam are synchronized with corresponding offsets of the comb of fan beams .",
    "the technique can be understood with reference to figure 12 .",
    "figure  12  ( a ) shows the beams at meridian transit superimposed on the field ( shaded circle ) to be imaged by time  sharing .",
    "the grating lobes which inevitably arise from the periodic bay structure of the most are also shown .    as can be seen in the profile ,",
    "the fan beams are centered on the peak of the bay beam , while the first ",
    "order grating responses due to the bay periodicity are small as they lie at the nulls of the bay beam .",
    "figure  12  ( b ) illustrates two problems which arise with the time ",
    "sharing technique when the comb of beams alone is offset :      both these problems are solved by offsetting the bay beams synchronously with the fan beams , as shown in figure  12  ( c ) .",
    "the implementation of this facility to offset the bay beams rapidly and simultaneously with the fan beams is the essence of the upgrade which makes the survey described in this paper practicable .    before 1997 , the usual field size of most observations was @xmath39 , the comb of beams being cycled through three positions . in the wide  field mode used for the sumss , the beams are ( usually ) cycled through 7 positions .",
    "the observing time spent on each position is thus reduced by a factor of 7/3 and the expected signal  to  noise reduced by a factor of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . the reduction in signal  to ",
    "noise has proved to be quite small , as the new preamplifiers have a markedly lower input noise . the 7/3 increase in the meridian distance range covered by the time sharing increases the fully synthesized field area by a factor of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . in practice",
    "the increase of usable field area is somewhat less than the factor of 5.4 , since the signal  to  noise deteriorates towards the extreme edge of the field as discussed in the main text .",
    "the field area imaged by the most is now limited by the width of the primary ( bay ) beam in the tilt direction .",
    "consequently , no further increases in the field size are possible if full synthesis of the field is to be completed in one 12 hour observation .",
    "however , in principle the data acquisition rate of the most could be increased by further increases in the number of independent antenna elements and fan beams .",
    "the speed of the instrument for making imaging surveys of large areas would increase pro rata , but full synthesis would depend on combining data from many days observation ."
