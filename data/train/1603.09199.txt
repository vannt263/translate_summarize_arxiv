    "the notion of a causal set or causet introduced in @xcite is a proposed framework for developing a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it posits that spacetime can is in some sense a continuous approximation of a set of points with a partial order given by causal precedence .",
    "it is ontologically parsimonious , and hence elegant , but being only in its nascency , it still lacks much to be a full theory of quantum gravity .",
    "much work has been done by examining the behaviour of random causets in minkowski space as an attempt to derive an appropriate notion of convergence @xcite and dynamics @xcite , including the promising transitive percolation model .    despite much work",
    "a satisfying proof of convergence of random causets has remained elusive . for a geometric analyst used to studying convergence of metric spaces ,",
    "the obvious answer is to generalise the notion of gromov  hausdorff convergence to causal - metric spaces .",
    "this was done by noldus in @xcite , who constructed a distance between compact subsets of causal spaces @xmath5 @xmath6 presently denoted @xmath7 which noldus showed forms a complete metric on the class of compact causal spaces @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the convergence in the noldus metric of a poisson process @xmath0 on @xmath1 with the lorentzian metric @xmath8 .",
    "the process @xmath0 inherits a causal structure from @xmath1 , which allows us to define a discrete causal - metric on @xmath0 given by @xmath9 for any two points @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a number which only depends on the dimension .",
    "we prove the following theorem :    for every dimension @xmath12 there are numbers @xmath13 , @xmath14 such that for every interval @xmath15 , every @xmath16 if a density @xmath17 satisfies @xmath18 then [ thm : convergence_in_probability ] @xmath19 in particular @xmath20 in probability as @xmath21 .",
    "the proof of the theorem is straightforward , and can be seen by bounding the noldus distance to a uniform lattice , and applying the following corollary of two later theorems which is claimed by bollobs and brightwell in @xcite :    let @xmath22 denote the longest height of a chain in @xmath23",
    ". for every @xmath12 there are numbers @xmath11 and @xmath24 such that for every @xmath25 .",
    "[ cor : concentration_of_measure ] @xmath26    this follows directly by combinging theorems [ thm : deviation_from_mean ] and [ thm : convergence_of_mean ] noting that @xmath27 .",
    "theorems [ thm : deviation_from_mean ] and [ thm : convergence_of_mean ] are direct generalisations of the corresponding result of bollobs and brightwell , which as they state only requires a little effort ( provided here for the benefit of the reader ) .    the idea of using the height of maximal chains to define a timelike distance , is essentially quantised proper time , i.e. proper time is allowed to take values only in @xmath28 , for some scale factor @xmath29 .",
    "we consider consider minkowski space @xmath1 with the lorentzian metric @xmath30 this defines a natural causal - metric on @xmath1 by @xmath31    for our purposes a causal distance @xmath32 satisfies the following three properties    1 .",

    "if @xmath36 and @xmath38 then @xmath39    although causal distances superficially resemble metrics , the reverse triangle inequality makes working with them highly nonintuitive .",
    "we can define the timelike height of a set @xmath4 to be @xmath40",
    "most of our results will be contingent on the height of the set under investigation . the notion will also be useful in rescaling the sets under consideration to a standard reference set .",
    "we define the causal future of a point @xmath41 to by @xmath42 and the causal past of @xmath43 to be @xmath44 then for any two points @xmath45 we define the spacetime interval @xmath46 in particular for minkowski space @xmath47    because minkowksi space is preserved under lorentz transformations , it is useful to introduce the minkowski diamond , which is the set @xmath48 this slight abuse of notation is introduced for legibility s sake , as the latter while more technically correct is less readable and less intuitive than the former .",
    "most importantly the standard minkowski diamond is the set @xmath49 .",
    "this has @xmath50-dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 consequently , because every non - empty spacetime interval @xmath53 can be translated and then lorentz boosted into a minkowski diamond of the form @xmath54 , it follows that @xmath55    given two causal metric spaces @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57 we say they are @xmath58 close if there are maps @xmath59 and @xmath60 such that @xmath61 and @xmath62 the noldus distance is @xmath63 for brevity s sake we will omit the causal distance functions when it is clear , i.e. @xmath64 when @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be obviously ( within the context of this article ) be assigned causal metrics .",
    "noldus introduced his notion of distance @xcite , as a generalisation of gromov s notion of gromov ",
    "hausdorff distance for metric spaces .",
    "the important properties proved in @xcite and @xcite are that this is indeed a metric on the class of compact causal metric spaces .",
    "a causal set or causet , is a set @xmath67 with a partial order @xmath68 . in other words",

    "a causet has a natural causal distance given by @xmath72 causets were proposed as a potential perspective for quantum gravity in @xcite .",
    "although causets are posets , it seems beneficial to refer to them as causets in the context of quantum gravity , to emphasise their relation to causality .    one idea of the causet program has been to use poisson processes as a toy model of discretised spacetime .",
    "the primary benefit of a poisson process , as opposed to deterministic discretisation of spacetime , is that it is lorentz invariant , i.e. given a lorentz boost @xmath73 , and a poisson process with density @xmath17 , @xmath0 , @xmath74 is also a poisson process with density @xmath17 .",
    "a poisson process with density @xmath17 is defined by the following properties ,    1 .",

    "@xmath80 @xmath81 are independent random variables .",
    "a poisson process can be constructed by subdividing a @xmath82-finite measure space @xmath83 into countable many disjoint sets of finite measure @xmath84 and for each @xmath84 defining a poisson randomvariable @xmath85 distributed like @xmath86 , and @xmath87 uniform random variables in @xmath84    given a poisson process with density @xmath17 , @xmath0 on a causal metric space @xmath88 equipped with a @xmath82-finite measure @xmath89 , @xmath0 inherits a causal structure from @xmath88 via @xmath70 if and only if @xmath90 or @xmath36 .",

    "an important property that follows immediately from lorentz invariance and the scaling properties of poisson processes us @xmath94",
    "the goal of this section is to apply a `` little effort '' and modify the proof of bollobs and brightwell in @xcite to apply to minkowski space as they claim following their theorem 1 .",
    "the first step is to modify the proof of theorem 3 from the case of the cartesian order to that of the standard minkowski diamond .",
    "the only modifications are minor modifications in certain quantities .",
    "let @xmath93 .",
    "for every @xmath95 [ thm : deviation_from_mean ] @xmath96    one difference between the minkowksi diamond and the cartesian order is the division of strips . in minkowksi space",
    "we just divide the time coordinate @xmath97 instead of the sum @xmath98 .",
    "the strips are defined as @xmath99 , and applying lemma 4 from @xcite .    now following bollobs and brightwell we define a new random variable @xmath100 note in the case of the cartesian order",
    "there is a @xmath101 as opposed to @xmath102 .",
    "we let @xmath103 .",
    "this follows because the positive light cone from a point intersected with a strip @xmath104 intersects at most @xmath105 cubes of side length @xmath106 .",

    "one avenue of attack would thus be to try to cover a timelike curve in a lorentzian manifold by a series of spacetime intervals . as the size of the intervals gets smaller",
    "they will be better approximated by the mikowskian case , and this should give a bound on the probability of deviation of a maximal chain in the causet , from the geodesic in the underlying manifold .    the notion of noldus convergence clearly formalises an intuitive notion of convergence of causets , allowing several questions to be amenable to mathematical analysis , but in order to extrapolate appropriate dynamics for causets one would need to ascribe an appropriate notion of convergence for certain other differential geometric , and operator theoretic concepts , like curvature , spinor fields , connections , the dalembertian , etc .",
