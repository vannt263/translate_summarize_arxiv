    "the essence of mixing of a fluid with itself can be understood in terms of an array of striations of , say , two different colors of the same fluid ( or two different fluids such as coffee and cream ) undergoing stretching and folding . on top of stretching and folding",
    "we may superimpose diffusion , reaction , and , in special circumstances , breakup processes leading to droplet formation.@xcite this approach is the backbone of lamellar models of mixing .",
    "a fundamental measure of the quality of mixing is @xmath0 , the interfacial area per unit volume of the striations ( lamella or layers ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be the interfacial area between fluid layers within a volume @xmath2 enclosing the point @xmath3 at time @xmath4 , then the interfacial area per unit volume is given by@xcite @xmath5 a larger @xmath0 corresponds to better mixing .",
    "we can imagine many iterative mixing protocols that generate large values of @xmath0 and create striations of the material of continually decreasing thickness in time . for fluids , a multitude of clever mixing designs can lead to the thinning of lamella , many inspired by a direct correspondence between the kinematics of mixing and chaotic dynamical systems.@xcite the simplest representation of mixing in terms of stretching and folding is the smale horseshoe map , which stretches out a piece of material and folds it onto itself to form the shape of a horseshoe . a limiting case of this procedure",
    "is a map that stretches , cuts and re - stacks to generate interfacial area , the baker s transformation , named after the process by which a baker kneads dough .",
    "granular mixing has been studied as well , but less extensively than fluid mixing . in many respects ,",
    "the ideas applied to fluids carry over to granular matter.@xcite a key difference between the two is that granular flows may present surfaces of discontinuity , such as the interface between a flowing surface layer and the underlying static bed of granular material in an avalanche.@xcite this new aspect of the flow leads to different models for the kinematics . in particular , mixing in granular flows in rotating containers@xcite ( `` tumblers '' ) can be thought of as `` cutting and shuffling,''@xcite a process different from stretching and folding.@xcite more on the fascinating behavior of granular matter can be found in ref .  .",
    "stretching is a fundamental concept in mechanics and is covered in every continuum mechanics textbook in the context of kinematics ( see , for example , the classic volumes of truesdell@xcite and gurtin@xcite ) , where it is identified with shear or extensional strain . cutting and shuffling , in contrast , has been explored only recently . to illustrate the fundamental difference between the mixing mechanisms of stretching and folding versus cutting and shuffling , we compare two types of simple idealized mixing protocols : the well - known baker s map and cutting and shuffling maps based on interval exchange transformations . along the way we discuss the elegant connection between continuum mechanics and dynamical systems and",
    "show how some of the calculations of the relevant kinematic quantities , such as the deformation gradient and the principal stretches , are performed .",
    "pertinent concepts from the theory of mixing are also reviewed within this context .",

    "we restrict our discussiuon to two spatial dimensions for simplicity.@xcite consider a motion @xmath6 from the undeformed ( reference or initial ) configuration of the continuum ( body ) @xmath7 to the deformed ( current or final ) configuration @xmath8 at time @xmath4 , both of which are regions in the euclidean plane . keeping with the mathematics notation , in this paper , we denote sets by capital calligraphic letters . typically , we concern ourselves with motions that map the body back into itself , that is , @xmath9 , but this restriction is not important for what follows .",

    "that is , we allow only @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the duration ( period ) of the motion and @xmath12 is a positive integer .",

    "we can now define the deformation gradient ( or jacobian matrix of the map ) as @xmath21 it is typically assumed that the map is invertible and differentiable a sufficient number of times so that @xmath22 exists and @xmath23.@xcite in this paper we relax the differentiability assumption to consider a wider ( and , arguably , more interesting ) class of motion .",

    "[ sec : kinematics ] , the square root of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath62 is the largest principal stretch ( for the deformation resulting from applying the map @xmath12 times ) .",
    "therefore , there is a one - to - one relation between the largest finite - time lyapunov exponent and the largest principal stretch : @xmath63 if the limit in eq .",

    "note that , in this context , the chaotic dynamics occur in physical space , not in phase space as is the case for the dynamical systems of classical mechanics.@xcite    there is a temptation to equate stretching and folding motions ( equivalently , ones that give rise to chaotic dynamical systems ) with efficient generation of @xmath0 .",
    "however , as we will show in the following examples , there are other possibilities for generating @xmath0 without stretching and folding .",
    "one of the best known stretching and folding operations is the baker s map,@xcite which can be found as early as 1951 in the mixing literature@xcite and 1937 in the mathematics literature.@xcite in contrast , cutting and shuffling , two examples of which we construct using interval exchange transformations , is a type of mixing protocol that has been proposed only recently.@xcite suppose we begin with a square region , half of which is filled with a while material while the other half is filled with a gray material ( see fig .",

    "the smale horseshoe map@xcite is classical example of stretching and folding .",
    "however , the horseshoe map does not preserve area , which has significant implications for the types of chaos exhibited by the dynamical system because it allows for the existence of _",
    "attractors_.@xcite we avoid such complications by idealizing the smale horseshoe map as the baker s map .    from eqs .",

    "this interval exchange transformation is equivalent to cutting a deck of 8 cards exactly in half and shuffling them perfectly so that the bottom card from the first half ( gray ) is just below the bottom hard from the second half ( white ) , and so on . as shown in the middle path of fig .",

    "the apparent thickness of these lines is due to the coarse - grained view of the deformation that we obtain from the numerical data .",
    "taking more points ( larger @xmath172 ) makes these lines arbitrarily thin .",
    "( their thickness is @xmath173 , that is , twice the spacing between points because we used a central difference approximation to @xmath22 . )",
    "if we had applied the map more times ( larger @xmath12 ) and/or had fewer material points , then the resulting thicker cuts would completely obscure the picture .    in fig .",

    "we can also calculate @xmath48 from the numerical data by taking the square root of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath175^\\top\\widetilde{\\mathbf{f}}_{\\mathrm{bm}}(\\bm{x};2)$ ] ( recall the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] ) , where @xmath176 is defined in eq .  .",
    "in complete agreement with the theoretical result , the numerical calculation produces a `` background '' value ( that is , the value of @xmath48 away from the cuts discussed above ) of 4 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stretches](a ) .",
    "this result can also be anticipated by realizing that the baker s map stretches the continuum in the @xmath107-direction by a factor of 2 . applying the map",
    "twice gives a stretch ratio of 4 .",
    "similarly , for both of the cutting and shuffling maps , the largest principal stretch is equal to 1 for all @xmath12 from eq .",

    "[ fig : stretches](b ) and ( c ) confirms that @xmath177 . in both cases ,",
    "the background value in the plots is 1 , and @xmath48 is different from the `` background '' value only along the cuts , where it is infinite .",
    "the mixing of continua can be accomplished by a great variety of maps of different complexities . in mechanics , the central theme is stretching . stretching leads to a positive lyapunov exponent and chaos when the problem is translated into the language of dynamical systems . for mixing ,",
    "the central theme is generation of interfacial area per unit volume @xmath0 .",
    "stretching and folding ( equivalently , chaotic dynamics ) is an efficient way to do this .",
    "surprisingly , cutting and shuffling can also `` rearrange ''",
    "material points in a continuum quite well .",
    "the cutting and shuffling maps , which would be considered pathological in `` classical '' continuum mechanics,@xcite do not stretch , possess no positive lyapunov exponents , and exhibit no chaotic behavior in the usual sense , yet they mix . even though interfacial area is produced at an asymptotically slower rate than for a chaotic motion that stretches , for short times it appears possible for cutting and shuffling to dominate stretching and folding , depending on the number of cuts @xmath100 in eq .   and the growth rate @xmath178 in eq .",
    "although we may be misled to conclude that a cutting and shuffling map stretches the underlying continuum based on the complicated pattern of non - uniform striations produced by it , analytical and sufficiently - refined numerical calculations show otherwise .",
    "recent work@xcite takes the idea of cutting and shuffling even further , arguing that it provides the `` skeleton '' of certain regimes of granular flow in tumblers . in the present work ,",
    "we illustrated how cutting and shuffling can also lead to mixing without chaos . and ,",
    "in more complicated maps , cutting and shuffling can lead to complex dynamics without chaos in any usual sense of the word.@xcite thus , cutting and shuffling maps and their generalizations are more than just a mathematical exercise , and have the potential to accurately describe the underlying framework of mixing in physical systems .",

    "ergodicity means material points `` spread out '' enough so that the long - time `` average color '' ( for our mixing example ) computed at a given location in space should equal the average color over the entire domain at some given time .",
