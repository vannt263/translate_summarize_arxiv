    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions @xcite is in complete agreement with all precision experimental data ( lep , tevatron , sld ) .",
    "so far undiscovered is the sm higgs boson ( @xmath6 ) , which is the major goal of present and future colliders .",
    "global sm fits @xcite favour a relatively light @xmath6 , suggesting that it should be observed soon at forthcoming colliders .",
    "a light higgs boson is also a feature of supersymmetric ( susy ) theories , which are the most popular extensions of the sm . since 1989 lep",
    "has searched for @xmath6 in the energy range 91 gev @xmath7 gev via the mechanism @xmath8 . in the final run at energies around @xmath9 gev two of the four experiments found excesses in the search for higgs boson production @xcite in association with a z boson ( higgsstrahlung ) , while the other two presented improved lower limits on its mass @xcite of @xmath10 gev and @xmath11 gev .",
    "lep agreed that a further run with about 200 pb@xmath12 per experiment at @xmath13 gev would be enable the combined data from the four experiments to establish a 5@xmath14 discovery @xcite .",
    "however the extended run was not approved and lep was consequently shut down . the higgs search will continue with run ii at the tevatron @xcite which has a chance of confirming the existence of the higgs boson in the mass range hinted at by lep ( @xmath15 gev ) .",
    "this region is fairly problematic for the lhc @xcite and would require several years searching for @xmath16 decays in order to confirm such a light higgs",
    ".    the still hypothetical higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) can be enlarged and some simple extensions such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite are under much intensive study .",
    "both the thdm and mssm introduce 2 higgs doublets which break the electroweak symmetry @xcite . from the 8 degrees of freedom",
    "initially present in the 2 higgs doublets , 3 correspond to the masses of the longitudinal gauge bosons , leaving 5 degrees of freedom which manifest themselves as 5 physical higgs particles ( 2 charged higgs @xmath17 , 2 cp  even @xmath18 , @xmath19 and one cp  odd @xmath0 ) . aside from the charged higgs sector , the neutral scalars of the thdm may possess a very different phenomenology to that of the sm higgs .",
    "the discovery of a cp ",
    "odd higgs boson or / and charged higgs boson would be clear evidence of physics beyond the sm .",
    "detection of a cp  even neutral higgs with couplings differing significantly from those expected for @xmath6 @xcite would also provide evidence for physics beyond the sm .",
    "if the higgsstrahlung cross  section is suppressed then the mass bound on such a higgs boson is much weaker than the above bounds on @xmath20 .    until now , no higgs boson has been discovered , and from negative searches one can derive direct and indirect bounds on their masses . the combined null ",
    "searches from all four cern lep collaborations derive the lower limits @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 gev @xcite in the context of the mssm .",
    "cp - odd higgs bosons can be produced at @xmath23 colliders @xcite via @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite,@xcite . at future @xmath23 colliders",
    "the simplest way to produce cp  even higgs scalars is in the higgsstrahlung process @xmath26 .",
    "odd @xmath0 possesses no tree - level coupling @xmath0zz , and the other tree  level diagrams for such a process are proportional to the electron mass and consequently negligible .",
    "the dominant contribution is therefore from higher order diagrams which will be mediated by both sm and non  sm particles .",
    "therefore the rates are expected to be strongly model dependent .    previous work on the loop induced production of higgs bosons in association with gauge bosons ( e.g. @xmath27 ) can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , associated production @xmath28 , both for sm higgs and mssm higgs , has been studied in @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we studied the process @xmath29 , in the context of the thdm . in this paper",
    "we extend the study to the case of the mssm .",
    "the particle spectrum of the mssm doubles that of the thdm , but the scalar sectors are equivalent up to some mass relations and differences in the couplings @xcite",
    ". one would expect differences in the rates for the thdm and the mssm , since in the latter there will be contributions from loops involving sparticles .",
    "if @xmath30 were sizeable it would provide an alternative way of producing @xmath0 at @xmath23 colliders , with a kinematical reach superior to that for the mechanism @xmath31 .",
    "note that in the mssm the kinematically favoured mechanism @xmath32 is suppressed by the factor @xmath33 which is very small in the region @xmath34 gev .",
    "the study of the various production mechanisms of the cp ",
    "odd higgs boson is well motivated since the discovery of such a particle would signify that the electroweak symmetry breaking is introduced by more that one higgs doublet ( @xmath6 is cp  even ) .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline our approach for evaluating the 1loop rate for @xmath29 in the mssm . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical results and section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the limit of vanishing electron mass , the process @xmath35 posseses no tree ",
    "level contribution and is thus mediated by higher order diagrams .",
    "we have evaluated the one  loop amplitude in the thooft  feynman gauge .",
    "this amplitude contains ultraviolet divergences ( uv ) and we will use the dimensional regularization scheme @xcite to deal with them . +",
    "the typical feynman diagrams for the virtual corrections of order @xmath36 are drawn in fig.1 .",
    "these comprise :    * the fermionic contribution ( s  channel ) to the vertices @xmath37-z-@xmath0 and z - z-@xmath0 : fig.1.1 @xmath38 1.2 ( + crossed counterpart ) and fig.1.3 * susy t  channel correction to the vertex @xmath39 : fig.1.4 , fig.1.5 ( + crossed counterparts ) .",

    "1.9 and fig .",
    "note that one  loop contributions coming from initial state @xmath40 , @xmath41 vertices also vanish in the limit @xmath42 , since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are both on  shell .",
    "the t  channel vertex ( fig.1.5 ) and box diagrams fig.1.8 and fig.1.9 with exchange of charginos / sneutrinos contain vertices which violate fermion  number and we use denner rules @xcite to deal with them .",
    "all the feynman diagrams are generated and computed using feynarts and feyncalc @xcite packages .",
    "we also use the fortran ff ",
    "package @xcite in the numerical analysis .    in the mssm , the s  channel topology in ( i ) also receives contributions from sfermion triangular loops .",

    "z-@xmath0 mixing has to be considered in the t  channel , but owing to lorentz invariance the z-@xmath0 self ",
    "energy is proportional to cp odd momentum @xmath47 ; then , since the vector boson z is on  shell , the t  channel amplitude will be proportional to @xmath48 and consequently vanishes .",
    "note also that the tadpole diagrams have vanishing contributions .",
    "we stress in passing that , there are diagrams in the process @xmath29 which do not contribute to @xmath49 .",

    "the cross ",

    "odd higgs mass @xmath65 for @xmath95 gev in the case where @xmath96 ( fig.3.a ) and 40 ( fig.3.b ) . in both cases",
    "we show the mssm contribution for case l and case h , as well as the thdm contribution .",
    "it can be seen that the light susy particle scenario ( l ) may enhance the total cross  section , which can reach @xmath97 fb for @xmath98 gev and @xmath96 , with smaller cross ",
    "sections for @xmath99 .",
    "note also that for @xmath98 gev the box contribution is an order of magnitude smaller than the vertex corrections in the mssm case l , for both @xmath96 and 40 .",
    "the kink observed in this figure close to @xmath100 is a threshold effect due to the opening of the decay @xmath101 .",
    "one can also have other threshold effects which arise from charginos and neutralinos .",
    "note that in the case l and for @xmath96 ( resp 40 ) the mass of the light chargino is about 132.5 gev ( resp 146 gev ) , and one can see a smooth threshold effect due to the opening of the channel @xmath102 for @xmath103 gev ( resp @xmath104 gev ) .",
    "due to the decoupling property of susy theory , the mssm contributions in case h are very small and the total cross  section is close to the thdm one .    2.8 in 0.4 cm 2.8 in    we illustrate in fig.3 the angular distribution in the mssm with light susy particles for @xmath95 gev , @xmath96 ( left curve ) and @xmath99 ( right curve ) .",
    "the shape of the graph is in agreement with that expected for a cp  odd scalar being produced by an effective @xmath105 coupling @xcite .",
    "we stress here that in both cases , the shape of the angular distribution originates from the vertex contribution , since the box contribution is rather small at @xmath94 gev . in the case of heavy susy particles ( mssm case h ) the total cross ",
    "section is suppressed which would render difficult any analysis of the angular distribution .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath106 lies in the range 0.0019 - 0.0009 fb ( resp 0.0008 - 0.0004 fb ) with @xmath107 for @xmath96 and @xmath108 gev ( resp @xmath109 gev ) .",
    "we note in passing that the corresponding values for the thdm with @xmath110 would also be very small .",
    "it is interesting to study the behaviour of the total cross  section versus @xmath111 . since a variety of susy particles",
    "are exchanged in the vertices and boxes , we expect that more threshold effects will appear . in fig.4 , we present the total cross  section against @xmath111 in the mssm case l ( left curve ) and mssm case h ( right curve ) for several values of @xmath65 .",
    "it can be seen from the plot that there is a peak in both cases . in the mssm case l",
    ", the peak appears at @xmath112 gev since in this case the masses of susy particles are approximately 200 gev . in mssm case h , the peak shows up for @xmath113 tev .",
    "as one can see , the lighter @xmath65 is , the more spectacular are the peaks . in the mssm case l , for @xmath114 tev the dominant contribution to the total cross  section is from vertex diagrams , while for energy @xmath115 tev it is the box diagrams which dominate .",
    "similarly in the mssm case h , the vertex contibution dominates for @xmath116 tev while the box diagram dominate if @xmath117 tev .    2.8 in 0.4 cm 2.8 in",
    "we have computed the cross  section for the production mechanism @xmath29 at high energy @xmath23 colliders in the framework of the mssm .",
    "such a process proceeds via higher order diagrams and is strongly model dependent .",
    "the calculation was performed within the dimensional regularisation scheme and we presented results for both the mssm and thdm . in the former case light susy particles may give important contributions to the cross ",
    "section , resulting in maximum values of order 0.003 fb .",
    "therefore the susy enhancement is not sufficient to produce an observable signal at the planned luminosities of @xmath118 . in the mssm with explicit cp violating phases , the pseudoscalar contains a cp even component and may be produced with an observable cross - section @xcite .",
    "therefore signals in the higgsstrahlung channel for all @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath0 could not be explained in the mssm unless susy sources of cp violation are present .",
    "observation of this process might enable one to distinguish between susy and non  susy higgs sectors .",
