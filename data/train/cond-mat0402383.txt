    "the recent observations @xcite of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of molecules formed from fermionic atoms are extremely exciting . because of a feshbach resonance , in which fermions couple to molecular bosons",

    "in this paper we explore the implications of this specific ground state wavefunction @xcite in detail to address both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with particular emphasis on the  near - bec \" regime .",
    "our goals are ( i ) to emphasize how to include finite temperature effects in a manner consistent with the ground state ; this necessitates the introduction of non - condensed fermion pairs which lead to  pseudogap \" effects @xcite , ( ii ) to provide analytic calculations and insights by working in a ( near - bec ) regime where calculations are more tractable , ( iii ) to discuss in some detail the differences between the  one channel \" and  two channel \" models for the feshbach resonance , and ( iv ) to compare with well established theories of weakly interacting bose superfluid @xcite , as well as ( v ) with the measured density distributions in a trap .",
    "we begin with the homogeneous case and then consider the trap configuration ; from this we infer the ratio between the effective bosonic and fermionic scattering lengths , which is found to be strongly dependent on the magnetic detuning @xmath6 , and generally less than 2 , as a consequence of many - body combined with feshbach resonance effects .",
    "the hamiltonian used in the cold atom and high @xmath2 crossover studies consists , in its most general form , of two types of interaction effects : those associated with the direct interaction between fermions parameterized by @xmath7 , and those associated with  fermion - boson \" interactions , whose strength is governed by @xmath8 .",

    "indeed , a weakness of the mean field approach taken here ( based on a generalized bcs ground state ) is that the  inter - boson \" scattering length is treated only approximately .",

    "our inclusion of these effects corresponds @xcite to a self - consistent hartree treatment of pairing fluctuations in bcs theory , in which condensation naturally occurs in the presence of a finite excitation gap (  pre - formed pairs \" ) .",
    "our approach also makes evident the strong analogies between this generalization of bcs theory and bose condensation , where both condensed and non - condensed bosons must be properly characterized . _ in the two channel model , non - condensed bosons should be viewed as consisting of a strongly hybridized mixture of fermion pairs and feshbach bosons . in the one channel model they result exclusively from fermion",
    "pairs_.    a key aspect of this work is in the comparison we have presented between one and two channel models .",
    "differences arise because of the nature of the condensate .",
    "a fermionic or cooper pair condensate ( @xmath33 ) enters into the gap equation while a bosonic condensate ( @xmath92 ) enters also into the number equation .",
    "when there is an appreciable fraction of bosonic condensate ( as in the near - bec and bec regimes ) these differences will be apparent .",
    "a distinction between the one and two channel models is relatively unimportant once the bosonic condensate is negligible ( usually when the scattering length is large and positive or alternatively negative ) .",

    "feshbach bosons can , in effect , collapse much more completely to the center of a trap than can fermion pairs .",
    "this effect can be inferred from the ratio of the scattering lengths , and is related to the fact that in this limit , fermions are essentially absent , since the number equation constraint can be entirely satisfied by populating the bosonic state . as a result , these bosons are close to ideal .    for the relatively broad feshbach resonances currently under study in lithium and potassium , differences between the one and two channel models are presumably only important in the bec and near - bec limits studied here , where there is an appreciable bosonic condensate .",
    "it will be interesting to study narrower feshbach resonances where these differences may persist into the unitary scattering regime .",
