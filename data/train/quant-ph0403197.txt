    "manipulation of cold atoms in microscopic traps is one of the major highlights of the extraordinary progress experienced by atomic , molecular and optical ( amo ) physics over the past few years , and has lead to important successes in the implementation of quantum information processing @xcite . by employing a quantum phase transition it is possible to load large numbers of neutral atoms in highly regular patterns within an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "this system is very promising both in terms of quantum simulation of condensed matter physics , and more in general of quantum information processing .",
    "hence , over the last few years , several implementations of neutral - atom quantum computing , exploiting various trapping methods and entangling interactions , have been proposed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study quantum computing with neutral atoms in optical lattices based on the concept of _ marker _ and _ messenger _ atoms .",
    "we consider a situation where qubits are represented by the internal longlived atomic states , and these qubit atoms are stored in a ( large ) regular array of microtraps realized by an optical lattice .",
    "these qubit atoms remain frozen at their positions during the quantum computation . in addition to the atoms representing the qubits",
    ", we consider an auxiliary `` marker atom '' ( or a set of marker atoms ) which can be moved between the different lattice sites containing the qubits .",
    "the marker atoms can either be of a different atomic species or of the same type as the qubit atoms , but possibly employing different internal states .",
    "these movable atoms serve two purposes .",
    "first , they allow addressing of atomic qubits by `` marking '' a single lattice site due to the marker - atomic qubit interactions : this molecular complex can be manipulated with a laser without the requirement of focusing on a particular site .",
    "second , the movable atoms play the role of `` messenger '' qubits which allow to transport quantum information between different sites in the optical lattice , and thus to entangle distant atomic qubits .",
    "the first key element in our scheme is the _ transport of marker ( or messenger ) atoms _ in an off - resonant _ time - dependent superlattice_. by changing laser parameters with an appropriate protocol we move the marker atoms from site to site while leaving the qubit atoms frozen at their respective positions .",
    "we note that to move a marker atom only the _ global _ laser parameters generating the superlattice need to be changed . in the case of several marker atoms on a lattice ( arranged e.g. in a certain spatial pattern ) they will be moved in parallel by these global lattice operations .",
    "the time scale for these lattice movements can be of the order of the oscillation period in the confining lattice potential .",
    "in addition , two distinctive properties of the scheme are : ( i ) the superlattice can be realized by a very far - offresonant optical lattice .",
    "thus there is no requirement for a qubit- ( or spin - dependent ) optical lattice as in the case of collisional gates which in case of alkali atoms require tuning of the lattice laser between the excited atomic fine structure states .",
    "this allows to strongly suppress decoherence due to spontaneous emission in the present scheme .",
    "( ii ) there is significant freedom in choosing the internal atomic states representing the qubits : in particular , we can choose atomic states corresponding a `` clock transition '' .",
    "these clock states are insensitive to the ( stray- ) magnetic fields , again improving decoherence properties of the atomic qubits .",
    "also this is in contrast to moving atoms in spin - dependent lattices for collisional gates , where the qubit states are typically very sensitive to magnetic fields .",
    "a second key element is that we employ _ resonant molecular interactions _ between marker and qubit - atoms , as provided by magnetic or optical feshbach resonances .",
    "this implies two features of the present scheme : ( i ) due to the resonant character combined with the spatial confinement of atoms in the optical lattice , these interactions can be comparable to the trap spacing in the optical lattice , and thus the time scale of operations becomes of the same order of magnitude as the one for the transport in the lattice .",
    "( ii ) in addition , these resonant molecular interactions can be made internal state ( qubit ) dependent which gives a mechanism for entangling the marker and atomic qubits , and to perform swap operations of the atomic qubit to the marker atom .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] we introduce the general concept of quantum computing via `` marker '' qubits , and we specialize it to the case of atomic qubits in optical lattices . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] we develop and simulate a procedure to effect selective atom transport in spin - independent lattices .",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] describes the theory of resonant collisions in confined geometries , suitable for the treatment of feshbach resonance in tightly confining traps .",
    "[ sec : sec5 ] discusses the dynamics of one- and two - qubit operations using the aforementioned ingredients .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the scheme we are introducing is based on a quantum register formed by separately stored qubits , that never interact directly with each other . to mediate entangling operations between different register ( @xmath0-type ) qubits , we introduce `` marker '' or `` messenger '' ( @xmath1-type ) qubits , that can be transported through between different register locations . direct coupling can only take place between a register and a marker qubit . in the simplest situation",
    "there is only one @xmath1 qubit present in a certain register location @xmath2 .",
    "different operations are then possible ( see fig .  [ concept ] ) :    * the @xmath1 qubit can be transported forward and backward throughout the string of register qubits thus being able to reach an arbitrary location @xmath2 . * a local interaction between the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 qubit",
    "may be activated to perform single and two qubit gates .",
    "the role of the @xmath1 qubits in our scheme is twofold . on one hand they will allow us to address single register atoms without the need for addressing single lattice sites , i.e. they act as a `` marker '' for a certain register atom . on the other hand they act as information carrier performing effective entangling operations between physically distant register qubits . in this case",
    "they act as a `` messenger '' transporting quantum information .",
    "however , to simplify language , in the following we will denote the @xmath1 qubits always as marker qubits or marker atoms .",
    "the interaction we apply depends on the logical state of both of the involved qubits , i.e. it enables us to perform two - qubit gates like a controlled - phase or a swap gate between the marker and the register atom .",
    "this in turn , combined with forward and backward transport operations ( i ) , allows to construct sequences of operations that enact two - qubit gates between arbitrary register qubits .",
    "this works as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ distgate ] ) :    * the state of qubit @xmath2 is first swapped onto the marker @xmath1 ; * the marker is transported to location @xmath3 , where a two - qubit gate is performed between @xmath1 and @xmath4 ; * the marker is transported back to location @xmath5 and its state is swapped back onto @xmath2 .    :",
    "a ) swapping the first qubit onto the marker atom ; b ) transporting the marker atom unto the second qubit and local interaction ; c ) transport back to the first qubit and inverse swap . ]    at the end of the process , the marker qubit recovers its initial state , while the net effect is that a gate operation has been performed between register qubits @xmath2 and @xmath4 . beside logical operations , this allows for the creation of distant entangled ( e.g. , epr ) pairs that can be subsequently used for teleportation between different quantum memory locations , for state purification in error correcting protocols and for scalable probabilistic gates @xcite .      in the following we want to briefly outline how the above general concept can be implemented",
    "a detailed description can be found in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3]-[sec : sec5 ] . as described above the two key ingredients of our scheme",
    "are ( i ) the transport of marker atoms and ( ii ) the application of a strong local interaction .",
    "we concentrate in this work on an implementation with neutral atoms stored in a two - component optical superlattice .",
    "however , our scheme may be transferred to other systems , including atom chips @xcite .",
    "we consider single atoms stored in the ground state of separate wells which we model as a 1d periodic potential ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3a ] ) , with a simple filling pattern of one register atom @xmath2 every second lattice site .",
    "the ground states of the remaining sites may ( or may not ) be occupied by marker atoms , which can be of the same species as the register atoms , and the tunnel coupling between neighboring sites is assumed to be negligible , so that marker atoms do not interact with register atoms unless the potential is modified .",
    "the quantum information is stored in two appropriate internal states @xmath6 of the atoms ( which will be specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] ) .    as described in section [ sec : sec3 ] , the transport of the marker atoms ( i ) is realized by globally changing the external lattice control parameters which allows for creating a periodic array of double - well structures with different well depths . in this way",
    "the marker atom can be transferred from its initial site into the first excited state of one of the neighboring wells , while the register atom located there ( as well as any other register atom in the lattice ) remains in its trap ground state . from here",
    "the marker can be transported further to the ground state of the next site ( which is not occupied by an atom ) or back again to its initial position . by repeating these transport steps",
    "the marker atoms can be transported to an arbitary lattice site .",
    "this scheme avoids there being two permanently interacting atoms at any lattice site .    due to the fact that the lattice parameters are changed globally , all marker atoms undergo the same , parallel movement .",
    "thus , when more ground - state marker atoms are introduced at different sites , a certain lattice transformation will transport all of them in the same way . by suitably choosing the pattern of marker atoms ,",
    "multi - qubit operations can be carried out in parallel or with pre - defined patterns ( an example is encoding and syndrome extraction for error correction ) .    when a marker and a register atom are at the same site we realize the coupling ( ii ) of fig .",
    "[ concept ] by making use of the strong molecular interaction between the marker and the register atom , which can be controlled by an external magnetic field giving rise to a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the physics behind this mechanism , as well as the gate operations , will be detailed in secs .",
    "[ sec : sec4 ] and [ sec : sec5 ] , respectively .",
    "of course , this sort of interaction can be employed in any neutral - atom quantum computation proposal . in this paper",
    ", we will outline its general features , and we will focus on its specific use in the context of marker - atom quantum computing .",
    "the principle of the single qubit gate is the following .",
    "the marker atom is transported to the register atom we want to address .",
    "then the molecular interaction is `` switched on '' via an external magnetic or optical field , i.e. we perform a feshbach ramp which leads to a level splitting of the atomic states .",
    "clearly this splitting is only present at the site with two atoms . with appropriately detuned external lasers we can then perform arbitrary single qubit rotations @xmath7 where the angle @xmath8 is given by the interaction time with the lasers ( and their intensities ) and the phase @xmath9 is determined by the dynamics of the feshbach ramp .",
    "the lasers have not to be focused down to the lattice constant .",
    "the spatial width is merely limited by the distance to the next marker atom ( except if we want to perform the same rotation there ) .",
    "the principle of two qubit gates is already shown in fig .  [ distgate ] where in step @xmath10 we either perform a swap operation between register and marker atom , @xmath11 , or a phase gate , @xmath12 { \\vert \\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2\\rangle}$ ] where @xmath13 . as we will describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec5 ] , the phase gate as well as the swap gate are again based on the tunable molecular interaction between two atoms at one lattice site . in the first case",
    "the phase is acquired by a feshbach ramp which affects only the state @xmath14 while in the case of the swap gate we need , similar as in the case of the single qubit rotation , an additional laser field which couples resonantly the state which is shifted by the molecular interaction and the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the laser will again affect only the sites where two atoms are present thus again it does not have to be focused .    beside relaxing addressability constraints , our scheme bears several other advantages : for instance , it does not require a state - dependent lattice @xcite . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec1 ] that method has a couple of disadvantages and , furthermore , the realization and stabilization of such potentials poses a major experimental challenge . in our scheme",
    "the quantum register logical state never gets entangled with the atomic motion , eliminating a major source of decoherence .",
    "even collisional phases , acquired by the marker atom while being transported over occupied lattice sites , can be made state - insensitive by an appropriate choice of the atomic hyperfine states ( a typical example being rb , for which the singlet and the triplet scattering lengths coincide ) , thus contributing only a global phase to the evolution of the whole register .",
    "the transport scheme we describe in this section makes use of a time dependent optical superlattice configuration which can be far - offresonant from the relevant optical transition to avoid spontaneous emission and is not specialized to specific atomic species .",
    "the atom transport is independent of the considered internal states and allows for using the @xmath17 states of different hyperfine manifolds , i.e. states of a `` clock transition '' which are not affected by external magnetic fields .    in the following",
    "we will describe the laser configuration which is necessary to realize the superlattice and detail the transport of single atoms in the periodic potential by changing the intensities and phases of the lasers .",
    "we will furthermore discuss optimization methods .",
    "for the realization of the superlattice potential we propose using a configuration of four intersecting lasers like it was used in @xcite .",
    "the setup is shown in fig .",

    "we will assume in the following the confinement in the transverse directions @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be much stronger than along the @xmath21-direction so that we have effectively a one dimensional system .",

    "also shown in this figure by the dashed lines are the probability densities of the `` register atom '' @xmath87 , initially located in the ground state of the right well in this example and which is supposed to remain at its lattice site during the transport .",
    "our goal in the process described here is to transfer the left atom into the first excited state of the right well without affecting the other one .",
    "this can be accomplished by changing the parameters @xmath88 according to the following steps , which are illustrated in fig .",
