    "bell state measurement , or bell measurement , is an essential concept in quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "the most simple bell measurement scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.classicbellmeas ] .",
    "although this scheme is simple and instructive , it requires a nonlocal controlled - not ( cnot ) operation between the two qubits . a deterministic cnot operation and",
    "thus a complete bell measurement would be possible in various qubit systems where two qubits are situated close to each other . however , bell measurement between distant qubits is not possible using only local operation and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "more realistic implementations of bell measurement using linear optics @xcite are sometimes applied to various proof - of - principle demonstrations of quantum information protocols such as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping etc.@xcite , but it is known that they can not be complete and deterministic , i.e. , the linear - optical implementations can only partly distinguish among the four possible bell states @xcite .    in this letter , a simple scheme for complete and deterministic bell measurement is proposed .",
    "it consists of the measurements of _ nonlocal spin product operators _ , the members of nonlocal product observables @xcite , with the help of shared entanglement as a resource .",
    "the protocol enables nonlocal bell measurement between a pair of distant qubits .",
    "furthermore , not only bell measurement but also a complete bell filter is realizable , where the output state turns out to be either one of the bell states indicated by the measurement outcome .     , width=207 ]",
    "we consider a bipartite qubit system where a pair of qubits is distributed between alice and bob . in general , the state vector @xmath0 of the bipartite system is expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the eigenstate of the pauli operator @xmath5 on alice s ( bob s ) site having eigenvalues @xmath6 , @xmath7 . note that @xmath8 hereafter we sometimes write just @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the eigenvalues @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . for instance , @xmath13 also note that we regard the states @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the standard qubit representation , respectively .",
    "the bell bases are defined as @xmath18 using the bell bases , @xmath19 in ( [ eq.system ] ) is rewritten as @xmath20 where @xmath21 etc .",
    "the simple circuit for the bell measurement given in fig .  [ fig.classicbellmeas ] transforms the input states @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 into the output states @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "thus we can distinguish all the bell states by observing the local measurement outcomes on alice s and bob s qubits .",
    "however , as noted earlier , the simple scheme requires nonlocal cnot operation between distant qubits .",
    "nonlocal spin product operators , or nonlocal spin products , @xmath30 are expressed as @xmath31 where the first and second pauli operators act on alice s and bob s qubits , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath30 are @xmath32 and each of them is doubly degenerate .",
    "for instance , eigenvectors of @xmath33 for eigenvalues @xmath34 and @xmath12 are written as @xmath35 importantly , we find @xmath36 = 0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , for instance , @xmath33 commutes with @xmath37 . as a result , @xmath33 and @xmath37 are compatible having a complete orthonormal set of common eigenbases : @xmath38 where @xmath39 refers to the eigenvalue of @xmath37 .",
    "these are nothing other than the bell bases ( [ eq.bb1 ] ) and ( [ eq.bb2 ] ) .",
    "thus , by observing @xmath33 and @xmath37 for a given input state , we carry out a complete bell measurement .",
    "suppose alice and bob want to measure any nonlocal spin product @xmath30 for an arbitrary system state @xmath40 expressed in ( [ eq.system ] ) or ( [ eq.system2 ] ) . here , the suffix s after the state vector refers to the system to be measured .    measuring",
    "a component of @xmath30 is simple .",
    "since the measurements of @xmath41 by alice and @xmath42 by bob are compatible , we can make simultaneous local measurements of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and then compute the product of alice s and bob s outcomes to obtain the measurement result of @xmath30 .",
    "consider , for example , the measurement of @xmath33 .",
    "the measurement operators @xmath43 for the four possible combinations of alice s and bob s outcomes , @xmath44 , are the projective operators : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the projector to the state @xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding povm ( positive operator valued measure ) is @xmath48 .",
    "taking a product of @xmath49 and @xmath6 , we obtain the outcome @xmath50 for the measurement of @xmath33 .",
    "the povms @xmath51 for @xmath52 are obtained as @xmath53 we see that @xmath51 correspond to the projection to the eigenspaces of @xmath52 presented in ( [ eq.evzz1 ] ) and ( [ eq.evzz2 ] ) , respectively .    however , this local measurement strategy is inappropriate to make simultaneous measurements of two or more components of @xmath30 , for instance , @xmath33 and @xmath37 . since the above - mentioned measurement of @xmath33 projects the system state to either of the local product staltes @xmath26 , @xmath29 , @xmath28 or @xmath27 , the succeeding measurement of @xmath37 is no longer identical to that of the original input state . in other words ,",
    "the local projective measurement of @xmath5 on either alice s or bob s qubit is not compatible with @xmath37 .    .",
    "[ fig.nlmeas ] , height=136 ]    another strategy for the measurement of spin products is the _ nonlocal _ measurement making use of additional entanglement shared by alice and bob .",
    "suppose alice and bob share a maximally entangled bell state ( ebit ) : @xmath54 the suffix m indicates that it is used as a meter to measure the system state .",
    "alice and bob use each qubit in @xmath55 as a meter ( probe ) to measure their system qubit . to do so ,",
    "each of them makes a cnot gate between her / his qubits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.nlmeas ] , and then makes a projective @xmath5 measurement on her / his meter qubit . note that when her / his initial meter qubit was fixed as @xmath14 , the measurement would be the projective local measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "after the cnot gates , the initial state @xmath56 is converted to @xmath57 let alice s ( bob s ) outcome be @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the first term of the right hand side of ( [ eq.nlmeas1 ] ) corresponds to the case where the measurement outcome is @xmath60 or @xmath61 , while the second term to @xmath62 or @xmath63 . by simply taking a product of the local meter outcomes of alice and bob ,",
    "@xmath64 is obtained and thus the measurement of @xmath33 is complete .",
    "the measurement operators @xmath65 for @xmath52 are @xmath66 the corresponding povms are identical to that presented in ( [ eq.povm1 ] ) and ( [ eq.povm2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath65 project the system state to the eigenspaces of @xmath52 presented in ( [ eq.evzz1 ] ) and ( [ eq.evzz2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "note that the system state is still a superposition of @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , preserving sufficient information for the succeeding @xmath37 measurement .",
    "\\(a ) +   and @xmath37 . ( a ) with nonlocal @xmath33 and local @xmath37 measurements . ( b ) with nonlocal measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath37 .",

    "note that the scheme ( b ) acts as a complete bell filter .",
    "[ fig.bellmeas1 ] , title=\"fig:\",height=136 ]",
    "subsequent to the nonlocal measurement of @xmath33 described above , alice and bob make a @xmath37 measurement on the system state .",
    "as shown in ( [ eq.spb1 ] ) and ( [ eq.spb2 ] ) , the measurement of @xmath37 combined with @xmath33 discriminates @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23 from ( [ eq.nlmeas1 ] ) . in this way",
    ", a complete bell measurement can be carried out .    for the @xmath37 measurement , either local or nonlocal strategy can be used .",
    "if only the measurement outcome matters , the simple local strategy shown in fig .  [ fig.bellmeas1](a ) is appropriate . in this case , the povms @xmath67 , where suffixes @xmath50 and @xmath39 indicate the measurement outcomes of the preceding @xmath33 and the following @xmath37 , respectively , are written as @xmath68 on the other hand , if the system state at the output should be preserved in one of the resultant eigenstates given in ( [ eq.spb1 ] ) and ( [ eq.spb2 ] ) , i.e. , one of the bell bases , alice and bob can use nonlocal strategy at a cost of an additional ebit , as shown in fig .  [ fig.bellmeas1](b ) . in this case",
    ", the measurement operators @xmath69 are found to be @xmath70 again , the corresponding povms are identical to that presented in ( [ eq.povm3 ] ) and ( [ eq.povm4 ] ) .",
    "thus , the system state is projected into one of the bell basis depending on the measurement outcomes .",
    "this procedure functions as a complete _ bell filter _ , where the output state will be either one of the bell bases indicated by the measurement outcome .",
    "it is noteworthy that , in both strategies , all of the outcomes are deterministically obtained and thus the bell measurement proposed here is complete and deterministic , at the cost of requiring one ( for the bell measurement ) or two ( for the bell filter ) ebit(s ) as a resource .",
    "photon pairs are generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) so that their path qubits are entangled in @xmath71 .",
    "a polarization beamsplitter ( pbs ) works as a cnot gate between the polarization ( system ) and the path ( meter ) qubits .",
    "the outcomes of @xmath5 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 on alice s and bob s qubits , respectively ) are encoded in the output paths of pbs(z ) . after passing through the half - wave plate ( hwp ) , which acts as a hadamard gate ,",
    "the outcomes of @xmath72 ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) are encoded in the output paths of pbs(x ) .",
    "[ fig.photonicexp ] , height=188 ]",
    "the measurement schemes described above are applicable to any physical qubits between which we can prepare entanglement and a cnot operation . however , in cases where we can directly make a nonlocal cnot operation between qubits held in alice and bob , we could employ a simpler scheme as shown , for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig.classicbellmeas ] to implement the bell measurement .",
    "nevertheless , our scheme is still useful when we are not able to use nonlocal cnot , or when we need the function of the bell filter as well as the bell measurement .",
    "another situation where our schemes may be useful is the case of photonic qubits .",
    "it is known that with linear optics we can not implement deterministic cnot gates between individual photonic qubits @xcite . as a result , to date",
    ", we could not implement deterministic bell measurement with linear optics . nevertheless , employing the scheme described in this paper we will be able to implement the deterministic and complete bell measurement between photonic qubits .",
    "suppose we provide a pair of photons to alice and bob , ss shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.photonicexp ] .",
    "the photons polarizations constitute the system state @xmath40 of interest . in order to measure the nonlocal spin products on their polarizations ,",
    "we prepare their path degrees of freedom , i.e. , path qubits , in the maximally entangled bell state @xmath75 .",
    "entanglement in the path degrees of freedom could be directly generated by spatial entanglement between photons generated by parametric down - conversion @xcite , or could be converted from time - bin entanglement @xcite .",
    "when the polarization qubits are also entangled , it is called a hyperentangled state @xcite . between the polarization qubit and the path qubit , alice and",
    "bob employ cnot gates using polarizing beamsplitters ( pbs ) .",
    "thus , the nonlocal measurement of @xmath33 on the photons polarization qubits is implemented and the measurement outcomes are encoded in photons output paths .",
    "then alice and bob carry out the local @xmath72 measurement for their polarization qubits using , for instance , two additional pbss .",
    "this part implements the local measurement strategy of @xmath37 . at the last stage",
    ", alice detects her photon at one of her four output paths , as does bob at one of his four output paths . from the path information , they know the result of @xmath33 and @xmath37 , and thus the complete bell measurement is carried out in a deterministic way .",
    "one drawback of this linear optics implementation is that we use an ebit implemented in the path degree of freedom of the photon pair . as a result",
    ", it is difficult to apply this method to bell measurement between independent photons as in a case of quantum teleportation . nonetheless , this method will be useful in many situations of quantum technologies where nonlocal bell measurement is an essential resource .",
    "in this letter we see that complete and deterministic bell measurement is possible in terms of nonlocal spin product measurements .",
    "although the bell measurement requires an ebit as a resource , the scheme is readily realizable using present technologies .",
    "in particular , we propose an optical implementation using linear optics .",
    "in addition , a complete bell filter , which requires a couple of ebits and thus seems a bit more difficult to implement , is also possible .",
    "these schemes will be useful in quantum technologies where nonlocal bell measurement is indispensable .",
    "furthermore , the measurement protocol of nonlocal spin products can be extended to measurements at weak and any intermediate measurement strength @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be possible to realize generalized measurements of nonlocal spin products and bell measurement at any measurement strength . in this context",
    ", strength - variable measurements of photon polarization and the measurement uncertainty relations have been demonstrated @xcite . by extending the protocols described here",
    ", it would be possible to explore measurement uncertainty relations in the nonlocal product observables .",
