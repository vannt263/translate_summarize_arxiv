    "ferroelectric thin films are very good candidates for a wide range of applications : for example , as high - density dynamic random access memories , large - scale integrated capacitors , pyroelectric detectors , micro- and nanoelectromechanic devices @xcite .",
    "epitaxially grown thin films are usually highly constrained because their fabrication is accompanied by several strain factors originating due to lattice mismatch and the difference between the thermal - expansion coefficients of the film and the substrate .",
    "also , transformation strain usually appears at the ferroelectric phase transition if the heterostructure deposed at elevated temperatures is cooled below the curie temperature ( @xmath8).the importance of strain effects in determining the properties of thin - film ferroelectrics was recognized in numerous theoretical and experimental investigations @xcite .    the ba@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2 ( bst-@xmath3 ) solid solution is one of the most studied lead - free ferroelectric system from fundamental and technological point of view . in the paraelectric cubic phase ,",
    "the end - members batio@xmath2 ( bt ) and srtio@xmath2 ( st ) have similar crystal structure but exhibit quite different phase transition sequences on cooling .",
    "bt displays three phase transitions towards ferroelectric phases characterized by the polarization along different directions . on the other side ,",
    "st shows no ferroelectric phase transition on cooling but first an antiferrodistorsive transition followed by the appearance , at very low temperature , of a quantum paraelectric state . both bt and st compounds",
    "have been widely investigated , both theoretically and experimentally , whereas , the efforts on the bst-@xmath3 solid solution are mainly experimental .",
    "it is then very desirable to develop new calculation and theoretical tools that allow better and deeply describe the structure and thus the properties of this system .",
    "the temperature - concentration phase diagram of bulk bst-@xmath3 solid solutions based on the phenomenological six - order thermodynamic potential was recently developed @xcite and compared with available experimental data .",
    "thin films of bst-@xmath3 solid solutions are of great technological interest due to their excellent ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties . the structure and properties of ferroelectric thin films substantially differ from those of bulk ferroelectrics ; therefore , theoretical analysis is important since it can provide fundamental insights into the behavior of thin films .",
    "recently , ban and alpay @xcite have developed phase diagrams for single - domain epitaxial ba@xmath9sr@xmath10tio@xmath2 and ba@xmath11sr@xmath12tio@xmath2 films on ( 001 ) cubic substrates as a function of the misfit strain based on the landau - devonshire six - order potential as a polynomial of the polarization components in accordance with the one developed by pertsev @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the parameters used for the calculation of the renormalized coefficients for bst films were obtained by simple averaging the corresponding parameters of bt and st .",
    "it is worth noting that the contribution of six - order polarization terms to the free energy was neglected in their calculations that is rather oversimplified approach .",
    "however , as known from experimental investigations , high - order terms should be taken into account , because the two - dimensional clamping increases considerably the ferroelectric phase transition temperature in perovskite thin films .",
    "stress - induced upward shift in @xmath8 as large as tens of degrees have been observed @xcite . in this case , the coefficients at the sixth - order terms in the thermodynamic potential @xcite becomes negative , therefore , the six - order expansion is not valid for high - temperature phase transitions in thin films . very recently",
    "@xcite , the eighth - order landau - devonshire potential was used to construct `` misfit - temperature '' phase diagrams of epitaxial bt thin films on cubic substrates .",
    "the present paper is devoted to bst-@xmath3 thin films and is organized as follows .",
    "first , we develop thermodynamic potential for bst-@xmath3 solid solutions using phenomenological models known for pure bt and st single crystals . due to",
    "the above mentioned reason the sixth - order potential for bst solid solutions used in @xcite is not valid for thin films , therefore here we use eighth - order potential developed by li @xcite for bt single crystal and fourth - order potential recently developed for st crystal @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in @xcite the coefficient at @xmath15 in the potential for st was changed considerably to achieve agreement between experimental data @xcite and para - ferroelectric transition line on the theoretical phase diagram . as a result",
    ", the value of the susceptibility was found to be significantly and abnormally large with respect to the experimentally observed one . in the present work we use coefficients of thermodynamic potential for st @xcite and bt @xcite .",
    "moreover , several coefficients ( q@xmath16 , q@xmath17 , @xmath18 ) from @xcite were changed to get better agreement with experimental diagram in the ba - rich side .",
    "second , we develop thermodynamic potential for bst thin film epitaxially grown on cubic substrate . the potential derived for bst solid solutions according to the method proposed in @xcite",
    "includes no term associated with thermal expansion . to take into account thermal expansion",
    "the above method was modified with the aim to include evidently relevant term in the potential .",
    "finally , the resulting potential was used to construct according to the conventional way @xcite the `` misfit - temperature '' diagrams for thin films of particular bst-@xmath3 compositions .",
    "following the method developed in @xcite the helmholtz thermodynamic potential of the solid solution can be written using the known thermodynamic potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 for end members of the solid solution @xmath21 ( st ) and @xmath22 ( bt ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the order parameter,@xmath25 is the common elastic strain of the solid solution , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are lattice strains of the end members , needed to fit the lattice parameter st , bt and bst-@xmath3 @xcite .",

    "finally , we compare our phase diagram for pure st film ( @xmath3=0 ) with those developed by pertsev @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "although phase diagrams have similar overall view for @xmath223 , some important differences caused by the above discussed changes of the coefficients should be emphasized . as shown in fig.4",
    ", additional phase * 32 * exists in between * 21*(foii ) and * 15*(foiv ) phases .",
    "we have to emphasize that foiv phase determined as @xmath224 and @xmath225 ( ref .",
    "24 ) actually contains two different phases * 15 * and * 17 * listed in table ii .",
    "note , that ferroelectric ( fti ) tetragonal phase * 1 * @xmath226 predicted in ref .",
    "27 for negative misfit strains and @xmath227200 k , according to our calculations is stable at low temperatures only ( see fig .",
    "also , phase * 15*(foiv ) exists in the limited misfit interval .",
    "it is worth noting that in pure st many phases are stable in the narrow intervals near @xmath122= 0 .",
    "therefore , even weak clamping of single - crystalline plates , usually used for low - temperature measurements , can induce phase transition to one of the low - symmetry phases .    concluding this section we have to emphasize some limitations of the above developed approach .",
    "the phenomenological potential of the solid solution ( 1 ) was written through the potentials of its end members ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "therefore the validity of the potential ( 1 ) is based on validity of the potentials for each member of the solid solution .",
    "the method used to develop the potential ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is based on the macroscopic theory of elasticity and crystal lattice matching .",
    "we assume that solid solution with no ordering in the whole concentration range can be correctly described if ionic substitution induces geometrical distortions , accompanied by the macroscopic elastic deformation @xcite .",
    "we also assume that isomorphic ba / sr substitution does not change the type of chemical bonding . therefore , in our model , most ( or even all ) changes in the solid solution are caused by the elastic interaction .",
    "actually , currently available potentials for both end - members of bst solid solution require further improvements .",
    "some coefficients for fourth - order potential developed by uwe @xcite for st were recently revised @xcite .",
    "although some uncertainty in the values of the coefficients still exists , reasonable agreement with the available experimental data were found @xcite .",
    "further investigations and new perfect experimental data will require extension of the theory to the higher orders @xcite .",
    "two eight - order potentials are currently available for bt .",
    "li et al @xcite developed a model with only a single temperature - dependent second - order coefficient , while all higher - order coefficients were temperature - independent .",
    "this model could successfully reproduce the phase transition temperatures and their dependence on electric fields , as well as the dielectric and piezoelectric constants of bulk bt . recently , wang et al @xcite developed potential where forth - order coefficients were also temperature - dependent and successfully explained dielectric properties of bt .",
    "although the latter potential looks much more attractive , we failed to employ it in our model for bst solid solution .",
    "since elastic properties of the potential are very important in our model , we have analyzed the temperature - hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath229 ) phase diagram using potential @xcite .",
    "we found that the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transition temperature decreases with increasing pressure , approaches the minimum , then increases , and finally decreases again .",
    "such a behavior contradicts to the experiment @xcite .",
    "although the potential developed by li @xcite does not reproduces exactly the experimental @xmath229 phase diagram , a disagreement is not so pronounced .",
    "very likely , as was noted in ref .",
    "31 , additional terms should be considered in the potential to describe large deformations .",
    "to construct the `` concentration - misfit strain '' and `` temperature- misfit strain '' phase diagrams of epitaxial bst-@xmath3 thin films on ( 001)-oriented cubic substrates we modified thermodynamic potential for bulk bst-@xmath3 solid solutions developed in ref .",
    "the thermal expansion , missing in the previous thermodynamic model @xcite was simply introduced in the helmholtz potential ( 1 ) by the shift of the common strain @xmath25 of the solid solution on the value of the linear thermal expansion .",
    "the introduced modification does not change the phase diagram of bulk bst-@xmath3 solid solution , and allows ones to develop thermodynamic theory for thin films .    in the present work we used eighth - order thermodynamic potential for bt single crystal @xcite and fourth - order potential for st single crystal @xcite to develop relevant potential of bst-@xmath3 solid solution , which can be applied at high temperatures .    in order to fit the phase transition lines to experimentally measured phase diagram of bst-@xmath3 solid solutions @xcite , the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath97 in six - order term in the potential of bt were changed .",
    "also , the stable thermodynamic states and phase transitions lines in the concentration range @xmath230 were calculated .",
    "five low - symmetry phases are predicted for bulk solid solution in the narrow concentration interval around multiphase point t@xmath231 = 48 k , @xmath3 = 0.029 as shown in fig .",
    "performing the necessary calculations , we constructed the room - temperature `` concentration- misfit strain '' @xmath232 phase diagram for bst-@xmath3 thin films epitaxially grown on cubic substrate .",
    "the diagram is useful for practical applications in thin - film engineering .",
    "depending on the type of strain imposed by the substrate , epitaxial bst-@xmath3 thin films can be grown with the polarization either normal or parallel to the substrate . as follows from the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "3 , ferroelectric state with the polarization parallel to the substrate is only possible is st films deposited on tensile substrates .",
    "recently @xcite , room - temperature ferroelectricity was observed in st films on dysco@xmath2 substrates .",
    "the tensile lattice mismatch in this heterostructure at room temperature is about 1% that is very close to the * 0 * -*3 * phase transition line in fig .",
    "3 .    a rich variety of low - symmetry phases induced by octahedral tilting and ionic displacements are allowed near the @xmath109-phase point @xmath233 k ) .",
    "most of them are stable in the narrow temperature intervals near @xmath122= 0 . great difference between the phase transition sequence in bulk bst-@xmath3 and epitaxial thin films with the composition around @xmath3 = 0.029 can be therefore expected .",
    "the selection of the substrate and the film composition allow manipulating the strain state in the film to achieve the desirable phase transition sequence ."
