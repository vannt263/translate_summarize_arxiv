    "this article is about a tensor - hom like duality for a specific graph construction that will be called the _ cylindrical construction_. strictly speaking , the construction can be described as replacement of edges of a graph by some other graph(s ) ( here called cylinders ) , where many different variants of this construction can be found within the vast literature of graph theory ( e.g. pultr templates @xcite and replacement @xcite ) . as our primary motivation for this construction was related to introducing a cobordism theory for graphs and was initiated through algorithmic problems , we present a general form of this edge - replacement construction in which there also may be some twists at each terminal end ( here called bases ) of these cylinders . in secion",
    "[ sec : cylconst ] we show how this general construction and its dual almost cover most well - known graph constructions .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the role of twists in this construction is fundamental and may give rise to new constructs and results ( e.g. see sections  [ sec : cylconst ] for @xmath0-lifts as cylindrical constructions by identity cylinders and note a recent breakthrough of a.w.marcus , d.a.spielman and n.srivastava @xcite and references therein for the background ) .    in section  [ sec : basics ]",
    "we go through the basic definitions and notations we will be needing hereafter .",
    "an important part of this framework is going through the definitions of different categories of graphs and the pushout construction in them , where we discuss some subtleties related to the existence of pushouts in different setups in the appendix of this article for completeness .    in sections  [ sec : cylconst ] we introduce the main construction and its dual , in which we go through the details of expressing many different well - known graph constructions as a cylindrical product or its dual . in this section",
    "we have tried to avoid being formal and have described the constructions in detail from the scratch using a variant of examples for clarification .    in sections  [ sec : main ] and [ sec : cat ] we state the main duality result and some categorical perspective showing the naturality of definitions .",
    "there are related results to reductions for the graph homomorphism problem that will be considered in section  [ sec : adjred ] .",
    "other applications of this construction will appear elsewhere .",
    "in this section we go through some basic definitions and will set the notations for what will appear in the rest of the article . throughout the paper ,",

    "similarly , the vertex @xmath35 is called the _ terminal vertex of @xmath33 _ and may be denoted by @xmath36 . in this setting , when there is no ambiguity , the edge @xmath33 is sometimes referred to by the notation @xmath37 .",
    "also , we say that an edge @xmath33 intersects a vertex @xmath38 if @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "hereafter , we may freely refer to an edge @xmath37 when the corresponding data is clear from the context .",
    "the _ reduced part _ of a graph @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath41 , is the graph obtained by excluding all isolated vertices of @xmath2 .",

    "* marked graphs * + let @xmath62 and @xmath2 be a set and a graph , respectively , and also , consider a one - to - one map @xmath63 .",
    "evidently , one can consider @xmath64 as a graph monomorphism from the empty graph @xmath65 on the vertex set @xmath43 to the graph @xmath2 , where in this setting we interpret the situation as _ marking _ some vertices of @xmath2 by the elements of @xmath43 .",
    "the data introduced by the pair @xmath66 is called a _ marked graph _ @xmath2 marked by the set @xmath43 through the map @xmath64 .",
    "note that ( by abuse of language ) we may introduce the corresponding marked graph as @xmath67 when the definition of @xmath64 ( especially its range ) is clear from the context ( for examples see figures  [ fig : amalgam]@xmath68 and  [ fig : amalgam]@xmath69 ) .",
    "also , ( by abuse of language ) we may refer to _ the vertex @xmath70 _ as the vertex @xmath71 .",
    "this is most natural when @xmath42 and vertices in @xmath43 are marked by the corresponding elements in @xmath27 through the identity mapping .",
    "if @xmath72 is a ( not necessarily one - to - one ) map , then one can obtain a new marked graph @xmath73 by considering the pushout of the diagram @xmath74 in the category of graphs .",
    "it is well - known that in * grph * the pushout exists and is a monomorphism ( e.g. figure  [ fig : amalgam]@xmath75 presents such a pushout ( i.e. amalgam ) of marked graphs [ fig : amalgam]@xmath68 and [ fig : amalgam]@xmath69 ) .",
    "also , it is easy to see that the new marked graph @xmath76 can be obtained from @xmath66 by identifying the vertices in each inverse - image of @xmath77 . hence , again we may denote @xmath76 as @xmath78 , where we allow repetition in the list appearing in the brackets .",
    "note that , with this notation , one may interpret @xmath70 s as a set of _ variables _ in the _ graph structure _ @xmath67 , such that when one assigns other ( new and not necessarily distinct ) _ values _ to these variables one can obtain some other graphs ( by identification of vertices ) ( e.g. see figure  [ fig : amalgam]@xmath79 ) .    on the other hand , given two marked graphs @xmath66 and @xmath76 with @xmath80 one can construct their amalgam @xmath81 by forming the pushout of the following diagram , @xmath82 in which @xmath83 is a graph structure induced on @xmath84 indicating the way edges should be identified in this amalgam such that one can define the extensions @xmath85 and @xmath86 as graph homomorphisms ( note that pushouts exist in the category of graphs and can be constructed as pushouts of the vertex set and the edge set naturally . for more details see the appendix ) . following our previous notations",
    "we may denote the new structure by @xmath87 if there is no confusion about the definition of mappings ( in what follows the maps @xmath88 and @xmath89 are embeddings of a subgraph on @xmath90 ) .",
    "note that when @xmath90 is the empty set , then the amalgam is the _ disjoint union _ of the two marked graphs .",
    "also , by the universal property of the pushout diagram , the amalgam can be considered as marked graphs marked by @xmath43 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath90 .",
    "sometimes it is preferred to partition the list of variables in a graph structure as , @xmath93 in these cases we may either use bold symbols for an ordered list of variables and write this graph structure as @xmath94 ( if there is no confusion about the size of the lists ) , or we may simply write @xmath95 it is understood that a repeated appearance of a graph structure in an expression as @xmath96 is always considered as different isomorphic copies of the structure marked properly by the indicated labels ( e.g. @xmath96 is an amalgam constructed by two different isomorphic copies of @xmath97 identified on the vertex @xmath98 where the vertex @xmath99 in one of these copies is marked ) .    by @xmath100 we mean a @xmath0-clique on @xmath101 marked by its own set of vertices .",
    "specially , a single edge is denoted by @xmath102 ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) .",
    "we use the notation @xmath104 $ ] for the induced subgraph on vertices of @xmath2 labeled by @xmath5 .",

    "hence , we treat all graphs labeled by a set of just one element , as _ ordinary _ ( i.e. not labeled ) graphs . also , it is instructive to note that the concept of a labeled graph and the category @xmath116 has a central importance in the whole world of combinatorial objects ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , a _ labeled marked graph _",
    "@xmath118 , in which vertices are marked by the set @xmath43 and the edges are labeled by the set @xmath119 , consists of the data @xmath120 where @xmath66 is a marked @xmath121-graph equipped with the labeling @xmath122 of its edges ( e.g. see figure  [ fig : amalgam]@xmath123 ) .",
    "again , given two labeled marked graphs @xmath124 one may consider these graphs as @xmath125-labeled marked graphs and consider the pushout of diagram  [ diag : amalgam ] in @xmath116 , which exists when , intuitively , the @xmath125-labeled marked graph obtained by identifying vertices in @xmath90 can be constructed by assigning the common labels of the overlapping edges in the intersection ( i.e. the labels of overlapping edges must be compatible ) .",
    "this graph amalgam will be denoted in a concise form ( when there is no confusion ) by @xmath126    [ def : symgraph ] a labeled graph @xmath127 is said to be _ symmetric _ if there is a one to one correspondence between the labeled edges @xmath37 and @xmath128 that preserves the labeling ( see figure [ fig : simple]@xmath68 ) . if for any two vertices @xmath38 and @xmath98 there only exist two edges @xmath37 and @xmath128 with the same label then the graph is said to be _ simply symmetric _",
    "( see figure [ fig : simple]@xmath69 ) .",
    "clearly , the data available in the structure of a simply symmetric graph can be encoded in a structure on the same set of vertices for which an edge is a subset of @xmath129 of size two ( note that for loops we correspond two directed loops to a simple loop ) , while in this case the new structure may be called the corresponding _ generalized simple _ graph ( see figure [ fig : simple]@xmath75 ) .    since usually in graph theory _",

    "* serre - stallings category of graphs , @xmath496 * + this is a category of graphs usually used in algebraic topology and dates back at least to the contributions of serre and stallings @xcite where the existence of pushouts in this category was first addressed in @xcite",
    ".    the category is denoted by @xmath496 and a graph @xmath497 is an object of this category with two sets @xmath129 ( containing vertices ) and @xmath498 ( containing edges ) , and two functions @xmath499 and @xmath500 . for each edge @xmath501",
    ", there is an inverse edge @xmath502 , and an initial vertex @xmath503 where the terminal vertex defined as @xmath504 satisfying @xmath505 and @xmath506 .",
    "if one fixes orientations for graphs @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( i.e. choosing just one edge from any pair @xmath513 ) and call the corresponding directed graphs @xmath514 and @xmath515 , respectively , then assuming the existence of an ordinary directed graph homomorphism from @xmath514 to @xmath515 , then clearly , one can canonically construct a graph homomorphism from @xmath2 to @xmath3 in @xmath496 . hence",
    ", if there exists orientations for @xmath516-graphs @xmath517 and @xmath518 such that two graph homomorphisms @xmath519 and @xmath520 preserve the corresponding orientations , then their pushout exists .    by @xcite for two graph homomorphisms @xmath519 and @xmath520 in @xmath496 , their pushout exists , if and only if there exists orientations for @xmath517 and @xmath518 such that @xmath521 and @xmath314 preserve such orientations .",
    "[ pushout ] * non - existence of pushout in @xmath496 * + consider @xmath522 and @xmath523 .",
    "we mark vertices of @xmath2 with @xmath524 and vertices of @xmath525 by @xmath526 in a circular configuration ( see figure [ fig : push ] ) .",
    "now , let @xmath527 @xmath528 where edges are mapped canonically ( see figure [ fig : push ] ) .",
    "we claim that we ca nt find orientations for @xmath2 , @xmath529 and @xmath518 which preserved by @xmath521 and @xmath314 . to see this ,",
    "assume that we have orientations @xmath530 and @xmath531 preserved by @xmath521 and @xmath314 .",
    "we write @xmath532 , if the orientation of the edge @xmath533 in @xmath534 is from @xmath535 to @xmath536 in @xmath537 and @xmath538 vice versa .      on the other hand",
    ", one can see that if there exists a pushout object @xmath541 , then @xmath542 @xmath543 hence , by commutativity of the pushout diagram we should have @xmath544 , hence @xmath545 .",
    "but since the graph homomorphisms should preserve structure , we should also have @xmath546 which is a contradiction since we have a rule in @xmath496 indicating that @xmath547 .",
    "note that it is straight forward to verify that pushouts exist in @xmath54 and @xmath130 , since each homomorphism can be decomposed into vertex and edge maps for which the pushout exist and are compatible .",
    "hence , the pushout of @xmath521 and @xmath314 in the above example exists and is equal to a simple loop .",
    "also , let @xmath548 be a the subcategory of @xmath54 whose objects are as those of @xmath496 .",
    "then , it is not hard to see that the pushout of @xmath521 and @xmath314 in example  [ pushout ] does nt exists in @xmath548 , either .",
    "this can be verified since the pushout object , if it would have existed , should have been a single vertex with two directed loops @xmath549 , where the image of @xmath550 and @xmath551 must be a singleton and without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath552 . therefore ,",
    "considering two pushout objects ( cones ) @xmath553 and @xmath554 for which the image of @xmath555 and @xmath556 is a single loop which we denote by @xmath557 .",
    "hence , we have two homomorphisms @xmath558 , where @xmath559 both @xmath560 and @xmath22 satisfying the pushout diagram commutativity condition which is a contradiction .       let @xmath561 be the forgetful functor , that sends each ( directed ) graph to its corresponding simple graph",
    ". then @xmath562 is bijective on objects , but is not faithful on objects endowed with loops or multiple edges ."
