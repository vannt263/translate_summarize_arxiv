    "the application of pqcd approach to many channels involving the s - wave mesons is successful .",

    "up to now , this approach is only at the leading order in @xmath1 expansion , without the next - to - leading order corrections .",
    "since the scalar glueball is not very light , the power corrections proportional to @xmath167 may also be important .",
    "moreover although this approach has been proved for the @xmath168 form factor  @xcite , there is no proof for the factorization of the @xmath0-to - glueball form factor and this may introduce some potential uncertainties .",
    "* the hadronic inputs give another origin of the uncertainties .",
    "the decay constant @xmath75 of a scalar glueball may introduce sizable uncertainties ( roughly @xmath169 ) . since there is not any theoretical study on the lcda of scalar glueball , the higher but unknown gegenbauer moments in the lcda",
    "may also provide sizable contributions .",
    "* in the presence of mixing , the uncertainties from ordinary scalar mesons also affect the production rates of scalar glueballs sizably .",
    "for example in the two different scenarios for scalar mesons , the form factors for the quark states even have different signs , because of the different signs in the decay constants of ordinary scalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the interference between quark content and gluon content differs in signs in the two scenarios .",
    "moreover , the magnitudes of decay constants could also suffer from large ambiguities .",

    "based on the two - quark assumption for the @xmath170 meson , the early study in the qcd sum rule  @xcite gives @xmath171 while the recent study  @xcite predicts two sets of values @xmath172,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the scale @xmath173gev ( @xmath174gev ) .",
    "the decay constants for the isosinglet mesons near 1.5 gev may also suffer from similar uncertainties and the interference between different components will be complicated .",
    "these quantities will inevitably affect the production rates of scalar mesons , and the extraction of the mixing matrix will require more precise , both experimental and theoretical , studies .",
    "for example , the experimental study on semileptonic @xmath175 decays is helpful to constrain the contributions from the quark content . on the theoretical side uncertainties caused by the hadronic inputs",
    "could be reduced in a systematic and comprehensive study on the ordinary scalar meson and the glueball state .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work and will be reported elsewhere .      in ref .",

    "the relevant wilson coefficient is small and the result is sensitive to the next - to - leading order correction and/or the potential new physics effect .",
    "hadronic uncertainties are also typically large in nonleptonic decays .",

    ", we can see that albeit the production rates of a glueball state in semileptonic @xmath0 decays are not very large , the chosen channels @xmath125 and @xmath4 are easily measured and rather clean . in inclusive decays @xmath176 decays , it is almost impossible to study the mixing between ordinary scalar mesons and a glueball state .",

    "[ diagram : feynbtof0d ] . thus the mixing coefficients can also be determined if these two channels are experimentally measured .",
    "it is necessary to point out that this method may suffer from sizable uncertainties of annihilation diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the ordinary light scalar meson is isospin singlet and/or flavor su(3 ) singlet , while the glueball is flavor su(6 ) singlet .",
    "therefore it is difficult to distinguish them by the light @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 quark coupling .",
    "the light ordinary scalar meson has negligible @xmath20 component , while the glueball have the same coupling to @xmath20 as that to the @xmath21 , @xmath196 or @xmath197 .",
    "a clean way to identify a glueball is then through the @xmath20 coupling to the glueball .    in @xmath0",
    "decays , the initial heavy meson contains a light quark , thus contributions of the gluon component always accompany with the quark content @xmath148 or @xmath149 .",
    "it is not easy to isolate the gluon content .",

    "the observation of this decay channel in the experiments will surely establish the existence of a scalar glueball .",
    "moreover the ckm matrix element in this channel is @xmath199 , thus the @xmath200 will have a sizable branching ratio .",
    "this channel will depend on the @xmath201 transition form factor which requires the less - constrained @xmath6 meson s light - cone distribution amplitude .",
    "but even if we assume the form factor of @xmath201 is smaller than the @xmath202 form factor by one order , branching ratios of @xmath203 are suppressed by two orders @xmath204 where the branching ratio of @xmath205 has been taken as @xmath206 .",
    "although more quantitative results need the precise @xmath201 form factors , which requires the @xmath6 wave function with large uncertainties , the order of magnitude of branching ratio is convincing .",
    "this branching ratio is large enough for the experiments .",
    "one only needs to reconstruct the @xmath207 scalar meson in the final state and also the @xmath6 meson mass in the intermediate state , so that to make sure that the scalar meson is produced from two gluons .",
    "that experiment is achievable even if the @xmath207 meson is not a pure glueball , but at least has a large portion of it .",
    "the disadvantage here is the missing neutrino in detector is hard to be reconstructed in hadronic machines , like lhcb .",
    "a future z factory is an ideal place for this channel to be measured @xcite .",
    "@xmath208 is another potential mode to figure out the gluon content .",
    "but in this mode , the @xmath148 component also contributes through the annihilation diagrams .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath209 quark annihilates and the @xmath18 and @xmath210 quark are created . the ckm matrix element @xmath199 and",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath144 are the same with the emission diagram for the @xmath6-to - glueball transition .",
    "the offshellnes of the two internal particles in annihilation diagrams are of the order @xmath211 .",
    "the electroweak vertex is the @xmath212 type and the decay amplitude is proportional to the light quark mass .",
    "thus the decay amplitudes via annihilation diagram for the @xmath148 component are expected to be suppressed . as a result , the @xmath208 also filters out the gluon component of the scalar meson as an approximation .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the transition form factors of @xmath0 meson decays into a scalar glueball state in the pqcd approach .",
    "compared with the form factors for the quark content , we find that form factors for the gluon content have the same power counting in the expansion of @xmath213 but they are numerically a little smaller .",
    "the pure glueball states can be detected in semileptonic @xmath2 and @xmath4 in the future , since they have a sizeable branching ratio .",
    "if a scalar meson is a mixture of a glueball and an ordinary meson , we investigate the possibility to extract the mixing mechanism from semileptonic @xmath0 decays , such as @xmath214 and @xmath215 decays .",
    "the nonleptonic @xmath180 and @xmath216 decays are also analyzed . to be specific , we discussed the production rates of scalar mesons under two different mixing mechanisms , and we find that the differences in @xmath0 and @xmath99 decays are helpful to distinguish the two mixing mechanisms . to avoid the interference between the quark and the gluon component , we find that the @xmath217 and @xmath208 will project out the gluon component of a scalar meson cleanly .",
