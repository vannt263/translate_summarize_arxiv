    "a classic example of a strictly self - similar fractal that can be constructed by iterated function system is the cantor set @xcite .",

    "thus if we iterate the map @xmath12 infinitely many times this will result in the well known cantor set ; see figure [ fr1 ] .",
    "this iteration procedure can be generalised by the following theorem @xcite :    [ th1 ] if we have @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 , then @xmath16 unique non - empty set @xmath17 @xmath18 , hence invariant for the map @xmath12 and @xmath19    ( 140,70)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) and @xmath20 on the interval @xmath21 that result in the canator set , where the left and right arrows represent @xmath22 and @xmath20 , respectively . on the right hand side of the intervals , the corresponding iterations of the map @xmath12 and the number of the intervals of the particular iteration are shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    using a polygon as an initial set for fractal generation is a well known technique since the most famous strictly self - similar fractal examples , the cantor set and the sierpinski triangle , consist of infinitely many line - segments and triangles , respectively . in the present paper",
    "the number of the vertices of the polygon will be increased to an arbitrary number @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the fractal can consist of infinitely many pentagrams , hexagons , etc .",
    "furthermore , the building regular polygons will be all @xmath24 star - polygons @xcite where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . for our purpose",
    "we will take the unit circle and it will be divided in @xmath0 equal segments .",
    "for example , in the case of pentagram , we have @xmath29 which gives us @xmath30-polygon .",
    "once we choose an @xmath24-polygon it can be scaled by a factor of @xmath31 with respect to all of the vertices of the polygon .",
    "this will produce @xmath0 new polygons similar to the initial one but scaled down by factor of @xmath32 .",
    "now , if we repeat the procedure for each one of these new polygons , another @xmath33 polygons will be created that will be @xmath34 times smaller than the initial @xmath24-polygon inscribed in the unit circle . if the @xmath32 is chosen carefully , after infinitely many contractions , the result will be a strictly self - similar fractal composed by non - intersecting polygons .",
    "thus , at the @xmath35-th contraction the defined @xmath0 contracting maps are applied @xmath36 times , and by theorem [ th1 ] when @xmath37 we will define infinitely many points of attraction .",
    "these points of attraction specify the attractor of the iteration procedure .",
    "this polygonal attractor is a fractal produced by the infinite contractions ( @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ) of the initial polygon and it is self similar , i.e. it is composed of infinitely many polygons similar to the initial one .",
    "the present study is focused on non - self - intersecting fractals where the scaled copies of the initial polygons osculate with each other .",
    "this restricts the possibilities for @xmath32 when sierpinsky @xmath0-gon @xcite for arbitrary @xmath0 is constructed and a formula about @xmath32 is derived .",
    "this important ratio is reported in two other places @xcite and @xcite where in the latter the proof is omitted . moreover , in both manuscripts the authors did not prove that the hausdorff dimension of the non - self - intersecting @xmath1-gon is 1 . in the present paper , an original derivation of the equation for the scaling ratio @xmath32 is presented .",
    "it is done in a very detailed way by using simple geometric laws which makes the result affordable even for high - school students .",
    "also , the hausdorff dimension of the @xmath1-gon is shown to be 1 .",
    "furthermore , universal constructions for @xmath0-flakes are proposed for the cases when @xmath0 is even or odd , and the hausdorff dimension of the @xmath1-flake is proved to be 2 . to this end",
    ", formulas for the scaling ratio and the rotation of the central polygon of the @xmath0-flake are derived , which to the knowledge of the author have not been reported previously .",
    "finally , it is shown that different initial polygons may result in an identical attractor when an ifs iteration scheme is applied and it is shown which are the main parameters that define the shape of the sierpinski @xmath0-gon and the polyflake attractors .    the paper is constructed as follows : in section [ sec2 ] the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath38 are introduced and an important equation for the ratio @xmath39 is derived . in section [ sec3 ] a condition for @xmath38",
    "is obtained that ensures no self - intersection of the studied class of fractals .",
    "then , two techniques for imaging ifs attractors are introduced and several sierpinsky @xmath0-gons are computed together with their dimensions . in section [ sec4 ] the possibility for additional scaling map that scales down towards the centre of the polygon is taken into account .",
    "different constructions for the cases when @xmath0 is odd or even are proposed so the resulted @xmath0-flake to be non - self - intersecting for arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "also , a few interesting examples are given and the hausdorff dimension of the @xmath1-flake is computed . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "some well known fractals are shown to be a special case of the fractal generation scheme shown here .",
    "it is also explained why identical attractors may originate from different star - polygons and how we can exploit this feature .",
    "an important result of the present paper will be explained in this section . here",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath32 will be deduced from @xmath0 and @xmath38 .",

    "although , it has @xmath96 vertices , it must be considered as @xmath97 star - polygon , because we will only use geometrical properties that are independent of @xmath0 and @xmath38 . for this purpose we must find out the following angles : @xmath98 and @xmath99    ( 140,80)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) together with the scaled down polygon towards the @xmath81 vertex ( in red ) and its mirror image across the line @xmath100 ( in blue ) which is equivalent to the scaled down polygon towards the @xmath80 vertex.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we already found that @xmath101 and therefore + @xmath102 @xmath103 + @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath103 + @xmath103 @xmath105 . on the other hand due to the symmetry of the scaled polygon ( in red ) @xmath106 since @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "this is true because the @xmath100 represents an axis of symmetry for the initial polygon and it contains point @xmath46 which is a common point for both the scaled polygons towards the @xmath80 and @xmath81 vertices .",

    "equations ( [ eq3 ] ) clearly show that @xmath125 , when @xmath117 divides @xmath0 without residual , which ensures the unique definition of @xmath88 when the resulted fractals are non - self - intersecting .",

    "all the figures above were drawn by using a random walk generator that draws points which lie in the ifs attractor @xcite .",

    "however , the attractors of the special cases mentioned above do not originate from an unique star - polygons because if we generate random points on the attractor of the ifs , the image is defined by the maps @xmath298 ; see theorem [ th1 ] . therefore",
    ", if we do not alter @xmath32 and @xmath0 , the ifs - attractors with any initial @xmath299-polygon will be the same .",

    "let us denote this figure as @xmath305-star polygon .",
    "as the @xmath305-polygon is inscribed in all the @xmath306-polygons we can generalise that any attractor that originates from a \\{n , m}-polygon is equivalent to the attractor of the ifs that originates from the \\{n , n/2}-polygon where the ratios and the rotations of the maps @xmath307 are kept the same as the ones used for the ifs of the \\{n , m}-polygon .",

    "[ ex13 ] if the fractal figure [ fr21](d ) is infinitely iterated the attractor will have hausdorff dimension : @xmath311\\approx1.8879 $ ]    unlike the cases of @xmath312 and @xmath96 , where the @xmath313 $ ] is a non - self intersecting fractal with the copies of the initial @xmath314-polygon osculating with each other , for @xmath266 when @xmath315 , the scaled copies stop osculating and with the increase of the iterations they do not fill up the space in the most effective way .",
    "the same effect appears when we take @xmath316 $ ] for @xmath265 when @xmath317 .",
    "thus , the problem of finding scaling ratio for the @xmath178 for every @xmath317 where the rotation of @xmath178 is equal to @xmath189 stays as an open problem .",
    "this is an important question due to the fact that the fractals that originate from an @xmath0-gon with rotation of @xmath178 equal to @xmath189 could have dimensions very close or equal to 2 ; see examples [ ex8 ] and [ ex9 ] .",
    "the present paper develops a universal technique that allows any star - polygon to be used for the construction of non - self intersecting fractal ( sierpinski @xmath0-gon or @xmath0-flake ) by using ifs through random walk or through an exact scaling . along the proposed scaling ratios ,",
    "the matlab code for ifs random walk fractal generation is provided so that someone interested in studying the geometry of this class of fractals could use it .",
    "important dimensions are computed , namely the dimension of the sierpinki @xmath1-gon is proved to be 1 , the dimension of the @xmath1-flake to be 2 , and the dimension of @xmath318 $ ] to be 2 as well .",
    "it is also shown , that by using random walk ifs generator , identical attractors may result from different initial star - polygons .",
    "the proposed study can be extended if rotations are applied not only to the @xmath178 map , but to the @xmath130 maps as well .",
    "however , this is still an ongoing research in development .",
    "the techniques for construction and the provided ratios needed for the dimensions of the presented class of fractals is important not only for mathematicians , but also for engineers and other scientists who may be interested in fractal - shaped devices or who study the fractal shapes of nature . with the advanced precision of the fabrication technology polyflakes",
    "may become an important design for devices such as antennas or chemical mixers for fuel cells , batteries , etc .",
    "also , fractal shapes are applicable in any kind of wave absorbers where the wave could be a sound wave , electromagnetic signal , light , caused by turbulent flow , etc . in other words ,",
