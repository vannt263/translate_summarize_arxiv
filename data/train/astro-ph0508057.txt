    "a model was proposed at the vatican conference on stellar populations ( oconnell 1958 ) to explain the period - ratio dichotomy in globular cluster rr lyrae variables , studied by oosterhoff ( 1939 , 1944 ) , following its discovery by grosse ( 1932 ) and hachenberg ( 1939 ) .",
    "the postulate of the model was that the difference in the observed mean periods between the two oosterhoff groups could be understood if the absolute magnitude levels of the groups differed by @xmath90.2 mag at constant temperature , the variables in the long period group being brighter ( sandage 1958 ) . in the discussion ,",
    "martin schwarzschild ( 1958 ) asked if , instead , the period ratio could be explained by a temperature difference with the long period group ( oost ii ) being cooler on average than oosterhoff i clusters , keeping the luminosities the same .",
    "i replied that a color shift would have to be at the level of 0.09 mag in b - v toward the red in the long period oosterhoff group .",
    "although a later calculation ( sandage 1993b , hereafter s93b , footnote 1 ) gave 0.06 mag for the required color shift , both 0.06 and 0.09 mag were outside the bounds permitted by the observations of clusters in the two oosterhoff period groups known at the time for m3 and m92 ( arp , baum , and sandage 1953 , sandage 1953 ) and for five other clusters ( arp 1955 ) over the relevant metallicity range of -1.5  @xmath8  [ fe / h ]  @xmath8  -2.2 .",
    "a near zero color difference of the blue fundamental edge of the strip for such clusters at the level of @xmath90.02 mag in b - v was later confirmed from more precise photoelectric data of horizontal branch stars , and better determinations of the e(b - v ) ( sandage 1969 ) .",
    "it was this conclusion that led to the near canonical assumption in the late 1980s that one should use a constant mean temperature of log t@xmath103.85 for the mid point of the strip in comparing the predictions from theoretical models of the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) with the observations ( s82a , s90b ) .",
    "however , this assumption of constant temperature for all metallicities led to the vigorous debate in the decades of 1985 and 1995 concerning the adequacy of the extant zahb models or , in fact , whether the period shifts claimed by the observers using data on amplitudes were real ( caputo 1988 ; lee 1990 ; lee , demarque , & zinn 1990 , hereafter ldz ; brocato , castellani , & ripepi 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless , _ continuous _ period shifts with metallicity , not just a _ dichotomy _ of mean period ratios , had been discovered by preston ( 1959 , his fig .",
    "4 ) for field rr lyraes with the non - zero slope of dlogp / d([fe / h ] ) @xmath9 -0.10 in the log p - metallicity relation . the continuum with this slope was later shown beyond doubt for the bright field rr lyraes from the larger sample of layden ( 1995 , his fig .",
    "1 ) .    other determinations of the slope at dlogp / d([fe / h ] ) = -0.12  @xmath7  0.02 for the period - metallicity correlation had also been derived from a variety of independent data for rrl in clusters ( sandage , katem , & sandage 1981 , hereafter sks ; s81b , table 7 , s82a , b ) .",
    "some of these determinations were from amplitude- metallicity correlations , some from rise - time - metallicity correlations , and some from period - temperature correlations within the strip as a function of metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , debate on the validity of period shifts determined using amplitudes remain . now",
    "the focus has shifted from questioning the validity of the zahb _ theoretical models _",
    ", to the role of evolution off the initial non - evolved sequence ( eg . ldz 1990 ; sandage 1990a ; brocato et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ; clement & sheldon 1999a , b ; cacciari , corwin , & carney 2004 ) .",
    "the evidence for a period - amplitude - metallicity relation at various temperatures remains as it was set out in 1981 ( s81a ) ; it has been rediscovered by carney , storm , & jones [ 1992 , their eq .",
    "( 16 ) ] , and by alcock et al .",
    "( 1998 ; alcock 2000 ) .",
    "it is useful to recall the strong debate in the 1990s concerning the observational data on period shifts .",
    "the extant zahb models did not predict such shifts when the predictions were made in a particular way , and the theoreticians , believing their models , questioned the interpretation of the observations on amplitudes and temperatures .",
    "the reasons were these .",
    "the early pioneering models of the luminosity level of the zahb level for different metallicitites had been made by sweigart and gross ( 1976 ) followed by sweigart , renzini , & tornambe ( 1987 , hereafter srt ) , bencivenni et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and dorman ( 1992 ) .",
    "a more complete list of references is in srt .",
    "modern updates of these pioneering papers are , among others , those of bono et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and catelan , pritzl & smith ( 2004 ) , each of which contain references to other recent models .    the period shifts with metallicity could be predicted from these models in the following way .",
    "the models give calculated tracks for the zahb in hr diagrams of log l , log t@xmath11 for different metallicities .",
    "they also give mass as a function of [ fe / h ] along the tracks . imposing a constant temperature line across the tracks , generally at log t@xmath11 = 3.85 , permitted log l and mass to be read along this fixed temperature line . a pulsation equation , p(l , m , t@xmath11,[fe / h ] ) that relates period , luminosity , and mass , is then used to predict how periods along the constant temperature line should vary with metallicity .",
    "these predictions gave a near zero slope ( s93b , fig .",
    "6b ) to a period - metallicity correlation rather than the value of dlogp / d([fe / h ] ) = -0.12 derived from the observations .",
    "the effect of the increased luminosity on the period as the metallicity is decreased was nearly cancelled by the corresponding increased mass along the zahb in these models , shown explicitly by simon and clement ( 1993 , the first and second unnumbered equations in their section 8) . and even if the effect of luminosity evolution from the zahb was included as in gratton , tornambe , & ortolani ( 1986 ) , and ldz ( 1990 , their table 2 ) , these models predicted a slope of the period - metallicity relation to be only dlogp / d([fe / h ] ) = -0.05 , but , again , _ when read at constant temperature_. this was less than half of what is observed .",
    "the solution of reconciling the model predictions with the observations , obvious now but not at the time , was to drop the condition of reading the models at constant temperature , but rather to let the temperature be cooler for more metal poor rrl at their higher luminosities .",
    "this solution had been proposed for rrc variables by simon and clement ( 1993 ) in their seminal paper on the discovery of methods to obtain luminosities , chemical abundances , masses , and temperature from various fourier components of the light curves for rrc variables .",
    "they stated , based on their theoretical expectations , that ``  it is not correct to formulate a period shift at constant temperature ( eg .",
    "sandage 1990b , apj 350 , 631 ) . ''",
    "the same solution of cooler temperature for the oosterhoff ii variables was proposed independently using the pulsation equation for rrab variables at the fundamental blue edge ( s93a , b ) .",
    "it was shown there that a variation of temperature at the bfe at the rate of dlogt@xmath11/d([fe / h ] ) = -0.012 would largely reconcile the prediction from the models and the observations of period - shifts , if a mild evolution is also introduced ( s93b , fig .",
    "6a compared to 6b ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to return to the problem , demonstrating more directly the need for a temperature variation with metallicity at the fundamental blue edge of the instability strip . in making the argument",
    "we reverse the dependent and independent variables in a pulsation equation by making t@xmath11 the independent variable to be determined by assuming the observed dependencies of log p , log l , and log mass on metallicity , all of which are better known now than in s93a .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 shows an updated period - metallicity correlation using the data in the catalog of 302 field rrl with measured metallicities by layden ( 1994 ) on the scale of zinn and west ( 1984 ) .",
    "there are nearly three times the number of field stars in the layden sample than in the catalog by blanco ( 1992 ) that was used in s93a .",
    "section 3 shows a similar period - metallicity distribution as in  2 for rrl in globular clusters from the updated catalog of cluster variables by clement ( 2001 ) that merges the data from the third catalog of sawyer hogg ( 1973 ) with new data complete to 2000 from the literature , adding about 30% to the data base used in s93a .",

    "( 1997a ) is given in  5 , and compared with that of dorman ( 1992 ) that was used in s93a .    in  6",
    "we combine the period - metallicity , m@xmath3-metallicity , and mass - metallicity relations from   2 - 5 with a pulsation equation to predict the temperature-([fe / h ] ) relation at the fbe .",
    "temperatures are transformed to ( b - v)@xmath2 colors in  7 using an adopted color - metallicity - temperature calibration .",
    "the predicted color - metallicity relation is compared in  8 with the observed ( b - v)@xmath2 colors for both field and cluster rrl .    in  9",
    "we turn the problem around by using the new correlations of period , temperature , and mass at the fbe to predict the rrl luminosity , again from the pulsation equation using a new temperature variation at the fbe that has been fitted empirically here to the observational data , rather than using the predicted variation in ",
    " 6 & 7 .",
    "section 10 contains a discussion of the observed difference in the zero - point of the log period-([fe / h ] ) envelope locus ( figs . 1 - 4 ) between field and cluster variables , and the presence or absence of the oosterhoff period gap in the cluster and the field star samples , respectively , in terms of a proposed different formation history of the samples .",
    "eight research points made in this paper are summarized in  11 .",
    "in the 1993 study ( s93a ) , i had used the correlation of mean period with metallicity for 110 field rr lyraes for which blanco ( 1992 ) had determined improved e(b - v ) reddenings .",
    "he also had homogenized the existing [ fe / h ] metallicity values based on butler s ( 1975 ) calibration of the preston @xmath0s metallicity parameter . the blanco - butler [ fe / h ] scale averages 0.28 dex more metal rich than the globular cluster scale of zinn and west ( 1984 ) .",
    "i had used the two different metallicity scales , one for the field variables and the other for the clusters , although i had transformed the blanco - butler scale to that of zinn and west .",
    "nevertheless , the field star log p-[fe / h ] diagrams were kept on the blanco - butler system , which , at times was inconvenient .",
    "this inconvenience is overcome here , and the sample of field stars has been increased by a factor of three by using the more recent data base of layden ( 1994 , 1995 ) which is on the zinn - west metallicity scale .",
    "layden measured metallicities for his complete sample of 302 rrab lyrae field variables whose galactic latitudes are more than @xmath12 , and whose apparent magnitudes are brighter than @xmath13 = 13.5 .",
    "layden s list is from the fourth edition of the general catalog of variable stars ( kholopov 1985 ) .",
    "the log p-[fe / h ] distribution for layden s field star sample is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a linear envelope line is drawn by eye as the locus of the shortest period variables at a given [ fe / h ] value .",

    "although the number of stars ( 302 ) in figs . 1 - 3 is sufficient to show the _ continuous _ variation of mean period with metallicity ( rather than a dichotomy into two period groups ) , nevertheless it is not yet sufficient to define the position of the short period envelope at the low metallicity end for [ fe / h ] @xmath20 -2 with precision . a larger sample of rr lyrae variables is needed and is available in globular clusters .",
    "the earlier sample from the third catalog of cluster variables by sawyer hogg ( 1973 ) was used in s93a for this purpose .",

    "3 fails to fit the data for the globular cluster variables .",
    "the cluster variables have longer periods at the envelope edge by @xmath0log p @xmath9 0.029 dex compared with equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the difference has a significance of about 4 sigma .",
    "there are several possibilities for explaining these two differences between field and cluster variables .",
    "point ( 1 ) .",
    "the very few variables in the cluster sample in fig . 4 between [ fe / h ] = -1.7 and -2.0 is due , as is well known , to the details of the morphology of cluster horizontal branches through the instability strip in this metallicity range .",
    "most clusters with intermediate metallicities with -1.3 @xmath8 [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -1.7 have horizontal branches well populated on both sides of the rr lyrae instability strip , whereas clusters with [ fe / h ] between -1.7 and -2.0 produce very few variables because the hb does not penetrate the instability strip .",
    "clearly , the absence of this oosterhoff period gap in the field variables shows that the morphology of the horizontal branch of the field rrl _ must _ differ fundamentally from that in globular clusters in this metallicity range .",
    "the reasons are not presently understood , but a hint may be the variation of the hb morphology with metallicity of the highly unusual globular clusters ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 ( rich 1997 et al . ;",
    "pritzl et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) where the hb penetrates the instability strip despite its high metal abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath9 -0.5 .",
    "this behavior is contrary to the horizontal branches of `` normal '' globular clusters such as 47 tuc , and the clump hbs of high metallicity galactic clusters .",
    "evidently , there is some parameter - variation ( such as the value of the core he abundance , the core mass , variations in deep mixing , etc . ) in these two highly abnormal globular clusters that causes the hb morphology to differ from that of most other of the clusters in the galaxy .",
    "point ( 2 ) .",
    "the observed period difference of 0.029 dex between cluster and field variables at the fbe can be accomplished in several ways from the pulsation eq .",
    "( 16 ) in  5 . among them is a luminosity difference of @xmath0log",
    "l = 0.027 at constant temperature and mass , or a temperature difference of @xmath0log t@xmath11 = 0.007 at constant l and mass , or a mass difference of @xmath0log mass = 0.034 at constant l and t@xmath11 , or combinations of each .",
    "it need only be recalled that gratton ( 1998 ) has already discussed the possibility that there may be `` a real difference between the luminosity of the horizontal branch for clusters and the field '' .",
    "point ( 3 ) .",
    "a third possibility is that the metallicity scale due to layden ( 1994 ) in figs . 1 - 3 for the field variables is not the same as the used by harris ( 1996 ) for the clusters .",
    "the difference seen between figs",
    ". 1 - 3 and fig .",
    "4 would disappear if the field points in figs.1 - 3 were moved downward by @xmath0[fe / h ] @xmath9 0.3 dex , or if the cluster data were made more metal poor by the same amount . but",
    "no systematic shifts by this amount are possible if the statements by both layden and by harris are correct that their scales are both tied to the scale of zinn and west ( 1984 ) .",
    "many calibrations , both observational and theoretical , of rr lyrae luminosities as functions of metallicity have been made since the linear calibration via the pulsation equation was made in s93a .",
    "all of the second and third generation theoretical models for the position of the _ zero - age _ horizontal branches show that the relation between m@xmath21 ( and hence closely m@xmath3 ) and [ fe / h ] must be non linear , i.e. the branch loci of the zahb tracks are more closely stacked in luminosity at the low metallicity end of the distribution than at the high metallicity end , for equal intervals of [ fe / h ] , even as the low metallicity zahbs are brighter than those of high metallicity .",

    "remarks that `` the reason for the discrepancy between the two studies is unclear at present .

    "the result is that the mean periods of the rrl are _ intermediate _ between the two oosterhoff groups in the galaxy ( catalan 2004 , table 1 ; siegel & majewski 2000 , their fig . 6 ) .",
    "the general morphology - metallicity progression for horizontal branches in the globular clusters in the galaxy is this .",
    "the hbs in the high metallicity clusters for [ fe / h ] @xmath54 do not penetrate the instability strip because they are redder than the strip color boundaries . hence",

    "a counter example in the opposite sense is ngc 7006 which has an abnormally red segment to its hb for its metallicity ( sandage & wildey 1967 ) , yet it contains many rrls . also in an opposite sense ( abnormally blue hb for its metallicity ) is m13 where the branch misses the instability strip altogether because of its excessive blueness , yet its metallicity is nearly identical with that of m3 which contains many variables ( cf .",
    "cho et al .",
    "2005 for a modern comparison of m3 and m13 ) .",
    "hence , the cluster morphology - metallicity relation that is responsible for the oosterhoff gap in the galaxy is not perfectly consistent .",
    "the most extreme examples of this second parameter effect are the metal rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9 -0.50 ) clusters ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 which have abnormally long periods for their amplitudes ( pritzl et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) , yet both have abnormally blue extended horizontal branches never before seen in other high metallicity clusters ( rich et al . 1997 ) . the globular cluster m2 is a less extreme example ( lee & carney 1999b ) with much longer periods for a given amplitude . also ,",
    "similar to m2 , the second- parameter custer ngc 5986 ( alves , bond , & onken 2001 ) has a period - amplitude diagram with abnormally long periods compared with even oosterhoff ii clusters , although the metal abundance is only -1.58 on the zinn & west system .",
    "its hb is abnormally blue , as in m13 ( van den bergh 1967 ) , for this metallicity .",
    "this is opposite the sense of the effect in ngc 7006 .",
    "although not yet conclusively proved , the reasons for such behavior is currently suspected to be different chemical composition effects that control the details of the hb morphology ( eg . variations in the helium core mass , differences in the mass loss from the agb to the hb , differences in the deep mixing etc . ) .",
    "if so , the difference between the field and the cluster rr lyraes ( figs",
    ". 1 and 4 ) would suggest that these field variables have had a different history in their chemical evolution than those in clusters .",
    "yes , but why ?",
    "suppose that the bulk of the field rrls have come from the disintegration of dwarf spheroidals that once were companions to the galaxy but have since been accreated and disrupted .",
    "this is almost certainly proved now by the discovery of the discrete rrl streams in the sloan survey for high latitude variables ( ivezic et al .",
    "2000 ; yanny et al .",
    "2000 ; newberg et al .",

    "these discrete streams , widely assumed to be debris from original dwarf spheroidal companions to the galaxy , now disrupted , are the generalization of the many high velocity moving groups discovered by eggen ( 1977 ) , the first of which was the grombridge 1830 group that contains rr lyrae itself ( eggen & sandage 1959 ) .",
    "the sloan survey , and other evidence before it ( eg .",
    "freeman 1987 ; majewski 1993 ; lynden - bell & lynden bell 1995 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) , showed that the eggen high velocity moving groups are real .",
    "the disruption of dwarf spheroidal galaxian companions is seen directly today in the sagittarius disintegrating dwarf ( ibata , gilmore , & irwin 1994 , 1995 ) as it is being torn apart by tidal interaction with the galaxy .",
    "it is known that the chemical evolution of the individual dwarf spheroidals differ , depending on their individaual luminosity , i.e. mass ( eg . aaronson 1986 ; skillman et al .",
    "1989 , caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ; mateo 1998 , his fig . 7 for a summary ) . hence , the hb morphology of the products of the disruption ( among which are the halo rrls ) , should also differ by second - parameter effects .",
    "in particular , as a group , they should differ from the `` normal '' hb morphology of galactic globular clusters where the chemical evolution has gone further toward `` completion '' because the much higher mass of the galaxy means stronger gravity and therefore the chemical products of agb nucleosynthesis can be retained , unlike the situation in the dwarf spheroidals where supernovae winds can cause mass loss from the parent dwarf .",
    "because of the variable ability of the parent galaxies to retain the products of the chemical build up , depending on the mass , the chemical evolution of the parent dwarf spheroidals has differed from that history for most of the globular clusters in the galaxy that have the normal oosterhoff gap .",
    "hence , the details of the oosterhoff effect can be expected to differ .",
    "if so , one can no longer support the canonical idea that the field rr lyraes have come from the general galactic globular cluster population , but rather from the previous dwarf spheroidal companions with varying hb morphologies .",
    "the hypothesis to be tested is this .",
    "the majority of the globular clusters in the inner galactic halo have a common origin that coincided with the origin of the bulk of the galaxy itself ( van den bergh & mackey 2004 ) .",
    "the evidence supports the idea that this process is a more or less coherent collapse , albeit with noise , similar to that of eggen et al .",
    "( 1962 , els ; sandage 1990c ) for the lower halo , the bulge , and thin , and thick disks . on the other hand ,",
    "as argued above , many of the halo field variables have come from the `` outside '' in a type of searle - zinn ( 1978 ) bottom - up hierarchical fragmentary build up in some form of the cold dark matter scenario for origins .",
    "however , the most telling argument against the bottom - up build up from fragments of the _ bulk _ of the galaxy , and other similar high mass galaxies , is the recent discovery of normal e galaxies at the very large redshifts of z @xmath8 2 ( mccarthy 2004 ) which would not exist in the hierarchical build - up from small fragments .",
    "rather , there existence is the natural consequence of an els - type collapse on time scale short relative to the hubble time .",
    "said differently , normal e galaxies undergoing passive evolution , but otherwise fully formed , can not be created by slow hierarchical build up on the cold dark matter scenario , but must be formed very early , very rapidly , all components of a protogalxy having a negative total energy .",
    "this is direct els .",
    "a test of the different - origins hypothesis for the field and the cluster variables in the galaxy is to map the morphology- metallicity relation of the hb of the dwarf spheroidals and to match the differences in the period - metallicity envelope , for example , with such second parameter indicators as the period- amplitude relation , the period - rise tine correlation , and the period - color relations with the oosterhoff period shifts as functions of morphology and metallicity .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of this paper but is in progress .",
    "there are eight principle research points in this paper .",
    "the best fitting envelope of the period - metallicity correlation ( fig .",
    "1 ) at the shortest periods for the field rr lyraes in the layden ( 1994 ) sample is non - linear . a parabolic relation [ eq . ( 5 ) ] more adequately fits the data at low metallicity than the linear envelope adopted earlier ( s93a ) .",
    "the shape of the envelope in item 1 is also a good fit to the period - metallicity relation for rrl in globular clusters ( fig .",
    "4 ) , except that it is displaced in zero point toward longer periods by @xmath0log p = 0.029 @xmath7 0.007 .",
    "this is another piece of evidence , joining several already in the literature , that the field and cluster variables may have different origins ( points 7 and 8 below ) .",
    "the equations for various period - metallicity envelopes in items 1 and 2 are inserted into the pulsation equation , together with a series of new calibrations of the absolute magnitude of rr lyrae variables , and with an updated calibration of rr lyrae mass with metallicity , to predict a family of temperature variations at the fundamental blue edge as function of metallicity .",
    "all combinations of the input assumptions show that t@xmath11 at the fbe varies with metallicity , changing by @xmath0log t@xmath11 = 0.04 over the range of ( [ fe / h ] ) between 0 and -2.5 .",
    "it first becomes hotter as [ fe / h ] changes from 0 to -1.5 , and then cooler for as the metallicity decreases further ( figs .",
    "5 & 6 ) .",
    "the predicted fbe temperatures are transformed into b - v color ( figs . 7 & 8) by the adopted temperature - color relation of eq .",
    "the color variation is predicted to be at the level of 0.03 mag in ( b - v ) for [ fe / h ] between -1.0 and -2.5 for any given choice of the absolute magnitude calibration and of the variation of the period - metallicity locus at the fbe .",
    "comparison of this predicted color variation for both field and cluster variables ( figs . 9 & 10 ) shows general agreement in the shape of the variation and in the color zero point .",
    "the agreement of this theoretical color zero point with the observations is remarkable because the calculations are made adopting the zero points in the pulsation equation [ eq . ( 16 ) ] , the mass equation ( 15 ) , the color - temperature transformation eq .",
    "( 18 ) , and the luminosity calibration equations , each of which have a range of uncertainty .    \\6 .",
    "an iteration of the predicted envelope locus for the color - metallicity correlations of figs .",
    "9 and 10 to better fit the color-[fe / h ] data for metallicities smaller than -2.0 gives the semi - empirical locus of eq .",
    "( 20 ) , shown in fig . 11 .",
    "this envelope , now made to better fit the observations , is used to make the calculation via the pulsation backward to obtain an improved absolute magnitude calibration of eq .",
    "( 23 ) which refers to the age zero hb .",
    "this equation is then re - zero pointed to refer to the average evolved hb by adopting the clementini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) lmc observation that @xmath55 = 19.064 at [ fe / h ] = -1.5 for the lmc rrls and using the modulus of the lmc as ( m - m)@xmath2 = 18.54 ( tammann et al . 2003 ) which does not use the lmc classical cepheids .",
    "this gives a new calibration of the average m@xmath3 of the evolved hb of galactic globular clusters [ ( eq . ( 24 ) ] .",
    "\\7 . returning to the observed offset of the period- metallicity envelopes for the period distributions of the field variables relative to those in clusters ( figs . 1 & 4 ) , and the presence or absence of the oosterhoff gap in the clusters and in the field ,",
    "we conclude that the origins of the two groups may be different .",
    "the presence in one and absence in the other of the oosterhoff gap proves that the variation of the morphology of the hb with [ fe / h ] differs between the two groups .",
    "this is another manifestation of the second parameter effect seen in only a handful of the galactic globular clusters such as m13 , ngc 7006 , m2 , ngc 5986 and the extreme cases of ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 .",
    "we agree with the growing consensus that the origin of at least a subset of the halo variables is the disruption by tidal friction of structures related to the dwarf spheroidals , where it is known that they have varying degrees of chemical evolution- completion depending on their mass ( luminosity ) .",
    "it is also known that the oosterhoff gap characteristics varies among them .",
    "this variation is suggested to manifest itself in the difference in the morphology of the hb between the galaxy and the dwarf spheroidals , similar to the differences seen between the bulk of the galactic globular clusters and the second parameter clusters such as ngc 6838 , ngc 6441 , ngc 7006 , m2 , and ngc 5986 .",
    "a test of the hypothesis is to study the systematics of the morphology of the dwarf spheroidal hbs and its variation with metallicity . the hb morphology for them",
    "is expected to be systematically different from that in the galaxy , and that difference is postulated to be a function of the mean metallicity .",
    "such a study of comparative hb morphology between the normal and the second parameter globular clusters in the galaxy and the local dwarf spheroidal companions is beyond the scope of this paper , but has been started .",
    "acknowledgements : an early paper ( unpublished ) , refereed by geselle clementini , has been rewritten here with a different goal and emphasis .",

    "other comments on the original paper by fillipina caputo were equally important in reconstituting it here , as were comments by carla cacciari and flavio fusi pecci .",

    "<S> the purpose of the paper is to predict the temperature at the fundamental blue edge ( fbe ) of the instability strip for rr lyrae ( rrl ) variables from the pulsation equation that relates temperature to period , luminosity , and mass . </S>",
    "<S> modern data for the correlations between period , luminosity , and metallicity at the fbe for field and cluster rrl are used for the temperature calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted temperatures are changed to b - v colors using an adopted color transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted temperatures at the fbe become hotter as [ fe / h ] changes from 0 to -1.5 , and thereafter cooler as the metallicity decreases to -2.5 and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature range over this interval of metallicity is @xmath0log @xmath1 = 0.04 , or 640 k at 6900k . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted color variation is at the level of 0.03 mag in b - v . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions are compared with the observed rrl colors at the fbe for both the field and cluster variables , showing general agreement at the level of 0.02 mag in ( b - v)@xmath2 , which , however , is the uncertainty of the reddening corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> the focus of the problem is then reversed by fitting a better envelope to the observed fbe relation between color and metallicity for metallicities smaller than -1.8 which , when inserted in the pulsation equation , gives a non - linear calibration of the absolute magnitude of the average evolved level of the hb of m@xmath3 = 1.109 + 0.600 ( [ fe / h ] ) + 0.140 ( [ fe / h])@xmath4 , where the zero point has been set by the observed rr lyrae stars in the lmc at @xmath5v@xmath6 = 19.064 for [ fe / h ] = -1.5 , and using an adopted lmc modulus of ( m - m)@xmath2 = 18.54 .    </S>",
    "<S> the position of the envelope locus at the shortest periods for the observed period - metallicity correlation differs between the field and cluster variables by @xmath0log p = 0.029 @xmath7 0.007 , the field variables having the shorter periods at the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the field and cluster variables also differ in the near absence of cluster rr lyraes in the -1.7 @xmath8 [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -2.0 metallicity interval , whereas the field variables show no such gap . </S>",
    "<S> we aver that these differences require different origins for the field and the cluster variables .    </S>",
    "<S> a test is proposed by comparing the morphology of the horizontal branches in the local dwarf spheroidals with that in the galactic globular clusters in the inner halo and by relating the differences with the relevant second parameter indicators . </S>"
