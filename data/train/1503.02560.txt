    "the identification of habitable regions around main - sequence stars constitutes a vital topic of contemporaneous astrobiological research .",
    "however , previous efforts concern mostly late - type stars at the lower end of the effective temperature scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though notable exceptions include the work on f - type stars by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied uv radiation environments for various main - sequence stars for different types of planetary atmospheres with different concentrations of n@xmath0 and co@xmath0 , including genuine efforts to resemble the archean earth .",
    "he concluded that life may be able to survive in the vicinity of most main - sequence stars of spectral type f , g and k. moreover , @xcite introduced the concept of a uv habitable zone ( uv - hz ) for main - sequence stars , including applications to exosolar systems known at the time of study .",
    "a more recent contribution has been made by @xcite , henceforth called paper  i. they focused on f - type stars of masses between 1.2 and 1.5  @xmath1 , and considered numerous important aspects , including ( 1 ) the role of stellar main - sequence evolution , ( 2 ) the location of planets within or relative to the circumstellar habitable zones , and ( 3 ) the general influence of planetary atmospheric attenuation , which was described through parameterized attenuation functions .",
    "it was found that the damage inflicted on dna for planets at earth - equivalent ( i.e. , homeothermic ) positions is between a factor of 2.5 and 7.1 higher than for solar - like stars , and the amount of damage critically depends on the planetary position . additionally , there are intricate astrobiological relations for the time - dependency of damage during stellar evolutionary patterns .",
    "if atmospheric attenuation is considered , lesser amounts of damage are obtained in response to the model - dependent attenuation parameters .",
    "previous work by , e.g. , @xcite suggests that uv radiation has a momentous potential of inducing significant damage on ( or loss of ) hydrocarbon - based life forms , the fundamental question , i.e. ,  is uv a friend or a foe ? \" , however , still remains unanswered .",
    "favorable assessments about the role of uv , also encompassing the origin of life , stem from numerous studies , as , e.g. , the work by @xcite .",
    "this study indicates that uv light may have played a key role in the accumulation of the first polynucleotides through their abiogenic selection as the most uv - resistant biopolymers , a crucial step for the origin of self - replicating rna - type molecules showing sufficient complexity for undergoing darwinian evolution .",
    "setting those fundamental topics aside , noting that they are outside the main scope of our study , we tend to our main theme , which is the assessment of the uv environments of f - type stars . objects of interest in such environments include potentially habitable objects such as earth - type planets located in the stellar climatological habitable zone / h@xmath0o / n@xmath0 atmosphere and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the object s surface ; see sect .  2.1 for details , including updates by @xcite .",
    "] ( cli - hz ) .",
    "other possibilities for the facilitation of habitability include objects associated with jupiter - type planets , located in the cli - hz , such exosolar trojan planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or massive exomoons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "systems with giant planets located inside or crossing into the cli - hz during their orbital motion are typically unable of hosting habitable planets ; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for results from orbital stability simulations .    hence , the focus of the present work is on the study of potential exomoons in the environments of f - type stars possessing observed jupiter - type planets .",
    "the systems selected for our study include hd  8673 , hd  169830 , hd  33564 , @xmath2  and , hd  86264 , hd  25171 , 30  ari , and hd  153950 ( see fig .  1 and table  1 ) based on data sets not considering additions due to the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "figure 1 conveys the stellar positions in the hr diagram , indicating that three stars , i.e. , hd  33564 , hd  25171 , and 30  ari  b , are in essence zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) stars , whereas the other five stars have started to evolve away from the main - sequence .",
    "note that the _ kepler _ mission has revealed many new systems of f - stars hosting jupiter - type planets , constituting relevant targets of future research .    exomoons , albeit the lack of heretofore detections have been the topic of numerous previous studies ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review on the formation , prospects of habitability and detection methodologies for exomoons .",
    "thus , the continued investigation of exomoons is timely .",
    "the topic of this work is a balanced consideration of the cli - hz and uv - hz for possible exomoons in f - star systems , with consideration of hill stability . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no such paper has previously been published along those lines .",
    "it is structured as follows : in sect .  2",
    ", we describe the theoretical approach , including the key equations and concepts . in sect .  3 ,",
    "we introduce our target star  planet systems . in sect .  4 , we address various studies of exomoons , including the calculation of the hill s spheres for the exoplanets . in sect .  5 , we present the results of our study .",
    "our summary and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "a crucial aspect in the study of circumstellar habitability is the introduction of the cli - hz , a concept , previously considered by @xcite and others . even though the centerpiece of our study is quantifying impact of uv ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , the cli - hz is important for two reasons .",
    "first , it conveys reference distances of habitability , which can be compared to the orbits of the jupiter - type planets .",
    "those limits are also relevant to possible exomoons , which are expected to be in close proximity to their host planets .",
    "second , the inner and outer limits of the cli - hz can also be used as markers for the assessment of uv habitability , particularly the quantity @xmath3 ( see sect . 5.1 ) , thus allowing to interpret our results .",
    "previously , @xcite utilized 1-d climate models , which were state - of - the - art at the time , to estimate the position and width of the cli - hz for a range of main - sequence stars , include the sun .",
    "the basic premise was the assumption of an earth - like planet with a co@xmath0/h@xmath0o / n@xmath0 atmosphere and , furthermore , that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the object s surface .",
    "this work was significantly updated through subsequent studies , including the work by @xcite .",
    "for example , it considers the recent venus / early mars ( rvem ) limits of the cli - hz , previously considered by @xcite .",
    "other important limits for the cli - hzs are based on the runaway greenhouse effect ( inner limit ) and maximum greenhouse effect ( outer limit ) ; in the following , these limits are used to signify the general habitable zone ( ghz ) ; see fig .",
    "as described by , e.g. , @xcite , at the inner limit , the greenhouse phenomenon is enhanced by water vapor , thus promoting surface warming , which increases the atmospheric water vapor content , thus further raising the surface temperature . at sufficient stellar flux",
    ", this will trigger the rapid evaporation of all surface water .",
    "thus , all water will be lost from the surface , and the water will also be lost from the upper atmosphere by photodissociation and subsequent water escape to space . concerning the outer limit , it is assumed that a cloud - free co@xmath0 atmosphere shall still be able to provide a surface temperature of 273  k. the most extreme outer limit is that for the extended habitable zone ( ehz ) , which in the solar system extends up to 2.40  au @xcite .    for solar - like stars , and assuming an earth - mass object , @xcite identified those limits as approximately 0.95 and 1.68 au , respectively .",
    "in contrast , @xcite identified these values as 0.84 and 1.67  au , respectively . another important limit on habitability is given by the moist greenhouse limit , which for solar - like stars has been updated to 0.99  au . in the previous work by @xcite another limit was identified given by the first co@xmath0 condensation obtained by the onset of formation of co@xmath0 clouds at a temperature of 273  k , which was however not revisited by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the present work , the moist greenhouse limit and the limit due to the first co@xmath0 condensation are used to define the conservative habitable zone ( chz ) , as motivated by a large array of previous studies .",
    "the extents of the chz , ghz and ehz for the target stars ( see table  1 ) are given in table  2 .",
    "the results are in agreement with previous studies , which showed that the more luminous the star , the larger the extent of the cli - hzs .",
    "even though the cli - hzs of f - type stars are considerably wider than those of solar - like stars , stars with masses larger than 1.2  @xmath1 possess continuously habitable zones for less than the current age of earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". nevertheless , this window of time may still be sufficient for the build - up of extraterrestrial biospheres .",
    "furthermore , a higher stellar luminosity also means that the inner limits of the respective hz is placed further outward .",
    "a more thorough assessment of both the widths and the limits of the various types of hzs requires the consideration of both the luminosities and the effective temperatures of the target stars , which is done as part of our approach .",
    "for example , it is found that cli - hz of the largest width is obtained for hd  86264 , where the ehz extends from 1.60 to 5.06  au .",
    "somewhat smaller extents for the cli - hz are found for hd  8673 and @xmath2  and  a ; here the outer limits of the ehzs are given as 4.37 and 4.39  au , respectively .",
    "relatively small extents for the cli - hz are found for hd  33564 and 30  ari  b. here the inner limits are at about 0.95  au , whereas the outer limits extent to nearly 3.0  au .",
    "these stars are late - type f - stars with luminosities of 1.66 and 1.64 @xmath4 , respectively ( see table  1 ) . figure  3 conveys the various domains of the cli - hzs together with the exoplanetary distances from their host stars , also taking into account the eccentricities of the stellar orbits .",
    "detailed observational results about the various target stars are the focus of sect .  3 .",
    "following paper  i , we consider the dna action spectrum as a proxy to simulate the impact of uv radiation regarding hydrocarbon - based biostructure .",
    "generally , an action spectrum is the rate of physiological activity plotted against wavelength or frequency of light .",
    "biological effectiveness spectra can be derived from spectral data by multiplication with an action spectrum @xmath5 of a relevant photobiological reaction with the action spectrum typically given in relative units normalized to unity for , e.g. , @xmath6  nm . the biological effectiveness for a distinct range of the electromagnetic spectrum such as uv radiation is determined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the stellar irradiance ( ergs  @xmath9  s@xmath10  nm@xmath10 ) , @xmath11 the wavelength ( nm ) , and @xmath12 the planetary atmospheric attenuation function ; see @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the limits of integration which in our computations are set as 200 nm and 400 nm , respectively .",
    "although a significant amount of stellar radiation exists beyond 400 nm , this portion of the spectrum is disregarded in the following owing to the minuscule values for the action spectrum @xmath5 in this regime .",
    "atmospheric attenuation , also referred to as extinction , results in a loss of intensity of the incident stellar radiation . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath15 = 1 indicates no loss and @xmath15 = 0 indicates a complete loss ( see sect .",
    "2.3 ) .    for the computation of the stellar irradiance for targets in circumstellar environments , typically positioned in the cli - hz ( see table  2 )",
    ", the domain of interest in the present study , a further equation is needed , which is @xmath16 here @xmath17 denotes the stellar radiative flux per unit surface , @xmath18 is the stellar radius and @xmath19 is the distance between the target and the star .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 2 ) describes the geometrical dilution of the stellar radiation field .",
    "based on previous work , the uv region of the electromagnetic spectrum has been divided into three bands termed uv - a , uv - b , and uv - c .",
    "the subdivisions are somewhat arbitrary and differ slightly depending on the discipline involved . in paper",
    "i , we used uv - a , 400 - 320 nm ; uv - b , 320 - 290 nm ; and uv - c , 290 - 200 nm . due to the shape of the action spectrum , it was found that in the environments of f - type stars , most of the damage occurs with respect to uv - c .",
    "if the incident stellar radiation is largely blocked in the short wavelength regime of the dna action spectrum , due to atmospheric attenuation ( see below ) , the majority of damage may occur regarding uv - b .",
    "detailed information for sets of f - type stars , also considering effects of stellar evolution , has been described in detail in paper  i.    through using an earlier version for the dna action spectrum previous results were given by @xcite .",
    "action spectra for dna , also to be viewed as weighting functions , have previously been utilized to quantify damage due to uv radiation @xcite .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the dna action spectrum increases by almost four orders of magnitude between 400 and 300  nm ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the wavelength dependence of the absorption and ionization potential of uv radiation in this particular regime .",
    "a further significant increase in the dna action spectrum occurs between 300 and 200  nm .",
    "regarding earth , it is found that the terrestrial earth s ozone layer is able to filter out this type of lethal radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the terrestrial ozone layer itself has been an important feature for allowing its oxygen level to rise , and thus paving the way for the development of more sophisticated life forms .",
    "the treatment of the stellar irradiance follows closely the concept of paper  i. the accurate account of stellar radiation is employed , including the adequate spectral energy distribution , by utilizing photospheric models computed by the phoenix code following ; see @xcite and subsequent work .",
    "the adopted range of models for the f - type stars are in response to effective temperatures of 6440  k for spectral type f5 , 6200  k for f8 , and 6050  k for g0 @xmath20 f10 .",
    "contrary to paper  i , early - type f stars are not part of the sample , and their spectral information is thus not needed . for stars intermediate to that grid",
    ", spectral information is interpolated in accord to the stellar effective temperatures .",
    "the phoenix code solves the equation of state , including a very large number of atoms , ions , and molecules . with respect to radiation , the one - dimensional spherically symmetrical radiative transfer equation for expanding atmospheres",
    "is solved , including a treatment of special relativity .",
    "opacities are sampled dynamically over about 80 million lines from atomic transitions and billions of molecular lines , in addition to background ( i.e. , continuous ) opacities , to provide an emerging spectral flux as reliable and realistic as possible ; see paper  i for further details and references .    figure  5 depicts the dna response to stellar photospheric radiation in the uv range for selected stellar types between f5 and g2 .",
    "the irradiance has been based on phoenix models using smoothing based on a bandbass of 1  nm .",
    "next , the dna action spectrum has been multiplied with the smoothed irradiance data for the range between 200 and 400  nm to attain the data for the figure .",
    "a relevant ingredient to our study is the consideration of atmospheric attenuation @xmath12 , which typically results in a notable reduction of the incident stellar radiation .",
    "appropriate values for @xmath12 can be obtained through the analysis of theoretical exoatmospheric models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent work ) or the usage of model - dependent historic earth data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the scope of the present work that is focused on the impact of photospheric radiation from different f - type stars , we consider @xmath12 as described by a parameterized attenuation function att defined equal to 0 and",

    "paper  i for examples of @xmath26 .    for example",
    ", @xcite provided information about the ultraviolet irradiance reaching the surface of archean earth for various assumptions about earth s atmospheric composition ; the latter allow us to constrain the wavelength - dependent attenuation coefficients .",
    "this particular case is akin to the choice of @xmath27 .",
    "detailed results for planetary atmospheres for the build - up and destruction of ozone have been given by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the concept of uv habitable zones , as considered in our study , closely follows the previous work by @xcite .",
    "it again follows the key idea that , on the one hand , uv radiation may have provided an important energy source for early earth for the synthesis of many biochemical compounds and thus fostering various biogenesis processes , but , on the other hand , excessive amounts of uv are destructive ( see sect .  1 ) .",
    "another consideration includes the  principle of mediocrity \" ( pom ) , which suggests that the biological system of earth is about average , and that the development of life and intelligence outside of earth is governed by the same laws and concepts as previously on earth if proper conditions are met ; see @xcite for additional comments and references . as an example of exobiology , @xcite employed the pom to estimate the maximum number of habitable planets at the time of earth s origin in the framework of geobiology .",
    "akin to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xcite introduced a measure for the dna damage due to uv photons radiated by a star of age @xmath28 that reaches the top of a planetary or exomoon atmosphere at a distance @xmath19 ( in au ) .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath5 denotes the dna action spectrum ( see eq .  1 ) , @xmath30 the stellar uv flux at 1  au , @xmath31 the planck constant , and @xmath32 is the speed of light .",
    "here we use @xmath33  nm and @xmath34  nm , although the choice of 315  nm for @xmath14 , as done by @xcite , is acceptable owing to the minuscule values for @xmath5 in the uv - a regime . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the phoenix models are adopted , which are interpolated based on the stellar effective temperature , as needed .",
    "the domains of the stellar uv - hzs are defined based on the pom according to @xmath35 with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspond to the outer and the inner limit of a uv - hz , respectively . ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath39 is determined based on eq .",
    "4 , using the flux received by the archean earth ( arce ) , i.e. , about @xmath403.8  gyr ago , which is assumed equal to 75% of the present sun s radiation on top of earth s atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the limits of the uv - hzs can be calculated based on eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) through solving for @xmath19 .",
    "the uv - hzs for our target stars are depicted in fig .  7 ;",
    "they are also compared to the cli - hzs .",
    "it is found that the uv - hzs are always larger than the ghz , but are notably smaller than the respective ehz , in consideration of that they do not extend as far outward ; see table  2 and 3 for additional information .",
    "note that both findings also apply to the sun , where the uv - hz extends from 0.71 to 1.90  au @xcite , whereas the ehz , as defined in the present study , extends up to 2.40  au @xcite .",

    "examples include the work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they consider a large variety of aspects including orbital stability considerations , formation of exomoons around super - jovian planets , magnetic shielding of exomoons beyond the circumplanetary habitable edge , deciphering spectral fingerprints ( which could potentially lead to the detection of life ) , and the lower mass limit of exomoons required for retaining a substantial and long - lived atmosphere",
    ".    strictly speaking , exomoons could also be akin to terrestrial or super - earth planets in size and mass if orbiting a jupiter - type planet . in this case , the existence and retention of the moon s armosphere is expected to be virtually guaranteed ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent observational study .",
    "atmospheres of large exomoons might also enjoy the benefit of magnetic protection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and subsequent work ) , which will be able to counteract the impact of energetic stellar radiation , especially for young stars ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "detailed studies about atmospheric losses due to energetic stellar radiation have previously been given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "additional studies about exomoons have been devoted to search methodologies as discussed by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite , including subequent studies by the same group of authors , focused on the detectability of potentially habitable exomoons , i.e. , exomoons located in the stellar cli - hzs .",
    "emphasis has been placed on results from the _ kepler _ space mission through the virtue of photodynamics and sophisticated data analysis techniques .",
    "@xcite suggested to identify exomoons through observations of radio emissions ; this type of research is guided by the physical structure of the jupiter  io system .",
    "a crucial aspect for the existence of exomoons concerns the necessity of orbital stability . because of three - body interaction ,",
    "moons will be lost from their host planet if the distance between the planet and moon is too large .",
    "this underlying orbital stability limit can not be calculated in a straightforward manner , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein , although provisional insight can be obtained if assumed that the moon s orbit must remain within the hill sphere ( or hill radius ) given as @xmath60 see @xcite and references therein . here",

    "moreover , we also list @xmath70 to indicate the relative importance of the hill radius for each system . in this regard",
    ", we found that the relative extent of the hill radius is most pronounced for 30  ari  bb , closely followed by @xmath2  and  ad , and least pronounced for hd  8673b .",
    "however , though widely used , the hill radius is a far - from - perfect measure for assessing or predicting the orbital stability of possible exomoons in those systems as typically only a moderate fraction of @xmath71 is available .",
    "limitations and modifications of the concept of hill radius , also referred to as hill stability , have been explored by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "as part of our study , we explore the impact of the uv levels that possible exomoons of the eight systems would experience by computing @xmath3 for the cli - hzs and for the various exoplanetary orbits .",
    "@xmath3 describes the ratio of uv infliction on dna for a particular set of conditions to the case without any atmospheric interference for an object at 1 au from the sun .",
    "hence , @xmath72 implies that the set of conditions creates a similar level of uv - based damage as it would be found immediately above the earth s atmosphere .",
    "here we simulate the case of no atmosphere as well as four cases of different atmospheric attenuations for each planetary system .",
    "the results of the case without atmospheric attenuation , i.e. , att@xmath73 , are given in fig .",
    "the ranges of @xmath3 corresponding to the cli - hzs and to the orbits of possible exomoons ( represented by their hosts , the jupiter - type planets ) are shown by different colors .",
    "as expected , the uv levels in the cli - hzs of the f - type stars are generally more severe than for the solar environment , except for regions beyond the outer limits of the ghzs . in the most severe case , found at the inner limit of the ehz for hd  8673",
    ", @xmath3 is 5.2 . for this star ,",
    "@xmath3 at the outer limits of the ghz and ehz are 1.1 and 0.53 , respectively . at the inner limit of the ehz of hd  153950 , which has the lowest @xmath74 of our target stars ,",
    "@xmath3 is given as 3.2 .",
    "for hd  153950 , @xmath3 at the outer limits of the chz , ghz , and ehz are identified as 1.0 , 0.63 and 0.32 , respectively .",
    "the distances between the host stars and the various limits of cli - hzs are strongly correlated with the stellar luminosities rather than the stellar effective temperatures .",
    "however , @xmath3 at the limits of the cli - hzs is mostly correlated with the star s effective temperature .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath3 at the inner limit of the ehz for a relatively hot star is higher than that for a relatively cool star .",
    "moreover , the differences between @xmath3 at the various outer and inner limits of a cli - hz are correlated with the stellar effective temperatures as well , whereas the widths of cli - hzs mostly depend on the stellar luminosities .",
    "thus , @xmath3 shows a steep rate of change with location within the cli - hz for a hot , but less luminous star .",
    "in the case of hd  33564 , the ehz extends from 0.95 to 2.99  au ( see table  2 ) , and the values for the @xmath3 at the limits are given as 4.7 and 0.47 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , hd  86264 , which is cooler but more luminous than hd  33564 , has a wider ehz extending from 1.60 to 5.06  au ; thus , the change in @xmath3 with distance in the cli - hz is more gradual . for hd  86264 , @xmath3 at the inner and outer limit of the ehz",
    "is identified as 4.5 and 0.45 , respectively . however",
    ", a wider cli - hz does not necessarily imply that there is a wider area of a relatively mild uv environment .",
    "for example , the ehz of hd  8673 extends from 1.39 to 4.37  au , but the region in the ehz with @xmath75 only extends from 3.17 to 4.37  au .",
    "hd  15395 has a narrower ehz , extending from 1.10 to 3.48  au , but has a slightly wider region within the ehz with @xmath75 ; this latter region extends from 1.96 to 3.48  au .",
    "also note that for any star considered in our study , the @xmath3 values obtained at the outer limits of the ehzs are fairly similar .",
    "the uv environments along the orbits of possible exomoons , hosted by exoplanets of very high eccentricities , i.e. , hd  8673b and hd  86264b ( see table  4 ) , are most severe , as expected .",
    "hypothetical exomoons of hd  8673b and hd  86264b would experience @xmath3 values as high as 14.3 and 15.7 , respectively , at the periapsis ; however , these values would decreases to 0.37 and 0.49 , respectively , at the exoplanets apoapsis positions .",
    "fortunately , following kepler s second law , excursions of these exoplanets , and by implication , any possible exomoon , close to the host stars would be only of relatively short durations considering the relatively high orbital speeds at those positions .",
    "in contrast , hd  25171b s orbit has a relatively low eccentricity , entailing that any possible exomoon would face an environment even milder than that of today s earth .",
    "furthermore , any possible exomoon would be subjected to small fluctuations regarding possible dna damage along its orbit , ranging from @xmath76 to 0.52 .",
    "the uv environments for hd  196830c and @xmath2  and  ad are relatively moderate as well .",
    "the values of @xmath3 at the periapsis and apoapsis of hd  196830c are identified as 2.1 and 0.52 , whereas for @xmath2  and  ad , they are given as 2.8 and 0.82 , respectively .",
    "we also studied the impact of atmospheric attenuation regarding uv habitability of possible exomoons .",
    "it is found that @xmath3 is greatly reduced for the four cases of atmospheric attenuation taken into account , with the combinations of attenuation parameters given as ( i )  @xmath77 , ( ii )  @xmath78 , ( iii )  @xmath79 , and ( iv )  @xmath80 ( see also paper  i ) .",
    "case ( iv ) attenuates uv radiation most effectively . case ( ii ) is the least effective of the four cases . in case ( iv ) , @xmath3 in the cli - hzs is almost at the same level for all systems taken into account . note that case ( i ) approximately corresponds to the atmospheric setting of the archean earth that has been realized about @xmath403.8  gyr ago .    regarding hd  8673 ,",
    "@xmath3 is given as 0.17 and 0.018 at the inner and outer limits of the ehz , respectively .",
    "similarly , the values for the @xmath3 at the inner and outer limits of the ehz of hd  153950 are given as 0.13 and 0.013 , respectively . even case ( ii )",
    "shows a drastic reduction in @xmath3 compared to the case without atmospheric attenuation . in this case",
    ", @xmath3 is given as 1.5 and 0.15 at the inner and outer limits of the ehz of hd  8673 , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 is found as 1.0 and 0.10 at the inner and outer limit of the ehz of hd  153950 , respectively .",
    "the effect of atmospheric attenuation is highly significant in extreme situations for possible exomoons , as , e.g. , at the periapsis position of hd  86264b .",
    "@xmath3 in that case is reduced to ( i )  4.5 , ( ii )  4.9 , ( iii )  1.6 , and ( iv )  0.6 . on the other hand , @xmath3 at the apoapsis position of hd  86264b",
    "is given as ( i )  0.14 , ( ii )  0.15 , ( iii )  0.049 , and ( iv )  0.019 .",
    "concerning possible exomoons of hd  25171b , atmospheric attenuation as assumed results in even gentler uv environments . at the periapsis and apoapsis positions of hd  257171b , @xmath3 is given as ( i )  0.15 and 0.10 , ( ii )  0.16 and 0.12 , ( iii )  0.052 and 0.038 , and ( iv )  0.020 and 0.015 , respectively .",
    "again , the case ( i ) is aligned to the atmospheric attenuation of the archean earth .",
    "the aim of this study is to provide a tentative exploration of the astrobiological significance of selected f - type stars based on their uv environments , which host jupiter - type planets within or close to their cli - hzs ; it is assumed that these planets may also be hosts to exomoons . in this context",
    ", we pursue a balanced consideration of the cli - hz and uv - hz for those systems , with the orbital stability of the possible exomoons described by the hill stability criterion as well as by the work of @xcite .",
    "the planets have different orbital properties , noting that their semi - major axes range from 0.995 to 3.02  au , and the eccentricities range from 0.08 ( almost circular ) to 0.72 ( highly elliptical ) .",
    "furthermore , the host stars have notably different masses and ages .",
    "the youngest star is 30  ari  b , an early main - sequence star , with an age of @xmath81  gyr @xcite .",
    "the most advanced stars are hd  25171 and hd  153950 with ages of @xmath82",
    "gyr @xcite and @xmath83  gyr @xcite .",
    "although exomoons have not yet been detected for systems , the possible existence of moons stems from inspecting the solar system , noting that jupiter and saturn possess two to five planet - like moons combined , with the exact number dependent on the adopted standard .",
    "generally , even if exomoons turn out to be absent in our systems of study , our approach will offer a template for tentatively assessing habitability in other systems with exomoons , if identified .",
    "we recognize that the discovery of exomoons in f - star systems is particularly challenging ; in fact , from the current point - of - view it is beyond existing technology .",
    "generally , observational constraints on the atmospheres of exoplanets might be accessible through stellar transits @xcite . in case of exomoons ,",
    "a hypothetical opportunity might exist through exomoon transits around luminous , directly imaged giant planets @xcite . on the other hand , exomoon detections around f - type stars",
    "will be particularly challenging ( and reserved to future endeavors ) because of the tiny moon - to - star radius ratio @xcite .",
    "thus , the value of our study should be considered in a more general context , as it constitutes a particular theoretical example of ( potential ) habitability of exomoons , which we intend to augment to other cases , including giant planets around stars of later spectral types , which are transitting .",
    "our approach includes the calculation of updated sizes for the cli - hzs following work by @xcite , and most importantly , the role of uv due to the stellar photospheric radiation based on the approach of paper  i. additionally , we explore the uv - hz for the various systems , previously introduced by @xcite , which is found to be about 1.5 times as large as the ghz , but smaller than the ehz as adopted here . motivated by earlier studies , as ,",
    "e.g. , the work by @xcite , dna is taken as a proxy for carbon - based macromolecules following the paradigm that extraterrestrial biology may be most likely based on hydrocarbons ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the dna action spectrum is utilized to represent the impact of the stellar uv radiation ; this allows us to assess different systems with or without the consideration of atmospheric attenuation .",
    "however , no calculation of damage is made for wavelength below 200  nm , mostly because no data for action spectra for dna or other relevant biomolecules could be located for that regime .",
    "even though the properties of possible exomoon atmospheres in the mid- and far - uv regime are unknown , f - star photospheres are expected to be significant emitters down to @xmath40160  nm or more ( depending on their temperature and activity range ) , as previously pointed out by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another import aspect concerns the impact of stellar evolution and the associated stability of the cli - hzs ; both are largely determined by the stellar mass  see paper  i for details .",
    "most stars of our sample have masses between 1.1 and 1.3  @xmath1 .",
    "the most massive star is hd  86264 with a mass of about 1.42  m@xmath84 @xcite . according to paper  i",
    ", this star should be able to maintain its chz and ghz for about 2.1 and 2.9 gyr , respectively ; these values are commensurate to its age .",
    "stars with masses of 1.1 , 1.2 , and 1.3  @xmath1 ( the majority of our target stars ) possess chzs for timespans of 3.45 , 3.1 , and 2.7  gyr , respectively , with the duration of the ghzs increased by a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 .",
    "these timescales are notably shorter than for the sun ; however , geochemical results for earth by , e.g. , @xcite and most recently by @xcite based on the analysis of microbial structures have convincingly shown that the origin of terrestrial life dates back to 3.8  gyr ( or longer ) , indicating that life might in principle be able to start a few hundred millions of years after the formation of the hosting object .",
    "this implies that even f - type stars should in general be able to provide habitable environments .",
    "moreover , even for stars like hd  25171 and hd  153950 , which already have left the main - sequence , the provision of biospheric environments might still be possible as planets or moons originally located outside of the cli - hzs might subsequently be able to move in , which is consistent with the cases studied here . this possibility is known as cold - start solution for habitability , as pointed out by @xcite and others .    the exomoons , if existing , are considered to be in close proximity to the jupiter - type planets ; therefore , the orbits of these planets are decisive for assessing the general prospects of habitability . the uv exposures of the exomoons vary according to the changes in the star ",
    "planet distances dictated by the ellipticity of the planetary orbits .",
    "for example , it is found that the exoplanets hd  169830c and @xmath2  and  ad stay within the cli - hz at all times , if the most extended limits are assumed .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2  and  ad also remains in the uv - hz all the time ; however , the other exoplanets do not .",
    "moreover , hd  8673b and hd  86264b make significant excursions beyond both the inner and outer limits of the cli - hz even if the most extended limits are considered . this behavior may nullify the exomoon s potential for habitability depending on its atmospheric and geological conditions , even though limited excursions from the cli - hz may be permissible , especially for objects of thick atmospheres , as argued by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite explored habitability of water - limited objects , sometimes referred to as land - worlds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and found that they could remain habitable much closer to the stars , a result relevant for the systems hd  8673 , hd  33564 , hd  86264 , 30  ari  b , and hd  153950 .",
    "uv habitability in the context of this study has been measured by @xmath3 , defined as the ratio of damage for a given distance from the star for an object with or without atmospheric attenuation , as chosen by the model , relative to the damage for an object at 1  au from a solar - like star without atmospheric attenuation .",
    "inspections of our results show that for the hypothetical exomoon environments of the stars hd  8673 and hd  86264 , in the absence of atmospheric attenuation , the highest values for @xmath3 are attained , given as about 14 and 15 , respectively , which apply to the periapsis positions of the jupiter - type planets .",
    "relative decent values of 2.1 ( maximum value ) and 0.5 ( persistent value ) are found for the hypothetical exomoon environments of hd  169830 and hd  25171 , respectively .",
    "all values of @xmath3 , including the exceptionally high values , are drastically reduced if atmospheric attenuation is applied , as identified for earth , and as suggested for other objects beyond the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our study shows that the damage inflicted on dna exhibit a large range of values compared to an earth - type planet at earth - equivalent ( i.e. , homeothermic ) positions in the solar system .",
    "typically , these values are relatively high , especially is at periapsis position . however",
    ", appropriate protection due to atmospheric attenuation can dramatically increase the chances of providing habitable environments , which indicates another strong motivation for the continuation of exoplanet and exomoon focused atmospheric investigations .",
    "current results have been given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , among others .",
    "considering that the detection of exomoons around different types of stars ( including g , k , and m dwarfs as well as regarding planets in transit ) will remain challenging in the foreseeable future , we view our work also as a template for future investigation of habitability . among other criteria",
    ", the joint consideration of the stellar cli - hz and uv - hz appears to be of particular importance .",

    "<S> we explore the astrobiological significance of f - type stars of spectral type between f5  v and f9.5  v , which possess jupiter - type planets within or close to their climatological habitable zones . </S>",
    "<S> these planets , or at least a subset of those , may also possess rocky exomoons , which potentially offer habitable environments . </S>",
    "<S> our work considers eight selected systems . </S>",
    "<S> the jupiter - type planets in these systems are in notably differing orbits with eccentricities between 0.08 ( about mars ) and 0.72 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the stellar uv environments provided by the photospheric stellar radiation , which allows us to compute the uv habitable zones for the systems . </S>",
    "<S> following previous studies , dna is taken as a proxy for carbon - based macromolecules following the paradigm that extraterrestrial biology might be based on hydrocarbons . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the damage inflicted on dna is notably different for the range of systems studied , and also varies according to the orbit of the jupiter - type planet , especially for systems of high ellipticity , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> for some systems excessive values of damage are attained compared to today s earth or during the archean eon . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the detection of exomoons around different types of stars will remain challenging in the foreseeable future , we view our work also as an example and template for investigating the combined requirements of climatological and uv - based habitability for exosolar objects . </S>"
