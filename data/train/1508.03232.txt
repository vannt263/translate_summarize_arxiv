    "non - abelian monopoles are smooth , static , finite - energy solutions to the yang - mills - higgs equations with non - abelian gauge group .",
    "it was first noticed by t hooft and polyakov that to a distant observer they resemble dirac monopoles in an abelian gauge theory @xcite .",
    "thus the singularity of the dirac monopole can be smoothed out in non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "t hooft defined @xcite an asymptotic abelian magnetic field of a non - abelian monopole with gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "the flux of this magnetic field through the two - sphere at infinity is topologically quantised and non - zero .",
    "however , in the core of the monopole this magnetic field is singular @xcite , and the magnetic charge distribution which induces it typically has delta - function singularities .",
    "thus , while a non - abelian monopole is smooth , the magnetic charge distribution associated to t hooft s magnetic field is far from being smooth .",
    "as has been argued by coleman @xcite , there is no reason to expect the abelian magnetic field of a non - abelian monopole to be uniquely defined : any magnetic field which agrees with t hooft s asymptotically is an equally viable candidate .",
    "however , to date no definition of a magnetic field has been proposed which smoothes out the singularities in t hooft s field . in this article",
    "we remedy this situation : we propose a novel definition of the magnetic charge density of a non - abelian monopole which , unlike t hooft s charge density , is smooth .",
    "moreover , we show that the magnetic field induced by this charge density agrees with t hooft s asymptotically , at least in the case of bps monopoles .",
    "our charge density is evaluated by summing the squared norms of zero - modes of a dirac operator . in this way it resembles the trace of the bergman kernel used in khler geometry , which is a sum of squared norms of zero - modes of a cauchy - riemann operator .",
    "the proof that our charge density induces the correct asymptotic magnetic field is based on much of the mathematical formalism that has been developed to study bps monopoles , including the nahm transform and spectral curves .",
    "a prominent role is played by a function which we call the _ tail _ of the monopole .",
    "this function describes the asymptotics of the higgs field and was first studied by hurtubise @xcite .",
    "we have observed that this tail function can in many cases be calculated explicitly , which is remarkable given the paucity of explicit monopole solutions",
    ". another interesting consequence of our work is a proof of a conjecture @xcite relating conserved charges of the nahm equation to asymptotics of an associated greens function .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review standard results relating moments of electric ( or magnetic ) charge distributions to the asymptotics of the electric ( or magnetic ) fields that they induce . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce our charge density and show that its integral agrees with the magnetic flux through the two - sphere at infinity . the proof that the magnetic field induced by this charge density agrees asymptotically with t hooft s proceeds in two parts : in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we show that the moments of the charge density equal certain conserved quantities of the nahm equation , and section [ sec5 ] we show using hurtubise work on the tail function that these conserved quantities also prescribe the asymptotic expansion of t hooft s magnetic field . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we present some explicit calculations of the tail function .",
    "we discuss promising extensions of this work in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "it is well - known that the moments of a distribution of electric charge determine the asymptotic expansion of the induced electric field @xcite .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 be a smooth function that decays exponentially as @xmath2 and let @xmath3 be a potential of the induced electric field @xmath4 .",
    "the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are related by @xmath7suppose that @xmath6 has an expansion in powers of @xmath0 of the form @xmath8 the functions @xmath9 must then be spherical harmonics of weight @xmath10 , as @xmath11 decays exponentially .",
    "the expansion is called the multipole expansion of @xmath6 .",
    "write @xmath12 and for each @xmath13 let @xmath14 be the polynomial @xmath15 the @xmath16 coefficients of @xmath14 are moments of the distribution @xmath5 .",
    "they determine , and are determined by , the spherical harmonics @xmath9 . more precisely :",
    "[ prop : moments asymptotics ] let @xmath5 be an exponentially decaying function and let @xmath6 solve @xmath17 , such that @xmath6 has an expansion in powers of @xmath0 of the form . then the coefficients of this expansion and the moments of @xmath5 satisfy the identities @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is a polynomial in @xmath20 whose coefficients are spherical functions , and @xmath21 is a small contour which circles the point @xmath22    although the equivalence of the moments and the spherical harmonics @xmath9 is a standard result , we present a brief proof of equations and , as our notation ( in particular our choice of parameterising the moments using a polynomial ) is non - standard .    the proof of rests on the fact that the coefficents of @xmath23 solve the laplace equation",
    "this fact follows by induction from the following two identities , which are easily verified : @xmath24 integrating the right hand side of by parts twice and substituting the series expansion for @xmath6 then yields @xmath25 since @xmath26 , the coefficients of @xmath27 are spherical harmonics of weight @xmath10 .",
    "now spherical harmonics of different weights are @xmath28-orthogonal , so the integral over @xmath29 appearing in the preceding expression vanishes unless @xmath30 .",
    "thus the expression reduces to the stated result .",
    "the second identity follows from the first via representation theory .",
    "the space of spherical harmonics of weight @xmath10 and the space of degree @xmath31 polynomials both carry representations of @xmath32 : it is easily checked that the operators @xmath33 obey the @xmath32 commutation relations , @xmath34&=\\pm{{\\rm i}}l_\\pm & [ l_+,l_-]&=2{{\\rm i}}l_0 \\\\ [ j^{(\\ell)}_0,j^{(\\ell)}_\\pm]&=\\pm{{\\rm i}}j^{(\\ell)}_\\pm & [ j^{(\\ell)}_+,j^{(\\ell)}_-]&=2{{\\rm i}}j^{(\\ell)}_0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these representations are all irreducible .",
    "equations and define maps between the spaces of spherical harmonics of weight @xmath10 and the space of degree @xmath31 polynomials , and we aim to show that these maps are inverse to each other .",
    "the maps respect the action of @xmath32 , in the sense that @xmath35 their composition is a linear map from the space of spherical harmonics of weight @xmath10 to itself that commutes with the action of @xmath32 . by schur s lemma ,",
    "this map is equivalent to multiplication by a constant , so we only need to show that this constant is 1 .",
    "we can do so by showing that the map fixes just one element .",
    "we choose the element @xmath36 . according to eq .",
    "the associated polynomial is @xmath37 we now evaluate the right hand side of eq .   with this particular @xmath38 .",
    "in order to evaluate the contour integral we factorise the denominator : we find that @xmath39 and thus that @xmath40 only the @xmath41 term in this laurent series contributes to the integral , so @xmath42 this equals the original function @xmath9 , so eq",
    ".   follows from eq .   as claimed .",
    "the yang - mills higgs energy for an @xmath32 gauge field @xmath43 and adjoint scalar @xmath44 on euclidean @xmath45 is @xmath46 { { \\rm d}}^3x,\\ ] ] in which @xmath47 is a parameter and @xmath48 .",
    "a monopole is a finite - energy solution of its euler - lagrange equations satisfying the boundary condition @xmath49 the asymptotic scalar field of a monopole defines a map from the 2-sphere at infinity to the unit sphere in @xmath32 , and the topological charge of the monopole is the winding number @xmath50 of this map .    the non - vanishing asymptotic value for @xmath51 breaks the gauge symmetry from su(2 ) to u(1 ) .",
    "motivated by this , t hooft proposed @xcite the following definition of the asymptotic abelian magnetic field of a monopole : @xmath52 another commonly accepted definition for the abelian magnetic field is @xcite @xmath53 the equations of motion imply that this magnetic field differs from t hooft s only by terms which decay exponentially , so these two magnetic fields share the same asymptotic expansion . both magnetic fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 have singularities at points where @xmath56 .    the total magnetic charge @xmath57 of the monopole is defined to be the flux of @xmath54 ( or equivalently , of @xmath55 ) through the 2-sphere at infinity .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath58 , so the magnetic charge is topologically quantised .",
    "it is common in the study of monopoles to introduce two twisted dirac operators with real parameter @xmath59 : @xmath60 these act on @xmath28-normalisable spinors transforming in the fundamental representation of su(2 ) .",
    "let @xmath61 be a basis for the space of solutions to @xmath62 , let @xmath63 be a basis for the space of solutions to @xmath64 , and suppose that these bases are both orthonormal : @xmath65 we propose @xmath66 as a definition of the magnetic charge density of a monopole .",
    "note that this does not depend on the choice of orthonormal bases @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this density is not unique , as it depends on the parameter @xmath69",
    ". it will be demonstrated below that , although the densities @xmath70 may differ , they induce the same asymptotic magnetic field , with the consequence that all values of @xmath59 yield equally viable charge densities @xmath70",
    ". however , if a unique charge density was required then @xmath71 seems the most natural choice .",
    "note that all of the densities @xmath70 decay exponentially in @xmath72 .",
    "the first requirement of any putative magnetic charge density is that its integral should equal the total magnetic charge @xmath73 as viewed from infinity .",
    "our proposed density meets this requirement : the normalisation conditions above imply that @xmath74 and an index theorem guarantees that @xmath75 .",
    "thus the topological nature of the magnetic charge is made manifest through the index theorem .",
    "a more sophisticated requirement of a magnetic charge density is that the moments of the density agree with the multipole expansion of the magnetic field in the manner described in the previous section .",
    "the main result of this paper is that our proposed density meets this requirement , at least in the case of bps monopoles .",
    "bps monopoles with @xmath76 are solutions of the first order equation @xmath77 and the boundary condition @xmath78 they solve the second order euler - lagrange equations for the yang - mills - higgs energy in the limiting case where @xmath79 .",
    "the bps equation guarantees that @xmath80 this operator is negative and therefore @xmath81 has no zero - modes @xmath68 .",
    "therefore our definition of the magnetic charge density reduces in the case of bps monopoles to @xmath82    bps monopoles can be completely constructed through the formalism of the nahm transform @xcite .",

    "these conserved quantities are in fact equal to the moments of the density , as the following proposition shows :    [ prop : moments charges ] the moments of the charge density of a bps monopole and the conserved charges of its associated nahm data satisfy @xmath89    before presenting the proof we note that this implies that the moments of the charge distribution @xmath70 are independent of @xmath59 .",
    "this is why we believe all of the densities @xmath70 are equally viable candidates for a magnetic charge density . for future reference , we denote these moments by @xmath90    the identity will be proved from standard identities for green s functions .",
    "let @xmath91 be the green s function for @xmath92 , i.e. the @xmath93 matrix - valued function which solves @xmath94 for convenience we introduce the notation @xmath95 the following identity is well - known ( cf .  equation ( 4.35 ) , ( 4.36 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath96    we will use induction and this identity to prove the statement @xmath97 from which our main result follows .    the case @xmath98 of follows directly from the normalisation of the fermion zero modes .",
    "suppose then that ( [ 2 ] ) holds in the case @xmath30 for some @xmath99 .",
    "we will show that it must also hold in the case @xmath100 .",
    "appealing to the greens function identity and integrating by parts yields : @xmath101 observe that @xmath102=\\sigma(\\zeta)=\\left[d_s,\\overline{x(\\zeta)}\\right]^\\dagger$ ] , where @xmath103 since in addition @xmath104 , the unwanted second term on the right equates to @xmath105 this expression vanishes , because @xmath106 .",
    "therefore the identity holds in the case @xmath100 , and for all @xmath107 by the principle of mathematical induction .",
    "in the case of bps monopoles the norm of the scalar field @xmath44 provides a scalar potential for the asymptotic magnetic field : it is easily shown using that @xmath108 .",

    "then the asymptotic expansions of @xmath120 and @xmath122 agree to all orders .",
    "the physical interpretation of this theorem is that the multipole expansion of the magnetic field induced by @xmath70 agrees with that of the magnetic field @xmath54 defined in .",
    "the tail is automatically harmonic almost everywhere , as follows from the formalism of the penrose transform .",
    "therefore it admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath0 of the form @xmath123 in which @xmath124 are spherical harmonics of weight @xmath10 . by hurtubise theorem [ thm : hurtubise ]",

    "in @xcite it was conjectured that the asymptotic expansion for @xmath137 is determined to all orders by the conserved quantities @xmath110 of the nahm equation .",

    "in general reconstructing a monopole from its nahm data is a difficult problem . in this section",
    "we show that the tail , and hence the asymptotics , of a monopole can straightforwardly be evaluated from its spectral curve or the conserved tensors of the nahm equation .",

    "<S> unlike the standard definition of the charge density , this density is smooth in the core of the monopole . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this charge density induces a magnetic field whose expansion in powers of @xmath0 agrees with that of the conventional asymptotic magnetic field to all orders . </S>",
