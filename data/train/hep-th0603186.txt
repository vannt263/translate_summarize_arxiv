    "one may note that , for example , the @xmath1 gauge bosons in conventional georgi  glashow @xmath2 unification @xcite have the correct colors and weak isospins @xmath3 , as ( s)quarks . of course they do not have the desired @xmath4 hypercharges , but provided that they are also charged under additional @xmath4 symmetries , after diagonal symmetry breaking they may have the correct quantum numbers .",
    "we first investigate this possibility : embedding all the mssm fields into the _ @xmath0 adjoints _ , which are the only representations predicted by type i string theory . clearly , however , we require much bigger group than georgi  glashow @xmath2 .",
    "the ingredients are extra dimensions and magnetic fluxes , which is equivalent to intersecting branes at angles .",
    "masslessness and chirality come from zero modes of dirac operator .    a supporting evidence of this picture is suggested in the dual _ m / f_-theory compactification @xcite .",
    "the intersection of d6 branes is purely geometrically described as unwinding of @xmath5 singularity to @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the bifundamental fermions come from the branching of the adjoint @xmath8 where we should count only one bifundamental because the other is @xmath9 conjugate . in the intersecting brane picture ,",
    "a string stretched from @xmath10 brane stack to @xmath11 brane stack corresponds to _ chiral _ bifundamental representation @xmath12 , and the other string having the opposite orientation is @xmath9 conjugate due to the opposite gso projection @xcite .    consider a toy model .",
    "the gauge group @xmath13 arises from breaking an unified group @xmath14 whose adjoint have the following charge assignment under the above subgroup @xmath15 , @xmath16 where the notations are self - explanatory ; the block - diagonal numbers refer to the dimensions of gauge bosons , and off - diagonal blocks correspond to complex squarks and sleptons and hermitian conjugates .",
    "we will see the fields corresponding to blank entries are massive .",
    "they have the correct quantum numbers , as well as hypercharge defined as linear combinations @xmath17 this breaking is achieved by the following background magnetic flux @xmath18}$ ] on the extra two - torus @xmath19 , @xmath20 here gcd@xmath21 are @xmath22 , respectively , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 will be interpreted as regge slope . in compactification with more dimensions",
    ", we may put some of the blocks to different gauge field components than @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "most of all , the theory is _ chiral _ @xcite .",
    "this means , for example either quark @xmath26 or antiquark @xmath27 in ( [ su7adj ] ) will be exclusively massless .",
    "this can be seen by index theorem .",
    "the dirac operator is decomposed as @xmath28 and , for @xmath29 extra dimensions , the chirality is correlated .",
    "the difference of the number of left and right mover zero modes , is the first chern number , @xmath30 where the trace is over gauge charge @xmath31 of commutant group @xmath32 to @xmath15 , completely determined by branching . plugging ( [ toybg ] )",
    ", we see that the each quark and lepton is chiral .",
    "moreover , there are @xmath33 degenerate bifundamental solutions for each off - diagonal solution .",
    "one can confirm that this is the same as intersection number @xmath34 of d - branes , which can explain the number of generations .",
    "it is determined by the topology of extra dimensions .",
    "note that gauge bosons of @xmath15 are always massless , nonchiral and non - degenerate .",
    "such a constant magnetic flux @xmath35 is understood , in the @xmath36-dual space , as linearly growing vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of adjoint scalar field @xmath37 up to a gauge choice , describing tilted brane with respect to coordinate axis .",
    "the boundary condition of torus requires @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "these numbers @xmath21 correspond to winding numbers ( homology cycles ) of d - branes .",
    "these patterns of symmetry breaking are achieved via two kinds of mechanism , in the brane language :    * parallel separation of stacks : the constant part * partial brane stack `` rotation '' : the linear part    cf .",
    "eq ( [ toybg ] ) .",
    "the first is what we usually have in higgs mechanism with a constant adjoint vev @xmath39 @xcite : all the fields corresponding to off - diagonal entries get massive .",
    "the second is described by developing constant _ flux _ on gauge field strength @xmath40 the resulting unbroken symmetry is the one commutes with ( [ growvev ] ) . by the mechanism",
    "discussed , only the fermions with one chirality survive , which is determined by the orientation of flux or brane rotation .",
    "in fact the continuous rotation is not possible , because the quantization condition of @xmath21 . by `` rotation '' we mean recombination which we will discuss shortly .",
    "the example ( [ su7adj ] ) thus is obtained as follows , where @xmath36-dual picture is more transparent .",
    "start with 7 slices of coincident branes , separate stacks with @xmath41 branes .",
    "then after rotating @xmath42 and @xmath43 branes , we obtain chiral spectrum .",
    "one can check @xcite that the commuting generators of @xmath44 represents unbroken gauge group and chiral quarks and leptons , exclusively not paired with the charge conjugate , indicated in ( [ su7adj ] ) .",
    "we will generalize this argument to @xmath29 extra dimensions , among them our interest is six .",
    "we have seen that it is easy to obtain chiral fermion zero mode , but only with supersymmetry the massless boson exists as superpartner .",
    "the supersymmetry condition is moduli dependent .",
    "in fact , for the case of 2 extra dimensions , there can never be massless scalar . in what follows , we will consider higher dimensional theory and rotation _ preserving supersymmetry . _",
    "the above toy model is anomalous .",
    "the best explanation for an anomaly free theory is that it is spontaneously broken phase of a unified theory , where the absence of anomaly is natural .",
    "the most suggestive scenario will be ten dimensional supergravity with nonabelian gauge group @xmath0 , which is the only anomaly free theory if we want the perturbative open string description .",
    "symmetries are broken by projections associated with the compactification . in the brane picture ,",
    "consistency is given by ramond ",
    "ramond ( rr ) tadpole cancellation condition .",
    "it guarantees anomaly freedom of nonabelian gauge anomalies and of other mixed anomalies involving @xmath4 s by the generalized green  schwarz ( gs ) mechanism from antisymmetric tensor fields .    for this",
    "we introduce an orientifold plane ( o - plane ) having opposite rr charges to d - branes .",
    "this will set an upper bound of the rank of the gauge group .",
    "this is obtained by compounding worldsheet parity reversal @xmath45 and spatial reflection , under which o - plane is fixed .",
    "this brings about mirror fermion having charge @xmath12 for @xmath46 corresponding to mirror cycles . when a brane and its image brane are on top of orientifold plane , the gauge group is @xmath47 type .",
    "the symmetry breaking @xmath48 is again described by parallel separation .",
    "the @xmath49 block matrix @xmath50 plays the role of imaginary number , determined by chan  paton projector . for example , the above @xmath51 toy model is realized and embedded in @xmath52 , having almost same structure .",
    "since the final group is @xmath0 , inevitably we have hidden sector @xcite .    during the compactification",
    ", we may meet more than one gauge groups thus as many adjoints , depending on the number of o - planes , so all the quarks and leptons are not necessarily belong to the same adjoint .",
    "the above gauge symmetry breaking is studied as deformations of branes , `` brane recombinations '' .",
    "mainly it has been discussed in non - supersymmetric theory in the context of tachyon condensation .",
    "however we want supersymmetry preserving recombination . in the brane picture ,",
    "the supersymmetry exists when the cycles belong to @xmath53 holonomy special lagrangian .",
    "the supersymmetry - preserving deformation is parameterized by wilson lines , as a special case of mclean s theorem @xcite . in particular , turning on off - diagonal components changes the cycle and `` rotates '' the brane .",
    "in other words , although we can not continuously change the linear entries in ( [ toybg ] ) due to integral quantization condition of @xmath54 , we can change them `` effectively '' @xcite .",
    "it is because the corresponding fields to off - diagonal components are charged under the subgroup @xmath32 , which breaks @xmath55 down to the commutant @xmath15 . in this sense ,",
    "the description as ( [ toybg ] ) is _ far from complete_. the proper description comes with coherent sheaves in k - theory @xcite , and we just use it as the resulting `` effective '' phase of broken theory .    in any recombinations , in fact in any interactions of d - branes",
    ", rr charges should be conserved .",
    "it means every recombination takes place preserving the _ anomaly content .",
    "_ when we survey @xmath56 term of chern class as in ( [ diracidx ] ) , it is invariant under brane recombinations .",
    "since we are considering @xmath29 dimensions , an adjoint ( before recombination ) , as well as chiral fermions , contributes chiral anomaly .",
    "after symmetry breaking , this number is invariant . as long as tadpole is cancelled",
    ", there is no chiral anomalies in the low energy limit .    )",
    "thus there is no energy cost on deformation.,height=75 ]    to be specific , let us consider d6 branes in type iia theory .",
    "we consider a `` 1/4''(bps)-cycle , where only two cycle is wrapping nontrivially on four torus @xmath57 in , say , 4567 direction and the remaining one cycle is along the o - plane in 89 direction .",
    "now consider a recombination @xcite @xmath58 in the presence of o - planes , we can choose two cycles as being _ always the images with respect to an o - plane _ , here ( 1,0)(1,0)(1,0 ) , and this reflection symmetry is always preserved .",
    "supersymmetry ( seen by worldsheet spectum ) requires the intersecting angles to be same @xmath59 , which translates to @xmath60 which the above cycles satisfy .",
    "we observe the preserved supersymmetry component @xmath61 @xmath62 is same for every intermediate step .",
    "it is because this relation is local , so that at every point of intermediate brane state this condition is satisfied .",
    "since supersymmetry is preserved , there is no energy cost on `` marginal '' deformation .",
    "we can verify it by explicit dbi energy relation from the above supersymmetry condition @xmath63 with @xmath64 being d@xmath65 brane tension and @xmath66 volume of @xmath67th two - torus . in @xmath36-dual picture in @xmath68 directions , the second line shows that the setup , before and after recombination , has exactly the same energy as d5 branes on top of d9 branes , aligned on top of o - planes , which is again in the original picture : all the intersecting d6s _ along the o - planes_. therefore the energy of branes , before and after recombinations , are _ same . _",
    "the interpolating dynamics is @xmath36-dual to d0-d4 bound state , or instanton obeying peroidicity `` toron . ''",
    "the deformation freedom in this example corresponds to the two @xmath69 instanton moduli space @xcite .",
    "although we have seen that there is a recombination process that deforms intersecting branes to parallel ones , gauge coupling changes during this process .",
    "the four dimensional gauge coupling is proportional to @xmath70 for each stack , with a background flux @xmath35 provided by @xmath36-dual picture of branes , which can be seen by expanding fluctuation around these flux @xmath71 and reading off ym coupling by canonical noramlization @xcite .",
    "this is an unique property of dbi action which is not present in ym description . thus below the compactification",
    "scale the intersecting branes does not give unified coupling , in general .",
    "this does not conflicts with neither energy costless deformation since it is the dynamics of extra dimensions , nor unification picture above unification scale . in the four dimensional effective theory ,",
    "running from the low energy , the gauge coupling unification is modified by large threshold correction around unfication scale .",
    "the backgroun value @xmath72 above is order of compactification scale .",
    "this means the fluctuation is not small any more compared to the background , and above unification scale opens up extra dimensions with the usual unified gauge coupling from type i string .",
    "the above d0-d4 bound state is @xmath73-dual to ( f , d@xmath65 ) bound state which is interpreted as the electric flux on d - branes @xcite .",
    "the above bps equation becomes string junction condition @xcite and we can clearly see the supersymmetry condition at every local point , with the same supersymmetry components preserved . in this picture",
    "we can also see the no - energy - cost property under marginal deformation and the specific shape of final state @xcite .",
    "the dbi energy is @xmath74 when we have purely magnetic flux , this is nothing but the winding volume of torus @xmath75 , agreeing with intersecting brane case .",
    "but when we have contribution from fundamental string , which carries ns - ns flux , which is equivalent to electric field component .",
    "the size of electric and magnetic fluxes should be equal due to bps condition , so the determinant becomes 1 , which shows independence of cycle .",
    "another description is from the algebraic geometry @xcite .",
    "such special lagrangian configuration is described by algebraic variety and deformation is described by interpolating curve .",
    "all the above 1/4-cycles can be embedded into complex curves , which are always special lagrangian cycles in two complex dimension .    for less symmetric cycles such as 1/8 cycles",
    ", there still be the recombination process , which is also marginal , protected by supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "however in this case , the parallel brane state has more supersymmetry , namely 1/4 bps .",
    "we recall that in the nonsupersymmetric case , a runaway minimum has a recovered supersymmetry .",
    "it is clear that the conservation of rr charge should drive the state again to that with parallel branes all on top of orientifold planes .    when more than one adjoint higgs assume vevs , in general the rank of the gauge group reduces .",
    "an important application is the electroweak higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "it occurs when the bifundamental higgs assumes constant vev , which corresponds to assigning off - diagonal vevs to original adjoint representation ( [ su7adj ] ) , in the position of @xmath76 .",
    "finally we argue that all the susy type i / ii orientifold models constructed so far be continuously connected , by above deformations and @xmath36-duality , _ to type i theory compactified on orbifold_. the vital constraint is rr tadpole cancellation condition .",
    "to cancel tadpole , it is crucial that every construction requires _ at least one _ orientifold plane o@xmath65 as a negatively rr charged object .",
    "this can always be converted to o9 plane by @xmath36-duality .",
    "in general , an orientifold group is generated by orbifold actions @xmath77 and worldsheet parity reversals @xmath78 , where @xmath79 are spatial reflections of compact @xmath80 directions and @xmath81 is the spacetime fermion number .",
    "this o@xmath65 plane is lying on the fixed plane under @xmath82 . by the @xmath36-dual @xmath83",
    ", we can always convert it to @xmath45 , while orbifold group @xmath84 is untouched . the type iib theory with orientifold element @xmath45 is type i theory , so that every theory containing orientifold is regarded as compactification of type i string theory with @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that the _ orbifold group @xmath84 _ completely determines additional orientifolds and thus gauge group .    fixing one orientifold as o9 , let us then count the lower dimensional orientifolds . consider a @xmath85 orbifold @xcite . for odd @xmath11 ,",
    "the only possible orientifold is o9 since there is no even order element in @xmath84 compatible with lower dimensional orientifold . for even @xmath11 , the only possibility other than o9 is o5 , because in order not to have a tachyon , the difference of dimensions of d",
    "- branes should be a multiple of 4 .",
    "we can not put an additional o1 , if we want four dimensional lorentz invariance .",
    "the number of o5 is always 1 , and it sits on the plane generated by order 2 element @xmath86 .",
    "note that if this orientifold group element @xmath87 exists , introducing o5 is compulsory , which would be absent in the untwisted theory .",
    "the same is also applied to @xmath88 orbifolds , where the number of o5 can be up to 3 .",
    "other systems containing o@xmath65,d@xmath65 and/or o@xmath89,d@xmath89 can be @xmath36-dualized to the above models .",
    "one can see , for example , the model in @xcite is deformable to the one in @xcite , both of which are based on @xmath90 orbifold . in the latter picture , orbifold actions determine three @xmath91 dimensional hyperplanes and harbor o - planes .",
    "with chan  paton projectors , the resulting gauge group consists of @xmath92 , which is embedded in @xmath0 , for each o5 plane .",
    "@xmath0 because the product of the rr charge of o@xmath65 and the number of fixed points is always 16 . in the maximal group case ( without wilson lines , or when all the d - branes are on top of one orientifold planes ) we have only gauge group @xmath93 which will be the final unficiation group obtainable from brane deformations .",
    "nevertheless they are to be regarded as _ broken @xmath94 _ because the resulting 99 and @xmath95 spectra in @xcite can be explained by branching rules @xmath96 .",
    "note also we have @xmath36-dual symmetries exchanging o9 with any of the o5@xmath97 .",
    "therefore every gauge group arising from d@xmath65-d@xmath65 branes can be _ embedded into @xmath0 , for each orientifold plane_. as a bonus , we see the @xmath92 group describing small instantons @xcite is embedded into @xmath0 , too .",
    "applying @xmath36-dualities in @xmath68 directions we have four o6s . by brane deformations , we can see the spectrum of @xcite can be obtained from this .",
    "we can always find the directions in which @xmath36-duality maps all o9,d9,o5,d5 to six dimensional objects : o6 and d6 .",
    "therefore we can lift of the model to @xmath10-theory on @xmath98 manifold picture , where the desirable objects are six dimensional objects in type iia theory , which become geometric objects , i.e. singularities .",
    "one may note that not every vacuum might be connected , since the deformation of orbifold / orientifold images should be always deformed together .",
    "however it is strongly restricted by anomaly cancelation of representations of @xmath99 @xcite .",
