    "dwarf novae ( dn ) systems contain a white dwarf ( wd ) accreting matter at time - averaged rates @xmath5 from a low - mass ( @xmath6 typically ) stellar companion ( see osaki 1996 for an overview ) . at these @xmath3 s ,",
    "the accretion disk is subject to a thermal instability which causes it to rapidly transfer matter onto the wd ( at @xmath7 ) for a few days to a week once every month to year .",
    "the orbital periods of these binaries are usually less than 2 hours ( below the period gap ) , but there are also dn above the period gap , @xmath8 3 hours ( see shafter 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 onto the wd is often low enough between outbursts that the uv emission is dominated by the internal luminosity of the wd .",
    "indeed recent spectroscopy has resolved the wd s contribution to the quiescent light and found effective temperatures @xmath10 ( see sion 1999 ) .    the measured internal wd luminosity is larger than expected from an isolated wd of similar age ( @xmath11 gyr ) , indicating that it has been heated by accretion ( sion 1985 ) .",
    "compressional heating ( i.e. internal gravitational energy release ) appears to be the main driver for this re - heating ( sion 1995 ) .",
    "sion s ( 1995 ) estimate for internal gravitational energy release within the wd ( of mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 ) was @xmath14 .",
    "however , we show in  [ sec : physics ] that the energy release actually depends on the thermal state of the wd interior and that the dominant energy release is in the accreted outer envelope , giving @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean molecular weight of the accreted material , @xmath17 is the wd core temperature , @xmath18 is the baryon mass , and @xmath19 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the theoretical challenge that we address in  [ sec : tcmethod ] is how to calculate @xmath17 as a function of @xmath3 , and thus find @xmath2 .",
    "because of unstable nuclear burning and the resulting classical novae cycle , the h",
    "/ he envelope mass changes with time , allowing the core to cool at low accumulated masses and be heated prior to unstable ignition . we use nova ignition to determine the maximum mass of the overlying freshly accreted shell , and find the steady - state ( i.e. cooling equals heating throughout the classical novae cycle ) core temperature , @xmath17 , as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath12 .",
    "we compare our calculations to hst / stis observations and infer @xmath3 on the timescale of @xmath20 years .",
    "we find that dn above the period gap have @xmath21 , while those below have @xmath22 , consistent with that expected from traditional cv evolution ( e.g. howell , nelson , & rappaport 2001 ) , even those that involve some `` hibernation '' ( shara et al .",
    "1986 ; kolb et al .",
    "the result is more surprising if the much weaker magnetic braking laws of andronov , pinsonneault , & sills ( 2001 ) are correct .",
    "we also predict the minimum light ( @xmath23 ) of cvs in quiescence for a range of @xmath3 , wd mass , and companion mass .",
    "this assists the search for the predicted large population of cvs with very low mass companions ( @xmath24 ) that are near , or past , the period minimum ( howell , rappaport , & politano 1997 ) . observations already show that the wd fixes the quiescent colors of these cvs and our calculations are useful for cv surveys in the field ( e.g. 2df , sdss , see marsh et al .",
    "2001 and szkody et al .  2002 ) and globular clusters .",
    "compressional heating is the energy released by fluid elements as they are compressed by further accretion .",
    "the important feature of this heating mechanism is that the heat is released in the wd _ interior _ , and thus is radiated on a timescale which is longer than the time between dn outbursts .",
    "contrast this to the gravitational potential energy released by the infalling matter , ( @xmath25 per baryon ) which is deposited at , or near , the photosphere and is rapidly radiated away .",
    "such infall energy does not get taken into the star because in the upper atmosphere ( where @xmath26 ) the time it takes the fluid to move inward is much longer ( by at least @xmath27 ) than the time it takes for heat to escape .",
    "this means infall energy is not important for setting the internal thermal state of the wd ; it simply has no influence there .",
    "also , once accretion has diminished for longer than the time to radiate the infall energy away ( such as in dn quiescence ) , it is no longer relevant to the observed luminosity .",
    "an additional energy source in the wd interior is slow nuclear burning near the base of the accreted h / he layer .",
    "this is significant when the accreted layer becomes thick , eventually becoming thermally unstable and leading to a classical nova .",
    "the nova energy is assumed to be radiated away in the explosion , but we have found that slow burning before that point contributes an amount of energy to the wd interior comparable to the energy released by compression .",
    "our calculations take account of both compressional heating and slow nuclear burning to determine the wd s thermal state .",
    "we now sketch how compressional heating is included in our stellar model , demonstrate that heating in the envelope dominates that in the core and estimate its magnitude .",
    "this is a discussion specific to dn with low @xmath3 , and the reader should consult nomoto ( 1982 ) for a complete account .",
    "the simplest estimate of the compressional energy release is the gravitational energy liberated as a fluid element moves down in the wd gravitational field , @xmath28 . in the non - degenerate outer atmosphere , a fluid element moves a distance of order the scale height , @xmath29 , in the time it takes to replace it by accretion , giving @xmath30 .",
    "this exhibits the correct scaling , notably the dependence on @xmath31 which is a contrasting parameter between the accreted h / he envelope and the c / o core .    to calculate the actual heat release we consider the local heat equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the nuclear burning rate , @xmath34 is the entropy , and @xmath35 is the slow downward advection speed from accretion .",
    "the entropy profile is fixed by the temperature gradient needed to carry the luminosity outward and thus we simultaneously solve equation ( [ eq : heateq ] ) with the heat transport equation , using opacities and conductivities from iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) and itoh et al .",
    "( 1983 ) to find the thermal structure of the accreted envelope and the outer edge of the c / o core .",
    "for an analytic understanding , we neglect nuclear burning and @xmath36 and use hydrostatic balance to recast equation ( [ eq : heateq ] ) into @xmath37 entropy decreases inward ( i.e. the envelope and core are not convective ) , so this is an outward @xmath38 . in the non - degenerate envelope , where @xmath39 , one more approximation is necessary to obtain an analytic form . for an atmosphere in which @xmath38 is constant with depth",
    ", the envelope satisfies @xmath40 .",
    "though @xmath38 is not constant here , we use this to get an estimate , integrating down to the isothermal core and finding @xmath41 .",
    "now consider the degenerate c / o core .",
    "for the @xmath3 s and typical @xmath42 wd of interest here , the entropy is in the liquid ions at @xmath43 .",
    "the time it takes to transport heat through the interior is @xmath44 , so the core is isothermal and any compression is far from adiabatic .",
    "considered for more massive type ia progenitors , where the interior undergoes nearly adiabatic compression ( see bravo et al .",
    "due to uncertainty from the classical novae cycle , we do nt know whether the c / o core is secularly increasing in mass , but if it were , almost all of the work of compression goes into increasing the electron fermi energy .",
    "the integrated heat release in the core would then be @xmath45 ( nomoto 1982 ) for a @xmath46 c / o wd , where @xmath47 is the ion mean molecular weight .    due to the mean molecular weight contrast between the accreted envelope and the core , the energy release in the core is about a factor of five smaller than that in the envelope .",
    "thus , for a given amount of compression of the star , the entropy drop for material in the accreted layer is much larger than for material in the core . _ despite its comparatively small mass , the accreted layer is the main source of compressional heating . _",
    "for this initial study , we dropped the time - dependent term in equation ( [ eq : heateq ] ) , and presumed that the c / o core mass was constant throughout the classical nova cycle , thus only accounting for the compressional heating and @xmath33 in the accreted layer .",
    "this method improves on that of iben et al .",
    "( 1992 ) by allowing the accreted envelope mass to change through the @xmath48 year classical nova cycle .",
    "early in the cycle , the mass of the accreted layer is small , compressional heating is small , and the wd cools . later in the cycle ,",
    "the accreted layer becomes thick enough that compressional heating along with slow hydrogen burning releases a sufficient amount of energy to heat the core . as the wd has a large heat capacity , reaching the equilibrium @xmath17 where the heat exchanged between the envelope and core averages to zero over a single classical nova cycle takes @xmath49 years . since",
    "this time is shorter than the time over which @xmath3 changes due to changing orbital period , we construct such equilibrium accretors for a given @xmath12 and @xmath3 .    to do this construction , we first fix @xmath17 at the outer edge of the c / o core at a pressure high enough so that the changing accumulated mass has little direct effect . with a radiative - zero outer boundary condition",
    ", we integrate our structure equations with equation ( [ eq : heateq ] ) to find the thermal state for an @xmath3 and accreted layer mass .",
    "see figure [ fig : t - p ] for examples of the resulting @xmath50-@xmath51 relations .",
    "we then evaluate the luminosity across the chosen location ( the right edge of the plot in figure [ fig : t - p ] ) for different accreted layer masses , up to the unstable ignition which is found by comparing the @xmath50 and @xmath52 at the base of the accreted layer with analytic ignition curves ( fujimoto 1982 ) .",
    "we vary @xmath17 to find an equilibrium model , where the `` core luminosity '' ( @xmath53 ) averages to zero over the classical nova cycle as shown in figure [ fig : loop ] .",
    "the quiescent @xmath2 for the same cycle is also shown in figure [ fig : teff ] . at the nova outburst",
    "we assume that the accreted shell is expelled , and that , due to the rapidity of this event , it does not appreciably heat the wd .",
    "the resulting equilibrium core temperatures for @xmath54 are @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the @xmath59 star is hotter than the @xmath46 star because it has a larger maximum accumulated mass that leads to a longer period of core heating . for a @xmath46 wd , the core temperatures are @xmath60 and 18.0 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath2 during the classical nova cycle varies over a relatively narrow range that allows us to compare to observations . for field cvs ,",
    "the large set of stis observations by szkody et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and previous observations ( urban et al .",
    "2000 ) provide spectra of quiescent wds in dn .",
    "these measurements are made during deep quiescence when the accretion luminosity is negligible and are long enough after the outbursts that other emission mechanisms ( e.g. pringle s ( 1988 ) suggestion of radiative illumination of the wd ) have faded .",
    "the observed @xmath2 s thus measure the heat directly from the wd interior",
    ". this comparison to observations indicates that below the period gap , @xmath63 and the wd masses are in the range @xmath64-@xmath58 .",
    "this agrees with the expectation from kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) , who find @xmath65 at an orbital period of 2 hours presuming angular momentum losses from gravitational waves alone . above the period gap ,",
    "the @xmath2 is higher , and we estimate @xmath66 . for a graphical comparison , see townsley & bildsten ( 2001 ) .",
    "this general agreement with data from field wds in which the internal luminosity is directly visible gives us confidence that our calculations can be applied to other quiescent dn systems .",
    "we predict that a @xmath46 wd above the gap has @xmath67 k and , if in equilibrium below the gap , @xmath68 k. however , if the wd does not have time to cool as it traverses the gap , it will be hotter than our calculation implies .",
    "we estimate this cooling time from the current wd cooling law ( e.g. chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ) , @xmath69 , along with the heat capacity of the core , @xmath70 , giving @xmath71 gyr .",
    "since this is comparable to the estimated time spent in the gap ( howell et al .",
    "2001 ) , our equilibrium assumption below the gap is likely safe .",
    "however , note that about 0.2 gyrs after accretion halts , the wd will enter the zz ceti instability strip !",
    "due to the high frequency of stellar interactions in globular clusters ( gcs ) , an abundant population of cvs is expected to be found there , especially at low @xmath3 .",
    "cvs in gcs are commonly searched for via the presence of hydrogen emission lines or x - ray emission ( as recent chandra observations have found ; grindlay et al .  2001a , grindlay et al .",
    "2001b ) , and this method is fruitful .",
    "we show that these systems ( as well as cvs crossing the period gap or those `` hibernating '' post - novae , shara et al .",
    "1986 ) can also be identified by their position in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . by using our theory of the thermal state of the wd , it is possible to predict the broadband colors of quiescent cvs .",
    "an excellent example is ngc 6397 ( king et al .",
    "1998 ; taylor et al .",
    "figure [ fig : gc ] shows a cmd of ngc 6397 with our initial results .",
    "the data points are objects which meet the proper - motion criteria for cluster membership and which are below the ms .",
    "the lines were produced by superposing a wd with the maximum @xmath2 for the indicated @xmath3 with a ms star .",
    "due to uncertainty in the theory of quiescent disks ( menou 2000 ) , no disk contribution has been added .",
    "note , however , that a constant @xmath72 k disk like those indicated in eclipse maps ( wood & crawford 1986 ) would have a @xmath73 color of 1.24 including the cluster reddening . except for near the wd cooling line ( dashed curve ) , where the wd dominates , the @xmath74 magnitude is set by the ms companion .",
    "the large dots along the @xmath75 and @xmath76 lines indicate where the ms companion is 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.15 and 0.1 @xmath77 , and two additional points at 0.09 and 0.085 @xmath77 are indicated on the @xmath78 line .",
    "this immediately provides a number of candidate systems ( namely , data in this part of the cmd ) .",
    "the circled points are the `` non - flickerers '' ( cool et al .",
    "1998 ) recently reported by taylor et al .",
    "the three at @xmath79 are very strong h@xmath80 absorbers ( consistent with a da wd ) and were not detected by chandra ( grindlay et al .",
    "these authors had discussed these systems as possible helium wds with millisecond pulsar companions , though , given our work , we would claim that these are hot wds with @xmath81 ms companions .",
    "in addition , the population of data points in this diagram with respect to our theoretical curves will eventually constrain cv evolutionary scenarios .",
    "if we assume many of the data points are cvs , we already see that most systems with high @xmath3 have @xmath82 companions .",
    "if confirmed as members of the cluster , the stars below the @xmath83 line could well be the long - sought post - turnaround systems with @xmath84 and companion masses @xmath85 ( howell et al .",
    "we have evaluated the action of compressional heating on accreting wd interiors and shown that most of the compressional energy release takes place in the accreted envelope , and is thermally communicated to the core .",
    "the maximum envelope mass is set by the unstable nuclear burning that causes a classical nova runaway and most likely expels the accreted mass .",
    "we have constructed equilibrium accretors which have constant core temperatures such that the heat lost from the core when the envelope is thin ( i.e. right after the classical nova ) is balanced by that regained when the envelope is thick .",
    "this equilibrium determines the @xmath2 of the wd throughout the classical nova cycle .",
    "our models agree with the observations of dwarf novae in deep quiescence and imply @xmath86 yr@xmath87 just below the period gap and @xmath88 yr@xmath87 just above the period gap for wd masses in the range @xmath64@xmath58 .",
    "our @xmath2 calculations provide a prediction of the colors of quiescent dn . using ms stellar models ,",
    "we have predicted where a dn should appear in a color - magnitude diagram as a function of @xmath3 and the mass of its companion .",
    "many unidentified objects appear in the relevant regions of the detailed cmds which have been obtained for globular clusters by hst .",
    "the number of such systems in the field will increase due to upcoming surveys ( such as sdss and 2df , see marsh et al .",
    "2001 ) , and will push to lower @xmath3 systems .    though our initial efforts have met with apparent success ,",
    "there is still much to be done .",
    "we need to vary the metallicity of the accreted material , lowering to values appropriate for globular cluster science .",
    "this could change our results at large @xmath3 , but at low @xmath3 s , the ignition mass is set by @xmath89 burning and will likely not change too much .",
    "we also need to relax our initial assumptions , e.g. by including wd excavation or accretion and accounting for thermal evolution of the wd .",
    "the internal thermal state of the wd has been a longstanding uncertainty in classical nova work , as has the question of how much mass is ejected in the explosion ( gehrz et al .",
    "our work provides the first calculation of the internal thermal state of a wd undergoing classical novae , and will eventually lead to self consistent calculations for ignition masses , including variations of the metallicity .",
    "this will be an improvement on previous work ( e.g. prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) which treated @xmath17 and @xmath3 as two independent parameters .",
