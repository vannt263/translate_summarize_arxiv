    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots ( qd s ) created at semiconductor interfaces with refined control of their size , shape and number of electrons are often referred @xcite to as `` artificial atoms '' .",
    "this analogy suggests that the physics of electrons in such man - made nanostructures is closely related to that underlying the traditional description @xcite of natural atoms ( pertaining particularly to electronic shells and the aufbau principle ) , where the electrons are taken @xcite to be moving in a spherically averaged effective central mean field ( cmf ) .",
    "however , using as paradigms impurity - doped ( as well as the limiting case of clean ) two - electron - qd ( @xmath0 qd ) analogs to he - like atoms , we show that the interplay between the interelectron repulsion ( @xmath1 ) and the electronic zero - point kinetic energy ( @xmath2 ) may lead , for a broad range of impurity parameters , to spontaneous symmetry - breaking ( sb ) of the self - consistent mean field , resulting at zero magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) in formation of a singlet ground - state electron molecule .",
    "such sb is beyond the cmf picture and , while negligible in the ground state of the he atom ( whose study was central to the development of the quantum theory of matter due to the failure of the bohr - type models @xcite ) , it is similar in nature to the sb found @xcite in the 1970 s in doubly excited he , where formation of an @xmath4-he@xmath5-@xmath4 `` triatomic '' molecule has been invoked .",
    "furthermore , we show that symmetry breaking at @xmath3 of the self - consistent field associated with the triplet excited state of the @xmath0 qd originates from a jahn - teller distortion of the cmf , similar to that underlying formation of nonspherical open - shell nuclei @xcite and metal clusters .",
    "@xcite    along with a unification of concepts pertaining to spontaneous sb in a variety of finite fermionic systems ( from nuclei , metal clusters and natural atoms , to 2d qd s ) , we demonstrate the ability to control the orientation and to manipulate ( i.e. , to enhance , but also to counteract and even to void ) the formation of the electron molecules in 2e qd s via impurity and/or magnetic - field effects .",
    "the ability to control the orientation of the electron molecule may in principle open new possibilities for designing `` on - off '' ( i.e. , switching between two discrete states ) devices , which eventually may be employed in applications of qd s as nanoscale logic gates @xcite ( the effect of impurities on the structure of multi - electron molecules in qd s with more than two electrons is further illustrated in appendix a ) .",
    "that electrons in extended media may undergo crystallization at low densities , when @xmath1 dominates over @xmath2 , has been predicted @xcite by wigner in 1934 . such wigner crystallization ( wc ) in clean qd s results in formation of electron molecules @xcite [ also referred to as wigner molecules ( wm s ) ] , which are associated with spontaneous sb , where the symmetry of the ground state , calculated at the mean - field ( self - consistent - potential ) level , is found to be lower than that of the exact hamiltonian describing the system .",
    "@xcite in clean qd s , formation @xcite of wm s is controlled @xcite by the parameter @xmath6 . for a parabolic confinement ( with frequency @xmath7 ) at @xmath3 , it is customary to take @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dielectric constant and @xmath11 is the spatial extent of the lowest state s wave function of an electron with an effective mass @xmath12 ; wm s occur @xcite for @xmath13 , corresponding to much higher electron densities @xcite than those predicted for wc in an infinite 2d medium .",
    "@xcite    the many - body hamiltonian for a qd with @xmath14 electrons can be expressed as a sum of a single - particle part and the two - particle interelectron coulomb repulsion , @xmath15 the contributions to the single - particle part are written as @xmath16 and they contain a term describing the motion of an electron in a 2d parabolic confinement , i.e. , @xmath17 , where @xmath7 is the frequency of the 2d isotropic harmonic confining potential .",
    "magnetic - field effects are included in @xmath18/2m^ * + g^ * \\mu_b { \\bf b } { \\bf \\cdot } { \\bf s}_i/\\hbar$ ] , where the vector potential , @xmath19 , is taken in the symmetric gauge , and the last term is the zeeman interaction with an effective factor @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the electron spin , and @xmath22 the bohr magneton . to include the effect of ( coulombic ) impurities",
    ", we added to @xmath23 the term @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 is the charge of the @xmath27th impurity located at @xmath28 ; such impurities which in general may be situated out of the 2d plane of the qd ( that is @xmath29 ) may correspond to implanted atoms ( donors or acceptors ) or represent a fabricated , controllable voltage - gate .",
    "a clean qd ( that is with @xmath30 in the above hamiltonian ) may be regarded as a realization of the thomson atom , as are jellium models of metal clusters , @xcite where the positive charge is uniformly distributed ; in the @xmath0 thomson qd ( tqd ) , the confinement to the 2d plane is modeled by a parabolic potential . on the other hand ,",
    "a qd analog of the rutherford model of the atom ( rqd ) , where the positive charges are grouped in a single nucleus , can be achieved through the introduction of a central attractive impurity ( in addition to the harmonic confinement ) .",
    "the presence of many free parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ mbh ] ) and ( [ hi ] ) results in a plethora of possible case studies generated by varying the material dependent parameters ( @xmath10 and @xmath12 ) , the harmonic confinement @xmath7 and the magnetic - field @xmath31 , as well as the number of impurities @xmath27 , their charges @xmath26 , and positions @xmath32 . in this paper , we have chosen to discuss here the following three representative classes of cases at a specific value of @xmath33 , which is sufficientlly high so that the electrons form @xcite a wm in the case of a clean qd , thus allowing for systematic investigations of the effects of impurities on the formation , orientational pinning , and structural distortions of the electron molecules ( for the other parameter values used throughout this paper , see ref .  ) .",
    "the three representative classes , which we discuss , are : ( i ) a 2e tqd at @xmath3 in the presence of two off - centered impurities situated on both sides of the dot ( section ii ) ; ( ii ) a 2e rqd ( with a single attractive central impurity ) in the presence of an applied magnetic field ( for both the cases of a weak and a strong field , section iii ) ; and ( iii ) a qd with eight electrons at @xmath3 and a single impurity with varying strength , polarity , and location ( appendix a ) .    for the case of a clean 2e qd , with the hamiltonian given by eqs.([mbh ] ) and ( [ hi ] ) with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the exact solution can be found quite easily @xcite owing to the separability of the schrdinger equation in the center - of - mass and relative coordinates ; in the presence of impurities , separability is lost and finding an exact solution @xcite becomes significantly more complicated ( even for two electrons in the presence of a central impurity ) . therefore , and also in order to expound the physical principles underlying spontaneous symmetry breaking in qd s , we will mostly use in the following ( sections ii and iii and appendix a ) the self - consistent spin - and - space unrestricted hartree - fock ( ss - uhf ) method @xcite which , unlike the restricted hf ( rhf ) technique , @xcite allows for the formation of broken - symmetry states ( of lower energy than those obtained via the rhf ) .",
    "this ss - uhf , which we introduced for studies of qd s in ref .",
    ", employs @xmath14 ( where @xmath14 is the number of electrons ) orbital - dependent , effective ( mean - field ) potentials and it differs from the usual @xcite rhf in two ways : ( i ) it relaxes the double - occupancy requirement , namely , it employs different spatial orbitals for the two different ( i.e. , the up and down ) spin directions [ dods , thus the designation `` spin ( s ) unresricted '' ] , and ( ii ) it relaxes the requirement that the electron orbitals be constrained by the symmetry of the external confining field [ thus the designation `` space ( s ) unrestricted '' ] .",
    "subsequent to our discussion of symmetry breaking and formation of electron molecules in the framework of the ss - uhf method , we elaborate in section iv on the connection between the symmetry - broken ss - uhf solution and the exact one in the case of a clean 2e qd with @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , analysis of the exact solution using the conditional - probability - distribution ( cpd ) technique @xcite reveals the formation of an electron molecule in agreement with the ss - uhf result .",
    "to introduce some of the principal physical and methodological issues pertaining to symmetry breaking and formation of wigner molecules in finite fermion systems , we discuss first the 2@xmath4 tqd at @xmath3 [ we remind the reader that a sufficiently high value of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) was chosen , such that the qd is in the regime where the two electrons form a wm ; for the other parameters used throughout this paper , see ref .  ] .",
    "the single - particle wave functions ( modulus square ) and total electron densities displayed in fig .",
    "1 are taken from calculations for the 2@xmath4 tqd in the presence of two attractive impurities ( @xmath38 , represented in the figure by filled dots on the two sides of the qd ) located symmetrically about the center of the qd at @xmath39= @xmath40 nm with the strength and location of the impurities purposefully chosen such that they will not affect the nature of the electronic ground states ( for the same qd but without the impurities ) , except for orientational pinning in the case of symmetry - broken states ( see below ) .",
    "constraining first the solution to maintain the symmetry of the hamiltonian , in conjunction with double - occupancy of the hf orbitals by electrons of opposite spins [ that is through the use of the rhf method with input trial electron densities satisfying the symmetry of the external potentials @xcite ] , the resulting symmetry - adapted ( sa ) self - consistent singlet ( @xmath41 ) orbitals and corresponding total density distributions exhibit , as expected , an almost circular symmetry with minimal elliptical distortions ( due to the impurities ) , see fig .",
    "1(a ) ; without the impurities , the sa singlet is perfectly circularly symmetric .",
    "however , increasing the variational freedom through removal of the spatial symmetry and double - occupancy constraints via the use of the ss - uhf method results in a symmetry - broken singlet ground state of lower energy , that is formation of a wm characterized by localized orbitals with the `` bond length '' ( distance between the maxima in the total electronic distribution ) equal to 29 nm [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] ; the energy of this state is lower by 1.62 mev than that of the sa solution [ fig .",
    "this lowering of the ground - state energy reflects gain in correlation energy ( for the definition of correlation energy , see section iv below ) .",
    "note that the 2e wm is orientationally pinned along the interimpurity axis .",
    "similar formation of a wm occurs also for a @xmath0 tqd without the pinning impurities ( with an energy gain of 1.32 mev compared to the corresponding sa solution ) .",
    "however , in the absence of pinning , the formation of the wm is accompanied by orientational degeneracy @xcite ( that is there is an infinite manifold of rotationally degenerate ss - uhf ground states ) .",
    "the formation of a fermionic molecule , associated with electron localization , in the ground - state of a qd under magnetic - field - free conditions does not have an analog within the framework of the traditional models of atomic structure .",
    "@xcite however , the physics underlying this phenomenon , which is a manifestation of sb resulting from strong electronic correlations ( see also section iv below ) , resembles closely that found in doubly - excited two - electron atoms . indeed , spectroscopical studies on doubly - excited helium atoms revealed rovibrational bands which were interpreted , borrowing from models developed in the context of nuclear and molecular physics , by invoking the formation of a `` triatomic '' molecule comprised of the two localized electrons and the he@xmath5 nucleus ( @xmath42 particle ) , with the collinear configuration being of particular significance .",
    "@xcite    the first electronically excited state of the @xmath0 tqd is the triplet @xmath43 state ( with the spins of the two electrons parallel to each other ) whose total electron density distribution [ fig .",
    "1(c ) , left ] resembles that of the ground - state singlet [ fig .",
    "1(b ) , left ] .",
    "however , the individual electronic wave functions in the @xmath43 state differ in character from those of the @xmath41 state [ compare right panels in fig .",
    "1(c ) and 1(b ) ] , with the lower - energy one being @xmath44-like ( but elliptically distorted ) , and the other is a @xmath45-like orbital oriented by the impurities along the @xmath46-axis .",
    "note that the @xmath43 state has the symmetry of the hamiltonian including the two pinning impurities ( that is , here the ss - uhf solution coincides with the symmetry - adapted one ) .",
    "the same orbital characters are obtained also in the absence of the pinning impurities , but without a preferred orientation .",
    "in this case , however , the character of the @xmath43 state is a result of spontaneous sb , with an energy gain of 0.09 mev compared to the corresponding sa ( circular ) solution .",
    "underlying the type of spontaneous sb in the ( open - shell ) @xmath43 state of the @xmath0 tqd is the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect @xcite where lowering of the total energy is achieved via mixing of the two - fold degenerate @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) amd @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) angular momentum states , concomitant with a deformation of the self - consistent potential away from circular symmetry .",
    "@xcite to distinguish such electron molecules from the wm discussed above for the closed - shell singlet state ( whose formation is driven by the dominance of the electron - electron repulsion ) , we refer to them as jt electron molecules ( jtem s ) .",
    "such spontaneous sb via jt distortions is familiar from studies of the rotational spectra of open - shell nuclei @xcite and from investigations of shape deformations of open - shell metal clusters .",
    "@xcite    similar calculations for the @xmath0 tqd , but with repulsive pinning impurities ( that is @xmath51 ) yield for the singlet ground state qualitatively similar results ( with different values for the energies ) , but with an important distinction that now the pinned orientation of the wm is rotated by @xmath52 compared to the @xmath38 case ( i.e. , the `` intramolecular '' axis of the wm is oriented normal to the interimpurity axis ) . consequently , through variation of the sign ( polarity ) of the impurity gate voltages , one may `` flip '' the orientation of the wm , and with it the direction of the polarization of the electronic charge distribution in the qd . in this way , the formation of wm s in qd s and the ability to control their discrete orientations via pinning voltage gates may serve as a method for the creation of on - off information storage cells and nanoscale logic gates . @xcite",
    "next , we examine the properties of a @xmath0 rutherford qd ( rqd ) , that is a @xmath0 qd with a central attractive impurity .",
    "the ss - uhf singlet and triplet electronic orbitals corresponding to a @xmath0 rqd for @xmath3 with a single impurity ( @xmath53 ) located at ( 0,0,10 ) nm are shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) respectively .",
    "they exhibit wm symmetry breaking and jt - distortion features similar to those found for the @xmath0 tqd [ compare fig .",
    "1(b and c ) ] , but with a reduced wm bond length and a more compact triplet .",
    "the `` strength '' of the sb depends of course on the impurity charge @xmath54 and/or its distance @xmath55 from the qd plane . for example , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( and for an arbitary position of the impurity inside the qd ) , no symmetry breaking was found by us due to the strong trapping by the impurity of the two electrons which occupy circularly symmetric orbitals , resembling the behavior of the ground - state of the natural he atom .",
    "@xcite we also remark that for the case described in fig .",
    "2(b ) and fig .",
    "2(c ) both electrons are slightly trapped by the impurity potential for the @xmath41 state , while for the @xmath43 state the @xmath44-like electron is strongly trapped and the @xmath45-like electron occupies a much less bound orbital .",
    "note that here , as with the case of a clean qd , the singlet wm and the jt - distorted triplet are free to rotate in the plane of the qd , since there are no off - centered pinning impurities .",
    "the large physical size of qd s makes them ideally suited for investigations of magnetic - field effects and controlled manipulations .",
    "to illustrate such effects , we display in fig .",
    "2(a ) the magnetic - field induced variation of the total energies of the @xmath41 and @xmath43 states in the @xmath0 rqd ( qualitatively similar behavior is found also for the @xmath0 tqd ) .",
    "as seen , the energy of the singlet state increases and that of the triplet state decreases with increasing @xmath31 ; for fields @xmath58 ( 0.2 t ) , the variation of the energy of the @xmath43 ( the slope of the curve ) is smaller than that for @xmath59 [ see inset in fig .",
    "furthermore , at a critical value @xmath60 t [ marked by a down - arrow in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , the energies of the two states cross and from then on the triplet lies below the singlet .",
    "for the singlet , the broken - symmetry wm state [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] maintains under the influence of the applied magnetic field in the range considered in fig .",
    "2(a ) , with the increase in the magnetic - field strength leading to further shrinkage of the bond length of the wm accompanied by an overall increase of the energy of the @xmath41 state @xcite [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] .",
    "the influence of the magnetic field on the triplet state is more subtle . as aforementioned , at @xmath3 the symmetry of the @xmath43 state is broken by the jt effect involving mixing of the @xmath61 degenerate angular momentum orbitals ( see ref .  ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic field lifts the degeneracy of these @xmath48 and @xmath50 states ( without mixing them ) , and this effect competes with the jt distortion . for small enough fields [ @xmath58 ,",
    "see inset in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , the jt effect prevails , and thus the orbitals and electron densities remain similar to those shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , and they maintain an orientational degeneracy in the plane .",
    "at stronger fields ( @xmath59 ) , the lifting of the energetic degeneracy of the @xmath48 and @xmath50 states overcomes the jt effect , and the second electron populates the lower of these two orbitals . as a result ,",
    "circular symmetry is recovered , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the overall decrease with @xmath31 of the energy of the @xmath43 state relative to the @xmath41 state is due to enhanced stabilization by the ( parallel - spin ) exchange energy in the former , reduced coulomb repulsion between the electrons occupying @xmath44- and @xmath45-like orbitals , and quenching of the kinetic energy of the @xmath45-like orbital by the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite this effect increases with @xmath31 , and at @xmath62 the @xmath43 state becomes the ground state [ see fig .",
    "note that this transition is driven primarily by the interelectron repulsion and not by the interaction of the electrons moments with the magnetic field ( see ref .   and references therein )",
    "; for our system , the zeeman splitting energy is 0.026 mev / t . at even larger fields , the coulomb repulsion between the electrons increases ( due to the shrinking of the orbitals ) resulting in an ascending trend of the energy of the @xmath43 state , which remains , however , lower than the singlet state .",
    "a similar scenario is found also for the tqd ( without pinning impurities ) .    in light of previous findings",
    "@xcite pertaining to formation of fully spin - polarized symmetry - broken states in clean qd s ( tqd s ) at high magnetic fields , it is pertinent to inquire whether the circular symmetry found for the @xmath43 state of the @xmath0 rqd for @xmath63 t will also be broken at higher fields .",
    "for the clean @xmath0 tqd , we verified that indeed an orientationally degenerate electron molecule [ with the molecular orbitals of the electrons distributed about the two molecular centers , see fig .",
    "2(e ) ] formed at sufficiently high @xmath31 ( e.g. , @xmath64 t ) .",
    "such an electron molecule is akin @xcite to the jtem discussed above in the context of the triplet state for @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , such reemergence of a jtem structure does not occur at these conditions for the @xmath0 rqd studied here due to the enhanced gap between the @xmath48 orbital and the strongly trapped @xmath44 orbital .",
    "this provides an additional venue for impurity - assisted manipulation and design of the electronic properties of qd s .",
    "as mentioned earlier , for @xmath13 , the ss - uhf approach applied to qd s yields _ approximate _ ground - state solutions which violate the symmetries of the original many - body hamiltonian , e.g , the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry discussed in sections ii and iii for a circularly symmetric clean qd ( i.e. , a tqd ) or one with a central impurity ( i.e. , rqd ) . at a first glance , this situation may appear puzzling , but it is not unique in the context of many - body theory of finite fermionic systems . indeed , a similar situation was encountered in nuclear physics in the 1950 s , when it was discovered that open shell nuclei carried permanent quadrupole moments and that many of them exhibited well developed rotational spectra ( i.e. , they behaved like rigid rotors ) .",
    "the explanation of these experimental findings was formulated in the framework of breaking of the rotational symmetry associated with nuclear deformations of the jahn - teller type , and it led to several celebrated models and semi - empirical methods , i.e. , the particle - plus - rotor model of bohr and mottelson , @xcite the modified - anisotropic - oscillator model of nilsson @xcite and the strutinsky shell - correction method .",
    "@xcite in the language used by us here , this means that at the microscopic level the breaking of the rotational symmetry had to be accounted @xcite for via space ( s)-uhf methods ( that is allowing the spatial - orbital solutions of the hartree - fock equations to assume symmetries lower than those of the underlying many - body hamiltonian ) .    starting with peierls and yoccoz @xcite ( see also peierls and thouless @xcite ) ,",
    "numerous theoretical investigationss have addressed the connection of the broken - symmetry hf solution to the exact solution , and led to the theory of _ restoration - of - symmetry _ via projection techniques .",
    "@xcite the central physical ingredient of the projection technique rests with the observation that a hf solution which breaks rotational symmetry is not unique , but belongs to an infinitely - degenerate manifold of states with different spatial orientation . a proper linear combination of the hf determinants in such a manifold yields multi - determinental states with good _ total _ angular momenta that are a better approximation to the exact solution . for a comprehensive review on restoration of symmetry in the context of nuclear many - body theory , we refer the reader to the book by ring and schuck mentioned in ref .",
    "( see also ref .",
    ", where the principles of restoration of rotational symmetry are discussed in the two - dimensional case )",
    ".    the restoration of symmetry via projection techniques in the case of ss - uhf solutions describing 2d - qd s will be presented in a future publication . in this section",
    ", we found it more convenient to discuss the connection between the ss - uhf and the exact solutions by taking advantage of the simplicity of solving the exact problem at @xmath3 for two electrons interacting via the coulomb force and confined by an external parabolic confinement without impurities ( clean qd ) .",
    "indeed , it is well known that in this case , the exact schrdinger equation for two interacting electrons is separable in the center - of - mass , @xmath65 ( with a corresponding mass @xmath66 ) , and relative , @xmath67 ( with a corresponding reduced mass @xmath68 ) , coordinates .    to analyze the properties of the exact solutions , two quantities @xcite have customarily been extracted from the two - body wave function @xmath69 [ where the tilde denotes both spatial and spin variables , i.e. , @xmath70 @xmath71 , see appendix b ] : ( i ) the usual pair - correlation function , @xcite @xmath72 and ( ii ) the electron density ( ed ) @xmath73    however , for the exact @xmath74 in the case of a circularly symmetric confinement , both of these quantities turn out to be also circularly symmetric and thus they do not reveal the full physical picture , the ( possible ) formation of an electron molecule generated by electron correlations .",
    "a more suitable quantity here is the conditional probability distribution ( cpd ) @xmath75 for finding one electron at @xmath76 given that the second electron is at @xmath77 .",
    "this quantity has been extensively used @xcite in the analysis of electron correlations in doubly - excited helium - like atoms , and is defined as follows , @xmath78 [ for details concerning the calculation of the quantities in eqs.([pair ] ) @xmath79 ( [ cpd ] ) , see appendix b ] .    in the left column of fig .  3",
    ", we display the above three quantities for the exact ground state in the case of a parabolic confinement with the same parameters as used throughout this paper ( see ref .  ) and @xmath3 . the pair - correlation function in fig .",
    "3(a ) exhibits a well developed depression at @xmath80 , namely the two electrons on the average keep apart from each other at a distance @xmath81 nm . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we plot the cpd with @xmath82 ( marked by a cross ) .",
    "it is seen that the maximum probability for finding the second electron occurs at the diametrically opposite point @xmath83 , in accordance with the picture of an electron molecule presented earlier within the ss - uhf approach . the exact electron density shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) is circularly symmetric , as expected .",
    "comparing figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) , the following interpretation ensues naturally , namely that the cpd in fig .",
    "3(b ) describes the electron molecule in its _ intrinsic ( body - fixed ) _ frame of reference , while the electron density in fig .",
    "3(c ) describes the electron molecule in the laboratory frame of reference where rotational and and center - of - mass displacements are superimposed upon the intrinsic probability density .",
    "3(d ) displays the electron density for the corresponding ss - uhf ground state .",
    "as discussed earlier , the ss - uhf electron density breaks the rotational symmetry and clearly exhibits the morphology of an electron molecule , unlike the exact one in fig .",
    "it is apparent that the ss - uhf electron density corresponds to that in the intrinsic frame of the electron molecule .",
    "restoration of the symmetry via projection techniques will bring the ss - uhf electron density closer to that of the exact solution .",
    "as aforementioned , this interpretation is familiar in the context of nuclear and it is further supported by the cpd calculated with the ss - uhf ground - state [ i.e. , by using @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ cpd ] ) , instead of the exact many - body @xmath74 , see appendix b ] and displayed in fig.3(e ) .",
    "although naturally not identical , the two cpd s ( i.e. , the exact and the uhf ) are of similar nature and both illustrate graphically the correlation effect associated with electron localization and formation of an electron molecule .",
    "we further illustrate this point by contrasting the exact and ss - uhf cpd s with the cpd of the symmetry - adapted rhf ground state , shown in fig .",
    "3(f ) . in this latter case , @xmath85 , with @xmath86 being the 1@xmath44 orbital of the rhf ;",
    "as a result , the probability of finding one electron at @xmath76 is independent of the position of the second electron and it is centered about the origin where it achieves its maximum value , as expected from an independent - particle description , i.e. , @xmath87    finally it is of interest to examine the energetic aspects of the symmetry breaking .",
    "indeed the energy of the ground - state is @xmath88 mev for the rhf solution , @xmath89 mev for the ss - uhf solution , and @xmath90 mev for the exact one .",
    "since the correlation energy is the difference between the rhf and the exact energies , @xcite one finds @xmath91 mev .",
    "thus the symmetry breaking associated with the ss - uhf solution is able to capture @xmath92 44% of the correlation energy ; the remaining amount can be captured through improvements via projection techniques .",
    "the dominance of interelectron interactions and correlations in quantum dots ( often referred to as `` artificial atoms '' ) results in spontaneous symmetry breaking of the self - consistent mean field , beyond the central - field picture on which the modern understanding of atomic structure has been founded . indeed , as shown in this paper through spin - and - space unrestricted hartree - fock @xcite many - body calculations for the singlet ground state of a 2e qd , such symmetry breaking and the resulting formation of wigner molecules do occur for a wide range of system parameters ( with or without impurities ) even in the most elementary case of two - electron qd s .",
    "additionally , in the case of fully polarized dots ( e.g. , the triplet state of a 2e qd ) , the ss - uhf calculations show that similar electron molecules form due to symmetry breaking associated with jahn - teller - type distortions .    in spite of the simplicity of the hamiltonian ,",
    "correlations in two - electron qd s underlie a remarkably rich and complex physical behavior . as a result",
    ", 2e qd s can serve as paradigms for a unification of concepts pertaining to spontaneous sb in various finite fermion aggregates , including nuclei , excited atoms , and clusters .",
    "furthermore , impurity and/or magnetic - field effects allow for controlled manipulation of the formation and pinning of the discrete orientations of the electron molecules in 2e qd s . such ability may be employed in future applications of qd s as nanoscale logic cells and information storage elements .",
    "impurity effects were also illustrated for the case of a quantum dot with more than two electrons .",
    "confirmation of the formation in 2e qd s of electron molecules associated with symmetry breaking of the self - consistent field ( in the context of ss - uhf calculations ) was obtained through an analysis of the exact ground state via the conditional - probability - distribution technique .",

    "in the main body of this paper we limited ourselves to the case of 2e qd s , since focusing on this elementary case allowed us to better elucidate the intricate physical principles involved in the formation and impurity control of electron molecules in qd s , from both the perspective of the ss - uhf treatment and the exact solution . in this appendix , we will present an example of the many different structural possibilities that can arise when impurities are introduced in a qd with a larger number of electrons . in particular , we consider a qd with 8 electrons in the presence of a hydrogenic - like @xmath93 impurity of variable nominal charge @xmath94 placed at the center ( and in one case off - center ) of the qd ( for the other input parameters , we use same values as used throughout the text , see ref .  ) .",

    "however , @xmath95 will be allowed to take both positive ( repulsive ) and negative ( attractive ) values .",
    "4(a ) displays the ss - uhf electron density for a repulsive central impurity [ located at ( 0,0,0 ) ] with @xmath96 .",
    "it is seen that a wigner molecule consisting of a single ring with 8 electrons [ denoted as a ( 0,8 ) ring ] is formed in this case . for a slightly attractive central impurity with @xmath97 , however , a structural change takes place , namely one electron moves to the center of the dot [ see fig .",
    "notice that this ( 1,7 ) structure agrees with the arrangement found in studies of classical point - charges in a purely @xmath98 harmonic confinement .",
    "@xcite increasing the attractive nominal charge to @xmath99 [ see fig .  4(c ) ] results in a further structural change , namely the central impurity is now able to trap two electrons , thus leading to a ( 2,6 ) arrangement",
    ". a further increase of the attractive charge of the impurity to the value @xmath100 does not produce any qualitative change in the ( 2,6 ) arrangement as long as the impurity remains at the center of the dot . by moving the impurity to an off - center position , however ,",
    "various structural morphologies can arise , an example of which is presented in fig .",
    "4(d ) for a @xmath100 impurity located at ( 20,0,0 ) nm , forming a highly distorted ( 2,6 ) wm ( here the first index denotes that two electrons are trapped by the impurity ) .",
    "a further increase in the attractive charge @xmath54 leads to sequential trapping of the remaining six electrons and to progressive elimination of symmetry breaking , until all eight electrons have been captured by the impurity ( see also section iii ) .",
    "in the case of two interacting electrons confined by a parabolic potential ( clean qd ) , one can perform a change of variables to center - of - mass ( cm ) , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and relative - motion ( rm ) , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , coordinates .",
    "then the two - electron hamiltonian separates into cm and rm contributions , @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 where @xmath66 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "the center - of - mass motion associated with the coordinate @xmath111 obeys a schrdinger equation describing the motion of a particle of mass @xmath66 in a 2d isotropic harmonic potential of frequency @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the frequency of the original parabolic confinement , i.e. , the interelectron repulsion has no baring on the center - of - mass motion .",
    "using dimensionless polar coordinates @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the center - of - mass wave function can be written as @xmath114 with the radial part given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 are the radial and azimuthal ( related to the angular momentum ) quantum numbers , respectively , @xmath117 , the normalization constant @xmath118^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath119 are associated laguerre polynomials .    since in the exact problem",
    "the coulomb interaction preserves the rotational symmetry , the radial part of the wave function @xmath120 associated with the relative motion obeys the following one - dimensional schrdinger equation [ in dimensionless polar coordinates @xmath121 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 the @xmath124 term results from the interelectron repulsion .    defining @xmath125 ( where @xmath126 is the spin of the @xmath127th electron and @xmath128 ) , the exact many - body ( here two - body ) wave function",
