    "the goal of nanoelectronics is to construct circuits at the molecular / atomic level @xcite . to this end ,",
    "one of the most important molecules is benzene , because of its structural simplicity and its appearance in larger compounds .",
    "consequently , a detailed understanding of its electron - transmission properties is central to delving further into those of more complicated structures . in particular ,",
    "when feasible , analytical solutions can be of considerable value . of many studies of benzene ,",
    "one recent one is that of hansen _ et al _ @xcite , who used the lwdin partitioning technique to derive the green s function , in analytical form , for an isolated benzene molecule .",
    "subsequently , the coupling of the molecule to the metallic leads was described using first - order perturbation theory .",
    "this allowed the transmission function @xmath0 to be calculated , with particular attention paid to the anti - resonances ( for which @xmath1 ) .",
    "even more recently , dias and peres @xcite used the green s function method , within the tight - binding approximation , to derive an analytical expression for the transmission function through a para - benzene ring , albeit in a non - simplified form .",
    "our own studies of benzene systems are based on applying the renormalization method @xcite to the tight - binding green s function formalism , which although equivalent to that of @xcite , has the advantage of circumventing the direct evaluation of certain integrals . as in @xcite , the transmission function",
    "is then evaluated via the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite .",
    "in addition to investigating transmission through a single benzene molecule @xcite , the method has also been used to study series and parallel circuits of such molecules @xcite , overlap effects @xcite , replacement of a carbon atom @xcite , and applied - field effects @xcite . in this paper , which can be viewed as a supplement to @xcite , we present the analytical forms of the transmission functions for a single benzene molecule , connected to carbon leads , in each of the para , meta and ortho configurations ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .        additionally , particular attention is paid to the key analytical features of each function , namely , anti - resonances ( which are the zeroes of @xmath2 ) , resonances ( for which @xmath3 ) , and other minimum and maximum values .",
    "these details can be of considerable value in analysing more complicated systems , based on benzene , but for which explicit analytical solutions are not feasible .",
    "our starting point is a brief summary of the relevant results from @xcite for transmission through a single benzene molecule ; for complete details , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the basic method therein was to use the lippmann - schwinger equation to derive the transmission probability for an electron through a one - dimensional tight - binding chain , containing a double impurity .",
    "subsequently , this allows benzene ( and indeed , a wide variety of systems ) to be studied , by using the renormalization technique to reduce the molecule to a dimer , with rescaled energy - dependent parameters , which then plays the role of the double impurity .",
    "the main mathematical result is that the transmission - energy probability function has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 and the reduced dimensionless energy is @xmath7 in the above , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the site and bond energies , respectively , for the carbon atoms in benzene and in the leads , while @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the rescaled parameters for the dimer . in general situations ,",
    "the dimer is asymmetric resulting in @xmath13 , but for the cases considered here , it turns out that the dimers are all symmetric , so that @xmath14 , and hence @xmath15 in ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "as derived in detail in equations ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) of @xcite , the rescaled dimer parameters for para - benzene are @xmath16 @xmath17 for convenience of presentation , we use parameter values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for which the energy band is the range @xmath20 . on substituting ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) , and using ( [ eq2 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] )",
    ", some lengthy algebraic manipulation leads to the comparatively simple expression for the transmission probability @xmath21 whose graph is shown in figure [ fig2 ] , and is clearly seen to be symmetric , in accord with @xmath0 being an even function .     versus energy @xmath22 for",
    "para - benzene.,width=453 ]    \\(a ) * anti - resonances *    anti - resonances are energies for which the transmission probability is 0 , so setting @xmath23 in ( [ eq7 ] ) yields only @xmath24 , and correspond to the band edges , which are not considered to be true anti - resonances .",
    "this is in accord with what is seen in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "\\(b ) * resonances *    resonances are energies for which the transmission probability is 1 , which from ( [ eq7 ] ) requires that @xmath25 which can be rearranged as @xmath26 from which it is clear that the only resonances occur at @xmath27 this pair of resonances is clearly visible on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "\\(c ) * extrema *    extreme values of @xmath0 include resonances and anti - resonances , as well as other maxima and minima .",
    "these are determined by setting @xmath28 , which produces @xmath29 whose solutions are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the first two critical points are obviously the resonances ( maxima ) mentioned above , while @xmath31 corresponds to a minimum value of @xmath32 , as can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] , and can be verified using the second - derivative test .",
    "thus we can confirm analytically all the key features of @xmath0 seen on its graph .",
    "it is important ( and reassuring ) to note that figure [ fig2 ] matches precisely the corresponding figure 6(a ) of dias and peres @xcite , which was produced using the same model and parameter values , but with somewhat different methodology .",
    "moreover , there is also agreement with the work of hansen _ et al _ @xcite , despite some differences in the models used .",
    "specifically , figure 4 of that paper indicates that the @xmath0 curve for para - benzene is without anti - resonances .      once again referring to @xcite ( equations ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) ) , the rescaled parameters for meta - benzene are @xmath33 @xmath34 substituting ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) , and using maple to perform the simplifications , leads to @xmath35 which is graphed in figure [ fig3 ] .     versus energy @xmath22 for meta - benzene.,width=453 ]",
    "although more complicated than that for para - benzene , the graph for meta - benzene is once again symmetric .",
    "\\(a ) * anti - resonances *    putting @xmath23 in ( [ eq14 ] ) sets its numerator to 0 , from which we obtain the band edges @xmath36 , as well as 3 anti - resonances @xmath37 which are clearly visible in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we note that these anti - resonances correspond precisely to those found for meta - benzene by hansen _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) * resonances *    to find resonances , we set @xmath38 in ( [ eq14 ] ) , i.e. , set the numerator equal to the denominator , which produces a degree-8 equation which surprisingly simplifies to just @xmath39 the only solutions of ( [ eq16 ] ) are the two resonances @xmath40 which can be seen in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "\\(c ) * extrema *    as usual , critical points are found by setting @xmath28 , which in application to ( [ eq14 ] ) leads , after much computer algebra , to the condition @xmath41 equation ( [ eq18 ] ) has a total of 9 distinct real solutions .",
    "easily seen are the anti - resonances @xmath42 and @xmath43 , from ( [ eq15 ] ) , which are obviously minima .",
    "also readily apparent are the two resonances , @xmath44 , encountered in ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "lastly , the pair of quadratic factors at the right end of ( [ eq18 ] ) admit 4 real roots , only 2 of which lie in the transmission band , namely @xmath45 the second - derivative test can confirm that the solutions ( [ eq19 ] ) are maxima , although not resonances , as they can be clearly seen on the graph of figure [ fig3 ] as the energies corresponding to the smaller inner pair of peaks .    in summary",
    ", we have been able to verify analytically all the major features of figure [ fig3 ] , and to reaffirm the relevant part of the work of hansen _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "( unfortunately , dias and peres @xcite only considered para - benzene . )",
    "lastly , we turn to ortho - benzene , for which the rescaled parameters are ( equations ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) of @xcite ) @xmath46 @xmath47^{-1}. \\label{eq21}\\ ] ] following our earlier strategy , we substitute ( [ eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) , then use maple to produce the transmission probability function @xmath48[4(2e-1)(2e+1)^2(e-1)^2 - 1 ] } } , \\label{eq22}\\ ] ] which is obviously a more complicated expression than those for the para and meta cases , and results in the more elaborate graph shown in figure [ fig4 ] .     versus energy @xmath22 for ortho - benzene.,width=453 ]    in accord with the two previous cases , the graph here is again symmetric .",
    "\\(a ) * anti - resonances *    the form of @xmath0 given in ( [ eq22 ] ) easily yields its zeroes , which are the band edges @xmath24 as well as 2 pairs of anti - resonances , specifically , @xmath49 which can be seen in figure [ fig4 ] . once again , these results agree with the work of hansen _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) * resonances *    setting @xmath38 leads to an 8th - degree equation , which can be shown to factorize as @xmath50 hence ( [ eq23a ] ) can be solved to show that it has no real solutions , so there are no resonances .",
    "this is in agreement with the graph .",
    "\\(c ) * extrema *    starting from @xmath0 in ( [ eq22 ] ) to set up the equation @xmath28 leads , after some computer algebra , to the factorized critical - point condition @xmath51 which certainly allows for a lot of solutions , not all of them real .",
    "first , the 4 anti - resonances ( [ eq23 ] ) can be recovered as the zeroes of the linear factors @xmath52 and the lead quadratic factor @xmath53 .",
    "next , the leading linear factor @xmath22 obviously yields a critical point at @xmath54 which can be seen on figure [ fig4 ] to correspond to the large maximum at the center of the graph . the second quadratic factor , @xmath55 , gives rise to a pair of solutions , namely , @xmath56 which can be seen on the graph to be the outer pair of maxima .",
    "the quartic factor has no real zeroes .",
    "finally , the sextic factor leads to only a pair of real zeroes , which are @xmath57^{1/2 }   = \\pm 0.609 , \\label{eq27}\\ ] ] corresponding on the graph to the smallest ( and inner ) pair of maxima .",
    "the set of 5 energies given by ( [ eq25])-([eq27 ] ) completes the group of maxima seen in figure [ fig4 ] , with none of them being resonances , as was pointed out earlier .    despite the complicated form of the @xmath0 function of ( [ eq22 ] )",
    ", we have , with the assistance of computer algebra , been able to extract all of its key features , seen in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "in this paper , we have followed up our previous work on transmission through benzene molecules , by deriving explicit analytic formulas for the transmission probability functions , for each of the three types of lead - connections .",
    "subsequently , this allowed us to determine analytically all the key features seen on the graphs of these functions , specifically , anti - resonances , resonances and other extrema . where possible , the work here was compared with that of other researchers and found to be in agreement .",
