    "alternative cosmological probes offer complementary and orthogonal avenues for answering pressing questions such as the nature of dark energy and the growth of large - scale structure ( for a recent review of traditional and alternative probes , see  @xcite ) .",
    "one such alternative probe is the  ( ap ) test  @xcite , which instead of using standard candles such as type ia supernovae  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or standard rulers such as baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ;",
    "@xcite ) relies on standard _ spheres _ for a geometrical test of cosmological parameters .",
    "the principal concept underlying the ap test is simple : in a properly chosen cosmology , spheres will maintain a uniform ratio of line - of - sight to angular extent .",
    "deviations from sphericity as a function of redshift thus reveal the true cosmology .",
    "since the ap test relies only on statistical isotropy , it has been considered for  and applied to  a variety of systems and features , such as the lyman-@xmath7 forest  @xcite , the power spectrum of the epoch of reionization  @xcite , galaxy cluster autocorrelation spectra  @xcite , galaxy clustering in the wigglez survey  @xcite , galaxy pairs  @xcite , and the bao feature in the sloan digital sky survey  @xcite .",
    "current successful applications of the ap test  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are limited to large scales , fundamentally limiting their constraining power . a promising way to apply the ap test to smaller scales ( thereby reducing statistical uncertainties ) while still avoiding large systematics",
    "is to use cosmic voids  @xcite , the large underdense regions in the cosmic web  @xcite .",
    "voids offer potentially revolutionary potential :  in terms of statistical power @xcite predicted that the ap test applied with voids in the upcoming euclid survey  @xcite will outperform bao in constraining dark energy equation of state parameters by up to a factor of ten .",
    "the power of voids comes from two aspects .",
    "first , their small size compared to the bao feature , down to @xmath05  @xmath8mpc  @xcite , gives them significant statistical weight .",
    "second , since their evolution is in the linear or quasi - linear regime , systematic effects due to peculiar velocities will be highly suppressed and easy to model out . even though the bao feature is more linear than void features , voids are a collective phenomenon defined by many galaxies and so void profiles ( and shapes ) are a cross - correlation  @xcite , whereas the bao relies on galaxy - galaxy auto - correlation . as we will see in this paper , the cross - correlation has potential to be less affected by peculiar velocities and other systematics than the auto - correlation .",
    "put simply , voids are simple objects .",
    "for example ,  @xcite discovered a single two - parameter density profile that describes voids of all sizes , and  @xcite applied this profile to reveal that voids in theory ( e.g. , in dark matter simulations ) obey self - similar scaling relations to voids in observations ( e.g. , in galaxy surveys ) .",
    "also , the merger tree analysis of  @xcite found that voids essentially do not move and do not merge over their lifetimes ; evolutionary dynamics do not overwhelm primordial cosmological information .",
    "even though current galaxy redshift surveys are not optimized for finding large numbers of voids ( due to their relative sparsity , low redshift , and complicated survey geometries ) , cosmological measurements with voids are still possible : for example , the largest publicly - available void catalog  @xcite has enabled observations such as the isw effect  @xcite and gravitational anti - lensing  @xcite .",
    "previously , we applied the ap test methodology described in  @xcite to voids found in the sdss dr7 main sample and lrg catalogs  @xcite , but due to the small number of voids found no statistically significant result  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the void ap analysis to higher redshifts and to more voids using the boss data release 10 lowz and cmass galaxy catalogs  @xcite .",
    "we also use mock catalogs tuned to our observational surveys to examine the systematic impact of peculiar velocities noted in the pure @xmath9-body simulations of  @xcite .",
    "we use these mocks to find an optimal binning strategy to increase sensitivity to our potential signal and then use the resulting size bins on the data .    in section  [ sec :",
    "samples ] we describe the galaxy samples and void catalogs to be used in the ap analysis .",
    "we discuss our method for measuring distortions in void shapes and the application to an ap test in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "section  [ sec : systematics ] focuses on systematics due to peculiar velocities , while section  [ sec : optimization ] features an analysis of our strategy for optimizing the signal given the limited number of voids in our current void catalog .",
    "we present our ap results in section  [ sec : results ] and offer prospectives on future work in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "for each galaxy we transform its sky latitude @xmath10 , sky longitude @xmath11 , and redshift @xmath12 into a comoving coordinate system : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the comoving distance to the galaxy at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "we assume cosmological parameters consistent with a @xmath5cdm  cosmology as given by the wmap 7-year results  @xcite : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we make no corrections for peculiar velocities .",
    "we construct volume - limited galaxy populations by making cuts in magnitude and redshift from the sdss data release 7 main sample  @xcite and sdss - iii boss data release 10  @xcite lowz and cmass galaxy catalogs .",
    "we make these cuts after applying evolution and @xmath18-corrections and computing absolute magnitudes using the above wmap 7-year cosmological parameters .",
    "the main sample cuts are described more fully in  @xcite , and we split the lowz catalog into four samples starting at @xmath19 and the cmass catalog into two samples starting at @xmath20 . to avoid overlap with the dr7 samples we ignore the first lowest - redshift lowz sample .",
    "our void - finding procedure as applied to observational data is described in detail in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "briefly , we use a heavily modified version of zobov  @xcite , which we call vide , for void identification and examination .",
    "this approach uses a voronoi tessellation to construct a density field from the galaxy population .",
    "our construction of volume - limited samples ensures that we have uniform density across the void surface so that we do not need to include any weighting in the tessellation step .",
    "this density field has topological features such as basins and ridgelines , and vide assembles adjacent basins into voids using a watershed algorithm . thus a void is simply an arbitrarily - shaped depression in the density field bounded by high - density ridgelines .",
    "vide does not apply any additional smoothing before the watershed step .",
    "in addition to the above references , we will discuss vide in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "a void can have any mean and minimum density , since the watershed algorithm includes as member particles galaxies in the surrounding high - density walls .",
    "however , we place a restriction such that the _ walls _ between adjacent basins can not be merged into a larger void unless the density of that wall is less than @xmath21 .",
    "this prevents the growth of voids deeply into clusters  @xcite .",
    "also , we remove voids with central densities greater than @xmath21 , measured within @xmath22 of the effective void radius .",
    "this cleaning aids in the shape measurement below .",
    "we only include voids with effective radii greater than the mean galaxy separation .    throughout this work we will refer to the void radius .",
    "we define the effective radius to be the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the void , where the void volume is the sum of all the voronoi cell volumes that comprise the void .    to accommodate the survey boundaries and masks we place a large number of mock particles along any identified edge .",
    "these mock particles have essentially infinite density and thus prevent the watershed from growing voids outside the survey area . after finding voids",
    "we take the _ central _ selection , where voids are guaranteed to sit well away from any survey boundaries or internal holes : the maximum distance from the void center to any member particle is less than the distance to the nearest boundary . as discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite , this ensures a fair distribution of void shapes and alignments .",
    "the voids identified with this approach in the dr7 main sample are already publicly available .",
    "table  [ tab : samples ] summarizes the names of our volume - limited samples , the maximum absolute magnitude , redshift bounds , mean galaxy number density , and the total number of voids identified in those samples .",

    "as we stack , we align the voids so that they share a common line of sight .",
    "this same approach has been used to construct real - space density profiles using projections  @xcite .",
    "we do not apply any rescalings to the void sizes as we stack .",

    "we placed our galaxy samples into a comoving coordinate system assuming a @xmath5cdm  cosmology .",

    "we take all galaxies within a radius cutoff of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the maximum void size in the stack .",
    "we project these galaxies onto a two - dimensional plane , @xmath47 where @xmath48 are the galaxy coordinates relative to the void barycenter @xmath49 : @xmath50 we then transform the line - of - sight coordinate @xmath51 by a factor @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) until the ellipticity measured within a sphere of radius @xmath54 is unity . in testing",
    "we found this radius to provide the best balance between gathering as many galaxies as possible for high signal - to - noise while avoiding fluctuations outside the void proper .",
    "we will validate this approach in the section below .",
    "we calculate the ellipticity @xmath55 via the inertia tensor : @xmath56 where the sums are taken over all galaxies within @xmath54 .",
    "we identify the necessary rescaling factor @xmath52 as the void stretch which enters into the ap measurement above . to estimate our uncertainty for each stack",
    "we repeat the above process for 1,000 bootstrap samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : stack ] shows an example void stack taken from the cmass sample and the measured stretch using this approach .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the ap effect with voids discussed in  @xcite revealed the presence of systematic effects due to peculiar velocities : a uniform compression along the line of sight for voids at all redshifts . in order to recover the expected ap signal , a single correction factor of @xmath57 ( with an observed flattening of 14% ,",
    "the correction factor is @xmath58 ) had to be applied .",
    "however , that analysis focused on a relatively thin stack of voids ( @xmath59  @xmath8mpc ) in a dark matter simulation .",
    "we extend this work to examine the impacts of peculiar velocities on more realistic galaxy populations .",
    "for our study we take the publicly - available void population presented in  @xcite ; namely , the _ halos dense _ and _ halos sparse _ samples .",
    "these two void samples are drawn from @xmath9-body simulation halo catalogs with similar number densities ( and , by construction , clustering properties ) of a high - density galaxy survey such as the dr7 main sample and a low - density survey such as dr10 cmass , respectively .",
    "note that we do not take the void catalogs drawn from an halo occupation distribution ( hod ;  @xcite ) galaxy population due to the ambiguity in applying hod modeling at higher redshifts .",
    "however , as  @xcite noted , the void populations between halos and galaxies are almost indistinguishable for these kinds of analysis , and thus the halos provide a good proxy for the galaxy populations .",
    "the particle positions were perturbed according to their peculiar velocities before finding voids .",
    "we analyze three simulation snapshots at redshifts @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , and subdivide each snapshot into four slices in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "these slices each have a comoving width of @xmath63  @xmath8mpc , or @xmath64 . in total",
    "there are @xmath65 voids in the _ halos dense _ catalogs and @xmath66 in the _ halos sparse _ catalogs . for the _ halos dense _ catalogs , we construct stacks of width @xmath67  @xmath8mpc",
    ". the fewer number of voids in the _ halos sparse _ catalogs necessitates the use of wider stacks with @xmath68  @xmath8mpc .",
    "we start adding voids to stacks beginning with voids with effective radii equal to the mean particle separation . with these stacks we applied the above ap analysis assuming the @xmath12-direction to be the line of sight .",
    "figure  [ fig : mocks_hubble ] shows the measured stretch as a function of redshift , @xmath38 , for these mock setups .",
    "since the voids are drawn from an @xmath9-body simulation with  @xmath5cdm  parameters , and we are assuming the same parameters for the ap test , we expect no stretch .",
    "instead , we see the same uniform 14% line - of - sight flattening , and hence a necessary @xmath38 correction factor of @xmath57 , as in  @xcite .",
    "we indicate this in the figure with a horizontal grey dashed line .",
    "we find , but do not show , the expected value of @xmath69 when repeating this analysis on voids without including peculiar velocities .",
    "we see that the systematic flattening due to peculiar velocities first observed by  @xcite persists for voids in mock galaxy populations , and also persists for all void sizes at all redshifts .",
    "there is some indication of a slight deviation for the highest redshifts in the _ halos sparse _ voids , but this is outside the redshift range that we consider in data .",
    "these results are not necessarily surprising : the recent works of  @xcite and  @xcite have shown that a single universal density profile applies to voids in all tracer populations and enables the definition of a scaling relationship among them .",
    "thus it is plausible that systematic effects that impact voids in simulation will be similar in real galaxy populations .",
    "we leave a detailed study of the cause of this systematic offset to future work : a better understanding of this effect can be reached by directly comparing on a one - to - one basis voids in mocks with and without peculiar velocities included ( similar to the approach taken in  @xcite to examine the impacts of galaxy sparsity and bias ) .",
    "a preliminary study shows that peculiar velocities impart a uniform flattening to void shapes along the line of sight .",
    "while one might expect peculiar velocities to elongate individual voids  @xcite , the situation is less clear in a statistical sample of the full cosmic web : the elongation in the dynamically outflowing portion of voids competes with a thickening of the walls separating them .",
    "in addition , peculiar velocities will have an effect on the assignment of a given portion of survey volume to individual voids .",
    "we may use the measured flattening as a metric for optimization : we wish to have as many independent stacks as possible , but too few voids  and hence tracers  in a stack will degrade the shape measurement , leading to @xmath70 even in the presence of peculiar velocities .",
    "this occurs because poisson fluctuations overwhelm the shape distortions caused by  stretching and peculiar velocities .",
    "we investigated the minimum number of voids required , the minimum and maximum stack width , the minimum void size to start stacking , the radius at which the ellipticity is calculated , whether to use all particles in the stack or only particles that are members of a vide void , and whether to rescale voids to the same radius or not .",
    "first , we found that rescaling voids severely degrades the measurement due to the broadening of the high - density wall ( for example , see the density profiles in  @xcite ) .",
    "this broadening occurs because galaxies are moved to larger radii , leaving fewer galaxies within the void to use for the shape measurement and thereby increasing the poisson noise . also , we are able to reliably measure shapes when restricting ourselves to void - galaxies only , but the minimum number of voids in a stack is necessarily larger , since in this case we are making measurements with fewer numbers of particles per void .",
    "we found the radius choice of @xmath54 to be the most robust : at smaller radii we lose too many galaxies , and larger radii include fluctuations outside the void wall in the shape estimation , leading to highly variable measurements from stack to stack .",
    "when making broad stacks , as we will see below , we found that this criterion still succeeds even when some voids are smaller than @xmath54 of the stack .",
    "figure  [ fig : stack ] shows why this works : in a stacked void without rescaling , small voids contribute to the inner portions of the wall , while larger voids add galaxies to the outer edges .",
    "combined they give a very broad , smooth feature that robustly measures the overall shape .",
    "we found for both catalogs that we may begin stacking at the minimum void size provided by vide , which is the mean particle separation .",
    "we are able to recover reliable stretch measurements when setting larger thresholds for the minimum void size , but with larger statistical uncertainties .",
    "including all voids down to the mean particle separation did not introduce any systematic error .",
    "for the _ halos dense _ voids we require at least @xmath050 voids per stack to preserve the shape information , while for the _ halos sparse _ voids we must use at least @xmath0150 voids per stack .",
    "relatedly , the minimum stack width for reliable measurements in _ halos dense _ was @xmath05  @xmath8mpc , while in _ halos sparse _",
    "was @xmath020  @xmath8mpc .",
    "we found maximum reliable stack widths of @xmath020  @xmath8mpc  and @xmath040  @xmath8mpc  for the _ halos dense _ and _ halos sparse _",
    "mocks , respectively .",
    "the measurement degrades for very wide stacks because we increase the radius at which we compute ellipticities while adding relatively few new voids to the stack .",
    "in addition to the method of general measurement of ellipticity in the stack , we repeated the above analysis for the mcmc shape - fitting algorithm presented in  @xcite and applied to data in  @xcite , using both a cubic density profile and the universal density profile of  @xcite . with both profiles we are able to reproduce these ap measurements , but we require a factor of @xmath02 greater number of voids per stack to avoid catastrophic failures of the estimator .",
    "also , voids rescaling is required for the profile - fitting method to avoid being dominated by large fluctuations inside the void wall , and rescaling can only be reliably applied for relatively narrow radius bins , as seen above .",
    "while the methods based on profile fitting achieve much tighter constraints once the number of voids is above this threshold , we find ellipticity - based methods such as the one described in section  [ sec : method ] more robust ( i.e. , less subject to poisson noise ) for the number of voids available in the extant sample .",
    "also , with relatively few voids available in data we are forced to use wide radial bins , where the profile - fitting method is less robust .",
    "we will comment in the conclusions on the comparison of our results and the forecasts of the ap measurement based on profile - fitting shape measurements .",
    "finally , we also repeated this analysis in redshift space using the coordinate system of  @xcite and  @xcite and found identical results .",
    "from the above optimization analysis , we selected the stacks listed in table  [ tab : stacks ] .",
    "this table lists the sample name , the void size range in the stack , and the number of voids in the stack . within each sample we attempted to create as many stacks as possible",
    "given the minimum required number of voids in order to correctly estimate the expected stretch in the mocks .",
    "we used the _ halos dense _ mock as a guide for the dr7 main sample , and the _ halos sparse _ mock for guidance with the dr10 lowz and cmass samples .",
    "we discard the _ dr72dim1 _ and _ dr10lowz4 _ samples due to a lack of a sufficient number of voids .",
    "we have verified in mocks that our chosen bin sizes and typical number of voids per stack are able to capture the correct ap measurement ( indeed , the stacks used in figure  [ fig : mocks_hubble ] are capped to 50 and 200 voids for the _ halos dense _ and _ halos sparse _ samples , respectively ) .",

    "we see that after this correction is applied our measurements scatter around the expected value of @xmath73 .",
    "these error bars are larger than the mean measurements shown in figure  [ fig : mocks_hubble ] , since in mocks we have many more individual stacks so that the mean measurement has relatively smaller uncertainty . with our limited number of voids in data",
    "we have , at best , two stacks per sample .",
    "note that if our shape measurements were degraded due to an insufficient number of voids in each stack , we would have measured a signal consistent with @xmath73 _ before _ correcting for peculiar velocities , and @xmath74 after corrections , since our measurement will be dominated by poisson noise , as discussed above .",
    "for example , the _ dr10lowz2 _ sample has the fewest number of voids for the given sparsity and is the most discrepant from the expected measurement .",
    "this serves as a useful null test . to evaluate the significance of our results compared to such a null measurement",

    "the likelihood ratio measures the amount by which our data prefer @xmath5cdm  to a null measurement .",
    "this significance test assumes gaussian uncertainties , which is a good approximation to the distribution of our bootstrap samples .",

    "we find @xmath78 , which while not a very strong rejection of null due to the large error bars , does provide `` substantial '' evidence , as usually interpreted in the bayesian literature  @xcite .",
    "we do not convert this likelihood ratio into a significance since that would require additional modeling of the posterior shape .",
    "our individual @xmath77 measures are less than one , since our error bar estimates should be seen as conservative .",

    "we calculate this likelihood using the weighted average measurements in each redshift bin after correcting for the effects of peculiar velocities .",
    "while our error bars do not allow a precise measurement of @xmath79 , we can read off likelihood ratios for various cosmologies .",
    "most significantly , we disfavor an @xmath3 universe by a factor of @xmath010 , which corresponds to substantial evidence for the ap effect expected in the lcdm model .",
    "we have used @xmath01,500 voids identified with the watershed transform code vide in the sdss dr7 main sample and boss dr10 lowz and cmass samples to perform an  test .",
    "we stacked voids to construct standard spheres and measured the ratio of their line - of - sight to angular extents , or _",
    "stretch_. we used voids found in mock populations with realistic number densities and clustering properties to assess the impact of peculiar velocities and optimize the stacking to produce the most significant result . after correcting for systematic effects and measuring the void stretch from redshift @xmath60 to @xmath1 we translated our  estimation into a constraint on @xmath79 .",
    "we find a best fit value of @xmath80 , and our measurements prefer this value over @xmath3 by a factor of 10 .",
    "we find a likelihood ratio of 4.5 for our results to reject a null measurement .",
    "taken together , we interpret these as a substantial detection of the  test with our sample of cosmic voids .",
    "we have verified the uniform and constant systematic offset caused by peculiar velocities originally seen in the pure @xmath9-body simulations of  @xcite to also apply to realistic galaxy populations .",
    "this 14% line - of - sight flattening appears universal for all void sizes studied ( 7 - 80  @xmath8mpc ) , all redshifts studied ( @xmath81-@xmath82 ) , and all tracer densities studied ( @xmath83 - @xmath84 particles per cubic  @xmath8mpc ) .",
    "we observe this flattening regardless of the composition of the void stack , once a minimum threshold number of voids is met . indeed , the ap measurement is quite binary : either no signal is obtained at all ( if there are too few voids ) or the measured signal has the expected uniform distortion . while we have some preliminary indication as to the source of this offset , we relegate a full analysis of the effects of peculiar velocities on voids found using vide to a forthcoming paper .",
    "we used our mocks to find the minimum number of voids necessary in a stack to obtain a measurement and used these results to optimize our result in data .",
    "we did not perform an exhaustive search through the space of _ all _ possible configurations ( e.g. , optimal number of redshift bins , volume - weighted samples , stacking configurations , etc . ) which leaves open the possibility of a substantial improved measurement with current data .",
    "our previous application of the ap test to cosmic voids  @xcite did not correct for systematic effects but did marginalize over potential bias values in the final likelihood analysis , which explains the very large uncertainty and preference for higher @xmath79 in that analysis .",
    "based on dark matter simulations  @xcite predicted that in the full boss survey an ap analysis with voids would be competitive with bao measurements from the same survey set . at this stage",
    "our bayes factor of 4.5 presents substantial but not yet strong or decisive evidence for the ap effect in the current boss void sample .",
    "several factors contribute to this difference .",
    "first , we do not yet have access to the full boss survey , which will include more galaxies within the same survey footprint , increasing the number density and hence accessing a much larger number of small voids .",
    "second ,  @xcite provided forecasts using a profile - based shape measurement technique .",
    "we found that this method results in far better ellipticity measurements but only when the number of voids in a stack exceeds a threshold of @xmath0100 for dense surveys and @xmath0300 for sparse surveys within relatively narrow radius bins  otherwise the fit fails catastrophically with high probability .",
    "the redshift width of our volume - limited samples prevents us from forming stacks of the required number of voids .",
    "finally , the earlier study used extrapolated abundances from voids found in the dark matter particle distribution rather than the more realistic simulations of voids found using dark matter halos or hod galaxies as tracers  ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis of the ap test in void catalogs drawn from realistic mocks shows that the data quality is about to cross a threshold where the ap test based on stacked voids will yield competitive and complementary measurements to those based on bao .",

    "the boss survey itself will provide more voids with upcoming data releases , and future spectroscopic surveys such as wfirst  @xcite , euclid  @xcite , or the square kilometer array  @xcite will dramatically increase the number of known voids from thousands to millions , allowing this analysis to move from detection of the effects to precision constraints and measurements of fundamental cosmological parameters .",
