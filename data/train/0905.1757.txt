    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red - dwarf secondary transferring matter via the roche - lobe overflow .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae , a subclass of dne , show superhumps during their long , bright outbursts ( superoutbursts ) [ see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the origin of superhumps is basically understood as a result of varying tidal dissipation in an eccentric accretion disk , whose eccentricity is excited by the 3:1 orbital resonance ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    until the mid-1990 s , the period of superhumps ( @xmath0 ) had been considered to decrease during superoutburst ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which was explained as a result of decreasing radius of the accretion disk during superoutburst @xcite . in recent years , the existence of objects with positive period derivatives ( @xmath1 ) of superhumps , particularly among systems with short orbital periods ( @xmath2 ) has been established ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since the superhump period , or its variation , is related to the radius of the accretion disk , or propagation of the eccentricity wave ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the period variation is expected to provide diagnostics of the dynamics in the outbursting accretion disk .",
    "a number of pieces of research have been issued in this perspective ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite reported markedly different @xmath3 s between different superoutbursts of tv crv .",
    "@xcite proposed an interpretation that this difference is caused by the different mass ( angular momentum ) in the accretion disk at the onset of the superoutburst , following the theory by @xcite .",
    "if this is confirmed , @xmath3 is expected to provide an observational measure of the mass in the disk .",
    "more recently , long - lasting superhumps with period unexpectedly ( @xmath40.5 % ) longer than superhump periods during the slowly fading stage of wz sge - type superoutbursts have been established @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that they are superhumps arising from the disk matter outside the 3:1 resonance , or around the tidal truncation .",
    "@xcite also proposed the transient 2:1 resonance in the outer disk could regulate the excitation and propagation of the 3:1 resonance , leading to a novel interpretation of the variety of @xmath3 in different su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "motivated by these suggestions , we present a new systematic survey of @xmath3 in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the lack of published times of maxima in some of references having been one of the major obstacles in the research of period variations of superhumps , we present times of all measured superhumps for potential future analysis .    in section [ sec : obs ] , we describe our observation and method of analysis . in section [ sec : general ] , we describe general properties of period variation in superhumps .",
    "general discussions are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section [ sec : wzsgestars ] is dedicated to wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "these sections are placed before section [ sec : individual ] ( individual objects ) because of the large amount of data presented in section [ sec : individual ] .",
    "we finally give section [ sec : conclusion ] for a summary of new findings .",
    "the names of the objects are sometimes abbreviated in tables , figures and sections [ sec : general ] and [ sec : discussion ] ; for original names of these objects , refer to section [ sec : individual ] .",
    "alternative designations were sometimes used when the original names were difficult to abbreviate properly .",
    "the data were obtained under campaigns led by the vsnet collaboration @xcite . in some objects , we used archival data for published papers , and the public data from the aavso international databasehttp://www.aavso.org / data / download/@xmath5 .",
    "] as a supplementary purpose .",
    "the majority of the data were acquired by time - resolved ccd photometry of with 30 cm - class telescopes , whose observational details on individual objects will be presented in separate papers dealing with in - depth analysis and discussion on individual objects . was less than @xmath6 .",
    "] we generally restricted our analysis to superoutburst plateau and rapid fading stage .",
    "in a few very well - observed cases , we dealt with post - superoutburst evolution of superhumps .",
    "after correction for systematic differences between observers , and subtracting the general trend by fitting low - order ( typically three to five ) polynomials , we extracted times of superhump maxima by numerically fitting a template superhump light curve around the times of observed maxima .",
    "we did not use the full superhump cycle but generally used phases @xmath70.4 to 0.4 in order to minimize the contamination from potentially present secondary maxima .",
    "we employed a phase - averaged ( and spline interpolated ) light curve of superhumps of gw lib as the template , which is one of the best - sampled object among all su uma - type dwarf novae ( figure [ fig : gwsh ] ) .",
    "( 88mm,70mm)fig1.eps    this usage of a fixed template has an advantage of much higher signal - to - noise and thereby higher precision in determining maxima than eye estimates ( typically reducing the scatter by a factor of @xmath4 5 ) or than fitting using lower - quality template light curves prepared for individual objects .",
    "the usage of a fixed template , however , has a potential disadvantage of systematic errors caused by the variation in the superhump profile and the difference of the profile from the template .",
    "these potential effects have been examined by comparisons between previously reported times of maxima ( referring to the same data ) and those determined in the present work .",
    "no significant systematic differences were found to affect the determination of @xmath3 . in some cases , comparisons with",
    "other authors have yielded significant constant offsets ( individually described in section [ sec : individual ] ) , presumably caused by different methods in extracting maxima .",
    "these offsets were also found to be insensitive to determining @xmath3 after adjustment by constant offsets .",
    "we generally used phase dispersion minimization ( pdm , @xcite ) for determining mean superhump periods described in the text .",
    "the values determined using linear regressions to times of superhump maxima can be slightly different from those determined with the pdm .",
    "when segments ( in @xmath8 ) are shown , these periods were derived from a linear regression of maxima times of superhumps unless otherwise noticed .",
    "since we mainly focus on period variations of superhumps , we only present superhump maxima and mostly omit individual light curves of outbursts , light curves of superhumps and results of pdm analysis to save space in section [ sec : individual ] .",
    "individual @xmath9 diagrams are not usually shown for the same reason ; selected examples of @xmath9 diagrams are summarized in section [ sec : general ] . we , however , tried to include a comparison of @xmath9 diagrams if different superoutbursts of the same object were observed , and tried to include the result of period analysis and the superhump profile if they provide the first solid presentation . in section",
    "[ sec : individual ] , we also included selected observations of several superoutbursts not sufficiently covered to determine @xmath3 , if the determination of @xmath0 is meaningful in itself or if the inclusion improves the statistical quality .",
    "we also included partially observed superoutbursts for completeness , and this inclusion for future research is justified by a suggestion that @xmath3 can be measured from a combination of different superoutbursts ( subsection [ sec : different ] ) .",
    "we also calculated superhump periods and derivatives when times of superhump maxima were available in the literature .",
    "we employed the same procedure as in the analysis of our own data .",
    "this work comprises the largest homogeneous survey of variation of superhumps in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
