    "a spin foam is a history , in the sense of a feynman path integral , of spin networks ( see @xcite p. 325 ) .",
    "a spin foam is a triple @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a two - dimensional complex , @xmath4 are the irreducible representations of a group g associated with each face @xmath5 of @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is an inter - twiner , which , at each edge @xmath7 of @xmath3 , maps the irreducible representations of @xmath8 associated with the incoming @xmath9-faces at the edge @xmath7 to the outcoming @xmath8-irreducible representations .",
    "we will restrict to the case @xmath10 .",
    "rovelli claims @xcite p. 328",
    ", based on the analysis of many spin foam models , that the general form of the partition function for discrete quantum gravity should have the form    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is a weight associated with each @xmath9-complex @xmath3 , @xmath13 is a coefficient associated with each face @xmath5 , and similarly @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coefficients associated with edge @xmath7 and vertex @xmath16 respectively .",
    "there are still two unsettled problems in spin foam formalism : coupling with fermionic matter , and how spin foam models are related to general relativity ( i.e. , the problem of the classical limit ) .",
    "a way of coupling with fermionic matter , based on local regge calculus , has been addressed in @xcite .",
    "+ we review recent results in local regge calculus in section 2 and 3 stressing some similarities between local regge calculus and spin foam formalism .",
    "section 4 contains new results .",
    "an important result in regge calculus from j.cheeger , w. muller , r. schrader in @xcite is that the einstein - regge action converges to the einstein - hilbert ( for a review of regge calculus see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that the convergence of the action is in _ sense of measure_. this applies when , roughly speaking , we choose a manifold and consider an approximation of it through a triangulation ( for example a sphere may be approximated by a triangulation inscribed in it ) .",
    "the number of hinges in the simplicial manifold increases along with the number of the simplices incident at each hinge .",
    "the difference , in modulus , between the einstein - hilbert action as functional on the manifold and the regge - einstein action as functional evaluated on the triangulations of the same manifold , become smaller and smaller as the triangulations will be finer and finer . + a different approach , with respect to the above regge calculus , has been proposed in @xcite with a first order formulation , in the sense of palatini , in @xcite . the main difference , with respect to the above regge calculus ,",
    "consists in introducing a reference frame in each @xmath17-dimensional simplex .",
    "an @xmath18 connection matrix @xmath19 is determined by two @xmath17-dimensional simplexes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which share a common ( @xmath22)-dimensional face @xmath23 .",
    "this matrix allows the passage from the reference frame @xmath20 to the reference frame @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the normal vector to the common face @xmath23 in the reference frame in @xmath20 .",
    "it behaves as _ n - bein _ in general relativity @xcite .",
    "its modulo is proportional to the volume of the face itself .",
    "let @xmath25 be the same normal vector in the reference frame in @xmath21 .",
    "these vectors are related by    @xmath26    ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . in the second order formalism",
    "@xcite @xcite , the n - bein and the @xmath18 connection matrices are functions of the vertex - coordinates in the reference frame of each simplex @xmath20 . a regge - einstein like action",
    "is defined .",
    "once one translates the formalism back into the original regge variables , the action appears to depend on @xmath27 instead of @xmath28 .",
    "this is generally considered a lattice artifact @xcite and is not a problem for convergence to the continuum theory , since @xcite that convergence regime occurs when @xmath28 is small , so that @xmath29 .",
    "the whole theory can be considered defined on the dual - metric voronoi - complex of the original simplicial complex . in that dual",
    "complex , the @xmath17-simplexes become points , the ( @xmath22)- faces dual links , and the @xmath30-hinges become two - dimesional plaquettes @xcite @xcite . labeling the vertices of the dual plaquette @xmath1 @xmath31 , as in lattice gauge theory , the holonomy around the plaquette is defined as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 are the matrices associated , respectively , with the links @xmath34 of the plaquette @xmath1 .",
    "the bivector @xcite @xcite , in the reference frame @xmath20 , whose modulus is equal to the volume of the @xmath30-dimensional hinge , is defined as    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the volume of the @xmath17-dimensional simplex .",
    "however , this is still a second - order formalism of discrete general relativity .",
    "now we introduce a first - order formalism in which @xmath19 and @xmath24 are independent variables",
    ". then equation ( [ relatto ] ) becomes a constraint    there is a further constraint on the @xmath24 , since the @xmath37 normals to the ( @xmath22)-dimensional faces of a @xmath17-simplex @xmath20 are linearly dependent ,    @xmath38    in order to define a gravitational action independent of the starting simplex reference frame , we need to define the following antisymmetric tensor on the plaquette @xmath1",
    "@xmath39    the action then is    @xmath40    the action ( [ caction ] ) coincides with the action in the second - order formalism @xcite @xcite . from this point on , we shall focus mainly on the four dimensional case .",
    "the action ( [ caction ] ) is invariant under the @xmath41 group , which is the gauge group .",
    "it has been shown that the discrete equations of motion for this theory can be derived , @xcite @xcite , and appear very similar to the general relativity equations in the covariant tetrad formalism @xcite . in the limit of _ small deficit angles _ , the _ levi - civita - regge _",
    "connection @xcite is , locally , the unique solution .",
    "clearly this is in total correspondence with the palatini continuum theory in general relativity where , in the torsion - free case , the levi - civita connection is solution of the field equations for the connection .",
    "this first order regge calculus is particularly well suited for coupling between gravity and fermionic matter .",
    "as has been pointed out in @xcite , a dirac spinor @xmath42 can be defined at each vertex @xmath20 of the dual - voronoi complex .",
    "a two - fold covering matrix group @xmath43 of @xmath41 replaces the connection matrices @xmath19 .",
    "the total action is the sum of the regge - einstein action and discrete dirac action .",
    "in the following we will use the notation : @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for the haar measure on @xmath41 . taking into account all the constraints that this theory carries @xcite , the path integral associated with the local regge - einstein equation ( [ caction ] ) of the previous section , is @xmath46    some observations from group theory ( see @xcite for all details ) suggest the expansion of the exponential of the action in characters @xmath47 of the irreducible representations @xmath48 of the group @xmath41 , as in lattice gauge theory .",
    "we can omit the index @xmath49 in the holonomy matrix @xmath50 , since it does not depend on the starting simplex @xmath20 @xcite ,    @xmath51    where the coefficients @xmath52 are defined by    @xmath53    therefore the partition function for discrete quantum gravity becomes    @xmath54    the equations above highlight the fact that each two - dimensional plaquette is associated with irreducible representations @xmath48 of @xmath41 .",
    "this association is not unique , as is clear from the coefficients of the characters @xmath47 expansion in ( [ svilup ] ) , there is a numerable set of @xmath41 irreducible representations @xmath48 associated with each plaquette @xmath1 .",
    "a further step is needed so that an irreducible representation @xmath55 of @xmath41 will be uniquely associated with the plaquette @xmath1 , as in spin foam formalism .",
    "the partition function ( [ color ] ) resembles a spin foam partition function with respect to the products on the plaquettes , the links , and the vertices ( see eq .",
    "[ foam ] sec.1 ) .",
    "barrett and crane @xcite propose a model for deriving spin networks by considering the double covering of @xmath41 , @xmath56 . in this approach ,",
    "relativistic quantum spins of @xmath56 are associated with the two - dimensional hinges of the simplicial complex .",
    "we apply these ideas to local regge calculus in order to find new results .",
    "the self - dual and anti - self - dual parts of each bi - vector ( eq . [ arrota ] , sec .",
    "2 ) form a representation of the @xmath56 lie algebra @xmath57 @xcite . since the bi - vectors are simple ( i.e , they are wedge product of vectors ) , they correspond to @xmath58 representations of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the next step is quantization , which barrett and crane implement with a map from vectors on @xmath59 to vector operators on hilbert space @xcite . in our case",
    ", we get a map from the dual and anti - self - dual components of each bi - vector to the corresponding two sets of angular momentum operatrors @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the square modulus of each bi - vector is twice the square modulus of either its self - dual or anti - self - dual part .",
    "rovelli ( @xcite p.249 ) shows that , for su(2 ) spin networks , the area is quantized .",
    "since the self - dual and anti - self - dual parts of each bi - vector component are independent ( i.e , they form a direct sum ) and since each one is independently an @xmath62 representation , we can finally deduce that the square moduli of the self - dual and anti - self - dual components of each bi - vector is proportional resepctively to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 eigenvalues , as for su(2 ) spin networks .",
    "these factors indicate that the quantum area @xmath65 of a hinge @xmath1 , whose associated @xmath41 spin representation is @xmath66 , is @xmath67 , in the correct physical units . in the second - order formalism , the case in which the connection matrices @xmath19 depend on the vertex coordinates , the local regge - einstein action is @xmath68 @xcite , @xmath69 being the deficit angle at the hinge @xmath1 @xcite . implementing barrett - crane quantization , the action becomes @xmath70 , which is still dependent on the @xmath71 vectors @xmath24 , since the deficit angle @xmath69 is linear in the dihedral angles among the @xmath22-faces which share the hinge @xmath1 .",
    "the dihedral angles can be written in terms of the normals @xmath72 to the @xmath22 faces @xcite .",
    "therefore the partition function is    @xmath73    in the second - order formalism , the matrices @xmath19 can be expressed as functions of the @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "notice that the barrett - crane quantization makes it possible to associate a unique irreducible representation @xmath0 with each hinge @xmath1 .",
    "this is one of the requirements in the definition of spin foam . without quantizing ( see section 3 eq.[color ] )",
    "there is no unique way to make this correspondence .",
    "the sum over @xmath75 accounts for inequivalent ways of associating an irreducible representation @xmath0 of @xmath62 to each hinge @xmath1 .",
    "this is the simplest proposal for barrett - crane spin foam amplitude which has been derived from local - regge calculus in the second - order formalism .",
    "as anticipated in section 1 eq.[foam ] , the partition function can be expressed as the product of three factors : a product on the hinges , a product on the links , and a product on the vertices .",
    "contrary to what is usually claimed in standard spin foam formalism , inter - twiner coefficients are completely absent . in the usual approach to spin foam formalism @xcite p. 333",
    ", the partition function has an imaginary exponential .",
    "this choice comes from the asymptotic behavior of the ponzano - regge state sum model in three dimensional discrete quantum gravity @xcite p.335 - 36 , in the limit of large angular momentum .",
    "this imaginary exponential implies that the integration over the `` metric '' variable ( i.e. , a edge length in three dimensions ) @xcite p.333 generates a delta function , which can be expanded as a sum over the traces of the unitary irreducible representations of the group .",
    "then integration over the group variables becomes a product of inter - twiners .",
    "but it is not our case .",
    "wick rotation implies that the partition function exponential is the negative of the action , which is a real term in the local regge calculus case .",
    "therefore the integration over the `` metric '' variables does not become a delta - function , and the inter - twiner coefficients are absent in the path integral .",
    "a natural question to rise at this point is whether we can derive something like inter - twiner coefficients of this spin foam amplitude .",
    "interestingly enough , the closure constraint on the @xmath71 @xmath72 , section 2 ; eq . [ chiusura ] , implies that if we fix the link @xmath23 and the corresponding @xmath76 and sum over all other @xmath77 originating from the dual vetrex @xmath20 , we get    @xmath78    in four dimensions , four plaquettes ( i.e , metric duals of the corresponding hinges ) share the link @xmath23 on the same dual vertex @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding four bi - vectors are linearly dependent through equation [ relatto1 ] .",
    "therefore , the irreducible @xmath41 representations,@xmath79 , associated with these bi - vectors are linear dependent    @xmath80    these considerations hold for each ( dual ) link in this spin foam formalism , and generate the bc ( barrett and crane)-inter - twiners ( see @xcite p. 348",
    "finally , we can conclude that the inter - twiner coefficients correspond to the closure constraint .",
    "we have continued to search for closer relations between local regge calculus and spin foam formalism .",
    "one of the main reasons for this research is that local regge calculus converges , in measure , to continuum general relativity , and it can be easily coupled with fermionic matter .",
    "therefore any bridge between these two approaches to discrete quantum gravity would help to throw light on both the convergence of spin foam formalism to general relativity and coupling with matter .",
    "+ we started , in section 2 , with a very brief review of the basic concepts of local regge calculus in the first order formalism .",
    "section 3 reviewed the path integral expansion of local regge calculus in group - characters , as in lattice gauge theory .",
    "the form of this expansion showed a resemblance with spin foam amplitude .",
    "following the main ideas of barrett and crane , a new further quantization was proposed in section 4 .",
    "this quantization allowed a unique and un - ambiguous correspondence between each irreducible representation @xmath0 and the hinge @xmath1 .",
    "it also resulted in a quantization of hinge areas . using local regge calculus",
    ", we also proposed an amplitude for spin foam .",
    "by contrast , a spin foam amplitude based on local regge calculus does not have inter - twiner terms .",
    "we noted that inter - twiner terms can be seen as a derivations of the closure constraints of local regge calculus .",
