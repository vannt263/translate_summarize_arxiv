    "this value corresponds to a velocity of @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , if the true proper motion were zero , then the chance of observing one as high as we observed is @xmath1015% . in short ,",
    "our measurements suggest a probable apparent motion of @xmath35 , with a value of @xmath36 being very improbable , whereas a stationarity is compatible at the @xmath37 level .",
    "we have made two epochs of vlbi observations of the supernova 2008d , which was associated with the x - ray outburst xrf  080109 .",
    "our size measurements constrain the apparent outflow speed of any ejecta associated with radio emission .",
    "our fits of a spherical shell model to the 2008 may data suggest a nominal average expansion speed of @xmath38  ( taking the mean value of the measurements at 8.4 and 5.0  ghz ) .",
    "supernova ejecta usually exhibit speeds of @xmath39  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so our vlbi size measurements are entirely consistent with the radio emission being due to the interaction of a normal shell of supernova ejecta with the circumstellar material .",
    "such interaction was found to be compatible with the x - ray and optical observations of sn  2008d by @xcite .",
    "the peak radio brightness of sn  2008d was @xmath40  mjy at 8.4  ghz @xcite , corresponding to a spectral luminosity of @xmath41  erg  s@xmath12  hz@xmath12 , which is also in the range exhibited by normal type  ib / c supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "so the radio observations are fully consistent with radio emission as is seen from the normal interaction of the supernova ejecta with the csm .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , it has been suggested that relativistic ejecta are present in sn  2008d .",
    "@xcite suggested that sn  2008d / xrf  080109 might be an ordinary , long grb viewed off - axis . in this case , the models of @xcite predict that both the expansion and the apparent motion of the radio - emitting region should be relativistic .",
    "we will show that our vlbi observations provide strong constraints on the presence of any relativistic ejecta .",
    "we discuss first the expansion speed of the radio - emitting region .",
    "our observations at @xmath42  d firmly rule out an isotropic relativistic expansion , with the @xmath2 upper limit on the speed being only about @xmath43 ( see table  [ tsize ] ) . a grb - like jet oriented near the line of sight",
    "is also ruled out , as such a jet would be expected to appear roughly circular ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and expand with an apparent speed well over @xmath36 .    a relativistic jet with a narrow opening angle lying exactly in the plane of the sky",
    "would be expected to have an elongated morphology , and expand with an apparent speed of @xmath44 .",
    "a jet not exactly in the plane of the sky would exhibit apparently superluminal expansion .",
    "if we conservatively assume a jet not exactly in the plane of the sky , of which only the approaching jet is visible , then the major axes of the fitted elliptical gaussian on 2008 may 21 suggest at best transrelativistic apparent expansion , with nominal apparent speeds of 1.2 and 0.7  @xmath36 at 5.0 and 8.4  ghz , respectively .",
    "although our @xmath2 upper limits ( @xmath45 ; see table  [ tsize ] ) are compatible with modestly relativistic expansion , even for a jet with a modest lorentz factor of 5 , our upper limits are only compatible with jets at angles @xmath46 to the line of sight because jets at smaller angles would have apparently superluminal expansion above our observational limits . in summary , although our measurements of the size of the radio - emitting region can not conclusively rule out a relativistic jet , they suggest more modest speeds .    a stronger constraint on relativistic ejecta , however , comes from our small observed proper motion .",
    "@xcite show that the flux centroid of an off - axis grb jet would show a large proper motion for periods of one month or longer .",
    "scaling their values to our distance of 28  mpc , we find that the flux centroid would show a proper motion of @xmath47  ( corresponding to an apparent speed of @xmath48 ) .",
    "our @xmath2 upper limits to the proper motion of the peak brightness point , which will be almost equivalent to the flux centroid , is only 4  ( @xmath49 )",
    ". we can therefore exclude superluminal motion between @xmath15 and 133  days .",
    "in fact our measured proper motion is consistent with sn  2008d / xrf  080109 being stationary , as would be expected of the emission from an ordinary , roughly isotropically expanding supernova , which is expected to have a proper motion of less than a few hundred , as has been measured , for example , for sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "we can compare our results , for example , to the gamma - ray burst , a nearby ( @xmath50 ) burst , whose angular size was measured using vlbi @xcite .",
    "if it were in ngc  2770 , grb  030329 would have had an angular diameter of @xmath103.6  mas ( fwhm of a gaussian ) at @xmath51  d. this is larger than any of our @xmath2 upper limits on the angular size . in figure  [ fsizes ] , we plot the size against the age for sn  2008d , and compare it to those measured for grb  030329 , and for sn  2001em , another type  ib / c supernova that was a candidate for an off - axis grb but was shown to have only supernova expansion velocities , as well as for sn  1993j , a typical type  iib supernova .",
    "we note that a more recent measurement of sn  2001em by @xcite further limits the expansion velocity of sn  2001em , and an additional 1.6  ghz measurement by @xcite is consistent with the plotted results .",
    "our ( @xmath52 ) upper limits on the extent of sn  2008d are considerably lower than the sizes measured for grb  030329 , with sn  2008d showing subluminal expansion , while grb  030329 shows superluminal expansion till @xmath53  d.    the prospect of seeing an off - axis grb event , which ought to be at least @xmath54 more common than those seen as grbs , continues to prove elusive .",
    "no emission clearly associated with an off - axis burst has been identified , although fairly strong afterglow is emission expected from such jets , particularly in the radio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the type  ib / c sne 2002ap @xcite and 2003jd @xcite were both suggested to possibly harbor off - axis grb jets due to their spectral resemblance to grb - sne ( e.g. , sne 1998bw , 2003dh and 2003lw ) in neither case , however , was the expected late - time radio emission seen up to an age of @xmath102 years @xcite .",
    "indeed , a survey searching for radio emission from off - axis jets associated with type  ib / c sne found no such emission , implying that @xmath55% of type  ib / c sne are in fact associated with grb jets @xcite .",
    "the presence of relativistic ejecta was suggested both for sn  2001em and sn  2008d , based on their strong x - ray and/or radio emission . both were bright enough in the radio to allow vlbi imaging , which provides the best measurements of the angular size and proper motion , and thus the most direct observational constraint on the presence of relativistic ejecta . in both cases",
    ", the vlbi images showed no evidence for any radio - bright relativistic ejecta .",
    "it would seem , therefore , that neither high velocity optical features , nor bright radio and x - ray emission are reliable indicators of a relativistic grb explosion .",

    "we report on two epochs of vlbi observations of the unusual supernova 2008d which was associated with the x - ray outburst xrf  080109 .",
    "the presence of an x - ray outburst and the high velocities observed in early spectra led to the suggestion that relativistic ejecta were present in sn  2008d .",
    "our vlbi observations rule out an isotropic relativistic outflow . even in the case of a jet - like outflow near the plane of the sky , although our upper limit on the angular expansion is compatible with velocities of up to @xmath56 , the upper limit on the proper motion of the brightness peak suggests a sub - relativistic velocity of @xmath57 ."
