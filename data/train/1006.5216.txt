    "it is clear that some new cp violation mechanism beyond the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase in the standard model ( sm ) is needed in order to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "moreover , several hints for the existence of some new cp violating phases are revealed in the low energy processes , such as the @xmath17 puzzle in @xmath18 decays , the large cp asymmetry ( cpa ) of @xmath10 in the @xmath19 decay , inconsistent time - dependent cpas between @xmath20 and @xmath21 decays , etc @xcite .",

    "if the semileptonic b - hadron decays do not involve a cp phase , the charge asymmetry is directly related to the mixing - induced cpas in @xmath26-meson oscillations ( see the detailed analysis later ) .",
    "although the errors of the data are still large , the deviations from the sm could be attributed to the new cp violating phases in @xmath27 and @xmath28 transitions @xcite .    inspired by the new d measurement and other cpas measured earlier , we illustrate that the anomalies can be induced by the new exotic vector - like quarks in the so - called vector - like - quark model ( vqm ) . unlike the conventional four - generation model with the fourth left - handed quarks being an @xmath8 doublet , the vector - like quarks ( vqs ) are all @xmath8 singlets , as the ones naturally realized in @xmath29 models @xcite .",
    "since the left - handed vqs carry the same hypercharge as the right - handed quarks in the sm , interestingly the model leads to z - mediated flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at tree level @xcite .",
