    "massive stars play a fundamental role in driving the energy flow and material cycles that influence the physical and chemical evolution of galaxies . despite receiving much attention",
    ", their formation process remains enigmatic .",
    "observationally , the large distances to the nearest examples and the clustered mode of formation make it difficult to isolate individual protostars for study .",
    "it is still not certain , for instance , whether massive stars form via accretion ( similar to low mass stars ) or through mergers of intermediate mass stars .",
    "advances in instrumentation , have enabled ( sub ) arcsecond resolution imaging at wavelengths less affected by the large column densities of material that obscure the regions at shorter wavelengths .",
    "recent observations exploiting these capabilities have uncovered the environment surrounding _ individual _ massive protostellar systems . from analysis of @xmath42.3 @xmath0 m co bandhead emission ,",
    "@xcite have inferred keplerian disks very closely surrounding ( within a few au ) four massive young stellar objects , while interferometric , mm - continuum observations , find the mass - function of protostellar dust clumps lies close to a salpeter value down to clump radii of 2000au @xcite .",
    "these high resolution observations point toward an accretion formation scenario for massive stars .",
    "further discrimination between the two competing models is possible by examining the properties , in particular the young stellar populations , of hot molecular cores .",
    "the mid - infrared ( mir ) window ( 7 - 25 @xmath0 m ) offers a powerful view of these regions .",
    "the large column densities of material process the stellar light to infrared wavelengths , and diffraction limited observations are readily obtained .",
    "recent observations indicate that class ii methanol masers exclusively trace regions of massive star formation  @xcite and are generally either not associated or offset from uchii regions  @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter m05 ) have carried out multi - wavelength ( mm to mir ) observations toward five star forming complexes traced by methanol maser emission to determine their large scale properties .",
    "they found that maser sites with weak ( @xmath510mjy ) radio continuum flux are associated with massive ( @xmath650m@xmath7 ) , luminous ( @xmath610@xmath8l@xmath7 ) and deeply embedded ( a@xmath940 mag ) cores characterising protoclusters of young massive ( proto)stars in an earlier evolutionary stage than uchii regions .",
    "the spatial resolution of the observations ( @xmath68@xmath2 ) was , however , too low to resolve the sources inside the clumps .",
    "details of the regions from observations in the literature are described in m05 .",
    "we have since observed three of the m05 regions at high spatial resolution to uncover the embedded sources inside the cores at mir wavelengths .",
    "the data were obtained with michelle . ] on the 8-m , gemini north telescope in queue mode , on the 18@xmath10 , 22@xmath11 and 30@xmath10 of march 2003 .",
    "each pointing centre was imaged with four n band silicate filters ( centred on 7.9 , 8.8 , 11.6 and 12.5 @xmath0 m ) and the qa filter ( centred on 18.5 @xmath0 m ) with 300 seconds on - source integration time .",
    "g173.49 and g188.95 were observed twice on separate nights and g192.60 observed once .",
    "the n and q band observations were scheduled separately due to the more stringent weather requirements at q band .",
    "the standard chop - nod technique was used with a chop throw of 15@xmath2 and chop direction selected from msx images of the region , to minimise off - field contamination .",
    "the spatial resolution calculated from standard star observations was @xmath4 0.36@xmath2 at 10 @xmath0 m and @xmath4 0.57@xmath2 at 18.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "the 32@xmath2x24@xmath2 field of view fully covered the dust emission observed by m05 in each region .",
    "particular care was taken to determine the telescope pointing position but absolute positions were determined by comparing the mir data to sensitive , high resolution , cm continuum , vla images of the 3 regions ( minier et al . in prep ) .",
    "similar spatial distribution and morphology of the multiple components allowed good registration between the images .",
    "the astrometric uncertainty in the vla images is @xmath41@xmath2 .",
    "flux calibration was performed using standard stars within 0.3 airmass of the science targets .",
    "there was no overall trend in the calibration factor as a result of changes in airmass throughout the observations .",
    "the standard deviation in the flux of standards throughout the observations was found to be 7.4 , 3.1 , 4.4 , 2.4 and 9% for the four n - band and 18.5 @xmath0 m filters respectively . the statistical error in the photometry",
    "was dominated by fluctuations in the sky background .",
    "upper flux limits were calculated from the standard deviation of the sky background for each filter and a 3@xmath12 upper detection limit is used in table  1 .",
    "similarly , a 3@xmath12 error value is quoted for the fluxes in table  1 ( typical values for the n and q band filters were 0.005 and 0.03 jy respectively ) .",
    "the flux densities for the standard stars were taken from values derived on the gemini south instrument , t - recs which shares a common filter set with michelle .",
    "regions confused with many bright sources were deconvolved using the lucy - richardson algorithm with 20 iterations .",
    "this was necessary to resolve source structure and extract individual source fluxes .",
    "the instrumental psf was obtained for each filter using a bright , non - saturated standard star .",
    "the results were reliable and repeatable near the brighter sources when using different stars for the psf and observations of the objects taken over different nights .",
    "as a further check , the standard stars were used to deconvolve other standards and reproduced point sources down to 1% of the peak value after 20 iterations , so only sources greater than 3% of the peak value were included in the final images .",
    "the resulting deconvolutions are shown in fig 1 .",
    "[ tab_sources ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as the large scale clump dust and gas morphology appears simple and centrally peaked ( see m05 ) , we make the reasonable assumption that the protocluster centres coincide with the central peak of dust emission .",
    "the spatial distribution of the point sources within the protocluster is similar between the clumps with close point sources toward the cluster centre .",
    "the methanol masers are found closest to the brightest mir point source ( within the assumed 1@xmath2 pointing error from image registration ) .",
    "these sources have temperatures sufficient to evaporate methanol ice from the dust grains into the gas phase ( @xmath690k ) as well as sufficient luminosity of ir photons to pump the masing transition ",
    "conditions models suggest are required for such emission  @xcite .",
    "it is known that more massive stars favour cluster centres ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but it is unclear whether they form there or migrate in from outside .",
    "we have used the simple - harmonic model of ballistic motion developed by  @xcite to consider the motion of sources within the cores . using the measured column density and radius from m05 ( listed in table  2 ) ,",
    "the time required for migration from the edge to the centre is @xmath4 @xmath13 years .",
    "this is comparable to the predicted hmc lifetime of 10@xmath14 years @xcite so we can not rule out the possibility of migration within the clumps .",
    "any sources having migrated to the centre in this way would have acquired a velocity of @xmath4  2  kms@xmath15 with respect to the clump .",
    "massive stars in clusters are observed to have a high companion star fraction  @xcite . in the m16 cluster ,",
    "@xcite observed massive stars ( earlier than b3 ) with visual companions separated by 1000 - 3000au .",
    "if multiple systems are bound from birth , it is likely some of the sources we have observed will belong to multiple systems , even though the companions may lie below the detection limit .",
    "however , all three regions show two or more point sources at close angular separation ( see insets of figure 1 ) corresponding to linear separations of 1700 to 6000au . we can not determine whether these stars are physically bound or simply close due to projection effects but we can calculate the instrumental sensitivity required to confirm or deny the association .",
    "assuming they are physically bound in a keplerian orbit , the maximum proper motions ( projection angle = 0@xmath16 ) of @xmath4 0.1 mas / year are too small to be detected on short temporal baselines . the maximum velocity difference ( projection angle = 90@xmath16 )",
    "@xmath4 2 kms@xmath15 is achievable by high spectral resolution observations of any line features .",
    "the mass distribution of stars is generally well described as a power law through the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "given the mass of gas available to form stars , we may estimate the likelihood that a cluster will end up with the most massive stars that are observed in it .",
    "the fraction of gas that forms stars is given by the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and is observationally found to be less than 50% in any cloud and to be @xmath17 33% for nearby embedded clusters @xcite . for a cluster whose total stellar mass is 120 ( 50 , 320 ) m@xmath7 ( equivalent to the gas mass determined for the three cores ) , @xcite estimate that the mean maximum mass that a star may have in it is 10 ( 5 , 20 ) m@xmath7 .",
    "this is comparable to the largest observed mass in two out of the three cases .",
    "however , we also observed several other stars in each cluster so can estimate the probability of generating stars of equal or greater mass than the remaining mass distribution .",
    "we did this by running monte - carlo simulations to populate 10@xmath14 clusters using @xcite , @xcite and @xcite imfs until the available gas mass was exhausted .",
    "we only considered clusters which contained a star of at least equal mass to the most massive observed .",
    "the simulations show that even using the salpeter form of the imf ( most biased toward forming high - mass stars ) and allowing 50% of the gas to form stars , it is difficult to generate the observed mass distributions ( probabilities @xmath18 10@xmath19 , 10@xmath20 , 10@xmath15 for the three cores respectively ) . by itself , this may not be significant for a single cluster .",
    "however , since the probability is low for all three sources studied , it is unlikely that the mass distribution of the most massive stars can be produced by sampling a standard form of the imf from the reservoir of gas available for star formation .",
    "this conclusion would not hold if there was a substantial stellar mass already in the cluster that remains unseen , or if much of the original gas mass had already been dispersed from the core due to star formation .",
    "the former requires a sfe close to unity and given the relatively quiescent state of the cores , the latter seems unlikely .",
    "a larger sample of young , massive protoclusters is required to draw general conclusions . however , in all three hot molecular cores traced by methanol maser emission we have found :    * multiple , mir sources which can be separated into three morphological types : unresolved point sources ( p ) ; unresolved point source with weak surrounding extended emission ( pe ) and extended sources ( e ) . * the point sources lie at close angular separations .",
    "future high spatial and spectral resolution observations may be able to determine whether or not they are physically bound . *",
    "the methanol masers are found closest to the brightest mir point source ( within the assumed 1@xmath2 pointing accuracy ) .",
    "* cooler , extended sources dominate the luminosity . *",
    "the time scale for a source at the core edge to migrate to the centre is comparable to the hot molecular core lifetime , so it is not possible to rule out large protostellar motions within the core .",
    "* from the derived gas mass of the core and mass estimates for the sources , monte carlo simulations show that it is difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the core using a standard form of the imf .",
    "this conclusion would not hold , however , if most of the original gas has already formed stars , or has been dispersed such that the original core mass is much greater than now observed .",
