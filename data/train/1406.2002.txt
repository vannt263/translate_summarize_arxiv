    "understanding the formation and evolution of the most massive galaxies and the most massive black holes powering active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is a fundamental goal for observational and theoretical cosmology .",
    "when did these objects form ?",
    "what processes assembled them ? what is the relation between star formation and black hole formation ?",
    "seeking the most luminous , most extreme quasars is a straightforward observational goal to determine some of these answers .",
    "these quasars can be traced to the highest redshifts , and the most luminous , most massive galaxies and quasars are those whose formation is most difficult to explain .",
    "the challenges in understanding the formation mechanisms and formation epoch for the most massive galaxies are recently summarized by @xcite and for the earliest supermassive black holes by @xcite .",
    "evidence that the formation processes of stars , galaxies and agn are related arises from the observed correlation between concentrated masses in the centers of galaxies ( presumed to be supermassive black holes ) and the mass of the surrounding halo of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a result ,",
    "preferred scenarios form large numbers of stars rapidly in extended haloes while simultaneously feeding and enlarging the central black holes , thereby powering a central agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "scenarios which connect the formation of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes imply that finding the most luminous quasars in the early universe also determines the epoch when the most massive galaxies were forming .",
    "such scenarios have been pursued in increasing detail for 25 years , beginning with an attempt @xcite to explain the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "the explanation proposed for these very dusty , very luminous sources was that they begin with the merger of smaller gas rich galaxies .",
    "the merging process allows sufficient angular momentum loss that large amounts of gas can settle into dense clouds which produce extensive starbursts while some gas continues to the center to power accretion and enlarge any existing black hole @xcite .",
    "dust produced by the rapid evolution of massive stars obscures the agn and reradiates in the infrared the large intrinsic luminosity produced from the core regions at shorter wavelengths . as the radiated power of the accretion disk increases , the surrounding dust is blown away , and an unobscured central quasar is revealed @xcite .",
    "observations of the irregular , merged structure of ulirgs @xcite , of the changing infrared spectral classification of starbursts to agn during the evolving process @xcite , and of the required winds for gas ejection @xcite strengthen this scenario observationally .",
    "modeling @xcite predicts the timeline and luminosity behavior of the dusty merger process which leads to both a massive galaxy and a luminous quasar .",
    "existing models match long standing observations of quasar evolution which showed that the peak luminosity of optically discovered quasars occurs at a redshift z @xmath2 2 .",
    "observational development of this conclusion began with the demonstration by @xcite that quasars were systematically more luminous in the past and was refined through various quasar surveys @xcite .",
    "this epoch of maximum luminosity for quasars is similar to the epoch initially determined as that of maximum star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which encouraged the development of scenarios to explain how both events can occur together .",
    "recent observations of dusty sources not present in optical surveys suggest , however , that very luminous and rapid star formation together with the associated quasars occurred much earlier , at redshifts exceeding 4 @xcite .",
    "this is potentially an important result if it pushes the formation epoch of the most massive galaxies and most luminous quasars to an earlier time ; the difference between z = 2 and z = 4 halves the time available for massive galaxy and black hole formation ( down to 1.5 gyr from the beginning of the universe at z = 4 from 3.2 gyr at z = 2 ) .",
    "because of observations and models which indicate that the earliest phases of luminous quasars and starbursts may be characteristically dusty , it is important to trace luminous sources using their dust luminosity because the dust can diminish or extinguish the optical and ultraviolet luminosity .",
    "we pursue several objectives in the present paper by using dust luminosity to trace the most luminous quasars as a function of redshift . our first goal is to determine if an epoch of peak dust luminosity can be identified .",
    "then , we compare infrared and ultraviolet luminosities to seek any observable changes in dust content as a function of epoch or luminosity for the most luminous quasars .",
    "finally , we compare luminosity functions for dust - obscured and unobscured quasars to compare luminosities and to determine what fraction of luminous quasars are obscured by dust .    as a measure of dust luminosity , @xmath0(7.8  ) ( subsequently called  infrared luminosity \" ) is used for the reasons summarized in @xcite , who show that this correlates well with other measures of agn luminosity such as hard x - ray luminosity , black hole mass , and high ionization emission line luminosity .",
    "these authors also review the scaling between @xmath0(7.8  ) and total infrared luminosity or total bolometric luminosity .",
    "the choice of an exact 7.8 wavelength is determined by the mid infrared continuum maximum between absorbing features in heavily obscured sources ( described and illustrated below in section 4.2 ) .    in the present paper , the 7.8 luminosity",
    "is determined for several samples of quasars using newly available infrared data and used to consider three specific and related objectives .",
    "our first objective ( section 2 ) is to determine @xmath0(7.8  ) for the brightest optically discovered quasars , which are those quasars in the quasar catalog of @xcite arising from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , gunn et al .",

    "this comparison also leads to our quantitative definition of  unobscured \" quasars , defined by the ultraviolet to infrared luminosity ratios for sdss quasars . by comparing the ultraviolet / infrared luminosity ratio to redshift and ultraviolet luminosity , we test in this section some expectations of the dusty merger scenario .    finally , in section 4",

    "the template is restricted to this wavelength range because shorter wavelengths are not dominated by dust emission , and longer wavelengths show large dispersion in spectra because the silicate feature at @xmath9 10 can have widely varying strength , either in emission or absorption .",

    "the sdss is carefully defined regarding the photometric selection criteria @xcite , but the photometric selection of quasars for some redshifts is incomplete because of confusion with the colors of stars .",
    "in addition , the presence of different emission lines in the broad band filters at different redshifts means that the photometric selection is not based strictly on continuum luminosities .",
    "fainter continuum sources can be boosted into the sample and quasar selection enhanced if the photometric magnitudes are made brighter by strong emission lines .",

    "the redshift distributions are corrected to illustrate how the redshift distribution would appear if sources of given continuum luminosity were evenly selected at all redshifts , as shown graphically in figure 8 of richards et al . and figure 7 of schneider et al .",
    "to determine corrected luminosity functions at each redshift bin that we utilize in table 1 , we apply the graphical correction of @xcite to correct all space densities in the observed luminosity functions .",

    "this comparison leads to our quantitative definition of unobscured quasars defined by the ultraviolet to infrared luminosity ratios for sdss quasars .",
    "we also use these ratios to test some expectations of the dusty merger scenario @xcite .    obscuring dust in a quasar",
    "can affect in two ways the ratio @xmath0(0.25 ) /@xmath0(7.8 ) , subsequently  ultraviolet / infrared ratio ( uv / ir ) \" . if the covering fraction for dust clouds surrounding the quasar increases , a larger fraction of the intrinsic ultraviolet luminosity is absorbed and reradiated by dust .",
    "this increases infrared luminosity , thereby decreasing uv / ir , even if the observed ultraviolet luminosity is not diminished by dust extinction . for constant covering fractions ,",
    "the observed ultraviolet luminosity can decrease ( as in type 2 sources ) if dust happens to intervene and lower the observed ultraviolet luminosity because of extinction , which lowers uv / ir without any enhancement of the infrared luminosity .    the uv / ir ratio ,",
    "therefore , is a measure of dust content regardless of whether the dust leads to increased ir or decreased uv .",
    "we use the term  obscuration \" to refer to this change in observed dust content , whether arising from increased covering factor for dust and resulting increase in infrared luminosity , or arising from increased extinction of ultraviolet luminosity by dust in the line of sight .",
    "either effect of obscuration decreases uv / ir , so examining quasars for systematic change in uv / ir as a function of redshift or luminosity determines if there is a systematic change in dust content .",
    "our interpretations of systematic changes in uv / ir which follow are applied only to statistical medians for samples of sources ; individual objects can deviate from the medians because of various factors such as differences in extinction laws , opacity of obscuring dust clouds , and dust geometry .      the sdss quasar data in @xcite give a consistent , monochromatic measure of ultraviolet continuum flux density , which is the @xmath12(0.25 @xmath10 m ) at the observed wavelength corresponding to rest frame 0.25 . the @xmath0(0.25 )",
    "is a measure of observed luminosity from the accretion disk which can be compared to reradiated dust luminosity @xmath0(7.8 ) .",
    "the ultraviolet / infrared ratio for the sdss / wise quasars is shown in figures 5 and 6 , compared to both luminosity and to redshift .",
    "these comparisons are restricted to the most luminous quasars , log @xmath0(0.25 ) @xmath6 47 , and to z @xmath1 4 in order to maximize the fraction of 22 detections .",
    "these luminosity and redshift limits are chosen so that the number of upper limits on @xmath0(7.8 ) for sources undetected by wise ( corresponding to lower limits on the ultraviolet / infrared ratio ) is small enough that the median value of the ratio at most redshifts and luminosities is not affected by detection limits .",
    "because quasars in the sdss are the brightest known in the rest frame ultraviolet , they must include those quasars having minimal extinction of the ultraviolet .",
    "consequently , we subsequently refer to these as  unobscured \" quasars , and the ultraviolet / infrared luminosity ratio for such quasars is defined by the results in figures 5 and 6 . in section 4 , a specific comparison is made between luminosity functions of unobscured and obscured quasars within the redshift interval 1.8 @xmath31 z @xmath1 2.4 .",
    "figure 6 shows that in this redshift range , the smallest value of log [ @xmath0(0.25 ) /@xmath0(7.8 ) ] is @xmath9 0.2 for sdss / wise quasars .",
    "this value is adopted as the limiting ultraviolet / infrared ratio for unobscured quasars ; no sdss / wise quasars are more obscured than this limiting value even though this limiting value may include some amount of extinction .",
    "larger values of the ultraviolet / infrared ratio would correspond to higher ultraviolet luminosities , possibly because of less extinction .",
    "this limiting value of 0.2 is used in section 4.1 to define the amount of ultraviolet obscuration seen in the sample of obscured quasars used for comparison to the sdss quasars .",
    "the results in figures 5 and 6 can test some of the expectations of the dusty merger models for producing luminous quasars and the associated massive galaxies .",
    "these models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) explain the epoch of maximum observed ultraviolet luminosity for quasars ( z @xmath9 2.5 ) as that time when quasars had maximum accretion rates leading to maximum bolometric luminosities .",
    "the ultraviolet luminosities become visible as the surrounding dust clouds disperse .",
    "one expectation from these models , therefore , is that quasars of the highest bolometric luminosity should still have larger covering fractions for dust clouds than cleaner quasars of less luminosity .",
    "observational support for dusty merger models is provided by conclusions that the most luminous quasars with z @xmath1 3 do indeed contain the most dust @xcite .",
    "for the quasars with large dust covering fractions to be also those which are most luminous in the ultraviolet , as explained in the dusty merger models , the ultraviolet luminosity must escape between surrounding dust clouds without extinction along the observer s line of sight .",
    "in such cases , a high ultraviolet luminosity should be accompanied by low values of uv / ir , because the large dust covering fraction must enhance the fraction of bolometric luminosity absorbed by the dust and reradiated in the infrared .",
    "the comparison of uv / ir to ultraviolet luminosity in figure [ ratio_lum ] does not show this expected result .",
    "the medians as well as the upper and lower envelopes of points in figure 5 indicate that uv / ir increases by a factor of @xmath9 3 when the ultraviolet luminosity increases by a factor of 10 .",
    "this observational result indicates that dust content is minimized in the most ultraviolet luminous quasars .",
    "this could happen because either the covering fraction of dust clouds decreases as the luminosity increases , thereby reducing the infrared luminosity , or there is less intervening dust producing ultraviolet extinction , thereby increasing the observed ultraviolet luminosity .",
    "based on irs spectra observing silicate emission in quasars and type 1 agn , @xcite concluded that the explanation is because the covering fraction decreases with increasing ultraviolet luminosity .",
    "another expectation arising from the dusty merger models is that the epoch ( z @xmath9 2.5 ) of maximum observed ultraviolet luminosity when surrounding dust clouds just begin to dissipate should show quasars with larger dust content than at later epochs ( lower redshifts ) when quasar luminosities have declined and dust content has diminished .",

    "this expectation is tested in figure  [ ratio ] , comparing the ratio @xmath0(0.25 ) /@xmath0(7.8 ) to redshift .",
    "no systematic trend in ultraviolet / infrared ratio with redshift is observed in figure  [ ratio ] that indicates a decrease in dust content and increase in uv / ir as quasars at z @xmath32 2.5 dissipate the surrounding dust .",
    "the maximum ratio , log @xmath0(0.25 ) /@xmath0(7.8 ) = 0.65 , occurs at z = 2.9 rather than at lower redshifts , although this maximum is not significantly different from the median ratio ( 0.49 ) within the uncertainties .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this result is that the ultraviolet / infrared ratio is primarily controlled by changes in the ultraviolet extinction along the line of sight instead of by changes in the covering fraction of the dust . in this case",
    ", the maximum uv / ir at z = 2.9 arises because of minimum extinction at that redshift . in summary ,",
    "none of the results in figures 5 and 6 are consistent with explaining the apparent peak in quasar ultraviolet luminosity at z @xmath9 2.5 as a real peak in bolometric luminosity using the simplified expectations of the dusty merger scenario .",
    "maximum quasar ultraviolet luminosities which are observed seem to be determined primarily by small changes in extinction rather than by particular stages of mergers which control the accretion rate and covering fraction of surrounding dust clouds .",
    "our analysis of uv / ir , therefore , does not find any supporting evidence based on this parameter that the epoch of peak intrinsic bolometric luminosity for quasars has been found .",
    "the preceding analyses of dust content for sdss quasars omits any population of quasars so obscured by dust that they are not found in the sdss . yet , dusty quasars are the initial phases of luminous quasars according to the dusty merger scenario , so dusty quasars should dominate quasar samples at the earliest epochs . tracing the covering fraction of dust as a function of redshift would measure the transition from early , heavily obscured quasars to later , unobscured quasars .",
    "infrared observations make it possible to discover quasars that were not included in optically derived samples because of heavy dust obscuration ( the dogs ; dey et al .",

    "our primary goal in this section is to compare luminosity functions for heavily obscured quasars to luminosity functions for the unobscured quasars in optical surveys .",
    "surveys of obscured quasars are not yet adequate to make this comparison over a wide redshift range . because of the redshift selection effects in the sample of obscured quasars , this determination can most reliably be done at a redshift z @xmath9 2 . with such a luminosity function as reference , eventual surveys of dusty quasars that reach to higher redshifts can define evolution of the luminosity function at higher redshifts for dust obscured quasars .",
    "various studies have revealed a population of obscured agn , usually considered as type 2 agn , that is comparable with or exceeds type 1 agn , perhaps depending on luminosity @xcite . this obscured population has been confirmed photometrically in the infrared using colors from the @xmath8 infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",

    "a variety of observing programs using surveys at 24 with the @xmath8 mips instrument @xcite combined with subsequent irs spectra were designed to find dust obscured populations of optically faint sources .",
    "as reviewed in section 1 , the obscured population found in this way led to recognition of the dogs .",
    "the dogs overlap in characteristics with many of the compton thick , obscured x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "dogs have redshifts derived from irs spectra using either strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features , with the strongest at 7.7 , or strong silicate absorption centered at 9.7 . by analogy to similar spectra in low redshift sources having both optical classifications and irs",

    "all of these results lead to the conclusion that the apparent maximum in quasar ultraviolet luminosity at z @xmath9 2.5 is not a measure of the actual peak in intrinsic quasar bolometric luminosity but is probably the result of diminished extinction of the ultraviolet compared to other epochs . to find the real epoch of maximum quasar luminosity , it is necessary to extend infrared searches for obscured quasars to redshifts z @xmath41 5 . at such redshifts ,",
