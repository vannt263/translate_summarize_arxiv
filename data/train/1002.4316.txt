    "power - law distributions of spectra of signals , including @xmath1 noise ( also known as @xmath1 fluctuations , flicker noise and pink noise ) , as well as scaling behavior in general , are ubiquitous in physics and in many other fields , including natural phenomena , human activities , traffics in computer networks and financial markets .",
    "this subject has been a hot research topic for many decades ( see , e.g. , a bibliographic list of papers by li @xcite , and a short review in scholarpedia @xcite ) .    despite the numerous models and theories proposed since its discovery more than 80 years ago @xcite , the intrinsic origin of @xmath1",
    "noise still remains an open question .",
    "there is no conventional picture of the phenomenon and the mechanism leading to @xmath1 fluctuations are not often clear .",
    "most of the models and theories have restricted validity because of the assumptions specific to the problem under consideration .",
    "a short categorization of the theories and models of @xmath1 noise is presented in the introduction of the paper @xcite .    until recently ,",
    "probably the most general and common models , theories and explanations of @xmath1 noise have been based on some formal mathematical description such as fractional brownian motion , the half - integral of the white noise , or some algorithms for generation of signals with scaled properties @xcite and the popular modeling of @xmath1 noise as the superposition of independent elementary processes with the lorentzian spectra and a proper distribution of relaxation times , e.g. , a @xmath2 distribution @xcite .",
    "the weakness of the latter approach is that the simulation of @xmath0 noise with the desirable slope @xmath3 requires finding the special distributions of parameters of the system under consideration ; at least a wide range of relaxation time constants should be assumed in order to allow correlation with experiments @xcite .    nonlinear stochastic differential equation with linear noise and non - linear drift , was considered in ref .",
    "it was found that if the damping is decreasing with increase of the absolute value of the stochastic variable , then the solution of such a nonlinear sde has long correlation time .",
    "recently nonlinear sdes generating signals with @xmath1 noise were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also recent papers @xcite ) , starting from the point process model of @xmath1 noise @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to derive the behavior of the power spectral density directly from the sde , without using the point process model .",
    "such a derivation offers additional justification of the proposed sde and provides further insights into the origin of @xmath1 noise .",

    "according to wiener - khintchine relations , the power spectral density is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the autocorrelation function .",
    "for the stationary process the autocorrelation function can be expressed as an average over realizations of the stochastic process , @xmath27 this average can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the steady - state probability distribution function and @xmath30 is the transition probability ( the conditional probability that at time @xmath31 the signal has value @xmath32 with the condition that at time @xmath33 the signal had the value @xmath5 ) .",
    "the transition probability can be obtained from the solution of the fokker - planck equation with the initial condition @xmath34 .",
