    "plasticity of crystalline materials is mainly dominated by mobility of dislocations , which can move at much lower stress levels than theoretical strength of a perfect crystal.@xcite dislocations interact with other lattice defects such as voids or precipitates .",

    "( [ logarithmiclaw ] ) , which is shown by blank triangles in fig .",
    "[ r - crss ] .",
    "then we discuss the case that edgelike constriction does not occur . in this case ,",
    "cross slip that is initiated by screwlike constriction does not propagate towards the other end of the dislocation .",

    "the twosegments recombine there to leave an intrinsic prismatic loop .",
    "( d ) an intrinsic prismatic loop is left behind . ]    in this process , it is found that the depinning stress is approximately twice larger than eq .",
    "( [ logarithmiclaw ] ) .",
    "the reason is explained as follows . because the superjog can be regarded as a pinning point as well as the void , the spacing between pinning points @xmath37 is effectively half the original value when it is formed in the midsection of a pinned dislocation . by replacing @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ logarithmiclaw ] ) by @xmath60 , we can expect the depinning stress is twice . however , we remark that a superjog is not always formed in the midsection . in such a case",
    "the depinning stress becomes much larger because the effective distance between the pinning points is less than @xmath60 .",
    "for example , in one case ( the solid triangle shown in fig .",
    "[ r - crss ] ) , a superjog is formed in such a way that the distance between the void and the superjog is @xmath61 . as a result , the depinning stress is three times larger than the ordinary depinning stress described by eq .",
    "( [ logarithmiclaw ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we study pinning dynamics of a screw dislocation .",
    "we find two novel depinning mechanisms , both of which involve cross slip on the void surface .",
    "these pinning mechanisms are relevant to intermediate - high temperatures , because cross slip requires the activation energy .",
    "the two mechanisms result in higher depinning stresses than previously predicted by a continuum model . in the following , we remark three important points that are closely related to these mechanisms .",
    "although we find two novel depinning mechanism , the following question still remains ; which mechanism is dominant under a given condition ? from fig .",
    "[ r - crss ] , it is obvious that the prismatic loop formation process ( i.e. , mechanism b ) is more likely at high temperature ( @xmath29 ) k , whereas mechanism a is dominant at @xmath0 k. therefore , we can deduce that an additional activation process is essential to mechanism b.    in order to specify this process , we have to recall that mechanism b requires partial double cross slip before edgelike constriction occurs , the configuration of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ doublecrossslip ] .",
    "partial double cross slip is preceded by recombination of two partials on @xmath59 and redissociation on @xmath30 , which must be thermally activated . because the width of stacking fault ribbon on @xmath59 is narrow due to the restricted geometry of the glide plane with respect to the void ,",
    "this process is much easier than edgelike constriction on@xmath30 .",
    "however , the precise energetics of this process is not straightforward .",
    "the reason is that it occurs at the early stage of the pinning process , where the average shear stress is negative .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ stressstrain ] for negative shear stress at the early stage ) .",
    "in such a situation spatiotemporal behavior of the shear stress near the void and the dislocation may be violent .",
    "we remark another possible mechanism other than the two mechanism presented in section v. consider an intermediate stage of mechanism a , where the dislocation is on the @xmath59 plane after edgelike constriction occurs . then bowing and depinning on",
    "the @xmath50 plane can occur under different shear loading .",
    "for example , consider the case in which the maximum shear stress is applied to @xmath62 plane . in this case , the shear stress is equally applied to four @xmath63 planes so that the depinning stresses with respect to these four glide planes are equivalent .",
    "thus the only barrier against depinning is edgelike constriction , which can be overcome by intermediate shear stress . in such configurations",
    ", void can enhance cross slip and may play an important role in the nature of plasticity , particularly in work - hardening .",
    "however , note that voids must be sufficiently large and temperatures must be high in order to realized cross slip via screwlike constriction .",
    "we remark that partial evidences for the existence of these phenomena are observed in experiments using transmission electron microscopy.@xcite in addition , because the shear rate is extremely high in md simulations , an intrinsic prismatic loop that is produced by the present depinning mechanism may be somehow related to vacancy clusters that are frequently observed in high - speed deformation . @xcite",
    "further effort toward experimental validation of the depinning mechanisms proposed by the present md simulation is in progress .                                            as we will see in the later sections , constriction and cross slip are more difficult with wide stacking fault ribbon .",
    "it implies that void - induced cross slip occurs more easily in experiments than in the present simulation .",
    "this plane - symmetry of the initial strain field makes an apparent contrast to a screw dislocation in the elastic body of infinite volume , whose strain field is cylindrically symmetric .",
    "but this is not realizable in md simulations because the computational cell is finite .",
    "note that this alternative approach is employed by several studies and seems to be reliable.@xcite"
