    "moreover , the recent controversy in the low - mass wimp region @xmath0(10 gev / c@xmath1 ) , where several dark matter hints are inconsistent with null results  @xcite , highlights the need for additional discrimination power between wimp events and backgrounds in order to clearly authenticate a genuine wimp signal .",

    "each of these detection techniques share the common goal of discriminating a potential wimp signal from residual backgrounds by either comparing the different amount of energy released in scintillation , ionization and heat , and/or using pulse shape discrimination .",
    "depending on the readout strategy being considered , direct detection experiments can have access to the number of wimp candidates contained in the data set , their recoil energies and directions . in this study",

    "is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 the wimp mass , @xmath7 the wimp - nucleus reduced mass , @xmath8 the local dark matter density , and @xmath9 is the wimp - nucleus cross section .",

    "finally , @xmath17 is the three - dimensional radon transform of the wimp velocity distribution @xmath18 which has the following expression for the standard halo model ( shm )  @xcite : @xmath19 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2_v}\\right]}.\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the isotropic velocity dispersion , @xmath21 is the circular velocity taken to be equal to 220  km / s in the following and @xmath22 is the lab velocity vector with respect to the galactic rest frame .",
    "the latter will be further detailed below . as one",
    "can see from this equation , the directional rate is maximum when @xmath23 ( maximum along a ring , see  @xcite ) , if @xmath24 , or when @xmath25 otherwise ( dipole feature , see  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we can see that the recoil direction is strongly correlated with the lab s motion in the galactic frame , which will lead to a nonambiguous authentication of a genuine wimp signal  @xcite .",
    "note that we have considered the shm model even though recent results from n - body simulations indicate that this maxwell - boltzmann assumption might be an oversimplification  @xcite .",
    "further , the existence of many possible substructures such as streams and a dark disk could create distinct features in the velocity distribution  @xcite , and then have important implications in the interpretation of dark matter data .",
    "however , since the goal of this paper is to compare different readout strategies within a consistent picture to what is being used to derive existing constraints , we will consider this simplified halo model .",
    "as discussed above , the directional event rate is strongly correlated to the lab velocity vector in the galactic rest frame .",
    "it is given by the sum of the rotation of the solar system around the galactic center @xmath26 , the solar system peculiar velocity @xmath27 , the earth s revolution @xmath28 and the earth s rotation @xmath29 .",

    "for a detector located at a latitude @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the north pole , @xmath37 is aligned with the spin axis of the earth .",
    "finally , in the detector frame , the direction of a recoil is given by the angle @xmath39 and @xmath40 defined as such : @xmath41    figure  [ fig : sidereal ] ( left panel ) shows the evolution of the direction of @xmath42 in the detector s coordinates system as a function of sidereal time for @xmath43 varying from -90@xmath34 to 90@xmath34 .",
    "the middle and right panels illustrate the angular distributions of wimp induced nuclear recoils at 50 kev as observed in the detector s frame , at different sidereal time , along the @xmath39 and @xmath40 angles .",

    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : sidereal ] , due to the earth s revolution , the directional dark matter event rate is highly dependent on the sidereal time and on the latitude at which the experiment is located .",
    "it is also worth noticing that an experiment only sensitive to the @xmath39 angle ( 1d directionality ) or the @xmath40 angle ( 2d directionality ) should still be able to distinguish between a dark matter signal and an isotropic background .",
    "in this section we introduce the analysis methodology used in the following in order to assess the discovery potential of each readout strategies .",
    "discovery limits were first introduced in  @xcite , in the context of directional detection , and are defined such that if the true wimp model lies above such limit , then an experiment has a 90% chance to get at least a @xmath46 discovery .",
    "the calculation of the discovery significance is based on the standard profile likelihood ratio test statistic  @xcite where the likelihood function is defined as , @xmath47\\times\\mathscr{l}(r_b),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the expected number of wimp and background events , and the total number of observed events . note that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the background rate . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the unit normalized event distributions for the wimp and the background contributions .",
    "@xmath55 corresponds to the set of observables @xmath56 , depending on the readout considered , associated to each observed nuclear recoil , and @xmath57 is its sidereal time .",
    "finally , @xmath58 is the likelihood function related to the background rate of the experiment .",
    "the latter is parametrized as a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation given by the relative uncertainty on the expected background rate @xmath59 .",
    "the profile likelihood ratio corresponds to a hypothesis test against the null hypothesis @xmath60 ( background only ) and the alternative @xmath61 , which includes both background and signal , while incorporating any type of systematic uncertainties such as the background normalization . in the context of a discovery significance estimate",
    ", we are interested in testing the background only hypothesis ( @xmath60 ) on the data and try to reject it using the following likelihood ratio : @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the values of @xmath52 that maximizes @xmath64 for the specified @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we are profiling over @xmath52 which is considered as a nuisance parameter . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the test statistic @xmath66 is then defined as : @xmath67 as one can deduce from such test , a large value of @xmath66 implies a large discrepancy between the two hypotheses , which is in favor of a discovery interpretation .",
    "following wilk s theorem , @xmath66 asymptotically follows a half @xmath68 distribution with one degree of freedom ( see ref.@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "in such a case , the significance @xmath69 in units of sigmas of the detection is simply given by @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth noticing that such analysis methodology is particularly relevant to recent dark matter searches analyses and was first introduced by the xenon10 collaboration  @xcite . today",
    ", many experiments , such as lux  @xcite , cdms  @xcite , and cogent  @xcite , are also using likelihood approaches as their background estimates and related systematics , based on simulations and calibration data , are getting more and more reliable .",
    "the great interest of using likelihood analyses is that they offer a possible interpretation of the data , assuming that both the signal and background models are accurate , and lead to the best dark matter sensitivity .",
    "in this section , we describe the characteristics of the detector considered hereafter .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will consider a xe - based experiment located in modane ( @xmath44 ) with a nuclear recoil energy range from 5 to 100 kev .",
    "as mentioned above , we will assume that the detector s reference frame is such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are , respectively , pointing toward the north , west , and zenith directions and that the @xmath39 and @xmath40 angles are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : angles ] ) . in all results shown below",
    ", we will assume a wimp mass of 50 gev / c@xmath1 which leads to a mean recoil energy of @xmath7110 kev and is usually where most xenon - based experiments have their best wimp sensitivities .",
    "neglecting the impact of the form factor which varies from target to target , equivalent directional signals can be found by adjusting the energy range for each target  @xcite .",
    "for example , a similar wimp - induced recoil distribution would be obtained for @xmath72f target with @xmath73 kev . in the following",
    ", we will consider 5 types of detector readout strategies :    * counting experiment : the detector is only able to measure a total number of events above some threshold .",
    "this is the case for the bubble chamber experiments  @xcite , which adjust their operating pressure to nucleate a single bubble from a nuclear recoil . *",
    "energy : this category corresponds to the bulk part of direct detection experiments where only the energy of the events is being measured  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus is , in most cases , derived from multiple component measurements : heat / ionization for semiconductor cryogenic detectors , ionization and scintillation such as xe- and ar - based dual - phase tpcs , and heat / scintillation for cryogenic scintillating crystals . *",
    "energy + 3d : the energy and the track of the recoiling nucleus are fully measured .",
    "this is the ultimate readout strategy that fully exploit the information from the expected wimp signal .",
    "current directional experiments are using low - pressure gaseous tpc in order to get few mm tracks associated to @xmath74 kev nuclear recoils . for 3d sensitive directional detectors ,",
    "the track is measured by sampling over time the 2 dimensional projection of the ionization - induced electron cloud on a pixelized anode ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the drawback of such detection techniques is that current directional detectors only have about @xmath710.1 kg of target material and are therefore not yet competitive with the above mentioned experiments . *",
    "energy + 2d : the energy is being measured as well as the 2d projection of the recoil track onto the ( x , y ) plane of the detector to have access to the @xmath40 angle .",
    "this is the case of most current directional detectors that do not have access to a time sampling of the track projection on the anode  @xcite . *",
    "energy + 1d : the energy is being measured as well as the 1d projection of the track along the z - axis to have access to the @xmath39 angle .",
    "this would be the case for a dual - phase xe or ar tpc looking for columnar recombination where the electric field would be aligned along the z - axis , taken to be pointing toward the zenith direction .",
    "note that such detection technique has only very recently been suggested by d. nygren  @xcite but has generated an increasing interest .",
    "so far , we have no experimental evidence that such effect would be measurable at the kev - scale as it requires both tracks sufficiently long and high energy resolutions on both the ionization ( s2 ) and scintillation ( s1 ) channels .",
    "so far , only the scene collaboration has seen a possible deviation , at @xmath7160 kev for argon recoils , in the s1 signal between tracks selected to be perpendicular or parallel to the electric field  @xcite .",
    "although several ideas on how to enhance this columnar recombination effect exist  @xcite , we are not yet at the stage where such detectors are able to realize a highly efficient directional detection of dark matter .",
    "however , it is certainly worth looking into the discovery potential of an hypothetical 1d directional sensitivity especially as such detectors would not suffer from low - mass target material , unlike gaseous directional detectors .",
    "also , it is worth noticing that this work is the first addressing the discovery potential of such 1d directional readout .    for all readouts , unless otherwise stated , we will consider the case of an ideal detector as this study is meant to compare the ultimate reach of each of these detection techniques .",
    "moreover , a comprehensive study of the impact of realistic detector limitations , such as energy and angular resolutions and energy thresholds , has been done in  @xcite where a similar profile likelihood technique were used .",
    "this section is dedicated to presenting our results in the comparison of the different type of readouts that are sensitive to the different observables of a potential wimp signal : number of wimp induced nuclear recoils , their energy and their direction . throughout this study",
    ", we considered an isotropic background with an exponential energy distribution with a slope of either 10  kev or 100  kev .",
    "the motivation for choosing an isotropic residual background comes from the fact that residual neutrons in an underground laboratory have been estimated to closely follow an isotropic distribution  @xcite .",
    "the relative uncertainty on the background rate estimate is taken to be equal to @xmath75% which is of similar order to what was considered in the recent lux analysis  @xcite and is comparable to uncertainties on the ultimate neutrino background  @xcite .",
    "+ figure  [ fig : lambda ] shows the evolution of the number of wimp events required to get a 3@xmath76 detection significance in 90% of the experiments as a function of the signal purity @xmath77 for all 5 readout strategies .",
    "the left and right panels correspond to a background energy slope of 100 kev and 10 kev respectively .",
    "note that in the 10 kev case ( right panel ) , the energy distribution of the background and the one induced by a 50 gev/@xmath45 wimp are very similar . from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] ( both panels ) one can see that the number of required wimp events to achieve a significant dark matter discovery increases as the signal purity decreases .",
    "also , one can notice that the `` counting '' readout , which can not distinguish a genuine wimp event from the background , saturates around @xmath78 .",
    "this comes from the fact that below such value , the background contribution is so important that because of its associated normalization uncertainty @xmath59 it is not possible to get a significant discovery anymore .",
    "note that the breaking point @xmath78 only depends on the relative uncertainty on the background normalization considered .",
    "indeed , if @xmath59 increases , this breaking point tends to values closer to @xmath79 .",
    "for example , with @xmath59 = 50% we found this breaking point to be equal to @xmath80 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] ( left panel ) , where we expect a reasonable discrimination in energy between the wimp signal and the background , that the `` energy only '' and the four directional readouts give comparable sensitivities . as a matter of fact , at the lowest signal purity @xmath81 , we find that the number of required events to reach a high significance discovery using only the information in energy is about a factor 1.6 higher than if this information is combined with a full 3d track measurement .",
    "this means that the 50 gev / c@xmath1 wimp energy distribution is sufficiently different from the one of an exponential background with a slope of 100 kev that directional information does not completely overcome the `` energy only '' readout used by most direct detection experiment .",
    "additionally one can notice that 2d and 1d readouts are roughly comparable and about only a factor 1.3 worse , at the lowest signal purities , than a 3d readout .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] ( right panel ) , one can see that the results are significantly different if we consider a background model characterized by an energy distribution that mimics very well the expected wimp induced energy distribution .",
    "indeed , in such a case , measuring only the energy of the events does not bring discrimination power between the two hypotheses . as a matter of fact",
    ", one can see that the `` energy only '' scenario is equivalent to the `` counting only '' scenario down to @xmath82 .",
    "however , below such signal purity , one can see that the number of required wimp events jumps to about 1000 at @xmath78 but does not saturate unlike the `` counting only '' case .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the two spectra , wimp and background , are not exactly alike , especially in the tail as the wimp energy distribution is not exactly an exponential distribution .",
    "therefore with sufficiently high statistics , one can discriminate between the wimp and the background hypotheses .",
    "this is why the `` energy only '' case can still perform a high significance detection of dark matter below @xmath78 but at the price of a huge increase in exposure . unlike the energy spectrum",
    ", no background can potentially mimic exactly the directional distribution of wimp induced nuclear recoils .",
    "therefore , no matter the level of signal purity , there is always sufficient discrimination between the wimp and background events to reach a highly significant dark matter detection even with only a 2d or a 1d readout , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] .",
    "the interest of such study is that it gives us a sense on how each directional readout strategies perform compare to each other when the discrimination along the energy alone is negligible . as one can see , all three directional readout strategies are about 2 orders of magnitude below the `` energy only '' case .",

    "once the experiments start to be sensitive to the background contamination , we can observe different behaviors .",
    "the `` counting only '' case saturates for an expected number of background events higher than 100 as no background subtraction is possible . for completeness",
    ", the effect of annual modulation on the `` counting only '' case has also been investigated and is shown to only improve on the sensitivity at very high exposures due to the small ( @xmath71 2% ) modulation in the event rate expected for such wimp mass , recoil energy range and background rate uncertainties .",
    "note that no improvements were found by taking into account annual modulation effects with the other readout strategies . in the `` energy only '' case",
    ", the sensitivity has a similar behavior than the `` counting '' case as the background and wimp energy spectra are very similar .",
    "however , for expected number of background events higher than 1000 , the small differences in the two energy distributions allow the `` energy only '' readout to perform some background subtraction hence leading to a sensitivity scaling as @xmath84 .",
    "note that this behavior is very similar to what was observed in the case of the neutrino background  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , one can see that all three directional readouts have sufficient discrimination as they directly get to a background subtraction mode , characterized by a sensitivity scaling as @xmath84 , when the background becomes important enough . finally , from fig .",

    "also , we have shown that 1d and 2d readouts are only less efficient than a full 3d readout by about a factor of 3 and @xmath7110 with and without sense recognition capabilities .",
    "however , as 1d readouts based on columnar recombination are not expected to be sensitive to the sense of recoiling nucleus they will only improve on the `` energy only '' readout by about a factor of 2 .",
    "but on the other hand , such detection technique could easily have sufficient target material to be competitive with current large - scale dark matter detectors and suffer much less from the irreducible neutrino background .",
    "it is however worth emphasizing that , even though a 1d directional sensitivity could greatly help at convincingly detecting dark matter , a 3d readout would be necessary to characterize its velocity distribution in our vicinity and begin the era of `` wimp astronomy ''  @xcite . + * acknowledgments* the author would like to thank anne green and frdric mayet for their comments and suggestions on this work and also alexandre juillard and jules gascon for fruitful discussions .",

    "<S> over the past decades , several ideas and technologies have been developed to directly detect weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) from the galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> all these detection strategies share the common goal of discriminating a wimp signal from the residual backgrounds . by directly detecting wimps , one can measure some or all of the observables associated to each nuclear recoil candidates , such as their energy and direction . in this study , we compare and examine the discovery potentials of each readout strategies from counting only ( bubble chambers ) to directional detectors ( time projection chambers ) with 1d- , 2d- , and 3d - sensitivity . using a profile likelihood analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the case of a large and irreducible background contamination characterized by an energy distribution similar to the expected wimp signal , directional information can improve the sensitivity of the experiment by several orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that 1d directional detection is only less effective than a full 3d directional sensitivity by about a factor of 3 , or 10 if we assume no sense recognition , still improving by a factor of 2 or more if only the energy of the events is being measured . </S>"
