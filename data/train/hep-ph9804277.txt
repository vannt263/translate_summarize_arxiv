    "supersymmetric left - right models ( susylr ) where the @xmath3 gauge symmetry is broken by triplet higgs fields with @xmath4 have many attractive features : 1 ) they imply automatic conservation of baryon and lepton number@xcite , a property which makes the standard model so attractive , but is not shared by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ; 2 ) they provide a natural solution to the strong and weak cp problems of the mssm@xcite ; 3 ) they yield a natural embedding of the see - saw mechanism for small neutrino masses@xcite where the right handed triplet field ( @xmath5 ) that breaks the @xmath3 symmetry also gives heavy mass to the righthanded majorana neutrino needed for implementing the see - saw mechanism .    in order to cancel anomalies as well as to maintain supersymmetry below the @xmath3 scale ( @xmath6 )",
    ", one needs a pair of fields @xmath7 with @xmath8 respectively .",
    "an important distinguishing characteristic of these higgs multiplets is that they contain doubly charged higgs bosons and higgsinos in them that remain as physical fields subsequent to symmetry breakdown .",
    "it has recently been shown that the vacuum of the theory may or may not conserve r - parity@xcite .",
    "if however we require the ground state to conserve r - parity , one must include higher dimensional operators@xcite or additional higgs fields which break parity@xcite . in this case , @xcite the model in its simple versions , always predicts that some of the doubly charged fields mentioned above are massless in the absence of the higher dimensional operators ( hdo ) .",
    "this is independent of whether the hidden sector supersymmetry breaking scale is above or below the @xmath0 scale . in the presence of hdo s",
    ", they acquire masses of order @xmath9 .",
    "since the measurement of the z - width at lep and slc implies that such particles must have a mass of at least 45 gev , this puts a lower limit on the @xmath0 scale of about @xmath10 gev or so .",
    "this result is interesting since @xmath0 masses in this range also lead to neutrino masses expected on the basis of current solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "if we take the @xmath0 mass to be close to this lower limit ( say of order @xmath11 gev ) , it implies the masses of the doubly charged particles in the 100 gev range .",
    "there are two bosonic and two fermionic particles of this type",
    ". the rest of the particle spectrum below the @xmath0 scale can be same as that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a massive neutrino or it can have an extra pair of higgs doublets in the 10 tev range depending on the structure of the model .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to explore the constraints on the parameters of the model and suggest tests in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 collider .",
    "our main results are that for a large range of parameters in this model the stau ( the superpartner of @xmath2 ) is the lightest of the sleptons due to the renormalization group running arising from the @xmath14 coupling which is not very constrained from phenomenology .",
    "( note that the @xmath15 couplings to other leptons are severely bounded by the recent psi results on muonium- antimuonium oscillation@xcite ) . as a result , tau lepton final states , generated from the production of the @xmath16 and its fermionic part ,",
    "provide a crucial signature of this class of models .",
    "for instance we find that detection of final states of type @xmath17 plus missing energy or @xmath18 with or without missing energy in both @xmath13 and @xmath12 collsion will provide test of these models .",
    "thus non - observation of such signals will significantly reduce the domain of allowed parameters of this model .",
    "we point out the difference between the multi @xmath2 signals of this model and the same type of signals that appear in the other models e. g. conventional gmsb type .",
    "we will show that the allowed region of parameter space is larger when we choose gmsb type of theories .",
    "we also discuss the unification prospects of this model in different susy breaking scenarios .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we review the arguments leading to the existence of light doubly charged fields despite a high @xmath0 scale in the context of a simple model and discuss the low energy interactions of these fields ; in section 3 we discuss gauge unification in these models ; in section 4 , we discuss its parameter space and experimental signals in gravity mediated susy breaking scenario ; in section 5 , we discuss the same for the gauge mediated susy breaking scenarios and in section 6 we present our conclusion .",
    "in this section , we present a brief review of the arguments leading to the existence of the light doubly charged higgs fields in the susylr model . in order to give our arguments , we start by giving the basic features of the model , which is based on the gauge group @xmath19 . in table",
    "i , we give the particle content of the model .",
    "we will suppress the @xmath20 indices in what follows . +    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      + table 1:field content of the susy lr model ; we assume that @xmath21 + is odd under parity ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the @xmath24 transformations respectively .",
    "the superpotential for this theory is given by ( we have suppressed the generation index ) :    @xmath25 + \\lambda s(\\delta\\overline{\\delta } -\\delta^c\\overline{\\delta^c } ) + \\mu_s s^2 \\nonumber\\\\   & + &   \\mu_{ij } { \\rm tr } ( \\tau_2 \\phi^t_i \\tau_2 \\phi_j ) + w_{\\it nr } \\label{eq : superpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 denotes non - renormalizable terms arising from higher scale physics such as grand unified theories or planck scale effects .",

    "we will work in the vacuum which conserves r - parity .",
    "the higgs vevs then have the following pattern : @xmath29 similar pattern for @xmath30 is assumed .    using eq . 1",
    ", one can give a group theoretical argument for the existence of light doubly charged particles in the supersymmetric limit as follows .",
    "let us first ignore the higher dimensional terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 as well as the leptonic couplings @xmath33 .",
    "it is then clear that the superpotential has a complexified @xmath34 symmetry ( i.e. a @xmath34 symmetry whose parameters are taken to be complex ) that operates on the @xmath5 and @xmath35 fields .",
    "this is due to the holomorphy of the superpotential .",
    "after one component of each of the above fields acquires vev the resulting symmetry is the complexified @xmath36 .",
    "this leaves 10 massless fields .",
    "once we bring in the d - terms and switch on the gauge fields , six of these fields become massive as a consequence of the higgs mechanism of supersymmetric theories . that leaves four massless fields in the absence of higher dimensional terms .",
    "these are the two complex doubly charged fields .",
    "of the two non - renormalizable terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 , only the a - term has the complexified @xmath34 symmetry .",
    "hence the supersymmetric contribution to the doubly charged particles will come only from the b - term .",
    "it is then clear that the masses of the doubly charged fields are of order @xmath37 . requiring that these masses satisfy",
    "the z - width bound then implies that @xmath38 gev or so . in this paper",
    "we will assume that @xmath6 is at the lower bound value so that the doubly charged fields are accessibly to the existing collider experiments .",
    "note incidentally that although the leptonic couplings do not respect the above mentioned symmetry , they are unimportant in determining the vacuum structure as long as r - parity is conserved and hence they do not effect the doubly charged field masses .",
    "let us now give an explicit calculation of the masses of the doubly charged fields in the supersymmetric limit using the superpotential in eq.(1 ) .",
    "let us write down the f - terms for the @xmath21 , @xmath39 and @xmath5 terms : @xmath40 if the effective supersymmetry breaking scale is below the @xmath0 scale , then these @xmath41 terms must vanish .",
    "it is then clear that if we choose the @xmath5 and @xmath42 vev s ( denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath43 ) to be nonvanishing ( and they are equal in the supersymmetric limit ) , then we must have @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath39 and @xmath45 vev s vanish and the masses of these fields are of order @xmath46 .",
    "thus the left triplet fields decouple from the low energy spectrum .",
    "it is then easy to see from the superpotential ( in the absence of the a and b terms ) that all the particles in the superfields @xmath5 and @xmath42 are massless in the limit of exact supersymmetry .",
    "one linear combination of the neutral fields and another ofsingly charged fields disappear due to the higgs mechanism .",
    "the remaining singly charged and neutral higgs fields pick up mass of order of @xmath6 and disappear from the low energy spectrum .",
    "the story of the doubly charged fields is however very different in this theory as has been shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "once supersymmetry breaking is turned on but the higher dimensional terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 are excluded from the analysis , these fields acquire negative mass - squares signalling the breakdown of electric charge .",
    "this problem is cured as soon as the @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms are included .",
    "the doubly charged fields ( all of them ) then acquire masses of order @xmath37 and the vacuum becomes charge conserving .",
    "let us now discuss the higgs doublet spectrum of the model at low energies . at the @xmath0 scale ,",
    "one generally takes two bi - doublet fields @xmath47 s to make the model realistic . in order to get the mssm at low energies",
    ", one must decouple one pair of @xmath48 and @xmath49 from the low energy spectrum .",
    "this has been called doublet - doublet splitting problem in literature . in the model without hdo contributions , it is clear from the superpotential in eq .",
    "( 1 ) that doublet higgsino matrix is symmetric : @xmath50 if we now do fine tuning to get one pair of @xmath51 at low energies , the @xmath51 appear as identical combinations of the doublets in @xmath52 s . as a result , at the mssm level",
    ", we have proportionality of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 leading to vanishing ckm angles .",
    "this result holds even if we increase the number of bi - doublets arbitrarily and uses only the fact that bilinear mass matrix @xmath55 is symmetric .",
    "this in fact raises the interesting possibility@xcite that all mixing angles in the quark and lepton sector may arise purely out of radiative corrections involving the soft breaking terms@xcite .",
    "an advantage of this version of the model is that there are no new flavor changing effects other than those from the usual supersymmetric sources@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", one may choose the @xmath55 parameters of this model to be of the order of electroweak scale so that the low energy model is not exactly the mssm but rather the two higgs pair extension of mssm .",
    "the phenomenology of these models are very similar to the previous case except that there are new contributions to the flavor changing neutral current effects in this model similar to those in the nonsupersymmetric left - right models@xcite which puts a lower limit on the masses of the second pair of higgs doublets to be in the 5 - 10 tev range . as a result they will essentially decouple from the low energy spectrum .",
    "our results are independent of which of the above choices for the higgs sector is made , except that unification discussion applies only to the second version .",
    "the presence of the doubly charged fields at low energies distinguishes the gauge coupling evolution in this model from the mssm and one might expect that one will lose the unification property .",
    "it however turns out that the gauge couplings do unify in this model , albeit at a lower scale as we see below , for the case which has two pairs of higgs doublets at the weak scale .",
    "the couplings evolve according to their respective beta functions .",
    "as just mentioned , below the @xmath6 scale , we assume four higgs doublet fields instead of the usual two of mssm and we assume that one of the doublet pairs has mass of 10 tev .",
    "they lead to a trivial modification of the beta function below @xmath6 .",
    "the beta functions above the @xmath6 scale are given below for one loop : @xmath56 and in the following equation for the two - loop : @xmath57 where @xmath58 respectively in the matrices , @xmath59 is the number of fermion generations . @xmath60 always and @xmath61 is the number of bidoublets which we take to be 2 .",
    "we also take @xmath62(@xmath63 ) and @xmath64(@xmath65 ) to be 1 . since the @xmath66 leaks down to the weak scale , we need to include its contribution to the running of the gauge couplings in between the weak and the intermediate scale . since this field @xmath39 has only hypercharge quantum number under the sm representation , the hypercharge gauge coupling rge gets an extra term of 24/5 in one loop and in the two loop , the hypercharge squared elements gets and additional factor @xmath67 .",
    "we see from figure 1a . that the gauge couplings unify at a scale @xmath68 gev and the intermediate scale is @xmath69 gev .",
    "we take @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 at the weak scale .",
    "the low unification scale implies that the proton decay constraint would rule out groups like so(10 ) .",
    "however the final unifying group can be @xmath73 or any group that conserves baryon number .    in the supergravity motivated models ,",
    "the gauge unification is necessary in order to have gaugino mass unification .",
    "the masses of all the sparticles can then be determined in terms of the parameters e.g. universal scalar mass @xmath74 at the unification , universal gaugino mass @xmath75 and the triliniear coefficient in the potential a s .",
    "we will assume the a s to be 0 .",
    "we choose to assume the universality of @xmath74 at the unification scale rather than at the planck scale for two reasons : first is that we do not know the theory above the unification scale and the nature of the evolution of the parameters is obviously dependent on those details .",
    "the second reason is that the experimental signature we are interested in involves only the tau lepton and its partner and not the other super particles of the theory .",
    "so even if we assumed universality of scalar masses at the planck scale which would necessarily imply some splitting between generations due to running between the planck scale to the unification scale , our final conclusions will be uneffected by this .",
    "if we use gmsb ( gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models ) models where susy breaking is communicated to the observable sector by gauge mediation , the soft susy breaking scalar and the gaugino masses are generated at a scale @xmath76 gev by gauge interactions . in this type of models",
    "gauge unification is not necessary in order to have unified gaugino mass , since they are generated in one loop . in our calculation for the gmsb cases",
    "we do not consider any gauge unification .",
    "however in figure 1b we show one example where we have the gauge unification with a messenger sector composed of : one copy of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the couplings unify at @xmath80 gev , the intermediate scale is at @xmath81 gev and the @xmath82 is 1/2 at the intermediate scale .",
    "( dmdeltafig1.epsf width 7 cm )    ( dmdeltafig2.epsf width 7 cm )",
    "in the standard gravity mediated scenarios , one starts with a universal mass - square for all scalar components of the chiral superfields at the planck scale and they are then extrapolated to the weak scale to determine their masses@xcite .",
    "for those fields with large yukawa couplings such as the higgs doublet @xmath83 , top squark , the weak scale value is significantly lower than the planck scale one .",
    "( in fact , for the @xmath83 turning negative gives rise to the celebrated phenomenon of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ) . for other squarks , the gaugino mass contribution has the effect of increasing their value over the planck scale value . on the other hand for the sleptons ,",
    "the change between the weak scale and planck scale value is not very significant since they neither have large yukawa couplings nor do they have strong interactions .",
    "turning now to the susylr model , as mentioned before , we will assume universality at the unification and in contrast with the mssm , the effective theory below the right handed scale , contains the following new coupling in the superpotential : @xmath84 which will have a major impact on our spectrum at the weak scale .    in writing the above coupling",
    ", we have used the fact that experimental limits on lepton flavor changing processes such as @xmath85 and @xmath86 imply that @xmath87 with @xmath88 are very small compared to the diagonal couplings @xmath89 and have therefore taken the liberty to simply drop the off - diagonal couplings . in what follows , we will denote @xmath90 .",

    "recent psi experiment@xcite has yielded an upper limit on @xmath93 . for @xmath94",
    "gev , this implies that @xmath95 .",
    "thus we expect each of the couplings to be less than @xmath96 barring pathological situations where only one of the couplings bears the brunt of the constraint . on the other hand",
    "there is no such constraint on @xmath97 from experiments .",
    "so we will choose it to be of order 0@xmath98 .",
    "the first implication of the relatively large @xmath97 is on the weak scale value for the mass of the @xmath39-boson .",
    "as shown in @xcite , at the @xmath6 scale , both the @xmath39 and its fermionic partner @xmath99 ( @xmath39-ino ) have nearly the same mass .",
    "the bosonic component however runs faster than the fermionic one . as a result , at low energies we can expect that @xmath100",
    "this has important implications for phenomenology .",
    "a second consequence of the possible large @xmath97 is that the @xmath101 mass is drawn down to smaller values at lower scales . in order to calculate the mass spectrum we use the fermion masses , mixing angles , @xmath33 s and the magnitude of the gauge couplings as inputs at the weak scale .",
    "we use @xmath102 gev and @xmath103 .",
    "we then use the rge s shown in the appendix and in the reference @xcite to determine the yukawa and the gauge couplings at the gut scale .",
    "then we use the universal boundary conditions and use the rge s for the soft susy breaking masses and the couplings to determine the masses at the weak scale .",
    "we determine the parameter @xmath104 from the condition that electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively .",
    "we choose the sign of @xmath104 to be negative , since the other choice will give large @xmath105 rate",
    ". the lighter stau mass will be much smaller than the other sleptons ( even when @xmath106 is small ) due to the presence of the new coupling @xmath107 . in figure 3",
    "we show the mass contours of the lighter stau ( dotted line ) , the @xmath16 ( solid line ) and the lighter selectron(dot - dashed line ) in the @xmath74 and @xmath106 plane for @xmath108 .",
    "we choose @xmath109 mass @xmath110 gev at the weak scale ( 90 gev at the intermediate scale ) .",
    "as @xmath74 increases the @xmath16 mass decreases due to the subtractive effect in the rge originating from the larger soft susy breaking scalar mass .",
    "we can see from the figure that the bound on @xmath16 mass rules out the upper range of @xmath74 .",
    "the lower bound on lighter stau ( @xmath111 ) mass on the other hand rules out lower range of @xmath74 .",
    "the latest bound on lighter stau mass is about 57 gev @xcite . in this scenario @xmath112 mass is too high to be pair produced at lepii .",
    "we also observe ( due to the smallness of @xmath113 compared to @xmath107 ) that the lighter selectron mass is much higher than the @xmath111 mass even when the @xmath114 is small for the same @xmath74 and @xmath75 values .",
    "this will differentiate between the final states of chargino pair production in mssm and in this model . in fig 4",
    "we show the same mass contours for @xmath115 gev at the weak scale ( 70 gev at the intermediate scale ) .",
    "lower @xmath16 mass indicates lesser effect on the @xmath111 mass from the new interactions and consequently more parameter space for lower @xmath74 , however low @xmath39 mass rule out more parameter space from the higher @xmath74 range . in this scenario",

    "the soft susy breaking gaugino and the scalar masses at the messenger scale @xmath155 are given by @xcite    @xmath156    and    @xmath157    where @xmath158 are the three sm gauge couplings and @xmath159 for su(3 ) , su(2 ) , and u(1 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath160 are zero for gauge singlets , and 4/3 , 3/4 , and @xmath161 for the fundamental representations of @xmath162 and @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively ( with @xmath165 defined by @xmath166 . here",
    "@xmath167 corresponds to @xmath168 .",
    "@xmath169 and @xmath170 are messenger scale threshold functions with @xmath171 .",
    "we calculate the susy mass spectrum using the appropriate rge equations @xcite with the boundary conditions given by the equations above and we vary five free parameters @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath106 , @xmath167 and the sign of @xmath104 ( @xmath104 is the coefficient of the bilinear higgs term in the superpotential ) .",
    "we first run the yukawa couplings ( along with the three new couplings @xmath174 ) and gauge couplings from the weak scale upto the gmsb scale . at the gmsb scale we use the boundary conditions and then use the necessary rges for the soft susy breaking masses in order run down to the weak scale .",
    "the cleo constraint on the @xmath105 rate restricts @xmath175 @xcite . in the absence of late inflation",
    ", cosmological constraints put an upper bound on the gravitino mass of about @xmath176 ev @xcite , which restricts @xmath177 . in the figures we show the results for n=1 , but we discuss the other values of n also . for reasons discussed before",
    ", we assume that @xmath113 are small ( @xmath178 ) , but @xmath107 is larger .",
    "we show our result for @xmath179 and @xmath120 .",
    "we also vary @xmath124 between 70 - 120 gev at the gmsb scale .",
    "the gravitino is always the lsp . in the usual gmsb case the @xmath117 and the @xmath111 fight for the nlsp spot . in this model",
    "the @xmath109 also joins the race to become nlsp . the third generation lighter stau mass gets affected due to the presence of the additional large coupling @xmath97 .",
    "thus the @xmath111 is much smaller compared to the conventional gmsb case for the same parameter space .",
    "consequently the lighter stau will be the nlsp for a wider region of parameter space compared to the lighter neutralino .    in figure 11a",
    "we have shown the mass contours of @xmath111 ( solid line ) , @xmath121 ( dotted line ) , @xmath117 ( dash - dotted line ) and the chargino masses ( dashed line ) for @xmath180 , n=1 and @xmath181 gev at the gmsb scale ( 94 gev at the weak scale ) . we also show the contour along which the lighter stau mass and the neutralino mass are same ( thick solid line ) .",
    "the region above the contour has lighter stau as the nlsp .",
    "we see that only a small region for @xmath106 3 - 15 and @xmath172 40 - 60 tev has @xmath117 as nlsp .",
    "when @xmath117 is the nlsp , it decays into a photon and a gravitino .",
    "if @xmath117 is pair produced at lepii , the final state has @xmath182 plus @xmath183 .",
    "the photons are hard and easy to detect .",
    "already we have bound on the @xmath117 mass of around 80 gev at lep ii @xcite provided the selectrons are not too heavy .",
    "we can see that if we use @xmath117 mass bound as 80 gev , the region left out in fig 11a where @xmath117 is the nlsp is very small .",
    "the region where @xmath111 is the nlsp , which is the dominant region , stau decays into a high @xmath125 @xmath2 and a gravitino ( missing energy ) .",
    "so far there is not much bound in these regions , other than the @xmath111 has to be larger than 57 gev . in the figures we have shown the stau mass contours of 45 , 60 , 80 and 100 gev .",
    "the @xmath111 mass contours have large dependence on the @xmath106 , the @xmath111 decreases with the increase in @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath121 , chargino and the @xmath117 mass contours do not have much @xmath184 dependence .    in figure 11b",
    "we show the same mass contours in the plane of @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath185 .",
    "the contours along which @xmath111 mass is equal to the @xmath117 mass form an envelope . within the envelope",
    "@xmath117 is nlsp .",
    "the @xmath121 masses increase as the @xmath173 ratio increase .",
    "the couplings @xmath113 are small to affect the @xmath121 or the @xmath186 masses ( selectron and smuon masses are almost same ) .",
    "the lighter stau mass however decreases with the increase in the ratio of @xmath173 ( subtractive effect from the soft scalar masses due to the presence of the new coupling overcome effects coming from the gaugino masses in the rge ) . in the conventional gmsb model the stau mass increases with the increase in the @xmath173 ratio . with",
    "the improvement of the @xmath111 mass bound much more parameter space will be ruled out in the higher@xmath173 ratio .",
    "the @xmath117 and the chargino masses initially decrease with the increase in the ratio of @xmath173 due to the threshold corrections .",
    "the 80 gev @xmath117 bound rules out much of the parameter space in the envelope where@xmath117 is the nlsp . the @xmath187 varies between 94 - 108 gev at the weak scale . unlike the sugra scenario ,",
    "the @xmath16 mass is much larger than the fermionic part at the weak scale and its mass , in the full range shown in the figure , varies from 170 -570 gev ( due to the large soft susy breaking contribution at the gmsb scale ) .",
    "thus , the allowed parameter space in gmsb scenarios are much more than the sugra scenarios .    in figures 12 and 13 ,",
    "we have shown the mass contours in the @xmath188 plane for @xmath189 and 110 gev at the gmsb scale .",
    "the @xmath106 is chosen to be 10 .",
    "when @xmath189 gev , the envelope is larger , since @xmath190 mass has less subtractive contribution from the delta mass .",
    "on the other hand when @xmath191 gev , the envelope shrinks .",
    "the envelope can also increase in the size if we have smaller coupling @xmath107 .",
    "we show the effect of a smaller @xmath107 in figure 14 .",
    "this figure looks more like the conventional gmsb model .",
    "we see that there is no parameter space where @xmath190 is nlsp .",
    "but if we increase @xmath106 we will hit the region where @xmath190 is the nlsp .",
    "the @xmath190 mass in this case , as expected , increases with the increases in the ratio of @xmath173 .",
    "so far in all these figures we have used n=1 .",
    "the effect of larger values of n can easily be surmised from the mass formula .",
    "as n increases gaugino masses increase proportionally , on the other hand the scalar masses increase as @xmath192 .",
    "hence stau mass is the nlsp for a even wider region of parameter space .",
    "the lighter selectron s mass becomes closer to the lighter stau mass and lower than the neutralino mass .",
    "let us now discuss the signals . at lep ii ,",
    "the main production processes are the @xmath117 pair , the @xmath109 pair , the @xmath121 pair and the @xmath190 pair .    in the case of @xmath109 pair production ,",
    "each @xmath109 wll decay primarily into a @xmath190 and a tau ( both having same sign of charge ) .",
    "the other decay modes involving e.g. a electron and a @xmath121 and a muon and a smuon are suppressed primarily because of small @xmath113 couplings . in the parameter space",
    "when stau is the nlsp , @xmath109 decays into a @xmath111 and a @xmath2 and @xmath193 .",
    "thus , the final state has 4@xmath2 plus missing energy and out of the 4 @xmath2s , two have high @xmath125 ( higher @xmath125 than the sugra case ) .",
    "these two high @xmath125 @xmath2s have opposite sign electric charges .",
    "the @xmath117 pair production also gives rise to 4 @xmath2s plus missing energy ( since each @xmath194 ) , with two of these @xmath2s having high @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "however there is an essential difference between the signal in this case and in the previous case .",
    "since the neutralino is a majorana particle , the two high @xmath125 @xmath2s can have same or opposite sign ( with equal probability ) for the electric charges and thus providing a way to discrminate between the two cases .    in the case of @xmath121 pair productions",
    ", each selectron will either decay into a electron and a @xmath117 or a @xmath109 and a positron ( if the selectron mass is higher than the @xmath117 mass and the @xmath109 mass ) . both @xmath117 and @xmath109 decay to @xmath140 plus missing energy .",
    "the final states in either case will have @xmath195 plus missing energy with two of the @xmath2s having high @xmath125 .",
    "their relative sign will determine the decay channel of the selectron .",
    "if , however , the @xmath121 mass is lower than both the @xmath117 mass ( large n case ) and the @xmath109 mass , the selectron can decay into an electron and a gravitino or via offshell production of the @xmath117 or @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath117 and @xmath109 then convert into @xmath140 plus missing energy . in the former case the final state of the selectron pair production has @xmath196 plus missing energy and in the later case the signal is @xmath197 plus missing enrgy .",
    "depending on the parameter space , these offshell decay modes can be comparable or greater than the onshell decay mode @xcite . in the case of smuons the electrons in the final states",
    "will be replaced by the muons .",
    "when @xmath117 is the nlsp , the @xmath109 will decay into a @xmath111 and a @xmath2 ( 100@xmath137 ) .",
    "the @xmath111 will decay into a @xmath117 and a @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath117 then decays into a photon and a gravitino .",
    "all the branching ratios are 100 @xmath137 .",
    "the final state from the @xmath109 pair production will have @xmath198 plus missing energy - which is a spectacular signal and very hard to miss .",
    "this signal will appear along with the electrons or the muons in the case of selectron or smuon production , where the selectron decays as described above i.e. @xmath199 .    in the conventional gmsb models when @xmath117 is the nlsp case ,",
    "one gets at most 2 leptons along with 2 @xmath145 ( through the slepton productions whose cross section is much smaller than the delta - ino production cross section ) at the lep ii and at the tevatron or 3 leptons plus 2 photons ( chargino - second lightest neutralino production ) at the tevatron .",
    "thus the signal @xmath198plus missing energy will clearly distinguish this model from the ordinary gmsb models in the parameter space where @xmath117 is the nlsp .",
    "it may also happen that the @xmath109 mass is smaller than the @xmath111 or the @xmath117 mass . in that case",
    "the @xmath109 will decay into a @xmath2 and a virtual @xmath111 which will convert into a @xmath2 plus gravitino or if the @xmath117 mass is lower than the @xmath111 mass , then the @xmath111 will decay into a @xmath2 and a @xmath117 .",
    "the @xmath117 will then convert into a photon and the gravitino .",
    "thus the final states are same as discussed in the cases when @xmath117 is the nlsp or @xmath111 is the nlsp .",

    "to summarize , we have studied the phenomenological implications and the collider signatures of the remnant doubly charged higgs boson @xmath16 and its fermionic partner the deltaino @xmath109 .",
    "we find that existing limits on lepton flavor violation and muonium - anti - muonium transition can be used to conclude that the dominant coupling of these particles are diagonal and mostly to the third generation of leptons .",
    "they of course are forbidden from coupling to the quarks by electric charge conservation .",
    "the effect of the dominant third generation lepton coupling has the consequence that the @xmath190 mass is much smaller than the other slepton masses .",
