    "qsos have been found by a variety of different methods , mostly using optical photometry and spectroscopy , but also through their radio morphology and x - ray emission properties .",
    "qso searches were usually avoided in areas where source crowding was a problem , for example the galactic plane or the direction of nearby galaxies , such as the magellanic clouds .",
    "high spatial resolution of the chandra x - ray observatory limited source confusion problems for the x - ray based searches .",
    "@xcite found several quasars behind the lmc and smc , including four quasars behind the dense parts of the lmc bar by spectroscopic observations of the ogle optical counterpart of chandra x - ray sources .",
    "another efficient method of searching for quasars is based on optical variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; or more recently @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several gravitational microlensing survey groups have been monitoring hundreds of millions of stars toward dense regions such as the galactic centre , the galactic disc and/or the magellanic clouds ( eros : @xcite ; ogle : @xcite ; macho : @xcite ; moa : @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite searched qso candidates towards the magellanic clouds via variability by using the second phase of the ogle experiment ( ogle - ii ; @xcite ) variable star catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite did follow - up spectroscopic observations of 12 of these quasar candidates in the small magellanic cloud fields and confirmed 5 as qsos",
    ". they also found the color information is useful to select qsos .",
    "@xcite found about 47 qsos behind the magellanic clouds , by selecting the candidates via variability in the macho database and follow - up spectroscopic observations .    in this work ,",
    "following @xcite , we search for qso candidates via variability in ogle - ii galactic bulge fields ( @xcite ) . up to now",
    ", no qsos have been found in these regions .",
    "the main motivation for this study is that quasars may provide background sources which fix the astrometric reference frame .",
    "kinematic studies of stars ( @xcite ) would greatly benefit from having absolute astrometry .",
    "these qsos will also be useful for the future astrometric program , such as space interferometry mission ( sim ) and gaia .",
    "however , finding qsos in these fields is more challenging than in magellanic cloud fields because of the higher stellar density and higher extinction .    in  [ sec : data",
    "] we describe the data .",
    "we select qso candidates in  [ sec : select ] .",
    "discussion and conclusion are given in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "we use the @xmath2 photometric maps of ogle - ii fields ( @xcite ) , which contain @xmath2 photometry and astrometry of @xmath3 million stars in the 49 galactic bulge fields .",
    "positions of these fields ( bul_sc1 @xmath4 49 ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "we do not use bul_sc44 in this work because its extinction is too high ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the photometry is the mean photometry from a few hundred measurements in the @xmath6-band and several measurements in @xmath7-band collected between 1997 and 2000 .",
    "accuracy of the zero points of the photometry is about 0.04 mag .",
    "a single 2048 @xmath8 8192 pixel frame covers an area of 0.24 @xmath8 0.95 @xmath9 with a pixel size of 0.417 arcsec .",
    "details of the instrumentation setup can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also use the light curves of objects in the ogle - ii galactic bulge variable star catalogue ( @xcite ) which contain 213,965 variable objects .",
    "the variable object detection and the photometry have been done by using the difference image analysis ( dia ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) for the data collected during the first 3 years of the ogle - ii project .",
    "we extended the light curves to the fourth year ( 2000 ) using the method of @xcite ; however new variable object detection is not attempted for the additional data .",
    "we cross - referenced 213,965 variable objects in the variable star catalogue ( @xcite ) with objects in ogle - ii photometric maps ( @xcite ) , which are well calibrated , and extracted their @xmath7 and @xmath6 magnitudes .",
    "205,473 of them have counterparts in the photometric maps .",
    "we use these magnitudes in the following analysis .",
    "we chose 30,219 objects which are fainter than @xmath10 mag , where @xmath11 is the @xmath6-band magnitude after extinctions are corrected by using the extinction map in these fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "we show the colour magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of one of these fields in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the detection limit in the variable star catalogue is about @xmath12 mag , which corresponds to extinction corrected magnitudes of @xmath13 , depending on the level of extinction in each field .",
    "the number density of qso brighter than @xmath14 mag is @xmath15 ( @xcite ) , where the sloan @xmath16 is almost similar to the ogle @xmath6 .",
    "so in this magnitude range we expect @xmath17 qsos in our 48 fields covering @xmath18 square degrees taking the extinction into account .",
    "there are many artifacts in the variable star catalogue .",
    "the light curves of objects around bright stars are affected by the long wings of the point spread function ( psf ) of that bright star , and then they resemble that star s variability . even around a star with constant brightness , the wings can affect nearby faint stars due to variations of seeing and the psf .",
    "this effect causes the systematic gap in the brightness of faint stars around a bright star between in 1998 and in 1999 due to the re - aluminization of the mirror , which changed the size and/or shape of the psf .",
    "such light curves with a systematic gap are one of the major contaminations in our qso selection .",
    "so we masked the stars , around the bright stars including saturated stars .",
    "saturated stars are not in the star catalogue . to deal with them",
    "we counted the number of continuous pixels , @xmath19 whose adu value is larger than 12,000 on the ogle - ii template image .",
    "then we masked the area centered at these pixels with a radius of @xmath20 .",
    "this removed @xmath21 of variable stars though only @xmath22 of the area in total is masked . at this point , 11,535 light curves still remain .",
    "following @xcite , we use the variogram / structure function ( @xcite , @xcite ) to find objects with increasing variability on longer time - scales .",
    "we measure the slope of the variogram as follows . for all possible pairs of measurements , differences of times , @xmath23 and square of difference of magnitudes ,",
    "@xmath24 are computed . for a given bin of log@xmath25",
    ", the median of @xmath24 is estimated , and is noted as @xmath26 .",
    "this gives a spread of the variation of @xmath6 in this time - scale .",
    "we bin log@xmath25 for three parts divided by 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , then measure the slope , @xmath27 .",
    "the larger @xmath28 , the larger the variability on larger time - scales .",
    "we rejected light curves with @xmath29 , which is a slightly more conservative value than the 0.1 used in @xcite .",
    "we search the periodicity in the light curves by using the aov algorithm ( @xcite ) .",
    "then we reject the light curves in which strong periodicity is detected with the aov periodogram of larger than 50 .",
    "this value was chosen empirically .",
    "we show two sample light curves and @xmath26 as a function of log@xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] . after this procedure ,",
    "3,201 light curves remain .",
    "the remaining light curves , were inspected by eye .",
    "first we rejected apparent periodic and semi - periodic variables which could nt be rejected by the previous procedure .",
    "after this 500 light curves are left .",
    "the main contamination after this selection are high proper motion objects and artifacts around bright variable stars .",
    "we rejected them as follows .",
    "when an object moves from the position at the template image , dia produces a pair of positive and negative residuals on the subtracted image .",
    "the flux of these residuals increases as a function of the displacement of positions of the objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we cross - referenced with the proper motion catalog ( @xcite ) to check if they have high proper motion or if there is a high proper motion object nearby . even if its proper motion is not so high",
    ", a bright nearby star can produces a pair of significant residuals and constantly increase or decrease the brightness of the nearby faint stars . to reject them we looked at the light curves of all neighboring stars in ogle - ii photometric maps within 20 pixels around the object , which were made by using dia .",
    "then we checked whether they have a companion with an opposite ( increasing or decreasing brightness ) light curve around them .    in this process",
    ", we also rejected the light curves which have neighbours with similar light curves .",
    "usually they are affected by nearby bright variable stars but were not masked and not clearly identified in previous procedures because the shape of their light curves are distorted from the original variable due to the combination of the other artifacts or low s / n .",
    "the combination of the effect of the variable star and the high proper motion object resemble the qso light curve .",
    "finally we have 97 qso candidates .",
    "we summarize our selection criteria and the number of remaining candidates after each selection criterion in table [ tbl : select ] .",
    "we show 20 sample light curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] and list them in table  [ tbl : cand ] , where the objects with @xmath30 do nt have @xmath7-band photometry .",
    "the complete list and light curves of all 97 candidates are available in electronic format at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/  sumi / qso - ogleii/. we also show their position on the cmd as open circles in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd ] .    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] , many of our candidates are relatively bright ( @xmath31 ) , which is not expected from a genuine quasar luminosity function .",
    "this means the contamination by irregular variable stars is higher in this range than expected . in this work",
    "we did nt put any cut by their colour , because of the following reasons . for blue objects ,",
    "there are only few candidates with @xmath32 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the be stars which were a major contamination in the previous work ( @xcite ) are above the threshold brightness @xmath33 mag .",
    "for the redder objects , the extinction may be underestimated for background objects because the extinctions are estimated only up to the galactic centre in @xcite .",
    "some objects do nt have @xmath7 photometry .    .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ]        .the number of remaining candidates after each selection criterion .",
    "[ tbl : select ] [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "we have selected 97 qso candidates via variability from ogle - ii dia variable star catalogue in the galactic bulge fields .",
    "finding the qsos in such crowded and high extinction fields is challenging , but should be useful for the astrometric zero - point in these fields and for the study of the foreground dust .",
    "it is especially useful for the study of the bar structure by using the stellar proper motions in these fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "these qsos will also be useful for the future astrometric program , such as space interferometry mission ( sim ) and gaia .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations are required to confirm these qsos .",
    "the multi object and wide field spectrographs , such as vimos / vlt and ldss / magellan , are suitable for this purpose .",
    "we are planning to carry out spectroscopic follow - up observations in 4 of these fields ( bul_sc1 , 2 , 32 and 45 ) by using vimos / vlt .",
    "follow - up observations in other fields are strongly encouraged .    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] , there are more candidates at relatively bright ( @xmath31 ) range , which is not expected from a genuine quasar luminosity function .",
    "this means the contamination by irregular variable stars is higher in this range than the fainter range .",
    "so , the efficiency would be higher in these fainter ( @xmath34 ) candidates .",
    "there are several objects which may be microlensing events , i.e. sc2 - 3191 , sc2 - 4502 , sc14 - 4009 , sc19 - 4350 , sc24 - 3042 , sc30 - 3977 , sc38 - 2298 , and sc39 - 5030 .",
    "we retained these objects because we do not know they are true microlensing or not .",
    "also there are several objects that have light curves too similar to each other to be qsos , i.e. sc4 - 7246 , sc13 - 332 , sc13 - 775 , sc20 - 3616 , sc32 - 1795 sc42 - 3375 , sc42 - 3772 , sc46 - 742 .",
    "they have relatively constant baseline with w or v - shape dent in light curves .",
    "they could be new a type of variable star .",
    "we did not reject them because we do not know what they are .",
    "the current dataset is not optimal to find qsos .",
    "the ogle - ii galactic bulge data are relatively shallower than the ogle - ii magellanic cloud data , which are optimized to find microlensing events .",
    "variable objects were only searched during the first 3 years for some reason .",
    "we can improve the sensitivity by including the 4th year of ogle - ii and ogle - iii to increase the time - scale and the survey area .",
    "the main contamination in this work was artifacts around bright stars or from high proper motion stars rather than be stars as in the previous work ( @xcite ) . because the foreground stars are closer than magellanic clouds , most be stars are above the threshold brightness .",
    "on the other hand , due to much higher stellar density , the artifacts are increased .",
    "the work to avoid such artifacts in the photometry on the subtracted images is underway .",
    "if such a new photometry were to be done , then the efficiency in finding qsos would be increased .",
