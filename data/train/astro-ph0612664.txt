    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic event in the universe .",
    "grbs are generally considered to be powered by hyperaccretion of the matter onto a stellar - mass black hole ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) , which is formed in the context of the `` collapsar '' scenario or merging scenarios of compact objects ( narayan et al .",
    "1992 ; woosley 1993 ; paczynski 1998 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; ruffert & janka 1999 , 2001 ; mszros 2002 ; piran 2005 ) .",
    "the hyperaccretion rate is of the order of @xmath3@xmath4 and the release of gravitational energy powers the burst .",
    "the radiative energy ejected through relativistic jets is expected to account for the observed @xmath5-ray emission .",
    "the key process for releasing the gravitational energy is angular momentum transport in the disk ( lee & ramirez - ruiz 2006 ) . as in the cases of the other astrophysical accretion disks , magnetic turbulence initiated and sustained by the magnetorotational instability ( mri )",
    "is believed to play an essential role for the angular momentum transport in hyperaccretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; lee et al . 2005 ; fujimoto et al .",
    "2006 ; nagataki et al .",
    "2006 ) . detailed linear and nonlinear analysis of the mri",
    "facilitate our understanding the role of the mri in various accretion systems ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 ; machida et al . 2000 ; turner et al . 2002 ; de villiers et al . 2003",
    "; sano et al . 2004 )",
    ". however , the physical conditions of hyperaccretion disks are quite different from the other accretion systems . because the hyperaccretion disks are very dense and hot like supernova cores , they can be cooled through the neutrino radiation ( popham et al .",
    "1999 ; narayan et al . 2001 ; di matteo et al .",
    "in addition , the energy and momentum are mainly transported by neutrinos in the neutrino - opaque region .",
    "however , the detailed analysis of the mri in hyperaccretion disks including such microscopic effects has not been done yet except for araya - gchez & vishniac ( 2004 ) .",
    "masada et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter mss07 ) have investigated the effects of the neutrino transport on the mri in proto - neutron stars ( pnss ) , and shown that the heat , chemical , and viscous diffusions caused by the neutrino transport have great impacts on the mri .",
    "the heat and chemical diffusions can reduce the effect of stratifications , and the neutrino viscosity suppresses the growth of the mri . because the resistivity of hot nuclear matter is relatively low ( yakovlev & shalybkov 1991 ; miralles et al .",
    "2002 ) , the magnetic diffusion is much smaller than the other diffusion processes , and hardly affects the mri inside pnss .",
    "the hyperaccretion disk is considered to have similar physical properties to the pns .",
    "in particular , neutrinos can be trapped in the inner dense region of hyeraccretion disks , and the energy and momentum are mainly transported by the neutrinos .",
    "therefore , we can apply the results of mss07 to hyperaccretion disks with little changes .",
    "the growth time of the mri in the absence of viscosity is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wavelength of a perturbation and @xmath8 is the alfvn speed .",
    "the growth of the mri is suppressed dramatically if the growth time is longer than the viscous damping time @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the kinematic viscosity ( mss07 ) .",
    "then , a large enough viscosity can reduce the linear growth of the mri .",
    "clearly , as the wavelength becomes longer , larger viscosities are required to suppress the mri . because the typical wavelength of the mri is @xmath11 ,",
    "the condition for the linear growth of the mri can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reynolds number , and @xmath14 is the angular velocity . here",
    "we choose @xmath15 as the typical length scale @xmath16 and @xmath17 as the typical velocity @xmath18 .",
    "the reynolds number is a good indicator for rapid growth of the mri in hyperaccretion disks . in the dense neutrino - opaque matter",
    ", the kinematic viscosity via the neutrino transport would be quite large , so that the condition given by equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) may not be satisfied . therefore ,",
    "in this paper , we investigate where the mri operates in hyperaccretion disks focusing on the neutrino viscous effect .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in   2 , we construct reasonable disk models , and derive simple prescriptions for the neutrino opacity and viscosity .",
    "linear growth of the mri in hyperaccretion disks is studied in ",
    "3 using the dispersion equation derived in mss07 . based on the linear stability analysis of the mri ,",
    "we propose a new evolutionary scenario of collapsar disks that can explain the short - term variability in long grbs in   4 . in   5 , we discuss a possible origin of flaring activities in the x - ray afterglow , which have been discovered by the _ swift _ satellite .",
    "finally , we summarize our main findings in   6 .",
    "we need to estimate the amplitude of the kinematic viscosity in hyperaccretion disks to investigate where the mri is active .",
    "the momentum transport by neutrinos plays an important role in the neutrino - opaque regions .",
    "in contrast , its influences can be negligible when the accreting gas is transparent to the neutrino .",
    "we treat , for simplicity , the neutrino transport with the diffusion approximation .",
    "the kinematic viscosity is assumed to be zero in the neutrino - transparent regions .",
    "note that the diffusion approximation fails when the neutrino depth reaches to unity . however , we focus mainly on the qualitative features of the mri in hyperaccretion disks , so that we adopt this simple treatment in this paper .",
    "first we derive the neutrino depth and kinematic viscosity via the neutrino transport .",
    "both absorption and scattering processes of the neutrino contribute to the neutrino depth .",
    "absorption onto the nucleons by the inverse of the urca process gives rise to a large portion of the absorptive neutrino depth .",
    "the other absorptive processes , such as the inverse of pair annihilation , bremsstrahlung , and plasmon decay would be negligible ( kohri & mineshige 2002 ) .",
    "the absorptive neutrino depth is , thus , described by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the temperature , @xmath21 is the density , @xmath22 is the scale height of the disk , and @xmath23 is the mass fraction of free - nucleons ( di matteo et al .",
    "the scattering neutrino depth through elastic scattering of background nucleons is given by @xmath24 , where the factor @xmath25 assumes equivalent contribution for all neutrino species and @xmath26 is the mass scattering coefficient ( tubbs & schramm 1975 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "total neutrino depth @xmath27 is given by the sum of the absorptive and scattering neutrino depth , @xmath28 here @xmath23 can be assumed to be unity in the inner dense region of hyperaccretion disks .",
    "the diffusion approximation for the neutrino transport can be used in the region where the condition @xmath29 is satisfied . in such regions , the averaged mean - free - path of the neutrino",
    "is defined by @xmath30 , and the neutrino viscosity @xmath10 is described by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the neutrino energy density ( van den horn & van weert 1984 ; burrows & lattimer 1988 ) . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the stefan - boltzmann constant and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "spatial distributions of the neutrino depth and viscosity in hyperaccretion disks can be obtained from equations  ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) in so far as the disk structure is determined .",
    "we adopt basic equations based on the newtonian dynamics and assume a quasi - steady structure of hyperaccretion disks .",
    "various steady disk models have been proposed as the central engine of grbs taking into account detailed microphysics and/or general relativity ( popham et al . 1999 ; narayan et al . 2001 ; kohri & mineshige 2002 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ; kohri et al . 2005 ; chen & beloborodov 2007 ; kawanaka & mineshige 2007 ) .",
    "these models are constructed in the framework of the @xmath35-prescription of turbulent viscosity ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "however , we now have an interest in the features of the mri that causes the turbulent viscosity .",
    "it is , thus , necessary to construct disk models independent of the @xmath35-parameter . for simplicity ,",
    "we adopt power - law models for the radial distributions of all physical quantities .",
    "the disk surface density @xmath36 is one of the most important quantities in constructing the disk structure .",
    "we assume a power - law distribution with an index @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distance from the central black hole normalized by the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the schwarzschild radius is given by @xmath40 cm , where @xmath41 is a mass of black hole @xmath42",
    "normalized by 3 @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is a reference value of the surface density at @xmath45 .",
    "when the baryonic matter of its mass @xmath46@xmath47 is distributed within @xmath48 from the central black hole , the averaged surface density is in a range of @xmath49 ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "thus , we choose the reference value as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "another key quantity is the disk temperature , which is assumed to retain a power - law distribution with an index @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a reference value at @xmath45 .",
    "a much less extreme assumption would be that the thermal energy is @xmath55 ",
    "@xmath56 % of the gravitational energy of the disk ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "then the typical disk temperature is estimated as @xmath58 at @xmath45 .",
    "the reference value is chosen as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is another arbitrary parameter .",
    "this temperature is equivalent to the fermi energy of the partially degenerate electrons ( lee et al .",
    "2005 ) .    assuming the disk in which the gas pressure dominates the degenerate and radiation pressure , the sound speed is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath63 is the proton mass . in a gravitationally stable disk , the vertical component of the gravity in the disk",
    "is contributed by the central black hole .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction determines the scale height of the disk , @xmath64 where the disk is assumed to rotate with the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath65 .",
    "then the density structure can be evaluated as @xmath66 using equations ( [ eq5 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) , and ( [ eq8 ] ) , the radial profiles of the neutrino depth and viscosity are given by @xmath67 and @xmath68    the strength of the magnetic field is also an important quantity to determine the growth of the mri in hyperaccretion disks , although it is highly uncertain in the context of grbs .",
    "we assume that the pre - collapse core of a massive star has a uniform magnetic field with the same amplitude as strongly magnetized white dwarfs , that is @xmath69 g and has an average density of @xmath70 .",
    "considering that the magnetic flux is conserved in the core - collapse phase ( @xmath71 ) , the radial structure of the poloidal magnetic field in hyperaccretion disks is obtained as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the arbitrary magnetic parameter . the alfvn speed in the disk is then given by @xmath74    the power - law indexes of the surface density and temperature are determined by the thermal equilibrium in the disk .",
    "there are two main cooling processes in hyperaccretion disks , which are the advection cooling and neutrino one . assuming that the advection cooling dominates the neutrino one , the power - law indexes of the surface density and temperature are given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ; chen & beloborodov 2007 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the adaf ( advection dominated accretion flow ) type disk .",
    "we can also choose the power - law indexes as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , if the neutrino cooling is dominant .",
    "this is so called the ndaf ( neutrino - cooling dominated accretion flow ) type disk , but the neutrino is assumed to be thermal here ( woosley 1993 ) . when the inner dense region is opaque to the neutrino , the disk structure would approach either of these two models . on the other hand , the disk structure may be quite different from them in the neutrino - transparent region ( popham et al .",
    "1999 ; narayan et al .",
    "however , since our main interest is in the neutrino - opaque region , the disk models with single power - law distributions are adopted in this paper .",
    "the linear stability analysis shows that a keplerian disk is gravitationally stable only when toomre s @xmath79 is larger than about unity ( toomre 1964 ; goldreich & lynden - bell 1965 ) . the disk model given by equations  ( [ eq4 ] )  ( [ eq8 ] ) is gravitationally stable when the inequality @xmath80 is fulfilled . since we",
    "are concerned with gravitationally stable disks , we need to choose appropriate values for @xmath81 and @xmath82 satisfying the condition given by equation ( [ eq13 ] ) . assuming the baryonic mass of hyperaccretion disks is @xmath83 , the outermost radius of the disk is about @xmath84 for the adaf - type disk and @xmath85 for the ndaf - type disk .",
    "then , in order that the entire disk is gravitationally stable , these parameters should be @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the adaf - type and ndaf - type disks , respectively .",
    "we consider the evolution of the disks with gravitationally unstable outer regions in   6 .",
    "we evaluate the reynolds number defined by equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) for hyperaccretion disks using equations  ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "the radial profile of the reynolds number is given by @xmath88 the reynolds number is independent of the radius @xmath89 for the adaf models . for the ndaf models , on the other hand , the reynolds number increases as @xmath89 increases .",
    "then the neutrino viscosity is more effective in the inner part of the disks .",
    "the condition that the growth rate of the mri takes of the order of the angular velocity is @xmath90 . for the case of @xmath91 ( our fiducial model )",
    ", it requires that the magnetic field parameter should be @xmath92 .",
    "this indicates that the strong magnetic field more than @xmath93 is necessary for rapid growth of the mri in hyperaccretion disks . when the magnetic field is weaker than this critical value , the inner region of the disk could be a `` dead zone '' where the neutrino viscosity suppresses the mri",
    "to show this picture more concretely , in the following sections , we solve the dispersion equation including the neutrino transport , and derive the maximum growth rate of the mri in hyperaccretion disks .",
    "mss07 derive the dispersion equation for the mri including the effects of the neutrino transport .",
    "we apply it to find out the most unstable modes of the mri in hyperaccretion disks .",
    "the effects of the stratification due to the thermal and leptonic gradients can be ignored in the disk .",
    "we focus on the linear growth rate of the axisymmetric mri .",
    "this is because the axisymmetric mode is the fastest growing mode of the mri , and the stability conditions for the axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric mri are identical ( mss07 ) .",
    "the toroidal component of the field does not affect the linear and nonlinear growth of the mri if the field strength is subthermal ( blaes & balbus 1994 ; sano & stone 2002 ) , so that only the poloidal field is considered in our dispersion equation .",
    "ohmic dissipation would be negligible in hyperaccretion disks .",
    "assuming a uniform vertical field and considering only the damping effect by the neutrino viscosity , the dispersion equation in mss07 can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath95 @xmath96 here @xmath5 is the growth rate , @xmath97 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath10 is the neutrino viscosity , and @xmath98 is the wavenumber .",
    "radial and vertical wavenumbers are described by @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for the keplerian disks , the epicyclic frequency is equal to the angular velocity .",
    "note that the dispersion equation ( [ eq14 ] ) is characterized by a single parameter , which is the reynolds number @xmath101 .",
    "we solve this dispersion equation numerically and show the maximum growth rate of the mri in hyperaccretion disks .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the maximum growth rate of the mri as a function of the disk radius for the cases with different magnetic parameters @xmath102 1 , 10 , 10@xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "upper and lower panels indicate the results for the adaf - type disk ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) and the ndaf - type disk ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , respectively .",
    "the vertical and horizontal axes are normalized by the keplerian angular velocity @xmath105 and the schwarzschild radius @xmath106 . the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath60 are assumed to be unity in this figure ( the fiducial model ) .",
    "the critical radius dividing the neutrino - opaque and neutrino - transparent regions locates at @xmath107 for the adaf - type disk and @xmath108 for the ndaf - type disk .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the mri in the neutrino - opaque region is much smaller than that in the neutrino - transparent region if the magnetic parameter @xmath73 is smaller than @xmath104 .",
    "that is , the mri is strongly suppressed by the neutrino viscosity when the magnetic field is weaker than the critical value , @xmath109 g. turbulent motions at the nonlinear stage can not be sustained when the growth rate of the mri is much less than the angular velocity @xmath14 ( sano & stone 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , mhd turbulence driven by the mri can grow actively in the neutrino - transparent region regardless of the field strength , because the viscosity effect can be neglected there .",
    "the characteristics of the mri in hyperaccretion disks depend on the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath60 .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the mri for the cases with the different disk temperature and surface density are investigated for the two types of disk models in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "normalizations of the vertical and horizontal axes are the same as in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the magnetic parameters @xmath73 is assumed to be unity in these figures .    for the both disk models , it is found that the maximum growth rate of the mri decreases and the size of the dead zone expands with increase of the disk temperature .",
    "this is because the neutrino depth and viscosity increase with the disk temperature [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the decrease of the surface density yields the shrinking of the dead zone and decrease of the maximum growth rate .",
    "the contraction of the dead zone arises from the decrease of the neutrino depth .",
    "the reduction of the maximum growth rate is caused by the rise of the neutrino viscosity with decrease of the surface density .",
    "these results indicate that the dead zones with the size of @xmath110 ",
    "@xmath111 are accompanied with hot and dense hyperaccretion disks ( @xmath112 ) . in what follows",
    ", we develop an evolutionary scenario of hyperaccretion disks with the relatively large size of dead zone .",
    "as is described in the previous section , the mri is suppressed by the neutrino viscosity in the neutrino - opaque region when the magnetic field is weaker than the critical value , @xmath113 .",
    "in contrast , the neutrino - transparent region ( hereafter active region ) is unstable for the mri and its growth rate is of the order of the angular velocity .",
    "these features of the mri in hyperaccretion disks have not been considered in previous work at all . however",
    ", this can be an important physical clue to reveal the central engine of grbs .",
    "the existence of the dead zone could cause episodic hyperaccretion , which can be the source of the short - term variability in the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "we focus on the hyperaccretion disk formed in the context of `` collapsar '' scenario ( woosley 1993 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the central @xmath114 of a massive star collapses directly to a black hole , while infalling material with large specific angular momentum forms an accretion disk of its mass @xmath55  @xmath115 .",
    "we consider a relatively large dead zone ( @xmath116 ) formed at the inner part of a collapsar disk .",
    "in such the case , angular momentum transport in the dead zone would be taken by the neutrino viscosity itself , not by the turbulent viscosity sustained by the mri .",
    "the size of the neutrino viscosity can be described by using the @xmath35-parameter , @xmath117 thus , the @xmath35-value of the dead zone is typically @xmath118 for the fiducial model ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate , @xmath120 , onto the central black hole is given by @xmath121 where the drift velocity is assumed to be @xmath122 and @xmath123 is the mass accretion rate of @xmath124 .",
    "this is the mass of the baryonic matter extracted from the dead zone per unit time .",
    "on the other hand , in the active region , the turbulent viscosity driven by the mri would play an essential role in the angular momentum transport .",
    "it is expected from various nonlinear simulations of the mri that the @xmath35-parameter due to the turbulent viscosity could be @xmath125 or less ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 ; stone et al .",
    "1996 ; sano et al . 2004 ) .",
    "therefore , the mass inflow rate into the dead zone @xmath126 is about @xmath127 this is the mass of the baryonic matter which flows into the dead zone per unit time .    from the equations  ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) ,",
    "it is expected that the baryonic matter is accumulated into the dead zone .",
    "the mass accumulation rate into the dead zone @xmath128 is equivalent to the mass inflow rate , because the extracted mass from the dead zone is negligible ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) .",
    "if the mass accumulation with a rate @xmath130 continues , the inner dead zone becomes gravitationally unstable at some stage .",
    "then the gravitational torque may cause intermittent mass accretion and drive discrete jets , which is thought to be the origin of short - term variability in the prompt emission of grbs ( rees & mszros 1994 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the prospective evolutionary scenario of collapsar disks with dead zones is depicted schematically in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the dead zone region undergoes the quiescent phase and burst phase repeatedly . at the quiescent phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]@xmath131 ) , the neutrino viscosity is the only mechanism of angular momentum transport .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the black hole is relatively small and the mass of the dead zone increases during this phase . when the gravitational instability set in",
    ", the gravitational torque would enhance the accretion rate more than two orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]@xmath132 ) .",
    "the gravitational torque works until the dead zone region becomes gravitationally stable as a result of the intense mass accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "the evolution of accretion disks with the dead zone is also discussed within the paradigm of protoplanetary disks ( nakano 1991 ; jin 1996 ; gammie 1996 ; sano & miyama 1999 ; sano et al .",
    "2000 ; armitage et al .",
    "the origin of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks is the ohmic dissipation . because protoplanetary disks are so cold that the ionization fraction is very low .",
    "the ohmic dissipation of the electric current is efficient enough to suppress the linear growth of the mri . in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss the typical evolutionary timescales and energetics of the episodic accretion in collapsar disks referring to the studies for protoplanetary disks .",
    "we consider an adaf - type disk ( @xmath133 ) described by equations  ( [ eq4])([eq10 ] ) as an example .",
    "then the baryonic mass of the inner dead zone is @xmath134 thus , the most of the baryonic matter is stored in the outer active region at the early evolutionary stage . since toomre s @xmath135 value of the disk is @xmath136 the dead zone region is in the quiescent phase at the beginning .",
    "as time passes , the matter from the outer active region is accumulated near the critical radius .",
    "the gravitational instability begins to grow when the surface density at the critical radius becomes an order of magnitude larger than that of the initial quiescent phase ( i.e. , @xmath137 ) .",
    "once the outer edge of the dead zone becomes gravitationally unstable , spiral waves would be exited globally in the dead zone , and which cause the intense mass accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "the mass accretion rate due to the gravitational torque can be described as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the @xmath35-parameter in gravitationally unstable disks ( e.g. , lodato & rice 2005 ) . the duration of the intense accretion phase should be comparable to the viscous timescale in the dead zone ( armitage et al . 2001 ) ; @xmath140 the gravitational energy released during an intense accretion phase is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the energy conversion efficiency from the rest - mass energy to the gravitational one for the case of kerr black holes ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "after the intense mass accretion phase , the dead zone returns to a gravitationally stable state because of the decrease of the mass in the dead zone region .",
    "however , the mass accretion from the outer active region to the dead zone continues constantly .",
    "the quiescent disk progressively evolves to the intense accretion phase again .",
    "this cycle would be repeated and the explosive energy release occurs intermittently until the baryonic matter of the outer active region is exhausted . finally , the dead zone disk with a low mass accretion rate would be left after the episodic accretion stage ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]@xmath34 ) .    if the episodic accretion is the origin of multiple relativistic shells , which are expected to cause the internal shocks ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ) , the typical variable timescale @xmath143 in the prompt emission of grbs should correspond to the duration of an intense accretion phase : @xmath144 this could be the origin of the observable log - normal feature in the short - term variability of the prompt emission ( nakar & piran 2002 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2002 ; shen & song 2003 ) .",
    "when a few percent of the gravitational energy is converted to the radiative one , the typical luminosity is evaluated as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the conversion factor from the gravitational energy to the radiative one .",
    "these are almost identical to the observed timescale and peak luminosity of variable components in the prompt emission ( norris et al .",
    "1996 ; nakar & piran 2002 ) .    the episodic mass accretion is terminated when the material in the outer active region is exhausted .",
    "then , the total duration of the prompt emission will be determined by the mass depletion timescale . applying the mass inflow rate given by equation  ( [ eq18 ] )",
    ", we can evaluate the total duration and luminosity of the prompt emission as @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the total mass of the accretion disk and is assumed to be 1  2 @xmath150 .",
    "thus , our episodic accretion model of the collapsar disk can explain many observed features of long grbs quantitatively .",

    "2005 ; proga & zhang 2006 ; perna et al .",
    "2006 ) . how can the flaring activities be interpreted in the context of our episodic accretion scenario ?",
    "we consider the case that the outermost region of the collapsar disk is gravitationally unstable , that is , @xmath153 around @xmath84 .",
    "when the disk is gravitationally unstable , it evolves toward the spirally - undulated structure or fragments into bound objects .",

    ", the cooling of @xmath155 photodisintegration can be effective ( piro & pfahl 2006 ; kawanaka & mineshige 2007 ) . the cooling time would be much smaller than the orbital time there .",

    "the mass of a bound fragment is estimated as @xmath156 assuming the coalescence of small fragments into a single body ( piro & pfahl 2006 ) .",
    "considering that the orbital angular momentum of the fragment is mainly extracted in the form of gravitational radiation , its infalling time is typically @xmath157 ( peters 1964 ; piro & pfahl 2006 ) , which agrees with the typical arrival time of the x - ray flares ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; nousek et al .",
    "2005 ; obrien et al .",
    "note that this is much longer than the evolutionary timescale of hyperaccretion disks discussed in the previous section .",
    "as the fragment approaches to the central black hole , it suffers strong tidal force .",
    "then , the bound fragment is disrupted and a rotating disk of its mass @xmath158 is formed around the black hole .",
    "the mass of this newly formed disk ( remnant disk ) is comparable to the mass of the dead zone region [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , the entire region of the remnant disk is magnetorotationally inactive if the field strength is weaker than the critical value , @xmath159 . unlike the early evolutionary stage of the collapsar disk , the episodic accretion can not be expected in the remnant disk .",
    "this is because the baryonic matter does not exist at the outside of the dead zone .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary timescale is determined by the neutrino viscosity ( @xmath160 ) and the mass accretion rate is relatively low , @xmath161 [ c.f . , eq([eq17 ] ) ] .",
    "the duration of the stationary mass accretion would be @xmath162 which is consistent with the observed duration of the x - ray flares ( chincarini et al .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated where the mri operates in hyperaccretion disks focusing on the effect of the neutrino viscosity in order to reveal the energy releasing mechanism of grbs .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows :    \\1 . assuming reasonable disk models and simple neutrino transport , the mri is suppressed by the neutrino viscosity in the inner neutrino - opaque region of hyperaccretion disks when the magnetic field is weaker than the critical value , @xmath163 . on the other hand , in the outer neutrino - transparent region ,",
    "the interaction between the neutrino and baryonic matter can be neglected , and thus the mri can drive mhd turbulence actively .",
    "most of the disk models show that hyperaccretion disks consist of the inner dead zones and outer active regions .",
    "if the mri is suppressed in the dead zone , the baryonic matter accreted from the outer active region should accumulate there .",
    "the mass inflow rate from the active region is estimated as @xmath164 .",
    "then , the inner part of the disk may become gravitationally unstable at some evolutionary stage .",
    "this suggests that intense mass accretion onto the central black hole could be caused episodically by the gravitational torque .",
    "the typical evolutionary timescale of the intense accretion phase corresponds to the viscous timescale of the gravitationally unstable dead zone , and is evaluated as @xmath165 sec . if the episodic release of the gravitational energy is the origin of multiple relativistic shells , the typical variable timescale and peak luminosity in the prompt burst are given by @xmath166 sec and @xmath167 .",
    "these are consistent with the observational features of the short - term variability in grbs .",
    "the total duration of the prompt burst should be determined by the mass depletion timescale of the outer active region , because the episodic mass accretion is terminated when the material in the active region is exhausted . considering a collapsar disk of mass @xmath55  2 @xmath168",
    ", we can evaluate the total duration of the prompt burst as @xmath169 sec .",
    "in addition , the typical luminosity of the prompt burst is obtained as @xmath170 in our episodic accretion model .",
