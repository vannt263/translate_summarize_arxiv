    "nanoalloys are bi- or multi - component metallic particles in the size range between 1 - 100 nm @xcite .",
    "these nanoparticles are of great interest for both basic science and technological applications to magnetism , catalysis and optics .",
    "this wealth of possible applications stem from the very high degree of tunability of the physical and chemical properties of these systems , which is a direct consequence of the great variety of morphologies that nanoalloys can assume .",
    "nanoalloys can present a variety of geometric shapes , ranging from crystalline structures , i.e. fragments of bulk crystals , to non - crystalline structures , the most common being icosahedra , decahedra and polyicosahedra @xcite .",
    "but variety is not limited to the geometric shape , since the atomic arrangement in nanoalloys can form qualitatively different chemical ordering patterns .",
    "chemical ordering patterns can be intermixed ( randomly or phase ordered ) , core - shell and multishell .",
    "also phase separated patterns have been found , such as the so - called as janus particles @xcite , and the ball - and - cup configurations @xcite .",
    "this variety of geometries and patterns reflects the complexity of nanoalloy energy landscapes @xcite , which renders the theoretical prediction of most stable structures quite challenging .",
    "the determination of the most stable structures is the starting point for calculating the properties of nanoalloys , that in general depend both on geometry and on chemical ordering .",
    "the interplay of geometry and chemical ordering is far from trivial , and it is the subject of active investigation .",
    "silver- and gold - containing nanoalloys are presently attracting notable interest .",
    "in particular , the cases of poorly miscible pairs , such as agcu , agco , agni , and auco , have been investigated , both by experiments and simulations , by several groups that have explored a variety of properties and potential applications @xcite .",
    "agco , agni , and auco nanoalloys are studied for their interesting magneto - optical properties which stem from the fact that they are composed by a ferro- ( co or ni ) and a non - ferromagnetic metal ( ag or au ) , the latter presenting a sharp surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) .",
    "the frequency of the spr in these nanoalloys depends on composition and ordering pattern , so that it can be tuned to a good extent @xcite .",
    "applications to catalysis have been also proposed .",
    "for example , agco nanoalloys have been employed in the oxygen reduction in alkaline media @xcite , and agcu clusters are proposed as more efficient catalysts than the corresponding pure clusters for oxygen reduction reactions @xcite .",
    "agcu nanoalloys find application in the fabrication of pb - free solder interconnects , that can melt at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "core - shell au - co nanoparticles have been proposed also for biomedical applications , such as thermal ablation therapies and drug delivery , for which the magnetic co core is coated by a shell of au , which is a biocompatible material that can be easily functionalized @xcite .",
    "all these systems present some common features . besides being poorly miscible in bulk phases @xcite , these systems have the element of larger atomic radius ( ag or au ) presenting smaller cohesive and surface energies than the other element .",
    "these features are all in favour of ag or au surface segregation in these nanoparticles , a behaviour that has been confirmed , both experimentally and computationally , by several studies @xcite . however , the fact that the cluster surface is expected to contain mostly ag or au does not determine completely chemical ordering . as we will see in the following , the latter is strongly influenced by a complex interplay with the nanoparticle geometrical shape .    generally speaking ,",
    "even though several interesting results have been produced , the relation between geometry and chemical ordering in determining the most stable nanoparticle configuration is still to be understood in all these nanoalloys .",
    "in particular , it is still unclear how the geometric shapes influence the preferential chemical ordering . in this paper",
    "we propose a systematic computational investigation of this topic , for agcu , agni , agco , and auco nanoalloys .",
    "we consider ag- or au - rich compositions , that , as we will see , present the most complex and interesting interplay between shapes and patterns . from the computational point of view , most optimization studies about these nanoalloys have treated so far small cluster sizes , below 100 atoms , whose experimental observation at the electron microscope is quite challenging .",
    "there are very few global optimization studies for sizes above 100 atoms for these systems @xcite .",
    "these studies are however focused on a specific structural motif ( the chiral icosahedron ) that is relevant for intermediate and ag- or au - poor compositions . here",
    "we consider clusters of sizes up to more than 10@xmath0 atoms ( diameters up to 3 - 4 nm ) , that can be more easily observed in electron microscopy experiments .",
    "this is especially interesting because techniques such as stem with z - contrast imaging @xcite and energy - filtered tem @xcite allow to reveal the internal structures of binary nanoparticles .",
    "we show that shape and placement of the inner core is clearly correlated with the overall nanoparticle shape , centered cores being possible in icosahedra but not in decahedra and fcc nanocrystals . in icosahedra",
    ", the core is centered until it reaches a critical size at which a morphological instability develops .",
    "finally , we show that multicenter cores are found in polyicosahedra .",
    "from now on , the label s will refer to shell atoms ( i.e. ag or au ) and the label c to core atoms ( cu , ni or co ) .",
    "the nanoparticles are described within an atomistic model developed within the second - moment approximation to the tight - binding model ( smatb potential ) , known also as gupta or rgl potential @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the potential energy of the system depends on the relative distances between atoms @xmath1 and it is written as the sum of single - atom contributions @xmath2 : @xmath3 the parameters @xmath4 depend indeed on the atomic species of the pair only .",
    "therefore @xmath5 can be either @xmath6 or @xmath7 or @xmath8 , and the same holds for all other parameters . as for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the equilibrium distances in the bulk pure crystals at zero temperature , and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is an appropriate cutoff distance so that the sum has contributions from all neighbors of atom @xmath14 that are within @xmath13 . in this work",
    "we choose to put @xmath13 equal to the second - neighbor distance in the respective bulk solids for ss and cc pairs , whereas for sc interactions the cutoff distance is the arithmetic average . the potential is then linked to zero at the third - neighbor distance by a polynomial function in such a way that the resulting function is continuous with continuous derivatives .",
    "the parameters of the potential can be found in @xcite for agcu and agni , in @xcite for agco and in @xcite for auco .",
    "the interaction potential has been favorably checked against density - functional calculations @xcite .",
    "we note that all systems present a considerable lattice mismatch between the metals .",
    "if we measure the mismatch by the quantity @xmath15 we obtain 0.118 for agcu , 0.138 for agni , 0.135 for agco and 0.131 for auco .    in the following",
    "we will calculate the local pressure . for atom @xmath14 ,",
    "the local pressure @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath2 is the atomic energy and @xmath18 is the atomic volume .",
    "@xmath16 is expressed as a function of the atomic coordinates as @xmath19\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the atomic volume in the bulk solid and @xmath20 the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 if @xmath1 is within the second - neighbor distance , by a polynomial link between the second- and third - neighbor distance and zero elsewhere .",
    "the lowest energy structures are searched for by a basin - hopping procedure @xcite with exchange moves only . in an exchange move",
    ", the positions of two atoms of different species are swapped .",
    "the move is followed by local relaxation to reach the closest local minimum . both random and tailored",
    "exchanges are used @xcite . in tailored exchanges ,",
    "atoms are chosen with different probabilities according to their local environment .",
    "usually tailored exchanges allow finding chemical ordering arrangements with lower energy than random exchanges .",
    "random exchanges become not efficient at all when dealing with the nanoparticle sizes considered in this work .",
    "it has been checked however that at smaller size , both random and tailored exchanges lead to the same results , the latter being faster in reaching the lowest - energy structures . for each size and composition ,",
    "at least five independent simulations of 10@xmath24 steps each have been made .",
    "the main geometrical motifs that have been singled out in agcu , agco , agni and auco clusters are fcc nanocrystals , icosahedra , decahedra , and polyicosahedra @xcite .",
    "representative clusters of these geometrical motifs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_geom ] . in the following ,",
    "we consider each geometrical motif and we look for the most energetically stable chemical ordering within that motif , for a series of selected compositions .",
    "our global optimization of the chemical ordering is made by means of the algorithms described in the methods section , within the atomistic potential model whose form and parameters are given there .",

    "it is made of five interpenetrating icosahedra of 147 atoms.,title=\"fig:\",width=415 ]      this motif has been studied in a series of computational works @xcite showing that in agcu , agni and agco the cores assume preferentially off - center positions in clusters in the size range of 2 nm .",
    "this has been recently confirmed experimentally for agcu @xcite in the case of larger nanoparticles , with diameters in the range 5 -10 nm .",
    "as we show in the following , our calculations reproduce this behavior for sizes close to the experimental ones , and for all systems including auco .",
    "we consider specifically a truncated octahedron of 1289 ( diameter @xmath254 nm ) atoms and change the proportion of c atoms , explicitly considering the cases of 1 , 2 , 5 , 20 and 200 c atoms .    for a single c atoms , the most favorable positions are susburface sites in all cases ( see the data reported in table [ tablefcc ] , referring to the impurity sites of fig .",
    "[ fig_to1289_imp ] ) .",
    "this confirms what was already found for agcu and agni fcc clusters by means of atomistic calculations @xcite and for agcu clusters by dft calculations @xcite .",
    "the most favorable position is always the subsurface site below a cluster vertex , with energy gains with respect to central inner sites that vary from a minimum of 0.057 ev for auco to a maximum of 0.170 ev for agco .",
    "surface sites are disfavored compared to subsurface and inner sites , especially in auco .",
    "the energetic cost of bringing an impurity atom from an inner site to the center of a ( 100 ) facet varies from 0.05 ev in agco , to 0.09 ev in agcu , to about 0.15 ev in agni and to more than 0.3 ev in auco .",
    "therefore in agco the energetic cost for placing atoms in the cluster surface is especially small .",
    "this has some important consequences that we will analyze in the following .",

    "the energy in the central position inside the cluster is set to zero in all systems .",
    "subsurface positions are numbered as in fig .",
    "[ fig_to1289_imp ] .",
    "energies are given in ev , local pressures in gpa . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the pentaicosahedron has five icosahedral central sites , that are separated from each other by two sites in between . instead of forming a single aggregate , c atoms begin to populate the different centers , forming very small aggregates , until there are atoms enough to merge in a single connected aggregate . as can be seen in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig_pentaih1 ] , the way by which the different small aggregates merge is system - dependent . in agcu , a non - compact network - like aggregate forms , with cu chains joining the icosahedral centers . in agni and agco , a more compact aggregate of two layers forms , comprising three icosahedral centers , plus two isolated atoms in the remaining icosahedral centers . for 21 c atoms ( second row )",
    "agcu continues the network - like grown sequence , whereas agni and agco form a 20-atom tetrahedron ( comprising four icosahedral centers ) plus an isolated atom in the fifth center .",
    "finally , for 30 c atoms , all systems form the same structure , a single connected aggregate with shape of a double tetrahedron whose five vertices are the icosahedral centers .",
    "increasing the number of c atoms further , the growth sequence for agcu and agni is more symmetric , with a chain of atoms developing around the common basis of the two tetrahedra forming the double tetrahedron . for agco ,",
    "the structures are less symmetric . however , in all cases , small 13-atom icosahedra of the c species form around the icosahedral centers .",
    "finally , for 96 c atoms the growth sequence is completed by a cluster which preserves the symmetry of the original pentaicosahedron . around each icosahedral center",
    "there is a small 13-atom icosahedron of c atoms .",
    "this last structure is stable also for auco .",
    "the growth sequences of the cores can be understood by considering site energies of single impurities and their local pressures , as reported in table [ tablepenta ] , which refers to the sites shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_penta_num ] .",
    "the five icosahedral are by far the preferred sites .",
    "c atoms in these sites present a positive pressure , which is however by far smaller than the pressure that would act on an ag atom in the same sites . therefore , as in simple icosahedra , placing the impurity in a icosahedral center causes a notable strain release and the stabilization of the structure .",
    "the second - best sites for a single impurity are then those on the segments joining the icosahedral centers .",
    "this is the driving force towards the formation of network - like aggregates .",
    "this driving force is counterbalanced by the tendency to form compact aggregates , which originates from the fact that the c - c bonds are the strongest ones . in agco and agni , where c - c bonds are by far stronger ,",
    "the tendency towards more compact structures prevails . in agcu , c - c bonds are less strong , therefore the driving force towards the network - like structures prevails up to about 20 cu atoms .",
    "we note that low absolute values of the local pressures are well correlated with favorable site energies .",
    "our results clearly show that the optimal shape and placement of the core in core - shell nanoparticles are strictly correlated to the overall geometry of the nanoparticle itself .",
    "however some common features of general character can be singled out .",
    "the first point is that off - center asymmetric cores are the rule as lowest - energy structures , not the exception .",
    "in fact , we have seen that these cores are dominant in crystalline and decahedral motifs .",
    "centered cores can be obtained in icosahedral nanoparticles , but only for core sizes that are not too large .",
    "in fact , our calculations show that there is a critical size for the onset of a morphological instability which drives the core to an asymmetric shape extending towards the nanoparticle surface . in polyicosahedral nanoparticles ( and to a much lesser extent in decahedra ) , multi - center core structures are possible . even in these cases",
    "the cores are often not symmetrically placed with respect to the center of the whole structure .    in all cases",
    "in which off - center cores are prevailing , centered cores are still possible as metastable configurations , whose lifetime can drastically change depending on temperature .    the physical factors causing the asymmetric placement of the cores and the onset of the morphological instability of the cores in icosahedra originate from very simple features of generic character , essentially from the strain originated from lattice mismatch .",
    "the morphological instability of icosahedral cores bears some analogy with a very general phenomenon taking place in thin film heteroepitaxial growth , i.e. the stranski - krastanov instability . for this reason , we believe that the same effects should appear in a whole class of nanoparticles sharing the same features , i.e. poor miscibility , lattice mismatch and tendency of bigger atoms to segregate to the surface .",
    "for example , systems as auni , aurh and aupt are expected to present this kind of behavior .    even though our calculations are finding low - energy structures and therefore are related to the low - temperature behavior of the systems , we believe that the asymmetric cores should be present also in a significant temperature range .",
    "in fact , energy differences between centered cores and off - center cores become readily very large , so that we expect that the effect of temperature may change the details of the core shape , however without changing its qualitative features . on the other hand ,",
    "the melting behavior of icosahedra with small centered cores compared to the melting of icosahedra with larger off - center cores is an interesting subject which deserves investigation .",
    "also the magnetic properties in co- or ni - containing nanoparticles with off - center cores can be of interest .",
    "finally we note that our results are relevant to the design of experimental procedures to achieve effective coatings of the cores in systems in which lattice mismatch is present .",
    "our results show indeed that achieving effective coatings may be a quite difficult task .",
    "in fact , in the lowest energy configuration , the core very often tends to approach the nanoparticle surface , so that part of the core itself is covered by a very thin layer of shell atoms .",
    "a few core atoms may even appear at the cluster surface in some cases .",
    "centered cores can be experimentally grown , but these are metastable structures , which therefore may present aging problems due to this driving force towards more asymmetric shapes .",
