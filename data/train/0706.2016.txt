    ". the northeastern outflow of a2 has an intriguing bent feature that was interpreted as a result of collision between the outflow and a dense cloud core ( choi 2005 ) .",

    "the ngc 1333 iras 4 region was observed using the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory in the @xmath4 transition of h@xmath0o  ( 22.235077 mhz ) .",
    "the observations were made in two tracks in the a - array configuration .",
    "twenty - two antennas were used on 2006 march 24 , and twenty - three antennas were used on 2006 april 24 .",
    "the spectral windows were set to have 128 channels with a channel width of 0.024 mhz , giving a velocity resolution of 0.33 .",
    "the phase and bandpass calibrator was the quasar 0336 + 323 ( 4c 32.14 ) .",
    "the flux calibration was done by observing the quasar 0713 + 438 ( qso b0710 + 439 ) .",
    "the flux density of 0713 + 438 was 0.47 jy in march and 0.44 jy in april , which are the flux densities measured within a day of our observations ( vla calibrator flux density database ) .",
    "comparison of the amplitude gave a flux density of 1.00 jy in march and 0.92 jy in april for 0336 + 323 , which agrees with the value in the vla calibrator flux density database to within 9% and 2% , respectively . to avoid the degradation of sensitivity owing to pointing errors ,",
    "pointing was referenced by observing the calibrators in the @xmath5-band ( 3.6 cm ) .",
    "this referenced pointing was performed at the beginning of each track and just before observing the flux calibrator .",
    "the phase tracking center was @xmath6 = 03@xmath729@xmath810529 and @xmath9 = 3113@xmath1031000 .",

    "the maps have rms noises of 2.4 and 2.5 mjy beam@xmath14 , respectively .",

    "the continuum emission was not detected .",
    "figure 1 shows the known compact sources in our field of view .",
    "eight maser spots were detected around iras 4a2 , and four spots were detected near iras 4bi .",
    "all the a2 masers are redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the cloud core ( @xmath15 = 6.7 ; blake et al .",
    "1995 ; choi 2001 ) . out of the four maser spots near bi , two spots are redshifted and the others are blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the cloud core ( @xmath15 = 6.6 ; blake et al .",
    "we examined the whole field of view , but no maser source was detected around h@xmath0o(c ) .",
    "table 1 lists the source parameters , and figures 2 and 3 show the distribution of the detected h@xmath0o  maser spots .",
    "spectra of the h@xmath0o  masers are shown in figure 4 .",
    "out of the twelve h@xmath0o  maser spots detected , eight are associated with iras 4a2 , and four with iras 4bi .",
    "previous observations with vla also showed several h@xmath0o  maser spots .",
    "bi masers were detected by both rodrguez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and furuya et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and a2 masers were detected by furuya et al .",
    "( 2003 ) only .",
    "six maser spots , pc 25 , 7 , and 8 , are located near the radio continuum source a2 , within 100 au .",
    "the maser velocity ranges from 7.2 to 8.8 , and the maser lines are near the systemic velocity ( 6.7 ; blake et al .",
    "1995 ; choi 2001 ) , within about 2 .",
    "the tight positional association with the continuum source and the small velocity differences suggest that these maser spots may be related with the circumstellar disk , not the outflow .",
    "these maser emission probably comes from shocked gas in the accretion disk .",
    "the exact nature of the shock is not clear .",
    "there are other examples of h@xmath0o  masers that are probably emitted by the shocked gas in protostellar disks , including iras 00338 + 6312 , ic 1396n , and ngc 2071 irs 1/3 ( fiebig et al . 1996 ; slysh et al . 1999",
    "; seth et al . 2002 ) .",
    "pc 3 and 5 in march are identical to pc 7 and 8 in april , respectively , in both position and velocity ( table 1 ) .",
    "these two spots seem to have a relatively long lifetime , at least a month . since the maser line detected by furuya et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have different velocities , the lifetime is shorter than a few years .      no maser spot associated with a1 was detected , which probably indicate that the a2 disk is more active than the a1 disk .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the facts that a2 drives more powerful outflow than a1 and that the a2 disk is brighter in nh@xmath3 lines than the a1 disk ( choi 2005 ; choi et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the systemic velocity of the bi cloud core is @xmath16.6 ( blake et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the maser velocity ranges from @xmath16 to 19.9 ( rodrguez et al . 2002 ; this work ) .",
    "the maser spots lie along a 07long straight line in the southeast - northwest direction , p.a .",
    "@xmath17 ( fig .",
    "the hcn outflow observed by choi ( 2001 ) flows in a similar direction .",
    "these facts suggest that the bi masers are emitted from the shocked gas related with the outflow .",
    "figure 5 shows the position ",
    "velocity diagram , which shows that the blueshifted masers tend to be located in the southeast direction , while the redshifted ones in the northwest .",
    "this trend agrees with the hcn outflow .",
    "torrelles et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) claimed that h@xmath0o  masers often prefer to trace selectively either the disk or the outflow in a specific region and proposed that this dichotomy may be caused by the differences in the evolutionary stage of the driving source .",
    "they suggested that the h@xmath0o  maser traces the disk in younger sources and the outflow in older sources .",
    "our observations appear to show that such a dichotomy may exist in the ngc 1333 iras 4 region .",
    "most of the a2 masers trace the disk , while the bi masers trace the outflow . however , the measured outflow timescales suggest that a2 ( @xmath12000 yr ; choi et al .",
    "2006 ) is much older than bi ( @xmath1120 yr ; choi 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary explanation of the dichotomy by torrelles et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) does not seem to hold .",
    "then what could cause the apparent dichotomy ?",
    "a possible explanation can simply be the low occurrence rate of the maser phenomenon .",
    "the h@xmath0o  line amplification requires the existence of warm high - density shocked gas ( elitzur 1995 ) , and h@xmath0o  maser in low - mass ysos is a rare phenomenon .",
    "previous surveys of h@xmath0o  masers toward low - mass ysos showed that the detection rate is typically 520 % ( wilking & claussen 1987 ; terebey et al .",
    "1992 ; persi et al .",
    "1994 ; furuya et al . 2003 ; gmez et al .",
    "since the detection probability of either disk - maser or outflow - maser is small , the probability of detecting both disk- and outflow - masers around a single yso would be even smaller .",
    "for example , let us assume that the detection probability of h@xmath0o  maser from a disk is 10 % , and that the probability is similar for an outflow .",
    "if the two kinds of maser occur independently , the probability of detecting both in a specific region would be only @xmath11 % .",
    "that is , in this example , out of all the regions associated with masers , 95 % of the sample would show only one kind of masers , either disk - maser or outflow - maser , not both .",
    "therefore , the dichotomy could be a result of low probability .",
    "the maser source h@xmath0o(c ) reported by haschick et al .",
    "( 1980 ) was not detected in any of the observations with vla ( rodrguez et al . 2002 ; furuya et al .",
    "2003 ; this work ) .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the nondetection .",
    "first , all the vla observations might be unfortunately made during inactive phases of h@xmath0o(c ) .",
    "second , h@xmath0o(c ) might be a mis - identification of a2 .",
    "haschick et al .",
    "( 1980 ) observed using a single - dish telescope with a large beam size .",
    "the right ascension of h@xmath0o(c ) coincides with that of a2 , and the declination of h@xmath0o(c ) could be in error .",
