    "@xcite such kind of amplification was demonstrated .",
    "here , the dynamics is as follows : one mode induces rabi oscillations in the qubit and , when the frequency of these oscillations is adjusted to the second signal frequency , resonant interaction can result in amplification or damping of the latter signal .",

    "it would be necessary to either include more levels of the dressed ladder or to add corrections to the energy levels in one manifold ( on one stair of the dressed ladder ) introduced by the stairs above and below .",
    "our experimental results show , that in the strong driving limit levels of different photon numbers are strongly coupled and yield corrections to the level splitting of the rabi levels .",
    "furthermore , due to the strong mixing of the levels in the high driving case , resonance conditions can be defined between each adjacent pair of levels .",
    "we have considered the situation when a two - level system ( qubit ) is coupled to two quantum oscillators .",
    "the emphasis was made on the specific solid - state realization of a flux qubit coupled to a transmission - line resonator , which is driven close to a harmonic and probed at the fundamental frequency .",
    "the former driving signal is not directly observable and was included into the considerations by the qubit s dressed states .",
    "similarly , the interaction of the dressed qubit with the resonator s fundamental mode can be considered as the second dressing of the qubit s dressed states . when the energy of the probing photons matches the dressed energy levels , a resonant energy exchange results in either the amplification or attenuation of the probing signal , depending on the tunable relaxation rates .",
    "we have presented a detailed theoretical description of those processes , as well as related the results to other studies , such as refs .",
    "[ ] . our theoretical findings together with the experimental results , presented here and in ref .",
    "[ ] , are useful for the description of the qubit - resonator systems in terms of the dressed states .",
    "especially since the high quality of the resonator together with the rather weak coupling between the resonator and the qubit prevent the energy levels from smearing out . in other words , although the driving signal is strong , the added decoherence is still small , so that sharp resonance conditions were observed .",
    "furthermore , the idea of transferring energy from one resonator s mode to another via a single qubit may be useful for further applications .",
