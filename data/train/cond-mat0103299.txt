    "since the first experimental achievement of bose - einstein condensates in atomic gases in 1995 , many properties of these systems have been studied experimentally and theoretically , and particularly the existence of vortices @xcite . a way to create vortices consists in rotating the trap confining the atoms : for sufficiently large velocities , it becomes energetically favorable to have vortices in the system .",
    "theoretical studies of this type of experiments have often been made in the framework of the nonlinear schrdinger equation or gross - pitaevskii equation , well known for superfluids , but which provides a very good description of bose - einstein condensates : it is assumed that the @xmath2 particles of the gas are condensed in the same state for which the wave function @xmath3 minimizes the gross - pitaevskii energy . by introducing a rotating frame at the angular velocity @xmath4 ,",
    "the trapping potential becomes time independent , and the wave function @xmath3 minimizes the energy @xmath5 under the constraint @xmath6 . here , for any complex quantities",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 and their complex conjugates @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 . the terms in the energy correspond to the kinetic energy , the trapping potential energy , the interaction energy and the inertial due to the change of frame .",
    "when the atoms are strongly confined in the @xmath12axis , the situation can be simplified to a two dimensional problem where the wave function @xmath13 depends only on @xmath14 and it minimizes @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the constraint @xmath17 is also imposed .",
    "our study was at first motivated by the work of castin and dum @xcite who have studied the equilibrium configurations by looking for the minimizers in a reduced class of functions for the 2d case and have done numerical computations in 2 and 3d .",
    "their analysis is in the thomas - fermi regime , where the mean interaction energy per particle is larger than @xmath18 .",
    "our aim is to provide a mathematical framework for a rigorous study of the energy @xmath19 and its minimizers in the thomas fermi limit .",
    "we first observe that this energy has a striking similarity with the high - kappa , high - field limit of the ginzburg - landau free energy used in the modeling of superconductors .",
    "thus , we expect the energy @xmath20 will develop similar behavior as those for the ginzburg - landau energy studied in @xcite . in particular , the results obtained in the context of ginzburg - landau energy may be applied to @xmath21 , in the thomas fermi regime , to yield an asymptotic development of the energy as well as the critical velocities for the nucleation of vortices and the location of these vortices . due to the close resemblance",
    ", we will not be concerned with the detailed derivations in this paper , but rather focus on the conclusions one can draw from the asymptotic developments . to our knowledge , some of our estimates to be presented later have not been given in the literature previously .",
    "let us point out that our method to compute the energy is also new in this context and very different from the ones in , for instance , @xcite .",
    "we define the characteristic length @xmath22 and set @xmath23 in the thomas - fermi approximation , @xmath1 is small , which will be our asymptotic regime .",
    "we re - scale the distance by @xmath24 and define @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "assume that @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 and we set @xmath30 .",
    "since the trapping potential is stronger than the inertial potential , we have @xmath31 .",
    "the energy can be rewritten as : @xmath32 due to the constraint @xmath33 , we can add to @xmath34 any multiple of @xmath35 where @xmath36 for some constant @xmath37 to be determined .",
    "let @xmath38 be the ellipse @xmath39 .",
    "we impose the following constraint on @xmath37 : [ cons]_a(*r*)=1.indeed , as @xmath1 tends to 0 , the minimizer will satisfy that @xmath40 will be close to @xmath41 so that the constraint will be satisfied automatically by @xmath7 if we impose ( [ cons ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ cons ] ) leads to @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , that is @xmath44 , then @xmath38 is a disc of radius @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "to study the problem analytically , it is reasonable to minimize the energy over the domain @xmath38 with zero boundary data for @xmath7 . indeed , when @xmath47 , the energy is convex so that the minimizer @xmath7 goes to zero exponentially at infinity ( see the numerical observation in @xcite and the analysis on the behavior near the boundary of @xmath38 as well as the decay at infinity of the order parameter in @xcite ) .",
    "denote @xmath48 the space of square integrable functions defined on the domain @xmath38 that have square integrable derivatives up to the order @xmath49 , and @xmath50 the space of functions in @xmath51 satisfying the zero boundary condition .",
    "denote the norm @xmath52 by @xmath53 for any square integrable function @xmath8 , we then consider the problem @xmath54 where @xmath55 note that critical point @xmath7 of @xmath56 is a solution of [ eqbe ] -u-2i().u=1 ^ 2u(a-|u|^2)+_u , with @xmath57 on @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the lagrange multiplier . the specific choice of @xmath37 in ( [ cons ] ) will imply that the term @xmath60 is negligible in front of @xmath61 .",
    "we want to study the behavior of @xmath62 as @xmath1 goes to 0 . in section 2 ,",
    "we compute an asymptotic development of the energy and in section 3 , the critical velocities of nucleation of vortices and the location of the vortices . in section 4",
    ", we study the evolution in imaginary time and construct some numerical algorithms . in section 5 , we present some computational results and the energy diagrams .",
    "to study the behavior of the minimizer of the energy when @xmath1 goes to zero , we observe that the form of the energy ( [ be ] ) is close to the ginzburg - landau functional studied in @xcite , @xcite where the magnetic field has been replaced by a rotating term and similar to @xcite except for the trapping potential and the minimization over constraint .",
    "the main idea is to decouple the energy into three terms : a part coming from the solution without vortices , a vortex contribution and a term due to rotation .",
    "the estimate on the vortex contribution was developed in @xcite .",
    "firstly , we are interested in solutions without vortices , that is @xmath7 has no zero in the interior of @xmath38 .",
    "thus we consider functions of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is in @xmath65 and @xmath66 is real and has no zero in the interior of @xmath38 .",
    "we consider first minimizing @xmath56 over such functions without imposing the constraint that the @xmath67 norm is 1 , that is , @xmath66 and @xmath68 minimize @xmath69 we have @xmath70 on @xmath58 and [ f ] -f+fs(s-2)=1 ^ 2f(a - f^2 ) , [ s ] ( f^2(s-))=0.equation ( [ s ] ) implies that there exists @xmath71 in @xmath72 such that [ xinp ] f^2(s-)= , where @xmath73 .",
    "so @xmath71 is the unique solution of [ xieq ] ( 1f^2 ) = 0 , = 0 .",
    "note that equation ( [ xinp ] ) is the equation for the velocity , but we prefer to write it as an orthogonal gradient for our later purposes of integration by part . in the special case where @xmath38 is a disc , the minimum of ( [ fsener ] ) is reached for @xmath74 but this is not the case if @xmath38 is an ellipse and there is a non trivial solution of ( [ s ] ) .",
    "[ [ the - case - of - the - disc ] ] the case of the disc + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    assume that @xmath75 so that @xmath38 is a disc and @xmath76 .",
    "as discussed earlier , @xmath74 in this case so that the energy becomes [ enerreal ] e_(f)= _ |f |^2 + 12 ^ 2(a ( r)-f^2)^2 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the minimizer of ( [ enerreal ] ) over real valued functions in @xmath50 .",
    "then , @xmath77 has no vortex , is independent of @xmath78 and satisfies @xmath79 when @xmath1 tends to 0 , @xmath80 is close to @xmath41 except on a boundary layer of size @xmath81 close to @xmath58 .",
    "more precisely , using sub and super solutions , one can verify that @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , one can construct a sub solution of the type above in any region @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "then the value of @xmath86 is less than @xmath87 .",
    "the boundary layer can be analyzed using the change of variable @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "then @xmath90 satisfies the painlev equation @xmath91 the boundary behavior has already been studied in @xcite and @xcite , but using matched asymptotics .",

    "@xmath94 tends to @xmath41 in every compact subset of @xmath38 and the function @xmath95 given by ( [ xinp ] ) or ( [ xieq ] ) tends to the unique solution @xmath71 of [ xilim ] ( 1a)=0 , = 0 .",
    "one can easily get that @xmath96 . using ( [ xinp ] ) , we can define @xmath97 , the limit of @xmath98 , to be the solution of @xmath99 with zero value at the origin .",

    "since @xmath77 satisfies the gross pitaevskii equation ( [ f])-([s ] ) , we have @xmath106 using this identity , one can get that the energy @xmath107 decouples as follows @xmath108 where @xmath109 this decoupling was used in @xcite in the case of a disc where @xmath110 .",
    "we now estimate the terms in ( [ splitener ] ) .",
    "the first term @xmath111 is a constant only depending on @xmath1 , and not on the solution type , that is with or without vortices .",
    "the second term gives a contribution coming from the vortices and the third term is due to the vortices and rotation .",

    "moreover , the degree @xmath121 is not zero and there is an estimate of the energy of @xmath90 in each ball @xmath122 .",
    "this analysis means that vortices are in fact defined in the balls where @xmath90 is less than @xmath123 and has a non zero degree .",
    "this allows us to compute @xmath124 for which only the gradient term in the vortex balls will give a contribution : each vortex gives a contribution in the amount of @xmath125 due to its degree and a contribution of lower order which comes from the interaction with the other vortices .",
    "moreover , @xmath126 is almost @xmath41 : @xmath127 in order to estimate the third term in ( [ splitener ] ) we let @xmath128 be the solution of @xmath129 which is zero on the boundary of @xmath130 .",

    "they also have @xmath159 for the case @xmath75 .",

    "the proof consists in constructing a test function with a vortex at the origin and computing the energy of this test function .",
