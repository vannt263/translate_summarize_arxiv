    "nuclear reactions induced by electromagnetic probes are well known to represent a powerful tool to investigate the properties of nuclear structure , because the whole target volume can be explored and the electromagnetic interaction with the external probe is well described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite .    in the case of electron scattering ,",
    "the additional ability of independently varying energy and momentum transferred to the target , as well as high - quality beams with large duty factors delivered by modern electron accelerators , allows for a detailed mapping of the nuclear response over very different kinematical conditions  @xcite .",
    "the power of this tool can be better exploited by requiring exclusive measurements like in the case of @xmath1 reactions , where the proton is detected in coincidence with the final electron and , when possible , for a specific energy range corresponding to a well - defined quantum state of the residual nucleus .",
    "the richness of the structure of the theoretical cross section indicates that under suitable kinematical conditions it is possible to disentangle observables which are selectively sensitive to certain ingredients of the theoretical model  @xcite .    additionally , if polarization observables can be measured , it is in principle possible to determine all the independent scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "however , this experimentally formidable goal is far from being achieved . more simply , if just the electron beam is polarized , it is possible to isolate the socalled fifth structure function , which is generated by the interference between two or more reaction channels with different competing phases  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the corresponding cross section asymmetry with respect to electron helicity can be used to explore the interfering reaction amplitudes , most of which are usually very small and otherwise hidden in the unpolarized case  @xcite . in electroproduction of pions",
    "the fifth structure function may provide a key observable for the isolation of the resonating channel in the @xmath2 transition , corresponding to a quadrupole deformed excitation of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "also in inclusive electron scattering from polarized targets the helicity asymmetry is needed to access observables like the neutron form factor  @xcite or the spin - dependent nucleon structure functions  @xcite .    here , the completely exclusive quasielastic @xmath4 reaction on nuclear targets will be considered . the fifth structure function",
    "is then given by the interference between the direct knockout and the rescattering channels and is therefore highly sensitive to final state interactions ( fsi ) between the outgoing proton and the residual nucleus .",
    "this issue has become crucial at the new ( cebaf ) and planned ( elfe  @xcite ) high - energy electron accelerators , where experiments with electromagnetic probes at momentum transfer beyond 1 gev/@xmath5 ( in particular @xmath1 reactions  @xcite ) are expected to shed some light on exotic phenomena predicted by the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , such as for example the color transparency ( ct ) .",
    "in fact , the experimental signal is predicted to be very small in this energy domain and a reliable model for fsi is needed to verify the ct prediction  @xcite .    in the present literature",
    "the most popular and widely adopted approach is the glauber method  @xcite , which has a long well - established tradition of successfull results in the field of high - energy proton - nucleus elastic scattering  @xcite . despite the high energy regime",
    "to which it is applied , this method is developed in a completely nonrelativistic formalism within the eikonal approximation . because for a fastly moving object the nuclear density can be considered roughly constant inside all the nuclear volume but the small part corresponding to the surface , the eikonal wave function of the ejectile can be approximated by a damped plane wave , which corresponds to the solution of a schrdinger equation inside homogeneous nuclear matter .",
    "in fact , in a previous paper  @xcite the angular distribution of emitted protons with outgoing energy beyond the inelastic threshold and with initially bound momentum below the fermi surface has been shown to be well reproduced by actually assuming a plane wave for the final nucleon state with an additional damping .",
    "therefore , in the following the scattering wave function will be represented as a plane wave with a complex wave vector , whose imaginary part produces a constant damping .",
    "consequently , in the framework of the distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) at the one - photon exchange level analytical formulae can be derived for all the components of the nuclear response . moreover",
    ", the presence of a damping in the outgoing plane wave produces a fsi effect of purely geometrical nature and generates an asymmetry of the cross section with respect to the helicity of the electron beam .    after a short review on the general formalism ( sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] ) , analytical formulae for the fifth structure function and the helicity asymmetry will be deduced in sec .",

[ fig1 ] ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the momentum and energy transferred to the target nucleus , respectively .",

    "the tensor @xmath15 depends only on the properties of the electromagnetic vertex and its components are completely determined by qed  @xcite .",

    "the cancellations between contributions of the same order in powers of @xmath127 are very sensitive to the relativistic corrections to the current operator and produce a nontrivial scaling law . assuming that for large @xmath126 the bjorken variable @xmath134 is approximately constant and , consequently , @xmath135 , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : diracff ] ) , ( [ eq : nospfl ] ) , ( [ eq : spfl ] ) and ( [ eq : denom ] ) it can be deduced that the helicity asymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymmanal ] ) scales as    @xmath136    in the energy domain pertinent to the planned elfe setup  @xcite , the previous assumptions on @xmath137 do not hold yet .",
    "a different tail as power of @xmath127 must be expected for @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , in fig",
    ".  [ fig5 ] the helicity asymmetry is shown , multiplied by @xmath138 , as a function of @xmath117 for the same reaction and in the same kinematical conditions as in the previous figure .",
    "the plateau indicates that in this energy window the scaling is different from what is predicted by eq .",

    "( [ eq : curr ] ) ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "finally , since the kinematics is here purely transverse and for high @xmath139 the longitudinal component of the missing momentum , @xmath140 , is anyway small , the asymmetry is approximately linearly dependent on @xmath77 ( @xmath141 ) and , consequently , does not show any interesting structure with respect to @xmath140 .",
    "the @xmath142 reaction has been analyzed assuming for the scattering state a plane wave with complex wave vector .",
    "this choice allows for obtaining analytical formulae for the different components of the nuclear response ; it corresponds to the situation where the outgoing proton emerges as a free particle but its wave function is exponentially damped with a rate related to the imaginary part @xmath63 of the complex wave vector .",
    "this picture is also equivalent to solve the problem for the scattering state in the lowest - order eikonal approximation or , alternatively , to compute the fsi of the outgoing proton travelling across absorbitive homogeneous nuclear matter represented by a complex potential .",
    "in fact , @xmath63 has been shown to be directly related to the imaginary part of this potential and is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "since the residual nucleus is left with quantum numbers @xmath143 , there are no fsi due to spin - orbit effects .",
    "the modification of the emerging plane wave is the only reason why the symmetry between protons emitted above and below the scattering plane is broken .",
    "the different path followed on the way out of the nucleus makes them have different rescatterings with the residual and , consequently , produces a phase difference with respect to the channel where they are knocked out directly as free particles . in these conditions , and in general whenever there are at least two predominant reaction channels with different phases  @xcite , the cross section part depending on the electron helicity @xmath6 does not vanish .    in particular , the fifth structure function @xmath0 can be used to disentangle interfering processes and , in the present case of quasielastic kinematics , to study the rescattering amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath0 has been analyzed for the previously mentioned reaction in purely transverse kinematics for the energy range above the inelastic threshold ( @xmath144 gev/@xmath5 ) , where the fsi are almost purely absorbitive and the eikonal approximation is known to be reliable  @xcite .",
    "inspection of the analytical formula shows that dramatic cancellations take place among the different contributions coming from the ( non ) spin - flipping parts of the interaction current . as a result ,",
    "the absolute size of @xmath0 is very small and , presumably , hardly observable .",
    "however , the asymmetry between particles detected above and below the scattering plane is equivalent to the asymmetry for particles emitted in the same direction but for opposite @xmath6 .",
    "the helicity dependent cross section @xmath13 , proportional to @xmath0 , can be singled out by making coincidence measurements with a fixed spectrometer at an angle out of scattering plane and flipping the helicity of the incoming polarized electron .",
    "high precision data can be obtained with this asymmetry technique , because most systematic errors cancel in the ratio  @xcite .",
    "the analytical formula for the helicity asymmetry @xmath37 has been studied in the same previous kinematics , specifically focussing on its asymptotic behaviour for very large energy and momentum transfer .",
    "in fact , despite of its very small absolute size , it shows an interesting structure with a change of sign and a long asymptotic tail .",
    "the occurrence inside @xmath0 of cancellations between competing contributions , asymptotically scaling with the same power of @xmath127 , is very sensitive to higher - order relativistic corrections to the current operator and produces in the related @xmath37 a nontrivial scaling law for large @xmath84 , which can not be naively deduced from dimensional arguments applied to the elementary photo - quark reaction amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this asymptotic scaling occurs for very large values of @xmath84 outside the range available to the operational or planned setups of modern electron accelerators , such as cebaf or elfe .",
    "in particular , in the energy domain of the latter  @xcite the asymmetry @xmath37 still shows a scaling behaviour , but with a power law in @xmath127 which is different from the asymptotic one .    in summary , within the present nonrelativistic reduction of the current operator at the order described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : curr ] ) , the helicity asymmetry is very small in its absolute size but shows a long nontrivial tail for large @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath145 it scales as @xmath146 , but it approaches the asymptotic regime very slowly , even locally showing , for large but finite @xmath84 , different scaling behaviours .                      where @xmath152 is a integration path on the complex plane , extending to @xmath153 on the real axis but going through the point @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is an analytical complex function with the property @xmath156 for @xmath157 if @xmath152 is closed in the upper ( lower ) part of the complex plane .        which generalizes the standard relationship between the @xmath53 and the plane wave through the fourier transformation .",
