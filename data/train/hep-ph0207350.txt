    "the standard model ( sm ) provides an elegant minimal framework for studying neutrino physics . in this framework , neutrinos are produced and detected , and interact with matter during propagation , through charged and neutral current renormalizable interactions . at the same time , the mixing with charged leptons and the ( small ) masses can be accounted for by non - renormalizable interactions in the form @xmath4 .",
    "whatever is the ultraviolet completion of the sm , it would be no surprise if the direct and indirect signals looked for at colliders and low - energy experiments were accompanied by effects in neutrino experiments .",
    "indeed , such effects may arise at a significant level e.g.  in supersymmetric  @xcite or extra - dimensional  @xcite new physics scenarios .",
    "the possibility that new physics ( np ) affects the neutrino transitions observed in solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , lsnd  @xcite , and supernova  @xcite experiments has been widely studied in the literature .",
    "here we consider , from a model independent point of view , the possibility of measurable effects in a high intensity controlled neutrino experiment .",
    "as in all other cases , np can give rise to corrections to the production or detection interaction  @xcite , as well as to the interaction with matter during propagation  @xcite . here",
    "we are interested in the latter possibility .",
    "effects in the production and detection processes may also play a role , although not necessarily .",
    "however , the features of the two types of effects are quite different , which should make relatively easy to disentangle them .",
    "in fact , due to the geometrical @xmath5 suppression , the latter are best studied at a smaller baseline @xmath6  @xcite , whereas in the former case the @xmath5 suppression is compensated ( up to a certain @xmath6 ) by the unfolding of the oscillation . moreover",
    ", the former effect exhibits a peculiar growth with the energy which , as we will see , may give rise to a noticeable signature .",
    "new ( coherent ) effects during propagation manifest themselves as an effective potential contributions to the neutrino squared mass matrix @xmath7 , the potentially largest one contributing to @xmath8  @xcite . due to the large @xmath9-@xmath10 mixing ( @xmath11 )",
    ", the latter will affect both @xmath12 and @xmath2 oscillations .",
    "however , the effect in the @xmath2 channel is energy enhanced , while the one in the @xmath12 is not . as a consequence , the @xmath10 spectrum may have a striking enhancement at high energy contrary to the conventional msw prediction .",
    "direct event - by - event detection of such an effect ( as well as detection of effects in the @xmath13 channel )  @xcite would require a very granular detector for @xmath14 identification .",
    "would a coarse neutrino detector with only muon charge identification capability miss the peculiar feature of the signal and possibly confuse it with a pure oscillation signal ( or viceversa ) ? not completely , since the @xmath15 channel will contribute to the wrong sign muon spectrum through @xmath16 decay .",
    "this has also implications for the sensitivity of a wrong sign experiment to new physics , which becomes strongly dependent on the energy .",
    "such an unequivocal departure from msw predictions would represent a clean signal and a handle to separate the effect from standard oscillations or corrections to the production or detection interaction .",
    "another effect , not considered here since it would require a detector with ability of distinguishing between electron - like and neutral current - like events , would be a large increase of the latter sample , due to hadronic tau decays .",
    "the standard msw effect gives rise to diagonal contributions to the neutrino squared mass matrix proportional to the neutrino energy . at energies above the resonance ,",
    "those terms suppress the electron neutrino mixing . on the other hand",
    ", a flavor changing neutrino interaction would give rise to a non - diagonal term which , although smaller than the diagonal ones , will also grow with the neutrino energy . in the high energy limit , the two matter induced terms will eventually dominate the mass matrix . unlike in the conventional msw case , where the mixing angle goes to zero , in this case",
    "the mixing angle reaches an asymptotic value which measures the ratio between the flavor changing and flavor conserving interactions .",
    "the interest of this simple observation depends on the scale at which the new interaction starts to become relevant .",
    "this happens when the new matter term becomes comparable to the original entry in the squared mass matrix .",
    "particularly interesting is then a @xmath0-@xmath10 flavor changing interaction .",
    "the original @xmath17 term , as well as @xmath18 , is in fact suppressed by @xmath1 , the only neutrino mixing angle which is certainly not large . at the same time , the bounds on @xmath0-@xmath10 interactions are the weakest among all possible neutrino flavor changing interactions .",
    "let us discuss the points above in greater detail . the neutrino potential induced by @xmath19 interactions ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 represents an electron or a up or down quark ) can be parameterized as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the electron number density and @xmath25 ( see the appendix for a detailed discussion of the bounds on these parameters ) .",
    "the effective neutrino squared mass matrix @xmath26 is then @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the neutrino energy , @xmath29 is the mns mixing matrix in the usual parameterization and @xmath30 is the smaller squared mass difference .    in order to have an intuitive picture of the basic features of the effects under study , let us first of all set @xmath31 .",
    "whereas in this limit the angle @xmath32 becomes unphysical , in presence of new physics the cp - violating phase @xmath33 does not , contrary to what sometimes stated in the literature .",
    "in fact , the phase redefinition necessary to rotate @xmath33 away from the mixing matrix moves @xmath33 in the non - diagonal new interactions . in the convention",
    "in which the @xmath34 parameters are initially real and the mixing matrix is complex parameters as well . ] , the @xmath34 s become complex once the phase has been rotated away from the mixing matrix .    having set",
    "@xmath31 we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) as @xmath35 where we also set @xmath36 , @xmath37 and we denoted @xmath38 .",
    "the resonant energy @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of electrons per baryon in matter @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 enhancement of matter effects allows even small @xmath34 parameters to have a role at sufficiently high energy .",
    "this may happen at accessible energies especially in the case of the @xmath44 parameter , which is most weekly constrained  values of @xmath44 as large as 0.1 are not excluded , see the appendix .",
    "in fact , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the np term in @xmath47 would correspond to a maximal @xmath48 .",
    "in general , @xmath44 has an effect comparable to that of a @xmath49 . since machines with a sensitivity to @xmath50 as low as @xmath51",
    "are conceivable , we conclude that sensitivities well below @xmath52 are in principle achievable",
    ". of course , the standard oscillation effect could still be larger and hide the new effect .",
    "however , the @xmath44 term , as the @xmath53 one , has the additional merit of contributing to an entry of @xmath54 that is suppressed by @xmath1 is absence of new physics .",
    "therefore , the @xmath44 term becomes comparable to and then exceeds the standard one for energies @xmath55 , where latexmath:[${e_{\\text{np}}}=    @xmath1 .",
    "the regime where the new effects are comparable to the standard ones is within the reach of a machine producing neutrinos of maximum energy @xmath57 if @xmath58 for example , for @xmath59 , that condition becomes @xmath60 .",
    "we recall that @xmath61 corresponds to @xmath62 , a value one order of magnitude below the present bound and well within a typical sensitivity .    from the experimental point of view , a study of the effect in the @xmath63 channel through direct @xmath14 detection is certainly challenging .",
    "however , it is possible to take advantage of @xmath14 decays into muons to look for the effect in the spectrum of `` wrong sign '' muon events by means of a coarse neutrino detector with only muon identification capabilities ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "whereas a sizable @xmath53 might also give rise to some effects , we focus here on @xmath44 and set all the other @xmath64 parameters to zero in our numerical calculations .",
    "let us now discuss in greater detail the high energy enhancement of the @xmath10 spectrum in presence of a sizable @xmath44 and see that there is not a corresponding enhancement of the @xmath9 spectrum , despite the large mixing of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "to this aim let us consider the leading terms of the oscillation probabilities in the high energy limit @xmath65 and compare the cases with and without new physics .    in the standard case ( and in the @xmath31 limit )",
    "@xmath32 is unphysical and the @xmath11 rotation commutes with the matter term , so matter effects only modify @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath63 ( @xmath66 ) oscillation probability coincides with a two neutrino oscillation probability in matter with vacuum amplitude @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and squared mass difference @xmath69 . in the limit @xmath65 , the squared mass difference in matter @xmath70 grows with energy , canceling the @xmath71 dependence in the oscillating term of the probability",
    "however , the @xmath1 mixing angle gets suppressed by the large diagonal msw term , @xmath72 , so the transition probabilities still decrease as @xmath73 , [ eq : he1 ] @xmath74    in presence of @xmath0-@xmath10 or @xmath0-@xmath9 flavor changing interactions , the @xmath11 rotation does not commute with the matter term anymore . as a consequence ,",
    "the oscillation probability in the @xmath31 limit has not a simple two neutrino form .",
    "two squared mass differences enter the oscillation probabilities , @xmath69 and @xmath75 in the large @xmath43 limit .",
    "moreover , whereas the @xmath11 is essentially not affected , @xmath76 becomes @xmath77 and a non vanishing ( and physical ) 12 angle is generated @xmath78 .",
    "approximate analytical formulae for the oscillation probabilities are unfortunately quite cumbersome . at the moment , however , we are only interested to the leading contributions in the large @xmath43 limit , that have the following simple expression , [ eq : he2 ] @xmath79 where we included the leading @xmath80 correction to the energy - independent amplitudes .",
    "we explicitly see that the oscillation probability is not suppressed any more by two powers of the energy but reaches instead a constant value @xmath81 at high energies . in an experiment at a neutrino factory , the effect of such an energy independent probability",
    "is enhanced by the growth with energy of the neutrino flux and of the neutrino cross section .",
    "this gives rise to a striking ( approximately cubic before approaching the energy cut off ) growth of the signal with energy .    since @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "let us consider a cp - conserving case , so that both @xmath76 and @xmath34 can be made real .",
    "then if the two parameters have the same sign ( @xmath84 ) , the contributions to the amplitude will interfere constructively in the neutrino channel and destructively in the antineutrino one .",
    "viceversa , if the signs are opposite ( @xmath85 ) , the interference will be destructive for neutrinos and constructive for antineutrinos .",
    "the destructive interference will be maximal for @xmath86 , the energy at which the two contributions to the amplitude are comparable .",
    "the latter formula and previous considerations hold provided that @xmath87 , or @xmath88 , the condition for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : he2 ] ) to be valid at the energy at which the amplitude vanishes . for @xmath89",
    "the cancellation will be spoiled by the @xmath69 terms .",
    "( [ eq : he2 ] ) show that @xmath44 only affects @xmath90 at the leading order in @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath9 are largely mixed , @xmath91 also enters @xmath66 oscillations but only through subleading terms omitted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : he2]b ) .",
    "this is because the mixing takes place at atmospheric squared mass difference @xmath69 , which in the large @xmath80 high limit is subleading compared to the other squared mass difference @xmath75 .",
    "we can show now some examples of how the oscillation probability gets modified by the presence of this new interaction . for doing that we have to consider a specific case .",
    "let us consider then a model with no cp violation and @xmath92 , can always been made positive .",
    "then if cp is conserved @xmath44 is real but can have both signs . ] with oscillation parameters @xmath36 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , about ten times smaller than the present bound .",
    "it has to be noticed that the smaller the value of @xmath48 , the more visible new physics effects are .",
    "we consider a neutrino factory with @xmath97 muon decays , and a 40 kton detector with only muon identification capabilities , located at a distance of 3000 km from the accelerator .",
    "present data on flavor changing interactions suggest bounds on the various elements of the fci matrix as @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "even if we assume that @xmath101 is as large as the experimental bound , its effect on oscillation probabilities will be negligible .",
    "an @xmath102 at the experimental bound would give rise to non - negligible effects  @xcite but not to the high - energy enhancement we are focusing on , so we set @xmath103 .",
    "the effect of a sizable @xmath44 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : probet ] , where the solid histograms represent normal matter oscillations whereas the dashed histogram is the new physics case . assuming @xmath44 is close to the allowed maximum value , the oscillation probability gets modified in quite a dramatic way .",
    "we see that , while the normal oscillation probability decreases like @xmath104 , in the case of new physics the probability tends to a constant ; the difference is of course enhanced at high energy . for antineutrinos",
    ", we observe the same behavior at high energy , but we note a difference at intermediate energies @xmath105 .",
    "there , the two terms in the amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq : he2]a ) are comparable and their relative sign is opposite for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the effect of such a sign change is clearly visible but can not accounted for by eq .",
    "( [ eq : he2]a ) for small values of @xmath106 , as in the present example . on the contrary , for @xmath107 ( and e.g.  no cp - violation , @xmath76",
    ", @xmath44 both positive as in this example ) the sign change would lead to a suppression of the antineutrino probability located at @xmath108 , as apparent from eq .",
    "( [ eq : he2]a ) . in the latter case , the suppression of the antineutrino oscillation probability measures @xmath109 . in any case , the difference between the two cp - conjugated channels at @xmath105 represents a powerful tool to constrain the relative phase of @xmath76 and @xmath44 .    in the @xmath12 channel ,",
    "the effect of @xmath44 is quite different , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : th ] . at high energy , where the dominant squared mass difference is @xmath110 , the oscillation probabilities are not enhanced . on the contrary",
    ", the spectrum does not differ from the pure oscillation case apart from the normalization and falls with energy as in the standard msw case .",
    "the new physics term behaves as a larger @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino energy distribution in muon decays is the following : @xmath111\\ ] ] @xmath112\\ ] ] where @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the muon polarization , and @xmath115 is the angle between the muon polarization vector and the neutrino direction . in the laboratory frame , the shape of the energy distribution is preserved if a lorentz boost is applied , so if muons are accelerated to an energy @xmath116 , the spectral shape will be the same , with this time @xmath117 .",
    "the cleanest experimental observable to measure neutrino oscillation is the appearance of wrong - sign muons , i.e. muons observed in the detector with a charge opposite to those circulating in the storage ring .",
    "when positive muons circulate in the ring , electron neutrinos are produced via @xmath118 @xmath0 would then oscillate into @xmath9 , seen as negative ( wrong - sign ) muons in a far detector .",
    "also @xmath15 oscillations will contribute to this channel , via @xmath16 decays ( b.r .",
    "@xmath119 ) , that will produce muons of the same sign of those coming directly from @xmath120 oscillations .",
    "we already saw in the previous section that the presence of new physics in matter propagation could lead to a noticeable change of the @xmath15 oscillation probability for large neutrino energies , especially for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "this effect will then be visible in the wrong - sign muon spectrum due to @xmath16 decays .",
    "the fact that the neutrino factory flux increases for large energies allows a precise exploration of the high - energy oscillation probability . in figures [ fig : events-2 ] and [ fig : events-3 ] we show spectra for wrong - sign muon events in a neutrino factory with @xmath97 muon decays and a 40 kt far detector .",
    "the large difference observable between normal matter propagation and fci at high energy is almost only due to @xmath14 decays , since the effect of @xmath44 on @xmath120 oscillations is is smaller than in @xmath15 and significant only at intermediate energies , and since the very strong bound existing on @xmath121 prevents any measurable effect from this parameter .    in presence of new effects , one wonders whether it is possible to measure both the new physics parameters , in our case @xmath44 , and the oscillation parameters , in particular @xmath76 . the spectral information is essential for this purpose .",
    "only counting the number of wrong - sign muons will lead to the impossibility of correctly interpreting the observed neutrino transitions in the case of new physics .",
    "the role of @xmath16 decays is crucial here .",
    "if they were neglected and only direct @xmath120 transitions were considered , a confusion would arise between @xmath44 and @xmath1 even if the spectral information were taken into account  @xcite .    to be more general ,",
    "figure [ fig : contour ] shows 90% c.l .",
    "contours for observing fci effects for values of @xmath121 in the range @xmath122 , and @xmath48 between @xmath123 .    to produce this plot",
    "we consider an experiment observing a certain number of wrong - sign muons in the detector .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath1 has quite a small effect on the energy distribution , therefore can be extracted from a simple counting of the events .",
    "the other relevant parameters will be measured with very good precision from the `` dip '' of the disappearance of right - sign muons ( not much affected by new physics effects ) .",
    "the experiment makes a `` measurement '' of @xmath1 based on event counting , assuming that no new physics is present , and produces an expected energy spectrum for that particular value of @xmath1 . then the spectrum without new physics",
    "is compared with that actually observed , and a bin - by - bin @xmath124 is produced .",
    "if the @xmath124 probability of the two histograms to be equal is too small , we consider that no confusion can arise between new physics effects and normal oscillations .",
    "in obtaining figure [ fig : contour ] we have set the new cp - violating phase @xmath125 to zero .",
    "one wonders whether the fact that @xmath125 is actually unknown would spoil the results in the general case .",
    "we expect that this is not the case provided that data with both @xmath126 and @xmath127 circulating in the ring are used .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in the previous section , the comparison of the two sets of data allows in principle to determine the relative sign of @xmath76 and @xmath44 and , more generally , the new cp - violating phase @xmath125 .",
    "have a characteristic energy scale @xmath105 whereas the standard cp - violation and other effects related to a @xmath128 are enhanced at low energy .",
    "this offers an handle to distinguish the two sources of cp - violation as well . ] here , we have implicitly assumed that the information from the comparison of the two sets of data has been taken into account to constrain @xmath125 and we have hence used only one set for discussing the measurement of @xmath76 and @xmath44 .",
    "a detailed study of cp - violation in this framework is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we considered here the effects of a possible new flavor - changing interaction affecting the propagation of electron neutrinos in matter .",
    "contrary to new effects in neutrino production or interaction , already well constrained by short - baseline experiments , new physics in matter propagation would benefit from very long - baselines , like those considered for a future neutrino factory . the characteristic feature of this machine , i.e.  the increase of neutrino flux with energy , is also ideal for these studies since new interactions would not suffer from the @xmath129 suppression , and therefore be much more visible at high energy .",
    "we studied the problem in a quantitative way , assuming a coarse magnetized iron detector , and observed that , for new physics close to the present experimental bounds , a noticeable signal could be observed in @xmath2 transitions , exploiting the wrong - sign muons produced in @xmath3 decays .",
    "m.c . would like to thank the scuola normale of pisa for the kind ospitality during the last days of writeup of this paper .",
    "this work has been partially supported by miur and by the eu under tmr contract hprn  ct200000148 .",
    "in this appendix , we review and enlarge the analysis of the limits on the size of np contributions to @xmath54 . the general form of new four fermion operators leading to additional contributions to the neutrino coherent scattering with an ordinary medium is @xmath130 needless to say , eq .",

    "the @xmath34 parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) are then given by in terms of the @xmath131 in the equation above by @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the electron and neutron number densities respectively and we have omitted the flavor indexes .",
    "notice that the @xmath34 parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm ] ) have a mild dependence on the distance traveled through the @xmath135 ratio .",
    "a model independent limit on @xmath102 can be inferred from atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite : @xmath136 .",
    "significant limits on the single @xmath137s can be obtained if one assumes that the operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) originate from su(2)@xmath138 invariant operators",
    ". then experimental bounds on charged lepton processes imply  @xcite [ eq : limits ] @xmath139 since su(2)@xmath138 is broken , the limits above can be evaded . to what extent",
    "they can be evaded depends on how the operators eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) are generated and how su(2)@xmath138 breaking enters .",
    "the case of the exchange of a su(2)@xmath138 multiplet of bosons with su(2)@xmath138 breaking masses has been considered in  @xcite . in this case , the operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) are still related to the corresponding charged lepton operators .",
    "however , the limits can be relaxed by the su(2)@xmath138 breaking masses by a factor of about 7 without a conflict with the electroweak precision data .",
    "alternatively , the effect of su(2)@xmath138 breaking can be studied through an operator expansion in which the breaking shows up as the vev of the higgs fields in the higher order operators  @xcite .    in both cases above , the limits are inferred from the charged lepton sector by relating the effects in the two sectors .",
    "however , it is possible to generate the neutrino operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) without giving rise to any charged lepton effect through a known mechanism not considered before in this context . in the remainder of this appendix",
    ", we discuss the limits on these possible additional contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) from neutrino physics and see that they can not evade the limits reviewed above .",
    "suppose that some physics ( e.g.  warped or flat extra dimensions  @xcite ) gives rise to the operator @xmath140 since this operator only contribute to the neutrino wave function , bringing the neutrino kinetic term back in canonical form will generate new operators as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) but will not generate any operators involving charged leptons only  @xcite . the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) generated through this mechanism are [ eq : zren ] @xmath141 here the @xmath142 parameters are only constrained by neutrino experiments , that give  @xcite @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 . in turn , these bounds imply e.g. @xmath146 , @xmath147 , to be compared with the much more restrictive @xmath148 , @xmath149 quoted above .",
