    "dynamical systems quenched from a disordered into an ordered phase may display interesting coarsening phenomena  @xcite .",
    "a simple example is the ising model evolving by heat bath ( hbd ) or glauber dynamics ( gd ) . in the ordering phase of this model , starting with random initial conditions , patterns of ferromagnetic domains",
    "are formed whose typical size grows with time as @xmath0 . for zero temperature ,",
    "these domains are fully ordered and the domain walls evolving in time can be identified as bonds between oppositely oriented spins  @xcite .",
    "for nonzero temperature , however , it is hard to define domains and domain walls because it is difficult to distinguish between ` true ' domains and minority islands generated by thermal fluctuations .",
    "this situation emerges , for example , in the two - dimensional ( @xmath1 ) ising model at finite temperature below @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ figureone]a ) .",
    "recently b. derrida  @xcite proposed a method that allows one to measure properties related to coarsening in presence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "the main idea of this method lies in the comparision of two identical copies ( replicas ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the same system .",
    "both replicas are submitted to the same thermal noise , i.e. , their numerical updates are determined by the same sequence of random numbers .",
    "copy  @xmath3 starts with random initial conditions and begins to coarsen whereas copy  @xmath4 starts from a fully magnetized state and therefore remains ordered as time evolves .",
    "the assumption is that all spin flips occurring in replica @xmath4 can be regarded as thermal fluctuations .",
    "therefore , when a spin flip occurs simultaneously in both replicas , it can be considered as a thermal fluctuation , otherwise as a fluctuation due to the coarsening process .    in refs .",
    "@xcite this method was used to determine the fraction of persistent spins @xcite at nonzero temperature as a function of time . at zero temperature",
    "a spin is said to be persistent up to time @xmath5 if it never flipped before . in the ising model",
    "the fraction of persistent spins @xmath6 decays according to a power law @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an independent exponent . for the @xmath9 glauber model",
    "it was proved that @xmath10  @xcite whereas in higher dimensions @xmath8 could only be determined by numerical simulations  @xcite and approximation methods  @xcite . for @xmath11",
    ", however , the fraction of spins that never flipped decays exponentially since thermal fluctuations occur everywhere at some finite rate . to overcome this difficulty , derrida proposed to consider a spin as `` persistent '' if its temporal evolution in copies @xmath3 and @xmath4 is fully synchronized up to time @xmath5",
    "using this definition of persistence he analyzed the @xmath1 ising model and observed that @xmath6 decays algebraically for @xmath12 and saturates at some finite value for @xmath13 .",
    "below the critical temperature the exponent @xmath8 seems to be the same as for @xmath14 while at @xmath15 a different exponent is observed .",
    "an imperfection of the method developed by derrida is that only one type of domain can be identified , namely , those that are magnetized in the same way as system @xmath4 .",
    "therefore different spin flips in @xmath3 and  @xmath4 indicate the presence of oppositely magnetized domains rather than the presence of a domain wall .",
    "this means that persistent spins can be identified only in those domains which have the same orientation as copy  @xmath3 . for the same reason the method can not be used to analyze other properties such as , for example , the dynamics of domain walls .    in the present work we extend derrida s method in a way that domain walls can be identified . for this purpose",
    "we consider _ three _ replicas @xmath16 instead of two .",
    "as before , all replicas are submitted to the same realization of noise .",
    "replica  @xmath3 starts with random initial conditions and serves as the master copy in which the coarsening process takes place .",
    "the temporal evolution of replica @xmath3 is compared with that of replicas @xmath4 and @xmath17 , which start from fully ordered initial conditions with positive and negative magnetization , respectively . as in the original setup , domains with positive magnetization in copy @xmath3 exhibit the same thermal fluctuations as copy @xmath4 . likewise , thermal fluctuations in domains with negative magnetization in copy @xmath3 are synchronized with those in copy @xmath17 . along the domain walls , however , fluctuations in replica @xmath3 may occur that are different from those in @xmath4 as well as in @xmath17 . detecting such fluctuations by an appropriate observable ( to be defined below ) we are able to identify domain walls in a coarsening process at nonzero temperature .",
    "the remarkable efficiency of this method is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figureone]b .",
    "in addition , our technique allows one to measure interesting physical quantities such as , for example , the surface area of domains as a function of time . in what follows",
    "we restrict ourselves to the @xmath1 ising model evolving by hbd and gd .",
    "however , the technique can easily be generalized and may be applied to many other stochastic coarsening processes .",
    "for example , applying the method to the potts model with @xmath18 states per site requires introducing @xmath19 different replicas .",
    "a fundamental problem of numerical methods based on several replicas evolving under the same noise is that the results may depend on the algorithmic implementation .",
    "this was first observed in so - called damage spreading ( ds ) problems . in ds simulations",
    "@xcite two replicas of a nonequilibrium system , submitted to the same thermal noise , are started from slightly different initial conditions .",
    "if the difference between the two copies ( the damage ) stays finite or even diverges , the system is said to exhibit damage spreading . otherwise ,",
    "if the two replicas merge into a fully synchronized evolution , damage is said to heal .",
    "initially ds fascinated researchers , since it would have indicated the existence of different dynamical phases in stochastic models analogous to chaotic and regular phases in deterministic systems",
    ". however , later it was realized  @xcite that such ds phases are ambiguous since the usage of different but equivalent algorithms for the same dynamical system can lead to different ds phase structures  @xcite . for example , in the ising model with hbd damage always heals while in the case of gd damage may spread  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that gd and hbd , although indistinguishable on a single replica , are characterized by different correlations when two or more replicas are simulated using the same random numbers  @xcite . as we are going to demonstrate",
    ", a similar algorithmic dependence appears in the present numerical technique where several replicas submitted to the same noise are used to analyze coarsening processes .",
    "thus we have to verify to what extent the results obtained by derrida  @xcite in the case of hbd   are physically relevant or rather artifacts of different algorithmic schemes",
    ".    the article is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sectiontwo ] we define hbd and gd as well as an observable by which domain walls can be detected .",
    "our numerical results for hbd are presented in sec .",
    "[ sectionthree ] . by comparing results for hbd and gd",

    "the energy at time  @xmath5 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 runs over the nearest neighbors of site @xmath24 .",
    "the local field @xmath25 determines the transition probability @xmath26 for the spin @xmath27 at time @xmath5 :    @xmath28    hbd and gd differ in their update rules : in hbd the spin @xmath27 is _ oriented _ according to the local field @xmath25 by @xmath29\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are independent random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 . on the other hand , in gd the spin @xmath27",
    "is _ flipped _ depending on its previous orientation : @xmath31 & \\mbox{if $ \\sigma_i(t)=+1 $ } \\\\",
    "\\sigma_i(t){\\rm sgn}[1-p_i(t)-z_i(t ) ] & \\mbox{if $ \\sigma_i(t)=-1 $ } \\end{array } \\right . .\\ ] ] one can easily verify that in both dynamics the probability to get @xmath32 is the same , as expected from the equivalence between hbd and gd .",
    "let us now consider three replicas @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath17 and denote their spins by @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . as stated before , the initial conditions are @xmath36 , \\qquad \\sigma^b_i(0 ) = + 1 , \\qquad \\sigma^c_i(0 ) = -1\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 are random numbers between 0 and 1 .",
    "the three replicas evolve under the same realization of noise , i.e. , the same random numbers @xmath30 are used for the updates of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we now turn to the observables we want to analyze .",
    "derrida s definition for the fraction of persistent spins @xmath6 can be generalized easily : a spin @xmath33 is said to be `` persistent '' up to time @xmath5 if it experienced exclusively _ thermal _ fluctuations , which means that it was synchronized either with @xmath34 or with @xmath35 for the whole time , i.e. , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total number of sites .",
    "we will analyze this quantity numerically in secs .",
    "[ sectionthree]-[sectionfour ] .    in order to identify domain walls",
    ", we define an observable @xmath40 which compares replicas @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath17 at site  @xmath24 and its nearest neighbors .",
    "we consider site @xmath24 as belonging to a domain wall ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) if ( a ) site  @xmath24 or at least one of its nearest neighbors in copies @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in different states , _ and _ ( b ) if site @xmath24 or at least one of its nearest neighbors in copies @xmath3 and @xmath17 are in different states .",
    "since hbd and gd evolve independently on two ( even and odd ) sublattices , we assume that these nearest neighbors belong to the same sublattice ( for example , if @xmath42 , the nearest neighbors on the same sublattice are @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . formally the observable @xmath40 is defined by @xmath45 where @xmath23 runs over site  @xmath24 and its nearest neighbors on the same sublattice .",
    "it turns out that this observable allows one to identify domain walls , as illustrated for hbd in fig .",
    "[ figureone]b .",
    "the definition  ( [ observable ] ) appears to be quite complicated since it involves the nearest neighbors of site @xmath24 .",
    "it would have been more natural to define a local observable @xmath46 , which is @xmath47 if @xmath48 is different from @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( indicating a fluctuation generated by the coarsening process ) and @xmath51 otherwise : @xmath52 but , using the initial conditions specified in eq .",
    "( [ initialconditions ] ) , it would turn out that @xmath53 for all @xmath5 and for both hbd and gd .",
    "this is due to an overlap of the regions in @xmath3 which are synchronized with either @xmath4 or @xmath17 . for hbd",
    "this can be proven as follows .",
    "assume that the three replicas at time @xmath5 are in a state where the inequality @xmath54 holds for all @xmath24 .",
    "since the number of positive spins generated by the update rule  ( [ hbd ] ) for a given random number @xmath30 is monotonically increasing with @xmath26 , one can show that @xmath55 .",
    "therefore the inequality  ( [ hbdinequality ] ) is also satisfied at the next time step @xmath56 . since this inequality",
    "is satisfied by the initial conditions  ( [ initialconditions ] ) , it holds by induction at any time .",
    "this implies that events with @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not occur , hence @xmath53 for hbd . in the case of gd",
    "the proof is trivial : since replicas @xmath4 and @xmath17 evolve precisely in opposite states ( @xmath59 ) , the observable @xmath46 vanishes automatically .",
    "thus the local observable defined in eq .",
    "( [ naivedelta ] ) can not be used in order to detect domain walls .",
    "this is the reason we use the more complicated definition of eq .",
    "( [ observable ] ) .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for the @xmath1 ising model with hbd .",
    "we simulate three replicas of a system of size @xmath60 with periodic boundary conditions . starting with the initial conditions  ( [ initialconditions ] ) we measure the fraction of persistent spins @xmath6 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ persistenceobservable ] ) and the average peierls length ( circumference ) of the domains @xmath61 the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath62 are measured up to @xmath63 time steps and averaged over @xmath64 independent runs .",

    "[ figuretwo]-[figurethree ] .",
    "the results for the fraction of persistent spins @xmath6 ( see left hand graph in fig .  [ figuretwo ] ) are in full agreement with ref .",

    ", however , @xmath6 seems to vanish like @xmath68 with a different exponent @xmath69 ( the physical relevance of this exponent will be discussed in the sec .",
    "[ sectionfour ] ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath13 , @xmath6 saturates at some finite value .",
    "this can be explained as follows . for @xmath13 the total magnetization in copies",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath17 decays exponentially .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that under these conditions any difference between two replicas evolving by hbd vanishes exponentially , i.e. , damage heals spontaneously .",
    "this means that the replicas @xmath16 converge and eventually merge into a fully synchronized evolution within finite time and consequently a finite fraction of persistent spins survives .",
    "notice that in the limit @xmath70 all replicas are already synchronized after a single time step . for finite temperatures",
    "we observe a scaling behavior ( see right hand graph in fig .  [ figuretwo ] ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the dynamical critical exponent of hb dynamics and @xmath73 is a scaling function which behaves as @xmath74 for @xmath75 and saturates for @xmath76 . + the results for the total peierls length of the domains @xmath62 illustrated in fig .",

    "the corresponding scaling behavior reads @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a scaling function as shown in the right hand graph in fig .",
    "[ figurethree ] .",
    "the exponent @xmath78 in the subcritical regime may be interpreted as follows .",
    "the total number of domains @xmath83 in a large but finite sized system decreases as @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , the average size of the domains @xmath85 grows with time as @xmath86 .",
    "hence in the @xmath1 ising model the peierls length behaves as @xmath87 this result suggests that surfaces of domains in a coarsening ising model are _ regular _ , i.e. , they do not have a fractal structure at finite temperatures @xmath88 .",
    "this result can be explained as follows .",
    "the coarsening process is driven by the tendency of the systen to minimize its energy @xmath89 , i.e. , to minimize the surface area ( the peierls length @xmath62 ) of the domains .",
    "this makes it highly unlikely for the domain walls to form fractal structures .",
    "this mechanism works not only at zero temperature but prevails in the entire subcritical regime . to support this argument we plotted the energy @xmath89 against the peierls length in fig .",
    "[ figurefour ] .",
    "for @xmath90 the curves are monotonically decreasing with time and seem to have a well defined minimum at @xmath91 .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism for coarsening , apart from different time scales , is the same in the whole subcritical regime . in the disordered phase , however , the curves have a flat shape close to @xmath91 and therefore the dynamics of @xmath62 is no longer driven by the minimization of energy .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , any numerical technique based on several replicas of a nonequilibrium system evolving under the same realization of noise may depend in a crucial way on the algorithmic implementation of the dynamics .",
    "we now discuss this dependence in the present problem by comparing hbd and gd .",
    "hbd and gd are two different but equally legitimate algorithmic implementations of the _ same _ nonequilibrium process that mimics the evolution of an ising model in contact with a thermal reservoir . to understand this",
    ", it may be helpful to rewrite the update rule for gd  ( [ glauber ] ) as @xmath92 & \\mbox{if $ \\sigma_i(t)=+1 $ } \\\\",
    "{ \\rm sgn}[p_i(t)-\\{1-z_i(t)\\ } ] & \\mbox{if $ \\sigma_i(t)=-1 $ } \\end{array } \\right . .\\ ] ] this rule differs from hbd only inasmuch  depending on @xmath93  the random number @xmath30 or @xmath94 is used . since in a simulation of a single replica",
    "each random number is used only once , it makes no difference whether @xmath30 or @xmath94 enters the update rule and therefore both dynamical procedures are fully equivalent . in other words , looking at the space - time trajectory of a _ single _ ising model , one can not distinguish whether it was generated by hbd or gd .",
    "however , if we consider more than one replica evolving under the same noise , each random number @xmath30 is used several times leading to different correlations @xmath95 the replicas depending on whether hbd or gd are used .",
    "hbd and gd are two members of an infinite family of equivalent dynamical rules  @xcite .",
    "all these rules are equally legitimate and there is no reason to prefer particular rules such as hbd or gd . _ physical _ properties , however , should not depend on the choice of the dynamical procedure .",
    "thus , in order to prove the algorithmic independence of a specific result , one would have to verify all these rules separately .",
    "since this is practically impossible , we will restrict ourselves to the examples of hbd and gd .",
    "we will show that some of the previous results are affected by a change of the procedure and hence are physically irrelevant whereas others are not .",
    "we now repeat the numerical simulations described in the previous section using gd instead of hbd . a snapshot of the simulation is shown in fig .  [ figurefive ] .",
    "comparing figs .",
    "[ figureone]b and  [ figurefive]b we notice that the hbd algorithm yields very clean shapes for the peierls contours while gd produces a lot of additional fluctuations . on the other hand",
    "the contours in the glauber case are strictly closed because of symmetry reasons whereas for hbd there are missing links ( two of them are marked by arrows in fig .",
    "[ figureone]b ) .",
    "we would like to note that any dynamical rule used in the present problem should synchronize the evolution of replicas @xmath96 or @xmath97 in the interior of large domains . in the terminology of ds",
    "this means that damage has to heal .",
    "as hbd is the most correlated algorithm , damage heals very rapidly and thus yields high resolution in the determination of the walls . on the other hand gd in @xmath1 is known to exhibit a ds transition at @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "the simulations in fig .",
    "[ figurefive]b at @xmath99 take place very close to this transition which explains why the output is rather noisy .",
    "the numerical results for gd and hbd are significantly different ( see fig .  [ figuresix ] ) . only at zero temperature where gd and hbd coincide",
    "does one obtain identical results .",
    "for @xmath100 the fraction of persistent spins @xmath6 exhibits similar behavior in both cases : it first decays and then crosses over to an algebraic decay @xmath101 with the same @xmath102 as in the @xmath14 case .",
    "this suggests that the crossover phenomenon is an intrinsic physical property of the @xmath1 ising model rather than an algorithmic artifact . at criticality",
    ", however , gd indicates an algebraic decay @xmath103 .",
    "this is clearly different from the decay @xmath104 observed in the case of hbd .",
    "therefore one may wonder about the physical meaning of @xmath6 at criticality .",
    "this problem may be circumvented by a systematic study of the crossover time as a function of temperature .",
    "the results for the total peierls length of the domains are even more contradictory . while in the hbd case we found an algebraic decay @xmath105 for @xmath12 , we observe continuously varying exponents in the case of gd .",
    "if this was true , it would imply that the peierls length per domain grows like @xmath106 with some temperature - dependent exponent @xmath107 indicating a `` fractal '' structure of the domain walls .",
    "indeed , visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ figurefive]b makes it intuitively clear how such a `` fractal '' structure emerges .",
    "it is therefore tempting to discard the results for gd and to declare the smooth lines in fig .",
    "[ figureone]b as ` true ' domain walls .",
    "however , as explained above , we have no justification for doing so !",
    "therefore the method described in this paper can not be used to determine the fractal dimension of domain walls on a safe ground .",
    "nevertheless hbd gives us a lower bound for the exponent  @xmath108 .",
    "it is thus very likely , although not strictly proven , that domain walls in the coarsening ising model at nonzero temperature do not have a fractal structure .",
    "by introducing three replicas of a @xmath1 ising model evolving under the same realization of noise we extend the numerical method proposed by b. derrida  @xcite in a way that domain walls can be identified . using hbd we measured the peierls length of coarsening domains in the @xmath1 ising model .",
    "our simulations confirm previous results and suggest that domain walls in the ising model at @xmath90 are regular , i.e. , they do not have fractal properties .",
    "a fundamental problem appearing here and related to the use of several replicas is the algorithmic dependence . as an example we compared hbd and gd .",
    "it turns out that the persistence exponent below the critical temperature is the same in both cases which suggests that this result is in fact related to a physical property rather than algorithmic artifacts . on the other hand",
    ", the peierls length of the domain walls grows differently for hbd and gd , although it seems that hbd gives the correct result .    in this context",
    "we would like to note that very recently a different method for the numerical estimation of the persistence exponent @xmath8 has been proposed  @xcite where the persistence probability is defined in terms of spin blocks . by analyzing the scaling behavior for different block sizes one can determine @xmath8 even at finite temperature .",
    "although this method can not be used to identify domain walls , it is very interesting since it uses only a single replica wherefore the results do not depend on whether hbd or gd is used . in agreement with ref .",
