    "recent successful detection @xcite of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in dilute bosonic atoms employing magnetic trap at ultra - low temperature has intensified experimental activities on various aspects of the condensate . on the theoretical front , numerical simulation based on the time - dependent nonlinear mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp )",
    "equation @xcite has provided a satisfactory account of some of these experiments @xcite . since the detection of bec for @xmath1li atoms with attractive interaction , one problem of extreme interest is the dynamical study of the formation and decay of bec for attractive atomic interaction @xcite .    for attractive interaction",
    "the condensate is stable for a maximum critical number @xmath2 of atoms @xcite .",
    "measurements for @xmath2 @xcite are in reasonable agreement with the mean - field analyses for bec of @xmath1li in a spherically symmetric trap @xcite , although there is some discrepancy for bec of @xmath0rb in an axially symmetric trap @xcite .",
    "if the number of atoms can somehow be increased beyond this critical number , due to interatomic attraction the condensate collapses emitting atoms until the number of atoms is reduced below @xmath2 and a stable configuration is reached . with a supply of atoms from an external source",
    "the condensate can grow again and thus a series of collapses can take place , that was observed experimentally in the bec of @xmath1li with attractive interaction @xcite .",
    "theoretical mean - field analysis has been able to explain this dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently a more challenging experiment has been performed by donley et al .",
    "@xcite at jila on an attractive condensate of @xmath0rb atoms @xcite in an axially symmetric trap , where they manipulated the interatomic interaction by changing the external magnetic field exploiting a nearby feshbach resonance @xcite . in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance the atomic scattering length @xmath3 can be varied over a huge range by adjusting the external magnetic field .",
    "consequently , they were able to change suddenly the atomic scattering length by a large amount for a bec of @xmath0rb atoms @xcite .",
    "they even changed the sign of the scattering length , thus transforming a repulsive condensate into an attractive one .",
    "the original experiment on attractive @xmath1li atoms @xcite did not use a feshbach resonance , hence the atomic interaction was fixed .",
    "this restricts the number of atoms in the @xmath1li bec to a number close to @xmath2 and the collapse is driven by a stochastic process @xcite .    in the experiment conducted at jila , donley et al",
    ". changed a stable pre - formed repulsive condensate of @xmath0rb atoms into a highly explosive and collapsing attractive condensate and studied the dynamics of collapsing and exploding condensates @xcite .",
    "the natural scattering length of @xmath0rb atoms is negative ( attractive ) . by exploiting the feshbach resonance they made it positive ( repulsive ) in the initial state , where the number of atoms , unlike in the experiment with @xmath1li @xcite , could be arbitrarily large .",
    "so immediately after the jump in the scattering length to a large negative value , one has a highly unstable bec , where the number of atoms could be much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "donley et al .",
    "have provided a quantitative estimate of the explosion of this bec by measuring the number of atoms remaining in the condensate as a function of time until an equilibrium is reached .",
    "they claim that their experiment reveal many interesting phenomena that challenge theoretical models .",
    "because the phenomenon looks very much like a tiny supernova , or exploding star , the researchers dubbed it a  bosenova \" .",
    "the fundamental physical process underlying the explosion remains a mystery .    in this paper",
    "we perform a mean - field analysis based on the time - dependent gp equation to understand some aspects of the above collapse and explosion of the attractive condensate of @xmath0rb atoms in an axially symmetric trap . to account for the loss of atoms from the strongly attractive condensate we include an absorptive nonlinear three - body recombination term in the gp equation .",
    "three - body recombination leads to the formation of diatomic molecules with liberation of energy responsible for energetic explosion with ejection of matter from the bec .",
    "this process could be termed  atomic fusion \" in contrast to nuclear fusion in stars .",
    "the three - body recombination rate we use in numerical simulation is in agreement with previous experimental measurement @xcite and theoretical calculation @xcite .",
    "the numerical method , we use , for the solution of the time - dependent gp equation with an axially symmetric trap has appeared elsewhere @xcite . we find that the present mean - field numerical simulation provides a fair description of some features of the experiment at jila @xcite .",
    "there have been other theoretical studies based on the mean - field gp equation @xcite to deal with dynamical collapse including an absorptive term to account for the loss of particles . in most cases",
    "the loss mechanism is three - body recombination as in the present study .",
    "however , duine and stoof @xcite propose that the loss arises due to a new elastic process . instead of attempting a full numerical solution of the gp equation with axial symmetry , these investigations used various approximations to study the time evolution of the condensate or employed a spherically symmetric trap .",
    "duine and stoof @xcite consider the full anisotropic dynamics , but use a gaussian approximation for the wave function rather than an exact numerical solution .",
    "most of the other studies employed a spherically symmetric trap @xcite .",
    "however , the investigation of ref . @xcite employed an axially symmetric trap to describe some aspects of the experiment at jila and we comment on this work in sec .",
    "iv . in the present investigation",
    "we consider the complete numerical solution of the mean - field gp equation for an axially symmetric trap as in the experiment at jila .",

    "there are many ways to account for the loss mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is quite impossible to include them all in a self consistent fashion .",
    "here we simulate the atom loss via the most important quintic three - body term @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "an accurate representation of the variation of @xmath12 of @xmath0rb near the feshbach resonance is beyond the scope of this study and here we represent this variation via a quadratic dependence : @xmath40 .",

    "@xcite , the burst atoms and missing atoms are components of expelled atoms which lose contact with the central condensate that eventually forms the remnant . of these the burst atoms",
    "have energy much less than the magnetic trap depth . hence , though expelled from the central condensate they continue trapped and oscillate with time . the wave function of eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) only describes the central condensate .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the burst atoms are considered to be the peripheral part ( the spikes ) of the central condensate and hence taken to be described by the mean - field eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "the missing atoms are actually parts of the expelled atoms that have disappeared from the trap @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the missing atoms have been taken to be the only component of the emitted atoms .",
    "these are the main differences between the point of view of the present analysis and that of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the three - body loss rates of the two studies are also widely different . here",
    "we employ the three - body recombination loss - rate @xmath176 @xmath87/s for @xmath177 whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite the value @xmath178 @xmath87/s has been considered .",
    "the present rate is in rough agreement with the experimental rate of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath179 @xmath87/s ) and with the theoretical rate of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath180 @xmath87/s ) for the same value of scattering length whereas that of ref .",
    "@xcite is orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "however , such a small three - body rate in ref .",
    "@xcite has led to a large residual condensate at large time that they have interpreted as the sum of burst plus remnant .",
    "the use of a large three - body rate in this study has led to a much smaller residual central condensate which has been identified as the remnant as in the experiment at jila @xcite .    however , it is assuring to see that the @xmath102 vs. @xmath140 curve of the two models in fig .",
    "4 agrees with each other . the present calculation in fig .",
    "4 was performed with a nonzero loss rate @xmath12 , whereas that in ref .",
    "@xcite was performed by setting @xmath181 .",
    "we find that @xmath12 plays an insignificant role in this calculation at small times .",
    "hence , the two computer routines lead to the same result in the absence of recombination loss before the beginning of the explosion .",
    "in conclusion , we have employed a numerical simulation based on the accurate solution @xcite of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation with a cylindrical trap to study the dynamics of the collapse and explosion as observed in the recent experiment at jila @xcite . in the gp equation",
    "we include a quintic three - body nonlinear recombination loss term that accounts for the decay of the strongly attractive condensate .",
    "the results of the present simulation accounts for some aspects of the experiment .    in the experiment",
    "a strongly attractive @xmath0rb condensate was prepared by ramping the scattering length to a large negative value and the subsequent decay of the collapsing and exploding condensate was measured .",
    "we have been able to understand the following features of this dynamics from the present numerical simulation : ( 1 ) the condensate undergoes collapse and explosion and finally stabilizes to a remnant condensate containing about @xmath145 ( for @xmath146 ) to @xmath182 ( for @xmath144 ) of initial number of atoms @xmath33 at large times .",
    "this percentage is independent of @xmath33 and the ramped scattering length @xmath183 the number in the remnant condensate can be much larger than the critical number for collapse @xmath2 for the same atomic interaction for experimental times on the order of tens of milliseconds .",
    "( 2 ) both in the experiment and our simulation the remnant condensate executes radial and axial oscillations in a highly excited collective state for a long time with frequencies @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( 3 ) after the sudden change in the scattering length to a large negative value , the condensate needs an interval of time @xmath186 before it experiences loss via explosion .",
    "consequently , the decay starts after the interval of time @xmath186 .",
    "( 4 ) the number of atoms in the condensate decays exponentially with a decay constant @xmath133 of few milliseconds ( @xmath187 ms ) .    to conclude , a large part of the bosenova experiment on @xmath0rb atoms at jila @xcite , specially the detailed behavior of the remnant , can be understood by introducing the rather conventional three - body recombination loss in the standard mean - field gp equation , with a loss rate compatible with other studies @xcite .",
    "the study of the detailed behavior of the burst and missing atoms and the formation of the jet in such a mean - field theory seems to be more complicated technically , nevertheless viable , and would be a subject of future investigation .",
