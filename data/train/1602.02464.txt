    "these works are successful for surfaces with spherical or euclidean geometry , but they are too week to give a regular homotopy classification in the case of hyperbolic surfaces . the aim of this paper is to introduce two types of winding numbers of a regular closed curve on an _ aspherical _ surface , _ i.e. _ a surface with euclidean or hyperbolic geometry .    let us review how the winding numbers were defined in earlier works . to a regular closed curve @xmath3\\to { \\mathbb r}^2 $ ]",
    ", whitney associates an angle function @xmath4\\to{\\mathbb r}$ ] which measures the angle of the tangent vector from the positive direction of the @xmath5-axis , and defined the winding number to be @xmath6 . in the case of an arbitrary surface",
    ", there is no preferred direction .",
    "the basic idea of reinhart and chillingworth is to use a continuous vector field @xmath7 on the surface to measure how the tangent vector of the curve rotates with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "this is fine in the euclidean case , because there are vector fileds with no singular points on them . in the other cases , we need to allow the vector field to have singular points .",
    "then , when a regular homotopy hits a singular point of @xmath7 , the ` winding number ' jumps ! therefore , winding numbers are defined in some quotient @xmath8 of @xmath9 .",
    "luckily , in the spherical case the @xmath10-winding number can be used to classify the regular closed curves . on the sphere",
    "there are two regular homotopy classes ; on the projective plane there are two free homotopy classes of closed curves and in each of them there are two regular homotopy classes which can be distinguished by the @xmath10-winding numbers .",
    "as long as we stick to vector fields on the surface , we will never get a winding number which is strong enough to classify the regular homotpy classes . since the spherical surfaces are quite exceptional among the surfaces , i propose to study only aspherical surfaces and use non - vanishing vector fields on the universal covers of the surfaces .",
    "slightly more precisely , we consider a riemannian surface @xmath11 with a nice conformal ( or _ isogonal _ ) embedding of the universal cover @xmath12 into the euclidean plane @xmath2 .",
