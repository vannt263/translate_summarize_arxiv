    "in 1996 , an abrupt enhancement of the heat transport efficiency ( @xmath2 ) was reported in a convection cell driven at very high rayleigh numbers ( @xmath1 ) @xcite ( the definitions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are recalled later ) .",
    "this observation was understood as the signature of a new regime of convection , named the `` ultimate '' regime , and was interpreted following a prediction by r. kraichnan @xcite .",
    "however this observation was in apparent contradiction with some earlier @xmath3 measurements which did not evidence any new regime in nearly similar conditions @xcite .",
    "this situation ignited a controversy which has grown up over the years , as additional observations seemed to confirm both the transiting dataset from grenoble and the non - transiting one from chicago .",
    "today , this issue is often considered as one of the most important open problem in convection and is driving experimental and numerical efforts worldwide .",
    "the ability to extrapolate laboratory results to environmental flows , for example , is strongly impaired by our lack of understanding of turbulent convection at very high rayleigh numbers @xcite .    table [ table : maniphautsra ] summarizes the main specifications of rayleigh - bnard experiments reaching very high @xmath1 .",
    "bibliographic references are provided in the last column . for convenience ,",
    "a name is attributed to each experiment performed in grenoble ( @xmath4 column ) .",
    "figure [ flo : fig - nura - compil ] gathers measurements of the compensated heat transfer efficiency @xmath5 versus @xmath1 . for completeness , a numerical simulation is included on the plot while -for clarity- a few experiments from grenoble",
    "are omitted .",
    "the chicago data have been re - calculated using improved he properties fits and corrected for a sidewall spurious effect ( see @xcite for details on both corrections ) .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates that below @xmath6 , all experiments are in reasonable agreement while different trends appear above @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the compensated heat transfer @xmath5 decreases with @xmath1 in some experiments ( chicago , oregon , gttingen ) while it increases in others ( grenoble , trieste ) , leading up to nearly 100% difference in heat transfer efficiency around @xmath8 .",
    "the convection community does nt agree on the description of the results at very high @xmath1 .",
    "for example , a recent review on convection concludes `` _ _ though the grenoble experiments suggest such a transition near @xmath9 neither the oregon - trieste experiments nor numerical simulations do so .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is presently unresolved _ _ [ ... ] . ''",
    "@xcite , while we tend to consider that trieste experiment ( red star on figure [ flo : fig - nura - compil ] ) and delft simulations ( continuous line on figure [ flo : fig - nura - compil ] ) rather seem to fall into the group of transiting cells . beside",
    ", we will argue in section [ sectionpr ] that the cited experiments are not in disagreement .",
    "the terminology used in the literature probably adds to the confusion .",
    "for example , the adjective  ultimate \" introduced by chavanne to name the new regime found in grenoble , has been used in the literature to refer to four different items : i ) the regime observed in grenoble ( regardless of its interpretation ) , ii ) the concept of asymptotic regime of convection iii ) kraichnan s model , iv ) a homogeneous turbulent flow forced by a thermal gradient @xcite . to avoid any confusion",
    ", we will avoid to refer to `` ultimate regime '' or `` ultimate state '' , and we will call the `` grenoble regime '' the regime which has been found and studied in grenoble over the last 15 years .",
    "the definitions of the rayleigh , prandtl and nusselt numbers are :    @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient , the molecular thermal diffusivity , the kinematic viscosity , the gravitational acceleration and the cell height .",
    "@xmath18 is the power that would diffuse through the cell if the fluid was quiescent .",
    "the total power @xmath19 transported across the cell and the temperature difference @xmath20 driving the flow are corrected to take the adiabatic gradient into account .",
    "we recall that this correction is exact .     versus @xmath1 for very high @xmath1 experiments in cylindrical cell of aspect ratio @xmath21 and for @xmath22 .",
    "datasets from grenoble ( green asterisks [ _ _ chavanne cell , @xmath23 _ _ ] , magenta pointing - up triangles [ _ _ vintage cell , @xmath23 _ _ ] , blue disks [ _ _ flange cell , @xmath23 _ _ ] , grey diamonds [ _ _ paper cell , @xmath23 _ _ ] , orange diamonds [ _ _ short - cell , @xmath24 _ _ ] , trieste [ red stars , @xmath25 , oregon [ brown pointing - down triangles , @xmath23 ] , gttingen [ purple stars , @xmath23 ] and chicago after correction ( see text ) [ black disks , @xmath23 ] .",
    "the line corresponds to delft t - rans numerical simulations in an aspect ratio 8:8:1 cell . ]",
    "the initial motivation of this paper are two questions hereafter .",
    "they are addressed varying independently the rayleigh number ( within @xmath27 ) and the prandtl number ( within @xmath22 ) , in order to disentangle the influence of these two control parameters .    1 .   what is the nature of the grenoble regime",
    "in particular , is it the regime predicted by kraichnan ? 2 .",
    "what are the triggering conditions of the grenoble regime ? as recalled later , kraichnan s model does nt describe the transition region , which leaves us with no precise prediction .    to address these questions",
    ", we performed a set of experiments which are described in section [ sectionmanip ] .",
    "the following three sections explore the roles of the prandtl number ( section [ sectionpr ] ) , the large scale circulation of the flow ( section [ sectionlsc ] ) and the sidewall of the cell ( section [ sectionsidewall ] ) in the triggering of the grenoble regime .",
    "section [ discu ] summarizes the characteristics of this regime , and discusses them in connection with kraichnan s model .",
    "finally , the appendix presents a systematic study of non - boussinesq effects , both experimental and theoretical .",
    "the seven cryogenic convection cells of present study are named the _ flange _ , _ paper _ , _ cigar _ , _ screen _ , _ vintage _ , _ thickwall _ and _ short _ cells .",
    "all of them are cylindrical with diameter @xmath28 and heights @xmath29 ( _ short - cell _ ) , @xmath30 ( _ cigar - cell _ ) and @xmath31 ( all the others ) , corresponding to aspect ratios @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see figures [ fig : cellules ] and [ flo : fig - allcells ] ) .",
    "the various top and bottom plates are @xmath34-cm - thick except for the conical top plate appearing on figure [ fig : cellules]-a / b which is 10-cm - thick ( _ short - cell _ ) .",
    "the conductivities of two cu plates have been measured in - situ , as described in @xcite and we found @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 for standard and ofhc cu respectively .",
    "the other plates , most made of annealed ofhc cu , are expected to have thermal conductivities of the same order . the heat capacity of the bottom plates ( sidewall flange and screws included ) has been measured to be @xmath38 .",
    "the measured roughness of all these cu plates is typically @xmath39 to @xmath40 , depending on the cell , where @xmath41 is the arithmetic average of the absolute vertical deviation ( often noted @xmath42 ) .",
    "the flatness of the surfaces in contact with the fluid was typically within @xmath43 for all cells , except for one which has a @xmath44 deep bump on a side .",
    "for the record , the non - corrugated brass plate used in a previous experiment @xcite had a roughness of @xmath45 and a flatness within @xmath46 .",
    "several seamless stainless steel sidewalls have been used , with thicknesses @xmath47 ( _ thickwall cell _ ) and @xmath48 ( all the other cells ) .",
    "the thermal conductance of each sidewall was measured in - situ .",
    "the conductance of the _ paper _ , _ screen _ and _ vintage _ cells was @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",
    "the _ flange _ , _ short _ , _ thickwall _ and _ cigar _ cells conductances were respectively 1.15 , 2.3 , 4.8 and 0.5 times larger .",
    "the sidewall of the _ flange cell _ was assembled using two sidewalls of aspect ratio close to unity ( see figure [ fig : cellules]-d ) ; the motivation was to mimic the design of the oregon cell .",
    "the parasitic contribution of sidewalls on @xmath2 was corrected using the analytical model from @xcite , confirmed in @xcite .",
    "this correction is very small at the very high @xmath1 of interest .",
    "for instance , around @xmath51 , the absolute value of the local scaling exponent of the heat transfer law @xmath3 would be typically 0.01 larger without correction .",
    "the connection between the plate and the sidewall is detailed in @xcite : it is such that the bottom ( top ) flange of the sidewall lies below ( above ) the bottom ( top ) plate - fluid interface .",
    "the cells are hanging vertically in a cryogenic - grade vacuum , except for the _ vintage cell _ which was tilted by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the top plate is cooled by a helium bath at @xmath37 through a calibrated thermal resistance ( typically @xmath54 at @xmath55 ) .",
    "the temperature is regulated by a pid controller .",
    "a constant and distributed joule heating @xmath19 is delivered on the bottom plate .",
    "the heat leak from the bottom plate to the surrounding has been measured in - situ in a few experiments ( @xmath56 at @xmath57 ) and it is three to four decades smaller than the lowest heating applied on the bottom plate to generate convection .",
    "this leak is mainly due to the radiative transfer to the environment at @xmath58 .",
    "this excellent thermal control is one of the advantages of our cryogenic environment over room temperature convection experiments , along with the excellent thermal properties of the cu which provide isothermal plates up to the highest heat flux @xcite .",
    "the temperature difference @xmath20 between the plates is measured with an accuracy down to @xmath59 thanks to specifically designed thermocouples . for comparison ,",
    "the smallest @xmath20 in our experiments are around @xmath60 .",
    "the temperature of each plate is measured with various _",
    "ge _ thermistances .",
    "their calibration is checked in - situ against the critical temperature @xmath61 of the fluid with a resolution of @xmath62 . to avoid a common misunderstanding ,",
    "we stress that all the @xmath3 measurements are done far away from the critical point , as argued in [ nob ] .",
    "the critical point is simply used here as a thermodynamical reference to cross - check temperature calibration .",
    "cells are filled with various @xmath63 densities , ranging from dilute gas to liquid , and then closed with a cryogenic needle valve located close to the cell .",
    "the amount of _ he _ introduced in the cell is measured in a calibrated tank at room temperature , and it is occasionally cross - checked at low temperature by measuring the condensation temperature .",
    "a thermosiphon hanging in vacuum between the valve and the cell prevents convective transfer in the filling line .",
    "_ he _ properties are calculated as described in @xcite .",
    "most of the measurements are performed for temperature and densities where the accuracy on _ he _ properties is the best , for example at @xmath64 or around @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "figure [ flo : fig - rapr - grenoble ] represent the _ vintage _ , _ flange _ , _ paper _ , _ short _ , _ thickwall _ , _ screen _ and _ cigar _ cells datasets in the @xmath66 parameter space .",
    "contrary to a common misconception of cryogenic convection experiments , @xmath1 can be varied at a given @xmath67 , as illustrated in this figure and already in previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "each subset of constant @xmath67 data is obtained while working at a fixed mean temperature @xmath68 and mean volumetric mass @xmath69 . for each of these subsets , the local scaling exponent of the @xmath3 law -that is @xmath70- , can be determined with high accuracy because the uncertainty on the fluid properties prefactors appearing in @xmath2 and @xmath1 vanishes .",
    "the local exponents determined for each of these experiments are plotted on figure [ flo : fig - exposants ] .",
    "on such a plot , the transition to the grenoble regime can be easily spotted by the increase of the exponent above the 1/3 value .",
    "we underline the variability of the transition , both in term of transitional @xmath1 ( nearly two decades ) and in terms of strength with exponent from 0.36 up to 0.44 at @xmath71         law in various rayleigh - bnard cells for @xmath22 . ]",
    "this section compiles existing measurements and report new ones on the interplay between the prandtl number @xmath67 and the grenoble regime .      figure [ flo :",
    "fig - rapr - gamma05]-a gathers various very high @xmath1 measurements in cylindrical aspect ratio @xmath23 rayleigh - bnard cells .",
    "the yellow area encircles all the measurements taken in the grenoble regime .",
    "reversely , nearly all the datasets reaching very high @xmath1 without experiencing a ( clear ) transition are falling outside this area .",
    "a few points from chicago are falling close to this area .",
    "very interestingly , these points seems to experience a small heat transfer enhancement as shown on the figures [ flo : fig - rapr - gamma05 ] ( right side subplots ) .",
    "another interesting point is chavanne points for @xmath72 and @xmath73 : no heat transfer enhancement is distinguishable on these points , which is consistent with the location in the @xmath66 parameter space . as a first point , it is worth stressing that the cryogenic data from grenoble , chicago and oregon are not in disagreement as long as differences in @xmath67 are regarded . as a second point ,",
    "in addition to the very high @xmath1 condition , the transition is favoured above a @xmath74 threshold .",
    "the only possible contradiction between these very high @xmath1 datasets may be found around @xmath75 , with the lyon water experiment@xcite , which reported no transition .",
    "the corresponding dataset seems in contradiction over half a decade of @xmath1 , right above the transition .",
    "we will show that the transition threshold can greatly vary from one cell to another depending on the sidewall boundary conditions ( section [ sectionsidewall ] ) .",
    "this may explain the apparent contradiction .",
    "another possible explanation are accuracy issues at the highest @xmath1 in room temperature experiments due to significant correction of plate effects , which could mask the onset of a transition .",
    "further investigations in this region of the parameter space , with smaller _ he _ cells and larger water ones , would be useful .    unfortunately , by lack of available experiments , it is not yet possible to generalise this @xmath66 phase - space description to cells with other aspect ratios and shapes .",
    "however , we will show in section [ sectionsidewall ] that the transition @xmath1 has a strong aspect - ratio dependence in the range @xmath76 , at least for @xmath67 of order one .",
    "experiments with aspect ratio @xmath23 .",
    "right : chicago dataset .",
    "the points which are the closest to the yellow area are marked with full symbols ( blue disks and red diamonds for the closest ones ) , while the others are plotted with open squares.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( a )     experiments with aspect ratio @xmath23 .",

    "the points which are the closest to the yellow area are marked with full symbols ( blue disks and red diamonds for the closest ones ) , while the others are plotted with open squares.,title=\"fig : \" ] ( c )      does the @xmath1 of the onset of the transition depend on @xmath67 ?",
    "figure [ flo : fig - pr]-a gives the local scaling exponent of @xmath3 around the transition within @xmath77 .",
    "as can been seen , there is no @xmath67-dependence of the transition @xmath1 , within accuracy , in this limited range of @xmath67 .",
    "as we will show later , the reynolds numbers associated with the large scale circulation ( lsc ) in our @xmath23 cells roughly scale like @xmath78 ( see figure [ flo : fig - lsc-3 ] ) .",
    "if the transition was triggered when @xmath79 reaches a critical value , a threefold increase of @xmath67 would shift the transitional @xmath1 by a factor @xmath80 .",
    "this is not compatible with the result presented on figure [ flo : fig - pr]-a which indicates a weaker -if any- dependence .",
    "figure [ flo : fig - pr]-b presents the same exponents versus @xmath81 ( estimated with the above fit ) and shows that the transition does not occur for a unique value of @xmath81 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn for the aspect ratio @xmath24 cell over the same range of @xmath67 .",
    "this suggests that the transition is not simply triggered by the lsc shear on the boundary layers .",
    "we will confirm this important result later .",
    "figure [ flo : fig - lsc-3]-a shows the @xmath3 local scaling exponent versus @xmath67 over a limited window of very high @xmath1 , and for three cells with aspect ratio from 0.23 to 1.14 .",
    "the @xmath1-window is chosen significantly above the transitional @xmath1 of each cell , with the purpose to be in the region where the new regime is well established .",
    "no systematic dependence of the local exponent versus @xmath67 is detectable within uncertainty within @xmath82 .",
    "the best fit for @xmath83 at constant and high @xmath1 gives @xmath84 .    as a conclusion on this section ,",
    "a first requirement for the occurrence of a transition is that the rayleigh number is above a @xmath67-independent threshold . in aspect",
    "ratio @xmath85 cells , a second requirement has been evidenced : @xmath67 should be above a @xmath1-dependent threshold .",
    "both requirements are summarized by the phase space of figure [ flo : fig - rapr - gamma05 ] .",
    "once the transition has occurred , the prandtl number is found to have a small -if any- effect on heat transfer .",
    "we recall that our analysis focuses on the range @xmath86 : it is therefore possible that this window of prandtl numbers sits near the frontier between a low prandtl number regime and a high prandtl number regime .",
    "a large scale circulation ( lsc ) is often present in turbulent rb convection @xcite .",
    "this `` wind '' has a complex dynamics with multistability , reversals and quiet periods .",
    "one of the oldest hypothesis to explain the puzzle at very high @xmath1 was to invoke an interplay with the lsc ( @xcite , p70 ) .",
    "we report below a few tests of the interplay between the wind and the grenoble regime .",
    "the correlation between the lsc and grenoble regime can be assessed comparing the statistics of the lsc below and above the transition . to probe the lsc , five thermometers @xcite",
    "are suspended within the flow , in the horizontal mid - plane of the _ vintage - cell_. they are evenly distributed on the circle which is equidistant from the cell axis and the sidewall ( see figure [ flo : fig - lsc-2]-b ) .",
    "temperature time series are recorded simultaneously from the five thermometers .",
    "the reynolds number associated with the lsc was determined using the auto - correlation technique . a lsc turn - over time scale @xmath87",
    "is defined imposing that the auto - correlation of one of the thermometers ( the most sensitive one was used ) has its first minimum at @xmath88 .",
    "physically , this characteristic time scale can be understood as the time of flight of the large scale temperature heterogeneities from one side of cell to the other side .",
    "the @xmath89 associated with this lsc time is then defined as :    @xmath90    figure [ flo : fig - lsc-3]-b shows @xmath81 over five decades of @xmath1 and within @xmath91 .",
    "we stress that @xmath1 and @xmath67 are varied independently , as can be seen on figure [ flo : fig - rapr - grenoble ] , which enables to fit independently the exponents of both @xmath1 and @xmath67 .",
    "the compensation chosen on the y - axis illustrates the best power law fit :    @xmath92    this fit is in agreement with other ones that have been reported in the literature at lower @xmath1 , in the hard turbulence regime ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the important result here is that this fit also remains valid in the grenoble regime . in particular , no discontinuity is detectable at the transition .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath93 based on a previous local velocity measurement at mid - height in a similar cell is also plotted on figure [ flo : fig - lsc-3 ] @xcite .",
    "the difference in magnitude and scaling between @xmath81 and @xmath93 is consistent with the differences in their definition ( e.g. @xcite ) versus @xmath94 ) can be understood easily the turn - over time scale @xmath87 is seen as the ratio of an effective lsc path length over its effective velocity . if we imagine that the effective path lengh of the lsc slightly evolves , we immediately find that @xmath81 and @xmath93 should have slightly different scalings @xcite .",
    "] this previous determination of a lsc reynolds number , as well as a third one done in trieste ( transiting ) cell @xcite also confirm that the strength of the lsc has no discontinuity when the transition occurs .    to complete the characterisation of the lsc , the statistics of its angular direction or  polarisation \" is measured . at each time step of the temperature time series ,",
    "the temperature distribution along the rack of five probes is fourier transformed versus angular position .",
    "the strength and polarisation of the lsc versus time is defined from the amplitude and phase of the first fourier mode .",
    "similar multi - probe techniques has been validated to analyse the lsc in previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) . when the amplitude of the first mode is smaller than 1.3 times the rms amplitude of higher modes , we consider the lsc as undistinguishable from the background fluctuations . in this case , the lsc is considered as undefined .",
    "systematic measurements of the probability density functions ( pdf ) of the lsc polarisation are done from @xmath95 up to @xmath96 ( and @xmath97 ) .",
    "examples of such pdf are displayed on figure [ flo : fig - lsc-2]-a .",
    "no significant discontinuity of these pdf is detectable at the transition , in particular on the shapes and maximum value of the pdf .",
    "similarly , the fraction of time during which the lsc is considered as undefined remains constant ( @xmath98 ) over the whole range of @xmath1 .    as a first conclusion about the wind",
    ", we showed that the occurrence of the transition is not associated with a discontinuity in strength , scaling nor in polarisation of the lsc .",
    "one consequence is that the transition is not triggered by some instability in the dynamics of the lsc .",
    "another consequence is that the transition does not alter significantly the lsc .",
    "the conclusion above does not rule out the possibility that the transition to the grenoble regime is triggered by the lsc , in particular by its strengthening with @xmath1 . to explore how the transition depends on the lsc , we first altered it introducing some external constrains on the flow .",
    "a first test consists in tilting the _ vintage - cell _ from @xmath99 degree to @xmath100 degrees in a different direction .",
    "the set of thermometers inside the flow ( see previous subsection ) confirms that the lsc polarisation follows the new tilt direction and that its angular distribution becomes sharper when the tilt angle is larger , as shown by the pdf of figure [ flo : fig - lsc-2]-a . below the transition , increasing tilt reduces heat transfer by 2% , consistently with other experiments with the same aspect ratio @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the heat transfer is unchanged in the grenoble regime .",
    "this robustness of the heat transfer to a tilt increase ( and to a more pronounced polarisation of the lsc ) is a new signature of the grenoble regime .",
    "is the transition triggered by the shearing of the boundary layers by the lsc ? in section [ prsubsec ] , we reported some indirect evidence that it was not the case .",
    "we performed here a more direct test of this mechanism by breaking the lsc with screens to see if the transition was disfavoured .",
    "similar tests have been performed in the past to explore the role of the lsc on the hard turbulence regime @xcite .",
    "four croissant - shape thin horizontal plastic screens are evenly distributed along the height of the _ screen - cell _ ( see figure [ flo : fig - lsc-1]-b / c ) .",
    "the angular distribution of screens is helicoidal , with a 90 degree angle between consecutive ones .",
    "the surface of each screen equals 33.3% of the cell cross - section .",
    "figure [ flo : fig - lsc-1]-a presents heat transfer measurements in this cell and in a similar cell without screens but with a residual tilt of 1.3 degree to break the axisymmetry ( _ vintage - cell _ ) .",
    "the measurement have been performed for five sets of mean temperature and mean density conditions : this allows a one - by - one comparison of the experiments independently of the fluid properties .    within accuracy ,",
    "the transition occurs for the same threshold @xmath1 as can be seen for the dataset at @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this suggests that the transition to the grenoble regime in aspect ratio @xmath103 cells is not triggered by the lsc .",
    "this is the main result of this specific experimental study .",
    "additionally , over two decades of @xmath1 above the transition , the heat transfer of both experiments are within 6% .",
    "thus , a strong alteration of the lsc has a limited effect on heat transfer efficiency in the grenoble regime in this range of @xmath1 and @xmath67 .",
    "finally , a third indication of the limited influence of the lsc on the transition threshold is provided by the @xmath104 _ cigar - cell_. as shown on figure [ cigare ] , the heat transfer is multi - valued around @xmath105 with @xmath106 difference in @xmath2 for a given @xmath1 . in such an elongated cell , the lsc can be organized in one or several rolls on top of each other .",
    "we interpret the bi - valued @xmath2 as a signature of transition from one lsc configuration to another one .",
    "a similar effect has been reported in the past with few % difference on @xmath2 in a @xmath107 cell , which was interpreted as the first evidence of the multistability of the lsc in turbulent convection @xcite .",
    "the transition to the grenoble regime happens to occur in the window where @xmath2 is multivalued , giving the opportunity to compare the transition for both configurations of the lsc . within resolution",
    ", the transition occurs for the same @xmath1 and is as steep for the two mean flows .    to conclude this section , we first recall that the heat transfer in the hard turbulence regime is hardly altered by changes of the lsc .",
    "in particular , it well known that a cell tilting or the presence of screens inside the cell motly result in a change of the prefactor of the @xmath3 scaling . in this section",
    ", we found that this properties is also satisfied in the grenoble regime .",
    "a second and more surprising conclusion is that the transition to the grenoble regime is not directly triggered by lsc for @xmath67 of order unity , contrary to what is often assumed in the literature since 2001 when discussing the transition mechanism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ flo : fig - gamma]-a presents the local scaling exponent of @xmath3 in cells with aspect ratios @xmath24 ( _ short - cell _ ) , @xmath103 ( _ vintage _ and _ flange _ cells ) and @xmath108 _ cigar - cell_. all these cells have the same diameter @xmath109 , their sidewalls are made of the same material ( @xmath110 thick stainless steel ) and the fluid prandtl number is the same ( @xmath111 ) within @xmath112 .",
    "an arbitrary threshold exponent 0.35 is used to define a transition rayleigh number @xmath113 for each cell and this quantity is plotted versus @xmath114 on figure [ flo : fig - gamma]-b .",
    "we find a strong @xmath115 dependence , fittable as @xmath116 ( solid line ) but remains also compatible with a @xmath117 dependence ( blue dash line ) .",
    "the @xmath118 scaling can be interpreted stating that the transition occurs when a flow length scale that is proportional to the cell height @xmath17 reaches a constant scale found in the 4 cells . what is this fixed length scale ?",
    "a first hypothesis is that this fixed scale is set by defects of the plates surface .",
    "systematic roughness and flatness / wavyness characterisations have been performed on all the plates ever operated in grenoble .",
    "we found that the characteristic scales of these defects ( see section [ sectionmanip ] ) is much smaller than the thermal boundary layer thickness @xmath119 at the transition .",
    "moreover , among cells with the same height , we did nt find any correlation between the transition @xmath1 and the plates roughness although some were 5 times rougher than others .",
    "finally , we note that the oregon and trieste cells are made with the same plates : if a plate defect was causing the transition , the oregon cell should have transited . rejecting this first hypothesis",
    ", we retain the most obvious common length scale shared by the 4 cells : the cells diameter @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath118 scaling can then be reformulated stating that the transition occurs when the rayleigh number based on @xmath109 ( instead of @xmath17 ) reaches a critical value , at least as first approximation and within the limited range of aspect ratios @xmath120 .",
    "surely , this properties associated with the lateral confinement is not expected to extrapolate to aspect ratio much larger than unity .",
    "we found that confinement by sidewalls disfavours the transition .",
    "is this confinement effect purely geometrical ( presence of fixed lateral boundaries ) or is it also coupled to the thermal properties of the sidewall ? to explore this possibility ,",
    "the thermal properties of the sidewall have been altered in three ways :    1 .   _ paper - cell _ : three layers of smooth paper has been rolled against a @xmath121-thick stainless steel sidewall .",
    "this results in an increases of the sidewall roughness , a @xmath122-thick thermal insulation between the flow and the stainless steel sidewall and an extra thermal inertia attached to the sidewall ( the inertia of the he trapped in the paper is few tens of times larger than the inertia of the stainless steel ) .",
    "2 .   _ thickwall - cell _ : the sidewall has been made roughly 4.4 times thicker to increase the sidewall spurious thermal effects 3 .",
    "_ cornerflow - cell _ : a tunable heating ( respectively cooling ) ring have been installed on the outer side of the sidewall , near the bottom plate ( respectively top plate ) connection .",
    "this enable to force more or less the corner flows expected at the plate - sidewall angle .",
    "an isolated heater was also varnished on the external side of the sidewall , @xmath123 above the bottom plate .",
    "this heater enables to break the symmetry of the sidewall .",
    "the experiments ii ) and iii ) have been described in a conference proceeding @xcite .",
    "it was found that these alterations of the sidewall have a very limited impact on the transitional @xmath1 and on the strength of the transition ( the @xmath3 data of the _ thickwall - cell _ appears on figure [ flo : fig - exposants ] ) .",
    "the _ paper - cell _ experiment is more surprising : as illustrated on figure [ flo : fig - exposants ] , the local exponent of @xmath3 increases more slowly with @xmath1 than for the other cells , and the transition seems to occur at slightly higher @xmath1 .",
    "we have no understanding why the paper layers have such a strong effect on the steepness of the transition , but this results suggests that a thermal interaction between the sidewall and the flow can significantly alter the transition .    as a conclusion on this section",
    ", the transition seems significantly disfavoured by the lateral confinement of the sidewall .",
    "a practical consequence is that the transition is not easier to observe in elongated cells , because it occurs at higher @xmath1 .",
    "we found that the transitional @xmath1 and the transition sharpness can significantly vary from one cell to another depending on the sidewall properties .",
    "this observation raises issues on the modelling of sidewall in very high @xmath1 simulations .",
    "over the last 14 years , the grenoble regime has been characterized in various ways .",
    "we summarize the main observed features and discuss them in connection with kraichnan s prediction .    1 .",
    "* the @xmath3 scaling*. + kraichnan predicted the following heat transfer law : @xmath124 + we omit a @xmath67-dependent prefactor of the numerator because the @xmath67 dependence of the denominator is not considered in the model",
    ". a precise quantitative comparison of ( [ eqkraichnan ] ) with the measurements is difficult to justify because this equation is only valid for asymptotic large @xmath1 ( _ a - priori _ ) , as kraichnan insists .",
    "nevertheless , this equation sets bounds on the local scaling exponent of @xmath3 in the region joining the two regimes .",
    "indeed , we expected this exponent to be larger than 1/3 ( hard turbulence regime ) and lower than 0.5 ( asymptotic exponent of ( [ eqkraichnan ] ) ) .",
    "this window of exponents is consistent with the exponents observed in the grenoble regime ( see figure [ flo : fig - exposants ] ) .",
    "+ a more quantitative test of the @xmath3 scaling is nevertheless possible .",
    "indeed , in the framework of the kraichnan model , the boundary layer theory predicts that the denominator in ( [ eqkraichnan ] ) should be replaced by a constant if the plates are rough or corrugated .",
    "this test was performed ( _ corrugated - cell _ ) and a pure @xmath125 scaling was observed @xcite .",
    "* evidence of a boundary layer instability*. analysing the shot noise generated by thermal plumes in the bottom plate , it was found that the grenoble transition is indeed associated with an instability localized in the boundary layer @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the occurrence of kraichnan s regime , which is characterized by a laminar - to - turbulent transition of the velocity boundary layers laying over the heating and cooling plates .",
    "* transition on the fluid s temperature fluctuations*. non - invasive measurements within the boundary layers are very delicate due to its small thickness . a direct test of the turbulent state of the boundary layer is therefore difficult .",
    "nevertheless it was found that the temperature fluctuations right above the bottom boundary layer do experience a change of statistics when the transition occurs @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "[ weaklsc ] * weak influence of large scale circulation * ( lsc ) . in section [ sectionsidewall",
    "] , we found that breaking the lsc with screens have a limited impact on the heat transfer , although the lsc must have been significantly altered .",
    "similarly , the transitions to the grenoble regime had similar characteristics when occurring on two different configurations of the lsc in the _ cigar cell_. an increased tilt of the convection cell resulted in a better clamping of the lsc polarisation but did not result in lower @xmath2 as found in the hard turbulence regime .",
    "+ finally , in section [ sectionpr ] , we found that the transition was not occurring for a fixed value of the lsc reynolds number , at least for @xmath126 .",
    "the addition of all these observations clearly indicates that the lsc alone is not a transition trigger , as often is assumed in the literature .",
    "once the transition has occurred , we find that the heat transfer is robust to alterations of the lsc , such modifications resulting mostly in new prefactors ( of order 1 ) for the @xmath3 law",
    "the transition @xmath1*. the transition @xmath1 is found typically between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "cell diameter and sidewall material given , the transition @xmath1 was found to scale like @xmath129 for aspect ratios within 0.23 - 1.14 .",
    "thus , in this range , the transition rayleigh number based on the cell diameter ( instead of @xmath17 ) is nearly constant .",
    "this properties of confined cells is not expected to hold for aspect ratio much larger than unity .",
    "+ in kraichnan s model , the transition occurs when the eddies located in the bulk of the flow shear the velocity boundary layers beyond their stability point . as argued in @xcite , a transition at @xmath130",
    "would be compatible with a boundary layer instability that would originate from the shearing by the lsc .",
    "following this idea , various estimates based on different hypotheses suggest that any transition occurring in the window @xmath131 ( for @xmath132 ) would also be compatible with kraichnan s model ( e.g. see @xcite ) . unfortunately , we found that the transition can not be simply triggered by the lsc .",
    "these estimations for the transition @xmath1 should therefore be considered with much reserve .",
    "alternatively , we could speculate that the destabilizing shearing of the boundary layer is caused by the velocity fluctuations above the boundary layers .",
    "this scenario is not incompatible with the results of section [ sectionlsc ] .",
    "the small @xmath67 dependence of the transition near @xmath133 ( section [ prsubsec ] ) could result from the proximity with the low @xmath67 region .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the present results are not ruling out kraichnan s model , but they are not supporting it either .",
    "+ as a final remark possibly related to the grenoble regime , the thermal and velocity boundary layers have been characterized at intermediate @xmath1 ( where it is thick enough to be resolved ) in room temperature experiments .",
    "extrapolation of their properties over three decades of @xmath1 suggests the occurrence of a transition compatible with kraichnan s views near @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "* transition in the @xmath66 parameter space*. in section [ sectionpr ] , we showed that all @xmath23 experiments reporting a transition are localized in the same region of the @xmath66 parameters space and that nearly all the experiments without transition fall outside this region .",
    "there is no understanding of this parameter space .",
    "updating kraichnan s model using the knowledge gained over the last 50 years would certainly be highly interesting",
    "a threshold exponent 1/3 ? * for most grenoble cells , the transition seems to occur abruptly when the local exponent of @xmath3 reaches the value @xmath135 , as illustrated in figure [ flo : fig - exposants ] .",
    "reversely , the exponent @xmath135 is not reached in most of the very high @xmath1 experiments which do nt report a transition , as illustrated in figure [ flo : fig - nura - compil ] .",
    "interestingly , the exponent @xmath135 is found in the malkus model of uncoupled boundary layers @xcite .",
    "we have no interpretation for these coincidences .",
    "* thermal interaction with the sidewall*. finally , we recall that the insertion of paper layers between the stainless steel sidewall and the fluid results in a significantly less sharp transition . to the contrary ,",
    "two other changes of the sidewall thermal properties ( using a thicker wall and modifying the temperature distribution along the wall ) only had a limited effect .",
    "this result is not understood but reveals that the sidewall plays some role in the transition , as already suggested by the comparison of cells with different aspect ratios .",
    "we presented a systematic study of the convection regime reported in grenoble in 1996 , and then named _ the ultimate regime _ of convection .",
    "in particular , we characterized the conditions for the triggering of this regime . among the results",
    ", we showed that all rayleigh - bnard experiments conducted at very high @xmath1 using cryogenic helium are consistent if we assume that low @xmath67 tend to disfavour the transition in aspect ratio @xmath23 cells .",
    "we also found that the large scale circulation present in the cells does not play a key - role in triggering the transition , contrary to a common assumption .",
    "reversely , we found that the sidewall has an unexpected effect on this transition .",
    "several evidences suggest that grenoble s regime corresponds to kraichnan s prediction and no experimental fact seems incompatible with such an interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , the conditions for the triggering of this regime are obscure and sometimes surprising . besides",
    ", a few experimental facts can not be directly explained using the genuine kraichnan model .",
    "further experimental investigations are clearly needed .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the kraichnan regime is the only elaborated model available to interpret the grenoble regime .",
    "alternative scenarios of boundary layer instability probably deserve to be explored , aside kraichnan s paradigm or in a complementary fashion .",
    "we hope that the results presented in this work will set useful bounds for such alternative models .",
    "we thank b. castaing , f. chill , r. du puits , b. hbral and b. chabaud for scientific discussions and support .",
    "we acknowledge the laboratory cryogenic staff , and in particular g. garde , for providing us with most of the convection cells presented in this work .",
    "we do nt forget v. arp who kindly shared us with some helium properties fits , and the students r. bois , j. muzellier and e. waites who contributed at some point to these investigations .",
    "we report here two systematic and complementary studies of non - boussinesq deviations at very high @xmath1 .",
    "an experimental study explores the validity of the  constant fluid properties \" approximation @xcite , while the theoretical study addresses the validity of all the other approximations required to obtain boussinesq s set of equations @xcite .",
    "the `` constant fluid properties '' approximation in the context of very high @xmath1 convection has already been discussed in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .      in given experimental conditions ,",
    "the variations of the different fluid properties across the cell occur simultaneously .",
    "it is therefore convenient to parametrize them with single parameter .",
    "a convenient one is the first - order - approximation of the density variation , @xmath136 .",
    "a more stringent parameter @xmath137 is the maximum deviation among the five parameters coming into the definition of @xmath1 , @xmath67 and @xmath2 : the density @xmath69 , the thermal expansion @xmath13 , the molecular conductivity @xmath138 , the isobaric heat capacity @xmath139 and the viscosity @xmath140 . in practice ,",
    "we defined it as @xmath141 where @xmath142 and where the indices @xmath143 and @xmath144 represents the top and bottom boundary layers . using these two non - boussinesq parameters , we now compare the datasets of the _ flange - cell _ , trieste @xmath145 and oregon experiments . among our cells , the _ flange - cell _ is chosen because it benefited of the most extensively exploration of the parameter space .",
    "all three cells used the same fluid and therefore they are expected to experience somehow similar variation of fluid properties .",
    "we recall that the oregon cell does nt transit at very high @xmath1 contrary to the two others .",
    "( stars ) experiments .",
    "the non - boussinesq parameter is defined in the text . ]",
    "figure [ flo : fig - boussi-1 ] shows the non - boussinesq parameters @xmath146 ( y - axis ) and @xmath137 ( color code ) for the three experiments . at first , for any given @xmath1 , the non - boussinesq deviations in grenoble 20-cm - high cell can be significantly smaller than the corresponding deviations in trieste 50-cm - high cell , and at least as good as the 100-cm - high cell of oregon .",
    "this contradicts a widespread idea that larger cells are necessarily `` more '' boussinesq for a given @xmath1 .",
    "more interesting , for a given @xmath1 , the non - boussinesq parameter @xmath146 of the grenoble experiment is varied over up to 1.5 decade , reaching values equal or above the ones reached in the oregon cell . at @xmath96 ( for example ) , the non - boussinesq parameters @xmath146 and @xmath137 are close to 2% in the oregon experiment .",
    "at the same @xmath1 , these parameters are spanning a range from 1% up to nearly 30% in grenoble s cell .",
    "over all this range of non - boussinesq parameters , grenoble ultimate regime is present in grenoble experiment but not in the oregon one .",
    "this shows that the non - boussinesq deviations associated to fluid properties variations can not cause the qualitative difference between these two experiments .",
    "figure [ figboussi23](a ) shows the local scaling exponent of @xmath3 in grenoble cell for two @xmath1 : below and above the transition .",
    "each exponent was fitted manually using the subsets of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) data obtained at constant mean density and mean temperature .",
    "for these two specific @xmath1 , the non - boussinesq parameter @xmath146 varies over more than one decade without causing any noticeable change of scaling exponent .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the grenoble regime is clearly evidenced with a non - boussinesq parameter @xmath146 smaller than 1% .",
    "boussinesq s approximation does nt only consist in neglecting variation of fluid properties and modelling at first order the buoyant term .",
    "it also requires a decoupling of the heat balance equation with the flow mechanical energy .",
    "for example , the heating produced by viscous dissipation and temperature fluctuations induced by pressure fluctuations are neglected in this approximation . in his famous book @xcite ,",
    "d. j. tritton discusses in details the applicability of this approximation at low @xmath1 , where gradient and time derivatives can be estimated using integral length and time scales @xmath17 and @xmath147 . in the turbulent regimes , these gradients could a - priori become significantly larger due the smaller characteristic scales and tritton s criteria are no longer useful . using the present knowledge of scaling laws in turbulent convection , we derived a set of criteria for the applicability of boussinesq s approximation in a fluid with constant properties and @xmath67 of order @xmath148 .",
    "details of the derivation are given in @xcite .",
    "the result is a set of four criteria :    @xmath149    where @xmath150 is a dimensionless estimation of the temperature fluctuations in the bulk of the flow and @xmath151 is an estimation of its associated time derivative @xmath152 .",
    "the adiabatic gradient @xmath153 the compressibility @xmath154 , the heat capacities ratio @xmath155 and the mean temperature @xmath156 are related by :    @xmath157    physically , the first criterion is required for incompressibility in the boundary layer and it was considered in the first part of this appendix . the second criterion allows to neglect variations of density due to the pressure variations , versus those due to temperature variations .",
    "it also allows to neglect the cooling / heating associated with the pressure variations experienced by a fluid particle in the heat transport equation .",
    "the two other criteria , indirectly associated with the stratification in the cell , result from various physical contributions . using fits for @xmath89 , @xmath2 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 ,",
    "the four criteria above become :    @xmath158 & \\ll1\\\\ \\left(\\case{\\delta_{h}^{2}}{t_{0}\\delta}\\right)&\\times&0.1ra^{0.1}pr^{0.25 } & \\ll1\\end{array}\\right.$ ]    our main interest is to see if a violation of the criteria # 2 , # 3 or # 4 is correlated with the occurence / inhibition of the transition to the grenoble regime .",
    "we find that up to @xmath159 , the oregon and grenoble _ he _ experiments fullfil the last three criteria provided that the first one is fulfilled @xcite . , the criteria # 2 is violated in the oregon experiment .",
    "a side consequence is that increasing the height of _ he _ cell beyond @xmath160 will only allow to increase the maximum @xmath1 ( within boussinesq conditions ) like @xmath161 and not @xmath162 .",
    "] as a conclusion , the type of non - boussinesq deviation considered in this subsection can not explain the puzzle at very high-@xmath1 .",
    "the convection literature repeatily states that the cryogenic _ he _ experiment are performed `` close to the critical point '' and suggest that some unknown critical point artefacts could somehow alter heat transfer measurements at very high @xmath1 .",
    "firstly , we note that no precise statement along this line has ever been published .    secondly , this hypothesis has been discussed in @xcite comparing the datasets of chavanne @xcite , oregon @xcite and chicago @xcite .",
    "the conclusion was that proximity to the liquid - vapor coexistence curve can not cause the difference in heat transfer .    a third argument",
    "can be raised using the _ flange - cell _ datasets .",
    "the `` distance '' to the critical point ( @xmath163@xmath164 ) can be assessed quantitatively using the reduced temperature @xmath165 and reduced density @xmath166 it is well known that critical point divergence phenomena becomes significant when both reduced parameters are significantly smaller than unity . in @xcite for example , the reduced temperature is made smaller than @xmath167 to experience compressibility effect . on the other hand , the reduced temperature and density of water in traditional convection experiments are about 0.5 and 2 , and one can safely consider these experiments as far away from the critical point . for @xmath168 ,",
    "the reduced density in the oregon cell is about 0.9 ( that is @xmath169 ) : undoubtly a critical point artefact can not explain the absence of transition in this cell . in the grenoble _ flange _ cell ,",
    "the transition was evidenced for reduced temperatures up to 1.2 ( @xmath170 ) and a reduced density close to 0.7 ( @xmath171 ) , as shown on figure [ figboussi23](b ) .",
