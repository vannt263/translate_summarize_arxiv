    "it is widely known that on the computation of the non - linear perturbations generated during inflation we encounter the divergence coming from the infrared ( ir ) corrections  @xcite .",
    "as the possibility of detecting the non - linear primordial perturbations is increasing  @xcite @xcite , it becomes more important to solve the ir divergence problem for the primordial perturbations and to predict their finite amplitude that we observe  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we have proposed one way to solve this ir divergence problem in the single - field inflation model .",
    "the key observation is that the variables that are commonly used in describing fluctuations are influenced by what we can not observe .",
    "this is because we can observe only the fluctuations within the region causally connected to us .",
    "we usually define the fluctuation by the deviation from the background value which is the spatial average over the whole universe .",
    "however , since we can observe only a finite volume of the universe , the fluctuations evaluated in such a way are inevitably influenced by the information contained in the unobservable region . in general , the deviation from the global average is much larger than the deviation from the local average , which leads to the over - estimation of the fluctuations due to the contribution from long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "in addition to that , to discuss the so - called observable quantities in the framework of the standard cosmological perturbation ( even though people call it gauge invariant formulation ) , in practice it is necessary to fix the gauge , say , the flat gauge . as long as the gauge is determined by solving elliptic - type equations on each constant time slice , the gauge choice is inevitably affected by the information in the region causally disconnected to us .",
    "gauge dependence of the perturbation variables itself is not a problem since the `` true observables '' such as the statistical property of the sky map of the temperature fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background are not affected by the gauge choice .",
    "however , if divergences appear in the quantities computed at the intermediate steps such as @xmath0-point functions of the perturbation fields , it becomes almost impossible to extract information about the `` true observables '' from them .",
    "to shut off the influence from the unobservable region of the universe , we focused on the presence of residual gauge degrees of freedom in flat gauge . to remove the harmful part in the residual gauge degrees of freedom , we imposed a further gauge condition which insists the local average of the inflaton to vanish .",
    "then , the fluctuation is not influenced by the information from the causally disconnected region .",
    "we gave a proof that ir divergences are absent in this new scheme .",
    "in this paper , we extend our discussion to the multi - field models . since the adjustment of the average value is possible only for one field , even if we adopt the local gauge , the fluctuations of the other components of the scalar fields @xmath1 are still influenced by the causally disconnected region . here",
    "we denote the index for the d - component scalar fields by @xmath2 . reflecting this fact ,",
    "when plural fields are associated with the ir divergences , the prescription presented in our previous paper  @xcite is not enough to regularize ir divergences . to remove the influence from what we can not observe , we introduce new perturbation variables from which we can compute the `` true observables '' .",
    "as the new variables , we consider the local perturbations of the fields defined by the deviation from their local average values .",
    "then , we prove the regularity of @xmath0-point functions of these new variables .",
    "we should note that @xmath0-point functions for the local perturbations are still influenced by what we can not observe .",
    "this is due to the difference between the quantum state of the universe which we set as a natural initial condition and the one which we observe in our real universe .",
    "the natural wave function of the inflationary universe is not peaked at a specific point in the space of the local average values of @xmath1 . at the observation time , this `` natural '' state of the universe can be decomposed into a superposition of wave packets which have a peak at a certain point . as the universe evolves , constituent wave packets lose correlation to each other . through this so - called decoherence process ,",
    "the coherent superposition of the wave packets starts to behave as a statistical ensemble of many different worlds , where each world means the universe described by a decohered wave packet  @xcite .",
    "our observed world is just a representative one expressed by a wave packet randomly chosen from the various possibilities .",
    "once we select one wave packet after the decoherence occurs , the evolution of our world will not be affected by the other parallel worlds .",
    "however , the initial quantum state does include the contributions from all the wave packets .",
    "this implies that a naive computation of @xmath0-point functions is contaminated by the other worlds uncorrelated to ours . in this paper , taking into account the decoherence of the quantum state of the universe , we propose a way to define `` observables '' and show that they are actually finite without suffering from ir divergence .",
    "however , to be honest , the `` observables '' that we introduce do not correspond exactly to what we measure in the actual observations . not to mislead the reader ,",
    "we should stress here that our definition of `` observables '' does not respect the aspect explained in the preceding paragraph in a completely satisfactory manner .",
    "they are not the expectation values for a single decohered wave packet .",
    "what we define is not completely free from the contamination of the other worlds decohered from ours .",
    "however , since we define our `` observables '' so as to over - estimate the amplitude of fluctuations , the proof of their finiteness ensures the finiteness of what we really observe . recently the stochastic approach  @xcite has been employed in order to solve the ir divergence problem  @xcite .",
    "this is in harmony with our claim . in stochastic approach",
    ", we assume that the modes that exceed a certain length scale are automatically decohered  @xcite .",
    "namely , long - wavelength fluctuations are treated as the statistical variance . since our unique `` world '' is one realization in this statistical ensemble , there is no contribution to the observed quantum fluctuations from long - wavelength modes by definition .",
    "this is a practical way to take into account the quantum decoherence in the inflationary universe , but this scheme can not completely remove the artificial ir cut - off scale from the discussion .",
    "moreover , it is hard to deny the spiteful criticism that the reason why the problem of ir divergence does not appear in the stochastic approach might be simply because quantum fluctuations in the ir limit are neglected by hand .",
    "in contrast , in our approach , to avoid under - estimating the amplitude of fluctuations , we accepted small contamination from the other parallel worlds , which will make the amplitude of fluctuations larger .",
    "namely , sacrificing the accuracy of the estimate of the amplitude of fluctuations , we choose to show the ir regularity of the observables by over - estimating the amplitude of fluctuations .",

    "[ requirement ] , we give the set up of our problems .",

    "however , in this subsection we show that a naive computation of the correlation functions does not give the correlation functions that we actually observe .",
    "when there is no isocurvature mode related to ir divergence , making use of the gauge degree of freedom , we can arrange that the adiabatic perturbation variable @xmath118 to be the deviation from the local average value .",
    "in contrast , there is no such gauge degree of freedom for the isocurvature perturbation @xmath119 hence , we have to use the isocurvature perturbation variables defined by the deviation from the average values on a whole time slice , which contains information of the causally disconnected region . as observable isocurvature perturbation , we introduce the local fields , @xmath120 however , even if we restrict our attention to the local quantity @xmath121 on the final surface , the variables @xmath122 which contains the information outside the causal region appear in describing time evolution of the field .",
    "although in our previous work we have stressed that the locality of the observables is the key issue in order to assure the ir regularity , the locality is inevitably violated under the presence of ir divergence originating from isocurvature perturbation .",
    "here we need to raise another key issue , i.e. the quantum decoherence .",
    "the primordial perturbations are expected to decohere through the cosmic expansion and/or through various interactions  @xcite .",
    "this decoherence process transmutes the quantum fluctuations at a long wavelength to statistical variances  @xcite . at the initial time when the wavelength of relevant modes is short",
    ", the adiabatic vacuum state will be a natural vacuum state .",
    "however , the adiabatic vacuum state is not a wave packet sharply peaked around a specific value of the homogeneous part of the scalar field @xmath123 .",
    "instead , it is infinitely broad and can be interpreted as a coherent superposition of peaked wave packets .",
    "( detailed explanation will be given in ",
    "[ bogoliubov ] below . ) in the early stage of inflation these wave - packets correlate to each other , but the quantum coherence is gradually lost in the course of time evolution .",
    "thus , at the observation time ( @xmath124 ) the coherence will remain only between adjacent overlapping wave packets .",
    "our observed world is corresponding to one decohered wave packet picked up from this superposition .",
    "for the later time evolution of our world , we can completely neglect the other wave packets whose peak is located very far from ours in the space of isocurvature components of the local average values of fields @xmath125 .",
    "hence , keeping the superposition of all wave packets as the wave function of the universe gives rather misleading results , i.e. huge over - estimates of quantum fluctuations .",
    "we should therefore remove the contributions from the other worlds .",
    "it is standard to discuss the decoherence process by coarse - graining some degrees of freedom in the quantum interacting system , by which the reduced density matrix evolves from its initial pure state to a mixed state .",
    "this process is interpreted as the transition from the initial coherent superposition of many different worlds to the final statistical ensemble of them . in @xcite ,",
    "the decoherence process of the long wavelength modes is treated by using the stochastic approach to inflation , in which all the quantum fluctuations of long wavelength modes are assumed to turn into the variance of classical ensemble at each time step .",
    "this assumption of complete classicalization can be justified to some extent by coarse - graining the short wavelength modes .",
    "on physical ground , we believe that this approach gives a good approximate description of the dynamics of inflation .",
    "@xcite however , here we take a different approach because in the stochastic approach , by assumption , the quantum fluctuations of long wavelength modes , which we focus on in the present paper , can not enter into the quantum loop corrections from the beginning . in this",
    "regard we think that stochastic approach is not much more satisfactory compared with a naive prescription of introducing a cutoff length scale by hand .    the accurate evaluation of what we really observe requires to elucidate the decoherence process of the primordial perturbations , which is a long - lasting and unsettled issue . here , instead",
    ", we aim at proving the ir regularity of our `` observables '' independently of the details of the decoherence process , which is the heart of this paper .",
    "although it is difficult to understand how the decoherence process proceeds until the observation time @xmath126 , it is natural to expect that the wave function of the universe has been already decohered at @xmath127 to a large extent .",
    "the observation picks up one world from the superposition of many decohered worlds .",
    "the wave function corresponding to each decohered world will have a rather sharp peak in the coordinate space of @xmath128 where @xmath129 with @xmath130 is a set of orthonormal bases in field space .",
    "hence , we insert a projection operator @xmath131 which restricts the values of @xmath132 to a small range near @xmath133 without making any significant effect on each decohered wave packet . then , the insertion of @xmath134 is expected to reduce the contamination from the other worlds significantly .    for simplicity ,",

    "we will prove the ir regularity of this @xmath0-point function in the succeeding section .",
    "now the question is how to determine the width of the projection operator , @xmath147 .",
    "( here we are assuming that @xmath148 . ) on one hand , @xmath147 must be chosen large enough to exceed the width of a decohered wave packet .",
    "naively there is a minimum size of the wave packet since a very narrow wave packet can not maintain its width for a long period of time .",
    "later , we find that the minimum size of a wave packet that we can choose is determined by the typical amplitude of quantum fluctuations generated during inflation , which is characterized by the hubble scale for a nearly massless scalar field .",
    "this amplitude is @xmath149 in terms of the fluctuation of @xmath140 .",
    "therefore we need to set @xmath147 to be larger than @xmath149 . on the other hand , in order to suppress the influence from other wave packets , @xmath147 should not be very large .",
    "later , we find that the condition that the higher order contributions are more suppressed requires @xmath147 to be much less than unity .",
    "these two conditions are compatible by choosing @xmath147 to satisfy @xmath150 .",
    "due to the inaccurate evaluation of the decohered wave packet , the effect of insertion of the gaussian projection is not equivalent to selecting our world through the actual decoherence process .",
    "hence , we can not claim that the @xmath0-point function given by eq .",
    "( [ obs npointfn ] ) is the true observable @xmath0-point function .",
    "however , the former amplitude is larger than the latter one .",
    "thus , if the @xmath0-point function given by eq .",
    "( [ obs npointfn ] ) is proved to be finite , we can conclude that the @xmath0-point function of @xmath140 evaluated for the actual decohered wave packet is also finite .    in the above discussion we assumed that the average values @xmath151 of all entropy modes has accomplished decoherence process successfully before we measure @xmath0-point functions of @xmath152 at @xmath124 .",
    "here we want to stress that whether the superposition of decohered wave packets come to be statistical ensemble or not has nothing to do with whether the mode is measurable for us or not .",
    "let s consider a hidden variable @xmath47 which interacts extremely weakly with our visible sector .",
    "even in that case , if @xmath47 represents an average of a field over a large volume , the quantum coherence between two wave packets @xmath153 and @xmath154 peaked at largely different values of @xmath47 will be lost ( at least after integrating out the other degrees of freedom in the hidden sector ) . assuming that @xmath47 takes the two discrete state @xmath153 and @xmath154 with an equal weight for simplicity , the evolved density matrix will be schematically written as @xmath155 , after integrating out the other degrees of freedom in the hidden sector . here",
    "@xmath156 and @xmath157 are the density matrices of our visible sector .",
    "( if the interaction between the hidden and visible sectors is extremely weak , @xmath156 and @xmath157 are identical . ) then , for any operator @xmath72 in our visible sector , @xmath158 .",
    "this means that , as long as the variables measurable for us are concerned , the state can be understood as a statistical ensemble composed of @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "therefore what we actually observe is the expectation value for either @xmath156 or @xmath157 .",

    "even if we consider these local perturbative variables , when plural fields have a scale invariant or red spectrum , we encounter ir divergences .",
    "this is because the effects of quantum decoherence are not taken into account yet ; the @xmath0-point function for @xmath140 is affected by the contaminations from other uncorrelated worlds . to remove the contaminations ,",
    "we have inserted the projection operator @xmath134 which projects the final quantum state to a wave packet with a sharp peak in the space of the local average values of the fields , @xmath416 . here , we give an intuitive way to understand how the insertion of the projection operator regularizes the ir corrections .",

    "in single - field models , we showed , by considering the local fluctuations , that we can suppress the secular growth which appears from the temporal integration , unless very higher order perturbation is considered .",
    "we expect that in the multi - field model , a similar suppression appears from the inserted projection operator .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "if the non - vanishing contributions from the distant past makes the amplitude of @xmath418 significantly large , they must increase also the amplitude of the local average @xmath416 to a large extent .",

    "<S> we propose one way to regularize the fluctuations generated during inflation , whose infrared ( ir ) corrections diverge logarithmically . in the case of a single field inflation model , recently , we proposed one solution to the ir divergence problem . </S>",
    "<S> there , we introduced new perturbative variables which better mimic actual observable fluctuations , and proved the regularity of correlation functions with respect to these variables . in this paper , we extend our previous discussions to a multi field inflation model . we show that , as long as we consider the case that the non - linear interaction acts for a finite duration , observable fluctuations are free from ir divergences in the multi field model , too . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the single field model , to discuss observables , we need to take into account the effects of quantum decoherence which pick up a unique history of the universe from various possibilities contained in initial quantum state set naturally in the early stage of the universe . </S>"
