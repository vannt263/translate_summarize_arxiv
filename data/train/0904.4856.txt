    "quasi - one - dimensional quantum fluids display unique properties due to the major role played by quantum fluctuations in reduced dimensionality ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in an interacting 1d bose fluid quantum fluctuations destroy the off - diagonal long - range order of the one - body density matrix ( or first - order coherence function ) , defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bosonic field annihilation operator at position  @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to its 3d counterpart , where the one - body density matrix at large distances tends to a constant which corresponds to the fraction of bose - condensed atoms  @xcite , in 1d the one - body density matrix at zero temperature decays as a power law  @xcite , the coefficient of the power law being fixed by the interaction strength : the decay is faster as the interaction strength increases from the quasi - condensate regime with a fluctuating phase  @xcite , to the tonks - girardeau regime  @xcite of impenetrable bosons .",
    "the one - body density matrix is not only a fundamental quantity as it measures the macroscopic coherence properties of a quantum fluid with bosonic statistics , but also because it is directly related ( by fourier transformation ) to the momentum distribution of the fluid . while the momentum distribution for a bose fluid is typically narrow and peaked around wavevector  @xmath5 , its specific form , its broadening due to interactions and its possible singularities give a wealth of information about the nature of the correlated fluid under study .",
    "quasi - one - dimensional bose fluids find an experimental realization in experiments with ultra - cold atomic gases confined to the minima of a 2d optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "for those systems , the momentum distribution is one of the most common observables and the one - body density matrix has been measured as well  @xcite , though not yet in the quasi-1d geometry .    from a theoretical point of view , the calculation of the one - body density matrix for the 1d interacting bose gas has a long history . in the tonks - girardeau limit where the exact many - body wavefunction is known by means of a mapping onto a gas of spinless fermions  @xcite",
    ", the problem reduces to the evaluation of a @xmath6-dimensional integral .",
    "this mathematical challenge has been addressed first by lenard  @xcite , and by several subsequent works ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the main result is the evaluation of the large - distance behavior of the one - body density matrix in the form of a series expansion , ( from  @xcite ) @xmath7 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant  @xmath8 and the coefficients have been calculated exactly . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhotg ] ) and in the following we express the one - body density matrix in units of the average particle density  @xmath9 and as a function of the scaled relative coordinate  @xmath10 .",
    "for the case of arbitrary interaction strength , the calculation of the correlation functions remains a challenge ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , although the model of bosons with contact repulsive interactions is integrable by the bethe - ansatz technique  @xcite .",
    "the power - law decay at large distances can be inferred using a harmonic - fluid approach  @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on an effective , low - energy hamiltonian describing the long - wavelength collective excitations of the fluid having a linear excitation spectrum @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting structure for the large - distance series of the one - body density matrix reads ( from  @xcite ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the universal luttinger - liquid parameter and the coefficients  @xmath14 are nonuniversal and can not be obtained by the harmonic - fluid approach . by noticing that the harmonic - fluid approach is valid also in the tonks - girardeau regime and corresponds to the case of luttinger parameter  @xmath1",

    "our approach is still effective , as it suffers from some limitations : first of all , we have just used a single - parameter regularization which neglects the details of the spectrum of the bose fluid .",
    "second , our approach relies on a hydrodynamic - like expression for the field operator  ( [ eq : psi ] ) which implicitly assumes that the fluctuations of the field  @xmath79 are `` small '' , which is not always the case . on the other hand , we see from our derivation that the corrections due to the  @xmath79 fluctuations renormalize the coefficients of the series to all orders , giving rise to the contributions in square brackets to the  @xmath98 above , but do not change the series structure .",

    "( [ eq : rhotg ] ) , dashed lines ) yields a reasonable agreement , the difference being due to the fact that we have used for the sake of illustration the explicit expression for the coefficients @xmath99 derived in the current work .",
    "it should be noted in particular that our generalized harmonic - fluid approach restores the correct trend at short distances as compared to the usual harmonic - fluid approach ( eq .  ( [ eq : rholl ] ) , dotted lines ) .",
    "it is possible to apply the above approach to the case of a 1d spinless fermi gas with odd - wave inter - particle interaction  @xcite , _ i.e. _ the 1d analog of @xmath100-wave interactions . for any value of the coupling strength the ( attractive ) fermi gas",
    "can be mapped onto a ( repulsive ) bose gas described by the lieb - liniger model with dimensionless coupling strength given by @xmath101  @xcite , the spectrum of collective excitations being the same for the two models .",
    "hence , it is possible to describe the interacting fermi gas by the luttinger - liquid hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamll ] ) as well , except for the so - called fermi - tonks - girardeau limit @xmath102 mapped onto the noninteracting bose gas limit where the collective excitation spectrum is quadratic .",
    "this allows to estimate the fermionic one - body density matrix with a method similar to the one described above for the bosons , the fermionic nature of the particles being taken into account by a jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite on the bosonic field operator  ( [ eq : psi ] ) .",
    "in particular , we generalize the series expansion known from the usual harmonic - fluid approach , which in rescaled units reads ( from  @xcite ) @xmath103 to the following series structure : @xmath104.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhofgll ] ) are nonuniversal and need a separate treatment . the limit  @xmath1 is an exception though .",
    "it corresponds to the case of noninteracting fermions where the exact result for the one - body density matrix @xmath105 , with  @xmath106 being the single - particle orbitals , in the thermodynamic limit and in rescaled units reads @xmath107 hence , it turns out that for noninteracting fermions all the coefficients of the series expression  ( [ eq : rhofgll ] ) vanish except the leading one .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a generalized harmonic - fluid approximation and applied it to evaluate the large - distance behavior of the one - body density matrix both for one - dimensional interacting bosons and fermions at arbitrary values of the interaction strength ",
