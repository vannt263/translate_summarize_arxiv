    "particle - antiparticle mixing has always been of fundamental importance in testing the standard model and constraining new physics .",
    "this is because mixing is responsible for the small mass differences between the mass eigenstates of neutral mesons .",
    "being a flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process , it often involves heavy quarks in loops .",
    "such higher order processes are of great interest since the amplitudes are sensitive to any weakly - coupling quark flavor running around the loop .",
    "historically , @xmath1 mixing is the rare ( fcnc ) process that has been experimentally examined in the greatest detail .",
    "it has been amply demonstrated that in spite of many inherent uncertainties of strong interaction physics , the standard model predicts the correct phenomenology of the @xmath1 mixing .",
    "in fact , based on the calculation of the @xmath2 - @xmath3 mass difference , gaillard and lee  @xcite were able to estimate the value of the charm quark mass before the discovery of charm .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 mixing gave the first indication of a large top quark mass .",
    "although @xmath0 mixing is very similar to @xmath1 and @xmath4 mixing , as all are fcnc processes , there are significant differences which make @xmath0 mixing a possible unique place to explore new physics . roughly speaking , in the case of @xmath5 and @xmath6 fcnc processes , the appearance of the top quark in the internal loop with @xmath7 removes the gim  @xcite suppression , making @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays a nice place to test fcnc transitions and to study the physics of the top . in the case of @xmath8 fcnc processes ,",
    "the fcnc are much stronger suppressed because the down - type quarks ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 enter the internal loops and the gim mechanism is much more effective  @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath16 mixing rate is expected to be small in the standard model , which means the mixing search may carry a large potential for discovery of new physics .",
    "there are many extensions of the standard model which allow @xmath16 mixing ( the mass difference between the two cp eigenstates ) to be significantly larger than the standard model prediction ( for example , see  @xcite to  @xcite ) .",
    "recent reviews on fcnc processes in @xmath8 decays can be found elsewhere  @xcite . in general",
    ", there could be a large enhancement of the one - loop induced fcnc processes in @xmath8 decays with no constraint from limits on fcnc processes in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 systems . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is because the couplings of fcnc to up - type quarks ( @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 ) could be completely different from those to down - type quarks ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) .",
    "thus one gains independent pieces of information when searching for fcnc in @xmath8 decays , compared to what is learned searching for fcnc in @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays .",
    "one can characterize @xmath0 mixing in terms of two dimensionless variables : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xmath27 being the masses and decay rates of the two cp ( even and odd ) eigenstates . assuming a small mixing , namely , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 .",
    "mixing can be caused either by @xmath31 ( meaning that mixing is genuinely caused by the @xmath32 transition ) or by @xmath33 ( meaning mixing is caused by the fact that the fast decaying component quickly disappears , leaving the slow decaying component which is a mixture of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations of @xmath0 mixing in the standard model are plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "while short distance effects from box diagrams are known  @xcite to give a negligible contribution ( @xmath36 ) , the long distance effects from second - order weak interactions with mesonic intermediate states may give a much larger contribution .",
    "estimates of @xmath37 from long distance effects range from @xmath38 to @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been argued by georgi and others that the long distance contributions are smaller than previously estimated , implying that cancellations occur between contributions from different classes of intermediate mesonic states  @xcite . while many people now believe that within the standard model",
    "@xmath40  @xcite , others think @xmath37 could be much larger  @xcite , say @xmath41  @xcite ( meaning both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are above @xmath39 ) .",
    "for example , bigi  @xcite pointed out that observing a non - vanishing value for @xmath37 between @xmath41 and @xmath39 would at present not constitute irrefutable evidence for new physics , considering the large uncertainties in the long distance calculations .",
    "while there is some hope that the uncertainties can be reduced in the future , as pointed out by bigi  @xcite , partly through theoretical efforts and partly through more precise and comprehensive data ( since a more reliable estimate can be obtained from a dispersion relation involving the measured branching ratios for the channels common to @xmath34 and @xmath44 decays ) , one recent paper claims that the hope is rather remote  @xcite .",
    "speculations abound , but ( fortunately ) physics is an experimental science , and only with solid experimental evidence will we be able to properly address these problems . as experimentalist , i think the best way is to measure @xmath42 and @xmath43 separately , as suggested in  @xcite . as will be discussed ,",
    "this is experimentally possible .",
    "if we can measure @xmath37 as well as @xmath43 , then we can in effect measure @xmath42 . within the standard model , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "are expected to be at the same level , although we do not know exactly at what level as theoretical calculations for long distance effects ( which contribute to both @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are still plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "we expect new physics does not affect the decays in a significant way thus does not contribute to @xmath43 , but only to @xmath42 .",
    "the point i am trying to make here is that the long distance contribution can be measured , even if it can not be calculated in a reliable way ; that is , by measuring @xmath43 directly . if we can experimentally confirm that indeed @xmath45 , then we can claim new physics , regardless of what theoretical calculations for long distance effects are .",
    "otherwise , if it turns out @xmath46 , then mostly likely we are seeing the standard model physics .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to measure @xmath43 in order to understand the size of @xmath42 within the standard model .",
    "this is one of the major points i have been trying to make in the past  @xcite and in this paper .    motivated by the experience with @xmath47 system ,",
    "experimenters have been searching for @xmath48 mixing since shortly after the discovery of @xmath34 meson at spear in 1976 , in either hadronic decays @xmath49  @xcite , or semileptonic decays @xmath50 .",
    "the past decade has seen significant experimental progress in sensitivity ( from 20% to 0.37%  @xcite to  @xcite ) , as can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "the search for @xmath48 mixing has a long and interesting history ( see figure  [ history ] ) . in the first few years",
    ", people searched for @xmath51 assuming that it would be due to mixing only .",
    "normally , @xmath34 decays by cabibbo favored decay @xmath52 and @xmath53 . a signal for @xmath51 could indicate mixing of @xmath54 .",
    "but it could also indicate a different decay channel , namely , doubly cabibbo suppressed decay(dcsd ) @xmath51 , which is suppressed with respect to the cabibbo favored decay by a factor of @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "as will be discussed , around 1985 there were hints of @xmath57 observation , which could be due to dcsd or mixing .",
    "the popular interpretation neglected the possible dcsd contribution , giving the impression that @xmath48 mixing rate @xmath37 could be of order @xmath58 .",
    "this engendered much theoretical work to accommodate the possibly large mixing rate . at that time , the `` theoretical prejudice '' was that long - distance contributions dominated and would give a large mixing rate on the order of @xmath59 level .",
    "later on , fixed target experiments published limits which were not much larger than the nave quark model dcsd rate . in light of these results , the commonly held impression was then that dcsd was much larger than mixing , and that exploring mixing by means of hadronic @xmath34 decays had been almost exhausted as a technique since the `` annoying dcsd background '' would inherently limit ones ability to observe the interesting physics - @xmath48 mixing .",
    "it was believed by many that the signature of mixing appears only at longer decay times ; therefore , it will suffer from dcsd fluctuation , and destructive interference could wipe out the signature of mixing . since semileptonic decays are not subject to this `` annoying background '' , the general consensus was that semileptonic decays were a better avenue to explore @xmath48 mixing .",
    "however , as will be discussed in more detail later , the commonly believed `` annoying dcsd background '' does not necessary inherently limit the hadronic method as the potentially small mixing signature could show up in the interference term  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the possible differences between the resonant substructure in many dcsd and mixing decay modes could , in principle , be used to distinguish between dcsd and mixing candidates experimentally  @xcite ( the importance of the mixing - dcsd interference effect will be more clear here ) .",
    "our ability to observe the signature of a potentially small mixing signal depends on the number of @xmath60 events we will have .",
    "this means observing @xmath60 would be an important step on the way to observing mixing with this technique .",
    "recently , cleo has observed a signal for @xmath61 ( see figure 2 ) , and found @xmath62 = @xmath63 @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , without a precision vertex detector , cleo is unable to distinguish a potential mixing signal from dcsd .",
    "if the number of reconstructed charm decays can reach @xmath65 around the year 2000 , that would allow one to reach a new threshold of sensitivity to @xmath0 mixing , and perhaps actually observe it . therefore , it is time to take a detail look of all possible techniques for @xmath0 mixing search .",
    "this paper   is organized as follows : in section 2 there is a review of the experimental techniques which can be used to search for mixing , together with some thoughts on possible new techniques . in each case",
    ", the relevant phenomenology will be briefly presented .",
    "section 3 discusses the history , present status and future prospects of searching for mixing at different experiments . in section 4 , a comparison of the future prospects of the different experiments with different techniques , in the light of the cleo ii signal for @xmath61 ,",
    "will be given .",
    "a brief summary is given in section 5 .",
    "some detailed formulae and discussions ( including possible cp violation effect ) are provided in the appendices .",
    "( 6.5,6)(0,0 ) ( -.35,-0.40 )    ( 6.5,6)(0,0 ) ( -.45,-1.25 )",
    "the techniques which can be used to search for mixing can be roughly divided into two classes : hadronic and semi - leptonic .",
    "each method has advantages and limitations , which are described below .",
    "the hadronic method is to search for the @xmath34 decays @xmath66 .",
    "these decays can occur either through @xmath0 mixing followed by cabibbo favored decay @xmath67(x ) , or through dcsd @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the major complication for this method is the need to distinguish between dcsd and mixing  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic method can therefore be classified according to how dcsd and mixing are distinguished . in principle , there are at least three different ways to distinguish between dcsd and mixing candidates experimentally : ( a ) use the difference in the decay time - dependence ; ( b ) use the possible difference in the resonant substructure between dcsd and mixing events in @xmath57,@xmath68 , etc .",
    "modes ; ( c ) use the quantum statistics of the production and the decay processes .    method ( a ) requires that the @xmath34 be highly boosted and so that the decay time information can be measured .",
    "method ( b ) requires knowledge of the resonant substructure of the dcsd decays , which is unfortunately something about which we have no idea at this time .",
    "finally , method ( c ) requires that one use @xmath69 annihilation in the charm threshold region . in the following",
    ", we will discuss these three methods in some detail .",
    "this method  @xcite is to measure the decay time of the @xmath51 decay . here",
    "the @xmath34 tagging is usually done by using the decay chain @xmath70 followed by @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 from @xmath73 has a soft momentum spectrum and is referred to as `` the slow pion '' .",
    "the idea is to search for the wrong sign @xmath73 decays , where the slow pion has the same charge as the kaon arising from the @xmath34 decay .",
    "this technique utilizes the following facts : ( 1 ) dcsd and mixing have different decay time - dependence , which will be described below .",
    "( 2 ) the charge of the slow pion is correlated with the charm quantum number of the @xmath34 meson and thus can be used to tag whether a @xmath34 or @xmath35 meson was produced in the decay @xmath70 or @xmath74 .",
    "( 3 ) the small @xmath75 value of the @xmath73 decay results in a very good mass resolution in the mass difference @xmath76 and allows a @xmath73 signal to obtained with very low background .",
    "( 4 ) the right sign signal @xmath70 followed by @xmath77 can be used to provide a model - independent normalization for the mixing measurement .",
    "a pure @xmath34 state generated at @xmath78 decays to the @xmath79 state either by @xmath0 mixing or by dcsd , and the two amplitudes may interfere .",
    "the amplitude for a @xmath34 decays to @xmath79 relative to the amplitude for a @xmath34 decays to @xmath80 is given by ( see appendix a ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an unknown phase , t is measured in units of average @xmath34 lifetime .",
    "detailed discusion on the interference phase @xmath82 can be found in appendix a. here @xmath83 where @xmath84 is defined as : @xmath85 denoting the relative strength of dcsd .",
    "we have also assumed a small mixing ; namely , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , and cp conservation .",
    "detailed formulae and discussions ( including possible cp violation effect ) can be found in appendix a. in the following , we will simply discuss the basic idea of how to distinguish dcsd and mixing with this technique .",
    "the first term , which is proportional to @xmath19 , is due to mixing and the second term is due to dcsd .",
    "it is this unique attribute of the decay time - dependence of mixing which can be used to distinguish between dcsd and mixing .",
    "now we have : @xmath86 note that this form is different from what people usually use ( but equivalent ) , see appendix a. i prefer this form since it is not only more convenient for discussion here , but also much easier to be used to fit data .",
    "define @xmath87 , which describes the strength of mixing relative to dcsd .",
    "equation  [ mixing ] can then be rewritten as : @xmath88    from this equation , one may read off the following properties  @xcite : ( 1 ) the mixing term peaks at @xmath89 . ( 2 ) the interference term peaks at @xmath90 . ( 3 ) a small mixing signature can be enhanced by dcsd through interference ( with @xmath91 ) at lower decay times , compared to the case without interference ( with @xmath92 ) .",
    "the ratio between the interference term and the mixing term , denoted @xmath93 , is given by @xmath94 @xmath95 .",
    "so when @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "( 4 ) only for @xmath98 does the interference term become smaller than the mixing term . (",
    "5 ) @xmath99 happens and only happens when @xmath100 , and only at location @xmath101 .",
    "( 6 ) one can obtain a very pure dcsd sample by cutting at low decay time . while property ( 1 ) tells us that the mixing term does live at longer decay time , property ( 3 ) tells us clearly that we should not ignore the interference term .",
    "in fact , that s the last thing one wants to ignore ! ( unless we know for sure @xmath102 ) .",
    "the commonly believed `` annoying background '' , namely dcsd , could actually enhance the chance of seeing a very small mixing signal through the interference , compared to the case without the interference .",
    "in other words , the `` annoying dcsd background '' does not necessary inherently limit the hadronic method since the potentially small mixing signature could show up in the interference term . for a very small mixing rate , almost all",
    "the mixing signature could show up in the interference term , not in the mixing term , as long as @xmath103 .",
    "property ( 2 ) tells us at which location one expect to find the richest signature of a potential small mixing , which is where the interference term peaks : @xmath104 ( why should one keep worrying about long lived dcsd tails ?",
    "let s hope for @xmath103 first ) .",
    "property ( 5 ) shows that destructive interference is not necessarily a bad thing .",
    "in fact , it could provide extra information .",
    "for example , if @xmath105 , then one should find @xmath99 at @xmath101 , see figure  [ alpha ] .",
    "note this unique attribute will become more interesting in method b , see appendix b. this tells us that the destructive interference does not necessarily wipe out the signature of mixing . for the general case , interference will lead to very characteristic time distribution , as can be clearly seen in figure  [ cosphi ] .",
    "property ( 6 ) shows that we can study dcsd well without being confused by the possible mixing component .",
    "this will also become more important when we discuss method b.    therefore the signature of mixing is a deviation from a perfect exponential time distribution with the slope of @xmath106   to study the acceptance function versus decay time . ] .",
    "our ability to observe this signature depends on the number of @xmath51 events we will have .",
    "right now this is limited by the rather poor statistics .",
    "figures  [ decaytime ] or figure  [ decaytimelog ] shows each term with @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( with @xmath109 ) .",
    "it is worth to point out that the interference between mixing and dcsd also occurs in @xmath110 system . in this case",
    ", mixing is quite large and can be well measured while dcsd is small and unknown .",
    "the signature of the small dcsd would mostly show up in the interference term .",
    "but here we are not interested in measuring mixing nor measuring dcsd , what is interesting here is to measure cp violation . in appendix c",
    ", we will use @xmath111 as an example to show the basic idea .",
    "it is interesting to point out here that there is also a possibility , previously unrecognized , of using the singly cabibbo suppressed decays ( scsd ) , such as @xmath112 to study mixing  @xcite .",
    "this is because ( assuming cp conservation ) those decays occur only through the cp even eigenstate , which means the decay time distribution is a perfect exponential with the slope of @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , one can use those modes to measure @xmath113 .",
    "the mixing signature is not a deviation from a perfect exponential ( again assuming cp conservation ) , but rather a deviation of the slope from @xmath114 .",
    "since @xmath115 can be measured by using the @xmath52 decay time distribution , one can then derive @xmath116 .",
    "observation of a non - zero @xmath43 would demonstrate mixing caused by the decay rate difference ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in this case other cp even ( odd ) final states such as @xmath117 can be also used to measure @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , there is no need to tag the @xmath34 , since we only need to determine the slope .",
    "note that this method is only sensitive to mixing caused by the decay rate difference between the two eigen states , not to mixing caused by the mass difference @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "right after this technique was introduced  @xcite last summer , fermilab fixed target experiments e791 started to apply this idea to their data  @xcite .",

    "there are good reasons to believe that the resonant substructure of dcsd decay is different from that of mixing ( cabibbo favored decay , cfd ) .",
    "we can use the @xmath121 decay as an example .",
    "detail discussion about this method can be found in appendix b ( including possible cp violation effect ) , here we will just outline the basic idea .    for cfd and dcsd , the true yield density @xmath123 at a point @xmath124 in the dalitz plot can be written as : @xmath125 where @xmath126 are the relative amplitudes for each component and @xmath127 are the interference phases between each submode .",
    "@xmath128 is the s - wave three - body decay amplitude , which is assumed to be flat across the dalitz plot .",

    "@xmath127 have not been measured .",

    "just like in method a , for very small mixing , the interference term between dcsd and mixing could be the most important one .",
    "mathematically , the time - dependence of @xmath57 is the same as that of @xmath51 , the only difference is that now both @xmath141 and the interference phase @xmath82 ( between dcsd and mixing ) strongly depends on the location @xmath124 on the dalitz plot . as discussed in appendix b , the time - dependence can be written in the form  @xcite : @xmath142~e^{-t}. } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the true yield density for dcsd and cfd respectively .",
    "detailed discussion on the interference phase @xmath82 can be found in appendix b.    in principle , one can use the difference between the resonant substructure for dcsd and mixing events to distinguish mixing from dcsd .",
    "for instance , combined with method a , one can perform a multi - dimensional fit to the data by using the information on @xmath145 , @xmath146 , proper decay time @xmath19 and the yield density on dalitz plot @xmath147",
    ". the extra information on the resonant substructure will , in principle , put a much better constraint on the amount of mixing .",
    "of course , precise knowledge of the resonant substructure for dcsd is needed here and so far we do not know anything about it .",
    "because of this , for current experiments this method is more likely to be a complication rather than a better method when one tries to apply method a to @xmath121 ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) or @xmath148 . in principle",
    ", however , one can use wrong sign samples at low decay time ( which is almost pure dcsd ) to study the resonant substructure of the dcsd decays .",
    "it is interesting to point out here ( as discussed in detail in appendix b ) that the dalitz plot changes its shape as the decay time `` goes by '' due to the interference effect .",
    "note that the interference phase , unlike in the case of @xmath51 , strongly depends on the location on the dalitz plot since there are contributions from the various breit - wigner amplitudes , which changes wildly across each resonance .",
    "one would expect that @xmath149 could have any value between [ -1,1 ] , depending on the location @xmath124 .",
    "it is interesting to look at the locations on the dalitz plot where @xmath150 ( maximal destructive mixing - dcsd interference ) . as pointed out in method a , property ( 5 )",
    "tells us that one should find @xmath99 at @xmath101 .",
    "this means that the mixing - dcsd interference would dig a `` hole '' on the dalitz plot at time @xmath151 at that location . since @xmath152",
    ", the `` holes '' would show up earlier ( in decay time ) at locations where @xmath153 is smaller .",

    "the existence of the `` moving holes '' on the dalitz plot would be clear evidence for mixing .",
    "once again we see the importance of the mixing - dcsd interference effect .    in the near future",
    ", we should have a good understanding of dcsd decays and this method could become a feasible way to search for mixing ( and cp violation ) .      this method is to search for dual identical two - body hadronic decays in @xmath154 , such as @xmath155 , as was first suggested by yamamoto in his ph.d thesis  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that when @xmath0 pairs are generated in a state of odd orbital angular momentum ( such as @xmath156 ) , the dcsd contribution to identical two - body pseudo - scalar - vector ( @xmath157 ) and pseudo - scalar - pseudo - scalar ( @xmath158 ) hadronic decays ( such as @xmath155 ) cancels out , leaving only the contribution of mixing  @xcite .",

    "it is worth pointing out that there are many advantages with this method .",
    "for example , one can use cabibbo favored decay modes , such as @xmath52 , to measure the average @xmath34 decay rate @xmath114 ( which is almost a pure exponential , mixing followed by dcsd effect should be tiny , see appendix a ) .",
    "this , along with other scsd cp even ( or odd ) final states , would allow for valuable cross checks on systematics uncertainties .",
    "in addition , since we only need to determine the slope here , we do not need to tag the @xmath34 and do not have to use the events close to the primary vertex .",
    "the sensitivity of this method depends on how well we can determine the slope difference , which needs to be carefully studied .",
    "this is currently under study  @xcite . roughly speaking , in the ideal case , the sensitivity to @xmath43 would be @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the number of @xmath272 , etc . events , which means that the sensitivity to mixing caused by the decay rate difference ( @xmath273 ) would be close to @xmath274 .",

    "modes , then method b will become a feasible way to study mixing and the sensitivity should be improved .",
    "just like method a , this method requires very good vertexing capabilities and very low background around the primary vertex ( this is even more important than in method a , since precise knowledge of dcsd is very important here ) .",
    "in addition , this method requires that the detection efficiency ( for the mode being searched ) across dalitz plot be quite uniform ( at least the detector should have good acceptance on the dalitz plot at locations where dcsd and mixing resonant substructure are different ) .",
    "this is necessary so that detailed information on the resonant substructure can be obtained in every corner on the dalitz plot .",
    "the excellent photon detection capabilities will allow @xmath69 experiments to study the @xmath57 mode with very low background .",
    "from the cleo ii @xmath57 analysis  @xcite , the detection efficiency across the dalitz plot will have some variations due to cuts needed to reduce background , however , it is still good enough to obtain detailed information on the resonant substructure .",
    "future fixed target experiments may have a good chance to study @xmath260 mode , since the detection efficiency across dalitz plot should be quite flat .",
    "the sensitivity that each experiment can reach by using this method depends on many things and need to be carefully studied in the future .",
    "the sensitivity of this method depends crucially on the particle identification capabilities .",
    "since the @xmath34 is at rest , the @xmath5 and @xmath220 mesons will have the same momentum , so a doubly misidentified @xmath52 ( @xmath282 ) mimics a @xmath51 with almost the same @xmath34 mass .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that particle identification is not as crucial to method a as it is to this method ( c ) , as far as this particular background is concerned .",
    "this is because in method a , the @xmath34 is highly boosted , and doubly misidentified @xmath51 decays will have a broad distribution in the @xmath34 mass spectrum around the @xmath34 mass peak ; this background can be kinematically rejected with only a small reduction of the efficiency for the signal events .",
    "once the sensitivity reaches @xmath283 , one may have to worry about other contributions , such as contributions from continuum background , contributions from @xmath284 which can produce c - even states where dcsd can contribute  @xcite .",
    "the semi - leptonic method usually suffers from large background ( except at a @xmath222 charm factory ) , the traditional method of looking for like sign @xmath191 or @xmath192 pairs is an example .",
    "new ideas are needed in order to improve the sensitivity significantly .",
    "some promising techniques have been suggested by morrison and others at the charm 2000 workshop  @xcite and have been discussed in the working group  @xcite .",
    "the technique suggested by morrison is very similar to that of the hadronic method : one uses the decay chain @xmath285 , instead of looking for @xmath51 , one can search for @xmath286 where there is no dcsd involved .",
    "of course , due to the missing neutrino , this mode usually suffers from large background .",
    "however , for events in which the neutrino is very soft in @xmath34 rest frame , @xmath286 is quite similar to @xmath51 kinematically . in this case , one has the same advantages as @xmath285 followed by @xmath287 has .",
    "in addition , as the neutrino is soft , the proper decay time of the @xmath34 can be reasonably estimated from @xmath288 .",
    "the potential mixing signal therefore should show up as a @xmath289 term in the proper decay time distribution . to select the events with soft neutrino",
    ", one can require the @xmath288 mass above 1.4 gev .",
    "this requirement will keep about @xmath290 of the total signal .",
    "one major background here is the random slow pion background , as the effective mass difference width is still much larger ( a factor of 10 ) than @xmath285 followed by @xmath287 . in order to reduce this background ,",
    "morrison has suggested to look for a lepton with the correct charge sign in the other side of the charm decay .",
    "another background is dcsd decay @xmath51 when the @xmath218 fakes a @xmath269 , however , this background will only populates at the higher end of the @xmath288 mass spectrum where the neutrino energy is almost zero .",
    "this can be eliminated by cutting off that high end of the @xmath288 mass . in principle",
    ", this idea can be used in a fixed target experiment as well as in a @xmath69 experiment .",
    "the sensitivity of this method depends on the lepton fake rate ( meson fakes as a lepton ) .",
    "one can find some detail discussions in morrison s charm2000 workshop summary paper  @xcite .",
    "another technique , suggested by freyberger at cleo , is based on the technique which has been used by aleph , hrs and cleo to extract the number of @xmath291 events .",
    "the technique utilizes the following facts : ( 1 ) continuum production of @xmath292 events are jet like .",
    "( 2 ) the jet axis , calculated by maximizing the observed momentum projected onto an axis , approximates the @xmath73 direction .",
    "( 3 ) the @xmath291 decay is a two - body process , and the small amount of energy available means that the @xmath72 is very soft , having a transverse momentum @xmath293 relative to the @xmath73 direction which can not exceed 40 mev / c .",
    "this low transverse momentum provides the @xmath291 signature .",
    "the facts are used in the following way .",
    "the maximum momentum in the lab that the @xmath72 can have perpendicular to the line of flight of the @xmath73 is @xmath294 .",
    "one can define this quantity as @xmath295 , where @xmath296 is the angle between the @xmath73 and the @xmath72 in the lab frame , and @xmath297 is the magnitude of the @xmath72 momentum .",
    "hence , the @xmath72 from @xmath73 will populate the low @xmath298 ( or @xmath296 ) region .",
    "the signal is enhanced if one plots @xmath299 ( or @xmath300 ) instead of @xmath298 .",
    "one then looks for an lepton in the jet with the correct sign , namely , @xmath301 right sign combination and @xmath302 wrong sign combination .",
    "the signal @xmath291 followed by @xmath303 will peak in the low @xmath299 ( or @xmath300 ) region for the wrong sign events .",
    "it is worth pointing out that one can look for a lepton in the other side of the event to reduce background .",
    "there are many kinds of background to this method one has to worry about .",
    "one of the major backgrounds is fake lepton background .",
    "for example , the decay chain @xmath304 will also peak at the low @xmath299 ( or @xmath300 ) if the @xmath305 is misidentified as a @xmath269 .",
    "another major background is probably the @xmath306 dalitz and @xmath307 conversions in @xmath308 followed by @xmath309 or @xmath308 followed by @xmath310 and then @xmath311 .",
    "these two major backgrounds are at about @xmath312 level in the current cleo ii data .",
    "understanding these backgrounds is the major difficulty faced by this method .",
    "although for cleo iii , things should improve , it is not clear what kind of sensitivity one can expect from this method for future experiments .",
    "nevertheless , it is an interesting idea and worth investigating .",
    "in fact , this technique is currently under study at cleo  @xcite .",
    "the search for @xmath0 mixing carries a large discovery potential for new physics since the @xmath0 mixing rate is expected to be very small in the standard model .",
    "the past decade has seen significant experimental progress in sensitivity ( from 20% down to 0.4% ) . despite these 18 years of effort",
    "there is still much left to be done .",
    "as was discussed in the introduction , the observation of @xmath51 is an important step on the way to observing a potentially small mixing signal by using this technique . with the observation of @xmath51 signal at cleo at the level @xmath313",
    ", any experimenter can estimate the number of reconstructed @xmath51 events their data sample will have in the future and what kind of sensitivity their experiment could have .",
    "eighteen years after the search for @xmath51 started , we have finally arrived at the point where we could take advantage of possible dcsd - mixing interference to make the mixing search easier .    in light of the cleo",
    "s @xmath51 signal , if the mixing rate is close to that of dcsd ( above @xmath41 ) , then it might be observed by the year 2000 with either the hadronic or the semi - leptonic method , either at fixed target experiments , cleo iii , asymmetric b factories ( at slac and kek ) , or at a @xmath222-charm factory .",
    "if the mixing rate is indeed much smaller than dcsd , then the hadronic method may have a better chance over the semi - leptonic method .",
    "this is because the semi - leptonic method usually suffers from a large background due to the missing neutrino , while the hadronic method does not .",
    "moreover , the commonly believed `` annoying dcsd background '' does not necessary inherently limit the hadronic method as the potentially small mixing signature could show up in the interference term .",
    "the design of future experiments should focus on improving the vertexing capabilities and reducing the background level around the primary vertex , in order to fully take advantage of having the possible dcsd and mixing interference .",
    "in addition , we have learned that the very complication due to the possible differences between the resonant substructure in many dcsd and mixing decay modes @xmath60 could , in principle , be turned to advantage by providing additional information once the substructure in dcsd is understood ( the method b ) and the sensitivity could be improved significantly this way .",
    "this means that understanding dcsd in @xmath8 decays could be a very important step on the way to observe mixing .",
    "experimenters and theorists should work hard on this .    in the case of @xmath60 and @xmath314",
    ", we are only measuring @xmath30 . since many extensions of the standard model",
    "predict large @xmath20 , it is very important to measure @xmath42 and @xmath43 separately .",
    "fortunately , scsd can provide us information on @xmath43 .",
    "this is due to the fact that decays such as @xmath112 , occur only through definite cp eigenstate , and this fact can be used to measure the decay rate difference @xmath116 alone .",
    "observation of a non - zero @xmath43 would demonstrate mixing caused by the decay rate difference .",
    "this , together with the information on @xmath37 obtained from other methods , we can in effect measure @xmath42 .",
    "i should point out here that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are expected to be at the same level within the standard model , however we do not know for sure exactly at what level since theoretical calculations for the long distance contribution are still plagued by large uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it is very important to measure @xmath43 in order to understand the size of @xmath42 within the standard model , so that when @xmath48 mixing is finally observed experimentally , we will know whether we are seeing the standard model physics or new physics beyond the standard model .    in this sense , it is best to think of the quest to observe mixing ( new physics ) as a program rather than a single effort .",

    "however , in general , the interference term is not proportional to @xmath526 .",
    "therefore , one can not treat @xmath527 ( thus also @xmath260 ) exactly the same way as @xmath528 .",
    "note that since the interference term in @xmath51 and @xmath57 are totally different , one can not combine the two results to set upper limit , as e691  @xcite did to @xmath51 and @xmath260 by assuming the interference phase to be zero in both cases .    in principle , if the following inequality holds   is similar to inequality @xmath529 , which is trivial to prove . ]",
    "@xmath530 one can force @xmath531 with this definition , equation  [ time_dep_kpipi02 ] can be written in the form @xmath532~e^{-t}.\\ ] ] mathematically , equation  [ dalitz_int ] is similar to that of @xmath51 , i.e. equation  [ time_int_kpi ] .",
    "but the `` interference '' phase @xmath533 has a totally different meaning since @xmath534 strongly depends on the actual value of @xmath535 .",
    "for example , in the extreme case where for any given value of @xmath536 , if @xmath149 has an equal chance of being negative and positive ( with the same size ) , then the interference effect could be completely integrated out , leading to @xmath537 . in general , since @xmath149 can be positive and negative , the interference effect could be greatly reduced .",
    "therefore , this technique does not necessary have the advantage as in the @xmath51 time - dependent analysis",
    ".      another possible alternative would be to study the effect after integrating over decay time and also integrating over the whole dalitz plot , this is in fact what has been done at cleo  @xcite .",
    "integrating equation  [ time_dep_kpipi02_int ] over all decay times , and normalizing to the corresponding right sign samples , we get @xmath538 note the information on mixing is essentially lost due to the lack of precise knowledge on @xmath143 and @xmath149 .    again",
    "if the inequality  [ compare ] holds , equation  [ int_all ] can be written in the form @xmath539      although it is true that more - than - two body @xmath34 hadronic decays , such as @xmath57 , are very complicated due to the possible difference in the resonant substructure of the dcsd and cfd ( mixing ) decays , this unique attribute could , in principle , provide additional information which could allow one to distinguish dcsd and mixing , and to study cp violation in the future .",
    "the best way would be to perform a time - dependent dalitz analysis , that is , one can perform a multi - dimensional fit to the data by using the information on @xmath145 , @xmath540 , proper decay time @xmath19 , and the yield density on dalitz plot @xmath541 . the extra information on the resonant substructure will , in principle , put a much better constraint on the amount of mixing and cp violation . for experiments without decay time information",
    ", one could perform a time - integrated dalitz analysis . this could be a feasible way to observe mixing , but may not be a good way to measure or constrain mixing rate . with limited data size , one could in principle , perform a time - dependent non - dalitz analysis , as one",
    "would do to @xmath51 .",
    "however , care must be taken here since one can not treat multi - body decays the same as @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , since the extra information on the resonant substructure has been integrated out , the time - dependent non - dalitz analysis would not have much advantage . without decay time information and with limited data size , one could only perform a time - integrated non - dalitz analysis as has been done in  @xcite .    as one can see ,",
    "precise knowledge of the resonant substructure for dcsd is important to this technique .",
    "this means that understanding dcsd in @xmath8 decays could be a very important step on the way to observing mixing and cp violation using this technique . in principle",
    ", one can use the wrong sign sample at very low decay times ( which is almost pure dcsd ) to study the resonant substructure of the dcsd decays .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that it may be possible that a good understanding of dcsd could be reached by measuring the pattern of @xmath281 dcsd decays where the signature is not confused by a potential mixing component . in the near future",
    ", we should have a good understanding of dcsd decays and this method could become a feasible way to search for @xmath0 mixing and cp violation .",
    "as we have discussed , the interference between @xmath48 mixing and dcsd can be used to study @xmath48 mixing and cp violation .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the interference between mixing and dcsd also occurs in @xmath110 system .",
    "we will use @xmath111 as an example ( for convenience , let s also call it dcsd , as it is doubly cabibbo suppressed relative to @xmath543 ) . in this case",
    ", mixing is quite large and can be well measured while dcsd is small and unknown .",
    "the small signature of dcsd would mostly show up in the interference term .",
    "but here we are not interested in measuring mixing nor measuring dcsd , what is interesting here is to measure cp violation .        in the case of @xmath554 mixing , @xmath555 , which means we have @xmath556 .",
    "note that @xmath557 and @xmath558 , so that equation  [ btodpirate ] and  [ btodpiratebar ] becomes @xmath559~e^{-\\gamma_+ t } , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath560~e^{-\\gamma_+ t}. } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity , let us first neglect the phase difference between @xmath544 and @xmath561 caused by final state interaction .",
    "define @xmath562 with @xmath563 and @xmath564 , assuming @xmath372 , we have @xmath565",
    ".        we do not know @xmath141 for @xmath544 , but one would expect very roughly @xmath569 . note again we have neglected the phase difference between @xmath544 and @xmath561 caused by final state interaction .",
    "assuming @xmath570 ( corresponds to a maximal cp violation ) , with @xmath571 and @xmath572 , and also set @xmath573 , figure  [ btodpi_cp_sin1 ] shows the decay time dependence of equation  [ btodpirate2 ] and  [ btodpiratebar2 ] , together with each term alone .",
    "one can see that there is a sizeable interference between @xmath110 mixing and small dcsd .",
    "more importantly , there is a clear difference between @xmath574 and @xmath575 .",
    "note that the mixing term peaks at @xmath576 , where mixing is fully developed and the maximal asymmetry occurs .",
    "figure  [ btodpi_cp_sin05 ] shows the same thing , but with @xmath577 .",
    "it is interesting to take a look at the time - integrated decay rate : @xmath578,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath579.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the time - integrated asymmetry is ( with @xmath580 ) @xmath581 with @xmath571 and @xmath582 , we have @xmath583 which is quite large .",
    "similar conclusion can be made on the lepton - tagged @xmath544 on @xmath232 .",
    "of course , we have neglected the phase difference between @xmath544 and @xmath561 caused by final state interaction . in general , however , one can not ignore the phase difference and things would be more complicated .",
    "it is also worth to point out that there could be a possibility of using multi - body decays such as @xmath584 to study cp violation , similar to the case of @xmath57 where one could use the extra information on the resonant substructure .",
