    "mixed valent re@xmath11a@xmath12mno@xmath13-type manganites ( re@xmath14 and ae@xmath15 are rare earth and alkaline ions respectively ) are best known for their extraordinary sensitivity of resistivity to internal molecular and external magnetic fields.@xcite the ferromagnetic ordering of the localized t@xmath16 spins at mn@xmath14:t@xmath16e@xmath17 and mn@xmath18:t@xmath19e@xmath20 sites favors the delocalization of e@xmath21 carriers due to the double exchange interaction and , the antiferromagnetic ordering of the t@xmath19 spins favors the localization of the e@xmath21-carriers.@xcite however , the nature of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering in manganites is strongly influenced by the carrier concentration , the average ionic radius r@xmath22of the a - site cations and the orbital degree of freedom.@xcite hence , different type of antiferromagnetic configurations ( a , pseudo ce , ce , c , and g ) are found in manganites .",
    "in particular , the compound pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 received much attention due to the discovery of the first order antiferromagnetic insulator - ferromagnetic metal transition under a magnetic field.@xcite the low temperature antiferromagnetic transition was earlier thought to be of ce type , but later studies showed that it is an a - type antiferromagnet with successive ferromagnetic planes coupled antiferromagnetically@xcite .",
    "charges are itinerant within the ferromagnetic planes .",
    "the a - type antiferromagnetism in this compound is believed to be the result of the d@xmath10 orbital ordering of the mn@xmath23 ions .",
    "it was earlier interpreted that the low temperatue insulating state in zero field is charge and ce - type antiferromagnetic ordered and , the destruction of the insulating state under a magnetic field is caused by the field induced melting of charges.@xcite however , the notion of charge ordering was later discarded.@xcite presently , colossal magnetoresistance in this compound is believed to be the result of the field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition .",
    "however , it is not known whether the lattice is also affected by the magnetic field and if it is so in what manner .",
    "studying the nature of the lattice distortion under a magnetic field could shed light on the mechanism of magnetoresistance .",
    "there are only few reports on the magnetostriction effect in the three dimensional perovskite manganites@xcite .",
    "these works mostly concentrate on the compounds which have ferromagnetic metallic or insulating ground states .",
    "recently , the magnetostriction behavior of the manganites having charge and antiferromagnetic ( ce - type ) orders at low temperature was investigated.@xcite it was found that the field induced transition from the charge ordered antiferromagnetic to the charge delocalized ferromagnetic transition in nd@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 and la@xmath24ca@xmath2mno@xmath13 @xcite is accompanied by a giant positive volume magnetostriction ( i.e. the lattice volume increases under an external magnetic field ) whereas nd@xmath2ca@xmath2mno@xmath13 and some other charge ordered systems exhibit a giant negative volume magnetostriction ( i.e. , lattice volume contracts under an external magnetic field).@xcite in this context , we investigated the magnetostriction behavior of pr@xmath24sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 which is neither charge ordered nor exhibits ce type antiferromagnetism .",
    "the polycrystalline pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 sample was earlier characterized by  x - ray diffraction and zero field resistivity measurements.@xcite the room temperature structure was found to be tetragonal ( space group _ i4/mcm _ ) by neutron diffraction.@xcite we carried out magnetization m , linear thermal expansion ( @xmath25l / l ) and magnetostriction on the previously characterized sample . the temperature dependence of m at @xmath26h = 1mt was measured using a quantum design squid magnetometer .",
    "we measured the isothermal magnetization up to 12 t using a vibrating sample magnetometer .",
    "the linear thermal expansion @xmath25l / l by the strain gauge method  in absence of  a magnetic field was measured in 300 k-10 k range .",
    "the value of  @xmath25l / l at 300 k was taken as the reference point .",
    "magnetostriction isotherms were measured using a pulsed magnetic field up to @xmath26h = 14 t with the magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the measuring direction . from the measured parallel ( @xmath27 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath28 ) magnetostrictions , we calculated the volume ( @xmath1 ) and the anisotropic ( @xmath0 ) magnetostrictions for randomly oriented polycrystallites using the relations @xmath1 = @xmath29 + 2@xmath28 and @xmath30 = @xmath29-@xmath28 .",
    "the field dependence of the magnetostriction at selected temperatures was registered after zero field cooling the sample from 300 k to a desired temperature .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of m and @xmath25l / l of pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 on the left and right scales respectively .",
    "the m(t ) curve suggests that the sample first undergoes a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition ( t@xmath4 = 270 k ) and then from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with ( t@xmath9 = 100 k ) while cooling .",
    "the inflection point of the rapidly varying part of the m(t ) curve was taken as the neel temperature .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ordering was shown to be a - type.@xcite while warming t@xmath9 increases to 125 k and m(t ) exhibits hysteresis up to the curie temperature .",
    "it should be noted that m has not become zero at 10 k ( tt@xmath9 ) but exhibits a large value ( 1/5 of the maximum m(t ) while cooling and 1/2 of the maximum m(t ) while warming ) .",
    "this suggests that a fraction of the ferromagnetic phase continues to exist even below t@xmath9 .",
    "the presence of the ferromagnetic phase below t@xmath9 is also shown up in the field dependence of the magnetization to be shown later .",
    "the structural symmetry at room temperature is tetragonal and it is unaffected by the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition . however , the ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic transition is accompanied by tetragonal ( _ i4/mcm _ , @xmath31a@xmath32 x@xmath31a@xmath32x a@xmath32 ) -orthorhombic ( _ fmmm _ , 2a@xmath32 x 2a@xmath32 x 2a@xmath32 , a@xmath32 = lattice parameter of a pseudo cubic unit cell ) structural transition.@xcite the vertical dashed lines mark the coexistence of the high and low temperature phases as found by the neutron diffraction study on a similar composition.@xcite the @xmath25l / l decreases rather continuously from 300 k down to 10 k without a clear anomaly either at the curie temperature or at the neel temperature .",
    "it should be pointed here that  a clear volume contraction is observed around the neel temperature in nd@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13@xcite and la@xmath24ca@xmath2mno@xmath33@xcite and more recently even in the higher sr content compound pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13.@xcite the @xmath36l / l of pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 exhibits hysteresis over a wide temperature range ( 60 k- 270 k ) similar to the m(t ) behavior .",
    "this behavior is strikingly different from pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13 which showed hysteresis only around the neel temperature.@xcite    figure 2(a ) shows the field dependence of the magnetization at selected temperatures for t t@xmath9 and figure 2(b ) shows the m(h ) behavior above t@xmath9 .",
    "the behavior the m(h ) curve below t@xmath9 suggests the coexistence of the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "the behavior of m(h ) below @xmath26h = 2 t at 25 k is dominated by the domain wall displacement and domains alignment of the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the sudden increase of m(h ) just above @xmath26h@xmath4 = 4 t is the result of the metamagnetic transition in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "a rough value of the ferromagnetic phase fraction can be estimated as @xmath37 = @xmath38/m@xmath39 where m@xmath40 is the spontaneous magnetization and m@xmath41 is the saturation magnetization if the whole sample is ferromagnetic .",
    "the value of m@xmath40 can be determined by plotting m versus 1/h and extrapolating the linear part of the high field magnetization ( @xmath26h 2 t ) to 0 t which we found to be 0.46 @xmath42 .",
    "the value of m@xmath39 for this composition is 3.5 @xmath42 and hence y @xmath6 13 % .",
    "the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic phase increases when the sample undergoes the metamagnetic transition and finally y reaches 100 % at @xmath26h = 12 t. as t increases from 25 k , @xmath26h@xmath4 decreases from 4 t to 1.05 t at 100 k. the size of the ferromagnetic phase in the antiferromagnetic host appears to be dependent on the sample preparation condition .",
    "allodi et al.@xcite and jung et al.@xcite suggested nanoscale size ferromagnetic clusters at 10 k ( t@xmath9 ) whereas our results suggest rather a macroscopic ( few 1000 angstrom ) size ferromagnetic phase .",
    "very recently , boujelben et al.@xcite showed that the magnetic properties of pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 is sensitive to the quenching condition .",
    "the sample air quenched to room temperature from 1673 k was orthorhombic ( _ imma _ ) and underwent ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic transition whereas the water quenched sample was rhombohedral ( _ r3c _ ) ) and did not show antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "both the samples were found to be stoichiometric and the differences in magnetic properties were suggested to disorder effect in a - site.@xcite our sample was furnace cooled ( 5 k / min ) from 1573 k to room temperature and was found to be tetragonal.@xcite recent theoretical model predict that the strength of disorder at a - site cations can control the size of two coexisting phases.@xcite    fig .",
    "3(a ) shows the parallel magnetostriction ( @xmath43 ) isotherms for t @xmath44 t@xmath9 and fig .",
    "3(c ) shows @xmath43 for t@xmath9 t t@xmath4 .  at 25 k ,",
    "@xmath29 is small below @xmath26h@xmath4 = 4 t and then increases rapidly in between 4 t and 6 t. a change of slope occurs around 6.5 t and above this field @xmath29 increases less rapidly without saturation up to the maximum field of 14.2 t. the value of @xmath27 at 14.2 t is 900 x 10@xmath45 . a clear hysteresis is seen while reducing the field . when the field is reduced to 0 t , @xmath43 does not return to the original starting value but  attains a higher value ( @xmath650 x 10@xmath45 ) .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath43 just above 4 t correlates with the metamagnetic transition found in the m(h ) behavior ( see fig .",
    "the metamagnetic like behavior in magnetostriction is present until 100 k and as t increases from 25 k the metamagnetic like transition occurs at lower fields which is in agreement with m(h ) behavior ( fig .",
    "2 ) . at 125 k ,",
    "150 k and 175 k , @xmath46 increases rapidly at very low fields ( @xmath26h@xmath4 0.5 t ) due to ferromagnetic domain wall motion .",
    "however , @xmath43 increases without saturation up to the maximum field .",
    "we do not see any ferromagnetic contribution to the magnetostriction below the neel temperature although such a behavior is shown in m(h ) ( see fig .",
    "this is possibly due to the smaller fraction of the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "3(b ) and fig .",
    "3(d ) shows the perpendicular magnetostriction ( @xmath47 ) isotherms . as for @xmath29 , @xmath28 undergoes a rapid change during the metamagnetic transition but the sign is opposite to @xmath28 .",
    "an important difference is that the magnitude of the maximum magnetostriction value is lower in the perpendicular case ( @xmath28 = 600 x 10@xmath45 , @xmath43 = 900 x 10@xmath45 at 14.2 t and t = 25",
    "k ) and the hysteresis , in particular the irreversibility at the origin is much larger in the perpendicular magnetostriction isotherms .",
    "for example , @xmath28 = -200 x 10@xmath45 and @xmath29 = 50 x 10@xmath45 at 0 t after the field is reduced from the highest value .",
    "the irreversibility vanishes above the neel temperature ( see 125 k data in fig .",
    "2(b ) and fig .",
    "2(d ) ) .    figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) show the anisotropic magnetostriction ( @xmath0 ) isotherms calculated from the parallel and perpendicular magnetostrictions in figs . 3 ( a)-(d ) .",
    "the anisotropic magnetostriction is nearly zero in the antiferromagnetic state but increases rapidly during the metamagnetic transition . at t = 25 k and @xmath26h = 14.2",
    "the anisotropic magnetostriction reaches the maximum value of 1500 x 10@xmath45 .",
    "it is indeed surprising since such a huge value anisotropic magnetostriction is not found in manganites so far . in a number of manganites@xcite , the anisotropic magnetostriction was found to be negligible ( @xmath0 60 x 10@xmath45 ) compared to the volume magnetostriction ( @xmath6 10@xmath48 ) .",
    "what is also surprising is that the anisotropic magnetostriction even in between t@xmath9 and t@xmath4 ( see 125 k , 150 k , and 175 k data ) is at least a factor of 3 - 5 times larger than what is found in the ferromagnetic manganite la@xmath49ca@xmath50mno@xmath13 in the same temperature range.@xcite the field dependence of @xmath0 below 125 k shows a strong irreversibility at the origin which is a reflection of the behavior of the perpendicular and the parallel magnetostriction isotherms in fig .",
    "3 . in pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13 ,",
    "the maximum @xmath0 was less than 250 x 10@xmath45 at 14.2 t.@xcite the volume magnetostriction ( @xmath1 ) shows a complex behavior as a function of field .",
    "the value of @xmath1 at t = 25 k is negligible in the antiferromagnetic state and shows a sudden decrease during the metamagnetic transition . at t",
    "= 25 k , @xmath1 reaches -250 x10@xmath45 at the maximum field which is about six times lower than the @xmath0 value at the corresponding field .",
    "when the field is decreased from the maximum value @xmath1 decreases to reach still a lower value -600 x 10@xmath51 at 1.5 t and then increases again for further decrease in h. at the origin , @xmath1 is much lower ( -500 x 10@xmath52 ) with respect to the starting value .",
    "there is not much a big change in @xmath1 value between 25 k and 100 k but @xmath1 becomes positive above 125 k as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "4(c ) and fig .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that the volume magnetostriction is positive and larger in value ( @xmath1 1000 x 10@xmath45 at 25 k ) below the neel temperature in other half doped manganites nd@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 and la@xmath2ca@xmath2mno@xmath13.@xcite and also inthe pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13.@xcite    fig .",
    "5 shows the value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the maximum field ( @xmath53h = 14.2 t ) as a function of the temperature .",
    "a rapid change in both @xmath30 and @xmath1 occurs as the neel temperature is approached from below .",
    "the anisotropic magnetostriction decreases rapidly and the volume magnetostriction changes the sign as t@xmath9 is approached .",
    "no clear anomaly is observed at the curie temperature in contrast to the behavior of la@xmath54ca@xmath50mno@xmath13.@xcite the lack of volume anomaly at t@xmath4 can be understood as a result of weak electron - phonon interaction in the paramagnetic state compared to la@xmath49ca@xmath50mno@xmath13 .",
    "it is worthy to note that charges are itinerant in the paramagnetic state ( d@xmath55/dt 0 ) of our compound whereas they are localized in la@xmath49ca@xmath50mno@xmath13 ( d@xmath55/dt 0 ) .",
    "what is the origin of the unusual giant anisotropic magnetostriction in pr@xmath24sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 ?",
    "giant anisotropic magnetostriction is generally found in rare earth intermetallic compounds like tbfe@xmath56 and it is caused by the coupling of magnetic moments to the oval or pancake shaped anisotropic charge cloud of  4f orbitals of the rare earth ion.@xcite the anisotropic magnetostriction in our compounds due to spin - orbit coupling of pr - ions can be neglected since anisotropic effect was not observed in related compounds.@xcite we have to consider other possibilities .",
    "the a - type antiferromagnetism in pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 is caused by the e@xmath21-d@xmath10orbital ordering of mn@xmath14 ions which drives the tetragonal ( _ i4/mcm _ ) to orthorhombic ( _ fmmm _ ) structural transition .",
    "the e@xmath21-orbital moment is quenched but orbital ordering creates a quadrupole moment.@xcite since there is an unpaired electron in the d@xmath10 orbital , there exists a magnetic dipole moment in addition to the quadrupole moment . the quadrupole moment ( which is also assigned to pseudo spin @xmath57 = 1/2 for d@xmath58 and @xmath57 = -1/2 for",
    "d@xmath10 orbitals)@xcite of the e@xmath21-orbital can interact with the lattice through the quadrupole - strain interaction . when the spin ordering changes from the a - type antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic , the d@xmath10 orbital ordering is also expected to be destroyed .",
    "hence , a magnetic field induced structural transition from _ fmmm _ to _ i4/mcm _ symmetry takes place .",
    "the field induced transition is of first order with coexistence of the a - type af domains ( _ fmmm _ ) and the ferromagnetic domains ( _ i4/mcm _ ) . at very high field",
    "( h h@xmath4 ) , only the ferromagnetic mono domain(i4/mcm ) is expected .  however , the orientation and perhaps the shape of the crystallographic ( _ i4/mcm _ ) domains just above h@xmath4 depend on the direction of the applied field .",
    "when the measuring direction is parallel to the applied magnetic field , the _ i4/mcm _ domains are favorably oriented in the field direction and hence the parallel magnetostriction is positive and its value is larger . if we consider columns of the _ i4/mcm _ domains aligned in the field direction , the sign of the perpendicular magnetostriction indicates that the columns contract in the lateral direction .",
    "hence , the anisotropic magnetostriction which is the difference between the parallel and perpendicular magnetostrictions is large . when the field is reduced from the high value , some of the _ i4/mcm _",
    "domains do not revert back to the _ fmmm _ structure which causes the irreversibility at the origin .",
    "the rapid decrease of the anisotropic magnetostriction as t@xmath9 is approached from below can be understood as a result of the decrease in the phase fraction of the _ fmmm _ phase .    the large value of the anisotropic magnetostriction ( see 125 k , 150 k and 175 k data ) above the neel temperature but below the curie temperature is intriguing .",
    "a possible scenario is that nano domains of the low temperature orbital ordered antiferromagnetic phase already exist in the high temperature ferromagnetic phase . as the temperature reduces these nanodomains",
    "grow in size and fuse into macrodomains around the neel temperature .",
    "this can cause hysteresis in m(t ) and @xmath25l / l as we have observed .",
    "such a scenario is not an unlikely possibility given the fact that we also observed appreciable positive volume magnetostriction in the ferromagnetic phase of nd@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 and we have suggested the possibility of the charge - orbital ordered domains in the ferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "more recently , orbital ordered nanostructure was indeed found by x - ray diffusive scattering study in the same composition.@xcite then , the contribution from the field induced structural changes of these nanodomains adds to the usual ferromagnetic contribution and hence the anisotropic magnetostriction is large . finally , some remarks to be made about the differences between the magnetostriction behaviors of pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13 and pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 .",
    "it was shown earlier@xcite that pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13 exhibits a giant positive volume magnetostriction in constrast to the small negative volume magnetostriction effect found in pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 .",
    "but , the anisotropic magnetostriction in pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13 is an order of magnitude smaller than in pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 .",
    "we believe that these differences are related to the volume of differences between the orthorhombic(antiferromagnetic ) and tetragonal ( ferromagnetic or paramagnetic ) phases .",
    "the spontaneous volume ( h = 0 t ) shows a dramatic decrease around the neel temperature in pr@xmath34sr@xmath35mno@xmath13 whereas it is rather smooth across the ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic transition in pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 . the behavior of the d@xmath10 orbital ordering due to excess electrons and the magnitude of exchange interactions will play important role in these two compounds , but the details are yet to be understood .",
    "to summarize , the linear thermal expansion of pr@xmath2sr@xmath2mno@xmath13 does not show any clear anomaly either at the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transition .",
    "our isothermal magnetization study suggeststhat a minority ferromagnetic phase coexists with the majority antiferromagnetic phase below the neel temperature .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase fraction is about 13 % at 25 k. the field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition is accompanied by a giant anisotropic magnetostriction ( @xmath0 @xmath6 10@xmath59 ) and a smaller volume contraction ( @xmath1 @xmath610@xmath8 ) .",
    "this is the first time such a large anisotropic magnetostriction is found in manganites .",
    "the value of anisotropic magnetostriction is large below the neel temperature but its value even in the ferromagnetic temperature region is larger than found in other manganites .",
    "the anisotropic magnetostriction does not saturate even at 14.2 t in the ferromagnetic temperature region .",
    "we suggest that the metamagnetic transition in spin sector is accompanied by the creation of tetragonal ( @xmath60 ) ferromagnetic domains from the orthorhombic ( @xmath61 ) antiferromagnetic matrix .",
    "the large anisotropic magnetostriction is suggested to formation of  ferromagnetic domains ( @xmath60 ) in the field direction .",
    "our magnetostriction and temperature dependence of the magnetization also suggest that nanodomains of the low temperature @xmath61 ( antiferromagnetic phase ) are possibly present in 125 k- 200 k where the sample is supposed to be a long range ferromagnet .",
    "contrary to the large anisotropic magnetostriction , the volume magnetostriction is rather small . in view of the large anisotropic magnetostriction found it is worth to investigate anisotropic properties in magnetoresistance and magnetization as was found in the case of la@xmath62sr@xmath63coo@xmath13.@xcite",
