    "in the absence of a more fundamental physical model based on first - principles for the description of the cosmic acceleration discovered more than a decade ago@xcite ( see , for reviews , @xcite ) , many dark energy phenomenological models have been proposed and investigated in detail . in particular , the questions about the stability against small perturbations in the initial conditions and in the model parameters are always the first requirement demanded to assure the physical viability of any cosmological model .",
    "the most part of such dark energy models belong to the general class of cosmological models governed by an action of the type ( see , for instance , @xcite ) [ act ] s = d^4x f(r,,x ) , where @xmath5 stands for the spacetime scalar curvature , @xmath6 is a scalar field , @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is a smooth function .",
    "quintessence models@xcite , for instance , correspond to the choice @xmath8 non - minimally coupled models@xcite , on the other hand , are typically of the type [ nmc ] f(r,,x ) = f()r -g^ab_a_b+v ( ) .",
    "many other models discussed in the literature correspond yet to the case @xmath9 , including @xmath10-essence@xcite and the string - inspired case of a dirac - born - infeld tachyonic action@xcite .",
    "( for more recent works , see @xcite . ) the particular case of pure modified gravity @xmath11 ( see , for a recent review , @xcite ) has been intensively investigated as an alternative to quintessence .",
    "some primordial inflationary models@xcite are also described by actions of the type ( [ act ] ) .",
    "since one of the proposals of any cosmological model is to describe our universe without finely - tuned parameters , a given dark energy or inflationary model would be physically viable only if it is robust against small perturbations in the initial conditions and in the model parameters .",
    "this is the question to be addressed here .",
    "non - minimally coupled models of the type ( [ nmc ] ) are known to be plagued by anisotropic singularities in the phase space region corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , starobinski@xcite was the first to identify the singularity corresponding to the hypersurfaces @xmath2 , for the case of conformally coupled anisotropic solutions .",
    "futamase and co - workers@xcite identified the same kind of singularity in the context of chaotic inflation in @xmath12 theories ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that such kind of singularities are generically related to anisotropic instabilities .",
    "many authors have described different singularities corresponding to @xmath4 in general models like ( [ act ] ) ( see , for instance , @xcite ) or , more commonly , in pure @xmath13 gravity models ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . such singularities appear typically in rather complex and cumbersome inhomogeneous perturbation analyses , obscuring their physical origin and cause . in this work ,",
    "we show that these singularities are essentially due to anisotropic instabilities , in a similar way to those ones described in @xcite for models of the type ( [ nmc ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that such instabilities typically give rise to dynamically unavoidable singularities , rendering the original model physically unviable",
    ".    one can advance that there are some geometrically special regions on the phase space of the model in question by an elementary analysis of the equations derived from the action ( [ act ] ) .",
    "they are the generalized klein - gordon equation [ kg ] d_a(f_,x ^a ) + f _ , = 0 , and the einstein equations @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "we will consider here the simplest anisotropic homogeneous cosmological model , the bianchi type i , whose spatially flat metric is given by [ metric ] ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t)dx^2 + b^2(t)dy^2 + c^2(t)dz^2 .",
    "the dynamically relevant quantities in this case are h_1 = , h_2 = , h_3 =  .",
    "for such a metric and with a homogeneous scalar field @xmath16 , einstein eq .",
    "( [ ee ] ) can be written as @xmath17 and the generalized klein - gordon equation will read [ kgg ] ( f_,x ) + ( h_1+h_2+h_3)f_,x - f _ , = 0 .",
    "notice that ( [ kgg ] ) is a second order differential equation for @xmath6 , while eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) form a higher order system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "since @xmath18 , the term corresponding to @xmath19 involves , in fact , second derivatives of @xmath5 and , consequently , third derivatives of @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the corresponding phase space @xmath22 is 11-dimensional and spanned by the variables @xmath23",
    "( [ ec ] ) corresponds to the energy constraint .",
    "it restricts the solutions of ( [ e1])-([kgg ] ) on a certain ( vanishing energy ) hypersurface @xmath24 of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , effectively , the solutions of ( [ e1])-([kgg ] ) are constrained to the 10-dimensional manifold @xmath25 .",
    "it is quite simple to show that eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) are not compatible , in general , on the hypersurface @xmath26 of @xmath22 corresponding to the region where @xmath27 . subtracting ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) from ( [ e1 ] ) we have , respectively , on such hypersurface [ cau ] ( h_1-h_2 ) = 0 ,  and ( h_1-h_3 ) = 0 .",
    "hence , eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) can not be fulfilled in general for anisotropic metrics .",
    "as it will be shown , the hypersurface @xmath26 indeed corresponds a geometrical singularity for anisotropic spacetimes which can not be dynamically prevented in general by requiring , for instance , that @xmath28 on the hypersurface @xmath26 as suggested naively from ( [ cau ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the cauchy problem for the eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([kgg ] ) is ill - posed on this hypersurface , since one can not choose general initial conditions on it .",
    "in order to study the geometrical nature of the singular hypersurface @xmath26 , let us consider the einstein eqs .",
    "( [ ec])-([e3 ] ) in detail . for the metric ( [ metric ] )",
    ", we have the following identities @xmath29 now , we introduce the new dynamical variables @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . notice that [ r ] r = 2 + ( 2p^2 + q^2 + r^2 - qr ) , implying that @xmath33 involves terms up to third order derivative in @xmath34 and up to second order in @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in terms of the new dynamical variables , einstein eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) can be cast in the form @xmath37 as to the energy constraint ( [ ec ] ) , we have @xmath38 and the generalized klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) reads simply [ kg1 ] ( f_,x + f_,xx ^2 ) + ( f_,xr + f_,x+ pf_,x ) - f _ , = 0 .",
    "notice that the eqs .",
    "( [ ep])-([kg1 ] ) do not involve the terms @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ". moreover , eqs .",
    "( [ eq ] ) and ( [ er ] ) are , respectively , first order differential equations for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , from which the terms involving first and second derivative of @xmath35 and @xmath36 present in the terms @xmath41 and @xmath19 of ( [ ep ] ) and ( [ ec1 ] ) can be evaluated directly .",
    "the order reduction of the system of differential equations attained with the introduction of the new dynamical variables implies that the phase space @xmath22 is not 11 , but 7-dimensional and spanned by the variables @xmath42 .",
    "the solutions are still constrained to the hypersurface @xmath25 corresponding to the energy constraint ( [ ec1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that the manifold @xmath43 is , in fact , 6-dimensional .",
    "there is still a further dynamical restriction on the solutions of ( [ ep])-([kg1 ] ) . from ( [ eq ] ) and ( [ er ] ) , one has [ restr ] r - q=0 , implying that @xmath44 is a constant of motion fixed only by the initial conditions .",
    "suppose the initial ratio is @xmath45 : this would imply that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 , leading to , for instance , @xmath48 in the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "this simplification is a consequence of the scalar character of our homogeneous source field , and it is also present@xcite in the non - minimally coupled case given by actions of the form ( [ nmc ] ) .",
    "let @xmath49 be the hypersurface corresponding to @xmath50 constant .",
    "finally , the solutions of ( [ ep])-([kg1 ] ) are necessary restricted to the 5-dimensional submanifold @xmath51 of @xmath52 .",
    "a closer analysis of eqs . ( [ eq ] ) and ( [ er ] ) reveals the presence of the singularity .",
    "they can be written as @xmath53 in general , the right - hand side of these equations diverge on the hypersurface @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath27 , unless @xmath54 .",
    "the first observation is that ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ er1 ] ) imply , in general , that , if @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) vanishes for some @xmath47 , it will vanish for any @xmath47 .",
    "this is why such kind of singularity can be evaded in homogeneous and isotropic situations .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section , with an explicit example .",
    "for any physically viable cosmological model , small amounts of anisotropy , corresponding to small @xmath35 and @xmath36 , must stay bounded during the cosmological history .",
    "in fact , it is desirable that they diminish , tending towards an isotropic situation . however , this does not happen in general if @xmath27 in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ er1 ] ) .",
    "let us assume that @xmath55 on the hypersurface @xmath26 .",
    "( we will return to this point latter . ) in this case , if any anisotropic solution crosses @xmath26 , necessarily @xmath56 and @xmath57 will diverge , corresponding to a real spacetime geometrical singularity , as one can check by considering the kretschman invariant @xmath58 , which for the metric ( [ metric ] ) is given by @xmath59 as one can see , @xmath60 is the sum of non negative terms .",
    "moreover , any divergence of the variables @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , or of their time derivatives , would suppose a divergence in @xmath60 , characterizing a real geometrical singularity .",
    "since the relation between the variables @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 is linear , any divergence of the first , or of their time derivative , will suppose a divergence in @xmath60 .",
    "there are two basically distinct situations where the singularity corresponding to the hypersurface @xmath26 could be evaded dynamically .",
    "we will show that both are very unlike to occur in physical situations .",
    "the first one corresponds to the case when the hypersurface @xmath26 belongs to some dynamically unaccessible region . in such a case",
    "we , of course , do not face any singularity , since @xmath64 will never vanish along a solution of the system .",
    "this would be equivalent to state that @xmath65 . in our case",
    ", it would imply , from ( [ ec1 ] ) , that the equation [ conc ] p = xf_,x - f has no solution in @xmath22 .",
    "this would correspond to a quite concocted and artificial function @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , for all models we could find in the literature having the hypersurface @xmath26 , the equation ( [ conc ] ) has solutions .",
    "the second situation corresponds to the already mentioned case where @xmath28 on the hypersurface @xmath26 . from ( [ conc ] )",
    ", we see that this requires necessarily that the function @xmath7 be homogeneous of degree @xmath66 in the variable @xmath67 on @xmath26 .",
    "again , a highly artificial situation .",
    "any point on the energy constraint hypersurface @xmath43 is , in principle , a dynamically possible point .",
    "moreover , it is desirable for any cosmological model free of finely - tuned parameters that any point or , at least , a large region of @xmath43 could be chosen as the initial condition for a cosmological evolution .",
    "this , of course , includes also the neighborhood of the hypersurface @xmath68 provided that @xmath69 .",
    "the singularities described in the precedent section imply that any model governed by an action of the type ( [ act ] ) having a hypersurface @xmath26 will certainly present severe anisotropic instabilities that will render it physically unviable .",
    "let us work out an explicit example in order to illustrate the dynamical role of such anisotropic instabilities . the pure modified gravity model [ frc ] f(r ) = r - r_*(1 + ) , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are free positive parameters , was recently proposed@xcite as a viable model to describe the recent cosmic acceleration .",
    "such a model has a hypersurface @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath72 , where f(r)= 1 - . in @xcite",
    ", it is assumed a universe filled with radiation and dark matter , but , for our purposes here , it is enough to consider the pure geometrical lagrangian given by ( [ frc ] ) .",
    "let us start , as in @xcite , assuming a homogeneous and isotropic universe @xmath73 .",
    "einstein eqs .",
    "( [ ec])-([e3 ] ) for this case would correspond simply to the energy constraint [ ec2 ] 6hf(r ) + f(r ) - rf(r ) + 6h^2f(r)= 0 , and to the generalized friedman equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 in this homogeneous and isotropic case . note that [ fp ] f(r ) = >",
    "0 , for @xmath76 . eq .",
    "( [ ee2 ] ) is a third order differential equation for @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the relevant phase space is 3-dimensional and spanned by the variables @xmath78 , but the solutions are in fact constrained to the 2-dimensional manifold @xmath24 corresponding to the energy constraint ( [ ec2 ] ) .",
    "the manifold @xmath24 is an ordinary smooth surface , with a single value of @xmath79 assigned to each pair @xmath80 , provided @xmath81 and @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the solutions of ( [ ee2 ] ) can be conveniently projected on the plane @xmath80 , without any loss of dynamical information .",
    "it is convenient to work with the dimensionless quantities @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the phase space for this model is quite simple .",
    "there are only two fixed points corresponding to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the positive solution of the equation 2(1 + ) = + .",
    "this solution exists and is unique provided that @xmath87 . both equations ( [ ec2 ] ) and ( [ ee2 ] ) are invariant under the transformation @xmath88 and @xmath89 , implying that the @xmath90 negative portion of the phase space can be obtained from the positive one by means of a time reversal operation .",
    "typical trajectories projected on the @xmath91 plane of the phase space are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig ] .",
    "notice that the surfaces corresponding to @xmath92 constant are simple parabolas @xmath93 in the @xmath91 plane . for the model in question",
    ", the @xmath68 surface corresponds to one of these parabolas , namely @xmath94 .",
    "the point here is that the existence of such a surface does not imply any singular behavior for the equation ( [ ee2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , the solutions crossing the surface @xmath95 depicted in [ fig ] are perfectly regular .",
    "hence , homogeneous and isotropic solutions can cross without problem the singular hypersurface .",
    "suppose now the system has a small amount of anisotropy , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in this case",
    ", we have from ( [ r ] ) @xmath98 and the equation ( [ ep ] ) for @xmath34 will be essentially the same ( [ ee2 ] ) obeyed by @xmath77 in the isotropic case , provided the anisotropy is indeed kept small along the solutions . for the amounts of anisotropy @xmath35 and @xmath36 ,",
    "however , the relevant equations will be ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ er1 ] ) . since we know from ( [ restr ] ) that @xmath99",
    ", we can consider here only the variable @xmath35 [ eq3 ] = -(p + ) q. in any region of the phase space far from the surface @xmath95 , the right - handed side of ( [ eq3 ] ) is well behaved .",
    "moreover , from the energy constraint ( [ ec1 ] ) , we have [ ec3 ] p+ = p + + ( r- ) .",
    "a closer analysis reveals that rf(r ) - f(r ) = r_*((1 + ) - ) 0 , with the equality holding only for @xmath100 , implying that for the region @xmath101 , at least , the quantity between parenthesis in ( [ eq3 ] ) is positive , leading indeed to an isotropization of the solutions . for regions close to the surface @xmath95 ,",
    "on the other hand , the situation is qualitatively different . from ( [ ec3 ] )",
    ", we have that the right - handed side of ( [ eq3 ] ) diverges on the surface @xmath95 .",
    "if an anisotropic solution reaches such surface , we have from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) that @xmath56 diverges , implying that this model does not admit any amount of anisotropy at all , precluding any possibility of constructing a realistic model based solely in the geometric lagrangian ( [ frc ] ) .",
    "similar results hold also for the other functions @xmath13 discussed in @xcite , namely f(r ) = r - r_*(1 + ) ^ , with @xmath102 .",
    "the singularities associated with the hypersurface @xmath27 described here are not new . they have been discovered and rediscovered many times for many different models in rather complex and cumbersome inhomogeneous perturbation analysis around a given well behaved background solution .",
    "our results , however , enlighten the physical origin of such singularities .",
    "they arise already in the background level and are related to anisotropic expansion rates .",
    "any solution crossing the hypersurface @xmath27 will not admit , in general , any amount of anisotropy , otherwise it will certainly develop a catastrophic geometrical singularity with , for instance , the blowing up of the kretschman invariant ( [ kret ] ) .",
    "this , in fact , precludes the possibility of constructing a realistic model with solutions crossing the hypersurface @xmath27 since we would have qualitatively distinct behavior for arbitrarily close homogeneous solutions : a perfect isotropic and a slightly anisotropic one .",
