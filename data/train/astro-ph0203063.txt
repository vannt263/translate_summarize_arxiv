    "extreme horizontal - branch ( ehb ) stars occupy the hot end of the horizontal branch ( hb ) in globular clusters with extended blue hb tails .",
    "the envelope masses of these stars are too small ( @xmath2  @xmath30.02  @xmath4 ) to sustain hydrogen - shell burning , and thus nearly all of their luminosity comes from helium burning in the core .",
    "recent observations have discovered an unexpected population of hot stars lying below the canonical ehb in the uv color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of @xmath0  cen ( dcruz et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) . in the present paper",
    "we will use new uv observations of the globular cluster ngc  2808 to explore the origin of these subluminous ehb stars and will suggest that these stars may be the progeny of stars which underwent extensive mixing during a delayed helium flash on the white - dwarf ( wd ) cooling curve ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "our data for ngc  2808 were obtained in the far - uv ( fuv , @xmath5   ) and near - uv ( nuv , @xmath6   ) bandpasses of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "the hb of ngc  2808 is bimodal with a large gap between the blue hb ( bhb ) and red hb ( rhb ) stars .",
    "in addition , ngc  2808 has a very long blue hb tail that is punctuated by two gaps : one between the ehb and bhb and one within the ehb itself ( sosin et al .",
    "1997 ; walker 1999 ; bedin et al .",
    "our stis cmd ( figure 1 ) shows the following features :    * the gap between the ehb and bhb at @xmath7  mag is well detected , as is the gap between the bhb and rhb at @xmath8  mag .",
    "the gap within the ehb seen in optical cmds is not present .",
    "* there is a large population of hot subluminous hb stars , previously known to exist only in @xmath0  cen ( dcruz et al .",
    "2000 ) . out of a total of 75 ehb stars ,",
    "46 are fainter than the canonical zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) . *",
    "5 luminous post - ehb stars are found at @xmath9  mag .",
    "to study the origin of the hot subluminous ehb stars , we computed a set of evolutionary sequences which followed the evolution of a low - mass star continuously from the main sequence through the helium flash to the zahb .",
    "all sequences had the same heavy - element abundance z of 0.0015 , corresponding to [ fe / h ] = @xmath101.31 for [ @xmath11/fe ] = 0.3 , and an initial main - sequence mass @xmath12 of @xmath13 , corresponding to an age of 13 gyr at the tip of the rgb .",
    "the sequences only differed in the extent of mass loss along the rgb which we specified by varying the mass - loss parameter @xmath14 in the reimers formulation from 0 to 1 .",
    "our purpose was to determine if mixing between the helium core and hydrogen envelope might occur during the helium flash , as found previously by sweigart ( 1997 ) .",
    "a representative sample of our evolutionary tracks is shown in figure 2 .",
    "for @xmath15 the helium flash occurs at the tip of the rgb . as the mass loss increases , however , the models peel off the rgb and evolve to high effective temperatures before igniting helium ( so - called `` hot he - flashers '' ; castellani & castellani 1993 ; dcruz et al . 1996 ) .",
    "for @xmath16 the helium flash occurs between the tip of the rgb and the top of the wd cooling curve .    in all sequences with @xmath17 the flash convection zone produced by the high helium - burning luminosity ( peak @xmath18 ) failed to reach the hydrogen envelope by @xmath31 pressure - scale height . thus mixing between the helium core and the hydrogen envelope",
    "does not occur if a star ignites helium either on the rgb or during the evolution to the top of the wd cooling curve . in these cases",
    "we confirm the canonical assumption that the helium flash does not affect either the envelope mass or composition .",
    "the canonical evolution described above changes dramatically when the helium flash occurs further down the wd cooling curve ( figure 2 ) . as a star descends the cooling curve , the entropy barrier of its hydrogen shell decreases ( iben 1976 ) . as a result",
    ", the flash convection is then able to penetrate deeply into the hydrogen envelope ( sweigart 1997 ; brown et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the protons captured by the flash convection will be mixed into the helium - burning core while helium and carbon from the core will be mixed outward into the envelope .",
    "the calculations of sweigart ( 1997 ) indicate that this `` flash mixing '' will consume most , if not all , of the envelope hydrogen while simultaneously enriching the envelope in helium and carbon .",
    "all of our sequences with @xmath19 encountered flash mixing .",
    "these sequences were stopped at the onset of mixing due to the numerical difficulty of following the proton mixing and nucleosynthesis .",
    "sequences with @xmath20 did not ignite helium and thus died as helium white dwarfs .",
    "flash mixing is a consequence of the basic properties of the stellar models and hence should occur whenever a star ignites helium on the wd cooling curve .",
    "analogous mixing occurs during a very late helium - shell flash according to the `` born - again '' scenario for producing hydrogen - deficient stars ( iben 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "ehb evolutionary tracks for both canonical ( @xmath17 ) and flash - mixed ( @xmath19 ) sequences are plotted in figure 3 . the canonical ( i.e. , unmixed ) models have the same h - rich envelope composition as the pre - helium flash models .",
    "the zahb models for the flash - mixed tracks were obtained by changing the envelope composition to mimic the effects of flash mixing .",
    "we considered both he + c - rich and he - rich envelope compositions for these flash - mixed models ( see caption of figure 3 ) . for comparison",
    "the bottom panel of figure 3 shows a set of tracks with @xmath19 which have the same h - rich envelope composition as the canonical models .",
    "several features of figure 3 deserve comment . first , there is a well - defined high temperature limit to the canonical ehb at an effective temperature @xmath21 of @xmath331,500  k for the present metallicity . within the canonical framework",
    "it is not possible to produce hotter ehb stars regardless of the extent of mass loss along the rgb .",
    "second , the flash - mixed tracks are separated by a gap of @xmath36000  k in @xmath21 from the hot end of the canonical ehb . as a consequence , flash mixing leads to a sharp dichotomy in the properties of the ehb stars .",
    "the change from canonical to flash - mixed evolution occurs over an interval of only 0.001 in @xmath14 , corresponding to a mass - loss difference of only 10@xmath22 .",
    "in order to compare our ehb models with the stis data , we computed new stellar atmospheres for both h - rich and h - depleted compositions . the spectral energy distribution for a canonical ehb star is compared to the spectra for 2 flash - mixed stars with he + c - rich and he - rich atmospheres in figure 4 .",
    "the enhanced helium abundance in the flash - mixed stars reduces the hydrogen opacity below 912    so that more of the flux is radiated in the extreme uv at the expense of the flux at longer wavelengths .",
    "enhancing the carbon abundance along with helium restores some of this extreme uv opacity , but the resulting spectrum is still redder and fainter in the far - uv than a normal spectrum .    using these he + c - rich and he - rich stellar atmospheres , we translated the zahb models from the flash - mixed sequences to the stis cmd ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the flash - mixed models show the same dramatic drop in the far - uv luminosity as the stis data .",
    "this drop can be attributed to 1 ) the lower far - uv flux in the spectral energy distribution of the flash - mixed models ( see figure 4 ) and 2 ) the larger bolometric correction due to their higher temperatures ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "evolution off the zahb will fill in the region between these flash - mixed models in figure 5 and the canonical zahb .",
    "radiative levitation of fe would shift the flash - mixed models redward , possibly explaining the color spread of the subluminous stars .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath14 = 0.860 zahb model with a normal h - rich envelope in figure 5 lies just @xmath30.1  mag fainter than the hot end of the canonical ehb , a consequence of its slightly smaller core mass ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is clear therefore that hot he flashers which ignore flash mixing can not explain the subluminous stars in either @xmath0  cen or ngc  2808 .",
    "optical cmds also show a gap within the ehb of ngc  2808 .",
    "we have plotted our zahb models in the ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) cmd to see if the temperature difference between the flash - mixed and canonical tracks in figure 3 might produce such a gap . as expected ,",
    "the flash - mixed models are separated by a gap of @xmath30.5  mag in v from the hot end of the canonical ehb .",
    "our simulations , which include evolution off the zahb , predict an ehb gap close to that observed in ngc  2808 ( see brown et al .",
    "a similar ehb gap is not seen in @xmath0  cen , possibly because it has been obscured by the metallicity spread of the cluster .",
    "* stars which ignite helium on the white - dwarf cooling curve will undergo substantial mixing between the helium core and hydrogen envelope during the helium flash .",
    "this flash - induced mixing will greatly enhance the envelope helium and carbon abundances .",
    "* flash - mixed ehb stars will appear subluminous in uv color - magnitude diagrams due to their redistributed far - uv flux and larger bolometric corrections , in agreement with the subluminous stars in @xmath0  cen and ngc  2808 .",
    "* flash mixing leads to a dichotomy in the properties of ehb stars .",
    "the temperature gap between the flash - mixed and canonical ( i.e. , unmixed ) stars may explain the ehb gap found in optical cmds of ngc  2808 .",
    "* flash mixing on the white - dwarf cooling curve may provide a new evolutionary channel for producing h - deficient stars , particularly the high gravity , he - rich sdo stars ( lemke et al . 1997 ) and the minority of sdb stars that are he - rich ( moehler , heber , & durrell 1997 ) .",
