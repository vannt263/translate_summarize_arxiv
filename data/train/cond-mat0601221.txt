    "solitary waves or solitons represent one of the striking and famous aspects of nonlinear phenomena in spatially extended systems .",
    "they appear as specific types of localized solutions of various nonlinear partial differential equations and possess several important properties @xcite .",
    "these properties include an exponential localization of energy remaining unchanged during soliton propagation , and an elastic scattering of solitons . the latter one , i.e. the fact that two solitary waves maintain their identity after collisions , inspired the introduction of the term _ soliton _ @xcite , which emphasizes the analogy between these objects and particles .",
    "later it has been realized , however , that an essential condition for the particle - like behavior of solitons is the integrability of the corresponding models .",
    "but the effect of dynamical localization of energy was found to be much more general , and the notion of soliton has been extended nowadays to non - integrable models as well .",
    "an analogy between such `` generalized '' solitons and particles is less obvious .",
    "not only the scattering process is generally different from the elastic scattering of particles , but several other important physical effects may appear for solitary waves in non - integrable models .",
    "an important feature essentially breaking the particle approach to soliton dynamics is connected with the possibility of excitation of the so - called _ shape _ @xcite or _ internal _",
    "@xcite modes : in contrast to a rigid body , a soliton may perform shape oscillations while propagating .",
    "the mechanism of possible energy exchange between the soliton kinetic energy , associated with its translational motion , and the internal energy of shape modes , can drastically change the soliton dynamics and leads in some cases to resonances during soliton - soliton interactions @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of soliton dynamics in non - integrable systems , which we address in this paper , concerns the problem of energy transport associated with a directed soliton propagation .",
    "since a soliton carries some ( finite ) non - zero energy , it is naturally to assume that its translational motion would result in a non - zero energy current in the system .",
    "one can introduce a _ total field momentum _ , in analogy to a particle mechanical momentum , which precisely corresponds to the energy current when considering solitons in integrable systems @xcite .",
    "however , an attempt to extend this momentum - based approach to dissipative solitons may lead to confusing and misleading results . as an example",
    ", we mention here the so - called soliton ratchets : the effect of a unidirectional motion of a topological soliton ( kink ) under the influence of a spatially homogeneous and time - periodic external bias with zero mean @xcite .",
    "as an extension of single particle ratchets @xcite , at a first glance soliton ratchets demonstrate at least qualitatively a nice analogy between solitons and particles .",
    "indeed , applying the same symmetry analysis as for particle ratchets @xcite , one observes a directed motion of kinks not only in numerical simulations , but also in experiments with annular josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "however , a surprising and puzzling result appears if one estimates the energy current for the soliton ratchet case : simple analytical calculations tell that the averaged value of the total field momentum is strictly equal to zero @xcite .",
    "an analogous effect of non - topological soliton motion with zero total field momentum has been reported also for a nonlinear schrdinger equation with parametric driving in the presence of dissipation @xcite .",
    "these results show , that the total field momentum is no longer an adequate quantity to describe the energy flow due to soliton dynamics in non - integrable damped and driven systems .",
    "in this paper we study the energy flow due to soliton dynamics in the framework of the sin - gordon model with a spatially homogeneous external driving and damping .",
    "we show , that in general the energy current associated with a translational motion of the topological soliton ( kink ) consists of two contributions .",
    "the abovementioned total field momentum constitutes only one component of the total current - the _ internal _ current .",
    "another path for energy transport in the system is mediated by an inhomogeneous in time and space energy exchange between the soliton and the external degrees of freedom ( driving force and damping ) . the corresponding _ exchange _ current has no analogy within the particle description of a moving soliton .",
    "its existence is solely due to the spatial extent of the soliton . even for the case of a time - independent driving , when shape modes are not excited",
    ", the exchange current is small but nonzero .",
    "it is drastically enhanced by the excitation of shape modes via a time - periodic driving or a spatial discretization of the system .",

    "we demonstrate , that the internal energy current does not account for the total energy flow in the system .",

    "as will be shown below , an inhomogeneous exchange of energy between the kink and the external degrees of freedom ( force and dissipation ) , opens an additional path for energy transport in the system , which , together with the above internal current , constitute the full energy current balance generated by the moving kink .",

    "for a point particle the current balance would not change , since the energy loss due to the damping would be compensated by the external dc field . for the spatially extended kink",

    "their existence can essentially modify energy exchange mechanisms between the moving kink and external driving forces and damping . as a consequence , the relative contributions of the internal and exchange currents to the total energy current can be strongly changed in the discrete case both for dc and ac driving forces .",

    "the internal current scales down to zero as @xmath168 for @xmath169 , which follows from the approximation of integrals by discrete sums @xcite .",

    "since for these values of @xmath167 the peierls - nabarro potential is still exponentially small @xcite , the cause of the corrections is simply the change of the kink shape which is of order @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "we discussed the issue of soliton - assisted energy transport in spatially extended systems with external driving and damping . considering the topological soliton ( kink ) motion in the well - known sin - gordon model",

    "in particular , in the case of a directed soliton motion under the influence of time - periodic external forces with zero mean , the averaged value of the total field momentum is known to be strictly zero @xcite , while the energy transport associated with the soliton motion is obviously non - zero .",
    "we identified a new energy pathway  _ the exchange current _  which is entirely mediated by the spatial and temporal inhomogeneity of the system state . even for the case of a dc external force",
    ", the exchange current is found to be small but nonzero . combining both dc and ac driving we obtain situations",
    "when the total field momentum is nonzero but the kink does not move on average or moves even in the direction opposite to the field momentum .",
    "the approach to the energy transport in spatially extended systems which is based solely on the consideration of the total field momentum reduces the kink motion to that of a point particle .",
    "however , the soliton motion in presence of ac driving forces is always accompanied by the excitation of internal modes @xcite , which makes the dynamical properties of the moving soliton essentially different from those of a point particle . although we stress here that even in cases where no shape modes are excited the total field momentum is not sufficient to obtain the total energy current , see sec .",

    "@xcite .    finally , we would like to note , that our results are also instructive for the general case of spatially extended systems coupled to external driving forces or other degrees of freedom , see e.g. refs .  @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the damped and driven sin - gordon system in eq.([sge ] ) , as well as its discretized version in eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) , are relevant physical models of annular @xcite and coupled @xcite josephson junction oscillators , respectively",
    ". therefore , an intriguing question rises about the possibility of detection of the new exchange current mechanism on the basis of available experimental data ( current - voltage characteristics , spectra of emitted radiation , etc ) .",
