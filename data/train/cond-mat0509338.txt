    "we chose the odd total length in order to avoid relatively large oscillations between even and odd @xmath3-values which are present in even - length chains .",
    "these are connected with the different dimerization patterns in the spin correlation functions which are induced by the open ends .",
    "although this is an interesting topic , we preferred to avoid it for the present purpose .",
    "+ to determine the effect of the impurity bond on the entanglement entropy @xmath8 between left side and right side , we performed extensive dmrg calculations .",
    "as usual in such calculations , we first determined the ground state wavefunction of ( [ chain ] ) and then traced out the spin degrees of freedom of the right side to obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the defect was inserted only at the last step of the procedure .",
    "we worked with @xmath25 states and used no sweeps .",

    "such calculations were done recently for segments in homogeneous chains with interface defects @xcite and in random chains @xcite . for the present geometry with open ends , this correlation function can be determined analytically for the pure system ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "then one finds c_ij= [ corr ] with a defect , @xmath31 has to be calculated numerically using the single - particle eigenfunctions of @xmath32 and the filling .",

    "the error in the effective central charge shown in the lower panel is larger and shows more noise .",

    "these results show a clear distinction between attractive and repulsive interactions and a crossover between the two which is determined by the strength of the perturbation .",
    "this strength fixes the value of @xmath0 in the non - interacting system .",
    "because this value depends only weakly on the size , it serves as a reference point through which the @xmath59 curves for different sizes go .",
    "the curves , which we determined only at a number of points , will be continuous in all finite systems .",
    "these findings are in line with the general predictions on the influence of an impurity in a luttinger liquid , namely that for attraction the perturbation heals with increasing system size , while for repulsion it becomes stronger . for the weakened bonds which we have considered",
    ", the latter case means a scaling towards zero and a cutting of the chain .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath0 is in agreement with this picture , but the cutting should not be taken too literally since it only refers to processes near the fermi energy . as fig.[entro ] shows , there remains a residual entanglement corresponding to the constant @xmath60 in ( [ log ] ) which depends on the interaction strength .",
    "+ there is no general expression for @xmath8 in a finite system , not even for the xx case , but in @xcite a formula was given for a weak impurity in a luttiger liquid .",
    "the contribution to @xmath8 is then s= -y^2 ^ 2 ( ) ^1-g ( ) - b(g ) [ levine ] where @xmath61 is the strength of the impurity potential , @xmath62 a small - distance cutoff , @xmath63 a positive constant and @xmath64 the luttinger liquid parameter measuring the interaction . for the xxz lattice model",
    ", it can be expressed as = 2 ( 1- arccos ) [ luttinger ] for attraction ( @xmath11 ) one has @xmath65 and for repulsion @xmath66 . in the latter case , @xmath67 is always negative and diverges with @xmath3 .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath67 on the left of fig.[delta - s ] actually show this behaviour .",
    "one can also fit the data to equ.([levine ] ) as is shown on the right for @xmath68 .",
    "the value of @xmath64 is then 0.75 and the fit gives @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "however , similar fits for @xmath71 and @xmath72 lead to very different results for @xmath62 and if one interprets it as an effective length determined by the scaling equations there are still inconsistencies . for attraction the @xmath3-dependent term in ( [ levine ] ) is positive and decreases with @xmath3 but the data for @xmath67 are more or less @xmath3-independent and can not be fitted with reasonable parameters .",
    "thus we can not verify levine s formula in detail .",
    "one should mention that he also predicts a @xmath73 term in @xmath67 for the non - interacting system which one does not see in the numerics",
