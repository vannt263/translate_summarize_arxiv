    "is called _",
    "tight_.    tight configurations make interesting choices for canonical representatives of each knot type , and are also referred to as `` ideal knots '' .",
    "it seems that geometric properties of tight knots and links are correlated well with various physical properties of knotted polymers .",
    "these ideas have attracted special attention in biophysics , where they are applied to knotted loops of dna .",
    "such knotted loops are important tools for studying the behavior of various enzymes known as topoisomerases . for information on these applications , see for instance @xcite and the many contributions to the book _ ideal knots _  @xcite .    in the first section of this paper ,",
    "we show the equivalence of various definitions that have previously been given for thickness .",
    "we use this to demonstrate that in any knot or link type there is a ropelength minimizer , and that minimizers are necessarily @xmath0 curves ( theorem  [ thm : min ] ) .",
    "the main results of the paper are several new lower bounds for ropelength , proved by considering intersections of the normal tube and a spanning surface . for a link of unit thickness ,",
    "if one component is linked to  @xmath1 others , then its length is at least @xmath2 , where  @xmath3 is the length of the shortest curve surrounding @xmath1 disjoint unit - radius disks in the plane ( theorem  [ thm : peribound ] ) .",
    "this bound is sharp in many simple cases , allowing us to construct infinite families of tight links , such as the simple chain shown in figure  [ fig : tight - chain ] .",
    "the only previously known example of a tight link was the hopf link built from two round circles , which was the solution to the gehring link problem  @xcite .",
    "our new examples show that ropelength minimizers need not be @xmath4 , and need not be unique .",
    "next , if one component in a unit - thickness link has total linking number  @xmath1 with the other components , then its length is at least @xmath5 , by theorem  [ thm : link ] .",
    "we believe that this bound is never sharp for @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain it by using a calibration argument to estimate the area of a cone surface spanning the given component , and the isoperimetric inequality to convert this to a length bound . for links with linking number zero ,",

    "asymptotic crossing number _ of freedman and he  @xcite .",
    "unit - thickness knots have similar lower bounds on length , but the estimates are more intricate and rely on two additional ideas . in theorem",

    "combining these ideas , we show ( theorem  [ thm : newbounds ] ) that any nontrivial knot has ropelength at least @xmath8 .",
    "the best previously known lower bound  @xcite was @xmath9 .",
    "computer experiments  @xcite using pieranski s sono algorithm  @xcite suggest that the tight trefoil has ropelength around @xmath10 .",
    "our improved estimate still leaves open the old question of whether any knot has ropelength under @xmath11 , that is : can a knot be tied in one foot of one - inch ( diameter ) rope ?",
    "to define the thickness of a curve , we follow the paper  @xcite of gonzalez and maddocks .",
    "although they considered only smooth curves , their definition ( unlike most earlier ones , but see @xcite ) extends naturally to the more general curves we will need . in fact , it is based on menger s notion ( see  ) of the three - point curvature of an arbitrary metric space .",
    "for any three distinct points @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 in @xmath15 , we let @xmath16 be the radius of the ( unique ) circle through these points ( setting @xmath17 if the points are collinear ) . also , if @xmath18 is a line through  @xmath12 , we let @xmath19 be the radius of the circle through @xmath13 tangent to @xmath18 at @xmath12",
    ".    now let @xmath20 be a link in @xmath15 , that is , a disjoint union of simple closed curves . for any @xmath21 , we define the _ thickness _ @xmath22 of @xmath20 in terms of a _ local thickness _",
    "@xmath23 at @xmath21 : @xmath24 to apply this definition to nonembedded curves , note that we consider only triples of distinct points @xmath25 .",
    "we will see later that a nonembedded curve must have zero thickness unless its image is an embedded curve , possibly covered multiple times .",
    "note that any sphere cut three times by @xmath20 must have radius greater than @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the closest distance between any two components of  @xmath20 is at least  @xmath26 , as follows : consider a sphere whose diameter achieves this minimum distance ; a slightly larger sphere is cut four times .",
    "we usually prefer not to deal explicitly with our space curves as maps from the circle .",
    "but it is important to note that below , when we talk about curves being in class @xmath27 , or converging in @xmath28 to some limit , we mean with respect to the constant - speed parametrization on the unit circle .",
    "our first two lemmas give equivalent definitions of thickness .",
    "the first shows that the infimum in the definition of  @xmath22 is always attained in a limit when ( at least ) two of the three points approach each other .",
    "thus , our definition agrees with one given earlier by litherland _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite for smooth curves .",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 is perpendicular to both @xmath31 and @xmath32 , then we call @xmath33 a _ doubly critical self - distance _ for @xmath20 .",
    "[ lem : gm - meets - lsdr ] suppose @xmath20 is @xmath34 , and let @xmath35 be its tangent line at @xmath21 .",
    "then the thickness is given by @xmath36 this equals the infimal radius of curvature of  @xmath20 or half the infimal doubly critical self - distance , whichever is less .",
    "the infimum in the definition of thickness either is achieved for some distinct points @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or is approached along the diagonal when @xmath14 , say , approaches @xmath12 , giving us @xmath37 .",
    "but the first case can not happen unless the second does as well : consider the sphere of radius @xmath38 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 on its equator , and relabel the points if necessary so that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not antipodal . since this @xmath39 is infimal , @xmath20 must be tangent to the sphere at @xmath12 .",
    "thus @xmath40 , and we see that @xmath41 .",
    "this infimum , in turn , is achieved either for some @xmath42 , or in a limit as @xmath43 ( when it is the infimal radius of curvature ) . in the first case , we can check that @xmath12 and @xmath13 must be antipodal points on a sphere of radius @xmath44 , with @xmath20 tangent to the sphere at both points .",
    "that means , by definition , that @xmath26 is a doubly critical self - distance for @xmath20 .    a version of lemma  [ lem : gm - meets - lsdr ] for smooth curves appeared in  @xcite .",
    "similar arguments there show that the local thickness can be computed as @xmath45    [ lem : tau = reach = nir ] for any @xmath34 link @xmath20 , the thickness of  @xmath20 equals the reach of  @xmath20 ; this is also the normal injectivity radius of  @xmath20 .",

    "we will show that @xmath49 .",

    "thus @xmath20 is tangent at @xmath12 and @xmath13 to the sphere around  @xmath47 , so a nearby sphere cuts  @xmath20 four times , giving @xmath50 .",

    "we know that @xmath48 is less than the infimal radius of curvature of @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the midpoint of a chord of  @xmath20 realizing the infimal doubly self - critical distance of  @xmath20 is on two normal disks of  @xmath20 .",
    "using lemma  [ lem : gm - meets - lsdr ] , this shows that @xmath52 , completing the proof .",

    "we define the _ ropelength _ of a link @xmath20 to be @xmath54 , the ( scale - invariant ) quotient of length over thickness .",
    "every curve of finite roplength is @xmath0 , by lemma  [ lem : sec - is - lip ] below .",
    "thus , we are free to restrict our attention to  @xmath0 curves , rescaled to have ( at least ) unit thickness .",
    "this means they have embedded unit - radius normal tubes , and curvature bounded above by  @xmath55 .",
    "the ropelength of such a curve is ( at most ) its length .",
    "we want to prove that , within every knot or link type , there exist curves of minimum ropelength .",
    "the lemma below allows us to use the direct method to get minimizers .",
    "if we wanted to , we could work with @xmath34 convergence in the space of @xmath0 curves , but it seems better to state the lemma in this stronger form , applying to all rectifiable links .",
    "[ lem : thi - is - usc ] thickness is upper semicontinuous with respect to the @xmath56 topology on the space of @xmath57 curves .",

    ", if curves @xmath59 approach @xmath20 , and @xmath16 nearly realizes the thickness of  @xmath20 , then nearby triples of distinct points bound from above the thicknesses of the @xmath59 .",
    "this proof ( compare  @xcite ) is essentially the same as the standard one for the lower semicontinuity of length , when length of an arbitrary curve is defined as the supremal length of inscribed polygons .",
    "note that thickness can jump upwards in a limit , even when the convergence is @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , we might have an elbow consisting of two straight segments connected by a unit - radius circular arc whose angle decreases to zero , as shown in figure  [ fig : thi - is - semicontinuous ] .",
    "when minimizing ropelength within a link type , we care only about links of positive thickness @xmath53 .",

    "since the sector has area @xmath266 , this proves that the cone @xmath206 has area at least  @xmath267 , and thus perimeter at least @xmath268 .",
    "the theorem then follows from lemma  [ lem : pushoff ] as usual .    combining this theorem with proposition  [ prop : fh ] yields :    [ cor : chibounds ] for any nontrivial knot  @xmath100 of unit thickness , @xmath269 for any component  @xmath100 of a link  @xmath20 of unit thickness , @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the minimal thurston norm as above .    as we observed earlier",
    ", @xmath272 is at least the sum of the linking numbers of the  @xmath273 with  @xmath101 , so theorem  [ thm : acbounds ] subsumes theorem  [ thm : link ] .",
    "often , it gives more information .",
    "when the linking numbers of all @xmath101 and @xmath273 vanish , the minimal thurston norm @xmath274 has a particularly simple interpretation : it is the least genus of any embedded surface spanning @xmath101 and avoiding  @xmath20 . for the whitehead link and borromean rings ,",
    "this invariant equals one , and so these bounds do not provide an improvement over the simple - minded bound of theorem  [ thm : peribound ] .    to find an example where corollary  [ cor : chibounds ] is an improvement",
    ", we need to be able to compute the thurston norm .",
    "mcmullen has shown  @xcite that the thurston norm is bounded below by the alexander norm , which is easily computed from the multivariable alexander polynomial .",
    "one example he suggests is a @xmath275torus link with two components .",
    "if we replace one component @xmath100 by its whitehead double , then in the new link , the other component has alexander norm @xmath276 .",
    "since it is clearly spanned by a disk with @xmath277 punctures ( or a genus  @xmath1 surface ) avoiding  @xmath100 , the thurston norm is also @xmath276 .",
    "figure  [ fig : thurston ] ( left ) shows the case @xmath278 , where the alexander polynomial is @xmath279 .    on the other hand , if @xmath100 is either component of the three - fold link @xmath20 on the right in figure  [ fig : thurston ]",
    ", we can span @xmath100 with a genus - two surface , so we expect that @xmath280 , which would also improve our ropelength estimate .",
    "however , it seems hard to compute the thurston norm in this case .",
    "the alexander norm in this case is zero , and even the more refined bounds of harvey  @xcite do not show the thurston norm is any greater .",
    "all of our lower bounds for ropelength have been asymptotically proportional to the square root of the number of components , linking number , parallel crossing number , or asymptotic crossing number .",
    "while our methods here provide the best known results for fairly small links , other lower bounds grow like the @xmath281 power of these complexity measures .",
    "these are of course better for larger links , as described in our paper _ tight knot values deviate from linear relation _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a link type  @xmath282 with crossing number  @xmath1 , the ropelength is at least @xmath283 , where the constant comes from  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "we gave examples ( namely the @xmath284torus knots and the @xmath169-component hopf links , which consist of @xmath169 circles from a common hopf fibration of  @xmath285 ) in which ropelength grows exactly as the @xmath281 power of crossing number .",
    "our theorem  [ thm : peribound ] proves that for the the simple chains ( figure  [ fig : tight - chain ] ) , ropelength must grow linearly in crossing number  @xmath1 .",
    "we do not know of any examples exhibiting superlinear growth , but we suspect they might exist , as described below .    to investigate this problem , consider representing a link type  @xmath282 with unit edges in the standard cubic lattice  @xmath286 .",
    "the minimum number of edges required is called the lattice number  @xmath169 of  @xmath282 .",
    "we claim this is within a constant factor of the ropelength  @xmath107 of a tight configuration of  @xmath282 . indeed , given a lattice representation with @xmath169 edges , we can easily round off the corners with quarter - circles of radius  @xmath287 to create a @xmath0 curve with length less than @xmath169 and thickness  @xmath287 , which thus has ropelength  @xmath107 at most  @xmath288 .",
    "conversely , it is clear that any thick knot of ropelength  @xmath107 has an isotopic inscribed polygon with @xmath289 edges and bounded angles ; this can then be replaced by an isotopic lattice knot on a sufficiently small scaled copy of  @xmath286 .",
    "we omit our detailed argument along the lines , showing @xmath290 , since diao _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently obtained the better bound @xmath291 .",
    "the lattice embedding problem for links is similar to the vlsi layout problem  @xcite , where a graph whose vertex degrees are at most  @xmath292 must be embedded in two layers of a cubic lattice .",
    "it is known  @xcite that any @xmath1-vertex planar graph can be embedded in vlsi layout area @xmath293 .",
    "examples of planar @xmath1-vertex graphs requiring layout area at least @xmath294 are given by the so - called trees of meshes .",
    "we can construct @xmath1-crossing links analogous to these trees of meshes , and we expect that they have lattice number at least  @xmath294 , but it seems hard to prove this . perhaps the vlsi methods can also be used to show that lattice number ( or equivalently , ropelength ) is at most @xmath293 .    here",
    "we will give a simple proof that the ropelength of an @xmath1-crossing link is at most  @xmath295 , by constructing a lattice embedding of length less than  @xmath296 .",
    "this follows from the theorem of schnyder  @xcite which says that an @xmath1-vertex planar graph can be embedded with straight edges connecting vertices which lie on an @xmath297 square grid .",
    "we double this size , to allow each knot crossing to be built on a @xmath298 array of vertices . for an @xmath1-crossing link diagram ,",
    "there are @xmath277 edges , and we use @xmath277 separate levels for these edges . thus we embed the link in a @xmath299 piece of the cubic lattice .",
    "each edge has length less than @xmath300 , giving total lattice number less than @xmath296 .",
    "note that johnston has recently given an independent proof  @xcite that an @xmath1-crossing knot can be embedded in the cubic grid with length @xmath301 .",
    "although her constant is worse than our @xmath302 , her embedding is ( like a vlsi layout ) contained in just two layers of the cubic lattice .",
    "it is tempting to think that an  @xmath301 bound on ropelength could be deduced from the dowker code for a knot , and in fact such a claim appeared in  @xcite .",
    "but we do not see any way to make such an argument work .",
    "the following theorem summarizes the results of this section :    let @xmath282 be a link type with minimum crossing number  @xmath1 , lattice number  @xmath169 , and minimum ropelength @xmath107 .",
    "having concluded our results , we now turn to some open problems and conjectures .",
    "the many examples of tight links constructed in section  [ sec : peribound ] show that the existence and regularity results of section  [ sec : exist ] are in some sense optimal : we know that ropelength minimizers always exist , we can not expect a ropelength minimizer to have global regularity better than @xmath0 , and we have seen that there exist continuous families of ropelength minimizers with different shapes . although we know that each ropelength minimizer has well - defined curvature almost everywhere ( since it is @xmath0 ) it would be interesting to determine the structure of the singular set where the curve is not @xmath4 . we expect this singular set is finite , and in fact :      the @xmath3 bound for the ropelength of links in theorem  [ thm : peribound ] is sharp , and so can not be improved .",
    "but there is a certain amount of slack in our other ropelength estimates . the parallel crossing number and asymptotic crossing number bounds of section  [ sec : newbounds ] and section  [ sec : acbounds ]",
    "could be immediately improved by showing :      for a nontrivial knot , this would increase our best estimate to @xmath305 , a little better than our current estimate of @xmath306 ( but not good enough to decide whether a knot can be tied in one foot of one - inch rope ) .",
    "a more serious improvement would come from proving :      note that the proof of theorem  [ thm : newbounds ] shows only that this intersection has the _ area _ of @xmath211 disks .",
    "this conjecture would improve the ropelength estimate for a nontrivial knot to about @xmath307 , accounting for @xmath308 of pieranski s numerically computed value of @xmath10 for the ropelength of the trefoil  @xcite .",
    "we can see the tightness of this proposed estimate in figure  [ fig : ideal-4pi - inter ] .",
    "pieranski s numerically computed tight trefoil @xmath100 has three - fold symmetry , and there is a @xmath7 cone point  @xmath47 on the symmetry axis .",
    "the cone from @xmath47 also has three - fold symmetry , and a fundamental sector develops into a @xmath309 wedge in the plane , around the point  @xmath47 . here",
    "we show the development of that sector .",
    "the shaded regions are the intersection of the cone with the thick tube around  @xmath100 .",
    "these include a strip ( of width at least  @xmath55 ) inwards from the boundary @xmath100 of the cone , together with a disk around the unique point @xmath84 where @xmath100 cuts this sector of the cone .",
    "our conjecture  [ conj : disj ] estimates the area of the cone from below by the area of a unit disk around @xmath84 plus a unit - width strip around @xmath100 .",
    "the figure shows that the actual shaded disk and strip are not much bigger than this , and that they almost fill the sector .",
    "very recently , diao has announced  @xcite a proof that the length of any unit - thickness knot @xmath100 satisfies @xmath310 this improves our bounds in many cases .",
    "he also finds that the ropelength of a trefoil knot is greater than @xmath11 .",
    "our best current bound for the ropelength of the borromean rings is @xmath311 , from theorem  [ thm : peribound ] .",
    "proving only the conjecture that @xmath312 would give us a fairly sharp bound on the total ropelength : if each component has asymptotic crossing number  @xmath119 , theorem  [ thm : acbounds ] tells us that @xmath313 is a bound for ropelength .",
    "this bound would account for at least @xmath314 of the optimal ropelength , since we can exhibit a configuration with ropelength about @xmath315 , built from three congruent planar curves , as in figure  [ fig : brings - two ] .",
    "although it is hard to see how to improve the ropelength of this configuration of the borromean rings , it is not tight . in work in progress with joe fu , we define a notion of criticality for ropelength , and show that this configuration is not even ropelength - critical .",
    "finally , we observe that our cone surface methods seem useful in many areas outside the estimation of ropelength .",
    "for example , lemma  [ lem : twopi ] provides the key to a new proof an unfolding theorem for space curvess :    [ prop : unfolding ] for any space curve @xmath316 , parametrized by arclength , there is a plane curve @xmath172 of the same length , also parametrized by arclength , so that for every @xmath68 , @xmath317 in @xmath318 , @xmath319    by lemma  [ lem : twopi ] , there exists some cone point @xmath47 for which the cone of @xmath100 to @xmath47 has cone angle @xmath104 . unrolling the cone on the plane , an isometry ,",
    "constructs a plane curve @xmath172 of the same arclength .",
    "further , each chord length of @xmath172 is a distance measured in the instrinsic geometry of the cone , which is at least the corresponding distance in @xmath15 .",
    "this result was proved by reshetnyak  @xcite in a more general setting : a curve in a metric space of curvature bounded above ( in the sense of alexandrov ) has an unfolding into the model two - dimensional space of constant curvature .",
    "the version for curves in euclidean space was also proved independently by sallee  @xcite .",
    "( in  @xcite , not knowing of this earlier work , we stated the result as janse van rensburg s unfolding conjecture . )    the unfoldings of reshetnyak and sallee are always convex curves in the plane .",
    "our cone surface method , given in the proof of proposition  [ prop : unfolding ] , produces an unfolding that need not be convex , as shown in figure  [ fig : unfolding ] .",
    "ghomi and howard have recently extended our argument to prove stronger results about unfoldings  @xcite .",
