    "the solar system planets are oblate in shape due to their rapid rotations . the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius by 7% for jupiter , and by 10% for saturn .",

    "* ) . for a planet in hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", the level of deformation is related to the rotation rate and moment of inertia of the planet , which in turn are influenced by its density profile @xcite .",
    "measuring the oblateness of exoplanets will enable us to better understand their interior structure , as well as their formation and evolutionary history .",
    "previous works @xcite explored the predicted transit light curves of oblate planets .",
    "the transit light curve of an oblate planet a ) is asymmetric about the ingress and egress regions , and b ) will exhibit small differences over ingress and egress to the transit of a spherical planet .",
    "however , it is difficult to photometrically measure the oblateness of an extrasolar planet due to its small amplitude signature . for an optimal case",
    "that a transiting jupiter with planet - to - star radius ratio of 0.15 and a saturn - like oblateness of 0.1 , the maximum deviation between an oblate and a spherical planet transit is 400 parts per million ( ppm ) over the ingress and egress light curve regions @xcite .",
    "the only implementation of oblate transit models to date was carried out by @xcite , with seven transits of the hot jupiter hd  189733b observed by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope_. they were able to rule out a saturn - like oblateness for the planet .",
    "hd  189733b and other hot - jupiters , with orbital semi - major axes @xmath6au , are expected to have spun - down due to tidal dissipation to be tidally locked .",
    "the photometric signatures due to oblateness from these slowly rotating gas giants are too small to be measurable by any current facility .",
    "the unprecedented photometric precision of the _ kepler _ mission has enabled the detections of many subtle photometric effects , such as phase curves of reflected light from planets @xcite , doppler beaming @xcite , and gravity induced asymmetry due to system spin - orbit misalignments @xcite .",
    "the four - year baseline of _ kepler _ also means that observations of planetary transits are no longer restricted to short - period systems .",
    "the possibility of observing the transits of gas giants that are not tidally affected and thus still retain their primordial spin rate motivates a new search for oblateness signals in transit light curves .",
    "this work is the first survey to use _ kepler _ short cadence photometry to measure the oblateness of transiting planets .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows :  2 describes the light curve modeling of a transiting oblate planet , and discusses the detectability of such a signal . ",
    "3 describes the target selection and _ kepler _ light curve reduction procedures .",
    "we apply the oblate planet transit model to _ kepler _ light curves in  4 , first as a signal injection and recovery exercise to demonstrate the detectability of the signal , then to model four selected _ kepler _ planet candidates . in  5 we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "the shape of an oblate planet can be quantified by the flattening , or oblateness , parameter @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the equatorial and polar radii , respectively @xcite .",
    "we also define the effective mean radius to be @xmath11 which is the radius of a spherical planet of the same cross - sectional area .",
    "the planet s spin obliquity , @xmath12 , is defined as the angle between the polar axis of the planet and the orbital angular momentum vector @xcite .",
    "the flattening @xmath7 can be related to the rotation period @xmath13 of a planet with mass @xmath14 by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the quadrupole moment @xcite .",
    "however , what we can measure from transit is not the true flattening and obliquity , but their projected components on the plane of the sky , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , meaning that the constrained oblateness from transit is only a lower limit on the true oblateness . the relations between @xmath7 , @xmath12 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 can be found in @xcite . the definition for the sign of @xmath19 is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : b0-sina ] .",
    "the transit light curve of an oblate planet is described by the intersection between an ellipse and a circle . for the ingress and egress regions of the light curve , where the deviation from a spherical planet model light curve is greatest",
    ", we compute the intersection region using the quasi - monte carlo integration algorithm introduced by @xcite . and @xmath20 , respectively . ] for the in - transit regions , where the planet is fully within the stellar disk",
    ", we replace the oblate planet signal with a spherical planet with the same cross - section area .",
    "since @xmath21 , we assume the spatial limb darkening variation within the area covered by the planet ellipse is negligible .",
    "in fact , the in - transit signal induced by limb darkening is @xmath22 ppm even for planets with substantially large @xmath23 @xcite , which is insignificant for the purpose of model - fitting compared with the noise level ( @xmath24500 ppm ) of _ kepler _ short cadence light curves . by replacing the oblate planet with a spherical planet for the in - transit region",
    ", we are able to speed up the original algorithm introduced by @xcite by a factor of 10 .",
    "we demonstrate in figure  [ fig : examples ] the theoretical oblateness - induced signal for a jupiter - size planet in a 100-day orbit around a sun like star with uniform surface brightness ( i.e. , no limb darkening effect ) .",
    "we assume the planet has a saturn - like oblateness ( @xmath25 , we note that @xmath26 ) .",
    "signals from different projected planet spin obliquities @xmath19 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are plotted for comparison .",
    "we also add an example signal from the oblate planet transiting a limb - darkened stellar surface in figure  [ fig : examples ] , with the in - transit signal considered , to show the influence of the limb darkening effect .    as figure",
    "[ fig : examples ] shows , the oblateness - induced signal is at least an order of magnitude greater over ingress and egress than the in - transit part . the theoretical maximum amplitude of the signal at the ingress / egress part can be estimated by @xmath30 which can be achieved when the impact parameter satisfies the following condition : @xmath31.\\ ] ] the derivation for this expression of the maximum achieved signal is shown in detail in appendix  [ sec : appendix-1 ] .",
    "although equation  ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) is useful in estimating the amplitude of oblateness - induced signal , one should keep in mind that the recovered signal from light curve modeling may have a smaller amplitude due to slight changes in those from other fitting parameters , especially when the oblateness - induced signal is mirror symmetric @xcite .",
    "space - based observations , such as _ kepler _ , can achieve photometric precision comparable to this signal amplitude @xcite , making possible the detection of planetary oblateness when multiple transits are observed .",
    "it is also useful to have a comprehensive understanding of the amplitude of the oblateness signal for arbitrary projected obliquity angles , @xmath19 , and impact parameters , @xmath32 . to achieve that , we simulated theoretical light curves on a grid of @xmath19 and @xmath32 with fixed @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for most of the ranges of @xmath19 and @xmath32",
    "we consider , assuming a moderate projected oblateness @xmath33 ( @xmath35 ) , equation ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) can be written as @xmath36 in figure  [ fig : b0-sina ] we show an example of @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath25 .",
    "this figure tells us that the amplitude of oblateness signal reaches maximum at @xmath39 for a system that is very close to edge - on , and at larger ( absolute ) projected obliquities as the system becomes more inclined . particularly , for @xmath40",
    ", the signal will have maximum amplitude at @xmath41 where the shape of the signal becomes the most asymmetric ( see figure  [ fig : examples ] ) .",
    "this is why the detectability of oblateness is maximized at @xmath42 , as determined numerically by @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath19 where the maximum amplitude of signal is achieved are also the ones where the oblateness can be most tightly constrained",
    ". we will further demonstrate this point in the modeling of simulated signal and real data .",
    "if limb darkening is considered , the maximum amplitude decreases by a factor of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the quadratic limb darkening coefficients @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  2.1 , for a jupiter - size planet ( @xmath46 ) with saturn - like oblateness ( @xmath47 ) , the maximum signal amplitude due to oblateness is @xmath24160 ppm .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for a single transit in the white noise limit can be estimated by @xmath48 in which , @xmath49 is the out - of - transit variation amplitude ( per point ) , @xmath50 denotes the number of observations during the ingress / egress time .",
    "the duration of the ingress / egress time @xmath51 can be estimated by @xmath52    for a 12@xmath53 magnitude star , the _ kepler _ long cadence data can typically achieve a photometric precision of @xmath54 . assuming white noise ,",
    "the equivalent out - of - transit scattering ( @xmath49 ) of the corresponding short cadence data is @xmath55ppm , which corresponds to snr@xmath56 .",
    "we note that this snr estimation is almost exact for short cadence data , with the oblateness - induced signal sufficiently mapped out by the 1 min cadence .",
    "transits having only long cadence data will typically have a much shallower signal than the theoretical value , given the signal duration is roughly comparable to the long integration time ( 30 min ) .",
    "for example , for a jupiter - size planet in a 15-day orbit , the ingress / egress duration is @xmath2430 min , and thus the oblateness signal is strongly suppressed in the long cadence data . for this reason , we do not consider the long cadence data in the present work .    with _ kepler _ light curves from q1-q16 ( @xmath24 1400 day ) , we expect a planet with a 100-day orbital period and a saturn - like oblateness to be detected with a snr  @xmath57 in the white noise limit . in the red noise limit",
    ", snr would scale with the number of transits instead of the number of data points observed , which would reduce the expected snr severely .",
    "we select _ kepler _ planet candidates from q1-q16 @xcite with the following criteria :    \\a ) candidates with radius smaller than 2.0 @xmath58 , to avoid eclipsing binaries ;    \\b ) orbital periods longer than 15 days , such that the spin - orbit synchronization timescale of the planet is greater than 250 myr , assuming a jupiter - mass planet around a solar - mass star @xcite ;    \\c ) the transit is not grazing ( @xmath59 ) , such that the transit system parameters are well constrained ;    \\d ) expected snr for a planet with a saturn like oblateness is higher than 0.5 for a single transit .",
    "we use equation [ eq : snr ] to compute the snr per transit for each candidate .",
    "the ootv value is the point - to - point scatter of the light curve , measured over the regions on either side of the transit event , with width of half transit duration .",
    "the actual expected snr will be multiplied by the square root of the available number of transits from _ kepler _ data .",
    "in addition , we did not select those systems with strong transit timing variations , for it leads to more complexity in the modelling .",
    "11 candidates pass the above threshold , among which , only 3 have short cadence data .",
    "we select these three targets as examples for the modeling .",
    "they are koi 686.01 , koi 197.01 and koi 423.01 ( kepler 39b ) .",
    "we note that these three targets together are not a statistically meaningful sample since our selection criteria are somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we also modeled hat - p-7b ( koi 2.01 ) , despite the fact that it is a hot jupiter and outside of our period selection range , since it will provide a direct comparison to the modeling of hd  189733b in @xcite .    to characterize our detection sensitivity to the oblate planet signals",

    "the koi-368 system , with 110-day period , resembles an ideal system , with near - optimal oblateness snr detectability .",
    "we chose not to fit for oblateness in the actual transits of koi-368.01 , since 1 ) koi-368.01 is an m - dwarf , not a planet , and 2 ) the modeling would require a simultaneous fit of the stellar gravity darkening effect @xcite and the planet oblateness effect , which is outside the scope of this study .",
    "we detrended all the available public _",

    "the injected transits are shifted in time to the same epoches as the true transits .",
    "the simulated null - case transits are then processed in the same way as the observed transits .      to demonstrate the detectability of the oblateness signal , we perform a signal injection and recovery exercise using out - of - transit light curve segments from the koi-368 system .",

    "this suggests that the observed oblateness signal is unlikely to be due to the red noise and stellar oscillations in the light curves .    to check for the consistency of such a signal between epochs",
    ", we choose 11 out of the 12 available observed transits , with epoch + 45 excluded due to spot crossing event ( see the lower panel of figure  [ fig : k423-residuals ] ) , and divide them into three subgroups with three transits in the first subgroup and four in each of the other two , to see if such a `` detection '' appears in each subgroup .",
    "we fit these subgroups simultaneously , such that all subgroups share the same system parameters , but each one has its own independent @xmath33 and @xmath19 values . in total",
    ", we fit 13 free parameters .",
    "the result of this fitting is shown in figure  [ fig:423-subgroups ] .",
    "subgroups 2 and 3 both indicate oblateness detections and they are consistent within @xmath108-@xmath109 level .",
    "subgroup 1 does not show noticeable detection according to the marginalized posterior distribution of @xmath33 , but the asymmetry in the marginalized distribution of @xmath19 as well as the 2d posterior contour between @xmath33 and @xmath19 suggests a potential oblateness detection , which is also consistent with that from the other two subgroups within @xmath108-@xmath109 level .",
    "however , we note that similar exercises performed on the simulated datasets can show inconsistency between epochs . as an example , shown in figure  [ fig:423-subgroups - fk ] , in the null case , one of the three subgroups indicates that a large oblateness is detected , and in the signal - injected case , one subgroup does not show any oblateness detection .",
    "these results suggests that the noise level per subgroup of transits is too high to allow for a robust consistency analysis .",
    "therefore , we conclude that whilst we can not validate the consistency of the observed oblateness signal based on the current data , we can not dismiss such a potential signal either .",
    "in this study , we present the first search for rotationally oblate gas giants in the _ kepler _ planet sample .",
    "the transit light curve of an oblate planet deviates from that of a spheroid primarily over the ingress and egress regions .",
    "we derived an analytical estimate for the amplitude of the deviation from the transit of a spheroid with the same transit parameters ( equation  [ eq : amplitude ] ) . through a signal injection and recovery exercise with the koi-368.01 system",
    ", we showed that the signal of a jupiter - sized planet with a saturn - like oblateness can be detected with _",
    "photometry at a high significance after only a single short cadence transit .",
    "we examined four selected _ kepler _ planets ( candidates ) for signatures of oblateness in their transit light curves .",
    "we find the hot - jupiter hat - p-7b to be consistent to a spheroid , with an overall oblateness constrained to be @xmath2 at the 1-@xmath109 level .",
    "in addition , an oblateness as small as that of neptune ( 0.017 ) can be ruled out at 2-@xmath109 confidence level if the planet is moderately inclined , although at some particular projected obliquities ( @xmath110 and @xmath88 ) , an oblateness up to that of saturn ( 0.1 ) is still allowed within the 2-@xmath109 level .",
    "the oblatenesses of koi 686.01 and koi 197.01 are only weakly constrained due to the high noise level , with overall constraints of @xmath111@xmath112 and @xmath111@xmath113 for the @xmath105 cases , respectively . however , for most spin obliquities for two candidates , we can rule out oblateness larger than that of saturn at the 1-@xmath109 level .",
    "koi 423.01 ( kepler 39b ) shows a potentially large oblateness ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "however , we find that the oblateness signal is only mildly self - consistent over multiple epochs , suggesting that the detection may not be robust .",
    "given the long orbital period of @xmath114 days , and its eccentricity of 0.12 , such an oblateness , if real , is likely to be rotationally , rather than tidally , induced . using equation  [ eq : rotation ] , and the assumptions on the moment of inertia with equation 8 of @xcite",
    ", we estimate the rotation period of koi 423.01 to be @xmath115 hrs , assuming no line - of - sight obliquity . whilst the derived rotation period is high in comparison with solar system gas giants , it is lower than the breakup rotation period of @xmath116 hrs for koi 423.01 .",
    "in addition , @xmath117 pic b was recently measured to have a rotation rate of @xmath118 @xcite . after cooling and contraction ,",
    "the rotational period of the planet is expected to be @xmath56 hrs , similar to our predicted rotation period of koi 423.01 .",
    "we also note that koi 423.01 has a larger - than expected radius @xcite .",
    "its radius is larger by @xmath119 than both theoretical predictions and the radii of similar mass brown dwarfs ( e.g. , corot-3b , * ? ? ?",
    "such a discrepancy can not be solved by invoking an ad hoc increase in the atmospheric opacities because of the fact that koi 423 is metal - poor @xcite , or by tidal heating which only works in very eccentric orbits @xcite . with the fact that a fast rotator is expected to be moderately inflated , we suggest that the discrepancy on koi 423.01 could be explained by the oblateness measurement in this work .",
    "various other effects have the potential of systematically distorting the planet oblateness detection .",
    "the gravity darkening effect can distort the transit light curve slightly , but the distortion appears mostly during the in - transit part of the light curve , and is only detectable for rapidly rotating stars @xcite .",
    "targets selected in this paper are too slowly rotating for gravity darkening to be an important factor .",
    "as for the influence of spot crossings , we note that even when the spot crossing occurs , it is much more likely to happen in the in - transit part than during the ingress / egress session , meaning that the detection of planetary oblateness is hardly affected .",
    "furthermore , such events are in principle visually distinguishable and only affect a fraction of the transits , and thus can be excluded when one wants to do a finer analysis , as we have done in the koi 423 case .",
    "nonetheless , due to the high noise level of the light curve , we could not validate the oblateness detection of koi 423.01  in a high significance level , although the observed transits seem to show consistency between different epochs .",
    "we interpret the detected oblateness of koi 423.01 ( kepler 39b ) , if true , as being due to the preservation of its primordial spin angular momentum .",
    "although we can not constrain the projected spin obliquity of koi-423.01 very well , our results suggest that the spin axis of koi-423.01 is significantly offset from the orbit normal .",
    "whilst this is unexpected if the object is formed by accretion of gases from the protoplanetary disk , we recall that the gas giants in our solar system are tilted to some extent , with the exception of jupiter .",
    "to estimate the spin synchronization timescale of koi 423.01 , we adopt a planet mass of @xmath101 and an eccentricity of 0.12 @xcite .",
    "the expected spin synchronization timescale for this brown dwarf is calculated to be @xmath120 yr , where @xmath121 is the modified @xmath122 value for synchronization .",
    "in order for it not to be tidally spun down within a time scale comparable or longer than the age of its host star ( a few gyr ) , its @xmath123 value must be @xmath124 ( see appendix  [ sec : appendix-2 ] for the details of this estimation ) .",
    "the spin synchronization timescales for the three remaining planetary candidate targets , hat - p-7b , koi 686.01 and koi 197.01 , are @xmath125 yr , @xmath126 yr and @xmath127 yr , respectively . assuming that the ages of their host stars are comparable to that of the sun and that their @xmath128 values are in the range of that ( @xmath129 ) estimated for jupiter and saturn @xcite",
    ", these numbers suggest that hat - p-7b , koi 686.01 and koi 197.01 have been tidally spun down , which is consistent with the non - detection of oblateness of these objects .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for useful comments which helped to improve the manuscript .",
    "we also thank christian clanton and daniel bayliss for comments on the manuscript after carefully reading it through , and andy gould , gaspar bakos , marc pinsonneault , scott gaudi , josh winn and david kipping for insightful discussions .",
    "work by wz was supported by nsf grant ast 1103471 .",
    "this paper used data collected by the kepler mission , funding for which is provided by the nasa science mission directorate .",
    "the signal induced by an oblate planet with respect to the spherical planet with the same ( projected ) cross - section , reaches the maximum when the impact parameter @xmath130 and the projected spin obliquity @xmath19 have the relation depicted in any of the four cases in figure  [ fig : max - signals ] .",
    "the induced signal arises from the differential transit area between the oblate planet and the spherical planet . in figure",
    "[ fig : max - signals ] we mark the maximum differential area as shaded . from geometry",
    "we find this maximum differential area can be written as @xmath131 where @xmath7 is the measured oblateness of the planet , and @xmath132 is the dimensionless mean radius . therefore the differential transit signal , in the absence of limb darkening effect , is @xmath133 in the limit of @xmath134 , we find @xmath135 .\\ ] ]    when the quadratic limb darkening effect is taken into account , the brightness profile is changed to @xmath136 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the quadratic limb darkening coefficients .",
    "since this oblateness - induced signal happens at the ingress / egress part , the brightness of this differential area is therefore decreased by a factor of @xmath137 .",
    "however , the total flux from the stellar plane also decreases from @xmath138 to @xmath139 thus the amplitude of the oblateness signal decreases by a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "dissipation of tidal perturbation by a star with a mass @xmath140 and radius @xmath141 on its planets leads to their orbital synchronization and circulation on time scales @xmath142 @xmath143 , @xmath14 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 are the planet s coefficient of moment of inertia , mass , radius , spin angular frequency , mean motion , orbital semi major axis , eccentricity and orbital period respectively .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 reduces to unity for circular orbits , but they can be significantly larger for highly eccentric orbits@xcite .",
    "the modified @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the planet s love number . in the equilibrium",
    "tidal model@xcite , the planets q - values for synchronization ( @xmath156 ) and circularization ( @xmath157 ) equal to each other",
    ". however , they may attain different values in dynamical tidal models@xcite .    in the limit @xmath158",
    ", @xmath159 is much less than unity for short- and intermediate - period gas giants .",
    "this inequality leads to a possible state of pseudo synchronization in which @xmath160 it also implies that the circularization period ( i.e. , the period out to which the planets orbits are circularized ) is generally much longer than the synchronization time scale ( i.e. , the period out to which the planet s spins are synchronized with their orbital period ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath165 for hat - p-7b@xcite , an upper limit of @xmath166 for koi 686.01 based on the non - detection of radial velocity variations @xcite , @xmath167 for koi 197.01 @xcite and @xmath168 for koi 423.01 @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath169 for hat - p-7b@xcite and 0.62 for koi 686.01 based on the analysis of @xcite .",
    "we also assume @xmath170 for koi 197.01 and @xmath171 for 423.01 .    with these model parameters ,",
    "we obtain @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 for hat - p-7b , koi 686.01 and koi 197.01 , respectively .",
    "these translate to spin synchronization timescales ( @xmath175 ) of 0.02 myr , 1 myr , and 0.32 myr , respectively , assuming the @xmath121 is of order @xmath176 , which is in the range of that estimated for jupiter and saturn @xcite .    however , for the brown dwarf koi 423.01 , @xmath177 yr . the retention of its initial rapid spin requires @xmath178 which is two orders of magnitude larger than those for the planetary companion . in a subsequent paper",
