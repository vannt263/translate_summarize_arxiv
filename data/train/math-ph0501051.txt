    "from the point of view of geometry , the theory of classical general relativity ( see fernando barbero s lectures in this volume ) is the study of riemannian or semi - riemannian geometries ( depending on the choice of euclidean or lorentzian signature ) which satisfy the einstein equations . in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime",
    "these equations for the components @xmath3 of the metric tensor are derived from the einstein ",
    "hilbert action ( r+ ) d^3x [ act ] where integration is over the spacetime manifold , and we have included a cosmological constant @xmath4 . in the first term of the ricci scalar , a contraction of the riemann tensor , appears .",
    "this term may be written as follows : r^__^ _ ^ d^3x [ rie ] where the usual summation convention over repeated indices is used and indices on the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath5 are raised with the inverse metric tensor @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the action in terms of orthonormal dreibeins or triads @xmath7 .",
    "these are a local basis of @xmath8-forms    e^a = e^a_(x )   dx^ , a=1,2,3 [ drei ] such that @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "then the action takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the curvature @xmath13-forms r^ab = r^ab _ dx^dx^and @xmath14 is the riemann tensor that appears in contracted with the dreibein components .    in the dreibein formulation , there is an extra gauge symmetry of local lorentz transformations @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( local , since @xmath17 depends on the point of spacetime ) .",
    "this extra freedom arises since one may simultaneously rotate the three fields @xmath7 , whilst preserving the metric and the condition .",
    "there is a striking similarity between the action in the form ( [ beinaction ] ) and the chern - simons action for a connection @xmath18 in a principal @xmath19-bundle , which has the structure ( fa + a a a ) .",
    "indeed , it was shown by witten @xcite that the action ( [ beinaction ] ) may be interpreted as a chern - simons action for @xmath20 , when @xmath21 ( and for @xmath22 when @xmath23 ) .",
    "the connection in the chern - simons theory is given in terms of the dreibein @xmath7 and spin connection ( or ricci rotation coefficient ) @xmath24 by : a=^abm_ab + e^am_a4 , [ acpt ] where the indices @xmath25 run from @xmath8 to @xmath0 , and @xmath26 is a basis of the lie algebra of @xmath27 .",
    "note that in this so - called first - order formalism , the dreibein @xmath7 and spin connection @xmath24 are independent fields .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a short discussion of the relation between connections and holonomy . given a connection on a principal @xmath19-bundle , a holonomy is an assignment of an element @xmath28 of @xmath19 to each ( based ) loop @xmath29 on the manifold , obtained by lifting the loop into the total space of the bundle and comparing the starting and end points of the lifted loop in the fibre over the basepoint .",
    "holonomy is , in a suitable sense , equivalent to the connection it is derived from .",
    "when the connection is flat , i.e. has zero fieldstrength @xmath30 , the holonomy of @xmath29 only depends on @xmath29 up to homotopy .",
    "thus an efficient way of describing flat connections is to specify a group morphism from the fundamental group of the manifold to the group @xmath19 .",
    "consider the chern - simons action _",
    "ada + a a a [ cs ] on a spacetime of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a closed surface representing space and @xmath33 represents time .",
    "the connection @xmath8-form @xmath18 may be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 are coordinates on @xmath32 , and @xmath36 is the time coordinate . imposing the gauge fixing condition @xmath37 and",
    "the corresponding constraint @xmath38 we see that the connections are flat .",
    "the action now has the structure @xmath39 and therefore `` @xmath18 is its own conjugate momentum '' .",
    "the poisson brackets for the components of @xmath18 ( see equation ) have the following form : @xmath40    we now choose the space manifold to be the torus @xmath41 , and since the group @xmath27 is isomorphic , up to a discrete identification , to the product @xmath42 , we restrict ourselves to studying the phase ( moduli ) space of flat @xmath1 connections on the torus @xmath41 , modulo gauge transformations . note that this is in principle a complicated space to describe , being an infinite - dimensional space divided by an infinite - dimensional group , but in the holonomy picture there is a very simple finite - dimensional description .    since @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are a pair of generating cycles , a holonomy @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , since this determines @xmath49 on any other homotopy class of loops .",
    "the phase space @xmath50 is then @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the remaining gauge freedom , namely @xmath53 for any @xmath54 .    for a single matrix @xmath55",
    "there are four possibilities for how @xmath56 can be conjugated into a standard form :    * @xmath56 has @xmath13 real eigenvalues : @xmath57 * @xmath56 has @xmath8 real eigenvalue with an eigenspace of dimension @xmath13 : @xmath58 * @xmath56 has @xmath8 real eigenvalue with an eigenspace of dimension @xmath8 : @xmath59 * @xmath56 has no real eigenvalues : @xmath60    a similar analysis for a pair of commuting @xmath1 matrices led in @xcite to an explicit parametrization of the classical phase space @xmath50 .",
    "its structure resembles that of a cell complex with , for instance @xmath13-dimensional cells consisting of pairs of diagonal matrices , or pairs of rotation matrices .",
    "however there are also @xmath8-dimensional cells which consist of e.g. pairs of non - diagonalisable matrices of the form : @xmath61 for further details and depictions of @xmath50 see @xcite .",
    "the poisson brackets ( [ pb ] ) are for non - gauge - invariant variables so it is convenient to change to gauge - invariant variables , and an obvious choice are the traced holonomies @xmath62 which are gauge - invariant due to the conjugation invariance of the trace . the holonomy is sometimes written as a path - ordered exponential , or chen integral , @xmath63 and from equation the poisson brackets between the @xmath64 are only non - vanishing if the loops intersect transversally . from trace identities for @xmath65 matrices",
    "it is enough to consider the following three variables : @xmath66 ( which are not independent since they satisfy the identity @xmath67 ) .",
    "their poisson bracket relations are @xcite @xmath68 ( here we have rescaled the variables compared to @xcite to absorb the coupling constants ) .    the first term on the right - hand - side of equation has a geometric interpretation in terms of rerouted loops : e.g. for @xmath69 the two cycles @xmath44 and @xmath45 intersect transversally at one point , and from homotopy invariance of the holonomy @xmath70 is the traced holonomy corresponding to the loop @xmath71 obtained by starting at the basepoint , following @xmath44 to the intersection point @xmath72 , rerouting along the loop @xmath45 back to the intersection point , and finally continuing again along @xmath44 back to the basepoint .",
    "we will see more of these rerouted loops shortly .",
    "we observe that by parametrising the variables as follows : @xmath73 equation ( [ pbt ] ) is solved by setting : @xmath74 on quantization , replacing @xmath75 by operators @xmath76 respectively implies the corresponding commutation relation : @xmath77 = i \\hbar . \\label{rcommrel}\\ ] ]    the operators @xmath78 satisfy a @xmath2-deformed ( @xmath79 ) cubic relation , which can be interpreted in terms of a quantum casimir operator for the quantum group @xmath80 - see @xcite .",
    "we note that e.g. @xmath81 so that by introducing the _ quantum _ matrices @xmath82 we have the analogous relation between @xmath78 and @xmath83 , namely @xmath84 we also notice that these quantum matrices satisfy the following fundamental relation : @xmath85 where we are using matrix multiplication of operator - valued matrices ( the usual algebraic rule , but paying strict attention to the order of the symbols ) .",
    "for example , the relation @xmath86 follows from the commutation relation between the operators @xmath87 .",
    "the cubic constraint satisfied by the quantum variables @xmath78 is rather complicated , so instead we work with the quantum holonomy matrices @xmath83 themselves rather than with the trace functions @xmath78 .",
    "it is important to note that even though the quantum matrices @xmath83 are not gauge - invariant , i.e. @xmath88 for general @xmath72 , the fundamental equation ( [ fund ] ) is gauge - covariant , and is also covariant under the modular symmetry of the theory , i.e. the group of large diffeomorphisms of the torus - see @xcite .",
    "thus our idea is to substitute invariant variables obeying complicated equations by non - invariant matrix variables satisfying natural @xmath2-commutation relations like the fundamental relation ( [ fund ] ) . certainly for the case of diagonal matrices these two viewpoints are entirely equivalent .",
    "we have also studied , in @xcite , what happens when one imposes the fundamental equation for a pair of upper - triangular quantum matrices , which should correspond , in some sense , to the quantization of the @xmath8-dimensional upper - triangular cell of the classical phase space mentioned in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "if one parametrizes the quantum matrices @xmath83 as follows : @xmath89 where the @xmath90 are operators to be determined , a solution to equation is given by : @xmath91 note the change of sign in the argument of @xmath92 in the last of equations .",
    "it can be checked , from that @xmath93 as required , but we also get an _ internal _ commutation relation @xmath94 for the elements of @xmath95 and similarly for @xmath96 , which curiously does not involve the quantum parameter @xmath97 .    note that it is impossible to find solutions to with @xmath98 , the unit operator , by naive analogy with equation , since @xmath99 .",
    "thus in terms of the number of quantum parameters , this upper - triangular sector would appear to be as substantial as the triangular sector , unlike the classical case .",
    "finally we remark that in @xcite , we studied equations like ( [ upptriang ] ) from an algebraic point of view , and found that their solutions have several interesting properties analogous to quantum groups .",
    "here we briefly describe our most recent work - for a full treatment see @xcite . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we only considered the quantum matrices assigned to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so it is natural to try and understand how to assign quantum matrices to other loops , and to study the relationships between them . a useful way of doing this , proposed in @xcite , is to introduce a constant quantum connection @xmath100 where constant means that the @xmath87 do not depend on the spatial coordinates @xmath101 of the torus .",
    "then the assignment of a quantum matrix to any loop is given by the holonomy of this connection along the loop : _",
    "[ hol ] it can easily be seen that reproduces the quantum matrices @xmath83 of equation ( [ ui ] ) , if @xmath44 is the loop with @xmath102 coordinate constant and @xmath103 running from @xmath104 to @xmath8 , and @xmath45 is the loop with @xmath103 constant and @xmath102 running from @xmath104 to @xmath8 .",
    "it is convenient to identify the torus @xmath41 with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 consists of points with integer @xmath103 and @xmath102 coordinates .",
    "we consider all loops on the torus represented by piecewise - linear ( pl ) paths between integer points on the @xmath107 plane , and work with this description , keeping in mind that paths represent loops .",
    "in particular the integer paths denoted @xmath108 are straight paths between @xmath109 and @xmath108 with @xmath110 integers .",
    "thus for example we assign to the integer path @xmath111 the quantum matrix @xmath112    consider two homotopic loops @xmath44 and @xmath45 corresponding to pl paths both starting at @xmath109 and ending at the same integer point in the plane .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there is the following relationship between the respective quantum matrices : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the signed area enclosed between the paths @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "for example , the exponent ( the number @xmath8 ) of @xmath2 in the fundamental relation is the signed area between two paths around the perimeter of the unit square , starting at @xmath109 and ending at @xmath115 , the first via @xmath116 and the second via @xmath117 .",
    "the traces of these quantum matrices also exhibit commutation relations with interesting properties .",
    "let @xmath118 ( note we have dropped the factor @xmath119 for easier comparison with the goldman result below ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the following commutation relation holds : @xmath120= ( q^{\\frac{mt - ns}{2}}-q^{-\\frac{mt - ns}{2 } } ) \\left(\\hat{t}(m+s , n+t ) - \\hat{t}(m - s , n - t)\\right ) \\label{qgb1}\\ ] ]    there are some surprising geometric aspects to equation .",
    "the number @xmath121 appearing in the exponents is the signed area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors @xmath108 and @xmath122 .",
    "the same expression equals the suitably - defined total intersection number ( including and counting multiplicities ) of the two loops represented by the paths @xmath108 and @xmath122 .",
    "equation can , in fact , be viewed as a quantization of a bracket due to goldman @xcite for the loops corresponding to such integer paths .",
    "this bracket is a poisson bracket for the functions @xmath123 given by : \\{t(_1 ) , t(_2 ) } = _ s _ 1 _ 2 ( _ 1,_2,s)(t(_1s_2 ) - t(_1s_2 ^ -1 ) ) [ gold ] where @xmath124 denotes the set of transversal intersection points of @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath125 is their intersection index for the intersection point @xmath72 . in equation @xmath126 and @xmath127 denote the loops which follow @xmath44 and are rerouted along @xmath45 , or its inverse , at the intersection point @xmath72 as described previously . for the integer loops considered here , all the rerouted loops @xmath128 are homotopic to the integer loop @xmath129 , with an analogous statement for the loops @xmath127 .",
    "it follows that the classical goldman bracket can be written as @xmath130 therefore the first factor on the right hand side of ( [ qgb1 ] ) may be thought of as a quantum total intersection number for the loops @xmath108 and @xmath122 .",
    "we remark that in @xcite we also derived a different form of where each rerouted loop appears separately .",
    "the different terms are related by the same area phases as in ( [ areaphase ] ) . in these proofs",
    "we used a classical geometric result @xcite namely pick s theorem ( 1899 ) , which expresses the area @xmath131 of a lattice polygon @xmath50 with vertices at integer lattice points of the plane in terms of the number of interior lattice points @xmath132 and the number of boundary lattice points @xmath133 as follows : @xmath134 full details are given in @xcite .",
