    "laser cooling and manipulation of neutral atoms is one of the priority field of atom optics . in the recent time",
    "the major developments and success have been obtained in atom lithography and direct deposition of atoms utilizing light fields as an immaterial optical mask for atomic beam @xcite . in most nanofabrication experiments ,",
    "atomic structures are realized by far off detuned periodical conservative potential created by intense laser fields acting as an array of immaterial light lenses for the atoms .",
    "the influence of the spontaneous emission on the focusing is considered to be negligible because of the large light detuning and short interaction times .",
    "in essence , the atom trajectory affected by conservative dipole force without any loses ( or dissipation ) of energy in the atomic beam . in this case",
    "the atomic beam focusing has a classical analogy and can be described with methods developed for particle optics @xcite . as in normal optics ,",
    "the feature size is limited by a combination of chromatic aberration caused by the broad longitudinal and transverse velocity distribution of an atomic beam .",
    "therefore an additional laser cooling field is required to prepare a well collimated and transversely cooled atomic beam to minimize deleterious effects . additionally , because of spherical aberration some atoms do not focus well and contribute to pedestal background .",
    "these factors are dominant and do not allow one to reach the theoretically predicted diffraction limit for atom optics determined by de broglie wavelength of atoms , only a few picometres . therefore the new alternative methods for atom lithography are intensively investigated .",
    "recently , the idea of combining the traditional focusing method with the well known concept of laser cooling was suggested for a blue detuned intensive light field @xcite and was mentioned earlier in @xcite . here the intense light field , commonly used for focusing , was used to create a deep optical potential .",
    "additional dissipative light force provides additional cooling of the atoms to the minimum of optical potential at blue detuning .",
    "the characteristic time when the dissipation processes take effect is a few inverse recoil frequencies @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is recoil energy , gained by an atom with mass @xmath2 at rest after emission of a photon with momentum @xmath3 ) .",
    "this time is several tens of microseconds for the number of elements with closed dipole optical transitions suitable for laser cooling .",
    "thus for commonly used atomic beams with thermal longitudinal velocity it might be difficult to realize this type of dissiaptive optical mask experimentally due to power limitations of laser system used .    in the following we consider the alternative regime of dissipative optical mask , created by red detuned low intensity light field with nonuniform polarization .",
    "it is well known that low intensity light field with polarization gradients can be used for sub - doppler laser cooling of neutral atoms .",
    "this mechanism of laser cooling is well understood and has been thoroughly studied by a number of authors @xcite especially with respect to the temperature of laser cooling , the atomic momentum distribution , and the localization @xcite that can be measured by spectroscopy methods @xcite . due to the extremely complex master equation for the quantum description of atomic motion in light fields the secular approximation @xcite was initially suggested is valid in the limit @xcite @xmath4 this limit assumes the energy separation between different energy bands of atoms in optical potential are much greater then their width due to optical pumping and tunneling effects . here",
    "the light - shift well depth @xmath5 define the optical potential depth .",
    "@xmath6 is the detuning between the laser @xmath7 and atomic transition @xmath8 frequencies , and @xmath9 is the radiative decay rate .",
    "this approximation is valid , for a given potential depth , in the limit of large detuning . on the contrary , it might failed in a deep potential at given detuning .",
    "more over , even if the secular approximation is well fulfilled for the lowest vibrational levels it might break down for upper ones where the separation between energy bands becomes smaller due to potential anharmonicity effects , and especially for above - barrier motioned atoms .    in the present work we investigate the applicability of laser cooling in a deep optical potential created by light field with nonuniform polarization for generating spatially localized atom structures with high contrast for atom lithography .",
    "we consider the conditions far from the situation of extremely low sub - doppler cooling cases .",
    "thus , to describe the localization of atoms more correctly in here we do not restrict our consideration by secular approximation . rather we perform a full quantum numerical analysis of generalized optical bloch equation for atomic density matrix elements . in particular ,",
    "we consider the light field parameters beyond the secular approximation limit .",
    "finally we analyze the structure width and contrast of localized atoms , important parameters for technological applications .",
    "let us consider one - dimensional ( along the z axis ) motion of atoms with total angular momenta @xmath10 in the ground state and @xmath11 in the excited state in a field of two oppositely propagating waves with the same frequency and intensity @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the amplitude of each of the oppositely propagating waves .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 determine their polarizations with components @xmath16 in cyclic basis @xmath17 .    in this work",
    "we restrict our consideretion by the weak - field limit , i.e. with small saturation parameter @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the single - beam rabi frequency characterize the coupling between the atomic dipole @xmath20 and light field .    in the weak - field limit",
    ", the atomic exited - state can be adiabatically eliminated , and atom motion is describing by reduced equation for the ground - state density matrix elements @xcite : @xmath21+{\\hat \\gamma}\\{{\\hat \\rho}\\}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 the last term in ( [ ham ] ) describes atoms interaction with the light field in resonance approximation , where @xmath24 and operator @xmath25 is written through the clebsch - gordan coefficients : @xmath26 written in the basis of sublevel wave functions for exited @xmath27 and the ground @xmath28 atomic states .",
    "in addition , the relaxation part of kinetic equation for atomic density matrix ( [ equation ] ) has the following form @xmath29 where @xmath30 standard anticommutator definition and @xmath31 is position operator .",
    "this term describes redistribution of the atom on the ground state energy sublevels with taking into account the recoil effects in spontaneous photon emission .",
    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 is determined by the probability of emission of a photon with polarization @xmath34 into direction @xmath35 ( relative to the @xmath36 axis ) .",
    "there are number of approaches developed for calculation of the evolution of the atomic density matrix .",
    "the quantum problem is more difficult because it incorporate evolution of numbers of internal and external components of the density matrix .",
    "the majority of works are based on secular approximation for density matrix elements @xcite .",
    "it consists in the following : first , the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the hamiltonian @xmath22 should be found .",
    "then we can consider only the evolution of diagonal elements of atomic density matrix in this eigenstatas basis .",
    "it can be written in a form of balance equation with the rates characterizing the relaxation part of the master equation .",
    "the secular approximation for the general master equation ( [ equation ] ) is valid for the lowest vibrational energy levels when the the energy separation between different bands are much greater than the effective width due to optical width and tunneling effects .",
    "this condition implies very large detuning .",
    "however , the density of energy states increases for the upper energy levels and the energy difference between adjacent states could be very small @xcite .",
    "this circumstances therefore make very hard to use the secular approximation for describing of hot and nonlocalized atomic fraction .    in order to take into account effects of localization in optical potential and modulation depth of the spatial distribution of atoms",
    "more correctly we utilize a different approach for the quantum calculation of the master equation ( [ equation ] ) .    in the wigner representation for atomic density matrix @xmath37 the general master equation ( [ equation ] ) takes the following form : @xmath38    - \\frac{\\gamma \\,s}{2 } \\left\\{\\hat{v}^{\\dagger } \\hat{v } , \\hat{\\rho}\\right\\ } + \\hat{\\gamma}\\{\\hat{\\rho}\\}\\ ] ] where commutator of density matrix with kinetic part of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) reduces to partial deviation on @xmath36 @xmath39 the field part of hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) has only the zeroth and the second spatial harmonics : @xmath40 thus the commutator and anticommutator in the right hand side of equation ( [ wigner ] ) could be written as : @xmath41 the last term describing relaxation due to spontaneous emission of photons has well - known form in wigner representation : @xmath42 { \\hat t}_q \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ wigner ] ) admits solution that is periodic in the position variable .",
    "we further introduce a fourier - series expantion for atomic density matrix in spatial coordinates @xmath43 and rewrite the master equation for discrete fourier components of density matrix @xmath44 : @xmath45    in steady - state problem ( @xmath46 ) such a recursion may often be solved by the method of continued fraction .",
    "this approach is used for solution of the optical - bloch equations in different spectroscopy tasks as well as for the calculation of the force on atom in the light field ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the major distinction here is that these equations for density matrix contain the recoil effects that makes them more complicated for calculation .",
    "additionally we note , the similar approach was described in @xcite where the authors analyzed the laser cooling ( velocity distribution ) of two - level atom in the recoil limit and thus restrict their consideration only by the zeroth spatial harmonics for the ground state density matrix . in our case",
    "the number of the spatial harmonics depends on the light field and atomic parameters .",
    "typically we use less than @xmath47 harmonics that is enough to obtain the spatial solution for equilibrium atomic density matrix in considered range of light field parameters .",
    "the spatial and momentum steady - state distribution of atoms with @xmath48 optical transition for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and chromium mass are shown in fig.[fig1](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the fig.[fig1](c ) represents the total population of spatial harmonics of atomic ground - state density matrix integrated over momentum space @xmath51 .",
    "the zeroth harmonic is equal to @xmath52 that is the normalization condition . as it seen here the population of higher harmonics are rapidly decrease with number @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we turn our attention to the steady - state spatial distribution of the atoms in the optical potential created by the light field with @xmath54 configuration .",
    "we choose this configuration as a brightest example of the light field with nonuniform polarization .",
    "only light field ellipticity varies in position space while the other parameters ( intensity , phase , orientation of polarization vector ) stay unchanged .",
    "more over , the optical potential created by this field configuration has a period of @xmath55 that makes it very attractive for deposition of atomic structures with high spatial periodicity .",

    "these are the atomic mass @xmath2 , the wavelength @xmath57 , and the natural line - width @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , there are two light - field parameters in the low - field limit : detuning @xmath79 , and saturation parameter @xmath80 .",
    "it is possible to choose reduced dimensionless units ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) , so that the dimensionless atomic mass @xmath56 can be defined from relation @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this is so called a quasiclassical parameter that characterizes an atom s kinetic in a light field . in particular",
    ", it describes the rate of kinetic processes and evolution of atomic distribution function in momentum space , thus the typical cooling time is order of @xmath85 .",
    "we perform an analysis of the effects of atom localization in optical potential .",
    "contrast can be defined as the ratio of spatial distribution modulation depth to its amplitude @xmath86 ( fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) ) as in @xcite . as it can be seen directly from ( [ wigner ] )",
    ", there are only two parameters that characterize the stationary solution for an atomic density matrix .",
    "this is the detuning , that can be measured in the units of natural line - width @xmath87 and the second one is non - dimensional parameter @xmath88 : @xmath89 this scale parameter makes it possible to implement the results of calculation for the elements with allowed closed dipole optical transition having degeneration over the angular momentum energy levels ( table i ) .",
    "note , that in the secular approximation @xcite the stationary solution is characterized only by the ratio of optical potential depth to recoil energy @xmath90 that is proportional to @xmath91 in our notations .",
    "thus we first express the results in parameters @xmath92 and @xmath91 . as it seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the differences between the curves become more significant with the optical potential depth @xmath5 increasing , corresponding to out of framework from secular approach .",
    "the width of the localized structures and the contrast tends to an asymptotic constant value with increasing of the light field intensity , however that depends on light field detuning . in order to find the asymptotic values for the width we fit curves with an empirical low @xmath93 .",

    "[ fig4 ] represents the fwhm width and contrast of the spatial structures as a function of parameter @xmath88 at different detunings for the atomic model with @xmath95 optical transition .",
    "the fwhm width of the spatial structures is monotone decrease for a large detuning and parameter @xmath88 . in spite of the fact that the equilibrium temperature is growing with the depth of optical potential ,",
    "the localization of the atoms becomes stronger with growth of these parameters .",
    "additionally the contrast tends towards its maximum value fig . [",
    "fig4](b ) .",
    "the dashed vertical lines on the fig.[fig4 ] underline the limitations of the weak - field theory for different elements from the table i in assumption @xmath96 .",
    "note , that this is qualitative assumption . for thorough analysis of the weak - field theory limits the solution of the quantum equation for the total atomic density matrix is required with taking into account exited state population .",
    "however , the width and contrast curves fig.[fig4 ] have a very strong dependence on @xmath88 , thus the localization effects remain rather significant for enough small saturation parameter especially for `` heavy '' atoms table i.",
    "we performed the fully quantum analysis of atomic localization obtained by laser cooling in nonuniformly polarized low - intensity light field .",
    "generally , conditions for a deep laser cooling mismatch conditions for strong atomic localization that require deeper optical potential and consequently leads to higher laser cooling temperature . additionally , in a deep optical potential the secular approximation ( [ sec ] ) restricted by relation on light field detuning and the depth of optical potential .",
    "in our treatment we had no such limitation allowing a more correctly describe the spatial solution for atomic distribution function including localized and above - barrier motioned atoms .",

    "we showed that the atomic structure width and contrast have a strong dependence on @xmath88 and tend to constant values with an increasing optical potential dept that depends on the light field detuning .",
    "we demonstrated the applicability of laser cooling in far - off detuned deep optical potential , created by a light field with polarization gradient , as a dissipative optical mask for the purposes of atom lithography and nanofabrication for generation of spatially localized atomic features with high contrast .",
    "this type of the light mask can be an alternative method for creation of spatially localized atomic structures .",
    "the remarkable distinction of this method from previous non - dissipative light mask is that the suggested one is not sensitive to any aberration effects .",
    "more over , this type of optical mask has no classical analog and can not be described by methods for classical optics .",
