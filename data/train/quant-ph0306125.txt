    "following the theoretical formulation of quantum computing @xcite and the first algorithms for problems which can be solved more easily on a quantum computer than on a classical computer @xcite the practical implementation of such a device has become a challenging task .",
    "initial steps have already been taken .",
    "quantum bits ( qubits ) can be realised for instance by storing the information in a superposition of the internal states of two - level atoms .",
    "however building systems with many coupled qubits remains a huge challenge .",
    "many demands must be met : reliable qubit storage , preparation and measurement , gate operations with high fidelity and low failure rate and scalability of the system to many qubits .",
    "the biggest problem is posed by decoherence which can cause the loss of information .    in this paper",
    "we review the idea of quantum computing using dissipation @xcite which might help to overcome the decoherence problem in some systems . on the contrary",
    ", it might even be useful to introduce an additional spontaneous decay channel into a system in order to create a realm of new possibilities to implement gate operations between qubits . to illustrate this we present a scheme for the realisation of quantum computing between cold trapped ions in the presence of cooling .",
    "the ions are stored inside a linear trap and each qubit is obtained from two different ground states of the same ion , as in @xcite .    in the quantum computing scheme proposed here , the role of cooling during gate operations is twofold .",
    "on one hand it decreases the sensitivity of the scheme with respect to heating @xcite . on the other hand , the presence of the cooling lasers introduces a decay channel into the system whose presence leads to a restriction of the time evolution of the system onto the computational subspace and facilitates the possibility for quantum gate implementations within one step .",
    "the probability for photon emission is relatively small since the system remains to a good approximation within a decoherence - free subspace @xcite .",
    "if heating nevertheless populates the vibrational mode or gate failure moves the system out of the decoherence - free subspace , then photons are emitted at a high rate @xcite .",
    "this can be detected and the computation can be restarted .",
    "many schemes for quantum computing with trapped ions have already been proposed .",
    "some of them require cooling of the ions into the ground state of a common vibrational mode . that this is possible has been demonstrated recently in innsbruck @xcite , where the cirac - zoller controlled - not quantum gate @xcite has been implemented with the help of six concatenated laser pulses individually addressing each of the two ions . at the same time",
    ", the group in boulder demonstrated a robust , high - fidelity geometric two ion - qubit phase gate in the laboratory .",
    "this was achieved with a sequence of laser pulses and without individual addressing of the ions @xcite . but",
    "are these schemes really suitable for quantum computation with many qubits ? finding reliable ways to scale present schemes to many qubits might require further simplifications of the experimental setup without decreasing the precision of gate operations .",
    "before we discuss the coherent control of an open quantum system with the help of dissipation in more detail , let us first introduce the theoretical model for describing the time evolution of the system under the condition of no photon emission .",
    "we give a short review of the quantum jump method @xcite which is equivalent to the monte carlo wave - function @xcite and the quantum trajectory @xcite approaches @xcite .      in the last decades",
    ", several quantum optics experiments have been performed studying the statistics of photons emitted by _",
    "single _ quantum mechanical systems , like one or two laser - driven trapped atoms or ions .",
    "effects have been found that would be averaged out in the statistics of photons emitted by a whole _",
    "ensemble _ and which can not be predicted with the help of expectation values calculated for a statistical ensemble @xcite .",
    "new formalisms describing single systems interacting with the environment had to be developed .    a typical example for such an experiment is electron shelving @xcite , i.e. the occurance of stochastic macroscopic light and dark periods in the resonance fluorescence of a laser - driven atom with a metastable state .",
    "another example is the two - atom double - slit experiment by eichmann _",
    "@xcite which demonstrated that the photons emitted by two atoms at a fixed distance can create an interference pattern on a distant screen .",
    "these experiments suggest that the effect of the environment on the state of the atoms is the same as the effect of rapidly repeated measurements of whether a photon has been emitted or not @xcite . from this assumption",
    "the quantum jump approach has been derived .",
    "assume that a measurement is performed on a quantum optical system surrounded by a free radiation field initially in its vaccum state @xmath0 and prepared in @xmath1 determining after a time @xmath2 whether or not a photon has been created . if @xmath3 is the hamiltonian including the interaction of the system with its environment , the state of the system equals @xmath4 under the condition that the free radiation field is still in the vacuum state .",
    "for quantum optical experiments , it has been shown that the dynamics under the conditional time evolution operator @xmath5 , defined by the right hand side of ( [ def ] ) , can be summarised by a hamiltonian @xmath6 that is largely independent of the choice of @xmath2 .",
    "the conditional hamiltonian @xmath6 is non - hermitian and the norm of a state vector developing with @xmath6 decreases in general in time . under the condition of no photon emission ,",
    "the state of the system equals at time @xmath7 latexmath:[\\[\\label{seq }     for convenience , @xmath6 has been defined such that @xmath9 is the probability for no photon emission in @xmath10 .",
    "the non - hermiticity of the conditional hamiltonian @xmath6 and the continuous decrease of the amplitude of the unnormalised state vector @xmath11 reflect that the observation of no photons reveals information about the system .",
    "the longer no photon is emitted the more unlikely it becomes that there is excitation that might cause an emission and the amplitudes of states with spontaneous decay rates decrease exponentially @xcite .       and @xmath12 of one ion .",
    "in addition a metastable state @xmath13 , a rapidly decaying state @xmath14 with decay rate @xmath15 and two strong laser fields with coupling strength @xmath16 and detuning @xmath17 are required . ]",
    "the level scheme of the two cold trapped ions that we consider in this paper in order to discuss the role of dissipation in quantum gate realisations is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "each qubit is obtained from two different atomic ground states @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the same ion .",
    "in addition , a metastable state @xmath20 and a rapidly decaying level 3 are required .",
    "first , the ions have to be cooled into the ground state of a common vibrational mode .",
    "two strong laser fields detuned by the frequency @xmath17 of a common vibrational mode should be applied . the laser field coupling to the 1 - 2 transition establishes a coupling between the two qubits involved in the gate operation .",
    "the laser field driving the 1 - 3 transition represents the laser cooling setup and can be replaced by any other laser cooling configuration without changing the effective time evolution of the system .    in the following ,",
    "we denote the spontaneous decay rate of level 3 by @xmath15 while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the annihilation and creation operator of a phonon in the common vibrational mode .",
    "the coupling constant of this mode to the atomic 1-@xmath23 transition equals @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rabi frequency of the applied laser field and @xmath26 is the lamb dicke parameter depending on the characteristics of the ion trap .",
    "proceeding as in @xcite , one finds that the conditional hamiltonian within the dipole and the rotating wave approximation and in the interaction picture with respect to the free hamiltonian equals @xmath27 - \\sum_{i=1}^2 { \\textstyle{{\\rm i } \\over 2 } } \\hbar \\gamma_3 \\ ,",
    "|3 \\rangle_i\\langle 3| ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the lamb - dicke regime and the condition @xmath28 , @xmath29 has been assumed , as in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of _ quantum computing using dissipation _ is to utilise the _ coherent _ no - photon time evolution given by @xmath6 for the implementation of gate operations .",
    "whenever a photon emission occurs the computation fails and has to be repeated .",
    "nevertheless , we show that fidelities @xmath30 and success rates @xmath31 close to one can be achieved for a wide range of experimental parameters .",
    "the reason that spontaneous emission from the ions is in the following negligible is that the system remains during the whole computation in a decoherence - free ( df ) state @xcite . in this section",
    "we define df states and describe a mechanism which restricts the time evolution of a system onto its decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) .",
    "the dfs of a system is a subspace of states whose population does not lead to decoherence . using the quantum jump approach ,",
    "a state @xmath1 is df if @xmath32 for all times @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "hence , the dfs is spanned by the eigenvectors of the conditional hamiltonian with real eigenvalues @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath34 of @xmath6 are in general non - orthogonal .",
    "it is therefore useful to introduce the reciprocal basis vectors @xmath35 with @xmath36 and to write the conditional hamiltonian as @xmath37 suppose that all non - df states couple strongly to the environment and populating them leads typically to a photon emission within a time @xmath2 . the time @xmath2 is greater than a certain minimal size which can be determined from the quantum jump approach .",
    "provided that the eigenvalues @xmath38 corresponding to non - df states fulfil the condition @xmath39 the no - photon time evolution operator becomes @xcite @xmath40 this operator projects every initial state onto the dfs .",
    "the action of the environment over a time @xmath2 can therefore be interpreted as a measurement whether the system is df or not .",
    "the probability for no emission in @xmath2 equals the probability to be in a df state .",
    "these continuous measurements caused by the environment lead to a realm of possibilities to manipulate a system within the dfs . actually , any arbitrary interaction can be used as long as its typical time scale is much longer than @xmath2 defined by condition ( [ ass ] ) @xcite .",
    "this restriction of the system onto the dfs can intuitively be understood with the help of the quantum zeno effect @xcite . within @xmath2 , a weak interaction can only transfer population proportional @xmath2 out off the dfs . during the next measurement",
    "the system is found in a non - df state with a probability proportional @xmath41 .",
    "otherwise it is projected back onto the dfs by the time evolution operator ( [ ups ] ) .",
    "important is that the probability to find the system always in a df state , i.e. @xmath42 times if @xmath43 is the gate operation time , goes in the limit of weak interactions , i.e. for @xmath44 , to one .",
    "however , the time evolution of the system inside the dfs is not inhibited . using first order perturbation theory with respect to the weak interaction , ( [ ups ] ) and the assumption that the system is initially in a df state",
    ", one can show that the conditional time evolution in @xmath2 is the same as the one that one obtains from the hamiltonian @xmath45 using the same approximations . here",
    "@xmath46 is the projector onto the dfs .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath47 is used in the following to find the appropriate laser configuration for the realisation of certain gate operations .",
    "one motivation among others to use an environment - induced quantum zeno effect for quantum computing is the simplicity of the resulting schemes .",
    "as we see in the next section , the dfs of the cold - ion system contains in addition to all ground states , highly entangled states . through populating these states entanglement between qubits",
    "can be created during the effective time evolution even if this is in general not possible using only a single laser pulse .",
    "let us now estimate the probability of finding the result of a whole computation assuming that each gate can be performed with maximum fidelity ( as it applies as long as the corrections to the desired effective time evolution are not too big @xcite ) but only with a finite success rate @xmath31 .",
    "the probability of implementing an algorithm of @xmath48 gates faultlessly is @xmath49 and grows exponentially with @xmath48 . on the other hand , if one always knows whether an algorithm has failed or not , the computation can be repeated until a result is obtained . the probability for not having a result after @xmath50 runs equals @xmath51 for large @xmath48 this is approximately @xmath52 .",
    "many repetitions might be necessary to implement a computation . however , for smaller numbers of @xmath48 and if @xmath31 is sufficiently close to unity , the failure probability is already nearly negligible for @xmath53 .",
    "for example , if @xmath54 and an algorithm with @xmath55 gates is performed , then repeating the computation 50 times yields a success rate above @xmath56 .",
    "we now consider again the concrete setup described in subsection [ trap ] and describe the realisation of two - qubit quantum gates between cold trapped ions in the presence of cooling with the help of additional weak laser fields .        to realise gate operations between the two qubits formed by the ground states of the ions weak laser fields",
    "are applied in addition to the strong lasers shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "let us denote the rabi frequency of the laser with respect to the @xmath23 - 2 transition in ion @xmath62 by @xmath63 and assume that @xmath64 the conditional hamiltonian @xmath6 of the system then becomes the sum of the hamiltonian ( [ hlaseri ] ) and the laser hamiltonian @xmath65 if the time evolution of the system is restricted onto the dfs , as predicted in the previous section , then it is effectively given by the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) which equals @xmath66 \\ , \\langle a| + { \\rm h.c . }",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this hamiltonian can be used to implement quantum gate operations if the operation time @xmath43 is chosen such that at the end of each gate again only qubit states are populated .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the no - photon time evolution of the ions is given in @xcite .",
    "as a concrete example we consider the controlled not ( cnot ) gate .",
    "if ion 1 contains the target qubit and ion 2 provides the control qubit this gate corresponds to the time evolution operator @xmath67 the easiest way to realise a cnot gate is to couple one laser with the ( real ) rabi frequency @xmath68 to the 1 - 2 transition of ion 1 and another one with the same rabi frequency to the 0 - 2 transition of ion 2 which yields the effective hamiltonian @xmath69 \\ , \\langle a|   + { \\rm h.c . }",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the duration of the laser pulse equals @xmath70 the resulting time evolution can be shown to be exactly the desired operation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] results from a numerical solution of the no - photon time evolution given by the sum of the hamiltonians ( [ hlaseri ] ) and ( [ hint ] ) .",
    "for very small rabi frequencies , the gate success rate and fidelity is for all initial states close to one . for larger values of @xmath71 ,",
    "the @xmath72 decreases and is for @xmath73 as low as @xmath74 .",
    "the gate fidelity is in this case still above @xmath75 .",
    "the smallest gate success rate is found when the atoms are initially in @xmath76 , @xmath77 or in a superposition of these two states . in general , success rates @xmath78 are achieved as long as @xmath79 .     for @xmath80 , @xmath81 and for the initial qubit states @xmath82 ( a ) , @xmath76 ( b ) and @xmath83/\\sqrt{2}$ ] ( c ) .",
    "if the ions are initially prepared in @xmath84 , the gate success rate equals one . for @xmath85",
    "the fidelity is about the same as in graph ( c ) . ]    finally , we would like to comment on the role of the spontaneous decay rate of level 3 in the scheme .",
    "figure [ fig22 ] shows the fidelity of a single cnot gate as a function of @xmath15 and for @xmath80 . in the chosen parameter regime",
    ", the effective damping rate of unwanted population in non - df states can be shown to equal @xmath86 to a very good approximation and the effective decay rate of non - df states increases linearly in @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig22 ] confirms that the presence of the auxiliary dissipation channels is crucial for the scheme to work ! for small damping rates the mechanism which restricts the time evolution of the system onto the computational subspace fails and the minimum gate fidelity is well below @xmath87 .",
    "the paper reviews the idea of quantum computing using dissipation which offers a great variety of possibilities to implement gate operations in the presence of only one dissipation channel in a system . as an example we described the possibility to implement precise quantum gates between cold trapped ions in the presence of cooling of a common vibrational mode and within one step . because of its simplicity and robustness against parameter fluctuations @xcite ,",
    "the proposed scheme might help to increase the number of qubits in present quantum computing experiments .",
