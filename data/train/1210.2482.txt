    "contrary to the classical pearson correlation coefficient , the population distance covariance vanishes only in the case of independence , and it applies to random vectors of arbitrary dimensions , rather than to univariate quantities only .",

    "the square of the sample distance covariance equals the average entry in the componentwise or schur product of the two centered distance matrices .",
    "given the theoretical appeal of the population quantity , and the striking simplicity of the sample version , it is not surprising that the distance covariance is experiencing a wealth of applications , despite having been introduced merely half a decade ago .",

    "clearly , the population affinely invariant distance correlation and its sample version are invariant under the group of invertible affine transformations , and in addition to satisfying this often - desirable group invariance property ( eaton , 1989 ) , they inherit the desirable properties of the standard distance dependence measures .",

    "computer code for calculating these sample versions is available in an r package by rizzo and szkely ( 2011 ) .",
    "now let @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the usual sample covariance matrices of the data @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",

    "the _ sample affinely invariant distance correlation _ is defined by @xmath71 if the quantities in the numerator are strictly positive , and defined to be zero otherwise .",

    "now we can separate the three sums in the decomposition of szkely , et al .",

    "then , @xmath96 and @xmath97 tend to zero and the remaining averages converge to constants ( representing some distance correlation components ) almost surely as @xmath87 , and this completes the proof of the first statement .",
    "finally , the property ( [ eq : consistency ] ) of strong consistency of @xmath98 is obtained immediately upon setting @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "( 2007 , p.  2783 ) proposed a test for independence that is based on the sample distance correlation . from their results , we see that the asymptotic properties of the test statistic are not affected by the transition from the standard distance correlation to the affinely invariant distance correlation .",
    "hence , a completely analogous but different test can be stated in terms of the affinely invariant distance correlation . noting the results of kosorok ( 2009 , section 4 ) , we raise the possibility that the specific details can be devised in a judicious , data - dependent way so that the power of the test for independence increases when the transition is made to the affinely invariant distance correlation .",

    "rmillard ( 2009 ) proposed the use of the distance correlation to explore nonlinear dependencies in time series data .",
    "zhou ( 2012 ) pursued this approach recently and defined the auto distance covariance function and the auto distance correlation function , along with natural sample versions , for a strongly stationary vector - valued time series , say @xmath343 .",

    "positive lags indicate observations at goodnoe hills leading those at vansycle , or observations of the north - south component leading those of the east - west component , in units of hours . ]",
    "thus , we consider time series of bivariate wind vectors over @xmath351 consecutive @xmath352-minute intervals .",
    "we write @xmath348 and @xmath353 to denote the north - south and the east - west component of the wind vector at vansycle at time @xmath114 , with positive values corresponding to northerly and easterly winds .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath350 and @xmath354 for the north - south and the east - west component of the wind vector at goodnoe hills at time @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:4x4pcorplot ] shows the classical ( pearson ) sample auto and cross correlation functions for the four univariate time series .",
    "the auto correlation functions generally decay with the temporal , but do so non - monotonously , due to the presence of a diurnal component .",
    "the cross correlation functions between the wind vector components at vansycle and goodnoe hills show remarkable asymmetries and peak at positive lags , due to the prevailing westerly and southwesterly wind ( gneiting , et al .",
    "2006 ) . in another interesting feature ,",
    "the cross correlations between the north - south and east - west components at lag zero are strongly positive , documenting the dominance of southwesterly winds .",
    "figure [ fig:4x4dcorplot ] shows the sample auto and cross distance correlation functions for the four time series ; as these variables are univariate , there is no distinction between the standard and the affinely invariant version of the distance correlation .",
    "the patterns seen resemble those in the case of the pearson correlation . for comparison",
    ", we also display values of the distance correlation based on the sample pearson correlations shown in figure [ fig:4x4pcorplot ] , and converted to distance correlation under the assumption of bivariate gaussianity , using the results of szkely , et al .",
    "( 2007 , p.  2786 ) and section [ sec : aidc.mvn ] ; in every single case , these values are smaller than the original ones .     and @xmath355 at vansycle and goodnoe hills .",
    "for comparison , we also display , in grey , the values that are generated when the pearson correlation in figure [ fig:4x4pcorplot ] is converted to the affinely invariant distance correlation under the assumption of gaussianity ; these converted values generally are smaller than the original ones .",
    "positive lags indicate observations at goodnoe hills leading those at vansycle , in units of hours . ]",
    "having considered the univariate time series setting , it is natural and complementary to look at the wind vector time series @xmath356 at vansycle and @xmath357 at goodnoe hills from a genuinely multivariate perspective . to this end ,",
    "figure [ fig:2x2corplot ] shows the sample affinely invariant auto and cross distance correlation functions for the bivariate wind vector series at the two sites .",
    "again , a diurnal component is visible , and there is a remarkable asymmetry in the cross - correlation functions , which peak at lags of about two to three hours .",
    "in light of our analytical results in section [ sec : aidc.mvn ] , we can compute the affinely invariant distance correlation between subvectors of a multivariate normally distributed random vector .",
    "in particular , we can compute the affinely invariant auto and cross distance correlation between bivariate subvectors of a 4-variate gaussian process with pearson auto and cross correlations as shown in figure [ fig:4x4pcorplot ] . in figure [ fig:2x2corplot ] , values of the affinely invariant distance correlation that have been derived from pearson correlations in these ways",
    "are shown in grey ; the differences from those values that are computed directly from the data are substantial , with the converted values being smaller , possibly suggesting that assumptions of gaussianity may not be appropriate for this particular data set .",
    "we wish to emphasize that our study is purely exploratory : it is provided for illustrative purposes and to serve as a basic example . in future work , the approach hinted at here may have the potential to be developed into parametric bootstrap tests for gaussianity .",
    "following the pioneering work of zhou ( 2012 ) , the distance correlation may indeed find a wealth of applications in exploratory and inferential problems for time series data .",
    "in this paper , we have studied an affinely invariant version of the distance correlation measure introduced by szkely , et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and szkely and rizzo ( 2009 ) in both population and sample settings ( see szkely and rizzo ( 2012 ) for further aspects of the role of invariance in properties of distance correlation measures ) .",
    "the affinely invariant distance correlation shares the desirable properties of the standard version of the distance correlation and equals the latter in the univariate case . in the multivariate case ,",
    "the affinely invariant distance correlation remains unchanged under invertible affine transformations , unlike the standard version , which is preserved under orthogonal transformations only .",
    "furthermore , the affinely invariant distance correlation admits an exact and readily computable expression in the case of subvectors from a multivariate normal population .",
    "as we show in the appendix , the standard version allows for a series expansion , too , but this does not appear to be a series that generally can be made simple , and further research will be necessary to make it accessible to efficient numerical computation .    competing measures of dependence also have featured prominently recently ( reshef , et al .  2011 ; speed , 2011 ) .",
    "however , those measures are restricted to univariate settings , and claims of superior performance in exploratory data analysis have been disputed ( gorfine , heller and heller , 2012 ; simon and tibshirani , 2012 ) .",
    "we therefore opine with newton ( 2009 ) that the distance correlation and the affinely invariant distance correlation might become uniquely useful , and potentially the predominant , measures of dependence and associations for the 21st century .",
    "a potential drawback for large data sets is the computational cost required to compute the sample distance covariance , and the development of computationally efficient algorithms or subsampling techniques for doing this is highly desirable .",
    "in theorem [ th : aidcov ] and corollary [ cor : aidcov ] we calculated the affinely invariant distance covariance for multivariate normal populations . here , we consider the problem of deriving a formula for the standard distance covariance and distance correlation .",
    "we first consider the case in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 are scalar matrices , say , @xmath358 and @xmath359 with @xmath360 . thus , suppose that @xmath143 , where @xmath361 putting @xmath362 , we follow the proofs of theorem [ th : aidcov ] and corollary [ cor : aidcov ] to obtain @xmath363 \\\\   & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad     - 2 \\left [ { } _ 3f_2\\big(\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12,-\\tfrac12;\\tfrac12 p,\\tfrac12 q ;    \\lambda/4\\sigma_x^2\\sigma_y^2\\big ) - 1 \\right ] \\bigg).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we reduce the general case to the scalar case above . by making a diagonal transformation of the form ( [ eq : dcor.invariance ] )",
    "we see that we may assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are diagonal matrices",
    ". now denote by @xmath364 and @xmath365 the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "also , let @xmath366 and @xmath367 ; then , @xmath368 and @xmath369 . substituting these decompositions into the integral which defines @xmath370",
    ", we obtain @xmath371 next , we apply a taylor expansion , @xmath372 and , writing @xmath373 , we have @xmath374 similarly , on writing @xmath375 , we obtain @xmath376 integrating these series term - by - term , we find that the typical integral to be evaluated is @xmath377 by the substitution @xmath378 , we find that this integral vanishes if @xmath128 is odd , and so we need to calculate @xmath379 we transform to polar coordinates @xmath380 and @xmath381 , where @xmath175 , @xmath382 , and @xmath202 . then the integrals over @xmath180 and @xmath181 are standard gamma integrals : @xmath383 where @xmath384 and @xmath385 . as for the integrals over @xmath386 and @xmath387 , they are @xmath388 to evaluate these integrals , we expand @xmath389 using the multinomial theorem , obtaining a sum of terms , each of which is homogeneous in @xmath386 and @xmath387 .",
    "then we integrate term - by - term by transforming the surface measures @xmath184 and @xmath185 to euler angles ( anderson , 2003 , pp .",
    "285286 ) .",
    "the outcome is a multiple series expansion for the distance covariance .",
    "it does not appear to be a series that can be made simple in the general case , but it does provide an explicit expression in terms of @xmath104 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .    although we chose @xmath364 and @xmath365 to be the smallest eigenvalues of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , we could have chosen them to be any positive numbers .",
    "this is reminiscent of the comprehensive work of kotz , johnson , and boyd ( 1967a , 1967b ) on the distribution of positive definite quadratic forms in normal variables .",
    "bearing in mind those results , it seems likely that an optimal choice for @xmath364 and @xmath365 will be close to the arithmetic , geometric , or harmonic mean of the eigenvalues of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "at least , the issue of optimal choices for @xmath364 and @xmath365 that will accelerate the convergence of the above series is worthy of further investigation .",
    "finally , we note that our techniques allow for similar explicit expressions in the case of the @xmath390-distance dependence measures described by szkely , et al .",
