    "5 g cellular wireless systems are expected to support 1000 times faster data rates than the currently deployed 4 g long - term evolution ( lte ) system . to achieve the high data rates required by 5 g ,",
    "many technologies have been proposed @xcite . among them , massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems , which deploy unprecedented numbers of antennas at the base stations ( bss ) to simultaneously serve a relatively large number of user terminals ( uts ) , are believed to be one of the key candidate technologies for 5 g @xcite .",
    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a multi - carrier modulation technology suited for high data rate wideband wireless transmission @xcite . due to its robustness to channel frequency selectivity and relatively efficient implementation , ofdm combined with massive mimo is a promising technique for wideband massive mimo transmission @xcite .",
    "as in conventional mimo - ofdm , the performance of massive mimo - ofdm is highly dependant on the quality of the channel acquisition .",
    "pilot design and channel acquisition for massive mimo - ofdm is of great practical importance .",
    "optimal pilot design and channel acquisition for conventional mimo - ofdm has been extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "the most common approach is to estimate the channel response in the delay domain , and optimal pilots sent from different transmit antennas are typically assumed to satisfy the phase shift orthogonality condition in both the single - user case @xcite and the multi - user case @xcite .",
    "note that such phase shift orthogonal pilots ( psops ) have been adopted in lte @xcite .",
    "when channel spatial correlations are taken into account , optimal pilot design has been investigated for both the single - user case @xcite and multi - user case @xcite .",
    "although these orthogonal pilot approaches can eliminate pilot interference in the same cell , they do not take into account the pilot overhead issue , which is thought to be one of the limiting factors for throughput in massive mimo - ofdm [ 4 ] .",
    "when such approaches are directly adopted in time - division duplex ( tdd ) massive mimo - ofdm , the corresponding pilot overhead is proportional to the sum of the number of ut antennas , and would be prohibitively large as the number of uts becomes large .",
    "this becomes the system bottleneck , especially in high mobility scenarios where pilots must be transmitted more frequently .",
    "therefore , a pilot approach that takes the pilot overhead issue into account is of importance for massive mimo - ofdm systems .    in this paper",
    ", we propose adjustable phase shift pilots ( apsps ) for massive mimo - ofdm to reduce the pilot overhead .",
    "for apsps , one sequence along with different adjustable phase shifted versions of itself in the frequency domain are adopted as pilots for different uts .",
    "the proposed apsps are different from conventional psops @xcite , in which phase shifts for different pilots are fixed , and phase shift differences between different pilots are no less than the maximum channel delay ( divided by the system sampling duration ) of all the uts .",
    "since in our approach the phase shifts for different pilots are adjustable , more pilots are available compared with conventional psops , which leads to significantly reduced pilot overhead .",
    "the proposed apsps exploit the following two channel properties : first , wireless channels are sparse in many typical propagation scenarios ; most channel power is concentrated in a finite region of delays and/or angles due to limited scattering @xcite .",
    "such channel sparsity can be resolved in the angle domain in massive mimo due to the relatively large antenna array apertures , which has been observed in recent massive mimo channel measurement results @xcite .",
    "second , channel sparsity patterns , i.e. , channel power distributions in the angle - delay domain , for different uts are usually different . for apsps , when the phase shifts for pilots employed by different uts are properly scheduled according to the above channel properties , channel acquisition can be achieved simultaneously in an almost interference - free manner as with conventional psops",
    ". there has recently been increased research interest on utilizing channel sparsity for channel acquisition in massive mimo .",
    "for instance , a time - frequency training scheme @xcite and a distributed bayesian channel estimation scheme @xcite were proposed for massive mimo - ofdm by exploiting the channel sparsity . as the approaches in @xcite and @xcite focus on channel acquisition for a single ut",
    ", the corresponding pilot overhead would still grow linearly with the number of uts .",
    "channel sparsity has also been exploited to mitigate pilot contamination in multi - cell massive mimo @xcite .",
    "note that compressive sensing has been applied to sparse channel acquisition in some recent works ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , in which the corresponding pilot signals are usually assumed to be randomly generated .",
    "however , it is usually quite difficult to implement random pilot signals in practical systems @xcite .",
    "for example , adopting large dimensional random pilot signals in the massive mimo - ofdm systems considered here requires huge storage space and high complexity channel acquisition algorithms .",
    "in addition , a low peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) for randomly generated pilot signals usually can not be guaranteed .",
    "these drawbacks can be mitigated via proper design of the deterministic sensing matrices ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * based on a physically motivated channel model , we establish a relationship between the space - frequency domain channel covariance matrix ( sfccm ) and the channel power angle - delay spectrum for massive mimo - ofdm .",
    "we show that when the number of bs antennas is sufficiently large , the eigenvectors of the sfccms for different uts tend to be equal , while the eigenvalues depend on the respective channel power angle - delay spectra , which reveals the channel sparsity in the angle - delay domain .",
    "then we propose the angle - delay domain channel response matrix ( adcrm ) and the corresponding angle - delay domain channel power matrix ( adcpm ) , which can model the massive mimo - ofdm channel sparsity in the angle - delay domain , and are convenient for further analyses . * with the presented channel model",
    ", we propose apsp - based channel acquisition ( apsp - ca ) for massive mimo - ofdm in tdd mode . for apsps ,",
    "equivalent channels for different uts will experience corresponding cyclic shifts in the delay domain .",
    "using this property , we show that the sum mean square error ( mse ) of channel estimation ( mse - ce ) can be minimized if the uts channel power distributions in the angle - delay domain can be made non - overlapping with proper pilot phase shift scheduling . taking the time - varying nature of the channel into account",
    ", we further investigate channel prediction during the data segment using the received pilot signals .",
    "we show that the sum mse of channel prediction ( mse - cp ) can also be minimized if the uts channel power distributions in the angle - delay domain can be made non - overlapping with proper pilot phase shift scheduling , which coincides with the optimal channel estimation condition .",
    "a simplified pilot phase shift scheduling algorithm is developed based on this optimal channel acquisition condition .",
    "the proposed apsp - ca approach is investigated for cases involving both one symbol and multiple consecutive symbols . *",
    "the proposed apsp - ca is evaluated in several typical propagation scenarios , and significant performance gains in terms of achievable spectral efficiency over the conventional psop - based channel acquisition ( psop - ca ) are demonstrated , especially in high mobility scenarios .",
