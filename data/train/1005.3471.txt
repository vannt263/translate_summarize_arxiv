    "the creation and manipulation of ultracold polar molecules in their ground state is a growing endeavor in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "rubidium is the workhorse of ultracold atomic physics .",
    "it was the first atom to be bose condensed and it remains a favorite atom for simulations of correlated and many - body physics , and for forming cold molecules .",
    "the chromium atom has also been bose condensed and it is the only atomic species for which strong dipolar interaction has been observed @xcite .",
    "dipole moments , by virtue of their long - range @xmath6 interaction , where @xmath7 is the separation between atoms , can be tuned by external fields with increasing precision to control atomic interactions with applications to precision measurements , molecular physics and information processing .",
    "crrb is a heteronuclear molecule , and may therefore possess a sizable permanent electric dipole moment . in its ground electronic state , it has magnetic moment of five bohr magnetons ( @xmath8 ) , so it can be magnetically tuned . in its most abundant form ( 84% )",
    ", @xmath0cr has no nuclear spin , @xmath9 , but its fermionic isotope @xmath10cr ( 9.5% abundance ) has nuclear spin , @xmath11 , that couples to electronic spin , @xmath12 , to produce a number of hyperfine levels .",
    "therefore , bosonic - fermionic mixtures of crrb can be formed with large electric and magnetic dipole moments , with potentially interesting applications for degenerate dipolar fermi gases and spinor physics .",
    "there is no spectroscopic information available for the crrb molecule . a two - species magneto - optical trap ( mot ) for cr and rb was realized in 2004 @xcite , in which some @xmath13 @xmath0cr atoms and @xmath14 @xmath1rb atoms were loaded .",
    "cr is known to have large inelastic two - body spin - flip losses , so it can not be maintained in a mot @xcite .",
    "owing to its large magnetic moment , magnetic trapping ( mt ) of cr is possible @xcite , which allows the atoms to be trapped in its lowest high - field seeking state with total electronic spin @xmath12 and its projection @xmath15 . in the rb - mot + cr - mt configuration , hensler @xcite measured the two - body loss rate constant to be @xmath16 @xmath17/s and @xmath18 @xmath17/s , where the former refers to the loss due to the introduction of cr into the rb - loaded mot , and the latter refers to loading of the cr - mt first",
    ". the latter loss coefficient is about an order of magnitude larger than the former loss coefficient , because in the more shallow cr - mt , interspecies dipolar interactions lead more quickly to spin depolarizing collisions , hence depletion of the trap .    in this",

    "work , we analyze the electrostatic interaction of rb and cr atoms in their ground states , obtain born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential ground state energy curves , the long - range dispersion @xmath19 coefficient , and present a value for the electric dipole moment of the crrb molecule .",
    "we use the resulting potential energy curves to calculate the elastic and relaxation cross sections , hyperfine and dipolar fano - feshbach resonances which can be used to tune the interactions .",
    "the calculations of the bo potential energy curves and the permanent electric dipole moments were performed with the multiconfiguration complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf / caspt2 ) method @xcite .",
    "the basis set was of vqzp quality with the primitives obtained from the relativistic ano - rcc basis set ( @xmath20 for cr and @xmath21 for rb)@xcite .",
    "scalar relativistic effects are included in the calculations using the douglas - kroll - hess hamiltonian , as is standard in the molcas software .",
    "two active spaces were used .",
    "the first comprised the cr @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals and the rb @xmath24 , thus seven orbitals with seven active electrons . in the second set of calculations , a second set of @xmath22 orbitals",
    "was added to describe the @xmath22 double shell effect : 12 orbitals with seven electrons .",

    "these curves are well described by @xmath28 , where @xmath19 is the van der waals ( vdw ) coefficient .",

    "where the dynamic polarizability of each atom , @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33 the calculation of the dynamic polarizability requires knowledge of the oscillator strengths @xmath34 between the atomic ground state of energy @xmath35 and atomic excited states of energy @xmath36 .",
    "the summation is understood to also include integration over continuum .",
    "our calculated value of @xmath19 for the cr @xmath37 rb system , @xmath38 a.u . , which we believe to be accurate within 3% , is obtained from the highly - accurate values of the rb dynamic polarizability at imaginary frequencies @xcite and the recently accurate values for the cr dipole polarizability @xcite .",
