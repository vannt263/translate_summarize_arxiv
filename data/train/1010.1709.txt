    "interfaces that can be modeled by surfaces of constant mean curvature ( cmc ) are ubiquitous in nature and can now be synthesized in laboratory . recently ,",
    "urade et al .",
    "@xcite have reported fabrication of a nanoporous silica film whose structure is related to a specific cmc surface  the gyroid .",
    "the structure is three - dimensionally periodic and has three components : a thick surface and two channels , as detailed below .",
    "the interface between the wall and the channels approximates a double gyroid .",
    "urade et al .",
    "@xcite have also demonstrated a nanofabrication technique in which the channels are filled with a metal , while the silica wall can be either left in place or removed .",
    "these novel materials open a wide field of applications due to their topological and geometric features .",
    "the channels are a few nanometers thick and , when filled with a conducting or semiconducting material , are expected to acquire certain characteristics of one - dimensional quantum wires ( such as a blueshift of the spectrum and an enhanced density of states ) , while remaining three - dimensional in other respects @xcite .",
    "geometrically , the one  dimensional structure appears since each of the channels can be retracted to a skeletal graph @xcite , the gyroid graph .",
    "we will concentrate on the resulting geometry and topology of these networks in the possible presence of a constant magnetic field .",
    "topological quantities are of particular physical interest as they remain stable under continuous perturbations . in practice , those should be small as not to break the structure .",
    "we use two approaches : the first is purely classical and the second is the quantum / non  commutative approach due to alain connes @xcite .",
    "the classical results we provide are a study of the fundamental groups of the channel . here",
    "we determine the fundamental group of each channel system .",
    "this group is the commutator subgroup of the free group in three generators .",
    "a surprising result coming directly from the gyroid geometry is that there is a new length function on the free group which is different from the ordinary word length . with the help of this length function",
    "we determine the shortest loops at any given point .",
    "there are 15 such topologically distinct shortest loops ( 30 if one includes orientation ) .",
    "they split into two groups which are distinguished by their cyclic symmetry which is either of order two or three . in both groups",
    "there are three generators using this additional symmetry .",
    "these loops are of particular interest since numerical simulations @xcite show the possibility of an enhanced density states in a double - gyroid quantum wire , due to states that are nearly localized near such loops .",
    "we also calculate the flux of a constant magnetic field through these loops .",
    "the tool is an effective unit vector .",
    "the result of the calculation is that these effective unit vectors have a particularly simple form ( see table [ looptable ] ) .",
    "this fact should also be relevant for the study of the spin ",
    "orbit coupling of the loop  localized states .    our study of the non  commutative geometry is motivated by one of the big early successes of the noncommutative geometry of alain connes .",
    "this was the description by bellissard et al .",
    "of the quantum hall effect @xcite . this allowed to explain the integer effect in terms of the noncommutative geometric properties .",
    "the underlying geometry in that situation is the quantum 2-torus .",
    "recently there have been deeper analysis on the fractional effect using hyperbolic geometry as a model @xcite .",
    "the conceptual approach as outlined in @xcite is to replace the brioullin zone by a non  commutative brioullin zone which is given by a @xmath0algebra that contains the translational symmetry operators and the hamiltonian . in this geometry",
    "relevant quantities can often be expressed in terms of the @xmath1 theory of this algebra .",
    "this abelian group captures information related to the the topology or better the homotopy type of the algebra or geometric setup .",
    "these are again quantities which are stable under continuous deformations .",
    "a prime example is the hall conductance .",
    "a general fact which is pertinent to our discussion is that the @xmath1groups also serve to label the gaps in the spectrum .",
    "roughly this goes as follows .",
    "given a gap in the spectrum there is a projector projecting to the energy levels below the gap .",
    "this projector in turn gives rise to a @xmath1theory element .",
    "if one knows the ordered @xmath1theory then one can also sometimes deduce if only finitely or infinitely many gaps are possible .    in our situation , we determine the said @xmath0 algebra for one channel in the presence of a magnetic field and describe the @xmath1theories .",
    "the hamiltonian we use is the generalization @xcite of the harper hamiltonian @xcite adapted to our situation .",
    "we call the resulting algebra the bellissard  harper algebra and denote it by @xmath2 .",
    "this geometry is closely related to the non  commutative 3torus @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is a skew ",
    "symmetric @xmath5 matrix determined by the magnetic field .",
    "in fact we show that the algebra is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the @xmath6 matrix algebra with coefficient in the non  commutative 3torus . by varying the magnetic field ,",
    "we obtain a three ",
    "parameter family of algebras .",
    "we prove that at all but _",
    "finitely many _",
    "points this algebra is the full matrix algebra and hence morita equivalent to @xmath3 . since @xmath3 is simple at irrational @xmath4 one would expected this to be true on a dense set ( see  3 ) . we not only prove that this expectation at the irrational points , but are able to extend this result to almost all rational points . at certain special values of the field which we enumerate ,",
    "however , the algebra is genuinely smaller leading to a possibly different @xmath1theory . at these point",
    "the material may also exhibit special properties .",
    "the ordered @xmath1theory of the 3torus is completely known @xcite and actually completely classifies the isomorphism classes of such tori @xcite .",
    "our algebra always injects into a @xmath3 . from this and the knowledge of the ordered @xmath1group of the non  commutative torus",
    ", we obtain the result that there are only finitely many gaps possible at rational values of @xmath4 .",
    "our approach to both the classical and the quantum geometry uses graph theoretical methods .",
    "the relevant graphs are the gyroid graph which is a 3regular graph and its quotient under the translation symmetry group . in order to give the matrix algebras",
    "explicitly we introduce the notions of a graph representation . using rooted spanning trees , we are able to represent the algebra @xmath2 in terms of matrices , where they are amenable to direct computations .    as the geometry of the gyroid and its channels is quite difficult",
    ", we also treat the honeycomb lattice as a two  dimensional analogue .",
    "indeed , the gyroid lattice graph ( the graph onto which each channel retracts ) is in many ways the three dimensional analogue of the honeycomb lattice , which is why when developing the more general parts of the theory we will parallely consider these two cases as our main examples . both graphs are 3regular , and both of the graphs are not mathematical lattices but only physical lattices for the disambiguation of the use of the word `` lattice '' . ] .",
    "this means that they give rise to two groups , one which is the space or symmetry group and the other is the group of the lattice of which they can be considered a subset . in the honeycomb case",
    "these are both @xmath7 but embedded into @xmath8 as the triangular lattice and its dual . for the gyroid",
    "the groups are both @xmath9 , but they are embedded as a bcc and an fcc lattice in @xmath10 which are again dual to each other .",
    "furthermore the fundamental group of the honeycomb lattice is the commutator subgroup of the free group on two elements , while for the gyroid @xmath11 is the commutator subgroup of the free group in three generators . and in both cases , we find a new length function on the free group induced by the geometry of the lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in the first section , we start with a review of the classical geometry of the gyroid and then prove the results on the fundamental group and the smallest loops . in the second section ,",
    "we formally introduce graphs and lattices and the relevant groups associated to them .",
    "we then define their representation in hilbert spaces and the associated harper operators .",
    "finally , we show how to obtain a matrix representation of @xmath2 using rooted spanning trees . in the third section , we apply the general theory of the second section to the non  commutative geometry of a lattice using a harper operator , detailing the honeycomb and the gyroid case . here",
    "we also briefly review projective representations and explain how they arise in the presence of a magnetic field . in this context",
    ", we can already show that there can only be finitely many gaps for the gyroid at rational @xmath4 .",
    "we also outline the general approach to calculating @xmath2 and its @xmath1theory and the expected results .",
    "in particular , we compute the @xmath1theory in the commutative case in terms of a cover of a torus .    in the last section",
    "we apply the outlined strategies to calculate the algebras @xmath2 and their @xmath1theory for bravais lattices , the honeycomb lattice and the gyroid lattice graph .",
    "the gyroid is an embedded cmc surface in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it was discovered by alan schoen @xcite as an interface for block polymers .",
    "the interface actually consists of _ two _ disconnected surfaces . _",
    "each _ of them is a gyroid surface .",
    "the double gyroid ( dg ) is a particular configuration of two mutually non  intersecting embedded gyroids .",
    "a single gyroid has symmetry group @xmath12 while the double gyroid has the symmetry group @xmath13 where the extra symmetry comes from interchanging the two gyroids .",
    "since cmc surfaces are mathematically hard to handle level surfaces have been suggested as a possible approximation in @xcite .",
    "the levelsurface approximation for the double gyroid again consists of two level surfaces .",
    "we will call the two surface interfaces @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for the discussion at hand it is not relevant if the two surfaces are actually the cmc surfaces or their level surface approximations .",
    "one example of a dg approximation is given by the family of level surfaces    @xmath16    a model for the double gyroid is then given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the complement @xmath20 of a single gyroid @xmath21 has two components .",
    "these components will be called the gyroid wire systems or channels .",
    "there are two distinct channels , one left and one right handed .",
    "each of these channels contracts onto a graph , called skeletal graph in @xcite .",
    "we will call these graphs @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "each graph is periodic and trivalent .",
    "we fix @xmath22 to be the graph which has the node @xmath24 . we will give more details on the graph @xmath22 below .",
    "the channel containing @xmath22 is contained in figure [ bigcellfig ] .",
    "a ( crystal ) unit cell of the channel together with the embedded graph @xmath25 is shown in figure [ gyrlabelsfig ] and just the graph is contained in figure [ gammalabelsfig ] .",
    "the channel @xmath26     the graph @xmath22 embedded into its channel @xmath26     the graph @xmath22 ]    in constructing the surface , one can actually start with one of these graphs and evolve the surface from it @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of one skeletal graph is that of a single gyroid @xmath12 .    to obtain the double gyroid one can evolve from both the graphs .",
    "the common symmetry group of both of these graphs is @xmath13 .",
    "this symmetry group can actually be defined already on the nodes @xmath28 of the two graphs @xmath29 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath12 is then determined to be the subgroup that fixes both sets of nodes ( setwise ) .",
    "in the case of the double gyroid @xmath30 , the complement @xmath31 of the disjoint union of the two gyroid surfaces has three connected components .",
    "these are two channel systems @xmath32 and @xmath33 , each of which can be retracted to its skeletal graph @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , the skeletal graph is a deformation retract @xcite .",
    "there is a third connected component @xmath35 and we will call @xmath36 .",
    "this is a 3-manifold with two boundary components , more precisely , @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath35 can be thought of as a `` thickened '' ( fat ) surface .",
    "the thickness is fixed by the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath35 can be retracted to each of the two boundary surfaces @xmath39 .",
    "in fact there is a deformation retract of @xmath35 onto the gyroid .",
    "this means that all homotopical information about the complements of the double gyroid is encoded in the gyroid / level surface and the two skeletal graphs .",
    "the translational symmetry group for both the gyroid and the double gyroid is the bravais lattice bcc .",
    "note that we will usually use `` lattice '' in the physical terminology , e.g.speak about the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the term `` bravais lattice '' will be used to denote a maximal rank mathematical lattice , i.e.  an free rank @xmath40 abelian subgroup of @xmath41 . in order to preempt any confusion ,",
    "we give precise definitions for our terminology in  [ latdefsec ] .",
    "we will now describe the graph @xmath22 embedded into @xmath10 .",
    "set @xmath42 and let @xmath43 .    furthermore @xmath9 acts on @xmath10 by translations and we let @xmath44 be the image of the set @xmath45 under this action .",
    "we will sometimes call this set of points the gyroid lattice .    given",
    "two points @xmath46 let @xmath47\\}$ ] be the line segment joining them .",
    "also given a point @xmath48 we let @xmath49 be the translated points .    consider the following set of line segments    @xmath50    let @xmath51 , where again @xmath52 acts as a subgroup of the translation group .",
    "the graph @xmath22 is the graph whose vertices are @xmath53 , whose",
    "edges are @xmath54 with the obvious incidence relations .",
    "we recall :    @xcite @xmath32 can be deformation retracted onto the graph @xmath22 and @xmath22 is the component of the critical graph contained in @xmath32 .",
    "the homotopy type of the complement @xmath55 is the same as that of two copies of @xmath22 .",
    "in particular each channel has the same homotopy type as @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that all topological invariants @xmath56 which are homotopy invariant are isomorphic to those of @xmath57 .",
    "this means all homology , homotopy and k - groups of the topological space @xmath32 or @xmath33 are determined on @xmath22 .      quotienting out by either the standard translation group or the bcc lattice , we obtain the following two quotient graphs .",
    "let @xmath58 be the graph @xmath59 thought of as an abstract graph .",
    "this graph has a natural map embedding into the 3-torus @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath58 is a cube embedded into the 3-torus .",
    "more precisely the vertices of @xmath61 are @xmath62 and the edges are the images of @xmath63 in @xmath60 .    the abstract graph is given in figure [ qubefig ] which also contains the images of the vectors @xmath64 which name and orient all edges .     the graph @xmath58 for the gyroid , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    since all the vertices in the fundamental domain do not lie on the boundary , they give exactly the representatives of @xmath65 in @xmath60 .",
    "the classes of the edges @xmath66 are given exactly by the images of the set @xmath63 in @xmath60 .      by modding out by @xmath9 ,",
    "we have not yet used the full translational symmetry of @xmath25 which is the bcc lattice .",
    "a set of generators for the bcc lattice is @xmath67 another set of generators which is more symmetric and we will use later on is : @xmath68    we let @xmath69 be the free abelian subgroup of @xmath10 by these vectors .",
    "we define @xmath61 to be the abstract quotient graph @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath61 is the graph with 4 vertices and 6 edges , where all pairs of distinct vertices are connected by exactly one edge .",
    "this graph is sometimes also called the complete square .",
    "its incidence matrix has entries one everywhere except on the diagonal , where the entries are zero .",
    "this graph is shown in figure [ square ] .",
    "the complete square , the rooted spanning tree @xmath71 ( root @xmath72 and edges @xmath73 ) and the vectors corresponding to the oriented edges , the collapsed tree @xmath74    we see that there is an embedding of @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the bcc lattice , so that we only have to divide @xmath77 by the additional symmetry generated by @xmath78 .",
    "now mod @xmath9 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 simply interchanges the vertices of @xmath58 as follows : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "hence we are left with 4 vertices , and we can choose the representatives @xmath83 .",
    "checking the list of edges ( [ edgelist ] ) one sees that indeed the 12 edges form pairs and one can choose the representatives @xmath84 .",
    "notice that this corresponds to a @xmath85 symmetry of the graph @xmath58 .",
    "it is given by mapping each vertex to its diagonally opposite vertex and maps the edges accordingly .",
    "there is another bravais lattice hidden in the geometry of the gyroid .",
    "this is the fcc lattice .",
    "the nearest neighbour positions differ by vectors generating an fcc lattice .",
    "this means in particular that after shifting by @xmath86 the _ positions _ of the vertices of @xmath25 all lie on an fcc lattice .    in order to fix notation set : @xmath87    let @xmath69 be the group of @xmath10 that is generated by @xmath88    the group @xmath69 is isomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "the bravais lattice it generates is a face centered cubic ( fcc ) .",
    "there are relations among the @xmath64 given as follows .",
    "@xmath89 so that we see that @xmath90 generate . these vectors are linearly independent over @xmath91 since they are independent over @xmath92 . hence they provide a free basis and an isomorphism to @xmath9 . the vectors @xmath93 are the standard primitive vectors for the face centered cubic .",
    "of course there are many other choices of basis here , e.g.@xmath94 .",
    "[ fccprop ] the vertices of @xmath95 , lie on the 3-dimensional face centered cubic lattice @xmath21 generated by @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 is path connected and we take @xmath98 as the base point .",
    "each line segments in @xmath63 corresponds to an edge .",
    "choosing an orientation for this edge defines a vector .",
    "now , the statement follows from the fact that the vectors corresponding to the line segments in @xmath63 and hence those of @xmath99 are exactly the vectors @xmath100 .",
    "there is certain geometric information which can even already be read off from the simple graph @xmath101 . such as its fundamental group or the minimal loops starting at a given vertex .",
    "a loop on @xmath25 is minimal if it passes through a minimal number of edges .",
    "a more general treatment will be given in ",
    "[ latticesec ] .",
    "let @xmath102 be the free group in three variables .",
    "the ( realization ) of the graphs @xmath25 and @xmath101 have following fundamental groups :    1 .",
    "@xmath103 $ ] 2 .",
    "@xmath104    in particular @xmath25 is the maximal abelian cover of @xmath101 .    since @xmath25 is homotopic to one channel",
    "these results hold for each channel of the gyroid .",
    "we start with @xmath101 .",
    "this graph is homotopic to the wedge product of three @xmath105 s , whence the second claim follows .    in view of lemma [ looplem ] below ( more generally by proposition [ fundprop ] ) , we see that @xmath106 is the subgroup that is the kernel of the map @xmath102 to its abelianization .",
    "indeed the sum of powers of each of the generators in a word in the group has to be zero , which precisely means that such a word is in the kernel of the abelianization map or in other words , the commutator group .",
    "[ looplem ] a loop on the graph @xmath101 lifts to a loop on @xmath25 if and only if each edge is traversed the same number of times in each direction .",
    "the `` if '' direction is clear since this means that the translations have to add up to zero .",
    "the equivalence follows from the general proposition [ fundprop ] , by noticing that indeed the lifts @xmath107 give rise to the vectors @xmath108 of ( [ bccveceq2 ] ) and are linearly independent .",
    "there are closed loops in the graph @xmath25 .",
    "each minimal loop goes through 10 sites and at each point there are 30 such loops or 15 undirected loops .    a path in which one goes back and forth through an edge is homotopic to the path in which this step is omitted . by direct calculation",
    "one can see that such a path is given by traversing any five of the six edges . at the first step one has @xmath109 choices of edges , at the second step there are two and then again two possibilities . here",
    "one either returns to the original vertex or not .",
    "in the first case there are 2 completions and in the second case 3 completions to a minimal loop .",
    "thus we have @xmath110 possibilities . a detailed version of this enumeration is provided at the end of this section in  [ loopcalcsec ] .",
    "here we give the details of the calculation of the loops . using proposition [ fundprop ] , we have to look for paths that traverse each edge the same number of times .",
    "we first look at the cases where each edge is traversed only once in each direction .",
    "we call such a path a good path",
    ". we also have to keep the number of these edges minimal .",
    "this already puts a simple constraint on the path .",
    "we may not go back and forth through the same edge .",
    "starting at the given vertex we have to pass through 2 distinct edges .",
    "after this we have a choice , we can either go back to the starting vertex ( case i ) or we can go to the only vertex which we have not reached yet ( case ii ) . in case i the next oriented edge is fixed , but then we have two choices ia and ib .",
    "after this we have already used 5 edges so that the minimal possible number of oriented edges and hence the length of the loop is 10 .",
    "indeed , we can can complete the edge path uniquely to a good path without traversing the 6th edge .",
    "in case ii the fifth oriented edge for a good path is fixed , going opposite the first oriented edge .",
    "there is a choice for the sixth oriented edge in the path . either returning to @xmath111 ( iib ) or not ( iia ) .",
    "the case iib has a unique choice for a fifths oriented edge for a good path and this has a unique completion to a good path involving 5 edges , again giving a length of 10 loops . in case iia",
    ", we again have two choices for the fifth oriented edge ( iia1 ) and ( iia2 ) . both these choices have a unique completions to good paths again of length 10 .",
    "it remains to treat the cases where an edge is traversed more that once in each direction . since we are not allowed to go back and forth on one edge the choices for the first three oriented edges are as above .",
    "now in case i we could go along the first oriented edge again , but this would lead us to traverse at least 6 edges and hence would not be minimal . at the next step of case i the choices are precisely ia or ib and traversing an edge twice in the same direction would not be minimal . for case",
    "ii , the first stage where one could use an oriented edge twice for iia is the fifth edge .",
    "but then one would need at least 6 edges counting multiplicities .",
    "after fixing the fifth oriented edge one can only increase the number of traversed oriented edges by not choosing a good path . finally in case iib again the first edge with a choice to traverse an edge twice in one orientation is at the fifth oriented edge , but as before this would lead to a path of length greater than 10 .",
    "so all in all we have @xmath112 choices for the first two edges and then once these are fixed 5 choices for a good path .",
    "this means in all there are 30 such oriented paths .      on the graph @xmath101",
    "there is a symmetry group of order 6 preserving the base point and the spanning tree @xmath71 which permutes the vertices b , c and d. this is precisely the group that gives us the 6 first choices .    in order to write down a shorter list",
    ", we will make the following observations .",
    "since the inverse of a minimal path is a minimal path , we can cut down the number to 15 .",
    "now since each of the paths traverses five edges , it misses one .",
    "there are two cases : ( 1 ) the edge that is missed is incident to @xmath86 , i.e.  @xmath113 or @xmath114 and case ( 2 ) it is not , i.e.  @xmath115 .",
    "case ( 1 ) corresponds to iia1 and iia2 , which case ( 2 ) corresponds to ia , ib and iib . in the case",
    "( 1 ) the vertex @xmath86 is traversed 1 additional time except at the start and end of the path and in case ( 2 ) it is traversed an additional 2 times .",
    "this decomposes the loops into two pieces of length 5 in case ( 1 ) or three pieces of length 3,3,4 ; 3,4,3 ; 4,3,3 in case ( 2 ) for ia , ib , iib respectively . with each loop ,",
    "its cyclic permutation of these components is also a loop .",
    "there are 2 such loops in case ( 1 ) and 3 such loops in case ( 2 ) .",
    "this also explains the 15 loops as @xmath116 and permutes the cases iia1 , iia2 ; and ia , iib and ib cyclically .     the combinatorial cases for the minimal loops of the gyroid ]    we give here a list of six basic loops which may be useful for further discussion . to obtain all 30 one should cyclically permute the blocks and take full inverses of the loops",
    "we give the loops as an edge path as well as their decomposition into the basis loops @xmath117 .",
    ".[looptable]a generating set the shortest loops and their effective normal vectors [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to note that the explicit isomorphism @xmath118 given on the generators @xmath119 of @xmath102 by @xmath120 induces a new length on @xmath102 as the minimal length in the letters @xmath64 .",
    "it is this length that remembers the structure of the gyroid .",
    "the computation above is a good example of this .",
    "the three examples of commutators are minimal elements of @xmath121 $ ] which are not the identity in the length in @xmath119 or @xmath122 .",
    "they are of length 4 . in the @xmath64",
    "their length is 10 .",
    "the other examples are of length 6 in the @xmath119 , so not minimal in this metric , but they are minimal in the @xmath64 being of length 10 .",
    "one distinguishing feature of the different loops is their spatial orientation .",
    "this for instance has an effect on the flux through a surface bounded by such a loop .",
    "we assume a constant magnetic field . in this case",
    "if @xmath123 is a surface bounding a loop @xmath124 , let @xmath125 . then by stokes",
    ", we can just integrate over the surface given by the union of the triangles defined by @xmath126 . if @xmath127 and @xmath128 then we have for the magnetic flux through @xmath123 @xmath129    the values for @xmath130 are listed for the basic loops .",
    "notice that inversion of a loop inverts the normal vector , while the cyclic permutation of the components leaves the effective normal vector invariant .      in order to promote the skeletal graph to a quantum graph",
    ", we will fix a hilbert space and a hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we will use the generalized harper hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the original harper hamiltonian @xcite is obtained for a cubic lattice by using the tight - binding approximation and peierls substitution for the quasimomentum @xcite .    in the next section",

    "for the gyroid the notions such as graphs and groups have been introduced above , so that the reader may substitute these in the general definitions below .",

    "so assume @xmath694 .",
    "in this case the story is similar , but faster .",
    "we keep @xmath695 as above .",
    "then if @xmath696 we set @xmath697 and again obtain the full matrix algebra using @xmath698 to obtain the needed elementary matrices .",
    "if @xmath699 then since @xmath700 we have @xmath701 and hence @xmath702 and so @xmath703 since else @xmath704 and @xmath705 .",
    "thus we get that @xmath706 with the factor being invertible . and",
    "again , we are done .    if @xmath707 and not all @xmath708 then the bh ",
    "algebra @xmath2 is equal to the full matrix algebra @xmath709 .    as before this follows from an explicit representation of the generators @xmath710 as expressions in @xmath2 .",
    "since not all @xmath711 there must be some @xmath712 .",

    "either @xmath714 or not .",
    "in the second case , we set @xmath715 and @xmath716.we set @xmath717 , and @xmath718 .",

    ", we must have @xmath681 because otherwise @xmath722 would also be @xmath723 . in this case , we proceed analogously to obtain @xmath688 . in both subcases",
    "we obtain the full matrix algebra following the strategy used in the previous proof",
    ".    finally , we deal with the case that @xmath724 :    if @xmath725 then @xmath726 then it follows that @xmath727 and we are done by an analogous calculation . indeed if @xmath728 then also @xmath729 and all @xmath119 are real which we excluded .    if @xmath730 then @xmath731 and it follows that @xmath727 and we are done by an analogous calculation .",
    "indeed if @xmath731 then @xmath728 again means that all three @xmath119 are real which was excluded .",
    "[ phitwoprop ] if @xmath707 and all of the @xmath711 then the bh  algebra @xmath2 is a proper subalgebra of the full matrix algebra @xmath732 .",
    "we will show this using the character @xmath733 , defined by @xmath734 .",
    "this character induces an algebra morphism @xmath735 and we will show that @xmath736 which implies the result .",
    "we note that @xmath737    since @xmath738 all the @xmath739 must be fourth roots of unity and furthermore @xmath740 .",
    "there are again three cases .",
    "the first is that all @xmath741 . in this case @xmath742 .",
    "therefore @xmath743 . now @xmath744 and so @xmath745",
    "so that @xmath746 is the 2 dimensional subalgebra of @xmath747 spanned by @xmath748 and @xmath35 .",
    "the second case is that all @xmath749 and only one @xmath741 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath750 .",
    "the rest of the cases are symmetric .    in this case",

    "then as @xmath753 , so that @xmath754 . on the other hand @xmath755 and @xmath756 . and hence all the @xmath757 .",
    "these are the @xmath548 block matrices making up @xmath436 .",
    "but the span of these matrices is precisely @xmath572 .",
    "the final case is exactly one @xmath749 .",
    "we will treat the case @xmath758 .",
    "the rest are again symmetric . in this case",
    "@xmath2 is the 10dimensional matrix algebra of matrices of the form    @xmath759    let @xmath760 be the subalgebra above . again it is an exercise to check that @xmath760 is indeed a subalgebra . in the current case : @xmath761 and hence it follows that @xmath762 .",
