    "a classification problem is defined by two ingredients , a set of objects and an equivalence relation on it .",
    "the problem is solved if one knows a complete list of equivalence classes and can tell which equivalence class each object represents .",
    "a natural approach is of course to find _ invariants _ assigned for each equivalence class and a method to compute them given a representative of the equivalence class .",
    "the classification is completed when a complete set of invariants is found such that distinct equivalence classes have distinct sets of invariants .    for gapped hamiltonians ,",
    "the equivalence relation is given by continuous paths in a space of gapped local hamiltonians .",
    "an equivalence class is a quantum phase of matter . the quasi - adiabatic evolution  @xcite gives us a new insight to this problem .",
    "a gapped path of hamiltonians defines a unitary transformation @xmath0 that is generated by a sum of ( quasi-)local operators and relates the ground state subspace on one end of the path to that on the other end . because of the locality of the generator of @xmath0 , it is well approximated by a product of layers of non - overlapping local unitary transformations , called a local quantum circuit , where the number of layers or the depth of the quantum circuit is much smaller than the system size .",
    "conversely , a small - depth local quantum circuit defines a piece - wise smooth path in the gapped local hamiltonian space , as any local unitary operator can be written as the exponential of a local operator .",
    "thus , a gapped hamiltonian path and a quantum circuit are intuitively equivalent , though proving it may involve very nontrivial approximation analyses depending on purposes .",
    "we will discuss only the quantum circuits in this paper for their simplicity .",
    "the intuitive correspondence between a gapped hamiltonian path and a small - depth quantum circuit suggests that all information about the quantum phase of matter is contained in the ground state wave function , since the equivalence relation by quantum circuits can be tested for given wave functions .",
    "indeed , for two - dimensional topologically ordered systems it has been proposed that the total quantum dimension  @xcite and the topological s - matrix  @xcite can be computed from the ground state wave functions . the total quantum dimension @xmath1 is shown to be equal to the exponential of the universal constant correction , called the topological entanglement entropy , to the area law of entanglement entropy .",
    "namely , if @xmath2 is a contractible disk of circumference @xmath3 , which is much larger than the correlation length , then the entanglement entropy of the ground state for @xmath2 obeys @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a model - dependent constant .",
    "thus it can be computed from a single wave function .",
    "the reason that the entanglement entropy gets negative correction may be intuitively understood in the string condensate picture  @xcite as the requirement that strings be closed should reduce the entropy .",
    "it has been argued that the total quantum dimension is the only information one can extract from entanglement entropies of a single wave function  @xcite .",
    "even so , it was shown that from the full set of ground states on a torus one can extract the topological s - matrix  @xcite , which is a finer quantity of the phase of matter than the total quantum dimension .",
    "based on these ideas , numerical computation was performed  @xcite , measuring the topological entanglement entropy , to give an evidence that a highly frustrated magnetic system exhibits topological order .    the argument for the robustness or the invariance of these quantities , however , is indirect .",
    "the argument of kitaev and preskill  @xcite that there exists a universal constant correction is invalid unless one assumes some homogeneity because of the bravyi s",
    "counterexample  .",
    "bravyi pointed out that the so - called one - dimensional cluster state , if cleverly embedded into the plane , gives a nonzero contribution to the topological entanglement entropy , although the cluster state can be created from a product state by a quantum circuit of depth two .",
    "kim  @xcite obtains a bound on the first order perturbation of the topological entanglement entropy , assuming certain homogeneity and an extra criterion on conditional mutual information for various regions .",
    "the topological s - matrix of zhang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite seems robust , but it relies on an assumption that the system is described by a modular tensor category . on the mathematics side , there is ocneanu s rigidity theorem proving that any modular tensor category can not be deformed except for trivial basis changes  @xcite ( see also appendix  e.6 of @xcite ) , but it is nontrivial when and how a two - dimensional hamiltonian corresponds to a modular tensor category .",
    "our understanding of invariants is reflected in the status of the following problem . if two wave functions are ground states of distinct phases of matter , how deep a local quantum circuit must be in order to transform one wave function to another ?",
    "this question has been addressed and partially solved by bravyi , hastings , and verstraete  @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "they showed that if there are two or more degenerate ground states that are locally indistinguishable , then this local indistinguishability is an invariant .",
    "however , the local indistinguishability can only tell trivial product states from topological states . also , this is applicable , tautologically , when there are two or more states .",
    "a topological model can be defined on a sphere , in which case the local indistinguishability is of no use since there is a unique ground state .",
    "knig and pastawski  @xcite have realized this limitation .",
    "here , we show that for topologically ordered systems one can define a matrix @xmath6 , and that it is an invariant of the state under local unitary transformations .",
    "the systems we consider are restricted to those with unfrustrated commuting projector hamiltonians satisfying certain natural conditions which are elaborated later .",
    "we argue that this matrix must match the topological s - matrix if the system is described by a modular tensor category .",
    "the invariance proof directly implies that any transformation quantum circuit between states with distinct @xmath6 matrices has depth that is at least linear in the system s diameter .",
    "although our argument is certainly motivated by the modular tensor category description , our treatment is independent from it .",
    "rather , our result should be read as a justification of the modular category description for certain lattice systems .",
    "in addition , our treatment solely requires a large disk - like region , and does not depend on the boundary conditions .",
    "this might shed some light on how to compute a finer invariant , the s matrix , given a single wave function .",
    "this is potentially important in numerics for identifying a quantum phase of matter in 2d because the density matrix renormalization group method is systematically biased to select a particular ground state even if there is degeneracy  @xcite , which might prohibit obtaining the full ground state subspace .",
    "we assume that the system is governed by an unfrustrated local commuting projector hamiltonian with two extra conditions .",
    "the first one is the local topological order condition , which is natural for any anyon models  @xcite .",
    "this condition asserts that the local reduced density matrix on a region @xmath7 of a ground state wave function is inferred from the terms of the hamiltonian around @xmath7 .",
    "the second one is a new condition , which we call _ stable logical algebra condition _ , asserting that the algebra of all string operators on an annulus is independent of the thickness of the annulus .",
    "a motivation for this condition is that the interaction among anyons is determined by the topology of the paths they have moved along .",
    "it seems that the second condition closely related to the finiteness of the number of topological particle types in two dimensions ; we show that this condition fails to be true when there are infinite number of particle types .",
    "the @xmath6 is defined by particle type projection operators @xmath8 supported on two annuli of comparable size as shown in figure  [ fig : annuli ] . here , @xmath8 projects onto a state where a definite particle is present in the inner disk of the annulus .",
    "@xmath9-entry of @xmath6 is the expectation value of the _ linking _ of @xmath8 on the left annulus and @xmath10 on the right annulus .",
    "this is almost identical to the usual definition of the topological s - matrix .",
    "the difference is that we use the particle type projection operators instead of string operators that carry particles of definite types .",
    "our approach is advantageous because we can avoid any difficulty in defining the string operators associated with definite particle types .",
    "our @xmath11 matrix is independent of hamiltonians in the sense that whenever @xmath12 is a common ground state of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where each of @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfies our two conditions , the result @xmath6 is the same .",
    "central to the proof of this is a notion of _ locally invisible _ operators .",
    "they are invisible since there is no way to tell whether the operator has acted on , by looking at a small region .",
    "this is an abstraction of the string operators that transport anyons .",
    "it is important that the locally invisible operators are defined without any reference to a hamiltonian .",
    "it turns out that the existence of the locally invisible operators is a signature of topological order or `` long - range '' entanglement .",
    "that is , the locally invisible operators are _ many - body entanglement witnesses . _",
    "the locally invisible operators need not wrap around a topologically nontrivial loop ; they can distinguish a topologically ordered state from a product state even though they are supported on a large but finite disk .",
    "section  [ sec : locally - invisible ] where we study locally invisible operators can be read independent of the rest of this paper .",
    "the main text is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : s - matrix ] we define the particle type projector operators @xmath8 and the matrix @xmath6 for a hamiltonian @xmath15 , and argue that having @xmath6 is equivalent to having the topological s - matrix .",
    "we will compute @xmath6 for the simplest model , the toric code  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : locally - invisible ] is devoted to the definition and properties of locally invisible operators",
    ". an unanswered question of ref .",
    "@xcite will be answered , on how deep a quantum circuit must be in order to create a toric code state on a sphere .",
    "the last section  [ sec : invariant ] contains our main theorem .",
    "we remark that for abelian discrete gauge theories @xmath6 is a complete invariant .",
    "the section is divided into several subsections to clarify and explain our technical conditions .",
    "we consider lattices where finite dimensional degrees of freedom ( qudits ) are placed at each site .",
    "we say an operator @xmath16 is * supported * on a region @xmath17 if @xmath16 acts by identity on the complement of @xmath17 .",
    "the * support * of @xmath16 is the minimal region @xmath17 on which @xmath16 is supported .",
    "the * subspace support * of a hermitian operator @xmath18 is the linear space spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath18 with nonzero eigenvalues .",
    "( the projection onto the subspace support of the density operator @xmath18 is also known as _ support projection _ in operator algebra . ) an * annulus * is the bounded region between two concentric circles on a plane .",
    "we say the annulus is of radius @xmath19 and thickness @xmath20 if the radius of the inner circle is @xmath21 , and the outer @xmath22 .",
    "a * ( local ) quantum circuit * is an ordered product of layers of local unitary operators of non - overlapping support .",
    "every local unitary operator in a layer acts on at most two qudits that are nearest neighbors of each other .",
    "the * depth * of a quantum circuit is the number of layers in it .",
    "the * range * of the quantum circuit @xmath23 is the minimum distance @xmath24 such that for every operator @xmath16 supported on a disk of radius @xmath25 the conjugated operator @xmath26 is supported on a disk of radius @xmath27 for any @xmath25 . since local unitary operator in a quantum circuit acts on a pair of qudits separated by distance @xmath28 , the range of the quantum circuit is always less than or equal to its depth .",
    "the * interaction range * of a local hamiltonian is the distance @xmath29 such that any term in the hamiltonian is supported on a disk of diameter @xmath29 .",
    "the topological s - matrix @xmath30 contains information on the mutual braiding interaction between far separated excitations .",
    "the rows and columns of @xmath30 are indexed by types of excitations and @xmath9 entry is the quantum mechanical amplitude of the process , where a particle - anti - particle pair of type @xmath31 and another pair of type @xmath32 are created and separated , the particle @xmath31 is moved around the particle @xmath32 ( braiding ) , and then the particle - anti - particle pairs are annihilated . if the braiding is sufficiently nontrivial , then @xmath30 with a proper normalization is a unitary matrix .",
    "@xcite    this explanation contains essential physical intuition of the s - matrix , but this , as it is stated , can not be a definition since we do not specify how particle types are defined .",
    "the particle types must be a quantum number ( conserved quantity ) that is invariant under certain local operators .",
    "the class of allowed local operators that preserve the quantum number is usually determined by the symmetry of the system . for example , the total angular momentum is invariant under the action of rotation symmetry on the physical state of a particle , and hence is one of defining quantum numbers of the particle type , the spin .",
    "however , in topological systems , which is of interest in our discussion , there is no symmetry restriction .",
    "a conservation law in this unrestricted situation is termed as a superselection rule  @xcite , and the particle types are identified with the superselection sector that the particle represents  @xcite .      to be concrete ,",
    "let us restrict our discussion to two - dimensional lattices with finite dimensional degrees of freedom placed at each site , and hilbert space is given by the tensor product of the local degrees of freedom .",
    "consider a local hamiltonian @xmath33 and localized excitation @xmath34 that is separated from the rest excitations by a large distance .",
    "we assume that every term of @xmath15 is a projector commuting with any other term @xmath35 = 0 $ ] , and on the ground state @xmath12 every term of @xmath15 is minimized @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath15 is not frustrated .",
    "the state @xmath37 in which the excitation @xmath34 is separated from the rest can be described by the condition @xmath38 whenever @xmath39 is supported on an annulus @xmath2 circling around @xmath34 .",
    "what operators should we consider in order to learn about the superselection sector that @xmath34 represents ?",
    "certainly , we should consider any operators acting on the inner disk @xmath17 of the annulus .",
    "they form a matrix algebra @xmath40 these operators will create and annihilate excitations on the inner disk , but will not change the fact that excitations outside the annulus are far separated from those on the inner disk .",
    "in addition , we should consider aharanov - bohm interference measurements about @xmath34 , by letting various particles encircle @xmath34 along the annulus .",
    "the operators of this class are supported on the annulus and commute with terms of the hamiltonian since the overall effect of the measurement should not introduce any new excitation .",
    "so they belong to an algebra @xmath41 = 0 \\text { for all $ h_j$ } \\}.\\ ] ] since @xmath42 are hermitian , @xmath43 is in fact a @xmath44-algebra .",
    "the elements of @xmath43 do not act faithfully on the state @xmath37 , because it is defined regardlessly of eq .  .",
    "for instance ,",
    "@xmath45 with @xmath39 supported on the annulus is an element of @xmath43 , but acts on @xmath37 as zero ; any two operators of @xmath43 that differ by a _ null _ operator",
    "@xmath46 should have the same result on @xmath37 . in view of the interference thought - experiment",
    ", the null operator corresponds to flux measurement along a small loop that is entirely contained in the annulus , followed by the postselection onto a nonzero flux value . since the vacuum condition eq .",
    "ensures that the flux is zero along such small loops , this outcome has necessarily zero probability .",
    "thus , it is appropriate to factor out @xmath43 by @xmath47 the set of all null operators on @xmath37 , where @xmath48 means the support and @xmath49 is the annulus enlarged from @xmath2 by the interaction range @xmath29 .",
    "now , the particle types are conserved quantities under the operations of @xmath50 this set of operators forms a @xmath44-algebra , and for a thick but finite annulus , it is finite dimensional over complex numbers . recall that any finite dimensional @xmath44-algebra @xmath51 is isomorphic to a direct sum of full matrix algebras ( simple algebras ) , and there exist projectors @xmath8 in the center of @xmath51 onto the simple algebra components .",
    "the projectors , which we call * fundamental projectors * , are uniquely determined by the algebra @xmath51 from the conditions @xmath52 we conclude that the fundamental projectors in the center of @xmath51 is precisely the conserved operators .",
    "therefore , we _ identify _ the particle types of excitations , or anyon labels , that can be supported in the disk @xmath17 with the fundamental projectors of @xmath51 .",
    "an immediate observation is that any central element of @xmath51 should have the identity component on @xmath53 , since any full matrix algebra has trivial center consisting of scalars .",
    "this means that the fundamental projectors of @xmath51 is actually the fundamental projectors of the smaller algebra @xmath54 , which we call the * logical algebra * , on the annulus .",
    "we do _ not _ claim that we have derived the correspondence rigorously between the particle types and the fundamental projectors of the algebra @xmath51 .",
    "rather , mathematically , our argument should be regarded as a motivation to _ define _ particle types",
    ". remark that if there are completely disentangled qudits in the ground state , the logical algebra is invariant upon the removal of those qudits .",
    "specifically , suppose @xmath55 was a single - qudit operator of rank 1 acting on the qudit @xmath56 .",
    "any operator @xmath57 must have a form @xmath58 for some @xmath59 .",
    "but , the second term is annihilated by @xmath60 .",
    "if follows that @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the logical algebra is invariant for adding or removing disentangled degrees of freedom @xmath62 together with hamiltonian terms @xmath63 .",
    "let us apply our general definition of the particle types to a simple model , the @xmath64 gauge theory or the toric code model  @xcite .",
    "this will help developing some intuition about @xmath54 .",
    "our definition will reproduce what is known .",
    "the model is defined on a two - dimensional square lattice with two - dimensional degrees of freedom at each edge .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes four edges associated to a plaquette and @xmath67 denotes four edges associated to a vertex .",
    "the identity operators are inserted to make @xmath15 conform with our assumption that the hamiltonian is a sum of projectors .",
    "it is simple to verify that the product of @xmath68 along any closed loop of edges on the real lattice commutes with every vertex terms , and the product of @xmath69 along any closed loop of dual edges on the dual lattice commutes with every plaquette terms . here",
    ", the closed loop does not have to consist of a single loop ; any product of the loop operators commute with every term of @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , any operator that commutes with every plaquette and vertex term is a linear combination of the loop and dual loop operators .",
    "therefore , our algebra @xmath43 is precisely generated by the loop and dual loop operators supported on a given annulus .",
    "the set @xmath70 of all null operators on the annulus has to be examined carefully .",
    "let @xmath16 be any null operator . by definition , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the product of all @xmath39 whose",
    "support overlaps with the annulus .",
    "assume without loss of generality that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is minimum possible .",
    "we claim that each @xmath75 not only acts nontrivially on the annulus , but is in fact supported on the annulus . to see this ,",
    "suppose this is not the case .",
    "then , one can choose a qubit @xmath31 outside the annulus such that it is acted on by @xmath76 but not by @xmath75 for @xmath77 . since @xmath78 is a tensor product of pauli matrices",
    ", there is a pauli matrix @xmath79 acting on @xmath31 such that @xmath80 . using @xmath81",
    ", we have @xmath82 which is a contradiction to the minimality of @xmath74 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath83 is a two - sided ideal of @xmath43 generated by @xmath84 where the terms @xmath85 are supported on the annulus .",
    "next , we explain that , by factoring out by @xmath70 , the operators of @xmath43 can be `` deformed '' within the annulus .",
    "if @xmath57 is a loop operator consisting of @xmath68 , then @xmath86 for some @xmath68-type @xmath87 on the annulus that overlaps with @xmath16 , is another loop which is deformed from @xmath16 . in the quotient algebra ,",
    "the two operators are the same @xmath88 because @xmath89 .",
    "generalizing to multiple multiplications of elementary loops @xmath87 , we see that any two real or dual loop operators with the same winding number modulo 2 around the annulus are the same members of the quotient algebra .",
    "therefore , we have computed the logical algebra completely , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are dual and real loop operators , respectively , that wrap around the annulus once .",
    "the fundamental projectors of @xmath93 are @xmath94 we have named the projectors according to the conventional symbols for anyons of the model .",
    "this verifies our identification of particle types with the fundamental projectors of @xmath54 .",
    "a similar calculation proves the same conclusion for @xmath95 toric code , the quantum double model with the ( gauge ) group @xmath95 .",
    "the fundamental projectors are labeled by tuples @xmath96 .",
    "for general quantum double models , a similar calculation has been done by bombin and martin - delgado  ( * ? ? ?",
    "b ) , who show that the algebra @xmath43 on the thinnest possible annulus , known as a ribbon , is spanned by projectors onto definite particle type states .",
    "this is consistent with our identification because @xmath70 for the ribbon has to be zero according to their calculation .",
    "however , the calculation is insufficient to verify our identification since it does not show the structure of the operator algebra @xmath43 or @xmath70 for an annulus of non - minimal thickness . levin and wen  @xcite",
    "have computed ( string ) operators that commute with every term of hamiltonians possibly except at the ends for the string - net models .",
    "they have noted that particle types are identified with certain `` irreducible '' solutions of commutativity equations .",
    "this irreducibility depends on the structure of their particular equations .",
    "it would be a nontrivial task to adapt this irreducibility to our more general setting .",
    "consider a pair of large circular annuli @xmath97 and @xmath98 as shown in figure  [ fig : annuli ] .",
    "we require that the annuli are of comparable size with each other and their center is separated by a distance comparable to the radius .",
    "the intersection of the annuli then consists of two diamond - like regions @xmath99 and @xmath100 that are separated by a distance comparable to the radius .",
    "the configuration is to ensure that any local operator can only intersect at most one of @xmath99 or @xmath100 . for each of the annuli",

    "moreover , since the isomorphism @xmath526 is induced by @xmath23 , the fundamental projectors @xmath8 of @xmath527 will represent fundamental projectors of @xmath524 as @xmath528 . therefore , @xmath529 by lemma  [ lem : inv - twist - prod ] , and we will complete the proof of the theorem .",
    "the terms of the new hamiltonian @xmath224 is clearly commuting with one another , since the conjugation is an algebra - automorphism . to show that it is locally topologically ordered",
    ", we use the observation made in the proof of lemma  [ lem : evolved - invisibility ] . given a disk @xmath17 ,",
    "let @xmath530 be @xmath531-ball of @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath532 be the product of all terms @xmath42 of @xmath15 that are supported on @xmath530 , and define @xmath533 .",
    "@xmath534 is supported on @xmath535-ball of @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath147 be any state such that @xmath536 .",
    "we claim that the reduced density matrix on @xmath17 of @xmath147 is the same as that of @xmath537 on @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath538 , using the local topological order condition of @xmath15 , we know @xmath171 has the same reduced density matrix on the @xmath24-ball of @xmath17 as @xmath12 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath23 is a quantum circuit of range @xmath24 , the reduced density matrix on @xmath17 of @xmath539 is the same as that of @xmath162 .",
    "this proves the claim .    to show that @xmath524 is isomorphic to @xmath519 ,",
    "consider the conjugation by @xmath23 @xmath540 it is straightforward to check that @xmath541 , so @xmath542 is induced and well - defined . similarly , consider a map @xmath543 certainly , @xmath544 is the inclusion , so @xmath545 is an isomorphism by our stable logical algebra assumption .",
    "in particular , @xmath546 is surjective .",
    "we claim @xmath546 is injective as well .",
    "suppose @xmath547 . by the definition of @xmath548 , @xmath549",
    "and there exist @xmath319 supported on the annulus of thickness @xmath550 such that @xmath401 . the decomposition can be written equivalently as @xmath551 each @xmath552 is annihilated by @xmath553 which is supported on the annulus of thickness @xmath554 , where @xmath555 is the interaction range of @xmath556 .",
    "this means that @xmath557 , and the injectivity of @xmath546 is proved .",
    "therefore , @xmath546 is bijective .",
    "we conclude that @xmath558 is also bijective , and @xmath519 and @xmath559 are isomorphic .",
    "we have defined an invariant matrix @xmath6 under local unitary transformations for ground states of a particular class of commuting hamiltonians .",
    "@xmath6 is naturally motivated by braiding of quasi - particles and its modular tensor category description , but we have avoided dealing with the axioms of the categorical description , by analyzing operator algebras that stabilize the state from the beginning .",
    "our definition of @xmath6 matrix is in terms of the hamiltonian , complemented by a proof that @xmath6 is independent of the hamiltonian as long as it belongs to a class specified by the local topological order and stable logical algebra conditions .",
    "it is certainly desirable to have an invariant that is manifestly defined in terms of the bulk of the state .",
    "the topological entanglement entropy could be a good exemplary quantity , but we do not yet have a rigorous answer when this quantity is invariant .",
    "our notion of locally invisible operators would give much more information about the state , but they generally do not form an algebra , which makes it hard to extract useful information out .",
    "our local topological order and stable logical algebra assumptions constitute a sufficient condition for the locally invisible operators to form an algebra . perhaps , in two dimensions the stable logical algebra assumption may follow from the local topological order assumption , as the latter seems to imply number of particle types in 2d is bounded .",
    "this is an interesting open problem .",
    "another interesting problem is to determine when the unitarity of the @xmath30 matrix ( the modularity ) can be derived .",
    "note that this can not be proved unless some homogeneity is assumed .",
    "for example , if an annulus happens to include a gapped boundary , then the logical algebra may have different @xmath560-dimension from that on an annulus in the bulk .",
    "then , the @xmath6 matrix between the two logical algebras is not necessarily square .",
    "we have mainly discussed two - dimensional lattices , but a higher dimensional generalization is straightforward ; one can replace the annulus with spheres with a thick enough wall , or more generally consider any embedding of lower dimensional manifolds . in three dimensions for example , one can consider a sphere and a circle that are intersecting at a pair of distant points .",
