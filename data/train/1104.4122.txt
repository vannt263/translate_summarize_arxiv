    "much of the information we obtain on galaxies and their evolution is the consequence of the formation of stars , the process that depletes galaxies of their gas , dynamically energizes the stellar disks and enriches the interstellar medium with heavy elements through generations of evolving stars . despite its fundamental importance on nearly all scales of astronomy ,",
    "star formation is an exceedingly complex process to explore in the _ ab initio _ manner as a result of the many entangling aspects including the dynamical , geometrical , magnetic and chemical properties of ism , as well as the feedback that the young stellar objects exert on their surrounding environment by radiation , stellar wind and explosion of supernovae .    in spite of this difficulty , the well - established empirical scaling laws of star formation that connect the large - scale star formation rate ( sfr ) to interstellar medium ( ism ) properties already play a crucial role in establishing plausible scenarios for galaxy evolution , and serve as essential prescription in modeling and simulating galaxy formation and evolution . among them ,",
    "the most widely adopted power - law relationship known as schmidt law @xcite links the volume or surface density of sfr to that of the gas @xcite . from an observational point of view , a variety of sfr indicators are currently used , along with gas density information derived from emission lines of molecules ( e.g. co , hcn ) , to trace the relation between the birthrate of stars and their environment . by averaging over the whole disk of individual galaxies and taking the total ( atomic + molecular ) cold gas into account , a single power - law scaling between the surface density of star formation and gas ( the schmidt - kennicutt law , abbreviated as the s - k law ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) extending over five orders of magnitude in the gas density has been well established , taking the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( in @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( in @xmath15 ) denote the disk - averaged sfr and gas surface density , respectively .",
    "both parameters in this equation are , however , _ global _ quantities averaging over local values that may vary by several orders of magnitude .",
    "further understanding of star formation on a more physical basis requires scrutinizing galaxies at the sub - galactic scale .",
    "limited by development of the relevant instrumentation , spatially - resolved investigations of the gas content of individual star - forming sites have become a front - line topic only in recent years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "spatially - resolved studies promise to yield insights into the physical processes driving the scaling laws , much more directly than the disk - averaged results .",
    "measuring the star formation and gas at sub - kpc scales requires high resolution and sensitivity , which are currently available only for small or limited samples both for atomic hydrogen ( e.g. , through things ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k07 and b08 , respectively ) , which suggests that further investigations on the power law index of the s - k law should concentrate on the scaling relationship between sfr and molecular gas .    the availability of high resolution and sensitivity maps for co as the most commonly used molecular hydrogen tracer thus provide the main actual limitation to sub - kpc studies of star formation scaling laws .",
    "in general , interferometric co maps have higher resolution ( typically a few arcseconds ) and are powerful in resolving fine structures , but their limited field of view ( fov ) and the shortcoming of missing the zero spacing flux often downgrade their scientific value ; on the other hand , despite that single - dish observations are time - saving ( especially if on - the - fly mapping techniques are introduced ) and cover much wider fovs , their larger beams often smear out the details of star forming sites . in recent years , along with use of mosaicing that improves the fov of interferometry , the technique of compensating the absent short baselines components with single - dish data ( at the price of losing some resolution ) has been developed . with this technique",
    "mature , single - dish - compensated interferometric data of co transition line maps become the best available molecular gas tracer for investigations of star formation scaling laws . in this direction , a new carma ( the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ) & nro45 ( nobeyama radio observatory 45 m telescope ) co survey of nearby galaxies is underway @xcite with the goal of better understanding the evolution of the ism , galactic dynamics , and the star formation laws .",

    "this h@xmath1 + 24 @xmath2 m sfr motivated @xcite and b08 to propose another composite sfr tracer that corrects dust attenuation of far - uv ( fuv ) surface brightness using the same mid - ir component ( but with different weights ) .",

    "this convention continues in this paper , but we stress that the so - called `` local background '' here , apart from the local variation of sky or instrumental background , refers to the physical detection of the emission from stars or interstellar dust .",
    "pixel - by - pixel analysis introduces significant contamination from this local background especially in lower resolution images , in which case the low luminosity pixels can be more strongly affected than those at the bright end , effectively overestimating the sfrs at the faint end and thus flattening the slope of the scaling laws .    conventional approaches to determine the local background levels in galaxies include performing statistics in an annular region , or fitting the galactic image with an assumed two - dimensional analytical function ( e.g. , polynomial , exponential , srsic profile or a combination of several galactic components ) .",
    "these methods work reasonably well in general but often fail in nearby galaxies because of the large dynamical range and crowding of clustered regions . @xcite and k07 defined 12 rectangular regions in the m51a images that they used as their `` background '' areas .",

    "the @xcite procedure has the advantage of being astrophysically motivated , but the dig fraction recovered by these authors ( 11% ) is smaller than that recovered by photometric measurements either when the whole galaxy ( 4050% , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* using _ hiiphot _ ) .    in this work , we distinguish the compact component ( presumably h ii regions ) from diffuse stellar / dust emission through morphological examination .",
    "this strategy is inevitably arbitrary to some extent , but its basic motivation has a strong physical underpinning .",
    "the properties of the diffuse h@xmath1 , 24 @xmath2 m and uv emission have been extensively discussed by the existing literature , which is briefly reviewed in the discussion section .",
    "when such a strategy is being applied , the crowding of sources is the major obstacle to accurate background determination , but it can be circumvented by removing the compact clumps instead , which is done by adapting the algorithm of the idl software _ hiiphot _ developed by @xcite for our purposes in this work .",
    "the algorithm can be summarized as follows . on an h@xmath1 image of a galaxy",
    ", it identifies h ii regions by smoothing the image with kernels of different sizes , and utilizes object recognition techniques to identify significant peaks ( `` seeds '' ) .",
    "after that , an iterative procedure is started allowing for area growth from these `` seeds '' .",
    "the boundaries are built up at successively fainter isophotal levels that keep growing until either boundaries of other regions are encountered , or a pre - established lower limit to the gradient in surface brightness is reached implying its arrival at the background level .",
    "two - dimension interpolations are then carried out by fitting the background pixels around each h ii region to estimate the local background behind the source .    originally designed for automated photometric characterization and statistical analysis of h ii regions and their luminosity functions in h@xmath1 images , the algorithm of _ hiiphot _ can be easily adapted to 24 @xmath2 m and fuv images .",
    "we tested our implementation of _ hiiphot _ on the hst h@xmath1 image of m51a , and produced an h ii region luminosity function which is very similar to that of @xcite @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that our purpose of extracting star - forming regions against the local background is somewhat different from conventional h@xmath1 data analysis which aims at removing any contamination from diffuse components in h ii regions .",
    "the lower limit gradient in surface brightness for the iterative growing procedure from the `` seeds '' is thus chosen to be sufficiently low ( lower than what is typically chosen for h ii region analysis ) that we are confident to have reached an appropriate background level , but still sufficiently above zero to prevent growing deep into ambient areas .",
    "because of the much lower contribution from the diffuse emission in h@xmath1 than in mid - ir and fuv , the removal of the h@xmath1 local background is done conservatively , aiming at a background level to be reached only in the ambient area between the outer spiral arms . for the purpose of testing this approach , we also use a constant global background determined using several external h ii regions in deriving s - k laws , and the resultant slopes differ minimally ( @xmath49 , typically @xmath50.05 ) .",
    "the established source - free image is not smooth , but contains sharp edges at the boundaries of sources .",
    "we therefore smooth the image by calculating the median of the pixels enclosed in a moving box and replacing the central pixel with the median . because of the robustness of the median in statistics",
    ", this smoothing technique leads to a relatively stable result and suffers much less from the steep local variations which will affect an image smoothed by kernel convolution .",
    "the size of the box is chosen as a compromise between minimization of the crater - like artifacts left by the removed h ii regions and minimization of detail loss .",
    "the final resulting `` diffuse emission '' map is then ready for subtraction from the original image .",
    "the background - free images , along with the background images before and after the median smoothing , are shown in figure  [ fig : bkgd ] for the purpose of comparison .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the background - free image mostly contains clustered sources , and the disk - like diffuse emission has been removed .",
    "b08 performed a pixel - by - pixel analysis on 7 spiral galaxies detected in co ( @xmath0=21 ) at a resolution of 750 pc including m51a .",
    "the employed sfr tracer in their study is a combination of far - uv and 24 @xmath2 m luminosities without local background subtraction and whose coefficients are adjusted to be consistent with the h@xmath1 + 24 @xmath2 m sfr tracer at 750 pc resolution , the applicability of which has been justified in k07 and @xcite .",
    "no correlation between sfr and h i surface density is seen , a similar result to k07 . in contrary to the super - linear relationship found by k07 ( power law index @xmath50 ) , b08 find the surface density of sfrs to be proportional to that of molecular gas ( power index @xmath51 ) .",

    "investigations on scales larger than a quarter of this length will be of little significance because of the paucity of data points and of including a too large fraction of the galaxy . moreover , the high inclination of ngc 3521 makes the removal of the background non - star - forming light more complicated , which can affect our results especially on relatively larger scales . considering the inclination of ngc 3521 , 700 pc actually corresponds to a physical scale of @xmath52 kpc , which we take as a convenient limit for our study .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the molecular s - k law in m51a and ngc 3521 at different resolutions are reported in table  [ tab : results_m51 ] and table  [ tab : results_n3521 ] , where sfr is derived from the weighted sum of h@xmath1 and 24 @xmath2 m luminosities .",
    "figure  [ fig : res_dep ] demonstrates that @xmath88 has little dependence on spatial resolution in both galaxies , varying between 0.97 and 1.01 in m51a and between 0.99 and 1.04 in ngc 3521 .",
    "the weak ascending trend of @xmath88 is caused by the larger scatter at the faint end as discussed in the methodology section , and the uncertainty in background removal may also play a role .",
    "the fuv+24 @xmath2 m luminosity is therefore also a good sfr tracer as long as the diffuse emission component is properly removed .",
    "figure  [ fig : res_dep ] also reveals that the power - law indices of both the molecular and the total hydrogen s - k law decrease monotonically as the spatial scale increases .",
    "specifically , as the resolution decreases from 230 pc to 1 kpc , @xmath7 decreases from 1.9 to 1.2 , implying higher star formation efficiency ( defined as the sfr - to - gas surface density ratio ) in the denser regime of molecular gas on all sub - kpc but super - gmc scales . for the total gas ,",
    "we find @xmath68 decreases from 2.1 to 1.6 on the whole range of scales . at @xmath5500 pc resolution",
    ", we find steeper slopes ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) than k07 ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) , mainly because the new carma + nro45 data is more sensitive than the bima song map by a factor of @xmath52 , and has collected more diffuse emission from co , pushing the low density end to higher values",
    ". a even steeper slope would be found if we followed b08 , assumed no molecular gas outside the star - forming disk and fit the scaling relation on the whole isophotal area defined by @xmath69 .",
    "in contrast to m51a , the high inclination of ngc 3521 results in blending of star formation sites which complicates the removal of diffuse stellar / dust emission , and can affect our result on relatively larger scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : res_dep ] shows that the slopes of the s - k law of both the total and molecular gas and of the sfr indicator comparison for ngc 3521 are less certain and stable than m51a , indicating higher uncertainties in the local background subtraction . in addition , the fov of our carma observation covers only about half of the @xmath69 scale , missing the information from the outskirt of the disk where the transition from dominant molecular phase to dominant atomic phase in the cold gas occurs .",
    "this shortcoming tends to reduce the amount of data points in the regime slightly denser than @xmath93 and could have steepened the resulting slope .",
    "bearing in mind these potential issues , we still observe a descending trend similar to that of m51a in both @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , both quantities are smaller than in m51a at a given resolution : @xmath7 is flatter by @xmath94 , and @xmath6 smaller by @xmath95 .",
    "the power - law index of @xmath68 in ngc 3521 fluctuates weakly within the errors and persists between 2.1 and 2.2 , implying very weak or no dependence on the resolution .",
    "however , as we have mentioned above , this may due to the absence of the co data in the outer star - forming disk which hinders a complete sampling over the range of gas surface density .    the scatter or dispersion of the s - k law , quantitatively defined as the r.m.s . of the fitting residuals measured perpendicular to the best - fit line ,",
    "is an important parameter indicating the validity of the s - k law .",
    "the study of k07 suggests that the 500-pc - scale total - gas s - k law has a scatter almost twice as large of the 2-kpc - scale measurements in m51a , which becomes the first hint of the existence of some scale below which the total - gas s - k law breaks down .",
    "figure  [ fig : res_dep]-b reveals the monotonic decreasing trend of the scatter ( @xmath6 ) about the best - fit molecular s - k law as the resolution becomes lower on sub - kpc scales in both our program galaxies .",
    "@xcite analysed the carma + nro45 co data of ngc 4303 and find that the k - s law already breaks down at @xmath5250 pc resolution , and does not recover unless the data are smoothed to a scale of 500 pc or larger , especially in the disk region of the galaxy .",
    "converselly , @xcite show that a loosely correlated total s - k law exists down to 180 pc in m33 ( 0.84 mpc ) , and @xcite conclude that the s - k law of h@xmath29 in m33 becomes invalid only at the scale of gmcs ( @xmath580 pc ) . limited by the angular resolution , we are unable to reach scales below @xmath5200 pc , but significant scatter ( @xmath6=0.62 dex for m51a and 0.52 dex for ngc 3521 ) about the best - fit molecular s - k law is observed in both galaxies at their highest available resolution .",
    "when the linear size increases by a factor of 3 ( @xmath5700 pc ) , the scatter decreases to 0.48 ( m51a ) and 0.26 dex ( ngc 3521 ) .",
    "assuming the trend in figure  [ fig : res_dep ] [ b ] extends to smaller scales , a rough extrapolation gives a scatter of close to 0.7 dex at 80 pc scale , enough to mask any trend .",
    "the smoothly increasing scatter suggests the absence of a _",
    "characteristic _ breakdown scale of the s - k law , but the scaling relationship will be overcome by the large scatter gradually .",
    "higher resolution datasets are required to definitively pin down this issue .    as an exploratory experiment",
    ", we also attempt to find a common formulation that relates the observational results in the two galaxies , so that some hints for the underlying physical universality may be obtained .",
    "since the molecular s - k law is what should be focused on on sub - galactic scales , @xmath7 is of interest in the first place .",
    "furthermore , because the uncertainty in the photometric measurements is typically at the level of @xmath51020% , the dispersion about the best - fit s - k law is mainly intrinsic , as has been pointed out by previous studies ( k07 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath6 is a quantity of physical importance .",
    "the uncertainties of the slopes @xmath7 in tables  [ tab : results_m51 ] and [ tab : results_n3521 ] are , in fact , fitting errors , and are consistent in value with those already reported in the literature ( k07 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these uncertainties are not fully related to the dispersions @xmath6 , since , for instance , a larger dynamical range on the data could decrease the slope uncertainty , even at constant @xmath6 .",
    "hence the relevance of the intrinsic data scatter @xmath6 , which we report as separate columns in tables  [ tab : results_m51 ] and [ tab : results_n3521 ] .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath7 and @xmath6 are systematically smaller in ngc 3521 than in m51a .",
    "however , the resolution under consideration is the _ projected _ scale , and the comparison between the two galaxies should be made on the basis of _ physical _ or _ de - projected _ scales .",
    "we hence replot the dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath6 on @xmath8 ( @xmath96 ) in figure  [ fig : co_rel ] .",
    "as revealed by the two panels , on sub - kpc but super - gmc scales , both quantities are surprisingly consistent between the two galaxies .",
    "this remarkable result is a sign that we are approaching the scale where the physical origin of the s - k law is appearing .",
    "we are motivated to propose the following relations which hold in both galaxies : @xmath97+b,\\ ] ] and @xmath98+d,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is in dex , and @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these best - fit parameters are determined using the data of m51a only , which are superior than those of ngc 3521 in many respects , as explained above .",
    "the values change minimally if the latter is included in the fits because of the impressive overlap among the data ( figure  [ fig : co_rel ] ) .",
    "this overlap seemingly indicates a universal sub - kpc molecular s - k law that persists amongst spiral galaxies whose actual form depends only on the physical scale being considered .",
    "an extrapolation of the above expression for @xmath7 shows that a slope of unity requires a scale as large as @xmath103  kpc , roughly the typical spacing of adjacent spiral arms in disk galaxies similar to m51a and ngc 3521 .",
    "this has been verified in ngc 3521 ( figure  [ fig : res_dep]-a ) , where @xmath7 is consistent with unity within the error bars at the apparent scale @xmath104 pc ( table  [ tab : results_n3521 ] ) , which corresponds to a de - projected scale @xmath105 kpc .",
    "similarly , we find that the @xmath68 ",
    "@xmath106 correlation in m51a can be fitted to    @xmath107 + 1.60 $ ] .    for a projected scale @xmath106=1.80 kpc ( corresponding to 1.85 kpc if @xmath80=8.2 mpc is adopted as in k07 ) ,",
    "the extrapolation of the above function predicts @xmath68=1.36 , well consistent with the slope @xmath108 found at this resolution by k07 for the total hydrogen s - k law using the 14-m five college radio astronomical observatory co ( @xmath0=10 ) map @xcite . despite this consistency , we are aware of the uncertainties in deriving large scale information from the extrapolation of our sub - kpc study .",
    "the discussion above leads to a conclusion that caution must be taken in interpreting observational results , especially those of galaxies with high inclinations , which makes the intended sub - kpc studies actually `` super - kpc '' .",
    "linear or sub - linear molecular s - k laws may be found if spiral structures are not readily resolved .",
    "the heracles co ( @xmath0=21 ) data that is used by b08 has a resolution of 11  @xcite .",
    "this spatial resolution ( 430 pc at a distance of 8.03 mpc where ngc 3521 is located , or 570 pc at 10.7 mpc adopted by b08 ) translates to @xmath109 kpc , already close to the @xmath103 kpc unity - slope scale , and is virtually incapable of resolving the spiral structure of ngc 3521 , which is likely to be another important reason for the results in b08 in addition to preserving the local background in the sfr measurements .    at our highest available physical resolution ( @xmath8=320 pc ) in m51a ,",
    "the power indices of both the molecular and total hydrogen s - k laws are about 2 ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) .",
    "a slope as steep has never been reached in spatially - resolved studies of extragalactic star - forming disks , but has been observed inside the milky way .",
    "for instance , @xcite derive both the gas / dust distribution and sfr from cobe / dirbe data and find @xmath112 ; @xcite directly observed about 7000 young stellar objects ( ysos ) and obtain a slope @xmath52 , where the gas density is traced by dust extinction .",
    "our results in m51a are therefore very similar to these galactic investigations , which seems to hint at an `` intrinsic '' s - k law with slope @xmath52 in spiral galaxies , and the flatter power indices that have been found in other galaxies are actually a resolution effect . as a minimum , we have added evidence that a super - linear relation is found in extragalactic investigations supporting the recent results that the star formation efficiency positively correlates with the column density for galactic molecular clouds @xcite . as a caveat , our study has been performed only on two galaxies , and more data with better sensitivity , resolution and broader fov for a larger sample of galaxies are required to confirm the results presented in this section .",
    "among the sfr images , the extended background contamination is the most significant at 24 @xmath2 m .",
    "@xcite find that the ir - to - uv ratio is higher in the interarm regions of m101 than the arm regions , which they interpret as due to dust heated by optical photons in the interstellar radiation field . in order to account for the observed seds of dust emission",
    ", a dust model must include a substantial population of ultrasmall grains or large molecules with the vibrational properties of pah material and with sizes such that single - photon heating can excite the observed vibrational emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mid - ir emission is produced not only by dust grains heated by young stellar populations , but also , and in some areas predominantly , by dust heated by older stars through single - photon processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the latter component is unassociated with current star formation , and is likely to dominate the mid - ir emission in the faint , diffuse regions in galaxies . as a quantification of the amount of diffuse light at each position in the two galaxies , we show in figure  [ fig : diff ]",
    "the ratio of the compact ( background - subtracted ) emission to the diffuse component ( the subtracted background ) in h@xmath1 , 24 @xmath2 m and fuv as a function of h@xmath29 mass surface density at 400 pc resolution ( projected scale ) .",
    "it can be seen that , among the three wavelengths , the 24 @xmath2 m emission shows the most marked trend for increasing compact - to - diffuse ratio with increasing @xmath113 ( especially in m51a ) .",
    "the variation of the compact - to - diffuse ratio is broader at 24 @xmath2 m than h@xmath1 and fuv ( especially in m51a ) , in line with the strongest influence from its diffuse emission . in general",
    ", the fact that young stars form in dusty galactic environment leads often to the prevalence of dust - obscured sfr ( traced by ir ) over unobscured sfr ( traced by optical and uv ) , implying that the slope of the s - k law is mainly driven by the way the diffuse 24 @xmath2 m emission is handled .    in the fuv data , the diffuse component is also considerably stronger than in the h@xmath1 images @xcite , likely owing to the longer timescale over which uv continuum photons can be produced . as an example , it takes only 9 myr for the h@xmath1 emission of an instantaneous - burst population to diminish by two orders of magnitude , but takes about 100 myr at 1500   where the fuv band of galex resides @xcite . as a result of galaxy dynamics , over 100 myr ,",
    "the uv - emitting stars will have migrated away from their birth - site , and will have diffused across the galactic disk over an area at least 10 times larger than that of the ionizing - photon - emitting stars @xcite .",
    "this results in a vastly reduced contrast between the arm and interarm regions of galaxies in fuv ( @xmath515:1 in m51a after extinction correction ) relative to the h@xmath1 ( @xmath11430:1 in m51a ) , and also in a less obvious association between the location of the fuv emission and present - day star formation .",
    "investigations on the properties of diffuse uv emission have demonstrated that , the diffuse uv light is likely originating from evolved , disrupted stellar clusters that has migrated away from their birth - sites @xcite ; any assumptions of in - situ star formation for the diffuse uv light implies a steep imf which is either steeper than kroupa at the high mass end ( @xmath11510 - 20 @xmath116 ) or truncated ( down to 30 - 40 @xmath116 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to estimate the impact of the diffuse uv light , we assume that star formation proceeds at a roughly constant rate over 1 gyr , and that stars and molecular clouds remain closely associated over @xmath530  myr @xcite , in agreement with some observations for the oldest stars found in gmcs @xcite . stellar population synthesis models ( starburst99 , * ?",
    "* ) indicate that for constant star formation , 80% of the galex fuv light is produced by stars younger than 30 myr , and 20% by stars older than 30 myr .",
    "if the older stars get dispersed over the galactic disk , their mean dust attenuation will be lower than that of the younger stars , which are clustered in the spiral arms . using the opacity values of @xcite , @xmath1171.5  mag and @xmath1180.5  mag , and the conservative assumption of a mixed dust / star geometry , with a milky way extinction curve plus albedo @xcite , the contribution to the total _ observed _ fuv emission of a galaxy from stellar populations younger than 30  myr is only about 60% .",
    "other assumptions for the dust / star geometry and the effective attenuation will lead to smaller fractions contributed by the young star populations to the total observed fuv . in light of the above modeling , unless stellar populations significantly older than 30 myr remain closely associated to their birth cloud , at least a 40% fraction of `` diffuse '' uv light should be present .",
    "our strategy of diffuse emission subtraction presented here results in an observationally determined diffuse fuv fraction of 44% in m51a and 53% in ngc 3521 . by virtue of its lower inclination , m51a has a more reliable measurement , and our modeling and observation are therefore consistent .",
    "although removing the diffuse fuv emission is clearly a necessity for measuring sfrs , we have performed a test by making a sfr map of m51a with local background _ preserved _ for the fuv image but _ subtracted _ for 24 @xmath2 m .",
    "compared to our fiducial method of sfr tracing ( h@xmath1 + 24@xmath2 m with the background removed in both bands ) , this sfr map reduces the slope of the molecular s - k law @xmath7 from 1.42@xmath200.05 to 1.14@xmath200.04 at 750 pc resolution , higher than the slope 0.83@xmath200.04 obtained when both the fuv and 24 @xmath2 m backgrounds are preserved .",
    "thus , keeping the fuv background recovers a slope roughly half - way between those obtained when either removing or preserving both backgrounds .",
    "however , we still recover non - linear trends at high spatial resolution : @xmath7=1.39@xmath200.02 at 250 pc resolution , when preserving the fuv background and removing it from the 24  @xmath2 m image , to be compared with @xmath7=1.86@xmath200.03 , when the background is removed from both images .",
    "the stronger diffuse emission in uv relative to the h@xmath1 is the underlying reason for the deviation of the sfr@xmath55 vs. sfr@xmath53 correlation from a single power law at the faint end ( see figure  [ fig : m51_bima_comp]-c ) .",
    "as we have shown , this deviation can be calibrated by careful local background removal , whose necessity is thus justified by the need to include in our sfr indicators only the young stellar populations ( and the dust they heat ) involved in the _ current _ star formation activity . by including the local background contamination in their sfr estimates ,",
    "b08 systematically overestimates the current sfrs at the faint end , which affects the physical interpretations of their high quality observations .",
    "the h@xmath1 data are processed with our strategy as well , driven by the fact that a fraction of ionizing photons escape from h ii regions and result in the diffuse emission from ambient ionized gas unrelated to the current star formation at a specific location @xcite .",
    "another reason is that pixel - by - pixel analysis is highly sensitive to the low level uncertainty in flat - fielding , continuum subtraction and sky background removal and requires careful handling .",
    "in fact , this technical difficulty can be circumvented by using integral field spectroscopy , as is done by @xcite .",
    "the authors investigated the central 4@xmath164 kpc@xmath119 of m51a at 170 pc resolution , with the diffuse h@xmath1 emission corrected based on [ s ii]/h@xmath1 line ratio , as an alternative to the local background removal in k07 and our work . combining these data and the archival bima song co map",
    ", they fit the data through a monte carlo approach with upper limits included and find a sub - linear slope @xmath120 for the molecular s - k law , similar to 0.84 obtained by b08 .",
    "however , as they have pointed out , when an ordinary least - square ( ols ) bisector linear fitting excluding upper limits ( as throughout this paper , k07 and b08 ) is performed on their data , the slope steepens to 1.5 , close to @xmath51.4 found by k07 . at our highest available resolution ( 230 pc )",
    "when the same bima song map is used , we find a similar power index @xmath121 if we only exclude all data points with significance below 1@xmath34 as @xcite did , rather than our default 3@xmath34 .",
    "hence , they actually reach a conclusion consistent with k07 and this study , when noisy ( below 1@xmath34 ) co data are removed from their analysis .      in this work ,",
    "we have performed our analysis in a customary manner , i.e. by working above a certain sensitivity threshold ( 3-@xmath34 ) .",
    "@xcite simulate the likely distribution of non - detections so that data below 1-@xmath34 detection limits can be included in their power - law fitting . while this approach attempts to avoid data censoring , their strategy requires extremely accurate understanding and reliable modeling of the noise characteristics , which is a challenging enterprise especially for co maps .",
    "unfortunately , the current major limitation to spatially - resolved s - k law studies is the relatively low sensitivity of the co maps , and the real solution hinges on the higher quality of future co data ( through , e.g. alma ) .",
    "our carma + nro45 data for m51a is more sensitive than the bima song map that @xcite used by a factor of @xmath52 , and has higher image fidelity .",
    "figure  [ fig : co_comp ] compares these two maps at 230 pc scale ( corresponding to the bima song resolution ) , and demonstrates that the carma + nro45 observations recover slightly more flux at the faint end .",
    "therefore , although different fitting techniques are at play , we have probed the co emission to the same depth as @xcite , but at a much higher confidence level ( 2@xmath34 vs. 1@xmath34 ) .",
    "we now investigate the impact of imposing threshold values to our gas maps . as can be seen in figures  [ fig : m51_bima_comp]-[fig : n3521_sk ] , the 3-@xmath34 threshold has negligible impact on the sfr maps .",
    "in fact , varying the sfr threshold from 2@xmath34 to 4@xmath34 changes the best - fit slopes minimally ( within 0.03 ) .",
    "this remains true at all scales .",
    "most of the data censoring occurs on the gas maps .",
    "we test the reliability of our fits by varying the co map threshold from 1@xmath34 to 5@xmath34 , and the results are tabulated in table  [ tab : check_m51 ] and table  [ tab : check_n3521 ] .",
    "as can be seen from the various columns , decreasing the threshold of the co map flattens the slope @xmath7 at all scales , suggesting that the inclusion of noisy data has adverse effect on the determination of the s - k law . with future deeper co maps",
    ", our current 1-@xmath34 limits may become better detected , and enable a more accurate determination of the slope of the s - k law at low co masses .",
    "using our current well detected data , with thresholds 3-@xmath34 or higher , the slope of the molecular s - k law is clearly super - linear .    finally , one should be aware of the fact that because brightnesses at different wavelengths will often tend to correlate , causal relationships may be masked . in this work , this _ richness effect _ has been alleviated significantly when the underlying diffuse emission from dust and stars has been removed , and is thus of much less importance than in the study of b08 ( one may notice from figure  [ fig : bkgd ] that the background - subtracted images no longer appear disk - like ) . the absence of a clear correlation between sfr and atomic hydrogen ( especially when the local background component is subtracted , see figure  [ fig : m51_bima_comp]-d ) is an implication that our analyses are not dominated by this effect .",
    "further progress on this problem of how to measure sfrs _ locally _ within galaxies will require a careful modeling of the diffusion timescales of stellar populations in galaxies as they age , and the analysis of both the direct stellar light ( uv , h@xmath1 ) and the dust - reprocessed light ( ir ) from these evolving populations .",
    "we have presented a case study of the sub - kpc schmidt - kennicutt law of star formation in two nearby galaxies , m51a ( ngc 5194 ) and ngc 3521 , using our new carma + nro45 combined co ( @xmath0=10 ) maps of both galaxies with archival sings h@xmath1 , 24 @xmath2 m , things h i and galex fuv data . employing a new approach of local background determination",
    ", we use the same data sets as @xcite and @xcite and quantitatively show that the contrasting results of the two studies on whether the molecular s - k law is super - linear or linear is a result of removing or preserving the local background , this being the sum of the diffuse emission in galaxy disks and bulges from stars and dust .",
    "we argue that in order to plausibly derive sfr maps of nearby galaxies , the local mid - ir and fuv background should be subtracted carefully , in order to isolate the currently star - forming regions .",
    "applying this strategy , we perform a pixel - by - pixel analysis on different physical scales and find the power index of molecular s - k law ( @xmath7 ) to have similar behavior in these two galaxies .",
    "it is super - linear ( @xmath1151.5 ) at the highest available resolution ( @xmath5220 pc ) , and decreases monotonically as the resolution becomes lower .",
    "we also find in both galaxies that the scatter of the molecular s - k law @xmath6 monotonically increases as the resolution becomes higher , indicating a trend for which the s - k law breaks down below some scale simply by reaching a scatter as large as the trend to be measured . both @xmath7 and @xmath6",
    "are systematically larger in m51a than in ngc 3521 . however ,",
    "when plotted against the _ de - projected _ scale , both quantities become impressively consistent between the two galaxies , tentatively suggesting that the measured molecular s - k law in spiral galaxies may depend only on the size of the physical scale considered , but does not vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
