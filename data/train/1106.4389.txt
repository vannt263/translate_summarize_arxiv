    "in a ferromagnetic system , dynamics of space - time dependent magnetization vector @xmath0 is described by the following phenomenological equation @xcite @xmath1 this is the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation generalized to include the spin - transfer torque terms ( last two terms ) . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the functional derivative of energy with respect to @xmath3 , @xmath4 is gilbert damping constant , @xmath5 is saturation magnetization , @xmath6 is bohr magneton , @xmath7 is electron charge , @xmath8 is nonadiabaticity , and @xmath9 is spin polarized electric current given by difference between current by spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "llg equation describes the dynamics of magnetization under applied electromagnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "there exists a reciprocal process ; temporal and spatial variation of magnetization induces additional electromagnetic fields on conduction electrons .",
    "these fields are spin - dependent and in general nonconservative .",
    "thus the resulting spin - dependent motive force is called spin motive force ( smf ) .",
    "smf is firstly predicted by berger @xcite and recently formulated by generalizing faraday s law @xcite .",
    "it is also suggested @xcite that smf is also described by spin pumping effect @xcite .",
    "recently , smf and its effect is intensively studied @xcite in this field .    without any other perturbation ,",
    "the explicit expressions of the induced spin electromagnetic fields are known as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for spin - up and down electrons .",
    "the fields generate spin - dependent lorentz force @xmath13 . while the term  motive force \" refers to quantities of voltage dimension , the term smf",
    "is sometimes used to denote @xmath14 . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the latter terminology .",
    "it is easily noticed that smf is spin dependent , nonconservative , spatially varying , and localized in general situations .",
    "as one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) and ( [ b0 ] ) , smf is usually too small to be measured directly .",
    "another way is to study the effect of smf on magnetization dynamics .",
    "since smf induces additional spin current , additional spin - transfer torque arises and it changes llg equation .",
    "consequently , llg equation ( without applied spin current ) is modified as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is modified damping tensor given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is electrical conductivity .",
    "however , the previous work has a crucial limitation that spin density has been considered to be constant while spin density in reality is nonuniform since smf is spatially varying . the main consequence of the nonuniform spin density @xmath20 is diffusion current proportional to @xmath21 , which suppresses the effect of smf .",
    "therefore , a realistic model should take into account spin accumulation ( nonuniform spin density ) , diffusion and spin - flip scattering .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find the spin density @xmath22 , diffusion current , total current induced by smf , and their effect on magnetization dynamics in the presence of spin accumulation , diffusion , and spin - flip scattering .",
    "as one shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec_solution ] , the solution of @xmath22 in the most general situation is too complicated to study the effect on magnetization dynamics . to obtain simple analytic expressions",
    ", we take an approximation that spin - flip time is much shorter than the time scale of magnetization dynamics . as a final comment",
    ", our result does not assume any specific form of smf .",
    "thus , it remains valid for the modified smf due to , for instance , nonadiabaticity @xcite , spin - orbit coupling @xcite , and other kinds of spin dependent electric field @xcite .",
    "several previous works are closely related to our work . spin drift - diffusion equation , which has similar form to our theory",

    ", the effect on spin and charge current is investigated from boltzmann equation in ref .",
    "we set our starting point as the equation of motion of conduction electrons in ref .",
    "@xcite to make our analysis consistent with previous theories in this field .",
    "different from the previous theories focusing on 1d , we successfully generalized our result to 3d , and found that nonconservative part of smf plays a crucial role in current in a higher dimensional system . in sec .",
    "[ sec_solution ] , we compare our result with the previous theory qualitatively and quantitatively . in addition , we investigated the effect of charge neutrality on our results .",
    "it turns out that charge neutrality potential does not change our principal results , charge current and spin current , even though it changes charge density and spin density .",
