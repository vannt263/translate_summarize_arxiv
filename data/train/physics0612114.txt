    "the optical properties of nematic liquid crystals ( nlcs ) have long been known to play a key part in a large variety of their applications  @xcite .",
    "typically , nlcs are used as optically anisotropic materials where the anisotropy is determined by the orientational structure which is sensitive to external fields and , in restricted geometries , can also be influenced by changing the boundary conditions .",
    "similar to other anisotropic materials , the polarization state of light propagating through a liquid crystal varies due to the presence of the anisotropy .",
    "when the nlc cell is placed between two crossed polarizers , these anisotropy induced changes of the polarization manifest themselves in variations of the intensity of the transmitted light .",
    "this effect underlines the vast majority of experimental techniques devised to characterize orientational structures in nlc cells .",
    "for example , the crystal rotation technique  @xcite relies on analyzing the angle dependence of the transmittance of nlc cells placed between crossed polarizers .",
    "it can be regarded as a special case dealing with one - dimensional cross - section of the conoscopic pattern . nowadays",
    "the conoscopy is proved to be a useful tool for studying liquid crystal systems .",
    "it is used to detect biaxiality of nlcs  @xcite and to measure the pretilt angle in uniaxial liquid crystal cells  @xcite .",
    "orientational structures and helix unwinding process in ferroelectric smectic liquid crystals were also studied by conoscopy in refs .",
    "the conoscopic patterns of hybrid nlc cells were investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are aimed to study the polarization structure behind the conoscopic images by performing a comprehensive analysis of the polarization state of the light transmitted through a nlc cell as a function of the incidence angles .",
    "technically , we deal with angular two - dimensional distribution of the stokes parameters describing the field of polarization ellipses which might be called the _",
    "polarization resolved conoscopic ( angular ) pattern_.    it was originally recognized by nye  @xcite that the important elements characterizing the geometric structure of such polarization fields are the so - called _ polarization singularities_. in particular , these are the _ c points _ [ the points where the light wave is circularly polarized ] and the _",
    "l lines _ [ the curves along which the polarization is linear ] . over the past two decades",
    "these singularities and related issues have been the subject of numerous theoretical , experimental and numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "the theory of polarization singularities was applied to study the angular dependence of the polarization of plane wave eigenmodes in birefringent dichroic chiral crystals  @xcite .",
    "the polarization state of the electric displacement field was analyzed in relation to the direction of the wave vector .",
    "this analysis was recently generalized and extended to a more complicated case of bianisotropic media  @xcite .",

    "@xcite deal with the unfolding of a linearly polarized laguerre - gauss ( lg@xmath1 ) beam with an on - axis vortex on propagation through a birefringent crystal .",
    "it was found that a complicated pattern of polarization singularities is formed as a result of the anisotropy induced symmetry breaking .",
    "paraxial propagation of a beam carrying the angular momentum along the optic axis of a uniaxially anisotropic medium was also studied in refs .",
    "interestingly , there are a number of dynamical effects induced by a light beam normally impinging on a homeotropically aligned nlc cell  @xcite where liquid crystals appear as unique anisotropic materials sensitive to the spin and orbital angular momentum of light .    in this study",
    "we adapt a systematic theoretical approach and explore the characteristic features of the polarization structure ( the polarization resolved angular pattern ) emerging due to interference of four eigenmodes excited in nlc cells by the plane waves with varying direction of incidence .",

    "we show that there are concentric circles each containing four symmetrically arranged c points of alternating handedness . for these c points ,",
    "we obtain the analytical expressions for the topological index and for the discriminant whose sign determines the type of the point according to the line classification .",
    "the index and the handedness of the c points are found to alternate in sign along the radial direction .",
