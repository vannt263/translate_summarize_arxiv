    ". one interesting consequence of the oscillations of the pair amplitude is spatially damped oscillating behavior of the density of states ( dos ) in a ferromagnet predicted theoretically @xcite . in a strong ferromagnet",
    "the exchange field breaks the induced cooper pairs , while for a weak exchange field the pair amplitude can be _ enhanced _ and the energy dependent dos can have a zero - energy peak @xcite . since dos is a fundamental quantity , this _ resonant proximity effect _ can influence various transport phenomena . in our recent paper @xcite the dos peak",
    "was studied in two regimes of weak and strong proximity effect and the conditions for the appearance of this dos anomaly were clarified .",
    "however , its consequence for the junction conductance was not systematically investigated so far .",
    "it is known that in contacts involving unconventional superconductors the so - called zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) takes place due to the formation of the midgap andreev resonant states ( mars ) @xcite .",
    "an interplay of the resonant proximity effect with mars in df/@xmath1-wave superconductor ( df / d ) junctions is an interesting subject which deserves theoretical study .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to formulate theoretical model for the proximity effect in the normal metal / df/@xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superconductor ( n / i / df / i / s ) junctions and to study the influence of the resonant proximity effect due to the exchange field on the tunneling conductance and the dos .",
    "a number of physical phenomena may coexist in these structures such as impurity scattering , oscillating pair amplitude , phase coherence and mars .",

    "<S> resonant proximity effect in the normal metal / insulator / diffusive ferromagnet / insulator / @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superconductor ( n / i / df / i / s ) junctions is studied for various regimes by solving the usadel equation with the generalized boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> conductance of the junction and the density of states in the df layer are calculated as a function of the insulating barrier heights at the interfaces , the magnitudes of the resistance , thouless energy and the exchange field in df and the misorientation angle @xmath2 of a @xmath1-wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the resonant proximity effect originating from the exchange field in df layer strongly modifies the tunneling conductance and density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that , due to the resonant proximity effect , for @xmath0-wave junctions a sharp zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) appears for small thouless energy , while a broad zbcp appears for large thouless energy . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this zbcp can exceed the normal state conductance in contrast to the case of diffusive normal metal / superconductor junctions . </S>",
    "<S> similar structures exist in the density of states in the df - layer . for @xmath1-wave junctions at @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> similar structures are predicted in the conductance and the density of states . with the increase of the angle @xmath2 , the magnitude of the resonant zbcp decreases due to the formation of the mid gap andreev resonant states . </S>"
