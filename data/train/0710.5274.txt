    "the suppression of @xmath5 production in relativistic heavy ion collisions maybe one of the important signatures to identify the possible phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the dissociation of the @xmath5 in the quark - gluon plasma due to color screening can lead to a reduction of its production , on the other hand , the @xmath5 suppression maybe already present in the hadron - nucleus collisions .",
    "it is necessary to know absorption of the @xmath5 by the co - mover light mesons before we can make a definitive conclusion .",
    "the values of the @xmath5 absorption cross sections by the light hadrons are not known empirically , we have to resort to some theoretical approaches . among existing approaches , the one - meson exchange model and the effective @xmath2 theory",
    "are typical @xcite .",
    "the detailed knowledge about the strong coupling constants which are basic parameters in the effective lagrangian is of great importance .",
    "furthermore , the strong coupling constants among the charmed mesons and light - mesons play an important role in understanding final - state interactions in the hadronic @xmath6 decays @xcite",
    ".    there have been many works dealing with the strong coupling constants concerning the charmed mesons , see e.g. refs.@xcite . in ref.@xcite , the authors calculate the strong coupling constant @xmath7 with the qcd sum rules , and obtain much larger value than what expected from the effective @xmath2 theory . in this article , we calculate the value of the @xmath8 with the light - cone qcd sum rules .",
    "the light - cone qcd sum rules carry out the operator product expansion near the light - cone @xmath9 instead of the short distance @xmath10 while the non - perturbative matrix elements are parameterized by the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( which classified according to their twists ) instead of the vacuum condensates @xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as : in section 2 , we derive the strong coupling constant @xmath1 with the light - cone qcd sum rules ; in section 3 , the numerical result and discussion ; and in section 4 , conclusion .",
    "we study the strong coupling constant @xmath11 with the two - point correlation function @xmath12 , @xmath13 where the currents @xmath14 and @xmath15 interpolate the vector mesons @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , the external state @xmath18 has the four momentum @xmath19 with @xmath20 .    according to the basic assumption of current - hadron duality in the qcd sum rules @xcite ,",
    "we can insert a complete series of intermediate states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators into the correlation function to obtain the hadronic representation . after isolating the ground state contributions from the pole terms of the mesons @xmath21 , we get the following result , @xmath22 where the following weak decay constant and phenomenological lagrangian have been used , @xmath23 here @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we carry out the operator product expansion for the correlation function @xmath26 in perturbative qcd theory , and obtain the analytical expressions at the level of quark - gluon degrees of freedom , then perform the double borel transformation and match the quark - hadron duality below the threshold @xmath27 , finally we obtain the sum rule for the strong coupling constant @xmath1 , @xmath28-\\exp\\left[- \\frac{s^0_{\\rho}}{m^2 } \\right ] \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\exp\\left[- \\frac{m_c^2+u_0(1-u_0)m_{\\rho}^2}{m^2 } \\right]\\left\\ { \\left[f_{\\rho}^\\perp - f_{\\rho}\\frac{m_u+m_d}{m_{\\rho}}\\right]m_c m_{\\rho}^2   h_{||}^{(s)}(u_0 ) \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.-\\frac{f_{\\rho } m_{\\rho}^3a(u_0)}{4 }   \\left[1 + \\frac{m_c^2}{m^2}\\right ] -   \\frac{2f_{\\rho}m_c^2 m_{\\rho}^3}{m^2 } \\int_0^{u_0 } d\\tau \\int_0^\\tau dt c(t)\\right\\ } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 here we have neglected the contributions from the gluons , the contributions proportional to @xmath30 can give rise to three - particle ( and four - particle ) meson distribution amplitudes with a gluon ( and quark - antiquark pair ) , their corrections are always suppressed by the large borel parameter and will not exceed @xmath31 , for examples , one can consult the last two articles of ref.@xcite . in calculation , the two - particle @xmath18 meson light - cone distribution amplitudes up to twist-4 have been used , for explicit expressions , one can consult ref.@xcite . due to the special tensor structure @xmath32",
    ", some two - particle twist-4 light - cone distribution amplitudes have no contributions .",
    "the parameters in the light - cone distribution amplitudes are scale dependent , in this article , we take @xmath33 . as the dominating contribution ( about @xmath34 )",
    "comes from the two - particle twist-2 term involving the @xmath35 , for other terms , the continuum subtractions will not affect the result remarkably , we can neglect the subtractions . in some cases ,",
    "the contributions from the two - particle twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes are very large ( or dominating ) @xcite , they depend heavily on the currents we choose to interpolate the mesons .",
    "the input parameters are taken as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the central value of the decay constant @xmath57 from lattice simulation is about @xmath58 @xcite . in this article",
    ", we take the value @xmath59 from the two - point qcd sum rules without perturbative @xmath60 corrections for consistency .",
    "the duality threshold parameter @xmath27 is chosen to be @xmath61 , the numerical ( central ) value of @xmath27 is taken from the qcd sum rules for the mass of the @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the borel parameters are chosen as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in those regions , the value of the @xmath1 is rather stable , the uncertainty from the borel parameter is very small , less than @xmath65 .    in the limit of large borel parameter @xmath66 ,",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath1 takes up the following behavior , @xmath67 it is not unexpected , the contribution from the twist-2 light - cone distribution amplitude @xmath35 is greatly enhanced by the large borel parameter @xmath66 , its contribution is dominating , about @xmath34 , ( large ) uncertainties of the relevant parameters presented in above equation have significant impact on the numerical result .",
    "the main uncertainties come from the two parameters @xmath57 and @xmath68 , variations of the two parameters can lead to large uncertainties , about @xmath69 .    taking into account all the uncertainties ,",
    "finally we obtain the numerical value for the strong coupling constant @xmath1 , which is shown in fig.1 , @xmath70 if we take the replacement @xmath71 \\rightarrow \\exp\\left[- \\frac{m_c^2+u_0(1-u_0)m_{\\rho}^2}{m^2 } \\right]-\\exp\\left[- \\frac{s^0_{\\rho}}{m^2 } \\right ] $ ] to subtract the continuum contributions of the terms besides the twist-2 light - cone distribution amplitude , the central value @xmath72 will decrease about @xmath65 .",
    "comparing with the values from the effective @xmath2 symmetry and vector meson dominance theory , @xmath73 @xcite , our numerical value @xmath74 is much smaller . in the vector meson dominance theory , @xmath75 , the contributions from the radial excited states @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79",
    "are neglected .",
    "we can make a crude estimation with the simple replacement @xmath80 to take into account the contribution from the @xmath76 , @xmath81 , our numerical result is reasonable , the @xmath2 symmetry breaking effect for the strong coupling constants is small . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors introduce some functions to parameterize the form - factor for small spacelike @xmath82 , then extrapolate to the mass shell , much larger value is obtained , @xmath83 . although the model functions have solid theoretical foundation at large @xmath82 , extrapolation to the mass shell may have good or bad behaviors , which correspond to the systematic errors .",
    "it is not unexpected that the values from the qcd sum rules and light - cone qcd sum rules are different .     with the borel parameter @xmath66 .",
    "in this article , we analyze the vertex @xmath0 with the light - cone qcd sum rules .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath1 is an important parameter in evaluating the charmonium absorption cross sections in searching for the quark - gluon plasmas .",
    "our numerical value for the @xmath1 is consistent with the prediction of the effective @xmath2 symmetry and vector meson dominance theory .",
