    "a representative volume element ( rve ) of any heterogeneous material may be viewed as a unit cell of a periodic composite .",
    "but photonic and phononic crystals with their periodic arrangement of identical unit cells of structured constituent geometry and material properties , uniquely posses a wealth of special elastodynamic / electromagnetic characteristics that are not shared by an arbitrary rve .",
    "these crystals display band structure and have dispersion responses that vary with frequency and wave vector , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the overall response of these crystals is fully defined by the geometry and material properties of their typical unit cell . therefore , their homogenized effective properties for bloch - form waves @xcite can be calculated by simple spatial volume averaging of the field variables over a typical unit cell in such a manner that both continuity and periodicity are preserved .",
    "this approach was introduced in @xcite , @xcite for one - dimensional phononic crystals , and it is the approach we use in the present work .",
    "the resulting constitutive material parameters , obtained by this averaging scheme , together with the corresponding averaged field equations , will then by necessity produce the exact band structure of the original heterogeneous crystal .",
    "they are functions of the wave frequency and wave vector , are unique , and fully embody the refractive characteristics of the original composite .",
    "they may take on positive or negative values depending on the frequency and the wave vector .",
    "hence the homogenized material may behave either as a normal composite or it may behave as a so - called metamaterial .",
    "we also show how this structure can be controlled and modified using anisotropic matrix materials and simple unit - cell geometries .",
    "we believe our results and the proposed method of analysis are new and should provide powerful tools for designing novel photonic or phononic crystals . indeed , exploiting this , we show for the first time , that negative refraction with positive phase velocity refraction can be realized _ and controlled on a wide frequency - range of the first ( lowest ) pass band _ of simple photonic and phononic crystals .",
    "luo et al . (",
    "2002 ) have demonstrated negative refraction in a photonic crystal consisting of circular holes placed in a square - lattice pattern within a homogeneous and isotropic dielectric matrix . by interfacing the crystal with air along",
    "its ( 11)-direction , they observed that negative refraction for te waves can occur in a narrow frequency ( about 6.1% ) at the far edges of the first pass band . in the present paper , we demonstrate a rich body of refractive characteristics that can be realized in photonic and phononic crystal over a wide region of the first pass band by suitably combining the square geometric anisotropy with material anisotropy , suggesting that this can be further enhanced by using a rectangular lattice structure .",
    "an alternative method of homogenization is to consider a uniform reference medium with assumed constant properties and then introduce and calculate the necessary polarization strain - momentum or stress - velocity fields in the phononic case and polarization electric and magnetic fields in the photonic case such as to produce point - wise the actual field variables . for elastodynamic and electromagnetic homogenization using this approach , willis has developed general variational principles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite .",
    "the polarization approach has also been used by @xcite to homogenize the electromagnetic properties of periodic media ( photonic crystals ) , and by the present author and srivastava @xcite , @xcite to homogenize phononic crystals ; see also @xcite for comments .",
    "there are other methods for calculating the effective properties ; see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references cited therein . here",
    "we use the direct field averaging for calculation of the effective properties that requires expressions of the periodic part of the field variables .",
    "the accurate calculation of these periodic parts for two- and three - dimensional phononic / photonic crystals is a formidable task for unit cells consisting of constituents of diverse properties with discontinuities .",
    "naturally , the accuracy of the final results , whether obtained by direct calculation or through the corresponding effective properties , will depend on the accuracy of the estimate of the periodic part of the field variables , though both methods will yield exactly the same results .",
    "there are only limited computational tools that can be employed , each with its own limitations , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we use a mixed variational formulation to calculate the band structure and the periodic part of the field variables @xcite . in this approach , both the displacement and stress fields in the phononic and the electric and magnetic fields in the photonic crystals are varied independently .",
    "hence they may be approximated by any continuously differentiable set of complete base functions , even though in actuality the gradients of some of the field variables may suffer large discontinuities across interfaces of various constituents of a typical unit cell .",
    "being based on a variational principle , any set of approximating functions can be used for the calculations , e.g. , plane - wave fourier series or finite elements @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the mix variational approach produces very accurate results and the rate of convergence of the corresponding series solution is superior to alternative methods @xcite . the general approach has been used to develop a fast and accurate computational platform for band structure calculations @xcite , where it is shown that this approach provides a greater convergence rate than the usual rayleigh quotient , especially in the presence of large material discontinuities ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the calculation details are given in section ( [ appendixa ] ) . in section ( [ examples ] )",
    "we work out three numerical examples and also show that the homogenized effective medium does indeed embody the exact band structure of the original heterogeneous periodic composite , which clearly distinguishes it from any anisotropic normal material .",
    "we also show that negative refraction can occur on the first ( acoustic ) pass band .",

    "all the field variables are functions of @xmath21 only since the time variable is incorporated into the field equations . when the principal axes of the material parameters are , respectively , in the @xmath41-directions , then @xmath42 and @xmath22 .",

    "we average the periodic parts of the field equations as well as the periodic parts of the constitutive equations over a typical unit cell of the composite . in this manner",
    "the effective parameters are obtained independently of the conservation equations .",
    "substitution of the resulting effective parameters into the averaged conservation relations should then yield the exact band structure in each case .",
    "the method in universal and can be used in two- and three - dimensional cases with impunity .",

    "we consider a simple two - phase photonic crystal that consists of a homogeneous anisotropic dielectric matrix containing 1.5 mm holes , periodically spaced 4 mm apart in both the @xmath70- and @xmath71-directions .",
    "using thermoplastic co - extrusion fabrication or other methods , low - loss dielectric composites of various degrees of anisotropy can be fabricated ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite . here ,",
    "for illustration , we use a matrix with dielectric constants of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where the superimposed _",
    "m _ denotes the matrix dielectric tensor . to examine the effect of the microstructure of the unit cell on the response of the resulting medium",
    ", we consider two cases that differ from one another only by a different arrangement of the principal axes of the matrix dielectric tensors relative to the @xmath21-coordinate directions , i.e. , in relation to the periodicity of the original composite .",

    "<S> it is shown , for the first time , that negative refraction with positive phase velocity refraction can be realized ( and controlled ) over a wide range of frequency on the first ( lowest ) pass band of simple photonic and phononic crystals .    </S>",

    "<S> then the correspondence between phononic and photonic field equations is established and their effective homogenized material parameters are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> finally illustrative examples are worked out for each case , revealing a rich body of refractive characteristics of these crystals , and showing by means of these examples that the homogenized effective parameters do yield the exact results , and that _ the resulting homogenized medium does in fact embody exactly the actual band structure and dispersive properties of the considered phononic / photonic crystal . </S>",
    "<S> _ as a consequence when the homogenized medium is placed in contact with a normal homogeneous half - space , _ it could display , even on the first pass band , positive , negative , or even no energy refraction depending on the frequency and wave vector of plane waves incident from the normal homogeneous solid to the interface . _    the unit cell of the crystal may consist of anisotropic constituents of any constant or variable properties that may also admit large discontinuities . </S>",
