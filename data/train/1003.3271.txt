    "when langlands , pichet , pouliot and saint - aubin ( @xcite ) were doing computer simulations to test the conformal invariance of percolation , there were several different events whose probability they measured .",
    "the first event that they studied was the probability that there is a percolation crossing connecting two disjoint boundary segments . using conformal field theory , @xcite derived his now - famous formula for this crossing probability , and the formula was later proved rigorously by @xcite for site percolation on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "the next event that langlands et al . tested was the probability that there is both a percolation crossing connecting the two boundary segments and a percolation crossing connecting the complementary boundary segments ( see figure  [ fig : cardy - watts ] ) .",
    "this probability also appeared to be conformally invariant , but finding a  formula for it was harder , and it was not until several years after cardy s formula that @xcite proposed his formula for the probability of this double crossing .",
    "watts considered the derivation of the formula unsatisfactory , even by the standards of physics , but it matched the data of langlands et al . very well , which lent credibility to the formula .",
    "watts formula was proved rigorously by @xcite .",
    "to express cardy s formula and watts formula for the two types of crossing events , since the scaling limit of percolation is conformally invariant , it is enough to give these probabilities for one canonical domain , and this is usually taken to be the upper half - plane .",

    "in the course of reaching his own understanding of watts formula , schramm simplified dubdat s proof , with the help of a mathematica notebook , and it was this version that he presented at microsoft on may 17 , 2004 .",
    "this proof did not come up again until an august 2008 centre de recherches mathmatiques ( crm ) meeting on sle in montral , after a talk by jacob simmons on his work with kleban and ziff on `` watts formula and logarithmic conformal field theory '' [ @xcite ] .",
    "schramm mentioned that he had an easier proof of watts formula , which he recalled after just a few minutes .",

    "it is an elementary fact that exactly one of the following two events occurs :    there is a horizontal blue crossing in the rectangle ( i.e. , a path of blue hexagons connecting the left and right edges of the rectangle ) , which we denote by @xmath45 ;    there is a vertical yellow crossing , which we denote by @xmath46 .",

    "thus exactly one of the following three events occurs :    there is no horizontal crossing of either color ( denoted by @xmath47 ) ;    there is a blue t ( denoted @xmath48 ) ;    there is a yellow t ( denoted @xmath49 ) .",
    "of course the latter two events have equal probability , so we have @xmath50 + 2 \\pr[t_b ] = 1.\\ ] ]    recall again that there is either a blue horizontal crossing or a yellow vertical crossing but not both .",
    "we can decompose the yellow vertical crossing event into two subevents according to whether or not there is also a  yellow horizontal crossing .",
    "the first subevent is , of course , the event we are interested in ( with blue and yellow reversed ) , and the second subevent is identical to the event @xmath47 .",

    "therefore the triple derivatives agree , and we have established ( [ pa ] ) .",
    "we have the established equivalence of@xmath93 and @xmath55 , but we still need to make the connection to percolation .    [ t.watts ]",
    "let @xmath204 be a fixed bounded jordan domain with marked points @xmath205 on its boundary .",
    "for any @xmath154 , we may consider the hexagonal lattice rescaled to have side length @xmath154 and color the faces blue and yellow according to site percolation .",
    "let @xmath206 be the closure of the set of blue faces , and let @xmath207 be the probability that @xmath208 contains a connected component that intersects all four boundary segments @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath209 . then @xmath210    proving theorem [ t.watts ] solves the problem addressed by watts .",
    "however , we remark that more general statements are probably possible .",
    "any domain  @xmath211 with four marked boundary points has a `` center '' @xmath212 with the property that a conformal map taking the domain to a rectangle ( and the points to the corners ) sends @xmath78 to the center of the rectangle .",
    "oded would probably have preferred to show that for any sequence @xmath213 of simply connected _ marked hexagonal domains _ ( domains comprised of unions of hexagons within a  fixed hexagonal lattice @xmath214 with four marked boundary points of cross ratios @xmath215 converging to @xmath26 ) , the probability of the watts event tends to @xmath54 provided that the distance from @xmath216 to @xmath217 tends to  @xmath135 .",
    "( oded s sle convergence results are similarly general [ @xcite , schramm and sheffield ( @xcite ) ] . )",
    "however , oded s derivation of watts formula ( like dubdat s derivation ) depends on sle@xmath31 convergence , and existing sle@xmath31 convergence statements [ e.g. , @xcite ] are not quite general enough to imply this .",
    "proof of theorem [ t.watts ] as shown in section [ s.tripodreduction ] , it suffices to prove the analogous statement about tripod events @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and the function @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath218 be a sequence of positive reals tending to zero , and define @xmath219 to be the random interface in @xmath211 obtained from percolation on @xmath218 times the hexagonal lattice , between the lattice points closest to @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "let  @xmath220 be the tripod set for this interface and the points @xmath0 and @xmath2 , that is ,  @xmath221 is the first point on @xmath222 outside the boundary segment @xmath89 , and the interface @xmath219 up to point @xmath221 last hits the boundary intervals @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath223 and @xmath224 , respectively . from the work of @xcite",
    ", we can couple the @xmath219 and @xmath30 in such a way that @xmath225 almost surely in the uniform topology ( in which two curves are close if they can be parameterized in such a way that they are close at all times ) . by the compactness of @xmath226 ( and the corresponding compactness  in the topology of convergence in law  of the space of measures on @xmath226 ) it is not hard to see that there must be a subsequence of the @xmath227 values and a coupling of the @xmath219 with  @xmath30 in which the entire quadruple @xmath228 converges almost surely to some limit .",
    "if we could show further that this limit must be @xmath229 almost surely , this would imply the theorem , since uniform topology convergence would imply that if @xmath30 hits @xmath76 before @xmath77 then @xmath219 hits @xmath223 before @xmath224 for large enough @xmath227 almost surely .",
    "however , it is not clear a priori that this limit is @xmath229 almost surely ( even though the @xmath219 converge to @xmath30 ) , since while @xmath30 touches the boundary at @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , it could be that @xmath219 comes close to the boundary at these points without touching it .    to obtain a contradiction ,",
    "let us suppose that there is a uniformly positive probability ( i.e. , bounded away from @xmath190 as @xmath230 ) that , say , the limit of the  @xmath223 is not @xmath76 .",
    "( the argument for the @xmath224 and the @xmath221 is essentially the same . )",

    "now we can expand the jordan domain @xmath211 to a larger jordan domain @xmath237 that includes a neighborhood of @xmath235 , but where the boundary of @xmath237 agrees with boundary of @xmath211 outside of @xmath236 .",
