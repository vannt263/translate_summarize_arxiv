    "recent observation of atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies , particularly that in the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite , has provided robust evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed .",
    "analyses of the atmospheric neutrino deficit favor @xmath2 as the dominant oscillation mode with the mass - squared difference @xmath3 and the mixing factor @xmath4 at the @xmath5 confidence level . as for the solar neutrino anomaly , there are four possible solutions belonging to two categories : ( a ) solar @xmath6 neutrinos changing to active @xmath7 or sterile @xmath8 neutrinos due to the long - wavelength vacuum oscillation with the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite ; ( b ) the matter - enhanced @xmath11 or @xmath12 oscillations via the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( large - angle solution ) , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( small - angle solution ) , or with @xmath17 and @xmath14 ( low solution ) @xcite .",
    "although the large - angle msw solution seems to be somehow favored by the present super - kamiokande and sno data @xcite , the other three solutions have not been convincingly ruled out .",
    "to pin down the true solution to the solar neutrino problem remains a challenging task of the next - round solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the strong hierarchy between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , together with the small @xmath20-component in @xmath6 configuration @xcite , implies that atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations decouple approximately from each other .",
    "each of them is dominated by a single mass scale , which can be set as @xmath21 of course @xmath22 holds in this approximation . as a consequence ,",
    "the mixing factors of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the disappearance - type experiments ( i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are simply given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 lepton flavor mixing matrix linking the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath28 to the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath29 .",
    "the present experimental data seem to favor the large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem . in this case , @xmath30 . then two large mixing angles can be drawn from eq .",
    "( 2 ) : one between the 2nd and 3rd lepton families and the other between the 1st and 2nd lepton families . ) had been made by several authors @xcite before the first - round super - kamiokande data appeared in 1998 . ]",
    "a particularly interesting limit is @xmath31 , corresponding uniquely ( up to a trivial sign or phase rearrangement ) to @xmath32 the so - called `` bi - maximal '' flavor mixing pattern @xcite .",
    "there have been a lot of discussions about the bi - maximal and nearly bi - maximal neutrino mixing scenarios @xcite .",
    "while the latter could straightforwardly be obtained from slight modifications of the former , the arbitrariness in doing so has to be resolved by imposing simple flavor symmetries or dynamical constraints on the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , it has been shown that a nearly bi - maximal neutrino mixing pattern can naturally arise from the explicit breaking of the lepton flavor democracy .",
    "the present paper aims to discuss two simple but instructive possibilities to construct the lepton mass matrices , from which two almost bi - maximal neutrino mixing patterns can directly be derived .",
    "we find that these two scenarios have practically indistinguishable consequences on solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , but their predictions for leptonic cp or t violation are quite different . to be specific , we calculate the deviation of solar neutrino mixing from maximal mixing in each scenario .",
    "we illustrate that one of the two lepton mixing patterns may lead to an observable t - violating asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions in the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the implications of our phenomenological models on the neutrinoless double beta decay are also discussed in some detail .",
    "the fact that the masses of three active neutrinos are extremely small is presumably attributed to the majorana feature of the neutrino fields @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the light ( left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 must be symmetric and can be diagonalized by a single unitary transformation : @xmath34 the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath35 is in general non - hermitian , hence the diagonalization of @xmath35 needs a bi - unitary transformation : @xmath36 the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath26 , defined to link the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath28 to the neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath29 , measures the mismatch between the diagonalization of @xmath35 and that of @xmath33 : @xmath37 note that @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) and @xmath39 in eq . ( 5 ) are physical ( positive ) masses of light neutrinos and charged leptons , respectively .    in the flavor basis where @xmath35 is diagonal ( i.e. , @xmath40 being a unity matrix ) , the flavor mixing matrix is simplified to @xmath41 . the bi - maximal neutrino mixing pattern @xmath42 can then be constructed from the product of the euler rotation matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 with special rotation angles @xmath45 : @xmath46 obviously the vanishing of the ( 1,3 ) element in @xmath47 assures an exact decoupling between solar ( @xmath1 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath2 ) neutrino oscillations .",
    "the corresponding neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 turns out to be @xmath48 where @xmath49 a trivial sign or phase rearrangement for @xmath42 may lead to a slightly different form of @xmath33 @xcite , but the relevant physical consequences on neutrino oscillations are essentially unchanged .",
    "if the masses of @xmath50 and @xmath51 neutrinos are nearly degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) , one can arrive at a simpler texture of @xmath33 , in which @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 hold .",
    "we observe that the bi - maximal neutrino mixing pattern will be modified , if @xmath56 deviates somehow from the unity matrix .",
    "this can certainly happen , provided that the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath35 is not diagonal in the flavor basis where the neutrino mass matrix @xmath33 takes the form given in eq .",
    "as @xmath57 describes a product of two special euler rotations in the real ( 2,3 ) and ( 1,2 ) planes , the simplest form of @xmath56 which allows @xmath58 to cover the whole @xmath27 space should be @xmath59 or @xmath60 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) . to incorporate t violation in neutrino oscillations ,",
    "however , the complex rotation matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 should be used @xcite . in this case , we arrive at lepton flavor mixing of the pattern @xmath63 or of the pattern @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and so on .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent two nearly bi - maximal flavor mixing scenarios , if the rotation angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 are small in magnitude ,    as the mixing angle @xmath69 or @xmath70 arises from the diagonalization of @xmath35 , it is expected to be a simple function of the ratios of charged lepton masses .",
    "then the strong mass hierarchy of charged leptons naturally assures the smallness of @xmath69 or @xmath70 , as one can see later on .",
    "indeed the proper texture of @xmath35 which leads to the flavor mixing pattern @xmath67 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 . the mixing angle @xmath69 in @xmath67 is then given by @xmath77 on the other hand , the proper texture of @xmath35 which gives rise to the mixing pattern @xmath68 reads as follows : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath70 in @xmath68 turns out to be @xmath82 taking the hierarchy of charged lepton masses ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) into account , one obtains @xmath84 to a good degree of accuracy .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath85 and @xmath86 with the inputs @xmath87 mev , @xmath88 mev , and @xmath89 gev @xcite .",
    "now let us calculate the mixing factors of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the disappearance - type experiments .",
    "( 2 ) , we arrive straightforwardly at @xmath90 for @xmath67 ; and @xmath91 for @xmath68 . allowing @xmath92 and @xmath93 to take arbitrary values , we find that the magnitude of @xmath71 lies in the following range : @xmath94 where @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "numerically , we obtain @xmath97 for @xmath67 and @xmath98 for @xmath68 .",
    "note that @xmath99 holds in both cases .",
    "therefore the two nearly bi - maximal neutrino mixing patterns are practically indistinguishable in the experiments of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "they may be distinguished from each other with the measurements of @xmath100 and cp or t violation in the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "it is worth mentioning that gonzalez - garcia , pe@xmath101a - garay , nir , and smirnov have recently defined a small real parameter @xmath102 to describe the deviation of solar neutrino mixing from maximal mixing @xcite : @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "this parameter proves very useful for phenomenological studies of the solar neutrino problem @xcite : the probabilities of solar neutrino oscillations depend quadratically on @xmath102 in vacuum , and linearly on @xmath102 if matter effects dominate .",
    "it is then our interest to calculate @xmath102 in the nearly bi - maximal neutrino mixing scenarios under discussion .",
    "we notice that @xmath105 results from eq .",
    "( 24 ) exactly . comparing eq .",
    "( 25 ) with eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) , we obtain @xmath106 for @xmath67 ; and @xmath107 for @xmath68 .",
    "given @xmath92 and @xmath93 of arbitrary values , the allowed region of @xmath108 turns out to be @xmath109 in the scenario of @xmath67 , and @xmath110 in the scenario of @xmath68",
    ". both ranges of @xmath108 are phenomenologically interesting for solar neutrino oscillations , as comprehensively discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "it is generally expected that the t - violating asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions is less sensitive to matter effects than the cp - violating asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath119 transitions @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we concentrate only on t violation in the following . in analogy to eq .",
    "( 30 ) , the matter - corrected t - violating asymmetry can be expressed as @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath127 being the effective neutrino masses in matter .",
    "the relation between @xmath128 and @xmath129 reads @xcite @xmath130 where @xmath131 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta \\tilde{m}^2_{32 } & = & \\frac{1}{3 } \\sqrt{x^2 - 3y } \\left [ 3z - \\sqrt{3 ( 1 - z^2 ) } \\right ] \\ ; , %        ( 33)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath132 \\ ; ,   \\nonumber \\\\ z & = & \\cos \\left [ \\frac{1}{3 } \\arccos   \\frac{2x^3 -9xy - 27 a \\delta m^2_{21 } \\delta m^2_{31 } |v_{e1}|^2 } { 2 \\left ( x^2 - 3y \\right ) ^{3/2 } } \\right ] \\ ; .",

    "assuming the matter density of the earth s crust to be constant , one may get @xmath135 $ ] as a good approximation @xcite .    to illustrate ,",
    "let us calculate @xmath136 and @xmath137 for two scenarios of the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments : @xmath138 km and @xmath139 km .",
    "the former baseline corresponds to a neutrino source at fermilab pointing toward the soudan mine or that at cern toward the gran sasso underground laboratory , and the latter corresponds to a possible high - intensity neutrino beam from the high energy proton accelerator in tokaimura to a detector located in beijing @xcite .",
    "we typically take @xmath140 ( the large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem ) and @xmath141 , as well as @xmath142 based on the almost bi - maximal lepton mixing pattern @xmath67 .",
    "the numerical results of @xmath136 and @xmath137 as functions of the neutrino beam energy @xmath123 are shown in figs . 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "we observe that the magnitude of @xmath128 can significantly be suppressed due to matter effects .",
    "this feature of @xmath128 makes the measurement of leptonic cp- and t - violating asymmetries more difficult in practice .",
    "indeed the t - violating asymmetry @xmath137 is quite small in the chosen range of the neutrino beam energy ( 1 gev @xmath143 20 gev ) , at most at the percent level .",
    "the terrestrial matter effects on @xmath137 are in general insignificant and negligible , except the case of the resonance enhancement at @xmath144 gev for @xmath145 km or at @xmath146 gev for @xmath147 km .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath148 has no way to lead to @xmath149 .",
    "therefore a relatively clean signal of t violation , even measured in the future long - baseline neutrino experiments , does not mean that the fundamental t - violating parameter ( @xmath129 or @xmath92 ) can _ directly _ be determined . to pin down those genuine parameters of flavor mixing and t violation",
    ", we must first of all understand the terrestrial matter effects to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "more reliable knowledge of the earth s matter density profile is unavoidably required for our long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "so far we have only introduced a dirac - type t - violating phase into the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath26 . the latter may in general consist of two additional t - violating phases of the majorana type ;",
    "i.e. , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a diagonal majorana phase matrix .",
    "although @xmath152 and @xmath153 have no effect on cp or t violation in normal neutrino - neutrino and antineutrino - antineutrino oscillations , they are expected to play an important role in the neutrinoless double beta decay , whose effective mass term is given as @xmath154 the current experimental bound is @xmath155 ev , obtained by the heidelberg - moscow collaboration at the @xmath5 confidence level @xcite .",
    "for the two nearly bi - maximal lepton mixing scenarios under discussion , @xmath156 reads as follows : @xmath157 where @xmath158 note that @xmath159 and @xmath160 , therefore @xmath161 is an excellent approximation .",
    "if the spectrum of neutrino masses were known , one would be able to simplify the expression of @xmath162 or @xmath163 and confront it with the present experimental bound .",
    "subsequently let us take four specific but interesting cases of the neutrino mass spectrum for example .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath164 . in this case",
    ", the third term of @xmath162 or @xmath163 is negligible .",
    "we then arrive at @xmath165 if @xmath166 holds , we obtain @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the experimental bound @xmath169 ev is then assured for @xmath170 ev of pattern @xmath171 or for @xmath172 ev of pattern @xmath173 .",
    "if the value of @xmath152 is not close to @xmath174 , one may obtain @xmath175 for both lepton mixing patterns .",
    "such a constraint could provide some information on the majorana phase @xmath152 , provided that the magnitude of @xmath176 were already known .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath177 .",
    "one may easily check that the results of @xmath162 and @xmath163 in this case are essentially the same as those in case ( a ) .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath178 . in this case , we obtain @xmath179 ev",
    ". then @xmath176 and @xmath180 should be of @xmath181 ev or smaller .",
    "note that the contribution of @xmath182 to @xmath156 is always suppressed by @xmath183 or @xmath184 .",
    "therefore the magnitude of @xmath156 is at most of @xmath181 ev for either @xmath171 or @xmath173 , much smaller than the present experimental bound .",
    "\\(d ) @xmath185 .",
    "this `` normal '' neutrino mass hierarchy , which is apparently in conflict with our choices @xmath186 and @xmath187 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , will not be taken into account in this paper . ]",
    "leads to @xmath179 ev as well as @xmath188 ev , where the upper limit of @xmath180 corresponds to the large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem . in this case ,",
    "( 37 ) can be simplified as @xmath189 we see that @xmath190 ev must hold for both nearly bi - maximal lepton mixing patterns .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay itself is certainly not enough to determine the two majorana t - violating phases @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "one may in principle study some other possible lepton - number - nonconserving processes , in which the majorana phases can show up , to get more constraints on @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "however , all such processes are suppressed in magnitude by an extremely small factor compared to normal weak interactions @xcite .",
    "hence it seems practically impossible to measure or constrain @xmath152 and @xmath153 in any experiment other than the one associated with the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "we have discussed two simple possibilities to construct the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , from which two almost bi - maximal neutrino mixing patterns can naturally emerge .",
    "both scenarios are favored by the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data , and are compatible with either the large - angle ( or low ) msw solution or the vacuum oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem . while the two lepton mixing patterns have practically indistinguishable consequences on solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , their predictions for leptonic cp or t violation are different and distinguishable .",
    "only one of them is likely to yield an observable t - violating asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions in the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments . to be specific ,",
    "we have taken two typical baselines ( @xmath145 km and @xmath191 km ) to illustrate the magnitude of t violation and its dependence on the terrestrial matter effects .",
    "the implications of our nearly bi - maximal neutrino mixing scenarios on the neutrinoless double beta decay have also been discussed in some detail .",
    "we expect that a variety of neutrino experiments in the near future could provide crucial tests of the existing lepton mixing models and give useful hints towards the symmetry or dynamics of lepton mass generation .",
