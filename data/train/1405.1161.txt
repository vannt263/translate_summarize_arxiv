    "yb was used to make the first spin - singlet bose - einstein condensate  @xcite , a consequence of it being a two - electron atom .",
    "simultaneous multi - isotope trapping has been performed  @xcite , culminating in photo - association spectroscopy of excited hetero - nuclear ytterbium molecules  @xcite .",
    "multi - species magneto - optical trapping with yb has been demonstrated  @xcite , and recently , quantum degenerate mixtures involving yb have been produced  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cold yb also appears to be a favourable candidate for exploring short - range interactions@xcite , studying artificial abelian and non - abelian gauge potentials  @xcite , and searching for a permanent electric - dipole moment  @xcite .",
    "this short list demonstrates the popularity and versatility of the laser cooled ytterbium atoms .",
    "group ii atoms have a reputation for having higher than expected temperatures in magneto - optical traps@xcite : only infrequently is the doppler cooling temperature limit reached in single - stage cooling@xcite ( where single - stage refers to the use of a single transition ) .",
    "although single - stage cooling with the heavy group ii atoms using the @xmath2  transition does not produce exceptionally low temperatures , the temperature reached at the early stage of cooling is important , since lower temperatures lead to higher transfer rates to proceeding stages ( for example , into a @xmath9   ( mot ) or a far off - resonance optical trap ) . here",
    "we present , what we believe to be , the lowest temperatures produced when magneto - optically trapping ytterbium with the @xmath10 line at 398.9 nm .",
    "a number of previous schemes have been employed in the trapping of neutral yb .",
    "some examples are : ( 1 ) direct loading of a @xmath2   from a effusive source @xcite , ( 2 ) loading into a @xmath9  mot with a zeeman slower using the @xmath2  line  @xcite , and ( 3 ) loading with a zeeman slower and two stage cooling in the mot  @xcite . here",

    "the sub - doppler cooling of @xmath0yb  is notable , since yb has a nuclear spin of @xmath13 and thus the total angular momentum quantum number @xmath14 for the ground state .",
    "therefore , the motion - induced orientational sub - doppler cooling process  @xcite , which requires @xmath15 , can not be present in the @xmath8  light field configuration used here .",
    "we provide further evidence that the sub - doppler temperatures observed arise from the sisyphus cooling mechanism usually ascribed to the lin @xmath16 lin ( or @xmath17 ) light field configuration  @xcite .",
    "this is deduced from the knowledge that a 3-dimensional arrangement of @xmath8   beams can produce sisyphus type polarisation gradients  @xcite .",
    "the vacuum system for the cooling and trapping of yb comprises an effusion cell , a zeeman slower section , the main trapping chamber and vacuum pumps .",

    "the former is located near the entrance to the zeeman slower and the latter , 30 cm beyond the centre of the main chamber ( in the direction of the atom flow ) .",
    "the yb atom source is a custom made effusion cell ( createc , gmbh ) designed from suitable components that do not bind or alloy with yb ; for example , most of the crucible is made from tantalum , while the nozzle is composed of 1 mm diameter , 20 mm long stainless steel tubes .",

    "optics , such as quarter wave plates and mirrors , are attached directly to the ti chamber .",
    "we use free space coupling of light through the mot chamber ; though the design of the ti chamber ensures a high degree of orthogonality between the mot arms .",
    "the magneto - optical trap is fed with a 28 cm long zeeman slower based on a two - stage tapered coil with a zero crossing magnetic field  @xcite and a circularly polarised laser beam tuned -7@xmath28 from the @xmath2  transition centre ( @xmath28 is the natural linewidth of @xmath29rads@xmath26 ) .",

    "viewports shortly after the exit of the effusion cell provides access for laser locking to the @xmath2  transition of the atom beam .",
    "line broadening from the velocity spread is minimised by having the probe beams at right angles to the atomic beam ( the linewidth is approximately 77mhz indicating an atomic beam divergence of @xmath460mrad  @xcite ) .",
