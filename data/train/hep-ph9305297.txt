    "over the last few years there has been an enormous interest in the so called heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite .",
    "hadrons made out of a heavy quark , such as @xmath0 or @xmath1 , and either a light anti - quark ( heavy - light meson ) or two light quarks ( heavy - light baryons ) can be conveniently analyzed within the framework of the hqet .",
    "it exploits two symmetries which are not apparent in the standard qcd lagrangian when quark masses are small ( @xmath2 ) : the _ spin _ and _ flavour _ symmetries .",
    "they come down to the statement that the dynamics of a heavy - light hadron is heavy - flavour and heavy - quark spin independent .",
    "these two symmetries can be combined into a larger one : the _ isgur - wise _ symmetry  .",
    "the phenomenological implications of the isgur - wise symmetry have been extensively discussed in the recent literature  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we address the field theoretical questions of whether the hqet is renormalizable or not and whether renormalization can be accomplished or not while preserving brs invariance . in applications of the hqet ,",
    "renormalizability is always assumed and even some renormalization constants have been computed under this assumption . however , as far as we know , a formal proof is still missing .",
    "these are not just academic questions since loop calculations are required in order to obtain the scaling ( or large heavy - quark mass behaviour ) of many phenomenologically relevant quantities , e.g. leptonic and semileptonic decay constants and form factors .",
    "although the asymptotic behaviour of these and other parameters could in principle be obtained from standard qcd  @xcite , the calculations are far more involved than the corresponding ones in the hqet and , to the best of our knowledge , no attempt has been made beyond one loop .",
    "this raises another important question : does the hqet really provide the right ( qcd based ) large quark mass result beyond tree - level ?",
    "we come back to this point below .",
    "our first goal is to prove that the hqet is renormalizable perturbatively to any order .",
    "what has to be shown is that it is possible to rescale the fields and coupling constants so that all green functions involving only elementary fields are free of ultraviolet divergences without spoiling brs invariance .",
    "( in fact , we would only need a proof for s - matrix amplitudes",
    ". however , these will be finite if green functions have no divergences . )",
    "thus , we choose a regularization scheme which preserves brs invariance , e.g. dimensional regularization .    throughout this letter",
    "we will assume that weinberg s convergence theorem  @xcite is satisfied even though lorentz invariance is broken by the heavy quark propagator , @xmath3 .",
    "more explicitly , we will assume that if a 1pi graph @xmath4 has superficial degree of divergence @xmath5 , given by naive power counting , then its overall uv divergence is a polynomial in the external momentum of at most degree @xmath5 .",
    "we shall not attempt to prove this statement here , but rather note that the heavy quark propagator @xmath3 is very similar to the principal - value prescribed pole @xmath6 of axial gauges for which one can argue that weinberg s theorem holds  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a large variety of one- and two - loop calculations  @xcite give support to this assumption .    our second goal is to show that there exist renormalization schemes in both qcd and the hqet consistent with brs invariance and such that any qcd green function agrees with its hqet counterpart up to order @xmath7 . we shall refer to this as the _ matching_. for instance , for the quark propagator one has ||_mv+p",
    "= h^_v |h^_v    field ( mass ) of a heavy quark , i.e.  @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the effective field in the hqet corresponding to the particle ( antiparticle ) part of @xmath11 . in this letter",
    "we use the shorthand notation @xmath12 . note that on the hqet side of equations such as  ( [ e1-a ] ) , the momentum , @xmath13 , of a heavy quark ( antiquark ) with velocity @xmath14 is actually its virtuality or `` off - shellness '' , defined by subtracting @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) from the real momentum used on the qcd side . assuming renormalizability of the hqet , grinstein  @xcite has shown that qcd and hqet green functions match provided one chooses the appropriate counterterms , which turn out to depend logarithmically on @xmath17 . unfortunately , it is not clear if his approach preserves brs invariance .",
    "we shall prove the following statement : by choosing our renormalization scheme in such a way that the heavy quark two - point functions in qcd and in the hqet agree up to order @xmath7 , brs invariance ensures also the matching of the heavy quark - gluon vertex and , in turn , of any other green function .",
    "hence , our approach explicitly preserves the brs invariance of the theory .    in applications ,",
    "one usually works in the  ( or ms ) scheme . from the preceding paragraph",
    "it follows that there must exist a coefficient @xmath18 such that , for example , @xmath19 .",
    "similar equations hold for any pair of green functions .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 is just the _ finite _ wave function renormalization constant of the heavy quark that relates the  scheme with the above - mentioned ones .",
    "it is important because it provides the scaling properties of the qcd green functions at large @xmath17 .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec1b ] we introduce the hqet lagrangian and discuss the brs symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly review the proof of renormalizability of qcd .",
    "we will follow very closely the proof given by collins @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we will show that the hqet is renormalizable . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we prove that matching of qcd and the hqet can be achieved while maintaining brs invariance .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] will be devoted to comments and conclusions .",
    "in terms of renormalized fields the lagrangian of the hqet , @xmath21 , has the form : = + , [ e - a ] where & = & |h^+_v(x ) i vd h^+_v(x)- |h^-_v(x ) i vd h^-_v(x);[e - b ] + & = & -14 ( g_^a)^2 + |(i -m_0)-12(a^a)^2 + _ |c^a d^c^a .",
    "[ e - c ] for simplicity , only one heavy and one light quark flavour will be considered . here ,",
    "g_^a=_a_^a - _ a_^a -x g c_abca_^b a_^c [ e - d ] is the ( gluon ) field - strength tensor .",
    "the covariant derivatives in the defining and adjoint representations of @xmath22 are respectively : d_&=&(_+igx t^a",
    "a_^a ) ; = , h^_v ; [ e - e ] + d_c_a&=&_c^a + xg c_abcc^b a_^c .",
    "[ e - f ] in eqs.([e - b]-[e - f ] ) , @xmath23 is the coupling constant , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the wave function renormalization constants of the @xmath28 ( gluon ) , @xmath29 ( ghost ) , @xmath30 ( light quark ) and @xmath31 ( effective heavy quark / antiquark ) fields , whereas @xmath32 renormalizes the ghost - gluon vertex .",
    "finally , @xmath33 is the bare ( light ) quark mass , @xmath34 are the generators of @xmath22 in its defining representation satisfying @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the structure constants defined through @xmath37= ic_{abc}t^c$ ] .    the global symmetries of @xmath21 , particularly the isgur - wise symmetry , have been discussed ( see for instance  @xcite ) and exploited extensively in the literature .",
    "it has also been shown from different approaches  @xcite that _ at tree - level _ the lagrangian @xmath21 can be obtained from the full qcd lagrangian @xmath38 , where = |(i -m_0)[e-_g ] describes an ordinary quark field @xmath11 with mass @xmath39 coupled to gluons through the covariant derivative @xmath40 defined as in  ( [ e - e ] ) . in the  scheme one has @xmath41 , however , if a mass dependent scheme is chosen , as we shall do to prove the matching in section  [ sec4 ] , two independent wave function renormalization constants are required .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ e - a ] ) is invariant under the ( renormalized ) brs transformations@xmath42 where @xmath43 is any basic field , @xmath44 is a grassmann number and @xmath45 is given by : @xmath46 the full qcd lagrangian @xmath47 is also invariant under  ( [ e - g]-[e - j ] ) and @xmath11 transforming as @xmath30 .",
    "this well - known result will be used in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "our goal is to prove that a clever choice of @xmath24 , @xmath48 , @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 suffices to render all green functions of elementary fields , as well as the composite operators in  ( [ e - g][e - k ] ) , and  ( [ e2-a ] ) below , ultraviolet finite .",
    "the proof of renormalizability that we sketch out in this section requires that the regulated green functions satisfy the ward identities implied by brs invariance .",
    "as already pointed out in the introduction , this is ensured by using dimensional regularisation ( or another regulator that does not break brs invariance ) .",
    "renormalizability of the standard qcd ( light quark ) sector of the hqet with lagrangian @xmath49 is proved by induction on the number of loops , @xmath50 .",
    "the assumptions are the following :    1 .",
    "all 1pi green functions of elementary fields as well as those with an insertion of the composite operators appearing in the brs transformations  ( [ e - g][e - j ] ) have successfully been made uv - finite at each order below @xmath50 loops .",
    "this has been achieved by choosing the renormalization constants @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 , @xmath32 and the bare mass @xmath33 appropriately .",
    "2 .   as above for green functions with insertions of the operator b_^a(x)=(x-1)1 g _",
    "|c(x)^a + c_abc |c^b ( x ) a_^c(x ) .",
    "[ e2-a ] this operator will be used to prove that @xmath51 ( and @xmath52 , in section  [ sec3 ] ) , and the quark - gluon vertex are uv - finite .    obviously  1 and  2 hold at tree level .",
    "it must be shown that they also hold at order  @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we proceed to compute @xmath50 loop contributions .",
    "since subdivergences have already been subtracted , only green functions having non - negative superficial degree of divergence , @xmath53 , may have an overall uv - divergence .",
    "these ( potentially ) uv - divergent green functions are the quark , ghost and gluon self - energies ; the ghost - gluon vertex ; the gluon three- and four - point functions ; some ( 1pi ) insertions of the operators @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath51 ; and , finally , the quark - gluon vertex . because of weinberg s theorem , their overall divergences are polynomials in the external momenta of degree @xmath57 .",
    "hence , they may eventually be absorbed in the counterterm lagrangian implied by  ( [ e - c ] ) and the renormalization constants in  ( [ e - g][e - j ] , [ e2-a ] ) .",
    "next , * i * ) we choose @xmath26 and @xmath33 to cancel the uv divergences of the quark two - point function ; * ii * ) we choose @xmath24 to render the gluon self energy finite ( a brs identity must be used to check that uv - divergences do not show up in the longitudinal piece ) ; *",
    "iii * ) @xmath58 is chosen to cancel the part of the divergence of the ghost self - energy and * iv * ) @xmath32 is chosen to make the ghost - gluon vertex finite ( note that only the colour tensor structure @xmath59 is allowed by charge conjugation ) . at this point ,",
    "all renormalization constants have been fixed and one must check that the uv - divergences of the remaining green functions automatically cancel against the relevant contributions of the renormalization constants we have just determined . this is accomplished through the use of brs identities .",
    "one proceeds orderly ( for each step requires the conclusions of the preceding ones ) as follows : * v * ) check that the operator @xmath54 is finite ; * vi * ) using ( v ) and some brs identity , check finiteness of the gluon three- and four - point functions ; * vii * ) show that no uv - divergence arises in insertions of @xmath55 ; * viii * ) as above for @xmath56 ; * ix * ) as above for @xmath51 .",
    "finally , use ( i , ix ) and some identities to prove that * x * ) the quark - gluon vertex is also uv - finite .",
    "this completes the proof of renormalizability .",
    "( for details , see ref.@xcite . )",
    "now , we turn to the hqet .",
    "an important simplification arises from the observation that loops of only heavy quark propagators never occur .",
    "this is due to the fact that in @xmath21 heavy quarks , @xmath9 , @xmath60 , do not couple to heavy antiquarks , @xmath10 , @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , the renormalization of green functions with no external effective heavy quark legs ( entirely described by @xmath49 ) remains as in ordinary qcd .",
    "note that this statement shows that steps ( i  x ) of the previous section can be carried out exactly as for the lagrangian  ( [ e - c ] ) if no green function with external heavy quark fields is considered . among those green functions involving @xmath31",
    "there are only four superficially divergent : the quark two - point function , @xmath62 ; the quark - gluon vertex , @xmath63 , as well as @xmath64 and @xmath65 . to the induction assumptions of section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", one has to append the finiteness of these green functions at each order below @xmath50 loops .",
    "one has also to add to the previous list of steps the following : * i * ) choose @xmath27 to cancel the uv - divergences in the heavy - quark two - point function ; * ix * ) using the appropriate identities , check that the operators @xmath52 and @xmath66 are finite ; finally , * x * ) show that no uv - divergence appears in the ( heavy ) quark - gluon vertex .",
    "this , we carry out in this section .",
    "let us begin considering @xmath67 in momentum space .",
    "weinberg s theorem tells us that the renormalization prescription can be chosen so that the overall divergence of the 1pi portion of @xmath67 is a polynomial in the external residual momenta or `` off - shellness '' _ and _ the light quark mass of degree @xmath57 .",
    "for such a renormalization prescription , the overall divergence can only be proportional to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 being the residual external momentum and @xmath71 the mass of the light quark propagating in the loops . obviously , we can get rid of the divergence proportional to @xmath72 by adjusting @xmath48 . however , there is no counterterm in @xmath73 to cancel a divergence proportional to the light quark mass .",
    "thus , we must show that this divergence is absent .",
    "this is easily seen by noting that the @xmath71 dependence of @xmath67 comes only from light quark loops .",
    "the corresponding traces of @xmath74-matrices are seen to be an even function of @xmath71 and , hence , no uv divergence proportional to @xmath71 can arise .",
    "this completes step  ( i ) .",
    "now we turn to  ( ix ) .",
    "there is only one 1pi diagram with an insertion of @xmath52 in which uv - divergences can occur : _r h^_v(x ) |h^_v(0 ) |c^c(y)^1pi .",
    "[ e3-a ] to prove that  ( [ e3-a ] ) is actually uv - finite , we consider @xmath75",
    ". clearly , uv - finiteness of this green function ensures uv - finiteness of  ( [ e3-a ] ) .",
    "one can show that _r h^_v(x ) |h^_v(y ) |c^a(z)&= & -1x_r h^_v ( x ) |h^_v ( y ) sc^a(z ) + & - & 12g_r h^_v ( x ) _ r |h^_v(y ) c_ade|c^d(z)|c^e(z)[e3-b ] + & -&g_r h^_v ( x ) |h^_v ( y ) ^b_^a(z ) , where @xmath76 is the complete action , @xmath77 . in order to obtain  ( [ e3-b ] )",
    "we have computed @xmath78 from  ( [ e2-a ] ) .",
    "next , by  ( [ e - j ] ) we have written @xmath79 as @xmath80 .",
    "finally , we have used the nilpotence property @xmath81=0 $ ] and the identity @xmath82 to  integrate by parts \" @xmath83 into its final form in  ( [ e3-b ] ) .",
    "each of the three terms of  ( [ e3-b ] ) is now shown to be finite : 1 ) using the anti - ghost equation of motion  @xcite , one can easily show that @xmath84 since the heavy quark two - point function is uv - finite by  ( i ) , so is the first term of  ( [ e3-b ] ) .",
    "2 ) the superficial degree of divergence of the second green function of  ( [ e3-b ] ) is @xmath85 .",
    "it is finite because it is 1pi and subdivergences have already been canceled according to the induction assumptions .",
    "3 ) finally , we must consider the last term of  ( [ e3-b ] ) , whose decomposition in 1pi parts is shown in figure  1 .",
    "for simplicity we have amputated the external quark leg , which has previously seen to be uv - finite .",
    "graph  ( c ) has @xmath86 , so it is finite .",
    "adding graphs  ( a ) and  ( b ) one obtains + ( b)=_r h^_v |h^_v |c^b ^(n-1)_1pi c^b ^b^a_^(n ) , [ e3-b _ _ ] where the superscript @xmath87 indicates that contributions up to @xmath88 loops are included .",
    "note that the @xmath50-loop contribution from @xmath89 does not appear in  ( [ e3-b _ _ ] ) because no zeroth order graph of @xmath90 exists .",
    "the first factor in  ( [ e3-b _ _ ] ) is finite by the induction assumption , while the second factor is also finite by step  ( viii ) .",
    "this completes step  ( ix ) .",
    "finiteness of @xmath66 can be proved by the same method .",
    "step  ( x ) is an immediate consequence of  ( ix ) and the identity @xmath91 , which can be written as h^_v |h^_v ^a^a_=h^_v _ r |h^_v |c^a- _r h^_v |h^_v |c^a .",
    "[ e3-c ] this ward identity shows that the contraction of the heavy quark gluon vertex ( 1pi , after subtraction of the uv - finite external propagators ) with the momentum of the gluon leg has no uv divergence . since by power",
    "counting the divergence of the vertex can only be proportional to @xmath92 , the vertex itself is finite .",
    "this completes the proof of renormalizability of the hqet .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the hqet is renormalizable .",
    "as already mentioned , this is precisely the main assumption used by grinstein in  @xcite to show that the green functions of @xmath21 and those of @xmath38 match for large @xmath17 .",
    "again , the proof in  @xcite ( and also here ) is by induction on @xmath50 .",
    "it is assumed that matching holds at each order below @xmath50 loops for any green function of the type considered in the induction assumptions  1 and  2 of section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "note that at tree - level any green function matches by construction  @xcite . then , as shown in  @xcite , the matching at order @xmath50 holds for graphs with negative superficial degree of divergence .",
    "thus , we need only be concerned with the matching of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "let us begin by borrowing from  @xcite the following result : it is always possible to modify the counterterm in @xmath97 , @xmath27 and @xmath98 by an uv - finite amount in such a way that the quark two - point functions match , i.e , eq .  ( [ e1-a ] ) is satisfied , at @xmath50 loops .",
    "one can check that the readjusted renormalization constants and @xmath98 become functions of @xmath99 .",
    "if brs invariance is to be preserved , one can not change the value of the remaining counterterm in  ( [ e-_g ] ) ( see also  eq .",
    "( [ e - e ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , we must show that the qcd and qhet quark - gluon vertexes match automatically .",
    "first , we shall check that _r | |c^a|_mv+p -_r h^_v |h^_v    ( [ e3-b _ ] ) and  ( [ e3-b _ _ ] ) by the replacement @xmath100 also hold , we only need to prove the matching of the green functions on the right hand side of  ( [ e3-b ] ) with their @xmath11  counterparts ( in momentum space ) .",
    "the matching of @xmath101 and @xmath102 is guaranteed by the matching of the quark two - point functions  ( [ e1-a ] ) and by the @xmath11- and @xmath103-version of  ( [ e3-b _ ] ) , which in momentum space read -1x_r | = g t^a |,=h^_v , . the matching of @xmath104 and @xmath105 holds because both have negative superficial degree of divergence .",
    "finally , we must prove that @xmath106 and @xmath107 also match .",
    "this is apparent from figure  1 since graphs of the type  ( c ) have @xmath86 , whereas from  ( [ e3-b _ _ ] ) , graphs  ( a ) and  ( b ) are seen to involve @xmath89 and @xmath108 at @xmath109 loops _ at most _ , so they match by the induction assumption .",
    "it is important to recall that the external quark legs have been amputated in figure  1 .",
    "this causes no trouble , for the quark propagators are already known to match .",
    "similarly , one can show that the matching of the terms involving @xmath110 and @xmath66 also holds .",
    "we now turn to the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "one can show  @xcite that |a^a_|_mv+p- h^_v|h^_v a^a_|_p= t^a ^v_+o(1 m ) .",
    "[ e4-c ] where @xmath111 is the effective heavy quark propagator and the coefficient @xmath112 is uv - finite , dimensionless and dependent only on @xmath99 . for simplicity",
    "we have amputated the gluon leg in  ( [ e4-c ] ) .",
    "it must be shown that @xmath112 vanishes .",
    "this is easily seen from  ( [ e3-c ] ) , the ward identity |^a^a_=_r | |c^a- _r | |c^a[e4-d ] and the matching of the green functions on their right hand sides .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we have shown that the hqet is renormalizable perturbatively .",
    "weinberg s theorem and brs invariance play an essential role in the proof .",
    "weinberg s theorem is assumed to hold for the hqet , as several one- and two - loop calculations seem to indicate , while brs invariance is explicitly preserved at any order in perturbation theory .",
    "we have also shown that the hqet provides the infinite mass limit of qcd for heavy quarks near mass - shell .",
    "again , brs invariance is crucial in our proof .",
    "if the  scheme is chosen , qcd and the hqet match in the following sense : @xmath113 , where the dots stand for any string of ( light ) fields and @xmath20 is a _ uv - finite _ wave function renormalization constant of the heavy quark fields .",
