    "while the hunt for physics beyond the standard model at the high - energy frontier continues at the lhc or in dark matter experiments  with disappointing results so far ",
    ", new physics may still have a few surprises in store in the low - mass region .",
    "axion - phenomenology is a classical example of such effects in the limit of light less - than - weakly - coupled particles . in the following , we consider another case of comparatively light state occurring in the context of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , a well - motivated extension of the standard model ( sm ) .    in the nmssm ,",
    "the cp - odd higgs sector ( ignoring the goldstone boson ) consists of two degrees of freedom  a doublet component @xmath3 , comparable to the mssm pseudoscalar , and a singlet state @xmath4 . both mix at tree - level according to the following mass - matrix : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters from the superpotential , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , parameters from the soft supersymmetry - breaking lagrangian , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , doublet and singlet vacuum expectation values or related quantities . here , we have been considering the @xmath13-conserving nmssm explicitly",
    ". however , @xmath13-violating terms as well as radiative corrections can be incorporated in this picture with limited effort .",
    "the states @xmath14 are ordered in mass : @xmath15 .",
    "a light state is regarded as natural ",
    "i.e.  as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson  in two specific limits of the nmssm parameter space :    * for @xmath16 , the higgs potential is approximately invariant under a @xmath17 peccei - quinn symmetry . in this case , the doublet component of @xmath0  through which this particle couples to sm matter  is given by @xmath18 .",
    "* for @xmath19 , another approximate @xmath17 symmetry appears , which can be related to the r - symmetry . in this case ,",
    "@xmath20 .",
    "however , the light pseudoscalar may also result from an ` accidental ' arrangement of the nmssm parameters .    while a mssm pseudoscalar might still be comparatively light @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite for a discussion in the context of the nmssm ) , the hypothesis of a dominantly doublet light cp - odd higgs  already constrained ( at least indirectly ) by lep @xcite  is under increasing pressure from lhc searches @xcite or flavour transitions , due to the correlation of doublet masses  implying that there exist a light cp - even and a comparatively light pair of charged higgs states as well , all phenomenologically more conspicuous at colliders .",
    "still , the situation is different for a singlet or a mixed pseudoscalar @xmath0 , since the mentioned correlation dissipates and the light cp - odd higgs becomes largely independent from the rest of the higgs sector . from the perspective of lep ( or @xmath21-colliders in general ) , the direct production of a cp - odd higgs proves difficult as the tree - level couplings to electroweak gauge - bosons vanish .",
    "the possibility of a light cp - odd nmssm state  with mass @xmath22  gev  thus appeared in the pre - lhc era as a phenomenologically appealing and realistic scenario : see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , limits from low - energy observables , e.g.  flavour transitions @xcite or bottomonium decays and spectroscopy @xcite , apply in this low - mass region and constrain , in particular , the coupling of @xmath0 to down - type fermions . with the start of the lhc",
    ", several direct or indirect production modes of the light cp - odd higgs have been considered @xcite . yet , the higgs discovery at the lhc @xcite considerably reduces the scope of the phenomenology associated to a light @xmath0 : when kinematically allowed , the higgs - to - higgs decay @xmath23\\to2a_1 $ ]  with @xmath23 $ ] denoting the observed state at @xmath24  gev  could naively dominate the standard decay channels , which would have implied suppressed rates of @xmath23 $ ] in the run - i ( and run - ii ) .",
    "as the observed higgs characteristics demonstrate the success of the standard search channels , the @xmath23\\to2a_1 $ ] decay width must therefore be small .",
    "this can be realized  in certain limits or due to accidental cancellations  and , in this extent , a light nmssm @xmath0 may coexist with a cp - even state at @xmath24  gev that retains roughly sm - like characteristics  hence a suitable candidate for @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "such a scenario thus remains phenomenologically viable .",
    "nevertheless , the condition of a suppressed @xmath23\\to2a_1 $ ] induces constraints on the nmssm parameter space , which have been discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "additionally , atlas and cms have searched explicitly for @xmath23\\to2a_1 $ ] with final states including leptons @xcite .    beyond its consequences for the higgs sector , the hypothetical existence of a light nmssm pseudoscalar may lead to other phenomenologically interesting effects . in the context of singlino dark matter @xcite , the light-@xmath0 funnel",
    "may ensure a sufficiently large annihilation cross - section , yielding the correct relic density @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the light cp - odd higgs scenario retains a clear motivation .",
    "another application @xcite would address the @xmath25  mev excess in @xmath26 transitions @xcite .    despite the interest that the light cp - odd higgs scenario has raised in the literature , a relative shadow continues to veil our knowledge of the decays of this particle in the very low mass range @xmath27 .",
    "there , the partonic description , summarized in e.g.  @xcite , predicts largely dominant strongly - interacting final states , such as @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "this picture has been sensibly criticized by @xcite : close to the confinement scale , the partonic approach is no longer reliable and @xcite recommends an effective description of the hadronic decays based on the perturbative spectator model . among the consequences of the latter choice , @xmath30  gev becomes the lower limit where hadronic final states are relevant . moreover",
    ", hadronic channels then seem largely superseeded by the @xmath31 width .",
    "still , this description in @xcite misses at least one effect that can substantially affect the decays : the cp - odd higgs shares its quantum numbers with ( some of ) the mesons , which induces a mixing among these states .",
    "in other words , the light cp - odd higgs acquires a mesonic component  via its interaction with quarks  and the latter may well dominate the decays of this particle . in this sense",
    ", the impact of hadronic physics extends below the tri - pion threshold , at least down to @xmath32 .",
    "this mixing effect has already been noted in the context of heavy quarkonia @xcite and its impact on @xmath0-decays at the @xmath33-threshold was highlighted in @xcite . in the very low - mass range , @xcite suggested that the hadronic decays of @xmath0 may resemble those of the meson that is closest in mass , while @xcite estimated the mixing with the mesons in the formalism of partially - conserved axial currents ( pcac ) .",
    "as a consequence of this confused situation for the pseudoscalar decays , the phenomenology of this particle at low - mass remains largely speculative and the interplay of constraints can not be consistently applied .    in this paper , we aim at shedding some light into this question and propose an estimate of the nmssm pseudoscalar decays in the @xmath2  gev range .",
    "due to the intrinsic difficulty of a quantitative description of hadronic phenomena and the corresponding large uncertainties , this evaluation has no ambition beyond that of providing an educated guess for the @xmath0 decay widths and branching fractions and , while the derived picture may seem more reliable than the partonic approach , we should not dismiss the possibility of sizable deviations . in the following section",
    ", we shall summarize the formalism describing the interactions of a light cp - odd higgs with the mesons , relevant at masses below @xmath34  gev .",
    "then , we will derive the @xmath0 decays in this mass range .",
    "finally , we will attempt to extrapolate the hadronic decays of the pseudoscalar up to the @xmath35 threshold using the perturbative spectator approach , before coming to a short conclusion .    as a final word before starting with the actual description of the pseudoscalar interactions at low mass",
    ", we stress that our results apply beyond the nmssm , in any singlet or doublet extension of the sm containing a light pseudoscalar higgs state : all that is necessary in order to extend our discussion to such cases amounts to replacing the explicit nmssm couplings to quarks , photons and gluons by their analogues in the corresponding model .",
    "the purpose of this section consists in summarizing the formalism leading to the inclusion of a light pseudoscalar in the non - linear sigma model for the mesons .",
    "we consider a nmssm cp - odd higgs with mass below the @xmath35 threshold .",
    "the other relevant fields at low - energy include the up , down and strange quarks , the muon and electron , as well as the photon and gluons .",
    "the interactions of the pseudoscalar with these fields may be summarized in the following effective lagrangian : @xmath36 here , we have confined to the operators of lowest - dimension for the @xmath0-interactions with each type of field : dimension @xmath37 for the fermions and dimension @xmath38 for the gauge bosons .",

    "we have shown how the interactions of a light nmssm higgs pseudoscalar with the hadronic sector could be described by a chiral lagrangian .",
    "a remarkable effect , which , to our knowledge , has not received much attention before , appears in the form of a mixing of the cp - odd higgs with the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "this mixing has little effect on the mesons themselves , since they have large hadronic or anomaly - driven decays . on the other hand",
    ", its impact on the naturally narrow ( singlet - dominated ) @xmath0 can be very important .",
    "in particular , the photonic and hadronic decay widths are sizably affected .",
    "however , the leptonic final state remains the dominant decay channel of the higgs state in most of the considered mass - range . as the mesons do not possess large decays into leptons",
    ", it is possible to place limits on the leptonic width that they acquire via mixing .",
    "the chiral lagrangian also provides quartic @xmath0-meson interaction terms .",
    "these govern the tri - meson decays of the pure - higgs component . beyond @xmath303  gev ,",
    "it is possible to extend the description of the higgs - interactions with the strong - interacting sector using the spectator approach .",
    "our results can be criticized in many ways . in particular ,",
    "sizable higher order corrections are known to modify the chiral couplings of the mesons , so that it seems questionable to rely on the tree - level chiral vertices for the higgs state .",
    "a more comprehensive approach , using higher - dimensional chiral operators as well as loop effects , has proved ( partially ) successful in describing the hadronic decays of the @xmath149 and @xmath150 and the same type of exercise could probably be adapted with profit to the case of the light cp - odd higgs , increasing the reliability of the computed widths . yet ,",
    "such a calculation is far beyond the ambitions of this paper where our scope is limited to a qualitative investigation of the relevant effects .",
    "consequently , even though the picture that we propose is somewhat more convincing than a pure partonic , quark - perturbative approach , we should remain aware that large corrections ( of order @xmath318 ) could modify the actual magnitude of the hadronic decays .",
    "deficient they are , our estimates of the pseudoscalar higgs widths can be applied to constrain the rich phenomenology of this particle .",
    "in particular , limits from flavour - physics , quarkonium decays or beam - dump experiment should be considered in this new light .",
    "still , an additional decay channel should be considered in the presence of a very - light dark matter candidate .",
    "a fortran implementation of the @xmath0-decays in the low - mass region is in preparation at the request of ` nmssmtools ` @xcite .",
    "finally , we remind that the effects that we have described here in the explicit case of the nmssm could be easily transposed to other models including a light cp - odd state .",

    "<S> a popular regime in the nmssm parameter space involves a light cp - odd higgs @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario has consequences for e.g.  light singlino dark matter annihilating in the @xmath0-funnel . in order to confront the pseudoscalar to experimental limits such as flavour observables </S>",
    "<S> , upsilon decays or beam - dump experiments , it is necessary to control the interactions of this particle with hadronic matter and derive the corresponding decays . the partonic description can not be relied upon for masses close to @xmath1  gev and we employ a chiral lagrangian , then extended to a spectator model for somewhat larger masses , to describe the interplay of the cp - odd higgs with hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a mixing can develop between @xmath0 and neutral pseudoscalar mesons , leading to substantial hadronic decays and a coupling of @xmath0 to the chiral anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , quartic @xmath0-meson couplings induce tri - meson decays of the higgs pseudoscalar . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate these effects and propose an estimate of the higgs widths for masses below @xmath2  gev . </S>",
    "<S> while we focus on the case of the nmssm , our results are applicable to a large class of models . </S>"
