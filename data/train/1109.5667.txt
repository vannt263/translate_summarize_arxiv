    "parity - violating nucleon - nucleon interactions cause the spin of transversely polarized neutrons to undergo a rotation when traveling through a target medium , even in the absence of magnetic fields . in this paper",

    "recently , an upper bound on the effect in helium-4 was obtained at nist  @xcite .    at present ,",
    "the effects of hadronic parity violation on the nuclear level can not be predicted from first principles .",

    "in particular , since typical neutron energies in parity - violating spin - rotation experiments on the lightest nuclei are low enough that pion exchange can not be resolved , we use the pionless eft with only nucleons as dynamical degrees of freedom .",

    "when traversing a medium , each helicity state evolves with a phase factor : @xmath30 as long as @xmath31 , which is the case for parity - conserving interactions , the polarization of the beam is unchanged ; the state simply picks up an overall phase factor . in the case of parity violation , however , @xmath32 and the neutron spin is rotated by an amount @xmath33 a positive value of the spin rotation angle @xmath34 corresponds to a rotation about the neutron momentum in the sense of a right - handed screw . using eq .  , the spin rotation angle per unit length @xmath15 is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the scattering amplitude for @xmath37-helicity neutrons including the statistical mixture of available target spins . for further details",
