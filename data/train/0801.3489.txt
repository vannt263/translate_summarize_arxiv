    "innovative channel geometries have been empirically designed to focus randomly ordered inertial particles in microchannels @xcite .",
    "these phenomena and related applications rely on the non - trivial dynamics of inertial particles in a fluid . in this paper , we demonstrate a theoretical tool to achieve particle segregation , by studying the sensitivity of the dynamics of inertial particles in a fluid .    we employ a simplified form of the maxey - riley equation @xcite as the governing equation for the motion of inertial particles in a fluid .",

    "we obtain a sensitivity field akin to a ftle field but restricted to the relative velocity subspace and demonstrate numerically that the ridges in this field act as separatrices .",

    "domains of instability exist in which particle trajectories diverge @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov characteristic exponent is widely used to quantify the sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent is a good indicator of chaotic behavior .",

    "however , because the system is dissipative and the global attractor is the @xmath53 subspace , we can obtain meaningful information by restricting the computations to a lower dimensional subdomain of the phase space .",

    "in this way the sensitivity of the final spatial location of the particles to initial relative velocity can be computed .      as equation(15 )",

    "this can be overcome by sampling multiple perturbations in the different directions . a reference point and its neighbors",
    "are identified and after a finite time their positions in configuration space are computed .",

    "the ridges in the maximal sensitivity field @xmath60 , partition the relative velocity subspace .",
    "we applied the above procedure to a cellular flow .",
    "+ _ a note on the terminology _ - the field measuring the sensitivity of the final location of particles in configuration space with respect to perturbations in initial relative velocity is analogous to the ftle field , but not identical . to obtain the true ftle field ,",
    "one would have to compute the @xmath62 state transition matrix , @xmath63 . using the notation of eq ,    @xmath64    the ftle field",
    "is then given by @xmath65 .",
    "ridges in this field are 3 dimensional structures and represent the true lcs .",
    "this flow is described by the stream function @xmath66 the velocity field is given by ,    @xmath67    @xmath68    there are heteroclinic connections from the stable and unstable manifolds of the fixed points",
    "@xmath69 , shown by the arrows in figure [ streamlines ] , which are also the boundaries of the cells .",
    "these coincide with lcs@xmath70 , the lcs for the fluid velocity field .",
    "the lcs@xmath70 is to be distinguished from the lcs of the inertial particle in the full four dimensional phase space . by choosing initial perturbations of the form given by eq .   at different points along a streamline",
    ", we follow how these perturbations grow in the @xmath53 plane by integrating the particle trajectories numerically from which the sensitivity field is computed .",
    "figure [ variation of ftle ] shows the sensitivity field computed for initial perturbations in the relative velocity subspace , at different points on the streamline @xmath71 .",
    "the ridges in this field have high values of sensitivity .",
    "it can be seen that there is a continuous variation in the ridges of the sensitivity field with respect to the initial @xmath72 coordinates . in each case",
    "the sensitivity field at a given point depends on the underlying lcs@xmath70 of the fluid flow .",
    "the ridges in the sensitivity field have meaningful information about the dynamics of inertial particles even when computed at points far from the saddle points of the fluid flow .",
    "this is shown in figure [ velocity_partition](a ) which is the sensitivity field computed at @xmath73 .",
    "the ridges in the sensitivity field partition the relative velocity subspace according to the final location of particles . in figure [ velocity_partition](b ) the ridges in the partial ftle field are used to identify regions in the relative velocity subspace , that produce qualitatively different trajectories .",
    "particles that start at the same physical location , but are in different regions of the relative velocity subspace , are neatly separated from particles that started in other regions , as shown in figure [ velocity_partition](c ) .",
    "thus the ridges in the sensitivity field , have the property of a separatrix .",
    "eq .   can be diagonalised as @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the eigenvalues of the jacobian of the fluid velocity field .",
    "if @xmath15 , is very large , then both the components of @xmath76 would decay . for low values of @xmath77",
    ", one component of @xmath76 would grow .",
    "therefore the dynamics of an inertial particles depend on the value of @xmath77 , that is on the stokes number .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the computations of the sensitivity of the particles location to the initial relative velocity also would depend on the stokes number . that this is indeed the case is shown by the computations of the sensitivity field for a particle with stokes number @xmath78 for the time independent flow , as shown in figure [ particle_separation](a ) .",
    "the thick lines are the ridges in sensitivity field for particles with @xmath79 and the hatched lines are those of @xmath80 .",
    "it can be seen that though the structure of the sensitivity field field is similar , the ridges are present at different locations in the relative velocity subspace .",
    "this fact can be exploited to design a process to separate particles by their stokes number . in this section",
    "we illustrate a simple procedure for doing this .",
    "the ridges of the sensitivity fields computed for the two different particles of stokes number 0.1 and 0.2 respectively are overlain in the same plot , as shown in figure [ particle_separation ] .",
    "the subdomain of the relative velocity subspace sandwiched between the ridges of the sensitivity fields of the two types of particles form a zone of segregation .",
    "one such sample zone is shown in grey in figure [ particle_separation ] .",
    "two particles with @xmath81 and @xmath82 with initial coordinates @xmath73 and the same initial relative velocity , belonging to this region , have trajectories that separate in the physical space . to illustrate this , the trajectories of five hundred particles of each stokes number , starting at the same initial physical point @xmath73 and with initial relative velocities values belonging to the grey region were computed .",
    "the position of these particles is plotted as a function of time to show that the particles are completely segregated into two different cells .",
    "the above procedure can be applied to other regions sandwiched between the ridges of the partial ftle of the two different types of particles .",
    "the time - independent flow given the stream function in eq .",
    "is perturbed by making it weakly time dependent .",
    "the modified fluid flow is given by the stream function    @xmath83    the velocity field is given by ,    @xmath84    @xmath85    for time dependent systems the location of the lcs depends on the choice of initial time .",
    "for the computation of the sensitivity field , the location of ridges in the relative velocity subspace depend on the initial spatial coordinates of the particle as well as the initial time .",
    "however our computations show that the dependence of the ridge structure on the initial time is weak .",
    "figure [ ridge_robust ] shows the ridges in the sensitivity field . as the initial time",
    "is increased , it is seen that there is a ` squeezing ' of the sensitivity field in some regions of the relative velocity subspace . a comparison with figure [ particle_separation ] and figure [ velocity_partition ] shows that the ridge locations in the sensitivity field remain qualitatively the same , for the three cases figure [ ridge_robust ] where the initial time is small .",
    "this offers a numerical evidence that the sensitivity field is robust to small perturbations in the fluid velocity .",
    "the dynamics of inertial particles in a fluid flow can exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "the finite time lyapunov exponent can be used to characterize this sensitivity .",
    "the lcs obtained from the ridges of the ftle field offers a systematic method to identify qualitatively different regions of the phase space .",
    "we demonstrated that even a reduced one dimensional ridge in the sensitivity field contains important information about the sensitivity of the spatial location of particles to initial relative velocity .",
    "the stokes number , and by implication the size of the particle , is an important parameter that governs the clustering behavior of particles for a given flow .",
    "this property can be exploited to make particles of different sizes cluster in different regions of the fluid and thus separate them . for the more general case of non neutrally buoyant particles , the density of the particles could play a similar governing role as the stokes number .",
    "one could therefore design flows that can fractionally separate particles for a range of inertial parameters .",
