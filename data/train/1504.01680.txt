    "planets discovered by the kepler observatory @xcite exhibit a large range of densities ranging from less than 1 g  @xmath0 ( e.g. kepler 36c ; @xcite and kepler 79d , @xcite ) to greater than 8 g  @xmath0 ( e.g. kepler 10b , @xcite ) . for neptune and earth mass planets ,",
    "the inferred gaseous envelope masses range from zero to tens of percent of the total planetary mass , with this fraction being dependent on whether a rock / iron or ice core is adopted @xcite .",
    "either close - in planets are formed with a wide range of core to envelope mass ratios , or their compositions evolve after they have accreted gas ( and after evaporation of the circumstellar disk ) .",
    "evaporative winds driven by stellar uv and x - ray radiation could account for the loss of a significant fraction of a neptune - sized planet s gaseous envelope mass @xcite .",
    "impacts or collisions between bodies that are more frequent at small semi - major axis can also affect the planetary composition ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among planet pairs in multiple - planet systems , a larger fraction ( @xmath1 ) of systems have the smaller radius planet residing closer to the star @xcite .",
    "along with the closer in planet generally being denser @xcite . as more mass",
    "can be evaporated closer to a star , evaporative winds could account for this trend @xcite .",
    "in addition , evidence for mass loss through atmospheric evaporation have been observed for the hot jupiters around hd 209458 @xcite and hd 189733 @xcite , with loss rates estimated to be on the order of @xmath2 .    an evaporative wind from an exoplanet",
    "is often assumed to be isotropic .",
    "however , an evaporative wind carries momentum and could exert a torque on the planet affecting both its orbit and spin . here",
    "we first summarize related physical phenomena .",
    "@xcite showed that an anisotropic stellar wind can cause orbital inclination changes .",
    "the yarkovsky effect occurs when uneven re - emission of absorbed stellar radiation causes drifts in asteroid semi - major axes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been shown that sublimation from a comet can exert a reactive torque on the cometary nucleus @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that an anisotropy in an evaporative wind from a close - in jupiter- or neptune - mass planet can cause the planet s orbit to migrate ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that migration distances inferred from distributions of planetary mass and orbits could be used to constrain the launch angle of the evaporative wind . in this paper",
    "we attempt to estimate the launch angle of the wind and the magnitude of the resulting reactive torque on the planet based on hydrodynamical models .",
    "as evaporation is primarily significant for low core mass planets experiencing high uv and x - ray fluxes @xcite from the star , we focus here on winds driven from warm neptunes and super - earth like planets within 0.2 au of a star .",
    "as the cooling timescale in an ionosphere is expected to be shorter than a day , an evaporative wind is mainly expected to be driven from the day side of a planet . if the planet is not tidally locked or if the atmosphere is circulating then the upper atmosphere would experience day / night variations in stellar illumination .",
    "a delay between dawn and the time it takes for the wind to develop could cause an asymmetry in the wind ( see figure [ fig : wind_pic ] ) . here",
    "we aim to estimate the torque on a planet due to this possible asymmetry .",
    "planets within 0.2 au are expected to be tidally locked and at low obliquity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "spin - down should have taken place in less than @xmath3 years ( see table 1 by @xcite ) , and well before the time when most of the evaporation takes place , at an age @xmath4 years @xcite .",
    "however , some planets could now be in a spin synchronous state ( with rotation rate related to the angular rotation rate at pericenter , @xcite ) or spin - orbit resonance @xcite like mercury . even though the tidal spin - down timescale is short",
    ", the timescale for tidal circularization of the orbit is relatively long ( e.g. , @xcite ) and planets could have been at moderate ( or their current ) eccentricities when atmospheric evaporation took place . about a quarter of the planets in multiple - planet kepler systems with transit - timing variations",
    "have high eccentricities , in the range e=0.1 - 0.4 @xcite . in exoplanetary systems containing at least two planets ,",
    "transit timing variations are consistent with an eccentricity dispersion of @xmath5 when fit with a rayleigh distribution @xcite .",
    "even if a planet is tidally locked , the upper atmosphere can be rotating with advective or zonal flow speeds of order @xmath6  km / s @xcite .",
    "if the advective flow speed is of order the sound speed ( e.g. , @xcite ) then we expect a wind speed @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the equilibrium temperature set by radiation balance from the stellar light .",
    "as this is weakly dependent on the planet s semi - major axis ( @xmath9 with @xmath10 the semi - major axis of the planet ) , for simplicity we can neglect the possible dependence of advective flow speed on stellar flux .",
    "we also neglect the dependence on planet properties such as atmospheric opacity and surface gravity , as atmospheric models all predict similar circulation speeds .",
    "evaporative winds are driven from a tenuous region of a planetary atmosphere where ionization and heating occur , and this layer is higher than typically modelled to predict atmospheric circulation .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath111 km / s size - scale zonal flows are predicted in exoplanet ionospheres ( see figure 3 by @xcite ) .    for completeness",
    ", we note that , in addition to the effects outlined above , magnetic fields on the planetary surface will lead to anisotropy .",
    "more specifically , with the expected mass loss rate from planets and surface field strengths of @xmath11 1 gauss , the outflows could be magnetically controlled ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "this issue must be addressed in future work .    both zonal circulation or a spin - orbit resonance would cause a planetary ionosphere to experience day / night variations . in section",
    "[ sec : rough ] we estimate a torque due to an evaporative wind by considering the relationship between atmospheric motion and the timescale to launch a wind at dawn , as this is expected to dominate the rotation of gas in the upper atmosphere , unless the planet is in an unusual spin - orbit resonance . in section",

    "lastly in [ sec : kep36 ] we investigate scenarios for the kepler 36 planetary system taking into account an evaporative wind induced torque .",
    "variations in the planet s orbital elements caused by a torque from an anisotropic evaporative wind , integrated over the orbit , are computed in the appendix .",
    "in this section we roughly estimate a lag angle and the torque exerted by the wind onto the planet .",
    "we first derive a launch timescale for the wind , and compare it to the circulation timescale in the upper atmosphere .",
    "stellar x - ray and euv radiation heats gas up to temperatures @xmath12 k @xcite corresponding to a sound speed of @xmath13 km / s .",
    "above this temperature radiative cooling is so efficient that higher temperatures are rarely reached .",
    "as @xmath14 is similar to a planet s escape velocity , a wind can be launched from the heated gas .",
    "an isothermal or parker - type wind model @xcite gives an approximate hydrodynamical description for evaporative winds from close - in planets , i.e. , planets for which evaporative winds can be important ( out to about 0.2 au , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a wind can not be instantaneously launched at dawn .",
    "we can estimate a launch timescale for the wind from the time it takes a particle in the wind to travel from the planet s surface , at a planetary radius @xmath15 , to the transonic radius , @xmath16 ( where the flow becomes supersonic ) , and is no longer in causal contact with the planet .",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the wind velocity as a function of radius .",
    "the one - dimensional hydrodynamic models that include ionization and heating by x - rays , @xcite have @xmath19 ( see their figure 4 ) and @xmath20  km  s@xmath21 , where @xmath15 is the planet s radius . using these larger transonic radii",
    "we find : @xmath22    the motion of the upper atmosphere wind , described by a zonal wind speed @xmath23 , and the timescale to launch the wind together imply that the wind is not launched at dawn but slightly afterwards .",
    "it would take a similar time for the evaporative wind to die down after dusk .",
    "the delay implies that the average wind momentum is not pointing exactly toward the star along the sub - stellar point but is shifted by an angle @xmath24 from this direction ( see figure [ fig : wind_pic ] ) .",
    "we estimate this angle to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the inverse of the atmosphere s angular rotation rate .",
    "a comparison between equation ( [ eqn : t_zonal ] ) and equation ( [ eqn : t_flow ] ) suggests that the angle @xmath24 could be of order 1 and the wind could exert a significant torque on the planet .",
    "if @xmath27 then we could consider the wind launched evenly from both day and night sides .",
    "if @xmath28 then the momentum flux from the wind ( averaged over all regions on the planet surface ) is in the radial direction toward the star , and there is no torque exerted by the wind onto the planet . we have used a flow timescale to estimate the time it takes to launch the wind that is based on a steady state flow model .",
    "an alternative thermal timescale , @xmath29 , that can be used to estimate a wind launch timescale is the time it takes to replenish the kinetic energy in the flow within the sonic radius from the absorbed euv and x - ray energy flux . depending upon the ratio of the transonic to planet radius , and as we discuss below",
    ", a thermal timescale may more accurately describe the time it takes to launch the wind .",
    "we detail this possibility in section [ sec : theta ] .",
    "we have neglected the wind speed s tangential velocity component in our estimate for @xmath24 as @xmath30 is significantly smaller than the escape velocity from the planet surface .",
    "the orbital torque ( from the wind ) can be roughly estimated from the lag angle @xmath24 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the wind mass outflow rate and @xmath33 is a mean wind velocity near the transonic region .",
    "the rough factor of 2 comes from integrating a radial wind over a hemisphere with an angular offset .",
    "the sign of the lag is set by the direction of the planet s spin or atmospheric flow .",
    "if the planet s spin or the atmospheric circulation are prograde ( super - rotating or eastward ) then the torque is positive and we expect the planet to move outwards .",
    "the sign is in direct analogy to the yarkovsky effect ( see @xcite ) , with outward migration in semi - major axis for prograde asteroid body rotation and vice versa for retrograde body rotation .",
    "close - in exoplanet atmospheric circulation models usually predict prograde ( super - rotating or eastward ) equatorial upper atmospheric circulation @xcite , with the exception of the retrograde ( westward ) slowly rotating model for hd 209458b by @xcite . although , we caution that the atmospheric rotation of low - mass close in exoplanets has not been studied and note in passing that the circulation direction in neptune and uranus is retrograde .    here",
    "we also note that the evaporative wind could affect the spin evolution of the planet .",
    "the torque on the planet itself we estimate as @xmath34 where @xmath23 is the atmosphere circulation velocity and we assume that the wind is launched at a radius that is not significantly different than @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the spin of the planet . assuming that @xmath36 and after time @xmath37 , one gets a change in planet spin of @xmath38 where the planet s moment of inertia is @xmath39 . for short - period , tidally locked planets , this effect could act to desynchronise the planet s spin , provided synchronisation occurred before the evaporation became important .",
    "a strong evaporative wind is driven when the host star has a strong euv and x - ray flux or during an age less than @xmath40 years @xcite . during this time , a planet of mass @xmath41 can experience a loss of mass @xmath42 and a change in semi - major axis @xmath43 .",
    "the change in the planet s orbital angular momentum is @xmath44 where @xmath41 is the planet mass and @xmath45 the planet s orbital velocity ( assuming a nearly circular orbit ) , which scales as @xmath46 using equation ( [ eqn : tau_w ] ) for the torque , we estimate @xmath47 the factor @xmath48 limits the size - scale of the possible migration distance in semi - major axis .",
    "many of the kepler planet host stars have masses lower than @xmath49 @xcite and for these lower mass stars the ratio @xmath48 would be higher .",
    "previous studies @xcite have found that close - in low core mass planets can loose a significant fraction of their mass .",
    "taking @xmath50 and @xmath51 , equation ( [ eqn : da ] ) gives @xmath52 a planet that loses a significant fraction of its mass could move a significant fraction ( say 10% ) of its semi - major axis .",
    "10% exceeds the distance to resonance exhibited by resonant pairs @xcite and is dynamically significant , particularly for close resonant pairs such as kepler 36b , c @xcite .    in appendix",
    "[ ap : orbital ] , we derive more general equations for the secular evolution of semi - major axis and eccentricity for a planet whose orbit is perturbed by an evaporative wind .",
    "in the previous section we estimated the torque on a planet due to evaporative wind loss using a crudely approximated launch timescale for the wind . in this section",
    "we use the steady - state hydrodynamic models , including radiative cooling and ionization , by @xcite to better estimate the lag angle @xmath24 that sets the torque from the wind .",
    "as discussed above we take the flow timescale to be the time to establish an evaporative flow .",
    "it is the time the flow takes to reach the sonic point and is thus found by :    @xmath53    where @xmath18 is the velocity field of the flow .",
    "the flow solutions from @xcite allow us to directly perform this calculations without making further assumptions . a comparison between this flow timescale and the zonal wind timescale using a zonal wind velocity of 1  km  s@xmath21 ( equation  [ [ eqn : t_zonal ] ] ) is shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : tflowtkh ] . in line with our discussion in section  2",
    "the flow timescale is of order the zonal flow timescale for neptune like planets .",
    "one further consideration is that the flow receives enough energy to launch the wind , we call this timescale the `` kelvin - helmhotlz timescale '' of the flow ( following owen & adams , 2014 )",
    ". we can also estimate the time it takes to heat the wind from a ratio of kinetic energy ( integrated out to the sonic radius , @xmath54 ) and the energy absorbed per unit time in uv and x - ray photons , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the density in the wind at @xmath16 and @xmath57 is the flux in x - ray and euv photons from the star .",
    "in analogy to the kelvin - helmholtz timescale we write@xmath58 where the numerator represents the integral of the energy density in the flow over the volume within the sonic radius . we show the calculated `` kelvin - helmhotz timescales '' compared to the zonal flow timescale in the right panel of figure  [ fig : tflowtkh ] .",
    "we find that the flow timescale dominates the launch timescale when the potential is deep ( as the suppression of the launch velocity is exponentially sensitive to planet mass ) and the flow is not close to `` energy - limited '' ( see discussion in owen & jackson 2012 ) .",
    "however , when the potential is shallow , the sonic point is very close to the planet s surface and the flow timescale is essentially zero . in this case",
    "the timescale to launch the wind is controlled by the energy considerations .        in reality",
    "both timescales matter .",
    "therefore we define a `` launch timescale '' as the root - mean square of the tow timescales , and we compare it to the zonal flow timescale .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : tflowrms ] .",
    "it shows that there is a reasonably wide band of planet parameters where the launch timescale compared to the zonal timescale is order unity .",
    "we compare it to the existing sample of exoplanets .",
    "we use the database from the open exoplanet catalogue @xcite , for all planets with orbital period lower than 100 days .",
    "a small fraction of the super - earth to netpune - like planets are in the range where the timescale ratio ( and hence our estimated lag angle ) is of order unity .     as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tflow ] ) for an x - ray + euv stellar luminosity of @xmath59 erg / s and a semi - major axis of 0.1 au , using the results of numerical simulations presented in @xcite , and @xmath60 as given by equation [ eq : tkh ] . as a guide",
    ", we also plot a sample of exoplanets with orbital periods less than 100 days .",
    "in addition , the star represents neptune , while the circle represents a pre - evaporation kepler 36b . ]",
    "to improve on the estimates of section [ sec : theta ] we carry out some one dimensional but time - dependent hydrodynamic models . from these",
    "we directly estimate the lag angle and the vector direction of the momentum carried by the evaporative wind .",
    "we conduct a set of simulations using zeus @xcite .",
    "the code we us includes modifications for uv ionization described in detail by owen & adams ( 2014 ) as well as time - dependant heating and cooling described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the numerical method takes into account ionization by a range of euv photons , and as such includes photon - hardening using the method of @xcite , assuming a pure hydrogen atmosphere , where ray - tracing is performed in a causal manner starting at the edge of the grid and working towards the planet .",
    "heating is dominated by photo - ionization and cooling from lyman-@xmath61 and recombinations .",
    "3d simulations of this problem are beyond the scope of this work and therefore we chose to setup a simple illustrative problem , that combined with the insight from our discussion above , allows us to make inferences about the role of evaporation in driving a planetary torque .",
    "our setup is as follows : we consider a small patch of the planet rotating with azimuthal velocity @xmath62 such as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the latitude of the patch .",
    "for each patch we solve the 1 + 1d ( including the evolution of @xmath65 ) in spherical co - ordinates .",
    "we note that this implicitly assumes that the flow has spherical divergence along the streamline and we neglect any pressure forces perpendicular to the radial direction .",
    "this is obviously a simplification ; however for a thermally driven outflow the pressure forces in the radial direction must dominate . during the calculation",
    "we then modulate the input uv flux as a function of time to mimic the patch rotating from the day to night side and wait to a quasi - repetitious flow is established , after several rotation periods of the patch .",
    "once we have simulated different patches at different latitudes we can then `` stitch '' the flow patterns together to gain an estimate of what the 3d flow structure is like .",
    "in particular , we can then explicitly estimate what the net torque on the planet is .",
    "as we have stitched together several patches one loses the constrain the momentum flux will be conserved in a global 3d sense ; and as such we must be cautious in interpreting our results .",
    "the grid is radially divided in 128 cells , and the time - step is such that it takes about 100 iterations for a patch to go around the planet . in total",
    "there are 61 patches going from south pole to north pole .",
    "the outer boundary of the radial grid is such that all the flow becomes supersonic inside the grid .",
    "first , we study a neptune - like planet , with a radius of @xmath66 cm and a mass of @xmath67 g. it is irradiated with a flux of @xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to a planet at 0.013 au from a star with a x - ray and uv luminosity of @xmath69 , i.e. a young solar - type star . in what follows ,",
    "we also note @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath18 the density , pressure , and velocity fields of the flow .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sonicmapnept ] we show the sonic point for different latitudes and longitudes , on the day - side only . as expected ,",
    "the sonic point is close to the planetary surface around the substellar point .",
    "however , the minimum of the curve appears to be offset from the substellar point by a few degrees .",
    "we estimate that , at the equator , the minimum sonic radius is offset from the sub - stellar point by @xmath72 westward .        from this set of simulation",
    ", we can also extract the total mass loss , from our combined stitched together 3d flow solution , integrated over the longitudes @xmath73 and latitudes @xmath64 , at an altitude @xmath74 ( e.g. , the sonic radius ) .",
    "it reads : @xmath75 in this case we find it to be @xmath76 , similar to the 1d spherically symmetric mass - loss rate of @xcite .",
    "another relevant quantity is the the momentum loss rate of the wind , @xmath77 , whose components @xmath78 are given by : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the gravitational field of the planet .",
    "@xmath77 is a vector , which we give in the following reference frame : the origin is at the substellar point , the @xmath81 direction lies along the line that goes from the substellar point the the star , the @xmath82 axis is perpendicular to the @xmath81 axis along the equator in the east direction , and the @xmath83 is perpendicular to the equator in the north direction .",
    "the problem is symmetric with regard to the planet s equator , so that the @xmath83 contribution cancels out once integrated over the whole planetary surface .",
    "we estimate the lag angle of the wind @xmath24 through the relation @xmath84 the integration is made in spherical coordinates , over our 3d stitched together flow solution , at a constant distance from the planet surface .    in the present simulations we find that the value of @xmath24 depends on the distance at which the integration is conducted , as shown on figure @xmath85 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that our stitched flow solution does not conserve momentum explicitly in the angular directions as discussed above . in any case",
    ", we find that the mass loss is strongly anisotropic , with a lag angle of several tens of degrees .",
    "our one dimensional time - dependent model has therefore allowed us to show that a short - period , strongly irradiated , neptune - like planet , looses mass at rate similar to other studies .",
    "in addition the momentum flux indicates that mass loss is anisotropic , and occurs at an angle that is offset from the substellar point by a few tenths of radians .",
    "according to our estimate in equation ( [ eqn : da ] ) , this would shift the semi - major axis of the planet by about 0.3% after 100 myr . in appendix",
    "[ ap : orbital ] we also give a more general formula for the rate of change in semi - major axis due to the force exerted by the wind , which we can extract directly from the momentum flux . using eq . ( [ eqn : tau_a ] ) we find that over 100  myr , the hot neptune that we considered above would have migrated outward by about 1% from the location at which we estimated the momentum flux ( 0.013 au ) .     as a function of the radial distance @xmath74 from the planetary surface , for a neptune - like planet . ]",
    "kepler 36b has a density @xmath86 g  @xmath0 whereas kepler 36c has @xmath87 g  @xmath0 .",
    "kepler 36b is the lighter denser planet , suggesting that it could have lost much of its mass in a wind .",
    "the kepler 36 exoplanet system is thought to have obtained such a dichotomy in densities due to evaporation @xcite .",
    "if the torque on the planet was positive during evaporative wind loss then the planet would have migrated outward , pushing it closer to kepler 36c .",
    "this would have pushed the system deeper into the 7:6 resonance rather than pulling it slightly out of resonance .    currently , the system is just slightly outside of resonance with the separation between the two bodies larger than that of exact resonance @xcite .",
    "the two planets in this system could not have migrated much further apart as that would have made the system unstable @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found that the peculiar architecture of the kepler 36 system can be reproduced by evaporation of a pair of planets with cores of 4.45 @xmath88 ( inner planet ) 7.34 @xmath88 and ( outer planet ) .",
    "both cores are surrounded by a gaseous atmosphere , which initially contains about 23% of the total mass of the planet in the form of hydrogen and helium . because of the close proximity of the pair of planets and the star , the atmospheres of the formers undergo hydrodynamical escape , mainly during the first @xmath89 yr , when the stellar flux is stronger .",
    "since the core of the inner planet is less massive , it is unable to keep its atmosphere and only the dense rocky core remains , which we observe today .",
    "the outer planet manages to retain an extended gaseous envelope , resulting in an observed low mean density .",
    "the two planets of the kepler 36 system are also very close to a 7:6 mean motion resonance . in this paper",
    "we study the possibility for the inner planet to have been slightly shifted out of the resonance under the action of the torque exerted by its own evaporating atmosphere .",
    "we conduct hydrodynamical simulations similar to the ones presented above , for a planet consisting of a rocky core of 4.45 @xmath88 and an atmosphere whose mass is 22% of the core mass , and extends to 10 @xmath90 , in agreement to the model by @xcite .",

    "the sonic radius as a function of longitudes , at the equator , is presented in figure [ fig : sonicmapk36 ] , and includes both day and night sides .",
    "the minimum sonic point is largely offset from the substellar point , in the east direction .",
    "on the night side , the atmosphere does not entirely cool down and a wind still exists because of the temperature at the base of the atmosphere , which is set to 1000 k in our simulations .    on figure [ fig : rthetak36b ]",
    "we observe that the lag angle is minimum ( and negative ) at intermediate radii ( @xmath92 ) . in our simulations",
    "we remark that on the days - side , the wind is rapidly launched and decreases in density at large radii and never reaches a quasi steady state . on the night - side",
    ", there still exists a transonic point at which the wind is launched ( see figure [ fig : sonicmapk36 ] ) .",

    "this is fairly consistent with equation ( [ eqn : tau_a ] ) , which predicts an inward drift of 0.2% after 100  myr when the torque is maximum .",
    "we have also conducted simulations for a pre - evaporation kepler 36c planet , using again the model by @xcite .",

    "@xcite found ( following @xcite ) that it was difficult to account for the distance of the kepler 36 system from the 7:6 resonance ( assuming it was originally left there ) using tidal forces alone ( though the effect of larger planet radii and masses at earlier times and prior to evaporation was not taken into account ) .",
    "some models of tidal evolution predict low eccentricity after escape from resonance ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * with the exception of the scenario by @xcite ) .",
    "however the kepler 36 system is near some second order resonances and , if there was divergent evolution a resonance crossing could perhaps have lifted the eccentricity of the two planets to near their current values @xmath102 @xcite .    while second order resonance crossing ( due to drift caused by an evaporative wind ) presents a possible explanation for kepler 36 s eccentricity , lower index resonances such as the 3:2 are more distant from second order resonances .",
    "only if the wind increases the eccentricity could non - zero eccentricities in lower index resonances be related to orbital variations associated with an evaporative wind .",
    "in this paper we have studied the torque exerted by an evaporative wind on planets with properties of super - earth or hot neptunes .",
    "evaporative winds driven from close - in planet by euv and x - ray radiation from a star are unlikely to be isotropic .",
    "if the upper atmosphere of a wind undergoing heavy mass loss is super - rotating , then we estimate that there would be a lag on the dawn side between the time the upper atmosphere is illuminated by starlight and when a newly launched wind becomes transonic .",
    "this lag results in a torque on the planet .",
    "a planet that loses a significant fraction of its mass could drift by a small amount in semi - major axis . by estimating wind launch timescales we find that only in a narrow regime of planet radius , mass and uv + x - ray flux can the lag angle be significant .",
    "consequently only in rare cases could a planet s orbit ( or eccentricity ) be affected by the wind s torque .",
    "our 1d , time - dependent , hydrodynamical simulations have shown that for a close - in , neptune - like planet , the anisotropic torque exerted by the wind does not strongly affect the semi - major axis of the planet .",
    "for the cases we have considered here , a neptune - like planet on a short period orbit could undergo a semi - major axis drift of the order of @xmath103",
    ". however , this small effect has slightly more significant consequences in the case of kepler 36b . the small change in semi - major axis that the wind could cause might be important in sculpting the near - resonant configuration of the system .",
    "we find that the amount of drifting in semi - major axis caused by an anisotropic wind toque could possibly account for kepler 36 b , c s distance from the 7:6 resonance .    more generally , this mechanism has important consequences for close - in resonant pairs of planets .",
    "if the wind circulates in the prograde direction , the torque arising from the evaporative wind would cause outward migration of the innermost planet . assuming that the outer planet is less affected ( as it receives a weaker flux ) then the pair would be pushed deeper inside resonance .",
    "therefore , any mechanism that predicts resonance repulsion should be strong enough to counteract the torque arising from an evaporative wind .",
    "if the wind circulation was retrograde , then the innermost planet would be pushed inward .",
    "we have found that for the case of kepler 36b , it is enough to bring it to its current location just outside the 7:6 mean motion resonance .",
    "hence , there is strong motivation to do global circulation models for strongly irradiated hot neptunes .",
    "we note that for low order resonances , such as the 2:1 resonance , the effect of the torque on @xmath104 ( distance to resonance ) might be weak because of the large orbital separation between the two planets ( compared to 7:6 resonance , for instance ) .",
    "however , we point out that m type stars have a strong x - ray flux for about 1 gyr , so the time - integrated effect for planets around such stars will be more important .",
    "the values we have estimated for the lag angle depend on the zonal speed we use ( here 1 km / s ) .",
    "if the zonal winds were rotating slower , the lag angle would also be smaller , which would minimize the influence of the torque . in this sense , the lag angle that we derive here can regarded as an upper limit on how an evaporative wind can affect a planet s orbit . global 3d simulations of evaporative atmospheres could also put more accurate constraints , since our 1 + 1d simulations can only be considered illustrative of the kind of anisotropic winds that will arise .",
    "3d simulations would not suffer from the uncertainly in the lag angle that arises from our approach .    0.2 truein ",
