    "one path to addressing the hierarchy problem is to consider extensions of the standard model that lessen the degrees of divergence of loop integrals .",
    "historically , supersymmetry has been the most popular approach of this type .",
    "loop diagrams involving the supersymmetric partners of ordinary particles cancel the quadratic divergence of the higgs boson squared mass that would otherwise be present .",
    "the surviving dependence on any high mass scales in the theory is only logarithmic , so that extreme fine tuning is avoided . in lee - wick theories  @xcite , in particular the lee - wick standard model  @xcite , more convergent loop diagrams are assured by the introduction of higher - derivative kinetic terms that yield propagators that fall off more quickly with momentum .",
    "however , a propagator whose inverse is a higher - order polynomial in the momentum will have additional poles .",
    "this fact is reflected in an auxiliary field formulation of lee - wick theories in which higher - derivative terms are absent , but additional field are present that correspond to these lee - wick partner states  @xcite .",
    "diagrams involving the lee - wick partner particles serve to cancel unwanted quadratic divergences , and hence play a role similar to the partner particles in supersymmetric theories .    among the scenarios with partner particles that address the hierarchy problem , lee - wick theories are particularly unusual .",
    "the partner states in lee - wick theories have wrong - sign kinetic and mass terms , requiring special rules to be applied so that the theory has a chance at a sensible interpretation  @xcite .",
    "however , such states need not appear in all theories with with higher - derivative quadratic terms  @xcite .",
    "given the possibility of applications in addressing the hierarchy problem  @xcite , it is well motivated to consider higher - derivative theories in which the complications of lee - wick theories might be avoided altogether .",
    "as an example of the type of theory of interest here , consider @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a real scalar field , @xmath2 and the momentum - space propagator is given at tree - level by @xmath3 if @xmath4 is an entire function , then there will be no additional poles in eq .",

    "( we restrict ourselves to even @xmath9 so that @xmath6 provides a convergence factor in either euclidean or minkowski space . )",

    "the consequences of nonlocal modifications of the quadratic terms in the lagrangian were discussed as early as the 1950 s  @xcite , but have periodically met a resurgence of interest  @xcite . motivated by the infinite - derivative lagrangians obtained in string field theory  @xcite and @xmath10-adic string theory  @xcite , nonlocal theories of the general type of interest here were studied as possible models of inflation  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the possibility that such nonlocal quadratic terms could provide an avenue for quantizing gravity has also been discussed  @xcite . of particular motivation here is the work of ref .",
    "@xcite which applies nonlocal modifications of the quadratic terms to parts of the standard model itself and considers some aspects of the phenomenology .",
    "a more extensive list of background references on nonlocal field theories and their applications can be found in that work .",
    "@xcite , like most phenomenological studies of proposed modifications to the standard model , ultimately focuses on scattering processes , which reflect the overlap of asymptotic states defined in the far past and far future . in the context of lee - wick theories ,",
    "it was pointed out by grinstein , oconnel and wise ( gow ) that the distinctive acausal features of the theory could be studied by considering the time - dependence of the scattering processes via a wave - packet analysis conducted in the semi - classical limit  @xcite , as we discuss in more detail later .",
    "the trajectories of wave packets can be used to define the apparent production and decay points of an exchanged resonance , and the dependence of the amplitude on the ordering of these events evaluated .",
    "gow worked with a theory of real scalar fields with o(@xmath11 ) symmetry , where the unitarity of the theory could be demonstrated to all orders in perturbation theory in the large @xmath11 limit .",
    "as argued by coleman  @xcite , the existence of a unitary @xmath12-matrix implies that observable acausality does not lead to logical paradoxes in scattering experiments , since there is a unitary evolution of initial states to final states .",
    "the question that we wish to study in the present work is how the approach and conclusions of gow are modified if one instead assumes a theory with an infinite - derivative modification of the quadratic terms , one that does not introduce additional poles with wrong - sign residues in the propagator at tree - level .",
    "we proceed largely by analogy , first addressing the issue of unitarity in a specific nonlocal extension of the o(@xmath11 ) model studied by gow .",
    "unitarity in nonlocal theories has been discussed in a more general context in refs .",
    "@xcite and in a different context in ref .",
    "what we gain by working in the large @xmath11 limit of the o(@xmath11 ) model is that unitarity can be studied in explicit detail , to all orders in perturbation theory , via a one - loop calculation .",

    "the reader who is familiar with the phenomenological work of ref .",
    "@xcite will recall that the authors define their nonlocal theory via euclidean correlation functions that are analytically continued in their external momentum to minkowski space .",

    "what our consideration of unitarity and causality demonstrate up to this point is that the theory of interest may show signs of acausality in scattering experiments without logical inconsistency , in the sense discussed by coleman . to address this further , we turn to the scattering of wave packets in the latter half of sec .  [",

    "these are chosen so that in the process of interest , we can specify well - defined production and decay vertices for the resonance , in this case associated with the field @xmath1 , exchanged in the @xmath28-channel . to be more explicit ,",

    "we do not display the analogous expressions for @xmath221 , corresponding to the outgoing wave packet states . in the same limit described in our earlier example involving a classical source , the momentum and @xmath222 integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spints ] ) can be evaluated in the stationary phase approximation , leading to a result of the form @xmath223 where the functions @xmath6 and @xmath224 have localized support at @xmath225 and @xmath226 , respectively .",

    "the sign flip affects the sign of the width appearing in one of the exponential factors in the amplitude , leading to the interpretation that the exponential decay is happening as the lee - wick resonance propagates backward in time from the decay to production vertex . here",
    ", however , the form of @xmath232 corresponds to propagation forward in time over the time - like interval @xmath242 .",
    "the nonlocality in the theory leads to a spatial smearing of the interaction points so that one no longer identifies @xmath242 with the physical spacetime separation of the extrapolated decay and production vertices .",
