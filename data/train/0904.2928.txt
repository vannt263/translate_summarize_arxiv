    "wormholes are handles or tunnels in the spacetime topology connecting two separate and distinct regions of spacetime",
    ". these regions may be part of our universe or of different universes .",
    "the pioneer work of morris and thorne @xcite has shown that macroscopic wormholes may be actual physical objects , provided that certain energy conditions are violated .",
    "several wormhole studies have added the cosmological constant @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when einstein first introduced the cosmological constant into his field equations in 1917 , he was still striving for consistency with mach s principle . from the standpoint of cosmology ,",
    "however , @xmath0 served to create a kind of repulsive pressure to yield a stationary universe .",
    "eventually zeldovich identified @xmath0 with the vacuum energy density due to quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed from time to time that the  constant \" is actually a variable parameter .",
    "for example , in discussing a family of asymptotically flat globally regular solutions to the einstein field equations , dymnikova @xcite notes that the source term corresponds to an @xmath1-dependent @xmath0 .",
    "assuming that @xmath0 does indeed have the form @xmath2 , rahaman , _ et .",
    ", @xcite obtained a class of wormhole solutions , while ray , _ et .",
    ", @xcite studied various models that can be applied to the classical electron of the lorentz type .",
    "cosmic strings with @xmath2 are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the variable @xmath0 is derived from a higher spatial dimension and manifests itself as an energy - density for the vacuum .",
    "another widely discussed possibility is a space- and time - dependent @xmath0 , i. e. , @xmath3 , suggested by recent observations of high redshift type ia supernovae @xcite . for a detailed discussion with an extensive list of references , see alcaniz @xcite . for various @xmath0-decay scenarios from the original high value during inflation to the present , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "@xcite discusses the big bang , as well as the  big bounce , \" referring to variable-@xmath0 models having a non - singular origin .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that if @xmath0 is both space and time dependent , so that @xmath3 , then a wormhole of the morris - thorne type will have a curvature singularity at the center .",
    "using units in which @xmath4 our starting point is the einstein - de sitter metric @xmath5 which is the unique solution of the vacuum einstein field equations for a spherically symmetric spacetime with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the line element reduces to the schwarzschild line element if @xmath6 the wormhole metric in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 provides a motivation for the following metric , proposed by delgaty and mann @xcite : @xmath8 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 is fixed , while the constant 1 is incorporated in the function m. ) here @xmath9 is called the _ redshift function_.",
    "if @xmath10 , then @xmath11",
    ". so @xmath12 will be called the _ shape function _ ; thus @xmath13 .",
    "( recall that in eq .",
    "( [ e : line2 ] ) , the sphere of radius @xmath14 is the _ throat _ of the wormhole . )",
    "qualitatively , @xmath12 has the form shown in fig .",
    "1 . observe that @xmath0 is a _ positive _ function of both @xmath1 and @xmath15 .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , since the wormhole described by the metric in eq .",
    "( [ e : line3 ] ) is dynamic , there are actually two throats on opposite sides of the _ center _ @xmath16 .",
    "this center is determined implicitly ( for any fixed @xmath15 ) from the equation @xmath17 ( observe that the entire sphere @xmath16 lies in the same time slice . ) after rearranging terms , we get for any fixed time - slice @xmath18 so for any fixed @xmath15 , a solution to eq .",
    "( [ e : fixpoint ] ) is a fixed point @xmath19 ( see fig . 1 .",
    ") since @xmath20 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are all positive ,    @xmath21 .",
    "so @xmath22 .",
    "since the sphere @xmath16 is the center of the wormhole , @xmath14 is not in the manifold , while each throat is a sphere with time - dependent radius @xmath23 .",
    "to study the presumptive wormhole solution , it is necessary to compute the components of the riemann curvature and einstein tensors using the following orthonormal basis : @xmath24 some of the components of the einstein tensor are listed next : @xmath25",
    "@xmath26 @xmath27 from the einstein field equations with cosmological constant , @xmath28 we obtain @xmath29 so @xmath30 @xmath31,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 is usually interpreted as the energy flux in the outward radial direction @xcite .",
    "now let us assume that at the throat @xmath34 the usual flare - out conditions have been met and that for every @xmath15 the weak energy condition ( wec ) has been violated .",
    "( the wec states that given the stress - energy tensor @xmath35 , the inequality @xmath36 holds for all time - like vectors and , by continuity , all null vectors . )",
    "so for the radial outgoing null vector @xmath37 we therefore have @xmath38 in this manner all the conditions for the existence of a wormhole appear to have been met .",
    "however , the real problem does not depend on any violation of the wec : in view of eq .",
    "( [ e : throat ] ) , we have for any given @xmath15 @xmath39 at the center @xmath16 .",
    "hence @xmath33 can not be a finite quantity as long as @xmath40 similarly , the components @xmath41 and @xmath42,which are proportional to the lateral pressure @xmath43 , can not be finite as long as @xmath0 is time dependent : @xmath44\\\\         + \\text{other tems}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    finally , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for a wormhole to be traversable by humanoid travelers , the radial tidal constraint must be met : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a component of the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "this component is given by @xmath47\\\\          + \\left(1-\\frac{m(r)}{r}-\\frac{\\lambda(r , t)r^2}{3}\\right )          \\left(\\phi''(r)+[\\phi'(r)]^2\\right)\\\\",

    "( [ e : throat ] ) , we see that , once again , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e : riemann ] ) can not be finite at the center as long as @xmath0 is time dependent .",
    "the same problem arises with the lateral tidal constraints .",
    "so even if the earlier problems did not occur , the wormhole would not be traversable .",
    "the singularities encountered so far could conceivably be removed by a suitable coordinate transformation . to show that the spacetime is singular , we need a scalar quantity that becomes infinite . to this end",
    "we list the components of the ricci tensor .",
    "first we define the function @xmath48 ^ 2\\right)\\\\+\\frac{1}{2}\\phi'(r )     \\left(\\frac{rm'(r)-m(r)}{r^2}\\right.\\\\+\\left .",
    "\\frac{2}{3}r\\lambda(r , t )      + \\frac{1}{3}r^2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\lambda(r , t)\\right ) .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] then @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52    now consider the square of the curvature scalar @xmath53 for any fixed @xmath15 ( that is , for any fixed time - slice ) , the term @xmath54 is divergent for some @xmath16 whenever @xmath55 being a scalar quantity , it diverges at the center in all coordinate systems .",
    "as we have seen , because of eqs .",
    "( [ e : t3 ] ) , ( [ e : g ] ) , and ( [ e : riemann ] ) , the energy flux , lateral pressure , and curvature can not be finite at the center of the wormhole as long as @xmath55 since the scalar quantity @xmath56 also diverges , there is a curvature sigularity at the center .",
    "it follows that for a wormhole of the morris - thorne type to exist , @xmath0 must not be time dependent . in the language of the topological censorship principle @xcite , causal curves originating from and ending in a simply connected asymptotic region do not see any non - trivial topology and can therefore be deformed to a curve contained entirely within the asymptotic region . in the present situation",
    ", an ingoing radial null geodesic continues to move inward and so can not pass through the wormhole and probe the topology .",
    "a time - dependent @xmath0 will therefore act as a topological censor for wormholes of the morris - thorne type .    9 m.s .",
