    "a central question in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is the origin of the pseudogap phase . this phase was originally thought to to be a precursor phase to superconductivity with spin - singlet pairs , no phase coherence , and no broken symmetries @xcite .",

    "this proposal was bolstered by a demonstration that pdw order accounts for anomalous quasi - particle ( qp ) properties observed by angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) @xcite .",

    "the pdw state discussed in ref .   gives rise to these properties , and it is natural to use this as a starting point .",
    "however , the glw theory based on the pdw momenta chosen in ref .   does not produce a ground state that satisfies the above four criteria and we must therefore consider generalizations of this state . to identify such a generalization , we note that a key feature of ref .   that allows the arpes spectra to be reproduced is the choice of the momenta about which fermions are paired . in particular , the mean - field pairing hamiltonian for pdw order is @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fermion destruction operator with momentum @xmath26 and spin @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the bare dispersion , and @xmath29 means hermitian conjugate .",

    "this emergent loop current phase shares the same symmetry properties as the me loop current state discussed in refs .  .",
    "while such a phase captures much of the physics associated with broken time - reversal symmetry , it does not provide a complete explanation of all the signatures of broken time - reversal symmetry in the pseudogap phase @xcite .",
    "we address this in the next section .",
    "it has been argued that the kerr effect @xcite is zero for the me loop current state discussed above and a non - vanishing kerr effect requires additional physics ( such as a structural transition @xcite or ordering along the @xmath42-axis ) .",
    "this has been discussed in detail by yakovenko @xcite and he has identified a modified loop current state consistent with all experiments of broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this tilted loop current state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yako ] .",
    "it is possible to find a pdw state that shares the same symmetry properties as the tilted loop current state ( once the sc and cdw orders are removed through fluctuations ) . the simplest way to find such",
    "a state is to allow for the pairing momenta to have a @xmath42-axis component .",
    "the corresponding pdw order parameter has sixteen complex degrees of freedom ( eight for momenta @xmath212 and eight for pdw momenta @xmath213 where the @xmath214 are the momenta considered in section [ sec : in - plane - tetra ] ) .",
    "here we do not present a complete analysis of this order parameter .",
    "however , it is possible to show that the state depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : yako ] is a mean - field ground state and thus represents a viable order parameter . in this state",
    "only four of the pdw momenta have non - zero order parameter components . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : yako ] , two of these momenta lie below the @xmath47-@xmath45 plane and two lie above the @xmath47-@xmath45 plane .",
    "when the sc and cdw order are removed through fluctuations , this state will have the same symmetry properties as the tilted loop - current phase and is therefore also consistent with all existing experiments that show broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in this section we examine whether the broken time-    reversal symmetric pdw states are consistent with arpes measurements . here",
    "we focus our analysis on the tetragonal me pdw state discussed in section vi ( qualitatively similar results will appear for the pdw state discussed in section vii ) . to examine the qp properties , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath215 , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fermion destruction operator with momentum @xmath26 and spin @xmath27",

    "we use the bare dispersion @xmath28 given in ref .   and set @xmath222 ev .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath223 which localizes the pairing in @xmath26 space as described in @xcite ( for @xmath224 , @xmath225 , the other @xmath226 are determined by tetragonal symmetry ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : bands ] and [ fig : bands ] show the bands weighted by a factor @xmath227 for fixed @xmath228 and @xmath229 as a function of @xmath230 ( with @xmath130 ) .",
    "these first two figures show that the fermi arc results from occupied states moving towards the fermi level , a point emphasized in ref .  .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : bands ] we illustrate the role of @xmath231 .",
    "notice that the arpes bands become asymmetric about @xmath232 .",
    "this asymmetry is consistent with existing arpes measurements and it would be of interest to examine this experimentally .",
    "we note that this asymmetry does not exist in the pdw phase proposed in ref .  .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the spectral weight for @xmath233 mev revealing the fermi arcs .",
    "we have shown that pdw order can generate translational invariant me loop current order as a secondary order parameter .",
    "we further show that there exists a pdw ground state with me loop current order , cdw correlations , and qp properties consistent with arpes .",
    "when phase fluctuations are included , a state appears in which only the me loop current order has long - range spatial correlations .",
    "we predict that this state will exhibit short - range incommensurate angular momentum correlations at the same wavevector as the cdw correlations .",
    "we also show that this state gives rise to an asymmetry in the qp properties that may be observed by arpes .",
