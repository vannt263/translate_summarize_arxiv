    "bnl experiments kopio @xcite and e949 @xcite , to search rare kaon decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , require extremely high detection efficiency of charged particles and photons to suppress the dominant background from ordinary kaon decays that are 10 orders of magnitude more frequent . for this purpose",
    "new photon detectors were designed and built .",
    "their common features are the wavelength shifter fiber readout and pb - scintillator sandwich design . in this work we report on the e949 collar endcap photon detector and the kopio photon veto prototype module .",
    "the e949 collar detectors ( co ) are located at the upstream and downstream ends of the detector , outside of the endcaps and near the beam axis .",
    "their purpose is to detect photons emitted from kaon decays in the kaon stopping target under small polar angles .",
    "they cover the very forward region ( from @xmath2 ) as a part of the e949 photon veto system .",
    "the assembly view of downstream co is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collar ] .",
    "the upstream and downstream co are similar in design , the difference is in the geometrical size . the co consist of 25 layers of 5  mm thick scintillator bc404 ( bicron , @xcite ) and 24 layers of 2  mm lead absorber interleaved by 0.1  mm tyvek reflector paper .",
    "the total radiation thickness is limited by available space to @xmath3 .",
    "a single plastic scintillator layer is segmented in 12 wedges ( petals ) forming 12 identical azimuthal sectors .",
    "the petal length is 165  mm .",
    "light from the petals is read out by 16 multiclad wave length shifting ( wls ) fibers ( bcf99 - 29aa from bicron ) which are glued into grooves in the scintillator to obtain a high light yield  @xcite .",
    "the grooves diverge radially along a petal with average spacing of 6  mm .",
    "the inner end of the fiber is polished and aluminized .",
    "all 400 fibers for each sector are bent under angle of 90@xmath4 and terminated in a connector .",
    "fiber length is variable with an average of about 45  cm .",
    "each absorber layer is composed of two halves of a 2  mm thick lead semicircular annular disk .",
    "the pb layers are laid out with a rotation angle of 30@xmath4 relative to the neighboring layer , providing coverage of the cracks between the pb halves in subsequent layers .",
    "the gaps between scintillator petals are also staggered so that there is no projective cracks for photons over the co face .",
    "the sandwich assembly is compressed between a base plate and an endplate disk by 12 standoffs .",
    "the standoffs prevent the collar elements from shifting down due to gravity .",
    "the scintillator petals were cut from cast sheets of bc404 scintillator with 0.1  mm tolerance .",
    "since the sheet has significant thickness variation ( range from 4.8 to 5.2  mm ) , petals were hand selected in groups of similar thickness .",
    "the petals from the same group were laid out to form a single layer .",
    "sixteen symmetrically spaced u - shaped grooves were cut along the petal and polished .",
    "gluing was done in two steps .",
    "first , the grooves were filled with bc-600 epoxy , and the 65  cm long fibers were inserted . in the second step ,",
    "the glue was applied over the fibers to fill any remaining gaps .",
    "the scintillator is etched in a process that results in the formation of a micropore reflector deposit over the surface .",
    "long term effect of pb diffusion in the chemical reflector is unknown so tyvek sheets were used to separate the scintillator and lead .",
    "the tyvek also works as a reflector over the fibers .",
    "the most critical point in the collar assembly is the insertion of the fibers in the connector . before gluing all fibers",
    "were visually inspected and then bent over a cylinder with diameter of 5  cm to expose cracks .",
    "the failure rate ( a fiber is broken ) is below 0.5% .",
    "if bicron fiber was bent with a radius of less than 3  cm , the crazing of the cladding was observed to develop in the curved part for some fibers .",
    "this process takes place in a hour and continues over 2448 hrs .",
    "after that stabilization is observed ( no additional crazing after 48 hours ) .",
    "the fibers were routed to a connector with a bending radius of 4  cm or larger .",
    "even so some fibers show crazing which is not harmful as long as the number of such fibers is less than 1% .",
    "then the fibers have been glued in the connector , the ends were cut and polished .",
    "a view of the assembled collar detector is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : collar_photo ] .",
    "the detector was tested with cosmic rays .",
    "the trigger counters were placed above and below each sector . though the area of the trigger counters is larger than that of a sector , the 50  cm separation selects minimum ionizing particles ( mip ) with incident angles close to normal .",
    "a mip deposits about 25  mev of visible energy in the detector .",
    "a phototube is attached to the fiber connector through a silicone cookie .",
    "all sectors were measured with the same photomultiplier emi-9954 which has a photocathode sensitivity extended in the green light region .",
    "the average number of detected photoelectrons ( p.e . ) is calculated by dividing the mip peak position by the single electron peak position .",
    "an attenuator was used to scale the large mip signal to the single electron amplitude .",
    "the cosmic test results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : collar_ly ] .",
    "[ fig : collar_ly ]    average light yield is about 43  p.e./mev , where mev is visible energy .",
    "deviation from this value in different sectors is @xmath53  p.e .",
    ", this is within the accuracy of the single electron peak calibration .",
    "one of the most important parts of the bnl experiment kopio is the determination that nothing other than single @xmath6 was emitted in the decay @xmath0 , i.e. a high efficiency veto of any extra particles .",
    "it requires an extremely high photon detection efficiency of better than 0.9996 per photon , without excessive loss from random vetoes .",
    "high light yield over all detector volume and good timing are needed to satisfy these requirements .",
    "lead  plastic scintillator sandwich detector is being considered for the barrel photon veto in kopio . to read light from the scintillators , an embedded wls fiber readout will be used .",
    "similar detectors were designed for bnl experiment e787  @xcite ( without wls fibers ) and kek experiment e391  @xcite .",
    "thickness of the lead sheets is considered to be 0.51.0  mm , and the thickness of extruded polystyrene scintillator slabs is 7  mm .",
    "wls fibers are glued in the grooves which run along the scintillator slabs with spacing of 10  mm .",
    "the schematic view of the barrel veto is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : barrel_view ] .",
    "the results of tests of single extruded counters and a sandwich module prototype are reported in ref .",
    "the main results for extruded counters with wls fiber readout are summarized in table  [ table : counters ] .    .",
    "parameters of extruded polystyrene counters with 4.3  m long wls fiber readout . fibers : multi  clad bcf99 - 29aa and single  clad bcf92 of 1  mm diameter . a counter made of bc404 scintillator",
    "is also shown for comparison . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : performance ]    visible energy fraction for 1  mm lead and 7  mm scintillator is about 0.39 . from test results we evaluate the photoyield to be 4.0  p.e .",
    "per mev of the energy deposited in both active ( scintillator ) and passive ( lead ) layers .",
    "it means we can collect 400 p.e . for a typical 100  mev photon . extrapolating the parameters obtained for the prototype module ,",
    "the time resolution of the veto detector is estimated to be close to 200  ps ( rms ) for a 100  mev photon .",
    "direct extrapolation for higher energies gives 63  ps/@xmath7}$ ] .",
    "however , at 1  gev the time resolution includes not only stochastic term but also the systematic constant term , which is difficult to estimate .",
    "since the light propagation velocity in the fibers was measured to be 17  cm / ns , the accuracy of a localization of an electromagnetic shower could be about 3.4  cm ( rms ) along the fibers for a 100  mev photon .",
    "the resolution in the other direction is defined by the width of the modules . for a 130  mm width",
    "we have @xmath8=3.8  cm .",
    "we are able to recover the shower direction measuring the center - of - gravity at each level and drawing the line through these centers by @xmath9 method .",
    "this method gives the systematic shift which was corrected .",
    "we simulated the photons irradiated from the center of the decay region under angles in uniform populated range from 45 to 135@xmath4 .",
    "angular resolution of 244  mrad ( @xmath10=100  mev ) for a typical angle of 70@xmath4 leads to the measurement of the @xmath11 decay position with an accuracy of about 40  cm .",
    "photon veto detectors for bnl experiment e949 were manufactured and tested with cosmic rays .",
    "the detectors consist of 25 layers of 5 mm thick scintillator bc404 and 24 layers of 2 mm lead absorber .",
    "readout is implemented with multi ",
