    "baryon physics in holographic setups has been addressed since the time the first holographic qcd models have been developed .",
    "there is a wealth of works related to the interpretation of the baryon as a holographic instanton @xcite , the qcd currents sourced by the baryon @xcite and even high - density baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "unfortunately though , the studies of the interplay between baryon physics and physics of chiral symmetry breaking is undeservedly rare : ref.@xcite is the only example that we are aware of . but from the other hand these relationships remain one of the longstanding questions in qcd @xcite and should be definitely addressed with the new tools provided by the holographic duality , which proved to be useful in describing both chiral symmetry breaking and baryons in qcd .",
    "usually the ads / qcd model , which is used for the studies of baryons , is ( a modification of ) the sakai - sugimoto model ( ss ) @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the system of @xmath0 @xmath1 branes , which are embedded in the curved hyperbolic space produced by a stack of @xmath2 @xmath3 branes .",
    "one of the dimensions , @xmath4 , is compact and serves for breaking supersymmetry .",
    "the compactification radius of @xmath4 vanishes at some point and thus the background space has the shape of a cigar @xcite .",
    "the location of the tip of the cigar plays the role of the @xmath5 scale . from the holographic point of view , the tip serves as a boundary beyond which nothing can propagate as the space practically ends there .",
    "the @xmath1 branes embedded in this background are located at the opposite ( or almost opposite @xcite ) points of the @xmath4-circle and consequently they merge together when the circle collapses .",
    "the gauge field , @xmath6 , which is a massless mode of the open string with two ends connected to the @xmath7 branes , belongs to the adjoint representation of the flavor group @xmath8 and is dual to the quark current operator of qcd .",
    "one can introduce the coordinate @xmath9 along the branes with the origin on the tip of the cigar , which goes from  @xmath10 on the @xmath7 brane to @xmath11 on the @xmath12 brane .",
    "the values of the gauge field @xmath6 at @xmath10 may be thought of as being coupled to the left quark current @xmath13 while the values at @xmath14 are coupled to the right current @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly one can call the @xmath7 branes left and the @xmath12 branes right .",
    "the baryon in the sakai - sugimoto model is an instanton of the field @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the baryon charge equals the topological charge of the instanton because the baryon current is sourced in the chern - simons ( cs ) term of the action by a topological charge density .",
    "one can find that the instanton in the ss model is well approximated by the usual flat bpst instanton .",
    "this holds because the size of the instanton is parametrically small ; the center of the solution is located on the tip of the cigar and one can neglect the curvature of the metric at the scale of the solution radius .",
    "the vanishing difference between spatial ( @xmath16 ) and holographic ( @xmath9 ) parts of the metric leads to an approximate @xmath17 symmetry group of the space @xcite . in this setting",
    "it is very convenient to use the usual radial ansatz of the bpst instanton with the radial coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "the solution is then located at @xmath19 .    for our purposes , though , the sakai - sugimoto model is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "the obstacle is that it is not at all easy to describe chiral symmetry breaking and the associated chiral condensate in this setup .",
    "this problem was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite and it was shown that the holographic field dual to the scalar quark current @xmath20 is a tachyonic mode of the string stretched between the @xmath7 and the @xmath12 branes .",
    "the tachyonic field condenses on the tip of the cigar , thus providing a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath20 , the chiral condensate .",
    "there are , however , several complications in this setup .",
    "the construction of the tachyonic dbi action is ambiguous , the backreaction of the condensed open string on the geometry of space should be taken into account and so on . on top of that , when constructing an effective 5-dimensional holographic model for mesons it is impossible to treat the open string as a local field .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking is relatively easy to implement in the other , `` bottom - up '' , approach of holographic qcd . instead of constructing the brane system which would reproduce the effective theory of mesons , one builds the model by including the fields , dual to the qcd operators , in the 5-dimensional ads background @xcite . in the `` hard - wall '' ( hw ) model @xcite",
    "the space ends on the wall located at a finite value of the holographic coordinate @xmath21 .",
    "this wall ( we will call it the ir wall ) serves the same purpose as the tip of the cigar in the ss model by breaking conformal symmetry and providing the scale @xmath5 .",
    "there are * two * gauge fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are dual to left and right quark currents . the field , which is dual to the scalar quark operator @xmath20 , is just a bifundamental scalar @xmath24 .",
    "its vacuum profile is described by the two parameters @xmath25 which by the holographic dictionary @xcite are related to the quark mass @xmath26 and condensate ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and the derivation in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] ) @xmath27 in the model there is no internal mechanism , which would fix the value of the chiral condensate .",
    "instead one obtains a nonzero value of @xmath28 by imposing a dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath24 at the ir wall @xmath29 one can obtain the correlation functions of various operators in the setup with nonzero profile of the bifundamental scalar and study the dependence of various observables on the chiral condensate , which is just a parameter of the model .",
    "unfortunately , the treatment of the baryon in this setup is not as straightforward as it is in the ss model .",
    "there are two gauge fields , which should realize the topologically nontrivial solution , and on top of that , there is a scalar with a nonzero vev , which interacts with both of them .",
    "one should also pay special attention to the boundary conditions at the ir boundary , as they are arbitrary in the construction and should be additionally fixed in the model .",
    "concerning the baryon , the question of ir boundary condition becomes substantially important because the corresponding topological soliton falls on the ir wall , a phenomenon similar to the localization of the ss - instanton on the tip of the cigar .",
    "the baryon physics in hw model without a chiral condensate was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bifundamental scalar was included in ref .",
    "@xcite , however the dependence of the baryon mass on the condensate has not been investigated .",
    "motivated by the formula derived using the qcd sum rules in ref .",
    "@xcite two of us have analyzed the baryon - mass origin in the framework of the hard wall model @xcite and found that at large values of the chiral condensate , there are clear indications that it dominates .",
    "however the accuracy of the numerical calculations was not high enough to make precise claims . in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the different aspects of the impact of the chiral symmetry breaking on the baryon solution .",
    "we will clearly see the internal structure of the solution and two regimes in the dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce our setup , which we try to keep sufficiently general and applicable to a wide range of holographic qcd models .",
    "we study the qualitative structure of the baryon solution in the presence of the chiral scalar field in sec .",
    "[ sec : structure ] .",
    "the quantitative support for this treatment is given by the numerical solution in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] .",
    "[ sec : mass ] and [ sec : form ] are devoted to the calculation of the baryon mass and local mean values of the qcd currents in presence of the baryon .",
    "we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the analysis of the precision of our numerics is outlined in the appendix .",
    "it is actually possible to make a qualitative connection between the seemingly different setups of the sakai - sugimoto and the `` hard wall '' models . in order to build up our intuition",
    "we use the following `` folding trick '' : consider the cigar - bended @xmath7 brane of the ss model .",
    "there is a single gauge field @xmath6 on this brane , but let us call it @xmath22 when it is considered on the left brane and @xmath23 on the right brane ( see fig.[folding ] ) . on the tip of the cigar @xmath30 , of course .",
    "next , let us assume trivial dynamics along the @xmath4 direction , which will allow us to neglect the separation of the branes along @xmath4 altogether , effectively `` folding '' the cigar - shaped brane into a single sheet .",
    "more specifically , we cut the brane along the tip or @xmath31 line .",
    "on one side we have the @xmath22 field and @xmath32 and on the other side the @xmath23 field and @xmath33 $ ] . in order to get consistent coordinates ,",
    "we perform a @xmath34 transformation on the right brane , which also means @xmath35 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the inverse holographic coordinate @xmath36 .",
    "then the tip of the cigar ( @xmath31 ) corresponds to the maximum @xmath37 and the boundary values are assigned at @xmath38 . at the end of the day we have two gauge fields propagating on a strip @xmath39 $ ] , which is qualitatively the same as in the hw model .",
    "the important additional information , that we get here , is the boundary conditions on the gauge fields at the ir boundary . because we know that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the same field there , we get @xmath40 in this picture the tachyonic string , which was responsible for the chiral condensate in the ss model , collapses to the local bifundamental tachyonic scalar @xmath24 .",
    "the ss baryon , which was originally located at @xmath31 , is now split into two halves , one composed of @xmath22 and the other of @xmath23 , which are folded together .",
    "thus we expect that in the hw model , the baryon would appear as one half of the instanton lying on the ir wall .",
    "scheme of the `` folding trick '' explained in the text . ]    as we see , in any case the holographic qcd model with two quark flavors @xmath41 can be described by dynamics of left ( @xmath22 ) and right ( @xmath23 ) gauge fields of the group @xmath42 and a bifundamental tachyonic scalar @xmath24 in 5-dimensional curved space .",
    "we use hermitian gauge - group generators and treat the gauge connection as hermitian matrices$ ] ] : @xmath43= i \\epsilon^{abc } t^c.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the background space can be described by the mostly - minus metric of the general form as it usually stands for euclidean time and our treatment is minkowskian . for the holographic coordinate we use @xmath45 instead to avoid possible confusion . ]",
    "@xmath46 for instance , in the `` hard - wall '' model @xcite @xmath47 ; in sakai - sugimoto model @xcite @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is a curvature scale and the holographic coordinate @xmath50 is bounded from above : @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the yang - mills action is @xmath52 where the covariant derivative is @xmath53 and the gauge coupling @xmath54 and normalization of the scalar @xmath55 are to be fixed by phenomenology @xcite or a specific top - down construction @xcite is inversely proportional to the t hooft coupling of the dual field theory , which is assumed to be large . ] .",
    "the mass of the scalar @xmath56 is defined by the dimension of the corresponding operator @xmath57 and equals @xmath58 .",
    "the chern - simons term is present as well @xmath59 one can immediately spot that the non - abelian part of the gauge field , which has nonzero topological charge in the 4-dimensional spacelike slice , provides a source for the temporal component of the abelian field , which is dual to the baryon current .",
    "thus we can identify the baryon charge of a given field configuration @xcite @xmath60    in order to construct the solution in the 4d spacelike @xmath61-plane we adopt the cylindrical ansatz proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , taking @xmath62 and @xmath50 as the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the 4d gauge potentials are parametrized by all possible tensor structures which link the spatial and @xmath63 group indices .",
    "it is convenient to work with the vector and axial combinations , defined as @xmath64 in order to preserve 3d parity , we choose the p - odd and p - even tensors for the spatial components of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the time and @xmath50 components should be parity even for @xmath67 and odd for @xmath68 .",

    "@xmath86 one should note though that the baryon , which is a solution with @xmath87 , should have the phase @xmath85 winding by @xmath88 .",
    "hence the baryon in our model is a * half - vortex * .. the only way a half - vortex can be realized as a smooth solution is by having its core located on one of the boundaries .",

    "( [ potentials ] ) does not allow @xmath75 to deviate from 1 either at @xmath90 or at @xmath38 where @xmath91 is singular .",
    "the core can not be located at infinity as well , because this will require a nonzero derivative @xmath92 at @xmath80 and lead to a divergence in energy due to the @xmath75 kinetic term ( [ kin_eta ] ) .",

    ". therefore , if @xmath85 has a winding @xmath88 , the same holds true for @xmath94 and the scalar @xmath76 realizes a * half - vortex * as well .",
    "the location of the core of this vortex is different though . at infinity",
    "we need to connect the baryon solution with the vacuum , where the profile of the @xmath24 field is given by the quark mass and condensate ( [ vac_x ] ) , thus the modulus @xmath76 can not vanish . the core can not be located at @xmath38 as well , because according the holographic dictionary the boundary value of @xmath76 is defined by the source of the corresponding operator , which is the quark mass . on the ir wall",
    ", @xmath76 is fixed by the boundary condition ( [ bc_x ] ) which defines the quark condensate . at the end of the day",
    ", the only remaining place for the core of the @xmath76 half - vortex is * the center of the soliton * @xmath90 .",
    "schematic structure of the soliton . @xmath96",
    " half - vortices of @xmath75 and @xmath76 scalars .",
    "arrows show the effective forces produced by the metric ( @xmath97 ) , kinetic terms of @xmath76 and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and self interaction with the abelian field in the cs - term . ]    at this point we see that the holographic baryon is a soliton consisting of two interacting half - vortices of two scalar fields .",
    "one is located on the ir wall and another at the center of the soliton ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) .",
    "now it is important to consider the energy of the solution and ensure that there exists a mechanism which stabilizes its size , preventing the soliton from collapsing .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that due to the metric factors @xmath100 the energy of the soliton is roughly inversely proportional to its @xmath50 position .",
    "hence the solution tends to lie at the largest possible @xmath101 . in other words ,",
    "the metric provides a force , which * pulls the solution to the ir wall*.    on the other hand , due to the ir boundary condition on @xmath24 , the core of the @xmath76 vortex can not approach ir wall too close .",
    "this would lead to a large gradient of @xmath76 , which evolves from zero in the core to @xmath102 on the wall .",
    "hence the kinetic term of @xmath76 ( [ kin_chi ] ) and ir boundary condition ( [ bc_x ] ) provide a counterforce , which * repels the solution from the wall*.    one can see though that this counterforce is proportional to the radius of the solution squared .",
    "therefore it becomes negligible when the size of the soliton is small .",
    "moreover , the whole @xmath76 energy term ( [ kin_chi ] ) is proportional to @xmath103 , so it contributes ( in addition to the gauge field kinetic term ( [ sym ] ) ) to the pressure , which would * shrink * the solution to zero size . weakens and can not prevent further shrinking . ]",
    "it is known @xcite that the important counterforce to this shrinking , which stabilizes the radius of the solution , is provided by the interaction of the soliton with the abelian gauge field via the chern - simons term ( [ scs ] ) .",
    "the smaller the radius of the solution becomes , the higher the density of topological charge is , which sources the temporal component of the vector abelian field , and the larger its gradient is .",
    "this results in the effective * internal pressure * which fixes the size of the soliton ( see fig.[scheme ] ) .",
    "this treatment shows an interesting effect , which is produced by the chiral scalar field in the `` hard - wall '' model .",
    "once the soliton radius is fixed by the cs term , the ir boundary condition ( [ bc_x ] ) together with the @xmath76 kinetic term ( [ kin_chi ] ) produce the force which repels the soliton from the ir wall .",
    "the larger the chiral condensate is , the stronger the repulsion is . at large enough values of @xmath28",
    ", this repulsion will define the equilibrium @xmath50 coordinate of the soliton center and therefore , will directly affect its energy . hence one should expect a substantial dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate . in the sakai - sugimoto model , though , the radius of the soliton is inversely proportional to the t hooft coupling and is therefore parametrically small @xcite .",
    "this renders the repulsive force parametrically small as well and consequently it is questionable whether in the sakai - sugimoto model any impact of the chiral condensate on the baryon mass can be observed .",
    "in order to confirm the expectations outlined above we construct the soliton solution numerically . for the numerical simulation we choose the `` hard - wall '' model , so the metric is unperturbed ads@xmath104 : @xmath105 , and the scalar asymptotic profile",
    "is given by eq .",

    "the phase @xmath85 changes by @xmath88 along the boundary of space .",
    "we can chose the gauge in such a way that the total winding occurs along the @xmath115 boundary , where @xmath85 changes linearly @xmath116 and it is constant everywhere except the jump by @xmath88 in the core of the @xmath75 half - vortex on the ir boundary .",
    "this choice of @xmath85 ensures us that @xmath117 at @xmath38 , hence there are no source terms for the axial current , @xmath118 at infinity , hence the currents decay there , and @xmath119 on the ir wall which is required by the ir condition ( [ bc_ir ] ) . due to the interaction between the scalars @xmath76 and @xmath75 ( [ phase_lock ] ) ,",
    "the phase difference @xmath120 should be either @xmath121 or @xmath122 on all the boundaries .",
    "therefore the phase @xmath94 winds linearly along the @xmath115 boundary as well : @xmath123 .",

    "one can check that this choice of phase guarantees the constant value of the quark mass @xmath26 at @xmath38 .    the pure gauge condition at @xmath80 will then fix @xmath112 to be a constant : @xmath124 . hence according to the lorenz gauge , we get @xmath125 . as we discussed in the introduction , on the ir boundary @xmath126 due to the merging of the left and",
    "right branes at this point ( [ bc_ir ] ) .",
    "this does not apply though to the @xmath50 component and thus the gauge condition will take the form @xmath127 .",

    "in this paper we have studied the interplay between chiral symmetry breaking and the baryon in a holographic qcd setup .",
    "although the numerical calculations were done for a specific `` hard - wall '' model , our qualitative treatment is fairly general and the results should hold for a generic model .",
    "we have proved in a clear - cut manner the conjecture advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite that there are essentially two regimes in baryon physics where the dependence of the baryon mass on the chiral condensate is very different .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the physical value of the baryon mass is in the transition region between the two regimes , which clearly demonstrates that the ioffe s formula for the baryon mass @xcite derived in qcd sum rules is relevant .",
    "the main finding of our work is the phenomenon of repulsion of the baryon from the ir wall due to the interaction with the scalar field dual to the chiral condensate .",
    "it is very important to understand how this repulsion looks from the perspective of the sakai - sugimoto setup . at large values of the chiral condensate the baryon",
    "is moved away from the tip of the cigar .",
    "the only way to do this without violating p - symmetry is to _ split _ the soliton into two symmetric halves .",
    "one of them is moved to the left brane and another to the right one . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "these two halves carry equal half - integer baryon charges and opposite half - integer abelian axial charges , producing in total the solution with unit baryon charge .    in spirit",
    "the splitting of the holographic baryon is very similar to the splitting of an instanton on compact space into monopoles .",
    "this phenomenon takes place when the system is considered at finite temperature or finite chemical potential .",
    "however , the details can be very different and deserve a thorough study .",
    "in particular it is not completely clear how the splitting occurs in terms of the branes .",
    "the baryon is represented by the d4 brane wrapped around the internal sphere @xmath171 and can not be naively split into half d4 branes .",
    "the process could be viewed upon a t - duality transformation around the compact coordinate on the cigar .",
    "another delicate issue concerns the behavior at the nonvanishing temperature .",
    "different scenarios of the splitting phenomenon could take place once one takes into account the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate .",
    "we should recall , that once one moves from the tip of the cigar , the separation between @xmath7 and @xmath12 branes grows with the radius of the compact circle @xmath4 . in our treatment",
    "we neglected this separation in favor of the opportunity of working with the 5d model with local fields , but in a general setup once the baryon is split and repelled from the tip of the cigar this separation may lead to interesting phenomena .",
    "for example , although the net abelian axial charge of the solution is zero , the axial dipole moment is nonzero and proportional to the size of the @xmath4-circle .",
    "the @xmath85- dependence of the skyrmion due to the splitting can be considered in the ss model as well since the @xmath85-term corresponds to the holonomy of the one - form rr field along the compact coordinate on the cigar .",
    "one should note though , that the splitting effect is proportional to the size of the instanton and therefore is parametrically suppressed by the t hooft coupling in the original sakai - sugimoto model . on the other hand , the divergent tachyonic mode of the open string can provide a sufficiently large scalar boundary value , which will render the effect sizable .",
    "given these subtleties , it is not clear in which particular setup one should study the phenomena mentioned above .    the other interesting",
    "finding , that we made in the present study , is the backreaction of the baryon solution on the local density of the quark bilinear operator .",
    "we find that the chiral condensate gets suppressed inside the baryon and the chiral symmetry is partially restored .",
    "this idea was widely discussed in the literature but to our knowledge this phenomenon has not been directly observed in any models of qcd .",
    "the chiral condensate in the ss model follows from tachyon condensation on the string , hence it would be interesting to investigate the impact of the skyrmion on the tachyon action directly .",
    "this could also be related to the recent discussion of the spectrum of hadrons including baryons in terms of the details of the dirac operator spectrum in qcd @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge the contribution of peter kopnin during the early stages of this project .",
    "we benefited from the discussions with paul sutcliffe , daniel arean and nick evans .",

    "we perform our numerical analysis using two different methods implemented in different codes in order to exclude any possible systematic errors ( see text ) .",
    "the mass and topological charge distribution of the soliton is calculated on the grids @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "one can observe a good convergence of the results ( see fig .",
    "[ prec_m ] ) and the estimated precision of the finest grid is within 1% .",
    "it is numerically challenging to calculate the axial charge ( [ axial_formfactors ] ) .",
    "the mean value of the axial current is defined by the asymptotic form of the solution near the boundary @xmath175 .",
    "the equations of motion are singular on this boundary , hence the precision of the calculated solution should be higher than @xmath176 . on top of that , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ axial_formfactors ] ) has several factors of @xmath177 and in order to get finite results one needs to ensure that the fall off of the solution at large @xmath177 is calculated with a precision of order @xmath178 .",
    "an additional difficulty is the fact that we impose nontrivial boundary conditions at @xmath115 .",
    "because of that , the accuracy of the solution at @xmath80 is limited by the precision of the finite difference approximation of the scalar field derivatives on the grid . at the end of the day we are forced to use very dense grids in the @xmath50 direction in order to obtain convergent integrals for @xmath164 .",
