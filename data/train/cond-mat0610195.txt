    "further evidence for a dynamic length scale comes from experiments done in thin films or small pores @xcite , but these experiments are unable to directly observe the nature of any correlated motion .",

    "we use a confocal microscope to track the motions of several thousand particles for several hours , long enough for most particles to undergo nontrivial displacements .",
    "the mobilities of these particles ( the magnitudes of their displacements ) are correlated over distances of @xmath3 , in terms of the particle diameter @xmath1 .",
    "these correlations reflect large - scale cooperative rearrangements of particles seen previously @xcite .",
    "we also examine the correlations between the directions of particle displacements .",
    "while the directions are correlated , this does not appear to be as strong a signature of the rearrangements .",
    "these measurements are direct experimental studies of the nature of the long - range correlations present near a glass transition , and indicate that rearranging regions of particles are composed of particles with large displacements , but which do not all move in similar directions ; rather , these regions are internally rearranging @xcite .",
    "our system consists of a suspension of colloidal poly - methyl - methacrylate , sterically stabilized and dyed with a rhodamine dye @xcite .",
    "these particles are slightly charged , and have a hard - sphere diameter @xmath4 @xmath5 m and a polydispersity of 5% .",

    "we use confocal microscopy to observe the particle motion .",
    "a single three - dimensional image is acquired in 10  s , and over the course of an experiment we acquire several hundred images . as the mean square displacement curves show in figure [ fig - dt](a ) , particles do not move significant distances on a time scale of 10 s. we post - process the data to determine particle positions with an accuracy of 0.03 @xmath5 m horizontally and 0.05 @xmath5 m vertically @xcite .",

    "these curves all show a plateau , due to cage - trapping : each particle is confined in a cage formed by its neighbors . at longer times",
    ", @xmath16 shows an upturn , indicating that at least some particles have moved . for the supercooled fluids ( thick lines , @xmath17 ) , previous work showed that these motions correspond to a small subset of particles undergoing cage rearrangements @xcite .",
    "these particles move significantly farther than the majority of the particles , and thus distributions of the particle displacements show broad tails at these time scales @xcite .",
    "this is quantifiable by the nongaussian parameter @xmath18 where the moments of @xmath19 are calculated from the measured distributions of the one - dimensional displacements @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is zero for a gaussian , and larger when the distributions are broader than a gaussian .",
    "we plot @xmath20 in figure [ fig - dt](b ) , finding that for supercooled fluids ( thick lines ) @xmath20 has a peak corresponding to the end of the plateau of @xmath21 , due to the presence of the anomalously mobile particles @xcite . for colloidal glasses [ thin lines in figure [ fig - dt](a ) ] ,",
    "the upturn in @xmath21 is due to aging , and occurs at a time scale @xmath22 which varies with the time since sample preparation @xcite .",
    "it is unclear if the motions responsible for the upturn are due to cage rearrangements @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , in supercooled colloidal fluids , the motion of these cage - rearranging particles is spatially localized , and the peak of @xmath23 corresponds to the existence of large clusters of these particles all moving simultaneously @xcite .",
    "in fact , the positions of mobile particles appear in localized clusters over a range of time scales @xmath22 , and the @xmath22 dependence of the typical cluster size appears qualitatively similar to the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we wish to determine how these previously observed clusters of cage - rearranging particles are manifested in correlations of the motion of individual particles . in a dilute suspension of particles",
    ", particles have only hydrodynamic interactions , and the correlations between the displacement vectors @xmath24 of two particles should decay as @xmath25 with increasing separation @xmath26 @xcite",
    ". this result would still hold true for dilute tracers in any homogeneous viscoelastic medium @xcite .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that our samples are homogeneous on the length scales we consider ; our imaging window has a width of only @xmath27 particle diameters .",
    "the direct interparticle forces ( their electric charge , and steric repulsion ) are likely to be as important as hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "thus , we do not necessarily expect @xmath25 decay of correlations , especially given the apparently cooperative and localized nature of the cage rearrangement motion .",
    "for example , a simulation of hard spheres at large volume fractions found exponential decay @xcite .",
    "this suggests particles may rearrange by translating together in a group .",
    "one possibility for this group motion is that cage rearranging particles move in parallel directions @xcite .",
    "an alternate possibility is that _ mobility _ may be correlated over long distances .",
    "mobility is the magnitude of particle displacements @xmath28 , sometimes with the average subtracted off ( @xmath29 ) . in fact , the previous observations of clusters of anomalously mobile particles are a direct indication that mobility is correlated ; simulations have provided evidence that there is a correlation length scale @xcite . correlations of mobility are consistent with both collectively translating regions , and also internal rearrangements within localized regions .    to study these possibilities ,",
    "we compute two correlation functions from our data , one using @xmath24 and one using the mobility @xmath30 @xcite . we define @xmath31 where the time scale @xmath22 is used to define the displacements @xmath24 and mobility @xmath30 . for both formulas",
    "the numerator average is over all pairs of particles @xmath32 with separations @xmath26 , and the denominator average is over all particles @xcite .",
    "the normalization of both of these functions is chosen so that perfectly correlated motion ( @xmath33 for all particles @xmath32 ) corresponds to @xmath34 , perfectly anticorrelated motion ( @xmath35 ) corresponds to @xmath36 , and uncorrelated motion gives @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 measures _ fluctuations _ of mobility , so either anomalously mobile or anomalously immobile particles would show positive correlation . by examining the @xmath26 dependence of these functions we learn about spatially correlated motion , and by examining the @xmath22 dependence we study the correlated motion seen at different time scales .",
    "to study the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath39 and @xmath38 , for convenience we choose a fixed value @xmath40 for each data set , set by the first maximum of the pair correlation function @xmath2 ( which is slightly larger than at @xmath41 , and depends slightly on @xmath6 , due to the charging of the particles ) .",
    "pairs of particles with separation @xmath42 are nearest neighbors and are strongly correlated due to their close proximity , as will be shown later .",
    "we plot @xmath43 in figure [ fig - dt](c ) and @xmath44 in figure [ fig - dt](d ) . for the supercooled fluids ( thick lines ) ,",
    "the behaviour of these two functions is dramatically different .",
    "@xmath39 is nearly constant as a function of @xmath22 , whereas @xmath38 is small at short lag times , rises to a maximum , and then has a downturn .",
    "strikingly , the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath45 is similar to that of the nongaussian parameter @xmath20 , which can be seen for three supercooled fluid samples by comparing the thick lines in figure [ fig - dt](b ) and figure [ fig - dt](d ) .",
    "while @xmath38 reaches its maximum at slightly larger values of @xmath22 , it appears that the anomalously mobile particles ( which cause the increase of @xmath20 ) are directly responsible for the increasing correlation measured by @xmath38 .",
    "while the time dependence of the vectorial correlations @xmath39 is much weaker than for the mobility , there is a slight rise at larger @xmath22 seen in figure [ fig - dt](c ) @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured that @xmath46 should be nonzero , as short - lag - time interparticle correlations will always provide a contribution to @xmath47 even if particles are uncorrelated at longer lag times @xcite .",
    "this may explain why we do not see a downturn in @xmath39 at large @xmath22 .",
    "figures [ fig - dt](c , d ) also show that at short lag times , @xmath48 , although at the cage - breaking time scales , the opposite is true .",
    "these results , along with the similar lag time dependence of @xmath20 and @xmath38 , suggest that the cage rearrangements are due to mobility correlations , rather than a strong directional correlation .",
    "the implied picture is that regions of cage rearrangements are composed of highly mobile particles , which move in many directions .",
    "while the motions of neighboring particles are somewhat directionally correlated , the cage rearrangements reflect regions of internal restructuring rather than large - scale cooperative translations .",
    "further confirmation of this picture comes from the volume fraction dependence of the correlation functions , seen in figure [ fig - dt](c , d ) .",
    "as @xmath6 increases towards the glass transition at @xmath49 , @xmath50 changes only slightly , while @xmath38 changes dramatically , again similar to the behaviour of @xmath20 .",
    "the growth of @xmath38 ( and non - growth of @xmath50 ) indicate that as the glass transition is approached , mobility correlations become increasingly important , while the directional correlations remain virtually unchanged .",
    "= 8truecm    the results are harder to interpret for glassy samples ( thin lines in figure [ fig - dt ] ) , due to the aging of the system . in an aging system ,",
    "the properties of the samples depend on the time since the sample was prepared @xcite ; for example , the increase in @xmath51 at large @xmath52 [ figure [ fig - dt](a ) ] moves to longer @xmath22 as the sample age increases .",
    "( the sample age is defined as the time since stirring the sample prior to the start of the experiment . to minimize the effects of aging for these data , data acquisition was started 5 - 10 hours after stirring the sample , which reliably initiates the aging @xcite . )",
    "as seen in figure [ fig - dt](c , d ) , any @xmath6 dependence for the correlated behaviour in glassy samples is unclear .",
    "the correlation functions are nonzero due to correlated motion of particles within cages ; however , the increases seen in @xmath39 and @xmath38 at large @xmath22 are probably due to the slight motions responsible for aging @xcite .    to examine the spatial character of the highly correlated particles occurring at the cage - rearrangement time scales , we study the @xmath26 dependence of these functions fixing @xmath22 to maximize @xmath38 [ figure [ fig - dt](d ) ] .",
    "the correlation functions are shown for a supercooled fluid ( @xmath53 ) in figure [ fig - dr](a ) , indicated by the thick lines .",
    "both functions oscillate , with especially strong oscillations seen in @xmath39 ( thick solid line ) .",
    "strikingly , these oscillations coincide with oscillations of the pair correlation function @xmath2 , shown in figure [ fig - dr](c ) .",
    "for example , pairs of particles with separations corresponding to the first peak in @xmath2 are nearest neighbors , and are the most strongly correlated .",
    "this agrees with our earlier work which found that the pair correlation function @xmath2 influences the motion of pairs of particles @xcite .",
    "in fact , comparing @xmath38 and @xmath39 shows that the correlation of the _ mobility _ of pairs of particles is less sensitive to @xmath2 , whereas the correlation of their _ directions _ is more sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "this is further evidence that cage rearrangements involve regions of particles with high mobility , although within those regions the directions of the displacements of individual particles are not as strongly correlated , but rather are influenced by @xmath2 .",
    "both simulations of lennard - jones particles and of hard spheres saw similar oscillations in spatial correlation functions , but the relationship with @xmath2 was unclear as the systems had higher polydispersity than our samples @xcite .    to further examine the correlations in the directions of motion of pairs of particles , we decompose @xmath39 into longitudinal correlations ( correlations of the displacement along the direction of the separation vector @xmath54 ) and transverse correlations ( correlations of the component of the displacement vector perpendicular to @xmath54 ) .",
    "two new functions are defined as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the normalization is chosen so that @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is a unit vector pointing from particle @xmath62 to particle @xmath63 , and the dot products for the @xmath64 terms are taken so that two vectors pointed in the same direction correlate positively .",
    "these two functions are also plotted in figure [ fig - dr](a ) ( thin lines ) .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath39 are almost entirely due to the contribution from @xmath65 ( thin solid line ) , indicating that the longitudinal motion is most sensitive to @xmath2 . in fact , the longitudinal correlations of the motions of nearest neighbor particle pairs are suggestive of `` string - like '' motion seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath66 also shows a slight anticorrelation at @xmath67 @xmath5 m , corresponding to the first minimum of @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that pairs of particles separated by @xmath68 are actually more likely to move in antiparallel directions ( towards or away from each other ) , despite their strongly correlated mobility .",
    "the transverse component @xmath69 ( thin dotted line ) has a slight increase closer to the first minimum of @xmath2 , but otherwise shows little dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "= 8truecm    at larger separations , particle motion is still less correlated .",
    "if the particles were in a dilute suspension and long range interactions were solely due to the hydrodynamic behaviour of the solvent , the correlation functions should decrease as @xmath25 .",
    "this would also be the case for a homogeneous viscoelastic medium @xcite , although the localized rearrangements observed previously shows that motion in these dense colloidal samples is spatially inhomogeneous @xcite . to check this",
    ", we plot the correlation functions on semilog and log - log axes in figure [ fig - bigdr ] for @xmath53 at two different time scales .",
    "the top right graph shows that the decay is close to @xmath25 for short time scales ; we find similar behaviour for all liquid samples at time scales @xmath70  s. the behaviour characteristic of longer time scales relevant for cage rearrangements is shown in the bottom graphs . on the semilog graph ,",
    "the decays follow straight lines for both functions out to @xmath71  @xmath5 m , indicating exponential decay with characteristic length scales @xmath72  @xmath5 m = @xmath73 and @xmath74  @xmath5 m = @xmath75 .",
    "for this sample , the decay lengths vary in the range @xmath76  @xmath5 m and @xmath77  @xmath5 m when @xmath22 is varied from 50  -  5000  s. the exponential decay demonstrates that for dense colloidal suspensions on these length and time scales are not behaving as continuum viscoelastic materials @xcite .    at large @xmath26",
    ", a downturn is seen in the correlation functions ( bottom graphs in figure [ fig - bigdr ] ) .",
    "this is due to a counterflow , similar to what was seen in simulations @xcite .",
    "this counterflow has been previously interpreted as the medium s response to the transient motion of a particle , although it is less clear how this may apply in the case of localized motions @xcite .",
    "the counterflow may be due to the presence of the coverslip ( @xmath7830  @xmath5 m away ) , although the correlation functions do not change significantly when the data is split into two subsets , one closer to the coverslip and one farther .",
    "the counterflow results in a slight anticorrelation in both @xmath39 and @xmath38 at @xmath79 @xmath5 m ( not shown ) . in all cases",
    "the exponential decay occurs over a decade in @xmath26 before the counterflow cuts off the correlation . at still larger length scales ( @xmath80 )",
    ", the correlation functions must decay as @xmath25 , as on a sufficiently large length scale the colloidal suspension will appear homogeneous .",
    "however , we do not have data at large enough @xmath26 to see @xmath25 decay , and at large separations the amplitude of the correlation functions would be quite small and difficult to measure .",
    "= 8truecm    to look for a possible growing length scale , we extract the correlation decay lengths for @xmath39 and @xmath38 in samples with different volume fractions , with results shown in figure [ fig - phi ] .",
    "the decay lengths increase only slightly as @xmath10 is approached . within the error bars ,",
    "@xmath81 is consistent with a constant value @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 doubles over the range @xmath84 , and this is sufficient to account for the increase in the size of clusters of mobile particles seen seen in previous work @xcite ; however , we see no evidence in our data for or against a divergence of @xmath83 at @xmath10 .",
    "intriguingly , this slight increase in @xmath83 gives new insight into the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath38 for the supercooled fluids , seen in figure [ fig - dt](d ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath85 , we find that the maximum value ( with respect to @xmath22 ) of @xmath86 is a constant , approximately @xmath87 , independent of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the increasing height of @xmath38 as @xmath6 increases , seen in figure [ fig - dt](d ) , is primarily due to the increase in @xmath83 and thus an increasing value of @xmath88 , using the nearest neighbor separation @xmath89 .",
    "we can compare our length scales @xmath81 and @xmath90 with length scales obtained from computer simulations of glass - forming systems .",
    "the values we find for @xmath53 ( @xmath91 ) are slightly larger than that seen in simulations of hard spheres ( @xmath92 ) ; the simulations had a higher polydispersity , and thus may have been farther from the glass transition at @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "simulations of lennard - jones particles did not notice exponential decay , and instead computed a length scale by calculating ( in our notation ) @xmath93 the term in parenthesis is qualitatively similar to the nongaussian parameter @xmath20 , and over the range of liquids shown in figure [ fig - phi ] varies from 0.35 ( at @xmath94 ) to 0.70 ( at @xmath53 ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath95 for our data by using the form @xmath96 for @xmath38 with our measured values for @xmath97 and @xmath83 , and using the value of @xmath22 which maximizes @xmath38 ( and thus maximizes @xmath95 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath95 increases from 0.9 - 4.1 @xmath5 m @xmath98 as the glass transition is approached .",
    "these values are larger than those seen in the simulation ( 0.05 - 0.32 in lennard - jones units ) @xcite .",
    "earlier work has seen evidence that structural properties of the sample are slightly correlated with particle mobility @xcite .",
    "this then suggests that the exponential length scales seen in the correlation functions may relate to spatial correlations of structural properties .",
    "we have computed a spatial correlation function @xmath99 similar to @xmath38 ( 3 ) , except looking at fluctuations @xmath100 of the voronoi volume @xmath101 of each particle .",
    "the voronoi volume is a geometric way of partitioning space , so that each particle claims the volume that is closer to its center than to the center of any other particle .",
    "particles with slightly larger voronoi volumes are , in some sense , seeing a slightly smaller local volume fraction , and this is correlated with a slightly enhanced mobility @xcite .",
    "the correlations @xmath99 do decay exponentially ( not shown ) , with a length scale of @xmath102 @xmath5 m for the four liquid samples we consider ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "strikingly , we see no clear volume fraction dependence of this length scale .",
    "furthermore , this length scale is quite similar to the length scales seen for @xmath39 .",
    "the lack of a clear connection to the length scale for mobility ( @xmath83 ) suggests that the correlation between the structure and the mobility , while present , is not the entire story ; the cooperative motions are influenced by more factors than just the local volume @xcite .    for the glassy samples ,",
    "the behaviour is strikingly different . as discussed before ,",
    "our glassy samples are aging , although for the duration of the experiment , little aging occurs .",
    "( we consider samples with a large age @xmath104  s and time scales @xmath105 . ) for our data , and for lag times @xmath106  s , almost all particle motion consists of particles moving back and forth within their cages . @xmath39 and @xmath38 have a low amplitude , as shown in figure [ fig - dt](c , d ) and figure [ fig - dr](b ) , indicating that most of the motion is uncorrelated .",
    "for the glassy samples , @xmath107 , similar to the liquids at small @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ fig - dr](b ) also shows that the correlation functions oscillate much less , and thus the local structure [ @xmath2 ] has a only a minor role for glasses .",
    "another intriguing difference is that @xmath109 , indicating fluctuations in the transverse directions are more strongly correlated than in the longitudinal direction .    the correlated motion that is present in the glasses , while of small amplitude , is rather long - ranged .",
    "similar to the supercooled fluids , the correlation functions for glasses show exponential decay over a range of time scales @xmath22 .",
    "the length scales for the decay are plotted in figure [ fig - phi ] .",
    "they are significantly larger than the length scales associated with the supercooled fluids ; for the glasses , @xmath110 @xmath5 m @xmath111 . the data shown in figure [ fig - phi ] also indicate that the scalar correlation lengths @xmath83 are noticeably larger than the vector correlation lengths @xmath81 , a trend which is the opposite that of the liquids .",
    "the existence of this long - range correlation is sensible , given that the glasses are more densely packed : while most motion is localized and uncorrelated , particles can move slightly if there is long - range cooperation , even if they then move back ( in order that there be no rearrangements ) . at present",
    ", however , it is unclear if these correlation length scales correspond to the intrinsic motion of the frozen glassy system , or if they are connected with the aging process @xcite .",
    "the previous observations that clusters of `` mobile '' particles are smaller is consistent with the low amplitude of the correlations @xcite .    unlike the correlated motion in glasses ,",
    "the structural correlations in the glassy samples are not long - ranged .",
    "the length scale for @xmath99 , the correlation function of the fluctuations of voronoi volumes , stays comparable to that of the liquids ( @xmath112 @xmath5 m for the glasses ) .",
    "while there is very little change of this length scale with @xmath6 , we do note that the two samples with the largest values of @xmath113 correspond to the same two samples with the largest values of @xmath114 , again suggesting a connection between the structure and correlated particle motion @xcite .",
    "by measuring the positions of several thousand particles over several hundred time steps , we have found that particle motion is correlated over distances of 3 - 4 particle diameters .",
    "in particular , particles undergoing cage rearrangements have anomalously large displacements , and these are highly spatially correlated .",
    "we note that the largest degree of correlation exists at the time scales corresponding to cage rearrangements , but that our observations do not preclude the sample from acting differently at very long time scales .",
    "all of our data is taken at time scales @xmath115 , so we are not able to quantify the behavior on time scales corresponding to alpha relaxation .    at time",
    "scales similar to the cage rearrangement time scale , the correlations decay exponentially with separation @xmath26 . at very large @xmath26",
    ", we would expect the correlations to recover a @xmath25 dependence as predicted for homogeneous viscoelastic media @xcite , at any time scale .",
    "this dependence is seen at short time scales in our data ( figure [ fig - bigdr ] ) , suggesting that the instantaneous response may be more continuum - like @xcite .",
    "this is sensible ; in such short time scales , @xmath116 , and so these motions are not related to dynamical heterogeneities , and do not lead to flow of the sample .",
    "rather , these are simple small amplitude affine deformations .",
    "it is intriguing that on the cage - rearrangement time scales , our image volume is not large enough to see the @xmath25 behavior , suggesting that the appropriate coarse - graining length scale is bigger than @xmath117 .",
    "the differing behaviour of the two correlation functions we examine suggests that these rearrangements are composed of regions of mobile particles ( particles with large displacements ) , but that the motions involve particles moving in many directions , rather than all of the particles moving in one coherent direction .",
    "this is especially clear as the correlations between the directions of motion of particles ( @xmath39 ) strongly depend on the pair correlation function ; within a group of mobile particles , their motions are often strongly directionally correlated , but also frequently not directionally correlated .",
    "this is consistent with particles moving in necklace - like loops , for example , as seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the mixing motions described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correlations become increasingly long - ranged as the glass transition is approached , as seen in two new correlation lengths @xmath83 and @xmath81 .",
    "this suggests that rearrangements involving regions consisting of a small number of particles become difficult or impossible as the volume fraction increases , which would explain the growth of the viscosity as the glass transition is approached .",
    "the size of these regions , quantified by the two correlation lengths @xmath81 and @xmath83 , are direct experimental evidence for dynamical length scales near the glass transition .",
