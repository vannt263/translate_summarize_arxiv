    "in the past many classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations have been found for static spherically symmetric gravitational fields with isotropic matter .",

    "these solutions may be used to model a neutral relativistic star as they are matchable to the schwarzschild exterior at the boundary . in comparison",
    "fewer exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell field equations are known for static spherically symmetric gravitational fields with isotropic matter with nonzero electric fields .",
    "a recent review of einstein - maxwell solutions is given by ivanov @xcite .",
    "these solutions may be utilized to model a charged relativistic star as they match to the reissner - nordstrom exterior .    in modelling a charged relativistic sphere",
    "it is desirable to ensure that two general features are contained in the model .",
    "firstly the model should be physically reasonable : the gravitational , electromagnetic and matter variables are continuous and well behaved in the interior , the interior metric matches smoothly to the exterior spacetime and causality is not violated .",
    "secondly we should regain an uncharged solution ( which should also satisfy the relevant physical conditions ) of the the einstein equations when the electrical field vanishes ; a neutral star should be regainable as a stable equilibrium end state .",
    "the anisotropic charged model of sharma et al @xcite is an example that satisfies the stated criteria .",
    "an approach in satisfying the two criteria is to construct the model such that the limiting uncharged solution is a known exact solution .",
    "this is not easy to achieve in practice as the number of known exact uncharged solutions satisfying all conditions of physical acceptability are limited as established by delgaty and lake @xcite .",
    "our objective in the paper is to generate a new solution of the einstein - maxwell system that is physically acceptable and necessarily contains a neutral stellar model .",
    "the neutral stellar model is the finch and skea star @xcite which satisfies all the requirement of physical acceptability . in ",
    "2 we express the einstein equations for neutral matter and the einstein - maxwell system for charged matter as equivalent sets of differential equations utilising a transformation due to durgapal and bannerji @xcite .",
    "we choose particular forms for one of the gravitational potentials and the the electric field intensity in  3 .",
    "the condition of pressure isotropy becomes a second order linear equation in the remaining gravitational potential .",
    "we integrate the condition of pressure isotropy and consequently produce three classes of exact solutions to the einstein - maxwell field equations which can be written explicitly in terms of elementary functions as shown in  3.1 ,  3.2 and  3.3 .",
    "we regain the uncharged exact solution found previously from the charged analogue of the finch and skea model in  3.2 ; we also demonstrate that the charged solution satisfies a barotropic equation of state . in ",
    "4 we comprehensively study the physical features of the charged finch - skea model .",
    "graphs are generated for particular parameter values for the gravitational , electromagnetic and matter variables .",
    "we consider in particular the gravitational behaviour at the centre , and also produce a specific value for the the charge to radius ratio .",
    "we believe that this detailed analysis of the matter variables represents a realistic model of a compact charged object .",
    "some brief concluding remarks are made in  5 .",

    "a generalisation of the system ( [ durg ] ) is the coupled einstein - maxwell field equations given by    [ durgc ] @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the electric field intensity and @xmath18 is the proper charge density .",
    "when the electric field @xmath19 then the einstein - maxwell equations ( [ durgc ] ) reduce to the einstein equations ( [ durg ] ) for neutral matter .",
    "the system of equations ( [ durgc ] ) governs the behaviour of the gravitational field for a charged perfect fluid .",
    "the particular representation of the einstein - maxwell system as given in ( [ durgc ] ) may be easier to integrate in certain situations as demonstrated by thirukkanesh and maharaj @xcite .",

    "consequently we need to specify two of the variables in advance so that a solution can be obtained .",
    "a possible approach is to specify an equation of state relating @xmath5 to @xmath6 and additionally to specify one of the gravitational potentials .",
    "this leads to differential equations that are highly nonlinear and difficult to integrate .",
    "another option , which is pursued here , is to postulate a form for the gravitational potential @xmath23 and to choose a form for the electrostatic field @xmath17 .",
    "our choice for the function @xmath24 is contained in the form used by thirukkanesh and maharaj @xcite and maharaj and mkhwanazi @xcite which ensures that we regain as a special case models of fluid spheres with uncharged matter distributions analysed previously .",

    "the metric functions @xmath141 and @xmath142 are plotted on the same interval in figures 5 and 6 , respectively .    from the plots in figures 1 - 2",
    ", we observe that the energy density @xmath5 and the pressure @xmath6 are positive and monotonically decreasing functions in the interior of the star .",
    "we observe from figure 3 that the electric field is positive and monotonically increasing on @xmath143 , has a maximum value at @xmath144 , and then decreases very slowly to the boundary .",
    "the potentials @xmath141 and @xmath142 are regular in the interior of the star as illustrated in figures 5 and 6 respectively .",
    "thus the quantities @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath17 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are continuous , regular and well behaved throughout the interval @xmath145 . from figure 2",
    "we note that the pressure vanishes at approximately @xmath146 which fixes the boundary of the charged star .",
    "the value ( [ 586 ] ) is consistent with the value of @xmath112 for which @xmath147 where @xmath6 is given by ( [ 585b ] ) .",
    "of course the boundary of the star will change for other values of @xmath35 and @xmath61 .",
    "a pleasing feature of this model is the behaviour of the speed of sound .",
    "it can be observed from figure 4 that the speed of sound is always less than unity everywhere for @xmath148 .",
    "therefore the causality principle @xmath149 holds throughout the star and the speed of sound is always less than the speed of light .",
    "thus our solution ( [ sol2 ] ) , with @xmath122 and @xmath150 , satisfies the requirements for a physically reasonable charged star .    utilising the information obtained from the graphs we are now able to examine the boundary conditions .",
    "in particular we have to match the interior ( [ metric2 ] ) to the reissner - nordstrom exterior ( [ exterior ] ) . with the help of @xmath151 , the vanishing surface pressure condition @xmath152 ,",
    "yields the following approximate dependence of the constant @xmath13 on the radius @xmath153 of the star : @xmath154 the continuity of the electric field across the boundary condition @xmath155 gives the relationship of the total charge @xmath22 of the star , as measured by an observer at infinity , with the radius @xmath153 for @xmath156 : @xmath157 then we are in a position to find the charge to radius ratio @xmath158 on matching of the interior gravitational potentials @xmath141 and @xmath142 from ( [ metric2 ] ) with the exterior reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution ( [ exterior ] ) we obtain    @xmath159 ^ 2 & = & \\frac{1}{1+cr^2 } \\label{588b }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on substituting ( [ 586 ] ) in ( [ 588b ] ) we find the following values for the constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath160 while ( [ 588a ] ) gives another expression for @xmath13 : @xmath161 in terms of @xmath22 .",
    "note that on setting @xmath162 we obtain the same value of @xmath13 as in the uncharged model of finch and skea @xcite .",
    "therefore the introduction of the electromagnetic field has the effect of decreasing the value of @xmath13 ; consequently the radius @xmath153 of the charged star is affected via the relationship ( [ 586 ] ) .",
    "substituting for @xmath13 from ( [ 586 ] ) and for @xmath22 from ( [ 587 ] ) in ( [ 588 ] ) we obtain the following mass - radius relationship : @xmath163 note that the buchdahl limit @xmath164 for stability is applicable for neutral stars .",
    "we observe that this limit is not violated in our solution ( [ sol2 ] ) in the presence of charge .",
    "in addition from ( [ 587 ] ) and ( [ 587 ] ) we obtain the following mass - charge ratio @xmath165 which satisfies the condition for equilibrium @xmath166 of charged stars with nonzero pressure in general as pointed out by cooperstock and de la cruz @xcite .",
    "in this paper we obtained three categories of solutions for the einstein - maxwell system ( [ durgc ] ) corresponding to the electric field intensity ( [ e ] ) . in the first category of solutions @xmath167",
    "( except at the centre ) and the solutions can be written in terms of elementary functions . in the second category of solutions it is possible for @xmath86 throughout the interior spacetime and",
    "we consequently regain the finch and skea solution @xcite which is a good model for a neutron star .",
    "the charged analogue of the finch - skea solution is given in terms of bessel functions of half - integer order .",
    "we demonstrated that this charged solution satisfies an explicit barotropic equation of state . in the third category of solutions @xmath168",
    "( except at the centre ) and the solutions can be written in terms of modified bessel functions of half - integer order .",
    "a detailed analysis of the charged analogue of the finch - skea solution was carried out . for specific parameter values the energy density @xmath5 , the pressure @xmath6 , the electric field intensity @xmath17 , the speed of sound @xmath169 , the gravitational potential @xmath141 and the metric function @xmath142 were plotted .",
    "the profiles of the matter , electromagnetic and gravitation variables suggest that these quantities are well behaved so that the charged analogue of the finch - skea solution describes a realistic charged stellar body .",
    "it was shown that the speed of sound is less than the speed of light and consequently causality is not violated .",
    "in particular we observe that the mass - radius ratio is within the buchdahl limit for uncharged stars and the mass - charge ratio is consistent with the requirements of cooperstock and de la cruz @xcite . as this model contains the physically acceptable finch and skea solution and appears to be physically viable , a detailed analysis of the stability",
    "should be carried out ; this is the subject of ongoing research .",
