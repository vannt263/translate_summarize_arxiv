    "after the seminal work of randall and sundrum(rs)@xcite several other results have been developed based on the idea of membranes as topological defects and its implications for brane world physics@xcite . in these models one must determine the space of solutions of a schrdinger equation with a specific potential which depends on the warp factor .",
    "that is , one needs to solve a sturm - liouville problem to find eigensolutions with eigenvalues .",
    "a particular application of this kind of model is in the study of gravity trapping in a finite thickness domain wall @xcite , where a constant potential in the region near / over the membrane is chosen in order to find analytical solutions .",
    "the benefits of such analytical solutions are worth because it allows explicitly analysis of the kaluza - klein masses and opens up possibilities for analytical studies of fermionic modes .",
    "these analysis and possibilities can be extended even more if different potentials for the graviton wave function modes can be solved analytically .    in this manuscript , we present a new explicit integrable schrdinger potentials for the graviton wave function modes parameterized by the thickness of the wall .",
    "the warp factor is chosen in order to be continuous in the boundary of two regions of the space - time .",
    "these two regions basically describe the interaction right near / over the membrane location and interactions far from the membrane .",
    "we find an equation that drives the profile of the brane . with this",
    "we show that the function used in @xcite is just a particular solution of the equation presented here .",
    "this reveals a new space of analytical solutions and , as direct consequences , new zero modes , kaluza - klein modes , new resonance behavior , and so on .",
    "the new analytical solutions are encoded in a schrdinger - like differential equation with zero eigenvalue . with this",
    "is possible to show that , for small values of @xmath5 , the probability density for finding a mass mode in the membrane does not depend on the chosen potential . in this way",
    ", the leading order correction of the four dimensional newton s law , for example , has a general expression that does not depend on the potential used . in the following lines we discuss how to apply this method to study the physics of gravitational fields , scalar fields and gauge vector fields in the rs scenario",
    "to start our reasoning we remember the fact that the mass spectrum of the gravity field is driven by a schrdinger like equation @xcite @xmath6 where the effective potential depends on the warp factor , @xmath7 , as below @xmath8 and the metric in the conformal coordinate is given by @xmath9 . by analyzing the above equation it has been shown that the zero mode @xmath10 is trapped in the membrane .",
    "however as @xmath11 , the massive modes are not localized .",
    "an important phenomenological aspect related to this is the appearance of resonances .",
    "this allows for the possibility of unstable massive modes that could be seen in the membrane .",
    "most of these studies have been performed numerically by considering smooth versions of the rs model .",
    "these smooth versions can be obtained , for instance , by considering the membrane as a topological defect generated by a scalar field . in this scenario",
    "the condition imposed is that for large @xmath12 the rs warp factor is recovered .",
    "these models have many interesting properties and have been widely studied over the last decade@xcite .",
    "another way to get a smooth version of the rs model is by considering the brane as a thick domain wall @xcite . in these papers",
    "the potential used depends on one parameter @xmath13 which determines the thickness of the membrane . in order to get",
    "the desired smooth version , @xmath14 and @xmath15 must be continuous and this imposes some restrictions on the form of @xmath7 in the membrane .",
    "the choice of @xcite was @xmath16 and this give the effective potential @xmath17 . with this",
    ", the resonances of the model were studied analytically in detail .    in order to obtain a wider class of new exact solutions , we divide the warp factor @xmath7 in two regions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 , & |z|\\leq d,\\\\ ~\\\\ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{|z|+\\beta}\\right ) , & |z|\\geq d , \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath21 as the associated function . the analytical solution for @xmath19",
    "is already known @xcite , then we focus in analytical solutions for @xmath18 . with eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ u(a ) ] ) we get that @xmath21 satisfies the associated equation @xmath22 this is exactly the effective schrdinger equation ( [ sch ] ) for @xmath23 . in order to implement the boundary conditions ,",
    "we restrict to even functions @xmath24 with @xmath25 in , guarantying that the boundary conditions are satisfied in both edges of the brane , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the condition @xmath28 implies that @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath30 is an even function we also have @xmath31 .",
    "this conditions fix completely the solution of . with the above considerations and by imposing continuity of @xmath7 and @xmath32 at @xmath33 we obtain @xmath34 with the conditions @xmath35 and @xmath30 positive and limited in @xmath18 . in the last section it will become clear why we have written @xmath36 .",
    "as a first example , let us consider a constant potential @xmath37 in the region @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we know that the solution for the schdinger equation ( [ sch ] ) is a linear combination of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the even solution for @xmath40 that satisfies @xmath29 is @xmath41 .",
    "the conditions @xmath35 and @xmath42 implies that @xmath43 .",
    "this is the solution introduced in @xcite .",
    "as a straightforward application of the method developed here lets examine the harmonic oscillator with schrdinger equation @xmath44 the above equation can be cast in the form of a kummer equation @xcite , by writing @xmath45 and next using the transformation @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then , solutions of are linear combinations of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the kummer confluent hypergeometric function . from now on we will use for the even(odd ) solution in @xmath18 the notation @xmath53(@xmath54 ) . the even solution for @xmath40 with @xmath29 is @xmath55    in fact , we can find a large new class of solutions simply considering @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "using the above - mentioned steps we find the pair of solutions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the wronskian of @xmath61 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the wronskian is constant for schrdinger - like equations .",
    "the even solution satisfies @xmath29 and the value of the constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 are related in order to give @xmath35 and @xmath42 . as an example , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath30 is positive defined for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the method described here can be applied to many other cases known in physics .",
    "one possibility is the problem for a particle in a box subject to a constant field .",
    "this is described by a linear potential@xmath68 giving rise to the airy functions with solutions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . however",
    ", this potential do not satisfies the condition of being even .",
    "another class of analytical solutions can be found by considering exponential potentials . from these",
    "the only even one is the pschl - teller potential , where the schrdinger - like equation is @xmath71 rewriting @xmath72 and next using the transformation @xmath73 , we can write as a hypergeometric differential equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . therefore the linearly independent solutions of are @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "after fixing the background with the above method we turn our attention to the gravity resonances . the interesting fact about",
    "this background is that we automatically have exact solutions to equation just by not fixing @xmath40 . with this",
    "we get an analytical expression for our resonances .",
    "as we are interested in resonances we must consider a plane wave coming from @xmath82 .",
    "this plane wave will collide with the membrane and will generate a reflected and a transmitted wave .",
    "therefore , for @xmath83 we must have a linear combination of waves moving to the left and to the right .",
    "for @xmath84 we must have only one wave moving to the right . in order to analyze the resonances we fix the coefficient of the incoming wave equal to one . in this way , the schrdinger - like equation has the solution @xmath85 where @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "we shall use the convention that @xmath88 . taking the continuity of the wave function and its derivative at @xmath33 and using the fact that @xmath89 are even and @xmath54 are odd",
    "we finally obtain the transmission coefficient    @xmath90    with this expression and the solutions found before we can easily obtain graphics for the transmission coefficients . in fig .",
    "[ parabolic ] we show the trasmission for the parabolic potential . as expected ,",
    "depending on the parameters we can have different peaks of resonances .",
    "it is important to point that as narrow the resonance peak the stronger is the signal of the mass mode . in fig .",
    "[ parabolic ] we see that happening for the first peaks . for the pschl - teller potential fig . [ pteller ] shows resonances depending on the parameters . for the parameters used the resonances are more peaked , what is phenomenologically more interesting",
    "it is clear that the potentials present resonances with different characteristics .",
    "in order to analyze the deviation of newton s law , we must calculate the probability density of the wave function at @xmath91 : @xmath92 the above expression is plotted in fig .",
    "[ psi ] for the parabolic potential with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .    for small values of @xmath5 , @xmath95 has the following form for @xmath96 : @xmath97 where @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "the function @xmath53 is well defined for @xmath40 , i.e , @xmath53 do not have poles at @xmath40 . therefore , for small @xmath5 we can expand @xmath53 in a power series in @xmath101 : @xmath102 .",
    "the wronskian @xmath103 is zero due to the boundary conditions .",
    "then we have @xmath104 . with this",
    "we arrive to the following expansion for @xmath105 :    @xmath106 are coefficients that depend on the potential used through @xmath107 . for large @xmath5 , @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    "consequently @xmath110 when @xmath111 .    to calculate the deviation of newton s law we have to plug the expansion ( [ aexp ] ) in the expression ( r)=_0^|_m(0)|^2 e^-mrdm , and integrate from @xmath112 for the small @xmath113 expansion and @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "the integration gives us @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the complete gamma function and @xmath118 is the meijer g - function .",
    "in a previous work the present authors have found analytical solutions for other bosonic fields in the potential well case @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "we can use this and the above method to find new analytical solutions to the scalar and vector fields .",
    "what was pointed out in that work is that for any effective potential which takes the form @xmath120 , an analytical solution can be found easily just by changing some parameters of the theory .",
    "we have also shown that for the scalar and vector fields @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively .",
    "we also pointed that the parameter for the scalar field is the same of the gravity field , therefore all results are identical and we just need to consider the vector case here .",
    "the only thing we need to do is to change @xmath123 in eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ cont ] ) .",
    "the effect of this for the exterior solution is to change the order of the hankel function @xmath124 .",
    "the interior region is changed throughout the contour conditions ( [ cont ] ) . therefore all the main results , namely eqs .",
    "( [ psim ] ) , ( [ analictt ] ) , ( [ psi0 ] ) and ( [ aexp ] ) are kept unchanged up to the above change in the parameters .",
    "therefore , the expansion for small masses have the same general behavior also for the scalar and vector fields . in fig . [ vetor ]",
    "we show the transmission coefficients for the vector case .",
    "note that the change of the potential can give very different phenomenological results for a observer in the brane .    at this point",
    "some discussion about the fermion case is important .",
    "the main difference between this and the bosonic case is the fact that the way to get a nontrivial potential is through the addition of a coupling with a scalar field .",
    "this is described in very well in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is used the constant potential of @xcite .",
    "the fact is that when this coupling is considered two additional complications arise .",
    "one is the fact that the following relation @xmath125 must be satisfied @xcite .",
    "therefore we must impose the continuity of the second derivative of the warp factor if we wants a continuous first derivative of the scalar field .",
    "another and more difficult problem is that the effective potential is given by @xmath126 which do not posses a general analytical solution even for the simplest case of the constant potential@xcite .",
    "in summary we have described a prescription to find new analytical solutions in thick brane models .",
    "two cases are presented as examples : we have shown results for the parabolic and the pschl - teller potentials .",
    "we have studied the problem of resonances in co - dimension one brane world , finding the mass spectra of the new profiles for the thick branes proposed . for these potentials , the transmission coefficients for the masses",
    "are plotted expressing the different peculiarities of each potential .",
    "it is important to stress that this work is a generalization of the article @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the solution used by mirjam et.al . is a particular solution of a wider class described here , including the cases of scalar and vector fields .",
    "we also have shown that the correction in the newtons law found by them is valid for any of these wider class of solutions .",
    "the results found here opens up the possibility to explore different backgrounds to study gravity , scalar and vector field resonances in the randall - sundrum model . for the fermionic case",
    "it is not possible to aplly the same methods .",
    "only numerical results were found and we hope , in next studies , to go one step further in finding pure analytical solutions .",
