    "here we present the main lines of a theory of motion planning for kinematic systems , which is developped for about ten years in the papers  @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of the paper is to survey the whole theory disseminated in these papers .",
    "but also we improve on the theory , by treating one more case , in which `` the fourth order brackets are involved '' .",
    "we aslo improve on several previous results ( periodicity of our optimal trajectories for instance )",
    ".  potential application of this theory is motion planning for kinematic robots",
    ".  we will show several basic examples here .",
    "the theory starts from the seminal work of f.  jean , in the papers @xcite .  at the root of this point of view in robotics ,",
    "there are also more applied authors like j.p .",
    "laumond @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "we consider kinematic systems that are given under the guise of a vector - distribution @xmath1 over a @xmath2-dimensional manifold @xmath3 .",
    "the rank of the distribution is @xmath4 , and the corank @xmath5motion planning problems will aways be local problems in an open neighborhood of a given finite path @xmath6 in @xmath7 then we may always consider that @xmath8 from a control point of view , a kinematic system can be specified by a control system , linear in the controls , typically denoted by @xmath9:@xmath10    where the @xmath11 s are smooth ( @xmath12 vector fields that span the distribution @xmath13 the standard controllability assumption is always assumed , i.e.  the lie algebra generated by the @xmath11 s is transitive on @xmath7 consequently , the distribution @xmath1 is _ completely nonintegrable _ , and any smooth path @xmath14\\rightarrow m$ ] can be unifomly approximated by an admissible path @xmath15\\rightarrow m $ ] , i.e. a lipschitz path , which is almost everywhere tangent to @xmath16 i.e. , a trajectory of ( [ sys1])@xmath17    this is precisely the _ abstract answer _ to the kinematic motion planning probem : _ it is possible to approximate uniformly nonadmissible paths by admissible ones_. the purpose of this paper is to present a general constructive theory that solves this problem in a certain _ optimal _ way .",
    "more precisely , in this class of problems , it is natural to try to minimize a cost of the following form:@xmath18 for several reasons : 1 .",
    "the optimal curves do not depend on their parametrization , 2 .",
    "the minimization of such a cost produces a metric space ( the associated distance is called the subriemannian distance , or the carnot - caratheodory distance ) , 3 .",
    "minimizing such a cost is equivalent to minimize the following ( called the _ energy _ of the path ) quadratic cost @xmath19 , in fixed time @xmath20:@xmath21    the distance is defined as the minimum length of admissible curves connecting two points , and the length of the admissible curve corresponding to the control @xmath22\\rightarrow m$ ] is just @xmath23    in this presentation , another way to interpret the problem is as follows : the dynamics is specified by the distribution @xmath1 ( i.e. not by the vector fields @xmath24 but their span only ) .",
    "the cost is then determined by an euclidean metric @xmath25 over @xmath16 specified here by the fact that the @xmath11 s  form an orthonormal frame field for the metric .    at this point",
    "we would like to make a more or less philosophical comment : there is , in the world of nonlinear control theory , a permanent twofold critic against the optimal control approach : 1 .",
    "the choice of the cost to be minimized is in general rather arbitrary , and 2 .",
    "optimal control solutions may be non robust .     some remarkable conclusions of our theory show the following : in reasonable dimensions and codimensions , the optimal trajectories are extremely robust , and in particular , do not depend at all ( modulo certain natural transformations ) on the choice of the metric , but on the distribution @xmath1 only",
    ". even stronger : they depend only on the _ nilpotent approximation along _ @xmath6 ( a concept that will be defined later on , which is a good local approximation of the problem ) .  for a lot of low values of the rank @xmath4 and corank",
    "@xmath26 these nilpotent approximations have no parameter ( hence they are in a sense universal ) .  the _ asymptotic optimal sysntheses _",
    "( i.e. the phase portraits of the admissible trajectories that approximate up to a small @xmath27 are also universal .    given a motion planning problem , specified by a ( nonadmissible ) curve @xmath28 and a subriemannian structure ( [ sys1 ] ) ,",
    "we will consider two distinct concepts , namely : 1 .  the _ metric complexity _",
    "@xmath29 that measures asymptotically the length of the best @xmath30-approximating admissible trajectories@xmath31 and 2 .",
    "the _ interpolation entropy _ @xmath32 , that measures the length of the best admissible curves that interpolate @xmath6 with pieces of length @xmath33    the first concept was introduced by f.  jean in his basic paper @xcite . the second concept is closely related with the entropy of f.  jean in @xcite , which is more or less the same as the kolmogorov s entropy of the path @xmath28 for the metric structure induced by the carnot - caratheodory metric of the ambient space .    also , along the paper , we will deal with _",
    "generic _ problems only ( but generic in the global sense , i.e.  stable singularities are considered ) .",
    "that is , the set of motion planning problems on @xmath34 is the set of couples @xmath35 embedded with the @xmath36 topology of uniform convergence over compact sets , and generic problems ( or _ problems in general position _ ) form an open - dense set in this topology .",
    "for instance , it means that the curve @xmath6 is always tranversal to @xmath1 ( except maybe at isolated points , in the cases @xmath37 only ) .",
    "another example is the case of a surface of degeneracy of the lie bracket distribution @xmath38 $ ] in the @xmath39 @xmath37 case .",
    "generically , this surface ( the martinet surface ) is smooth , and @xmath6 intersects it transversally at a finite number of points only .",

    "m1aoh505    on the figure [ figmov ] , we show the motion of the ball with a trailer on the plane ( motion of the contact point between the ball and the plane).here , the problem is to move along the @xmath50-axis , keeping constant the frame attached to the ball and the angle of the trailer .",
    "some movies of minimum entropy for the ball rolling on a plane and the ball with a trailer are visible on the website * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * .",
    "our first conclusion is the following : there are certain universal pictures for the motion planning problem , in corank less or equal to 3 , and in rank 2 , with 4 brackets at most ( could be 5 brackets at a singularity , with the logarithmic lemma ) .",
    "these figures are , in the two - step bracket generating case : a circle , for the third bracket , the periodic elastica , for the 4@xmath0 bracket , the plane curve of the figure [ fig62 ] .",
    "they are periodic plane curves whose curvature is respectively : a constant , a linear function of of the position , a quadratic function of the position .",
    "m1aoh507    this is , as shown on figure [ global ] , the clear beginning of a series .",
    "as one can see , in many cases ( 2 controls , or corank @xmath438 our strategy is extremely robust in the following sense : the asymptotic optimal syntheses do not depend , from the qualitative point of view , of the metric chosen .",
    "they depend only on the number of brackets needed to generate the space .",
    "the main practical problem of implementation of our strategy comes with the @xmath59-modifications .  how to compute them , how to implement ?",
    "in fact , the @xmath59-modifications count at higher order in the entropy .",
    "but , if not applied , they may cause deviations that are not neglectible .  the high order w.r.t . @xmath59 in the estimates of the error between the original system and its nilpotent approximation ( formulas [ ff0 ] , [ ff1 ] , [ ff2 ] , [ ff3 ] ) make these deviations very small .",
    "it is why the use of our concept of a nilpotent approximation along @xmath28 based upon normal coordinates is very efficient in practice .     on the other hand , when a correction appears to be needed ( after a noneglectible deviation )",
    ", it corresponds to brackets of lower order .",
    "for example , in the case of the ball with a trailer ( 4@xmath0 bracket ) , the @xmath59-modification corresponds to brackets of order 2 or 3 .",
    "the optimal pictures corresponding to these orders can still be used to perform the @xmath59-modifications .",
    "this approach , to approximate optimally nonadmissible paths of nonholomic systems , looks very efficient , and in a sense , universal .  of course , the theory is not complete , but the cases under consideration ( first , 2-step bracket - generating , and second , two controls ) correspond to many practical situations .",
    "but there is still a lot of work to do to in order to cover all interesting cases .",
    "however , the methodology to go ahead is rather clear .",
    "we will make a succession of changes of parametriztion of the surrface @xmath182 ( w.r.t . which normal coordinates were constructed ) .",
    "these coordinate changes will always preserve tha fact that @xmath282 is the point @xmath440    remind that @xmath186 vanishes on @xmath441 and since @xmath50 has order @xmath442 we can already write on @xmath162 : @xmath443 @xmath328one of the @xmath444 s ( say @xmath445 has to be nonzero ( if not , @xmath6 is tangent to @xmath446 then , @xmath447 has order 2 on @xmath76set for @xmath448 @xmath449differentiating , we get that @xmath450 and @xmath451 @xmath452 have order 3 .",
    "we set also @xmath453 and we are at the following point:@xmath454 where @xmath455 @xmath456 are liner in @xmath457 the function @xmath458 can be put to 1 in the same way by setting @xmath459 now let @xmath460 be an invertible 2@xmath461 matrix .",
    "set @xmath462 it is easy to see that we can chose @xmath460 for we get : @xmath463    another change of the form : @xmath464 where @xmath465 is linear in @xmath50 kills @xmath394 and brings us to @xmath466this @xmath166 can be of the form @xmath467 where @xmath468 is quadratic in @xmath457 if we kill @xmath469 we get the expected result .",

    "since we are in dimension 2 , it is always liouville - integrable .",
    "then , we are looking for solutions of the system of pde s : @xmath477 but the schwartz integrability conditions are satisfied : @xmath478    [ [ appendix-3-periodicity - of - the - optimal - curves - in - the-6 - 2-case - periodicity ] ] appendix 3 : periodicity of the optimal curves in the 6 - 2 case [ periodicity ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        it follows that the last equation can be rewritten  @xmath480 for some never vanishing function @xmath394 ( vanishing would contradict the full rank of @xmath481 ) .",

    "therefore , the problem is the same as maximizing @xmath496 but with the ( larger ) endpoint condition @xmath505 ( free ) .",
