    "the nucleon spin sum rule can be written in a heuristic way as : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin and @xmath8 is the orbital angular momentum contribution coming from the partons .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to estimate the gluon polarisation , @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis is performed in two complementary kinematic regions : @xmath9 ( low @xmath10 )  @xcite and @xmath11 ( high @xmath10 ) regions .",
    "the present work is mainly focused on the analysis for high @xmath10 .    spin - dependent effects can be measured experimentally using the helicity asymmetry @xmath12 defined as @xmath13 where ( @xmath14 ) and ( @xmath15 ) refer to the parallel and anti - parallel spin helicity configuration of the beam lepton ( @xmath16 ) with respect to the target nucleon ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) . according to the factorisation theorem in dis , the ( polarised ) cross sections can be written as the convolution of the ( polarised ) parton distribution function , ( @xmath19)@xmath20 , the hard scattering partonic cross section , ( @xmath19)@xmath21 , and the fragmentation function .",
    "the gluon polarisation is measured directly via the photon - gluon fusion ( pgf ) process , which allows to probe the spin of the gluon inside the nucleon . to tag this process directly in dis a high @xmath1 hadron pair data sample",
    "is used to calculate the helicity asymmetry .",
    "two other processes compete with the pgf process in leading order qcd approximation , namely the virtual photo - absorption leading order process ( lp ) and the gluon radiation ( qcd compton ) process .",
    "the helicity asymmetry for the high @xmath1 hadron pair data sample can thus be schematically written as :    @xmath22    the @xmath23 are the fractions of each process , @xmath24 refers to the different processes .",
    "@xmath25 represents the partonic cross section asymmetries , @xmath26 , also known as analysing power .",
    "@xmath27 is the depolarisation factor , which is the fraction of the muon beam polarisation transferred to the virtual photon .",
    "the virtual photon asymmetry @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "this asymmetry @xmath28 is estimated using a parametrisation based on the @xmath30 asymmetry of the inclusive data  @xcite . a similar equation to ( [ eq : allmain ] )",
    "can be written to express the inclusive asymmetry of a data sample , @xmath31 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : allmain ] ) for the high @xmath1 hadron pair sample and the above mentioned equation for the inclusive sample the following expression is obtained :    @xmath32,\\label{eq : alphas}\\\\        \\alpha_2 & = a_{\\rm        ll}^{incl,{\\rm pgf}}r_{\\rm qcdc}\\frac{r_{\\rm pgf}^{incl}}{r_{\\rm        lp}^{incl}}\\frac{a_{\\rm ll}^{\\rm qcdc}}{d}~ , & \\beta_2 & = a_{\\rm        ll}^{incl,{\\rm qcdc}}\\frac{r_{\\rm qcdc}^{incl}}{r_{\\rm        lp}^{incl}}\\frac{r_{\\rm qcdc}}{r_{\\rm lp}^{incl}}\\frac{a_{\\rm        ll}^{\\rm qcdc}}{d}\\label{eq : betas}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    due to the fact that @xmath0 is present in formula  ( [ eq : dgg ] ) at two different @xmath4 ( noted @xmath4 and @xmath33 ) , the extraction of @xmath0 requires a definition of the averaged @xmath34 at which the measurement is performed .",
    "data from years 2002 to 2006 are used .",
    "these data were obtained from polarised muons of 190 gev / c scattered off a polarised lid target at the compass experiment at the cern sps .",
    "the selected events have an interaction vertex containing an incoming muon and a scattered muon .",
    "the data are divided into two sets : the high @xmath1 hadron pair and the inclusive data sample .",
    "both data sets have the @xmath35 kinematic cut applied .",
    "another cut is applied on the fraction of energy taken by the virtual photon , @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "these cuts are used to select the _",
    "inclusive sample_.    in the high @xmath1 hadrons data sample , besides the inclusive selection , at least two outgoing high @xmath38 hadrons are required .",
    "these so - called hadron candidates must fulfil the following requirements : the hadrons with the highest transverse momentum must have @xmath39 and the hadron with second highest transverse momentum , @xmath40 . this requirement constitutes the high @xmath1 cut .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to calculate the gluon polarisation , @xmath0 , in an event - by - event basis using an optimal weight which improves the figure of merit .",
    "the asymmetry used for the @xmath0 extraction is related with the experimental helicity asymmetry , @xmath12 , described in section [ sec : analysis ] , using a weigthing factor @xmath41 .",
    "the correct weight , in this case , should take into account all the variables that appear in the set of equations ( [ eq : acorr ] ) to ( [ eq : betas ] ) , namely : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the _ dilution factor _ , the fraction of polarisable target material , @xmath27 is the _ depolarisation factor _ , the fraction of muon polarisation is transferred to the virtual photon , @xmath44 is the muon polarisation and @xmath45 is defined in equation [ eq : acorr ] .    in this analysis",
    "it is not possible to tag the events of each involved process , therefore the process fractions @xmath46 and the partonic asymmetries @xmath47 can not be directly determined from the data samples . to estimate or parametrise these quantities a neural network  @xcite",
    "the neural network is trained by taking as input samples obtained by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the result is a parametrisation which is used for the real data to provide the values for all these quantities in an event by event basis .",
    "the event simulation is one of the issues of major importance for this analysis since several parameters for the @xmath0 extraction are taken from the simulation .",
    "thus a strong effort was made to achieve a simulation very close to the real data .",
    "the mc production comprises three steps : first the events are generated , then the particles pass through a simulated spectrometer using a program based on geant 3  @xcite and finally the events are reconstructed using the same procedure applied to real data . for the first step the lepto 6.5  @xcite dis event generator is used together with a leading order parametrisation of the parton distributions .",
    "the fragmentation is based on the lund string model  @xcite implemented in jetset  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : p ] illustrates the quality of the simulation obtained at the end .",
    "the next step was the tuning of the event generator .",
    "the parton distribution function ( pdf ) set used in this analysis is mstw2008lo  @xcite . for the calculation of @xmath48 in lepto",
    "the ratio @xmath49 is needed . here",
    "the parametrisation of ref .",
    "@xcite was used . to improve the description of the hadrons , higher order qcd corrections",
    "are partially simulated by including gluon radiation in the initial and final states ( _ parton shower _  ps )  @xcite .",
    "an extensive and careful _ tuning _ of the lund string fragmentation function parameters and of the hadron intrinsic transverse momentum parameters was performed .",
    "the tuning was done first on the fragmentation function parameters , in this case of the the lund string function : @xmath50 where @xmath51 ; the parameters are @xmath52 and @xmath53 which are controlled by the jetset parameters ` parj(41 ) ` and ` parj(42 ) ` .",
    "the second step was the tuning of the hadron intrinsic transverse momentum model , described in  @xcite .",
    "the parameters for this model are parj(21 ) , parj(23 ) and parj(24 ) , which correspond , respectively , to the _ sigma _ of the main gaussian , to the _ sigma _ and to the _ amplitude _ fractions for the second gaussian .",
    "the result of all these improvements is the compass tuning .    in figure",
    "[ fig : p ] the kinematic distributions and some hadronic distributions are shown , details can be found in the figures caption . in these figures ,",
    "two mc simulations with different tunings are shown : the lepto default and the compass tuning .",
    "in general the compass tuning describes better the data , particularly for the hadronic variables @xmath1 and @xmath54 in which a remarkable agreement between mc and data is presented in the figure .",
