    "while its local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity is near zero , 21-cm wavelength h  i spectra toward its h  ii region(s ) show clouds of absorbing gas with lsr velocities out to 55  km s@xmath1@xcite .",
    "this effectively rules out the near kinematic distance of 0.5  kpc .. ] the apparent cutoff in h  i absorption above 55  km s@xmath1  suggests that the source is not at the far distance either ( 16  kpc ) , but rather lies deep in the inner galaxy on the near side of the tangent point .",
    "however , this argument may partly be affected by the decrease of cold and dense h  i inside the galactic gas hole ( galactocentric radius @xmath2  kpc ) , since this gas component is the one responsible for well - defined h  i absorption lines .    in order to determine the true distance and",

    "in addition to the parallax , we accurately determine the proper motion of the masers with respect to background quasars . combining the coordinates , distance , lsr velocity and proper motions yields the full 3-dimensional location and kinematics of the massive star - forming region .",
    "this complete information clearly associates with the complex inner region of the galaxy where the central bar has strong gravitational influence .",
    "using the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) , we observed the high - mass star forming region ( hmsfr ) in the @xmath3  e ch@xmath4oh transition ( rest frequency 12178.597  ghz ) .",
    "background information about our vlba program to measure parallaxes for hmsfrs is given in @xcite , hereafter called paper i. we observed under program br100a at 5 epochs : 2005 march 25 and october 8 , 2006 march 16 and october 4 , 2007 march 16 .",
    "these dates were chosen to sample the peaks of the parallax signature in right ascension , since the amplitude of the declination parallax signature is small and those position measurements are more susceptible to systematic errors at the low declination of this source .",
    "paper i describes the general observational strategy and data calibration procedures .",
    "the maser observations were centered at the systemic velocity ( v@xmath5 ) of + 2.0  km s@xmath1 , also traced with the ch@xmath4cn  @xmath6 line emission by @xcite .",
    "spectral resolution was 0.38  km s@xmath1 .",
    "two fringe finders , j17430350 and j1800 + 3848 from the icrf catalog , were observed for single - band delay and instrumental phase - offset calibration . for background position references , we observed 4 calibrators , j18032030 , j18042147 , j18082124 and j18112055 , from the extragalactic radio survey by @xcite .",
    "only the first and last calibrators were detected with our vlba measurements ( see table  [ tab1 ] and figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we selected the lsr velocity channel at + 0.1  km s@xmath1  as the phase reference , corresponding to the peak intensity of the bright and compact maser spot f1 , following the labeling of @xcite ( see figure  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] summarizes source properties .",
    "the absolute positions of the two background sources were not known with sufficient accuracy to be used to determine the absolute position of the maser emission . however , the _ a priori _ position of the maser reference spot ( f1 ) was correct to about 20  mas , as indicated by the low fringe rates of the interferometer phases .",
    "after calibration , we imaged the phase reference maser channel and continuum sources using the aips task imagr with a circular restoring beam of @xmath7 at each epoch , equal to the east - west naturally weighted dirty beam size , which was typically @xmath8 at a p.a .",
    "of @xmath9 east of north , since the parallax information comes essentially from the east - west position shifts .",
    "the intensity peak of the phase reference spot varied by less than @xmath10% across our observations spanning 2  yr ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the images of the background sources , j18032030 and j18112055 , and the phase reference maser spot from the middle epoch .",

    "when imaging this source , we used a larger circular restoring beam of @xmath11 .",
    "this beam size was set to maximize the brightness sensitivity in the image . for parallax purposes",
    ", we fitted only the peak of the emission . at the first epoch ( 2005 march 25 ) only 4 ( br , fd , nl , ov ) vlba antennas were usable and the dynamic range of the images was about 7 times worse than for the subsequent 4 epochs .",
    "this precluded the use of the extended source j18112055 at this epoch .",
    "we measured the positions of the maser and the background sources by fitting elliptical gaussian brightness distributions to the detected emission ( aips task jmfit ) .",
    "we measured the parallax and the proper motion of 12  ghz methanol masers by modeling the position differences between the reference maser spot and each calibrator versus time .",
    "the model is the sum of the parallax sinusoid , including the effects of the ellipticity of the earth s orbit , and a linear motion in each coordinate .",
    "since systematic errors usually dominate over random noise , we adopted an `` a posteriori '' estimate of the errors from the fit itself .",
    "we assigned independent `` error floors '' to the east and north position offsets and added them in quadrature to the formal position fitting uncertainties .",
    "this procedure was iterated , adjusting error floors to achieve a reduced @xmath12 per degree of freedom near unity in each coordinate ( see paper  i for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we down - weighted the data from the first epoch ( 2005 march 25 ) by a factor 7 , equal to the dynamic range degradation of the background source images .",
    "we can also put an upper limit on the shift over time of the centroid position of the quasars due to a possible jet component evolution .",
    "the small residuals for the parallax fits relative to the two quasars , and the similar parallax results , suggest that such effects are less than about 50  @xmath13as",
    ".    table  [ tab2 ] and figure  [ fig2 ] show the results of the parallax and proper motion fit for each background source . while the post - fit residuals for the fit using j18032030 were about half that of the fit using j18112055 , the j18032030 fit is dominated by data from only three epochs . as such",
    ", there are effectively near - zero degrees of freedom and the formal errors are not reliable .",
    "since we could not reliably determine the relative weights for the two parallax data sets , we calculated an un - weighted average , instead of the combined fit procedure applied in previous papers ( e.g. paper  i ) .",
    "the measured parallax of obtained in this manner is @xmath14  mas , corresponding to a distance of @xmath0  kpc .",
    "our new distance indicates that the luminosity of the brightest 6.7  ghz methanol maser observed in the galaxy has been substantially underestimated in the past . the near kinematic distance ( 2.0  kpc ) adopted by @xcite",
    "is only 38% of our measured distance implying a 7 times brighter source .",
    "this kinematic distance was derived by based on oh masers velocities , assuming the @xcite galactic rotation model and a sun  galactic center distance ( r@xmath15 ) of 10  kpc . adopting the iau value of the distance to the galactic center , r@xmath16  kpc",
    ", our measured distance translates to a galactocentric radius of 3.5  kpc .",
    "the measured mean proper motion is @xmath17  mas  yr@xmath1 toward the east and @xmath18  mas  yr@xmath1 toward the north ; at our measured distance these values correspond to @xmath19  km s@xmath1and @xmath20  km s@xmath1  eastward and northward , respectively . completing the kinematic information",

    "we compare our measurements with a simple rotation model of the galaxy , converting these values from the equatorial heliocentric reference frame to a rotating galactic reference frame .",
    "this approach subtracts a circular velocity component at the position of the source and yields a peculiar motion vector with respect to circular rotation @xcite . assuming negligible internal motions of ch@xmath4oh masers ( e.g. @xcite ) and adopting the iau value for the distance to the galactic center ( r@xmath16  kpc ) , the rotation velocity at the solar circle ( @xmath22  km s@xmath1 ) , and the _ hipparcos _ measurements of the solar motion @xcite , the peculiar velocity components of are @xmath23  km s@xmath1 , where u@xmath24 , v@xmath24 and w@xmath24 are directed toward the galactic center , in the direction of galactic rotation and toward the north galactic pole , respectively",
    ". using instead the best - fit values of r@xmath25  kpc and @xmath26  km s@xmath1 , obtained from 16 parallax and proper motion measurements @xcite , the peculiar velocity components are @xmath27  km s@xmath1 .",
    "quoted uncertainties are based on proper motion and @xmath28 measurement errors and also a 7  km s@xmath1  uncertainty in each peculiar velocity component , owing to expected virial motions of a star within a high mass star forming region .",
    "in the literature there are two estimates of distance to the source consistent with our direct measurement .",
    "@xcite derived a distance of 4.7  kpc for the h ii complex , based on the association to a co cloud with a lsr velocity of + 4  km s@xmath1  and following the expanding ring model of the 3  kpc - arm given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that there is hi absorption over the lsr velocity range of -5 to 55  km s@xmath1and suggested a kinematic distance of 5.7  kpc .",
    "our trigonometric parallax places at a distance close to 5.2 kpc .",
    "the combination of distance and galactic coordinates locates in the inner region of the galaxy within the so - called `` molecular ring '' , which appears as a complex structure in co longitude - velocity maps ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on the observations of distinct tangents points , traced by the early co surveys in the southern milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) , the inner edge of the molecular ring is thought to be composed of the norma and expanding 3  kpc arms ( e.g. figure  5 in @xcite ; figure  3 in @xcite ) . due to observational difficulties detecting and following the norma arm in co emission at positive longitudes , the question to which arm , if any , does the norma arm connect in the first quadrant is still controversial ( e.g. @xcite ) . therefore in the following ,",
    "we focus our comparison of the spatial and velocity properties of with the well - studied expanding 3  kpc - arm .",
    "since the lsr velocity for a nearly circular galactic orbit at the longitude and distance of would be @xmath29  km s@xmath1 , about 50  km s@xmath1  greater than observed , is clearly highly kinematically anomalous .",
    "we can gain a more complete picture of the region by comparing the galactic location ( @xmath30,_b _ ) and the lsr velocity ( + 2  km s@xmath1 ) of with respect to the distribution of co toward this region . using the longitude - velocity and latitude - velocity co  @xmath31 line maps of @xcite",
    ", we find the hmsfr associated with the edge of a co clump ( cutoff at 0.5  k ) .",
    "@xcite locate the expanding ( near ) 3  kpc - arm ( hereafter simply the 3  kpc - arm ) below the plane of the milky way at galactic longitude @xmath32 , whereas is slightly above the plane .",
    "the lsr velocity of the 3  kpc - arm in this direction is expected to be @xmath33  km s@xmath1 , blueshifted by about @xmath34  km s@xmath1  with respect to a circular orbit at @xmath35  km s@xmath1 .",
    "we find to have a @xmath36  km s@xmath1 , which , while close to the co velocity at this longitude , is shifted by about 15  km s@xmath1  with respect to co in the 3  kpc - arm .",
    "thus , may not be part of the 3  kpc - arm as previously proposed and , perhaps , could belong to a nearby structure such as the norma arm .",
    "either way , this source , and presumably its associated arm , has a large peculiar motion with a @xmath37  km s@xmath1  component radially outward and a @xmath38  km s@xmath1component counter to galactic rotation , rendering kinematic distances useless .",
    "the spatial and velocity properties of the hmsfr and the 3  kpc - arm , although not strictly associated , suggest they could participate in a similar dynamical anomaly .",
    "the large peculiar motion of the 3  kpc - arm might be induced by the gravitational influence of a central bar(s ) potential , as explored by many authors .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of maser stars in the inner milky way with respect to the ism distribution and compared their spatial properties with a set of orbits derived by combining an axisymmetric potential plus a weak rotating bar .",
    "they found an overall agreement between maser stars and gas in both space and velocity , moving inward along the galactic plane with almost circular orbits that become more and more elongated inside the molecular ring with radial motion increasingly important .",
    "following @xcite , they suggested the 3  kpc - arm to be the locus of ballistic orbits originating at the corotation radius of the bar . on the contrary ,",
    "@xcite modeling the dynamics of the milky way gas flow in the presence of a potential from two nested bars , suggested by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) data , reproduced the longitude - velocity features of the 3  kpc - arm as a spiral density wave maximum surrounding the primary bar . further",
    "parallax and 3-d velocity measurements of hmsfrs sampling the inner region of the galaxy will help to constraint the dynamics of this complex region .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that two supernova remnants ( snrs ) , g9.8 + 0.6 and g9.7 - 0.0 , are projected to within a half degree of .",
    "g9.8 + 0.6 has distance estimates of 8.8  kpc @xcite and 10.4  kpc @xcite , both based on the @xmath39-d relation , which may not be reliable ( e.g. @xcite ) , whereas the g9.7 - 0.0 has a near kinematic distance estimate ( 4.7  kpc ) based on an associated oh maser velocity ( + 43  km s@xmath1 ) detected toward the snr @xcite .",
