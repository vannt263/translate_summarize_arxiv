    "in low - mass neutron star x - ray binary ( nsxb ) systems , matter is accreted onto a neutron star from a companion via a disc which radiates in the optical , ultraviolet and x - ray regimes .",
    "some of the accreting matter and energy in x - ray binaries ( xbs ) can be released from the system through collimated outflows ( jets ) .",
    "evidence for jets associated with nsxbs date back more than a decade @xcite but not until recently has the evidence emerged from any waveband other than the radio .",
    "@xcite found that infrared @xmath7-band flaring in the ` z - source ' nsxb gx 17 + 2 could not be explained by an x - ray driven wind or reprocessed x - rays , but shared many properties with the radio ( i.e. jet ) variability previously seen in the same source .",
    "it is worth noting that the near - infrared ( nir ) counterpart of gx 13 + 1 is also largely variable @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite for the first time spectrally detected optically thin synchrotron emission from the jets of an ` atoll ' nsxb 4u 0614 + 09 in the mid - infrared .    in the optical regime , many spectral and timing studies of nsxbs have established the presence of an accretion disc reprocessing x - ray photons to optical wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in quiescence , the companion star can come to dominate the optical / nir ( oir ) emission ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , as is the case in high - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and low - mass x - ray binaries that accrete from a giant star .",
    "x - ray reprocessing is generally thought to dominate the oir emission of non - quiescent nsxbs ( see @xcite for a review ; see also @xcite ) . in low - mass black hole candidate x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) , additional oir emission mechanisms have been observed , in particular from the viscously heated disc ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from compact jets ( e.g. @xcite ; russell et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "recently , an anomalous transient nir excess has been observed in a number of millisecond x - ray pulsar ( msxp ) nsxbs at high luminosities , which is equivocal in nature .",
    "the source most studied is sax j1808.43658 , for which @xcite found a nir flux almost one order of magnitude too bright to originate from x - ray heating .",
    "the nir flux density was comparable to a radio detection of 0.8 mjy ( with a flat 2.58.6 ghz spectrum ) seen one week after the nir excess .",
    "@xcite also reported an @xmath8-band excess in a different outburst of the same source , which they attributed to synchrotron emission .",
    "in addition , a variable @xmath8- and @xmath9-band excess in xte j0929314 seen on the same day as a radio detection @xcite , and a transient nir excess in xte j1814338 @xcite and igr j00291 + 5934 @xcite were all interpreted as synchrotron emission from the jets in the systems .",
    "the nir excess appears to be ubiquitously absent at lower luminosities .",
    "steady , partially self - absorbed jets probably exist in low - magnetic field ( @xmath10 g ) nsxbs in hard x - ray states @xcite .",
    "these include ` atoll - type ' sources in the ` island ' state , ` z - type ' sources in the ` horizontal branch ' and possibly the ` normal branch ' and transients at low accretion rates ( @xmath11 ) such as msxps .",
    "@xcite shows on theoretical grounds that the existence of jets in nsxbs depends on the magnetic field and mass accretion rate , and the conditions required for jet ejection are probably fulfilled for most of the nsxbs ( z - sources , atolls and msxps ) with known magnetic field strengths . in russell",
    "et al . ( 2006 ; hereafter @xcite ) , we predicted that emission from the jets could contribute or even dominate the oir light of nsxbs at high x - ray luminosities , for sources in a hard x - ray state .",
    "this is expected if @xmath12 ( a theoretical relation supported by radio  x - ray observations ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath13 ( where xr is x - ray reprocessing in the disc ) , as is predicted and observed ( @xcite ) . in the sample of @xcite",
    "there were too little data at high x - ray luminosities to test this prediction for nsxbs .",
    "in this paper we analyse quasi - simultaneous oir and x - ray data and oir spectra of a large , comprehensive sample of nsxbs in order to constrain the @xmath14-dependent dominating oir emission processes and to test the above prediction .",
    "data are collected from transient nsxbs : atolls , msxps and z - sources .",
    "we use the technique @xcite of comparing the relations between the quasi - simultaneous oir and x - ray fluxes with the relations predicted from models of three oir emission processes : a viscously heated disc , an x - ray reprocessing disc and synchrotron - emitting jets .",
    "we also inspect the spectral index of the oir continuum , which differs largely between emission from the disc and from the jets .",
    "if the radio / oir jet behaviour is ubiquitous in nsxbs , its properties will constrain many parameters in these systems , in particular the power of the jets ( if the jet radiative efficiency can be constrained ) and the wavelength - dependent jet contribution at a given x - ray luminosity .",
    "a wealth of oir and x - ray data from atolls , z - sources and msxps were collected from the literature and converted to intrinsic luminosities ( or monochromatic luminosities ) in the same manner as described in section 2 of @xcite .",
    "much of the data we use here were obtained for @xcite , however we have sought additional quasi - simultaneous oir and x - ray data ( and oir spectral energy distributions ; seds , which were not collected for * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the purposes of obtaining a comprehensive sample for this work ( see tables 1 and 2 for the references of the new data ) .",
    "estimates of the distance to each source , the optical extinction @xmath15 and the hi absorption column @xmath16 used here are listed in table 2 of @xcite and table 1 of this paper .",
    "no data were included for which the oir contribution of the companion star could be significant ( i.e. quiescence for most sources ) unless this contribution is known .",
    "for these data we subtracted the star light contribution .",
    "for the z - sources , oir data were only included when the oir fluxes were significantly higher than the lowest measured for each source in each waveband , to ensure minimal contamination from the companion .",
    "when two or more oir wavebands were quasi - simultaneous , oir seds were produced in order to spectrally constrain the origin of the oir emission .",
    "in addition to the data collected from the literature , we obtained oir photometry of three nsxbs using two telescopes ; the observations and data reduction are discussed in the following subsections .",
    "while quasi - simultaneity was achieved in most cases with use of the _ rxte _ asm x - ray daily monitoring , this is not possible for some historical oir observations . in these cases",
    "we include the data only in the oir seds .",
    "similarly , for some sources oir  x - ray quasi - simultaneity was achieved , but there was only one oir waveband available so oir colours and seds were not obtained ( e.g. gx 17 + 2 ) . quasi - simultaneous oir ",
    "x - ray data were available for five sources ( lmc x2 , cyg x2 , cen x4 , 4u 0614 + 09 and aql x1 ) before the advent of the _ rxte _ @xcite .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the optical spectral index @xmath17 is generally positive for atolls and msxps ( fig . 3 lower panel ) , but decreases at @xmath18 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "we would expect @xmath17 to become negative at a higher x - ray luminosity than @xmath19 if the origin of the redder emission component is the jets .",
    "as the x - ray luminosity is increased , the optically thin synchrotron jet component will dominate over x - ray reprocessing in the nir bands before the optical as the jet component has a negative spectral index . at @xmath20 erg s@xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath17 is negative in 63 percent of the optical data of atolls / msxps . below @xmath21 erg s@xmath5 this is 7 percent .",
    "these few data in the latter group with @xmath22 are at low @xmath14 ( @xmath23 erg s@xmath5 ) and may be due to cooler accretion discs ( possibly like the bhxbs ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the mean uncertainty in the values of @xmath24 are fairly large , so we can only make conclusions from general trends and not individual data points .",
    "almost all of the spectra of the z - sources are blue ( @xmath25 ; fig",
    ". 3 lower panel ) .",
    "this supports the suggestion in section 3.1 that x - ray reprocessing dominates the oir of the z - sources due to their larger accretion discs and lower radio jet luminosities ( at a given @xmath14 ) .",
    "the z - sources can not be dominated by optically thin synchrotron emission as this requires @xmath26 .",
    "since the radio  oir spectrum of z - sources is @xmath27 ( section 3.1 ) , the optically thick part of the jet spectrum could dominate the oir if @xmath28 also ( although this requires the optically thick / thin break to be in the optical regime or bluer ) .",
    "@xmath29 is observed for most of the data from the z - sources ( fig",
    ". 3 lower panel ) , which implies this is not the case , however we can not rule out an optically thick jet origin to a few of the oir z - source data ( those with lower spectral index ) .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 shows how the optical and nir spectral index changes with @xmath30 .",
    "the z - source data in this panel have the largest values of @xmath30 . the expected level of oir emission from reprocessing in the disc in these systems is larger than that of the atolls / msxps due to their larger accretion discs and higher x - ray luminosities , further supporting the x - ray reprocessing scenario .",
    "the seds of individual sources in fig .",
    "4 allow us to see how the luminosity - dependent optical and nir spectral indices differ between sources .",
    "we group the panels in fig . 4 into the different types of nsxb : msxps in the upper panels , then atolls , then z - sources in the lower panels .",
    "one can visually see a nir excess ( @xmath26 ) joining a blue ( @xmath25 ) optical spectrum in the seds of four of the five msxps ( the ` v'-shape ) .",
    "this is indicative of two separate spectral components and is observed in at least three hard state bhxbs @xcite , where it is interpreted as the optically thin jet spectrum meeting the thermal spectrum of the accretion disc .",
    "the nir excess disappears at low luminosities in a total of four outbursts of three msxps ; no nir excess is seen below @xmath31 erg s@xmath5 hz@xmath5 in any msxp or in fact any nsxb .",
    "of the five atolls in fig . 4 , one ( aql x1 ; the atoll with the most data and highest luminosity ) has a negative spectral index ; more - so at high luminosity .",
    "there is little nir coverage of atolls in the literature ( at least at high luminosities ) and from the data we have , the oir seds are positive in all sources except aql x1 , consistent with the disc dominating the oir .",
    "the optical spectral index for aql x1 is very negative at the highest luminosities , suggesting all of the oir was dominated by the jets during the peak of the bright 1978 outburst of this source .",
    "the sed of 4u 0614 + 09 flattens ( becomes redder ) in the nir ; this is known to be where the disc spectrum meets that of the jet @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for a jet ( @xmath26 ) component contributing to the oir spectra of any of the seven z - sources in fig .",
    "4 . as was shown above",
    ", the jets should be oir - bright in z - sources but because of their larger discs , x - ray reprocessing dominates . for the new transient z - source xte j1701462 @xcite , the optical extinction is not well constrained and we show three seds in fig . 4 of the same data , using different values of @xmath15 to illustrate the possible range in spectral indices ( we have not included any data from xte j1701462 in the lower panels of figs . 2 or 3 because of these uncertainties in @xmath24 ) .      from the information gathered in sections 3.13.3",
    ", the picture is now emerging of the dominating oir emission processes for the different types of nsxb at different luminosities .",
    "for nsxbs at low luminosities ( @xmath32 erg s@xmath5 ) , the correlations and spectra are consistent with x - ray reprocessing dominating the oir .",
    "the data are inconsistent with emission from the jets at these luminosities",
    ".    we can rule out a viscously heated disc origin to the nir data of all nsxbs since that requires @xmath33 which is not observed ( fig .",
    "3 ) . similarly the viscous disc can not dominate the optical light of nsxbs at @xmath34 erg s@xmath5 but could below this luminosity as @xmath35 is required and observed .",
    "the jets dominate the nir and optical light of atolls / msxps above @xmath4 and @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 respectively , as the spectral indices of the continuum can not be explained by thermal emission .",
    "the seds of the transient nsxbs with the best sampling show the physical disappearance at low luminosity of a nir excess which is present at high luminosity .",
    "these observations are also consistent with the jet oir  x - ray model .    for z - sources , the oir",
    " x - ray relations and oir spectra are consistent with emission from x - ray reprocessing .",
    "the jets and viscously heated disc can be ruled out in most z - sources , however the optical and nir spectral indices in a few observations are also consistent with an optically thick jet which extends from the ( measured ) radio flux .",
    "we can make a direct measurement of the jet radio ",
    "nir spectral index for the atolls / msxps , using the nir data which are dominated by the jets . in the luminosity range",
    "@xmath36 erg s@xmath5 , the nir data with a negative spectral index is on average 0.70 dex more luminous than expected from the jet model ( which assumes a flat radio  nir spectrum ; we know the radio luminosity at this @xmath14 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . some low level contribution from the disc",
    "could only partly explain this excess . the corresponding radio ",
    "nir spectral index in that range of @xmath14 is @xmath37 ( 0.70 dex in luminosity divided by 4.5 dex in frequency between radio and nir ) .",
    "the optically thick to optically thin break frequency in nsxbs is thought to be in the mid - ir @xcite , making the optically thick radio  mid - ir jet spectrum more inverted ; @xmath38 . the spectral evidence for the existence of synchrotron - emitting jets in nsxbs presented in this paper ( and showed for the first time by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with radio detections which are sometimes resolved ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have direct implications for the local conditions and accretion processes in nsxbs . for example , according to @xcite , a jet can only occur if the magnetic field intensity and mass accretion rate are constrained thus : @xmath39    from table 1 of @xcite , msxps only satisfy this condition if we adopt the largest mass accretion rates and smallest magnetic field strengths measured .",
    "empirically we do see the jet only at high luminosities and hence high mass accretion rates .",
    "the atolls and z - sources more easily satisfy the condition for jet production , except for the highest magnetic field strengths measured in z - sources . since we know jets exist in all three flavours of nsxb at least at high luminosities , perhaps the measured mass accretion rates and magnetic field strengths are under- and over - estimated respectively , in some cases .",
    "we have shown that the dominating oir emission processes in nsxbs vary with x - ray luminosity and between source types ( atolls / msxps and z - sources ) .",
    "however , a clearer picture seems to emerge than the dominating emission processes of bhxbs @xcite .",
    "models predict that x - ray reprocessing in the accretion disc should dominate the oir at low luminosities and the jets , if present , should dominate at high luminosities for nsxbs with relatively small accretion discs .    from the observed spectral index of the oir continuum and from oir",
    " x - ray relations we show that this is the case in atolls and msxps : the jets dominate the nir and optical emission above @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 , respectively . below these luminosities",
    "x - ray reprocessing dominates , although we can not rule out a viscously heated disc origin to the optical emission .",
    "we have shown that the radio  nir spectral index of the jets in the atolls / msxps is slightly inverted : @xmath37 , at least at high x - ray luminosities ( @xmath40@xmath41 erg s@xmath5 ) . in the z - sources , which have larger discs , we find that x - ray reprocessing is responsible for all oir emission , and the radio  oir jet spectrum has to be @xmath42 ( otherwise the jet spectrum would dominate over the disc )",
    ". however , the optically thick part of the jet spectrum could dominate in a few cases .",
    "evidence for the existence of nsxb jets is mounting both from radio detections ( which are sometimes resolved ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectrally from higher frequency observations ( migliari et al .",
    "2006 ; this paper ) .",
    "the power carried in nsxb jets is sensitive to the position of the break between optically thick and thin emission in its spectrum , and is currently a topic of debate .",
    "this is constrained in 4u 0614 + 09 @xcite , where it is likely to lie in the mid - infrared .",
    "mid - infrared and nir photometry and polarimetry could shed light on this ; optically thin synchrotron emission is expected to be highly polarised if the magnetic field is ordered .    _",

    "<S> optical / near - infrared ( optical / nir ; oir ) light from low - mass neutron star x - ray binaries ( nsxbs ) in outburst is traditionally thought to be thermal emission from the accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> here we present a comprehensive collection of quasi - simultaneous oir and x - ray data from 19 low - magnetic field nsxbs , including new observations of three sources : 4u 0614 + 09 , lmc x2 and gx 349 + 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the average radio  oir spectrum for nsxbs is @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 ) at least at high luminosities when the radio jet is detected . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to , but slightly more inverted than the @xmath2 found for black hole x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the oir spectra and relations between oir and x - ray fluxes are compared to those expected if the oir emission is dominated by thermal emission from an x - ray or viscously heated disc , or synchrotron emission from the inner regions of the jets . </S>",
    "<S> we find that thermal emission due to x - ray reprocessing can explain all the data except at high luminosities for some nsxbs , namely the atolls and millisecond x - ray pulsars ( msxps ) . </S>",
    "<S> optically thin synchrotron emission from the jets ( with an observed oir spectral index of @xmath3 ) dominate the nir light above @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and the optical above @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 in these systems . for nsxb </S>",
    "<S> z - sources , the oir observations can be explained by x - ray reprocessing alone , although synchrotron emission may make a low level contribution to the nir , and could dominate the oir in one or two cases .    </S>",
