    "the existence of two classes of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) differing in observed durations and spectral properties has been established for some time .",
    "these populations were quantified using the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) , which showed a bimodal distribution in the durations of grbs well fit by two lognormal functions @xcite , with the divide at @xmath5s @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is also contamination in the short burst class from soft gamma - ray repearters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that long grbs have their origins in massive star progenitors because of their association with core - collapse supernovae and occurrence in star - forming galaxies @xcite and in highly star - forming regions therein @xcite .",
    "the origin of short grbs is still open , with mergers of compact objects being the leading concept ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of the spectroscopic signatures of sne in the 4 nearest grbs and the detection of bumps consistent with sne in the lightcurves of most low - redshift bursts seemed to confirm the paradigm that all long grbs would be associated with sne , as predicted by the collapsar model of long grbs .",
    "doubts were cast on this paradigm by the non - detection of sne in two nearby grbs , grb060505 at @xmath6 @xcite and grb060614 at @xmath7 @xcite discovered by the _ swift _ @xcite burst alert telescope ( bat , * ? ? ? * ) . due to their long durations , @xmath8 of @xmath9s and @xmath10s",
    "respectively @xcite , sn searches were initiated .",
    "although a supernova @xmath11100 times fainter than sn1998bw would have been detected , none was found in either case @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that they were short bursts where the lack of sne would not be surprising , as short grbs have not shown sn emission .",
    "the classification of grbs with durations close to the long / short division is problematic .",
    "the argument that grb060614 was a ",
    "short grb \" rests on its extended soft emission component and on its negligible spectral lag @xcite .",
    "when the latter is combined with its relatively low luminosity , it violates the lag - luminosity relation found by @xcite for long grbs .",
    "if the lack of a sn in grb060505 is to be attributed to it being a short burst , it should also have a negligible lag .",
    "we present the spectral lag analysis of the prompt emission of grb060505 using data from the _ suzaku _ wide area monitor ( wam ) and _ swift_-bat .",
    "[ fig : wawlightcurves ]    grb060505 was detected by the bat instrument on _ swift_. the fluence is ( 6.2@xmath121.1)@xmath13 ergs @xmath14 ( 15 - 150kev ) and the spectrum is fit by a power law with index 1.3@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the trigger fell below the 6.5@xmath16 threshold for an automatic slew but ground analysis found a 8.5@xmath16 excess @xcite . _",
    "swift _ was repointed at t@xmath17 + 0.6  days and a weak fading x - ray source was identified @xcite .",
    "we obtained the publicly available data for grb060505 from the @xmath3 archive .",
    "a mask weighted lightcurve was generated using the bat data analysis tools .",
    "the available data contained only 10s of event data and the lightcurve is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : batlightcurves ] .",
    "@xmath3 was approaching the south atlantic anomaly when the burst occurred and was subject to a higher than normal background level .",
    "additionally , the partial coding was only 11% @xcite meaning that the off - axis angle with respect to the @xmath3 axis was almost 50@xmath18 , substantially reducing the effective area of the instrument . splitting the data into energy channels for spectral lag analysis",
    "further reduces the weak signal .",
    "the wam is the anti - coincidence shield ( acs ) of the hard x - ray detector on @xmath2 @xcite and it also triggered on grb060505 .",
    "the wam consists of four identical walls which act as individual detectors ( wam0 to wam3 ) .",
    "the detectors have a large effective area @xcite .",
    "they are sensitive in the energy range 505000kev , and although its primary role is to act as an acs , wam is also used as an all - sky monitor for grbs .",
    "an automated triggering system operates on board @xcite and the lightcurves are publicly available at 15.6ms resolution in 4 rough energy bands 50110 , 110240 , 240520 , 5205000kev .",
    "the lightcurves in the four energy channels from the wam0 detector at 100ms resolution are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : wawlightcurves ] .",
    "the t@xmath19 of grb060505 was @xmath114.8  s in the 505000kev band@xmath20 .",
    "the burst struck the wam detector at an angle such that principally wam0 , but also to a lesser extent wam3 , detected the burst .",
    "the on - axis effective area of the bat and wam instruments are shown in fig .",
    "2 of @xcite and the effective area of wam only exceeds that of bat above 300kev .",
    "however , it should be remembered that grb060505 occurred @xmath21 off - axis in bat and that the effective area of bat also drops rapidly above 100kev .",
    "these factors result in a more significant detection grb060505 by wam than bat and therefore we rely primarily on the wam data for our analysis .",
    "however , we show that the results are consistent with those obtained from the bat data .",
    "the spectral lag was calculated by cross - correlating the lightcurves in different energy channels ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) was fit with a fourth order polynomial and the quoted lag value is the peak of this function .",
    "statistical errors were calculated using a bootstrap method as described in @xcite .",
    "this involves adding poissonian noise based on the observed counts to the lightcurves in the different energy channels and re - computing the ccf in 100 realisations for each burst .",
    "the 50th ranked value is the mean lag and the 16th and 84th ranked values represent @xmath22 .",
    "the spectral lag was determined between the 50110 and 110240kev ( @xmath23 ) energy bands for the @xmath2 wam detectors over a range of temporal resolutions ( 15.6 , 31.2 , 46.8 , 62.4 , 78 and 100ms ) .",
    "the lightcurves were correlated from @xmath244 to + 4s and the ccf was fit over a range of @xmath115s .",
    "a lightcurve threshold of 10% ( 30% ) is applied , which means that only data with at least one - tenth ( three - tenths ) of the peak count rate is used to calculate the lag , thus reducing the background .",
    "the spectral lag values obtained from wam0 at the six time resolutions specified above at 10% threshold agree within the uncertainties and the average value is @xmath25s . applying the 30% threshold to the same lightcurves , increases the average value to 0.44@xmath26s and all values are within @xmath27 of those obtained at the 10% threshold except at 60ms and 78ms , which are consistent at the @xmath28 level . above the 50% threshold the results are unreliable and",
    "the lag is not accurately reproduced .",
    "the burst is detected with lower significance in wam3 and does not allow an accurate determination of the lag .",
    "we add the signal from wam3 to that of wam0 to test if this gives a consistent result .",
    "the results are consistent with wam0 alone within @xmath29 , except at 100ms resolution where the wam0 + 3 lag is larger but is consistent at @xmath30 with the wam0 results ( 10% threshold ) .",
    "the average value obtained from the sum of the wam0 and wam3 lightcurves is 0.42@xmath120.05s and 0.47@xmath31s at 10% and 30% thresholds respectively .",
    "the cross correlation data and fit for wam0 at 100ms is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccfswam]a and is inconsistent with the negligible lag expected for a short burst .",
    "a precursor is evident in the wam data at @xmath248s and including it in the lag analysis over a wider time range results in a consistent lag measurement of 0.47@xmath32s .",
    "we note that precursors are not normally detected in short bursts .",
    "the lag was also measured between the 2550kev and 50100kev energy bands ( @xmath33 ) at 100ms using the bat data with the techniques outlined above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ccfswam]b ) .",
    "the lightcurve was too weak to determine the lag at finer time resolution .",
    "the spectral lag value of 0.4@xmath120.1s measured using the bat data is consistent within @xmath34 with that obtained from the wam0 and wam0 + 3 .    in order to establish the robustness of our result",
    ", we determined the lag for 16 additional grbs detected by both bat and wam , for which the lightcurve data were sufficient for lag analysis in both instruments .",
    "the analysis was performed in a similar manner to grb060505 .",
    "the derived lags ranged from @xmath243ms to 0.94s in the wam and 0 to 0.86s in the bat .",
    "the lags are compatible considering the differing instruments and off - axis angles , energy ranges and the spectra of the bursts , except in 2 cases where the bat lag was significantly longer .",
    "the sample consisted of 12 long and 4 short bursts .",
    "crucially , the short bursts were always found to have negligible lag in both instruments .",
    "this shows that our analysis is sensitive to short lags .",
    "using batse data , @xcite and @xcite found that long duration grbs had both measurable and zero lags but that short grbs had lags around zero .",
    "@xcite calculated the lags of 260 short grbs using batse data and found that 9095% of the values were consistent with zero and suggest that bursts with positive lag may result from contamination by the long grb class .",
    "it was also argued that if short grbs had lags proportionally as large as long grbs , such lags would be detectable , i.e.  that this result was not simply an effect of the duration of short bursts .",
    "this is not to say that bursts with short lags are necessarily in the short grb class . in the sample of published lags of batse data by @xcite ,",
    "1427 bursts have @xmath35s and a measured lag ( @xmath36 ) . of these bursts 214 have lags in the range from @xmath37 to @xmath38ms ( 79 with uncertainties of @xmath39ms ) and 348 have lags in the range from @xmath40 to @xmath41ms ( 217 with uncertainties of @xmath42ms ) , showing that there are many long grbs with very short lag . in summary ,",
    "long bursts are expected to have predominantly positive lags ranging from zero to several seconds .",
    "short grbs have almost exclusively negligible lags .",
    "however , it is not possible to exclude that grb060505 could be an outlier : i.e. a short duration grb with a positive lag or due to a process which does not fit into the lag classification scheme .",
    "there have been difficulties in classifying a number of bursts and the lag has been used to discriminate in a number of cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , grb060912a has a t@xmath19 of @xmath43s and was initially thought to have occurred in a nearby elliptical galaxy , however @xcite recently found that it was more likely to come from a star forming galaxy at @xmath44 and report a lag ( @xmath45 ) of @xmath46ms .",
    "various strategies have been proposed to distinguish bursts more effectively than the duration alone ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , none have seen widespread adoption .",
    "it was argued that grb060505 was probably part of the tail of the short burst population and connected to mergers of compact objects . at a redshift of @xmath47=0.089",
    ", grb060505 has an isotropic peak luminosity of @xmath48 ( 50 - 300kev ) . having a low luminosity and relatively long lag of 0.36@xmath49s",
    ", grb060505 falls below the lag - luminosity relation of  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lag - lum ] .",
    "the spectral lag of grb 060505 is significantly longer than those measured for short grbs and grb060614 and it falls on the lag - luminosity plot in a position similar to that of some ( but not all ) sn - grbs ( e.g. grb031203 ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the simplest interpretation for grb060505 is that it is related to a merger event rather than a short - lived massive star and point out that the maximum allowable distance of grb060505 from a star - forming knot is consistent with the shortest merger timescales .",
    "@xcite claim that grb060505 occurred in a star forming region of the host galaxy which resembles long grb host galaxies and argue for a massive star origin for this event .",
    "it has also been argued that the host galaxy of grb060505 is more similar a short burst host in terms of metallicity and ionisation state @xcite .",
    "however , their short grb host region in the emission line ratio diagram is based on only two burst host galaxies , one of which is the grb 050416a , which has photometric evidence for an associated sn @xcite and is argued to be a long grb due its spectral softness and location on the amati plot @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy studies alone do not resolve the classification issue for grb060505 .",
    "the optical luminosity at 12 hours in the source frame is similar to those of short grb afterglows , but optical luminosity alone is also not a valid classification tool @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "the lag measurement suggests that this burst is similar to long grbs implying a massive star progenitor , despite the lack of a sn detection .",
    "it has been argued that the absence of a sn signature in grb060505 is evidence of a new , quiet endpoint for some massive stars @xcite .",
    "the existence of a sn was a feature of the early collapsar model .",
    "however , the complete absence of a sn may be expected where the @xmath50ni does not have sufficient impetus to escape the black hole @xcite or in jet - induced explosions with narrow jets when the deposited energy is small @xcite .",
    "progenitor stars with relatively low angular momentum could also produce grbs without supernovae @xcite .",
    "these seem attractive explanations at least for grb060505 . in the absence of a grb explosion , the detection of such quiet - death massive stars , if they exist , is a challenge for current instrumentation ( e.g. * ? ? ?"
