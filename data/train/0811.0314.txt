    "he pointed out that the specific magnetic field strengths where they occur should be avoided to achieve a stable cryogenically cooled h gas , in view of an enhanced decay at resonance . in 1992",
    "one of the present authors ( bjv ) and co - workers pointed to a positive aspect of such feshbach resonances @xcite : they allow for an easy control of the interaction strength between _ ultracold _ atoms , i.e. , atoms in the energy range where their interaction is limited to s - waves . in such circumstances , the interaction strength is characterized by the s - wave scattering length @xmath0 . with a feshbach resonance ,",
    "the interactions can be tuned from weak to strong and from attractive to repulsive by simply changing an externally applied magnetic field .    since",
    "then these resonances have become an indispensable tool in many successful attempts to control the interatomic interaction , to form ultracold molecules by associating atoms , and to create a superfluid fermi gas .",
    "feshbach resonances allow experiments with ultracold atoms access to a multitude of the most diverse many - body phenomena  @xcite .",
    "systematic theoretical work to determine resonant field strengths and scattering lengths for almost all stable alkali atoms started immediately after 1992  @xcite and played a crucial role in the first realizations of bose - einstein condensation bec in 1995  @xcite ( we will use the term alkali atom in reference to an alkali metal ) .",

    "potentials do not possess the required accuracy at short range .",
    "the slightest change of a potential in that range can easily turn a positive into a negative scattering length , information which is crucial for instance to predict the stability of a bec .",
    "a way to account for that is to summarize the `` history '' of the collision for interatomic distances @xmath1 smaller than a separation radius @xmath2 by means of a boundary condition on the wave function at @xmath2 , and to determine that condition from a restricted set of available experimental data  @xcite .",
    "the basic philosophy of this approach is to give up the goal of extracting the detailed short - range potential as a whole from experiment in favor of a boundary condition with only a few parameters .",
    "the boundary condition takes the form of a radial phase of the zero - energy wave function accumulated in the interval @xmath3 in either the singlet or the triplet channel , and its energy and angular momentum derivatives .",
    "this presupposes pure singlet and triplet wave functions , which is justified for small interatomic distances where the singlet and triplet states are far enough apart in energy to neglect hyperfine mixing .    over the years",
    "the accuracy of the description of scattering properties obtained with this method has shown a dramatic improvement , keeping pace with the accuracy of the measurements . in this paper",
    "we describe an extension of the accumulated phase method , the _ adiabatic _ accumulated phase method , presented briefly in a previous publication  @xcite , in which the hyperfine interaction is not completely neglected , but taken into account adiabatically for @xmath4 .",
    "it enables one to describe the interaction and scattering of ( ultra)cold atoms to unprecedented precision .",
    "it is also unparalleled in comprehensiveness : it allows the prediction of a large and varied set of experimental data , once the accumulated phase parameters have been determined from a restricted set of experimental data .",
    "we thus refrain from extracting the short range , deep part of the central interaction potentials , singlet and triplet , in favor of predicting new scattering properties . as such",
    ", it sets an example for future `` state of the art '' applications to other atoms , in particular to interactions between unlike atomic species .",

    "the hyperfine term can be written as the sum of two parts with different symmetry with respect to interchange of the electronic or nuclear spins , @xmath46 the convenience of this splitting arises from the fact that @xmath47 is diagonal in @xmath48 , whereas @xmath49 , being antisymmetric in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , is the part coupling singlet and triplet states .",
    "for the interactions mentioned up to now the total hamiltonian @xmath52 is invariant under independent rotations of the spin system and the orbital system around the axis through the overall center of mass parallel to the magnetic field .",

    "as mentioned before , both parts of the spin - spin interaction are relatively weak . in most applications",
    "they can safely be neglected . that these interactions can not always be neglected is illustrated by the observation of feshbach resonances in @xmath76cs  @xcite and @xmath8rb  @xcite experiments in which colliding ultracold atoms , approaching each other in an @xmath9-wave , resonate with an @xmath58=2 or even @xmath58=4 ( quasi-)bound state coupled via the spin - spin interaction to the entrance channel ( in the @xmath58=4 case this interaction is needed twice : @xmath9-wave @xmath77 @xmath78-wave @xmath77 @xmath79-wave ) .",
