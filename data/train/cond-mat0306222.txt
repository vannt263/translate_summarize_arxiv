    "in discrete event simulations a physical system with stochastic dynamics is modeled on a lattice of discrete points , and changes of its state are viewed as discrete events in time .",
    "physical processes interact with each other at various points in simulation time .",
    "the stochastic nature of these interactions makes it difficult to utilize a parallel computing environment to the fullest extent because _ a priori _ there is no global clock to synchronize physical processes .",
    "examples of such complex systems with underlying asynchronous dynamics come from a wide range of fields , such as , activated processes in chemistry , contact processes in epidemiology and ecology models , population dynamics , finance markets , communication networks and internet traffic , to mention a few . in physics",
    "an important example is an interacting spin system , where stochastic processes can be simulated with a dynamic monte carlo approach . until recently a common belief in the physics community was that even the simplest random - site update monte carlo schemes @xcite were inherently serial .",
    "a popular parallelization technique for these systems is the so - called  trivial parallelization \" , in which each processor carries a copy of the full system .",
    "an obvious limitation of this technique is imposed by the memory requirement , which may exceed available resources for a large - scale simulation . in non - trivial parallelization",
    ", a system is spatially partitioned into subsystems , and each subsystem is placed on a different processor . in other words , in this way _ physical processes _ and physical interactions between subsystems are mapped to _ logical processes _ and logical dependences between processing elements . each logical process manages the state of the assigned physical subsystem and progresses in its own local virtual time ( lvt ) .",
    "the asynchronous nature of the physical dynamics implies an asynchronous system of logical processes where discrete events are not synchronized by a global clock .",
    "logical processes execute concurrently and exchange time - stamped messages to perform state updates of the entire physical system being simulated .",
    "a sufficient condition for preserving causality in simulations ( the so - called local causality constraint ) requires that each logical process works out the received messages from other logical processes in nondecreasing time - stamp order @xcite .",
    "parallel discrete event simulations ( pdes ) are classified in two broad categories : conservative pdes and optimistic pdes .",
    "in conservative pdes , originally studied by chandry and misra @xcite and introduced by lubachevsky in the study of dynamic ising spin systems @xcite , an algorithm does not allow a logical process to advance its lvt ( i.e. , to proceed with computations ) until it is certain that no causality violation can occur .",
    "in the conservative update scenario a logical process may have to be blocked and wait to ensure that no message with a lower time - stamp is received later .",
    "recent physics applications of conservative pdes in modeling magnetization switching @xcite , ballistic particle deposition @xcite , and a dynamic phase transition in highly anisotropic thin - film ferromagnets @xcite suggest that the conservative algorithm should be very efficient in simulating the dynamics of complex systems with short - range interactions . in optimistic pdes @xcite ,",
    "originated by jefferson s time warp algorithm @xcite , an algorithm allows a logical process to advance its lvt regardless of the possibility of a causality error that may happen in the case of receiving a message with a lower time - stamp than the local clock .",
    "the optimistic scenario detects causality errors and provides a recovery procedure from the violation of the local causality constraint by rolling back the events that have been processed prematurely .",
    "although there are no general performance studies to date that would provide an unbiased comparison of the two groups of algorithms , a common perception is that an optimistic pdes should outperform a conservative pdes .",
    "however , in the context of physics applications to ising spin systems , recent numerical studies by sloot _ et al_. @xcite demonstrate that near the ising critical temperature , where long - range correlations occur in the physical spin system being modeled , the computational complexity of an optimistic pdes and the physical complexity of the modeled system are entangled , leading to a nonlinear increase of the roll - back length and a sudden deterioration of the run - time behavior when the number of computing processors is increased .",
    "there are several aspects of pdes algorithms that should be considered in systematic efficiency studies .",
    "some important aspects are : the synchronization procedures , the utilization of the parallel environment as measured by the fraction of working processors , memory requirements , inter - processor communications handling , scalability as measured by evaluating the performance when the number of computing processors becomes large , and the speed - up as measured by comparing the performance with sequential des . in routinely performed studies to date , the efficiency is investigated in a heuristic fashion by testing the performance of a selected application in a chosen pdes environment ( i.e. , in a parallel simulator ) .",
    "recently , korniss _",
    "et al_. @xcite introduced a novel and powerful approach in which a pdes algorithm can be studied in an abstract way by extracting key features of the algorithm , simulating its performance , and applying the methods of non - equilibrium surface growth @xcite to evaluate its theoretical efficiency . in the korniss _",
    "et al_. approach , the main concept is the simulated time horizon ( sth ) , defined as the collection of lvts of all logical processes .",
    "the growth rule of this virtual time surface is defined by the communication rule among logical processes ( i.e. , by their communication topology , which in turn is defined by the underlying dynamics of the physical system being simulated ) and by the way in which the algorithm handles the advances in lvts . in this picture , the utilization of the parallel environment is evaluated as the mean density of local update sites of the growing time interface , and the width of the interface at saturation provides a measure of desynchronization that is directly related to the memory requirements @xcite .",
    "scalability properties of a pdes algorithm can be assessed from these performance simulation studies @xcite .    in the study of the sth generated by a conservative pdes @xcite",
    ", it has been determined that in the worst - case conservative scenario for a closed spin chain , when each processing element ( pe ) carries only one spin site ( i.e. , each logical process simply corresponds to the flipping of one spin ) and communicates only with its nearest neighbors , the time evolution of the sth on coarse - grained scales is governed by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) stochastic equation @xcite .",
    "this proves , by universality arguments , that the simulation phase of conservative pdes is asymptotically scalable , which guarantees a nonzero utilization even for an infinite number of pes . using the same argument",
    ", it has been shown that the sth becomes infinitely rough in the limit of an infinite number of pes , which suggests possible difficulties with data management .",
    "thus , the measurement phase of conservative pdes is not asymptotically scalable @xcite .",
    "recent simulation studies @xcite show that conservative pdes can be made fully scalable when the algorithm is supplemented with either a moving time window constraint @xcite or additional scale - free communication patterns between pes @xcite .    from the physics point of view",
    ", the virtual time surface of the generic conservative pdes , with its morphology and dynamics , can be viewed as a surface growing through deposition of random time increments in accordance with a growth rule defined by a generic conservative pdes update rule .",
    "the physics of this growth is reflected in the utilization ( the fraction of non - idling pes ) that corresponds to the mean number of deposition events on the surface . in the case of a closed spin chain",
    "this is equivalent to the mean density of local minima in the interface .",
    "it should be possible , at least for steady - state simulations , to make an explicit connection between the utilization and the microscopic structure of the interface .",
    "such a connection would enable rigorous studies of the update statistics and a closed theoretical formula for the utilization .",
    "the coarse - grained methods previously applied to this problem @xcite provide a proof of asymptotic scaling properties in the limit of a large number of pes .",
    "because of their continuum nature they can not give a detailed microscopic description of the interface ; neither is it certain if their results are valid for statistically feasible moderate to large numbers of pes . on the other hand",
    ", the mean utilization strictly depends on the microscopic structure of the sth . in this paper",
    "we explore the connection between the sth interface morphology on the micro - scale and the update statistics by addressing the above questions .",

    "here we derive formulas for the theoretical utilization and the theoretical probability distribution of updates in the system within an approximate model .",

    "the idea may be generally applied to any surface that grows on a lattice by a known growth rule . when the growth recipe is known , it is possible to construct diagrams of local lattice - site configurations and to translate the rule to dependences among the graphs .",
