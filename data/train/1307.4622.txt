    "good knowledge of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and density is important for us to understand a wide range of physical phenomena . to understand the evolution of the early universe in the first few seconds , we need the nature of the qcd phase transition at temperature @xmath5mev and nearly vanishing baryon density . on the other hand , to understand the physics of compact stars , we need the knowledge of the equation of state and dynamics of qcd matter at high baryon density and low temperature .",
    "lattice simulation of qcd at finite temperature and vanishing density has been successfully performed . however , at large baryon density the lattice simulation has not yet been successfully done due to the sign problem  @xcite : the fermion determinant is not positively definite in the presence of a nonzero baryon chemical potential @xmath6 .    to study the nature of strongly interacting matter at finite density , we thus look for some special theories that possess a positively definite fermion determinant .",
    "one case is the so - called qcd - like theories at finite baryon density  @xcite , where quarks are in a real or pseudoreal representation of the gauge group , including two - color qcd with quarks in the fundamental representation and qcd with quarks in the adjoint representation .",
    "while these theories are not real qcd , they can be simulated on the lattice  @xcite and may give us some information of real qcd at finite baryon density .",
    "another interesting case is real qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath0  @xcite , where the chemical potentials for light @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks have opposite signs and hence the fermion determinant is positively definite .",
    "chiral perturbation theory and other effective models predict a continuous quantum phase transition from the vacuum to the matter phase at @xmath0 equal to the pion mass @xmath3  @xcite , in contrast to the finite @xmath9 case , where the phase transition takes place at @xmath6 approximately equal to the nucleon mass @xmath10 .",
    "this transition has also been verified by lattice simulations of qcd at finite isospin chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "the resulting matter near the quantum phase transition is a dilute bose condensate of pions with weakly repulsive interactions  @xcite .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) phenomenon is believed to widely exist in dense strongly interacting matter .",
    "for example , pions or kaons can condense in neutron star matter if the electron chemical potential exceeds the effective mass for the pions or kaons  @xcite .",
    "however , the condensation of pions and kaons in neutron star matter is rather complicated due to the meson - nucleon interactions in dense nuclear medium . on the other hand , at asymptotically high density , perturbative qcd calculations show that the ground state of dense qcd is a weakly coupled bcs superfluid with the condensation of overlapping cooper pairs @xcite . for qcd at finite isospin density , it is interesting that the dense bcs superfluid and the dilute pion condensate have the same symmetry - breaking pattern and thus are continued with one another@xcite .",
    "they are both characterized by the nonzero expectation value @xmath11 . in condensed matter physics , this phenomenon was first discussed by eagles  @xcite and leggett  @xcite and is now called bec - bcs crossover@xcite . the bec - bcs crossover in dense relativistic systems as well as in dense qcd matter",
    "has been extensively studied in recent years  @xcite .",
    "while the two - flavor effective models of qcd may be sufficient to describe the phenomenon of pion condensation at finite isospin density , it is interesting to study the roles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the u@xmath1 anomaly .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite with quarks as elementary blocks , which describes well the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking and low - energy phenomenology of the qcd vacuum , is generally believed to work at low and moderate temperatures and densities  @xcite .",

    "it is well known that the kobayashi - maskawa-t hooft ( kmt ) term , which mimics the u@xmath1 anomaly in the njl model , is crucial to describe the @xmath12 mass splitting and therefore the meson spectra of qcd  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to study the meson spectra at finite isospin chemical potential , we need to consider the kmt term .",
    "the lagrangian density of the three - flavor nambu  jona - lasinio model is given by  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the quark field and @xmath15 represents the current quark mass matrix @xmath16 . in this work",

    "however , in real qcd the flavor symmetry ( in the chiral limit @xmath25 ) is broken down to @xmath26 due to the @xmath27 anomaly . in the njl model , this can be realized by adding the so - called kmt term @xmath28 to the lagrangian density .",

    "we shall present a systematic study of this model at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "the above three - flavor njl model also enables us to study the behavior of the topological susceptibility @xmath4 at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "the topological susceptibility @xmath4 is a fundamental correlation function in qcd and is the key to understanding much of the distinctive dynamics in the u@xmath1 channel .",
    "the general expression of @xmath4 to the leading order in the @xmath31 expansion at finite temperature and vanishing chemical potentials for the three - flavor njl model has been derived by fukushima _",
    "et al . _",
    "it was shown that the temperature effect suppresses the topological susceptibility @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , the finite - temperature behavior of the topological susceptibility can also be determined by lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the u@xmath1 anomaly strength @xmath30 in the njl model may be determined by using the lattice data .",
    "a relatively small @xmath30 at large temperature may signal an effective restoration of the u@xmath1 anomaly . in this paper",

    "our model prediction may be tested by future lattice simulations , and the @xmath2 dependence of the u@xmath1 anomaly strength @xmath30 may also be determined by using our expression of @xmath4 .",

    "we summarize in sec .",
    "to study the three - flavor njl model at finite chemical potentials and temperature , we introduce the chemical potential matrix @xmath32 , where @xmath33 here @xmath9 , @xmath2 and @xmath34 are referred to as the baryon chemical potential , isospin chemical potential , and strangeness chemical potential , respectively . at finite temperature and chemical potentials ,",

    "some pseudoscalar condensates may arise , corresponding to the condensation of pions and kaons .",
