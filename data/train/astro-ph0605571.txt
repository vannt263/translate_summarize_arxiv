    "gravitational lensing is a unique tool for exploring cosmology and the structures of astronomical objects .",
    "the well - understood physics of lensing makes it straightforward to use as a cosmological probe .",
    "moreover , it is the only method that probes distributions of dark matter directly , since gravitational lensing is a purely gravitational phenomenon .    while detailed investigations of single intriguing lens systems are useful for cosmological and astrophysical applications , for some studies it is essential to do statistical analyses of a complete sample of lenses that are selected from a well - understood source population .",
    "for instance , strong lens probabilities are sensitive to the volume element of the universe , and thus the amplitude of the cosmological constant , thus we can constrain cosmological models by comparing the observed lensed fraction in a catalog of distant sources to theoretical expectations @xcite . strong lensing probabilities at the cluster mass scale probe the abundance and mass distribution of clusters @xcite .",
    "the lens image separation distribution from galaxy to cluster mass scales can be used to study baryon cooling in dark halos @xcite and the connection between galaxy luminosities and masses of host halos @xcite .",
    "a statistical sample is important not only for studies of lensing rates , but also for interpretations of the results of individual lens modeling .",
    "it has been argued that lensing objects may be more or less atypical in their shapes , orientations @xcite , and environments @xcite because of strong dependences of lensing probabilities on these quantities .",
    "therefore we must take proper account of lensing biases to make a fair comparison between theory and observed results , which can only be accomplished for a well - defined statistical lens sample .",
    "a similar argument holds for constraints from stacked samples of strong lenses , including the structure and evolution of early - type galaxies @xcite and the fraction of substructures in lens galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is quite hard to estimate the degree of the lensing biases if one adopts a heterogeneous sample of lenses that have been discovered in a variety of ways .",
    "the current largest complete sample of strong lenses was selected from a radio survey : the cosmic - lens all sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has discovered 22 gravitational lenses from @xmath516,000 radio sources .",
    "13 of these lenses out of @xmath59,000 flat - spectrum radio sources constitute a statistically well - defined sample .",
    "recent progress on large - scale optical surveys has made it possible to construct comparable or even larger lens samples in the optical band .",
    "in particular , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is expected to identify @xmath5100,000 confirmed quasars @xcite and @xmath5500,000 photometrically selected quasars @xcite when completed .",
    "in addition to the large number of sources , the optical lens survey has the advantage of a source population whose redshift and magnitude distributions are well understood , which is important when doing statistical analyses . on the other hand ,",
    "optical lensed quasars are sometimes significantly affected by the light from foreground lens galaxies and dust reddening .",
    "therefore , optical and radio lens surveys contain different systematics , and it is thus of great importance to compare the results from these two complementary lens samples .",
    "we are searching for optical gravitationally lensed quasars from the imaging and spectroscopic data of the sdss to construct a statistical sample of lensed quasars . indeed",
    ", this project , the sdss quasar lens search ( sqls ) , has already discovered 14 new lensed quasars , and has recovered several ( @xmath6 ) previously known lensed quasars @xcite .",
    "although these lenses do not constitute a statistically well - defined sample , these discoveries give promise that we can create a large complete sample of lensed quasars . in order to construct a statistical sample ,",
    "we need ( i ) to select lens candidates by a homogeneous method , and ( ii ) to understand the completeness of the method . in reality",
    ", we must also keep the efficiency reasonably high to assure the feasibility of follow - up observations .",
    "we can take advantage of the deep sdss imaging data in five broad bands for the efficient identification of lensed quasar candidates .",
    "* hereafter p03 ) presented a selection method for lensed quasars from the sdss , and quantified its selection function .",
    "their selection algorithm compares the chi - square value of a two - component point - spread function ( psf ) model of spectroscopically confirmed sdss quasars with that of a one - component psf model . from simulated sdss images",
    ", they found that the algorithm recovers quasar pairs of similar fluxes down to separations of @xmath7 .    in this paper , we present another efficient algorithm to identify low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) lensed quasar candidates from the spectroscopic sample of sdss quasars .",
    "our selection algorithm uses both morphological and color selection .",
    "the former aims to select quasars that are extended and are not well fitted by a psf ; it is designed to identify small - separation ( @xmath9 ) lens candidates .",
    "the latter algorithm simply compares colors of close pairs of objects with those of source quasars , and is focused on lenses whose image separations are large enough to be deblended in the sdss imaging data reduction pipeline .",
    "our selection algorithm relies only on the outputs of the sdss imaging pipeline and therefore does not require independent analysis of the imaging data themselves .",
    "this allows easy and fast identification of lensed quasar candidates .",
    "we apply our algorithm to realistically simulated sdss images to quantify the completeness in detail . for the simulation of lenses ,",
    "we follow the methodology developed by p03 .",
    "we adopt observed distributions of sky levels and seeing sizes , as well as the observed sdss source quasar population in a real sdss quasar catalog , to estimate the completeness of our algorithm in a realistic manner .",
    "the algorithm will be applied to the sdss data in paper ii ( n. inada et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : source ] , we discuss the source quasar sample suitable for lens statistics .",
    "our lens selection algorithms are presented in  [ sec : sel ] , and are tested against simulations in  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "section [ sec : second ] is devoted to study an additional selection that is intended to remove any point - source like candidates .",
    "the efficiency of our algorithms is briefly discussed in ",
    "[ sec : eff ] , and we summarize our results in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "the sdss is a survey to image @xmath10 @xmath11 of the sky , and also to conduct spectroscopy of galaxies , quasars , and stars that are selected from the imaging data @xcite .",

    "this `` fiber collision '' limitation makes it unlikely to obtain spectra of more than one component in a gravitational lens . ] a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope @xcite at apache point observatory ( apo ) is equipped with a multi - ccd camera @xcite with five optical broad bands centered at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the imaging data are automatically reduced by the photometric pipeline photo @xcite .",
    "the astrometric positions are accurate to about @xmath17 for sources brighter than @xmath18 @xcite , and the photometric calibration errors are typically less than 0.03 magnitude @xcite .",
    "all data are being released on a regular schedule @xcite .",
    "we construct a statistical sample of lensed quasars from the spectroscopic sdss quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "the quasar sample is quite heterogeneous in the sense that the quasars are selected with several different methods and the completeness is strongly dependent on the properties of quasars ( e.g. , magnitudes , redshifts , morphologies ; see * ? ? ?",
    "we make a subsample of source quasars , which are suitable for lens statistics , by posing the following restrictions .    1",
    ".   we consider only quasars in the redshift range @xmath19 .",
    "lower - redshift quasars are often extended in the sdss images , which makes the morphological selection (  [ sec : sel_mor ] ) quite difficult ; in any case , these quasars have low lensing probabilities . at low redshift",
    "most quasars are targeted by uv excess which can select both point and extended quasars efficiently , while at higher redshifts outliers from the @xmath20 stellar locus are targeted as quasar candidates , for which we had to restrict our attention to point sources because of large contamination from galaxies .",
    "this is clearly shown in figure [ fig : compl ] , which plots the completeness obtained from the simulation by @xcite .",
    "the completenesses are different at @xmath21 between point and extended quasars , which introduces a non - negligible anti - lens bias .",
    "in particular , extended quasars at @xmath22 are not selected by the quasar target selection algorithm , which significantly reduces the number of @xmath9 separation high - redshift lenses in the sdss spectroscopic quasar catalog ( see also appendix [ sec : append ] ) .",
    "in addition , at @xmath23 it becomes more difficult to use colors to distinguish quasars from stars , thus the efficiency of lens candidate selections is significantly degraded , particularly at the large - separation region where contamination from stars are quite large .",
    "we adopt quasars with galactic extinction corrected @xcite @xmath24-band magnitudes @xmath25 .",
    "this is because at @xmath26 the low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) quasar target selection is almost complete @xcite , while fainter quasars are selected mainly with various `` serendipity '' algorithms @xcite which are very incomplete and may introduce biases in estimating lensing rates .",
    "moreover , the faint quasars have several disadvantages , including large photometric errors that reduce the efficiency of lens selection algorithms , and contamination by lens galaxies that become more important for less luminous quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "fainter lenses are identified as lens candidates with lower efficiency because of their lower signal - to - noise ratios ( see  [ sec : compl ] ) .",
    "close lens pairs are difficult to distinguish from single psfs if the seeing is poor",
    ". therefore we reject quasars in fields if the @xmath24-band image has the sdss imaging parameter psf_width ( effective psf width based on 2-gaussian fit ) @xmath27 .",
    "this criterion rejects roughly @xmath28 of quasars .    as a specific example",
    ", we adopt the 46,420 quasars in the dr3 quasar sample @xcite as our parent sample . by restricting the range of @xmath24-band magnitudes and redshifts ,",
    "the number of quasars decreases to 23,316 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the final number of quasars , after rejecting poor seeing fields , is 22,682 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in this section , we present our two selection algorithms , using morphological and color selection criteria , respectively .",
    "the algorithms are intended to identify low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) lensed quasars , though their extension to higher - redshift lenses is rather straightforward ( besides the inefficiency and imcompleteness of high - redshift lenses ) .",
    "lens candidates are identified using imaging data ; we do not use any spectroscopic information , although in some cases spectra offer a powerful way to locate gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we determine the selection criteria described below mostly in an empirical manner ; we choose criteria to keep the completeness high , for both known lenses and simulations done in  [ sec : sim ] , and at the same time have reasonable efficiency when applied to the sdss data .",
    "when the image separation between multiple images is small ( @xmath31 ) , photo can not deblend the system into two components , and the objects are classified as single extended objects .",
    "thus small - separation lenses can be identified as lens candidates by searching for objects that are poorly fitted with the local psf .",
    "to do so , we use the following two sdss imaging parameters .",
    "one is objc_type which describes the classification of the object as stars or galaxies , determined from the differences of magnitudes obtained by fitting psf and galaxy profiles to the images in each band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; objc_type @xmath32 indicates the object is a point source , while objc_type @xmath33 means the object is extended .",
    "the other parameter , star_l ( available in each band ) , is the probability that an object would have at least the measured value of @xmath34 of a fit of the image to the psf , if it really is well represented by a psf .",
    "put another way , the higher the value of star_l , the more likely it is fitted by a psf .",
    "the specific selection criteria of this morphology selection are as follows .",
    "first , even if a quasar is classified as a point source , we select it as a lens candidate if the psf likelihood is small .",
    "specifically we select objects that satisfy all of the following four conditions : @xmath35 we do not use the @xmath36-band star_l parameter because of the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath36-band images .",
    "although the s / n of @xmath37-band images are also low , we use the @xmath37-band parameter because quasars are uv - excess sources and thus the @xmath37-band is quite effective in discriminating quasar - quasar pairs from quasar - star pairs .",
    "however , we find that the condition on the @xmath37-band parameter is sometimes too strong , resulting in missing some lens candidates . as a separate cut , we adopt a relaxed range of @xmath37-band star likelihood , but slightly tighter conditions on other parameters : @xmath38 when a quasar image is classified as extended , we use a similar but relaxed , criterion to identify a lens candidate ; an object is selected when all the following three conditions are met : @xmath39 we select quasars that satisfy one or more of the criteria ( m1)-(m3 ) as lens candidates . in practice ,",
    "approximately half of small - separation gravitational lenses are classified as extended objects and selected by the condition ( m3 ) .",
    "lenses that are classified as point - sources tend to satisfy both conditions ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) ; the difference between ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) becomes important only for limiting cases in which lenses are close to the magnitude limit ( @xmath40 ) and/or have very small image separations ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "these conditions are designed using both real sdss data and simulations presented in  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "when the image separation is large enough for photo to deblend two components , we can select lens candidates by comparing the colors between spectroscopically confirmed quasars and candidate companions . at @xmath42",
    "the candidates companions must be point sources , but for smaller separations we also allow extended sources to be candidate companions , because for such small separations lensing galaxies may be superposed on the fainter components ( e.g. , q 0957 + 561 ) . the selection method presented here",
    "is somewhat similar to those given by @xcite and @xcite , but we follow p03 to extend the methods to select differentially reddened lenses .",
    "we conduct the color selection on the basis of the color difference : @xmath43 where ( @xmath24 , @xmath44)@xmath45(@xmath37 , @xmath46 ) , ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , ( @xmath47 , @xmath24 ) , ( @xmath24 , @xmath36 ) , and quasar and companion indicate the sdss spectroscopic quasar in the source quasar sample and candidate companion , respectively .",
    "we use psf magnitudes and their errors throughout the paper .",
    "although the definition of @xmath48 contains a sign ambiguity , we regard candidate pairs as lens candidates if they pass the criteria below using either one of the above definitions : this becomes important when we consider differential reddening , because at first sight we do not know which object is reddened more .",
    "when the color difference comes from reddening , @xmath48 for all set of ( @xmath24 , @xmath44 ) must have the same sign . on the other hand ,",
    "the color difference of two unrelated objects could have both positive and negative signs for different ( @xmath24 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "this is the reason we do not define @xmath48 as the absolute value of the color difference .",
    "since gravitational lensing does not change the color of objects , the color difference should be small if two components are lensed images of a single quasar .",
    "this criterion can be written as follows : @xmath49 which must be met for all four colors .",
    "the limit @xmath50 describes an acceptable error of the color difference , which we adopt the following fixed values @xmath51 these values correspond to typical 3-@xmath52 errors of the color differences of faint ( @xmath53 mag ) objects in the sdss images .",
    "we find that color differences contain very large errors when image separations are small because of the sdss deblending algorithm . to account for this , we replace @xmath50 with @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and with @xmath56 for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is defined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 are psf magnitude errors estimated by photo . since it is quite rare that objects lie at so close to the quasar , the large errors have little effect on the efficiency of our lens selection algorithm .",
    "while gravitational lensing is independent of wavelength , significant color differences between lensed components may be caused by reddening .",
    "for instance , @xcite measured the distribution of differential reddening @xmath61 from a number of gravitationally lensed quasar systems and found that is well described by a gaussian with a zero mean and standard deviation of @xmath62 mag .",
    "we estimate how the differential reddening affects the color difference @xmath48 as follows ( see also p03 ) .",
    "first , we use the composite quasar spectrum of @xcite as an input quasar spectral energy distribution .",
    "next we adopt the galactic extinction law ) is indeed small .",
    "] of @xcite and compute the color difference as a function of quasar and lens redshifts and @xmath61 , assuming @xmath63 .",
    "we show estimated reddening vectors for several sets of quasar and lens redshifts in figure [ fig : red ] . as expected , the effect of the differential reddening is more significant for bluer bands . from this estimation , we prepare another color selection algorithm in color - color space that is designed to select lens systems with large differential reddening : @xmath64 where the condition must be satisfied for all set of ( @xmath65 , @xmath66)@xmath45(@xmath67 , @xmath68 ) , ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , and @xmath71 the color difference errors , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , were defined in equation ( [ eq : colordif_er ] ) and the text that follows it .",
    "figure [ fig : red ] shows the color selection regions defined by ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) . in particular , figure [ fig : red ] indicates that the condition ( c2 ) can identify lens systems with very large differential reddening , @xmath74 .",
    "the cut at @xmath75 is added to reduce the contamination of quasar - star pairs .",
    "we select quasars that satisfy one or both the criteria ( c1 ) or ( c2 ) as lens candidates .",
    "to quantify the completeness of our selection algorithm , we perform a series of simulations that mimic sdss observations .",
    "we follow the methodology developed by p03 , but in this paper we implement multicolor ( @xmath76 ) simulations to test our selection based both on the morphology and color match .",
    "first , we prepare object fields in which simulated lensed images are placed .",
    "we assign the characteristics of each field ( sky level , seeing , and magnitude zero - point ) from a randomly selected field in the real sdss data .",
    "figure [ fig : field ] shows the sky counts and seeing sizes ( psf_width ) of 1000 random fields . following the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : source ] , we reject fields with psf_width @xmath27 in @xmath24-band in our simulations .    for each field , we also choose a quasar randomly from the subset of the dr3 quasar catalog with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and adopt its redshift and magnitudes in the simulation .",
    "however , the redshift and magnitude distributions of the lensed population are quite different from those of the original unlensed population , because the lensing probability is a strong function of redshift and magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we account for this difference by assigning to each object a weight proportional to its lensing probability , computed from a singular isothermal sphere model for the mass distribution of lensing galaxies and the velocity function of early - type galaxies derived from the sdss @xcite .",
    "the velocity function in comoving units is assumed to be constant with redshift .",
    "the magnification bias is computed by assuming the luminosity function of quasars obtained from the combination of the two - degree field and sdss results ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  2slaq+croom et al .",
    " model ) .",
    "although the lensing probability is sensitive to cosmological parameters , their main effect is to change the overall amplitude of the lensing probability and to have little effect on the dependence of lensing probability on the source redshift and magnitude , on which we are focusing .",
    "figure [ fig : qso ] plots redshifts versus @xmath24-band magnitudes for randomly selected quasars with and without lensing probability weighting .",
    "because of magnification bias , gravitational lensing preferentially chooses brighter and higher - redshift quasars .    we convert magnitude to the number of counts with the following equations",

    "gravitationally lensed images are created in the simulated image by placing two point - source objects that are separated by an angle @xmath85 and have a flux ratio @xmath86 .",
    "for the point - spread function ( psf ) , we use an analytic psf composed of two moffat functions with @xmath87 and @xmath88 and widths given for each field ( @xcite ; p03 ) .",
    "we take this difference into account throughout the paper . ]",
    "the psf magnitude of each system is normalized to that of the input quasar psf magnitude in each band . with this procedure",
    ", we can simulate lensed quasars with realistic colors and field conditions .",
    "we also include differential reddening in our simulation .",
    "the value of differential extinction @xmath61 is randomly distributed as a gaussian with a standard deviation of @xmath62 mag @xcite .",
    "again , the reddening vectors are computed from the composite quasar spectrum of @xcite and the extinction curve of @xcite assuming @xmath63 .",
    "the lens redshifts are also assigned randomly in the range @xmath89 $ ] with @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the redshift of the source quasar .",
    "the distribution has the average redshift @xmath92 , which is consistent with the value @xmath93 , the mean of 30 existing gravitationally lensed quasar systems with known lens redshifts .",
    "we note the flux ratio @xmath86 depends on the band when reddening is included ; hereafter we refer to @xmath86 as the flux ratio of the @xmath24-band image .",
    "we next pass these simulated fields through the photo pipeline . here",
    "we briefly summarize the procedure ; for more details , see p03 .",
    "we begin by preparing a psf frame in which bright psf stars ( constructed from two moffat functions ) are displayed .",
    "this psf field is passed through the fake stamp pipeline and postage stamp pipeline to generate a psfield file in which the result of the psf fit is stored .",
    "the object field is passed through the fake stamp pipeline and frames pipeline ; this produces tables of the measured object parameters ( fpobjc ) as well as the cropped atlas images ( fpatlas ) . we do not need to pass the result through the photometric calibration pipeline , since we can convert counts to magnitudes again by using equations ( [ eq : mag1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mag2 ] ) .",
    "the magnitude error is estimated from that of the counts as @xmath94}}\\frac{1}{2b}\\frac{10^{0.4(z+kx ) } } { \\sqrt{1+\\left[(f / f_0)/2b\\right]^2}}. \\label{eq : mag3}\\ ] ] the image parameters used to select the lens candidates are extracted from the fpobjc file . when photo deblends two images , we regard the brighter image as targeted by the quasar spectroscopic target selection , and use the image parameters of the brighter image .",
    "we repeat the simulation for different sets of field parameters , redshifts and magnitudes of quasars , and reddening , and compute the completeness of our selection algorithm as a function of the image separation @xmath85 and flux ratio @xmath86 .",
    "each simulation run consists of simulations of @xmath95 quasars ; the separation is changed from @xmath96 to @xmath97 with a step of @xmath98 and the flux ratio from @xmath99 to @xmath100 with a step of a factor of @xmath101 .",
    "since the maximum image separation @xmath102 is large enough compare with the seeing sizes of the sdss images , we think the completenesses of larger - separation lenses can be approximated by those of @xmath102 .",

    ", the distribution of star likelihoods for single quasars peaks at star_l @xmath107 and rapidly decreases as star_l decreases .",
    "this figure assures that the conditions ( m1 ) and ( m2 ) presented in  [ sec : sel_mor ] serve as an excellent method to distinguish gravitational lenses from normal quasars .",

    "in particular , our selection algorithm is @xmath108 complete at @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( indicated by dotted lines ) .",

    "however , when the image separation is too small to be distinguished from a point source , the psf magnitude is that of the sum of the two images .",

    "we consider our selection algorithm s effectiveness for such quadruple lenses .",
    "the difficulty in studying the selection of quadruple lenses lies in their complexity ; while double lenses are parameterized by flux ratio and image separation , we require 8 parameters to characterize a quadruple lens , making a full exploration almost impossible . instead ,",
    "in this paper we adopt the image configurations and flux ratios from 20 known quadruple lenses taken from the castles webpage ( see table [ table : quad ] ) .",
    "we apply a similarity transformation to the quadruple lenses in order to derive the completeness as a function of the image separation .",
    "we define the image separation to be the maximum distance between multiple images .",
    "the differential reddening is included , again using the distribution of @xcite . as in the case of double lenses , we simulate 1000 runs to make an accurate estimate of the completeness .    figure [ fig : quad ] plots the completeness of each of the 20 quadruple lens configurations as a function of the image separation , as well as the average of them .",
    "we find that our algorithm can select quadruple lenses reasonably well : even in the limiting case , @xmath155 , the completeness is @xmath156 on average , and at @xmath157 it is almost unity .",
    "we note that in both cases the completenesses vary most rapidly at @xmath158 where the number of lensed quasars peaks .",
    "there is a systematic difference of the completeness between double and quadruple lenses : at @xmath159 the completeness for double lenses is larger than that for quadruple lenses , while at @xmath157 the quadruple lenses are more complete .",
    "the differences are small , but they might become important when discussing the relative number of quadruple and double lenses @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : quad_dec ] shows the completeness for morphological and color selections separately . unlike double lenses , quadruple lenses are effectively chosen by the morphological selection even at large image separations , @xmath160 .",
    "in addition , it is quite common that lenses are selected by both criteria this is because quadruple lenses are more complex than double lenses . in particular , the complexity and larger number of images for quadruple lenses make the completeness at @xmath157 quite large .",
    "again , the completeness from the two selection algorithms as well as total completeness are listed in table [ table : comp_quad ] .",
    "we also study the completeness for different image configuration types : fold ( two of the images lie close together ) , cross ( almost symmetric ) , and cusp ( three of the images lie close together ) .",
    "to do so , we divide the 20 quadruple lenses into these three categories by visual inspection , and compute the average completeness for each category .",
    "the categorization is summarized in table [ table : quad ] , and the results are shown in figure [ fig : quad_type ] .",
    "our algorithm selects cross lenses very well , but is less effective for cusp lenses ; this is because the fourth image of a cusp lens , which lies far from the critical curve , is usually much fainter than the other images near the critical curve and therefore the effective `` flux ratio '' of cusp lenses becomes small . to pursue this further",

    "the nonzero completeness at @xmath164 implies that our morphological selection algorithm falsely identifies `` normal '' quasars as lenses . indeed ,",
    "when we apply our algorithm to dr3 quasar catalog , we find many lens candidates , many of which appear to be point sources ( see  [ sec : eff ] ) , although most normal single quasars are removed by our morphological selection .",
    "therefore , in this section , we present an additional selection which is aimed to exclude such point sources .    to do so , we fit systems selected by our morphological selection algorithm with two psfs using the galfit package @xcite , and derive the image separation and flux ratio .",

    "the point sources should have significantly smaller image separation and/or larger flux ratios than the above limit .",
    "therefore we can reject such point sources by making a cut in image separation - flux ratio space .",
    "we do this fit on both the @xmath37- and @xmath24-band images : we use the @xmath24-band image because the flux ratio is defined by that of the @xmath24-band image .",

    "it is seen that quadruple lenses show smaller image separations on average than double lenses ; this is clearly because galfit tends to fit the two brightest images that are not necessarily the two separated farthest from each other . from this result , we determine the selection criterion to be the following : @xmath167 where @xmath85 and @xmath168 are the separation and magnitude difference between fitted two psf components .",
    "we select candidates that meet all of the above criteria . in our simulation",

    "[ sec : sim ] .",
    "the condition ( s1 ) rejects @xmath169 of candidates selected by the morphological selection ( see  [ sec : eff ] ) .",

    "it is expected that the efficiency is a strong function of the image separation , thus we consider the three image separation ranges , @xmath159 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 , and derive the efficiency for each image separation range separately .",

    "for the smallest image separation bin , the efficiency is comparable to that of the class , which discovered 13 gravitational lenses out of 149 candidates @xcite .",
    "we note that the candidates can be restricted further by comparing with other existing observations ( see paper ii ) such as faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm @xcite , which should increase the efficiency .",
    "we have presented the sqls lens candidate selection algorithm from the sdss spectroscopic quasar catalog .",
    "our algorithm consists of two selection methods , a morphological selection that identifies `` extended '' quasars , and a color selection that picks up adjacent objects with similar colors .",
    "both selection methods rely only on imaging parameters that the sdss reduction pipeline generates , thereby allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates . to reduce the number of candidates further",
    ", we fit the images of morphologically selected candidates with two psfs , deriving the image separations and magnitude differences , and applying cuts in the image separation - magnitude difference space .",

    "distributions of field parameters ( i.e. , seeings and sky levels ) as well as those of source quasars are taken from the real sdss data .",
    "we have also taken differential reddening by lens galaxies into account .",
    "the simulated sdss images are then passed through the imaging data processing pipeline used in the sdss .",

    "we have also quantified the magnification factor of lensed images as a function of the image separation , which is important for accurate computation of magnification bias .",
    "the algorithm successfully identifies both double and quadruple lenses , although there is a systematic difference of completenesses between double and quadruple lenses .",
    "the efficiency depends strongly on the image separation ; at separations less than @xmath4 the preliminary efficiency of our selection algorithm is about 8% , comparable to that of the class .",
    "an important effect we have neglected in our simulation is fluxes from lens galaxies .",
    "although for quasars with @xmath184 and redshifts above @xmath185 lens galaxies tend to be fainter than lensed quasars , they could affect quantitative results .",
    "an important point is that lensed quasars are not selected by the quasar spectroscopic target selection if the fluxes of lens galaxies dominate : a good example is the high - redshift lens sdss j0903 + 5028 @xcite that was targeted for sdss spectroscopy as a luminous red galaxy , rather than a quasar , because the lensing galaxy is brighter than the lensed quasar images .",
    "therefore such systems will not be included in sdss spectroscopic quasar catalogs .",
    "this means that we need to simulate quasar spectroscopic target selection for lensed systems , as well as lens selection algorithms , to address the effect of lens galaxy fluxes .",
