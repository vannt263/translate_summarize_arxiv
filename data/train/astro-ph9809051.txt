    "the discovery of intense gamma - ray emission from blazars had a strong impact on our understanding of relativistic jets .",
    "independent evidence of relativistic beaming was provided by the condition that the source should be transparent to high energy gamma - rays ( mattox et al .",
    "1993 , von montigny et al .",
    "1995 , dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray fluxes and spectra , together with data at lower frequency allowed detailed estimates of the physical parameters of different models ( maraschi , ghisellini and celotti 1992 ; blandford 1993 ; sikora , begelman and rees 1994 ; dermer and schlickeiser 1993 ) .",
    "more recently the discovery of tev emission from some objects ( mrk 421 , mrk 501 and 1es 2344 + 514 ) and the detection of very fast variability at these high energies motivated new theoretical and observational studies ( e.g. celotti , fabian and rees 1998 )    the objects detected at tev energies have similar spectral energy distributions ( sed ) from radio to x - rays .",
    "they emit synchrotron radiation with power peaking in the x - ray band . for mrk 421 and mrk 501",
    "the x - ray and tev radiation vary in a correlated fashion ( macomb et al .",
    "1995 , buckley et al .",
    "1996 , catanese et al .",
    "1997 , schubnell 1997 ) suggesting that the tev emission derives from the same high energy electrons responsible for the synchrotron x - rays . for mrk 421",
    "the tev flux has been observed to vary with a 20 min timescale ( gaidos et al .",
    "1996 ) , which strongly limits the size of the emitting region .",
    "furthermore a lag has been measured between soft and medium energy x - ray photons .",
    "a lag of the same order between soft and medium x - ray photons has been measured also in pks 2155 - 304 , whose spectral energy distribution closely resembles that of mrk 421 up to the x - ray range , but has not yet been observed at tev energies due to its southern declination .",
    "the lags strongly suggest a radiative origin yielding a new important constraint on the physical parameters of the emitting region . for mrk 501 ,",
    "similar in spectral shape to the previous two , an extraordinary flaring behaviour has been observed recently ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the simplest model proposed for tev blazars involves a single zone and a single population of relativistic electrons emitting synchrotron radiation from radio to x - rays and inverse compton radiation from x - rays to gamma - rays . for this class of sources",
    "the seed photons for the inverse compton process are likely to be the synchrotron photons themselves ( ssc ) ( see e.g. ghisellini & maraschi 1996 , mastichiadis & kirk 1997 ) , although other models have also been considered ( for a review see sikora 1997 ) .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the ssc model in the following .",
    "our scope is to provide general analytic expressions for all the constraints that can be envisaged within this simple model and discuss the consequent restrictions in the parameter space for the above mentioned sources individually and as a group .",
    "a similar approach was initiated by ghisellini , maraschi and dondi ( 1996 ) ( hereafter gmd ) , however it did not include all the conditions and was limited to regimes well below the klein nishina limit , while for tev blazars the klein nishina corrections are important .",
    "work along these lines has been developed by dermer , sturner and schlickeiser ( 1997 ) and by bednarek and protheroe ( 1997 ) .",
    "the latter authors chose to use precise formulas requiring however numerical computations , with loss of generality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the constraints that can be put on the homogeneous ssc model using all the available observations . in section 3 the relevant formulae",
    "are derived which link model parameters to observative quantities .",
    "the effects of the klein nishina limit are discussed in detail and revised analytic formulae are given valid also in the latter regime . in section 4",
    "we apply our diagnostics to the case of three well known blazars and finally ( section 5 ) we discuss the results .",
    "the homogeneous ssc model assumes that radiation is produced in a single zone of the jet ( approximated here for simplicity as a sphere with radius @xmath5 ) , relativistically moving at small angle @xmath6 to the observer s line of sight .",
    "photons up to the x - ray range are produced by relativistic electrons through the synchrotron process and are subsequently inverse compton scattered by the same electrons to energies in the @xmath7-ray range .",
    "the observed radiation will be strongly affected by relativistic effects .",
    "the key parameter is the doppler factor @xmath8^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath9 is the bulk lorentz factor and @xmath10 .",
    "the observed sed of tev emitting blazars ( in a @xmath11 plot ) is characterized by two broad peaks , the first approximately in the x - ray band , the second in the 100 gev-1 tev band . below and above the peaks",
    "the spectrum is quite smooth and can be approximated with power - law profiles with indices @xmath12 respectively where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see e.g. gmd ) .",
    "note that within the present uncertainties the `` left '' side of both peaks can be described by the same spectral index .",
    "note also that the spectrum in the tev range is poorly known and may be affected by intergalactic absorption ( see e.g. stecker and de jager 1997 and reference therein ) . in figure ( [ prima ] ) we show the observed sed of mrk 421 at two different epochs ( macomb et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the observed spectral shape requires that the the relativistic electron spectrum steepens with increasing energy .",
    "we approximate this behaviour with a broken power law ( gmd ) with indices @xmath15 , respectively below and above the `` break''energy @xmath16 : @xmath17 with these approximations we can completely specify the model using 7 parameters : the magnetic field intensity @xmath18 , @xmath5 , @xmath19 , the slopes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the lorentz factor of the electrons at the `` break '' , @xmath22 , and the electron density parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the peak synchrotron power is emitted by electrons with the break energy @xmath24 .",
    "the maximum energy @xmath25 attained by electrons as well as a possible lower limit @xmath26 are unimportant here provided that @xmath27 and @xmath28    spectra computed with the above assumptions are compared with the mkn 421 data in fig .",
    "the theoretical curves show that the double power - law approximation can reproduce reasonably well the shape of the observed sed .",
    "the available data on the sed can be used to derive 6 `` observable '' quantities of particular relevance for the above model , namely the indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the frequency of the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the peak luminosities @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these quantities are rather uncertain being ideally the result of a fitting procedure on simultaneous multifrequency data , but in practice often inferred from observations obtained at different epochs and with incomplete frequency coverage .",
    "the best sampled spectral region is usually the optical to x - ray range , therefore @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath35 are better determined than @xmath36 and @xmath34 .",
    "1 can serve as an illustration of the uncertainties in the determination of the `` observables '' for mrk 421 , perhaps the object with the best overall data .",
    "we recall that the one - zone homogeneous model is selfabsorbed at radio frequencies and can not explain the radio emission which implies further contributions from the outer regions of the jet .",
    "it is important that , at least in principle , one can derive from the broad band spectral observations 6 quantities that have to be reproduced with the 7 parameter model .",
    "one more observable quantity is sufficient to close the system .",
    "this can be provided by the minimum timescale of variation , @xmath37 , which can be directly connected to the source dimension , @xmath5 , through the causality relation @xmath38 .",
    "this relation gives only an upper limit on the dimension of the source , but a small dimension implies a high doppler factor if the transparency condition is taken into account ( see below ) . in order not to force @xmath39 to be too large we will adopt limits to the radius of the emission region in the range @xmath40- @xmath41 . at this point",
    "the system is closed and any additional constraint that can be satisfied should be regarded as supporting the model .",
    "these are :    * the transparency of the source to @xmath7-rays .",
    "+ the high energy photons may interact with the low energy ones producing pairs .",
    "the fact that we observe the tev emission poses a strong limit to the optical depth of the source to photon photon interaction and therefore to the energy density of the soft radiation . from this limit",
    "one can obtain a lower limit on the value of the doppler factor ( see e.g. dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) . *",
    "the radiative interpretation of the time lags in the light curves at different frequencies .",
    "+ recently , observations of mrk 421 and pks 2155 - 304 with asca ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) have revealed that when pronounced flares occur , the soft photons lag the harder ones ( takahashi et al .",
    "1996 , urry et al .",
    "the simplest way to explain the time lags in a homogeneous model is through the hypothesis that they are associated to the time necessary for freshly injected high energy electrons to cool . with this assumption the measured time lags determine the cooling time setting a well defined condition on the model .",
    "* the consistency of the break energy of the electrons with the condition of balance between cooling and escape .",
    "+ in our discussion the electron energy distribution is not calculated self - consistently ( for an example of this alternative approach see e.g. inoue and takahara 1996 , mastichiadis and kirk 1997 , ghisellini et al .",
    "the two spectral indices and the break energy are determined from the observed spectra . having determined at the same time the dimension of the emission region and the magnetic and radiative energy densities we can verify a posteriori whether the cooling time of the electrons at the break is of the order of the escape ( expansion ) time from the emission region .",
    "we will assume that consistency is achieved if the required escape / expansion velocity is in the range @xmath42 .",
    "we recall however that in the standard hypothesis of a power law injection and subsequent cooling and escape in a homogeneous region , a spectral change @xmath43 is expected , while in general for the sources discussed below the observed steepening is larger , suggesting a more complex situation .",
    "+ we approximate the cooling time as the minimum between the synchrotron and the compton cooling times . in the @xmath18@xmath19 parameter space",
    "the regions of validity of these two approximations are separated by the line expressing equipartition between the magnetic and radiation energy density . in each of these regions",
    "a value of the cooling time defines only one line .",
    "bednarek & protheroe ( 1997 ) discuss a similar constraint on the cooling time of the electrons , but they incorrectly apply the condition to both the synchrotron and the compton cooling times _ simultaneously _ obtaining two independent constraints .",
    "summarizing , the ssc homogeneous model needs 7 independent parameters : the spectral observations give 6 independent quantities , and the seventh observational information used to close the system is the minimum variability timescale .",
    "other constraints are provided by the optical depth for @xmath7-@xmath7 interaction , by the observed time lags between soft and hard x - ray photons and by the consistency of the value of @xmath22 .",
    "these last conditions are additional independent constraints : if verified , these constraints argue for the physical consistency of a homogeneous ssc model . +",
    "in this section we derive the fundamental relations between the model parameters and the observable quantities discussed above . we chose to do this analytically at the cost of some inevitable approximation in order to maintain generality .",
    "most of these formulae are also discussed in gmd and dermer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that the two spectral indices can be determined directly from the data , independently of other quantities .",
    "the structure of the relations is then such that we can eliminate 3 of the remaining 5 parameters ( i.e. @xmath44 , k and r ) and express the constraints as allowed regions in the b-@xmath39 parameter space .      in the scheme that we consider the dominant synchrotron power",
    "is emitted by electrons at the break ( those with lorentz factor @xmath22 ) .",
    "primed quantities refer to the blob frame so that the observed frequency is given by @xmath45 .",
    "the photons at @xmath31 dominate the energy density of the target photons and the inverse compton power in the thomson limit will be dominated by photons at frequency @xmath46 , produced in the scattering between the electrons at the break and the photons with frequency @xmath47 ( see also gmd ) . inverting the last equation",
    "one obtains :    @xmath48    therefore the ratio between the peak frequencies gives directly the value of @xmath22 .",

    "we will see in the next section that in the kn limit this situation is reversed .",
    "another relation can be obtained from the ratio of the total luminosity of the synchrotron peak and the total luminosity of the self - compton peak , which is directly related to the ratio between the radiation and the magnetic field energy densities inside the source ( in the comoving frame ) :",
    "@xmath51    for our aims it is useful to express the total luminosity through the peak luminosity , which is more accessible to observations .",

    "thus the intersection of eq .",
    "( [ dodici ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ cinque ] ) allows to estimate @xmath18 and @xmath39 .",
    "the adopted spectral shape for the electrons ensures that the synchrotron spectrum has a well defined peak ( break ) ( as observed ) .",
    "thus both , electrons and photons , have a low energy branch and a high energy branch ( below and above the break ) . with the adopted approximations one can compute the inverse compton spectrum as the sum of 4 separate integrals : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , representing the contributions from electrons of the low ( 1 ) and high ( 2 ) energy branches scattering photons of the low and high energy branches respectively .",
    "full expressions are given in the appendix .",
    "this subdivision is very useful in the discussion of the klein nishina limit .",
    "the different contributions , computed using the well known @xmath19-function approximation for the single electron emission and a step function for the energy dependence of the cross section , @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 otherwise ( see coppi and blandford 1990 for a critical discussion ) , are shown in fig .",
    "all the spectra are computed in the source frame for fixed values of @xmath70 hz and varying @xmath22 from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , that is for increasing importance of the kn limit .",
    "since the assumed particle spectra have no high energy cut offs , at high enough energy , the kn limit is always relevant and steepens the spectrum .",
    "the limiting frequency can be estimated considering that the largest contribution to the radiation energy density is due to photons of frequency @xmath73 .",

    "this is seen in fig .",
    "2a and 2b , where three ( 12 , 21 , 22 ) of the four components in the total spectrum cut off at high energies , while the peak of the inverse compton spectrum occurs as expected in the thomson limit",
    ".    however the effect will be severe and affect both the value of the peak frequency and the bulk of the emitted power if @xmath75 is close to @xmath76 , that is if the kn regime sets in already for the scattering of electrons of energy @xmath22 with photons at the peak of the synchrotron emission .",
    "therefore the condition for the kn regime to affect severely the luminosity and the peak frequency of the inverse compton emission , requiring a revision of the formulae given in section 3 is :    @xmath77    using eq .",

    "2d @xmath79 is negligible and the low energy side is dominated by by the @xmath80 branch .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the assumed spectral shape the scattering of highest energy electrons with very low energy photons gives a significant power law contribution to the inverse compton spectrum at the highest energies .",
    "the latter component is not important energetically ( at the peak ) however it provides a high energy tail which extends the range of the inverse compton emission .",
    "the spectral index of the latter contribution can be easily derived from the expression for @xmath81 given in the appendix and is @xmath82 .",
    "this component could explain the power law spectra measured in the tev range for mrk 421 and mrk 501 ( zweerink et al . 1997 ) .      in the kn regime both the expression of the compton peak frequency and luminosity must be modified . as shown in fig .",

    "the transparency condition ( [ diciotto ] ) calculated for photons with @xmath146 hz yields a lower limit @xmath147 represented by the vertical line . the kn condition [ eq . ( [ limite ] ) ]",
    "yields an upper limit @xmath148 , while the more stringent version [ eq . ( [ limitedue ] ) ] yields @xmath149 .",
    "for @xmath150 we are therefore in an intermediate region where both limits are inaccurate .",
    "we chose to use the thompson limit here since the resulting value of @xmath19 will be 25 , close to the upper end .",
    "we recall however that even if the thomson limit is adequate for the peak of the compton component , kn effects can not be neglected in the computation of spectra at higher energies ( see fig . 1 , fig . 2a ) .    the observed ratio between the two peak frequencies [ eq . ( [ cinque ] ) ] imposes an inverse proportionality relation between b and @xmath19 .",
    "this is shown as a shaded area allowing for a factor 3 uncertainty in the actual value of the compton peak frequency .",
    "the ratio of the peak luminosities ( [ dodici ] ) yields a steeper relation between b and @xmath39 , @xmath151 .",
    "again it is represented by a shaded area to allow for uncertainties in the observational input data .",
    "the intersection between the two regions above defines the allowed region , where the actual values of the parameters should fall .",
    "this region could shrink if the observational data improve , but given the present gap between the energy ranges of egret and the ground based cherenkov telescopes it is unlikely that it could be substantially reduced .",
    "the time lag constraint has a shallow dependence on @xmath19 ( @xmath152 ) and is well defined observationally .",
    "therefore it is represented as single thick line ( labelled _ l _ ) in fig .",
    "it is extremely interesting that this line , which is completely independent of the spectral constraints , is consistent with the parameter region allowed by those constraints .",
    "it is also interesting that the region defined by the condition that the break energy of the electrons is determined by a balance between cooling and escape eq .",
    "( [ sedici ] ) ( region c ) encompasses the lag constraint in the relevant parameter interval .",
    "we conclude that for mrk 421 the spectral constraints are consistent both with the radiative interpretation of the soft photon lag and with the break energy as due to cooling .",
    "these are persuasive arguments in support of the simple general model .",
    "the estimated parameter values are @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( see table 2 )    note that the value of @xmath19 is rather high compared to other estimates ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) but similar to that found from direct model fits by mastichiadis & kirk ( 1997 ) and ghisellini & maraschi ( 1996 ) .",

    "no simultaneous x - ray and gamma - ray observations are available yet .",
    "it has not been detected in the tev band .",
    "this may however be due to its southern declination , since in the southern hemisphere cherenkov telescopes have started observations only recently .",
    "the parameters of the synchrotron component are inferred from the spectrum measured during the 1994 multifrequency campaign ( @xmath155 hz and @xmath156 erg s@xmath139 , urry et al .",
    "comparison with previous observations ( see sambruna et al .",
    "1994 ) shows that during these observations pks 2155 - 304 was in an intermediate state , a factor 2 less luminous than the brightest state recorded by exosat .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum measured with egret is hard , implying that the compton peak is beyond the egret range .",
    "however the absence of tev observations does not allow to determine the position of the peak .",
    "we will therefore use the other constraints to estimate the peak frequency of the compton emission and the associated tev luminosity , assuming that all of them should be satisfied as is the case for mkn 421 .    in fig .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) we show the parameter obtained for @xmath157 hz and for an `` observed '' luminosity of @xmath158 erg s@xmath139 extrapolated from the gev range .",
    "we assume a minumum variability time of @xmath159 s and a delay of @xmath160s between the variations observed in the 0.75 kev and 6 kev energy bands ( urry et al .",
    "the vertical line representing the transparency condition is plotted for photons with frequency @xmath161 hz for consistency with the following estimates of the tev flux .",
    "note , however , that the lower limit on the doppler factor given by the transparency condition would be weaker in the absence of tev emission .    in this case ,",
    "the largest uncertainty is on the position of the compton peak , while the frequency of the synchrotron peak is reasonably well known .",
    "we therefore plot the uncertainty band for fixed @xmath31 and for @xmath32 ranging from @xmath162 hz to @xmath163 hz . for these values of the peak frequencies",
    "the kn limit yields @xmath164 , smaller than the transparency limit : we can make use of the thomson formulation .",
    "we find that all the constraints are satisfied for values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 very similar to those found in mrk 421 ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) ; the cooling - escape consistency for @xmath22 is satisfied also in this case .",
    "we can estimate the value of the tev flux of pks 2155 - 304 with the hypothesis that beyond the break the spectral indices of mrk 421 and pks 2155 - 304 are similar . from the spectrum of mrk 421",
    "we can obtain the value @xmath165 ; from the inferred value of the @xmath7 peak flux of pks 2155 - 304 we can evaluate the tev flux as : @xmath166 that gives an integrated flux @xmath167 ph s@xmath139",
    "@xmath168 , about @xmath169 that of mrk 421 in the in the non - flaring state . hence we expect that a detection of pks 2155 - 304 should be possible but requires sufficient sensitivity , due to the low flux .",
    "tev observations of pks 2155 - 304 would be extremely important also because they may reveal or constrain absorption of high energy photons by the intergalactic ir background ( stecker and de jager 1997 ) , better than in the case of mrk 421 because of the larger distance .",
    "the bl lac object mrk 501 ( z=0.034 ) underwent a dramatic tev and x - ray outburst in april 1997 ( see e.g. pian et al .",
    "1998 , catanese et al . 1997 ) .",
    "previous observations showed a spectral distribution very similar to mrk 421 , with a synchrotron peak in the soft x - ray region ; in contrast , during the april observation the peak was found at about 100 kev , a shift in energy of at least a factor 100 .",
    "the broad band spectral shape leads to interpret the hard x - ray emission as synchrotron radiation and the flare as due to injection of electrons with very high energy ( pian et al . 1998 ) .    in fig .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) we show the parameter space for mrk 501 in the quiescent state . in this state",
    "we can apply the relation for the thomson case , given that the value of @xmath170 required by the transparency condition is higher than @xmath171 .",
    "we have used the following values for the observable quantities : @xmath155 hz , @xmath172 hz , @xmath173 erg / s , @xmath174 erg / s , @xmath175 h , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . + for the quiescent state we have large uncertainties on the position of the compton peak : the boundaries of region a refer to values of @xmath176 hz ( upper line ) to @xmath177 hz .",
    "since a measurement of a time lag between variations in different frequencies is lacking the associated constraint can not be used .",
    "the longer variability timescales and the lower luminosity with respect to the two previous sources allow in this case a value of @xmath19 around 10 , lower than those inferred in mrk 421 and pks 2155 - 304 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , while the value found for the magnetic field intensity , @xmath178 is similar .",
    "for the high state we must use the formulation in the kn limit : in fact the thomson condition ( [ limite ] ) yields a value of @xmath179 , highly implausible . for the observables we have used the following values : @xmath180 , @xmath181 erg / s , @xmath182 erg / s and the variability time and the spectral indices as in the quiescent state .",
    "the compton peak frequency is not well determined since the spectra measured in the tev range suffer from various uncertainties ( samuelson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however all the measurements give slopes steeper than 1 indicating that the peak is at lower energies .",
    "we therefore consider values between @xmath183 hz .    in the kn regime the parameter region allowed by the peak frequency ratio ( region a ) has @xmath18 increasing with @xmath19 [ see fig .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) ] .",
    "the luminosity ratio ( region b ) has almost no intersection with region a for values of @xmath19 allowed by the transparency condition .",
    "on the other hand the emitting region could be smaller than imposed by the variability time scale by a factor larger than 3 . in that case region",
    "b would extend upwards defining a permitted region at @xmath184 , @xmath185    however , the condition of consistency for the value of @xmath186 , given in the kn limit by eq .",
    "( [ sedicikn ] ) ( region c ) , is definitely outside the parameter region allowed by the other constraints , implying that the shape of the electron spectrum can not be determined balancing radiation losses and escape , unless again the size of the region is much smaller than estimated from the observed variability .",
    "since the flaring state lasts much longer than the cooling time , efficient continuous reacceleration processes are needed .",
    "a comparison of the parameter space for the low and high states of mkn 501 indicates that not only @xmath22 but also @xmath18 increased in the flaring state .",
    "we have extended the analytic treatment of the spectral constraints on the ssc homogeneous model for blazars initiated by gmd including kn corrections and adding the discussion of other constraints now available .",
    "the constraints can be summarized in the magnetic field - doppler factor plane . in principle",
    "the knowledge of @xmath187 plus @xmath37 allows the determination of b , @xmath39 , @xmath44 , r and k. the transparency condition , the time lag condition , the cooling - escape balance are further restrictions that overconstrain the model .    in practice",
    "large uncertainties on the observational quantities still exist , but at least for the best observed tev blazar , mrk 421 , we can significantly constrain the parameter space .",
    "we find that the radiative interpretation of the lags is consistent with the spectral constraints .",
    "moreover , the break in the distribution is consistent with the equilibrium between the energy losses and electron escape timescale .",
    "the derived value of the the doppler factor is moderately large ( @xmath154 ) , in agreement with the values found by specific spectral fits ( see e.g. ghisellini & maraschi 1996 ; mastichiadis & kirk 1997 ) .",
    "we have applied the analysis also to pks 2155 - 304 , a well observed object in the low energy bands , detected in two occasions with egret in @xmath7-rays . assuming consistency between all the constraints ( as found in the case of mrk 421 ) we estimate that the peak of the compton component should fall at about @xmath188 hz : for higher values we do not find consistency between the spectral constraints and the time lags as measured in the 1994 observational campaign ( urry et al .",
    "we estimate the tev flux , which could be measured by southern cherenkov telescopes .    the last object analized is mrk 501 , a tev emitter that has shown a dramatic flare in april 1997 . for the quiescent state we can apply the classical formulation , while for the flaring state we must use the formulae in the kn limit .",
    "the absence of information about time lags prevents to completely constrain the model : however we can estimate that the value of the doppler factor is about 10 , smaller than in the other two sources .",
    "the high state is consistent with a costant doppler factor , but impllies an increase in @xmath44 and in the magnetic field .",
    "the required value of @xmath44 is inconsistent with cooling - escape equilibrium , indicating the need of an efficient continuous reacceleration mechanism .    in conclusion",
    "the analytic approach offers a solid basis for a general discussion of the model and its applicability to specific sources .",
    "it allows to derive parameter ranges taking into account uncertainties in the `` observable '' quantities and a better comprehension of the interrelations between various parameters .",
    "we stress however that table 2 has been derived applying a number of restrictive choices and hypothesis for illustrative purposes and should not be taken at face value .",
    "individual fits remain essential to better understand the detailed shape of the particle spectra and their origin .",
    "_ note : _ after the paper was accepted we learned about the detection of pks 2155 - 304 by the durham mark 6 cerenkov telescope ( chadwick et al . 1998 ) with a flux of @xmath189 ph @xmath168 s@xmath139 , consistent with our estimate .",
