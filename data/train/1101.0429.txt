    "the additional energy of a glass @xmath45 in a glass , however , is due to the presence of excitations relative to the ideal glass .",

    "( [ heat_entropy",

    "one of the important observations of such systems is the existence of a residual entropy @xmath5 , such as the entropy at the point g in fig .",
    "[ fig_gap_model ] .",
    "it is the entropy a glass or a crystal would have at absolute zero , and is related to the possible number of disjoint components in the phase space @xcite .",
    "it is merely a measure of the number of lowest energy microstates of energy @xmath46 for a given _ mode of preparation _ at absolute zero .",
    "the macrostate of the glass or the crystal is a collection of all these microstates along with their probability of occurrence for a given mode ; see @xcite .",
    "the mode of preparation determines the energies of these microstates , which need not be the lowest possible energy ( such as @xmath44 for the supercooled liquid if we are concerned with a glass ) for the system @xcite .",
    "the lowest possible energy microstates represent the equilibrium macrostate at absolute zero .",
    "it should be emphasized that there is no reason for the lowest energy macrostate to be non - degenerate in principle , although it seems to be true for a majority of the systems .",
    "therefore , we will assume in this work that @xmath48 for the supercooled liquid at k. this is borne out of several exact calculations as discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the system ( glass or crystal ) can be in any of lowest energy microstates ( and not the lowest _",
    "possible _ enrgy microstates ) for a given mode of preparation , and the residual entropy is determined by all these microstates @xcite .",
    "the existence of a non - zero residual entropy ( @xmath49 ) is very common in nature , and does not violate nernst s postulate , as the latter is applicable only to equilibrium states with a non - degenerate ground state ( * ? ? ?",
    "its existence was first demonstrated by pauling and tolman @xcite ; see also tolman @xcite .",
    "in addition , the existence of the residual entropy has been demonstrated rigorously for a very general spin model by chow and wu @xcite . for ice ,",
    "the residual entropy was observed by giauque and ashley @xcite .",
    "pauling @xcite provided the first numerical estimate for the residual entropy for ice , which was later improved by nagle @xcite .",
    "nagle s numerical estimate has been recently verified by simulation @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation carried out by bowles and speedy @xcite for glassy dimers also supports the existence of a residual entropy .",
    "thus , it appears that the support in favor of the residual entropy is quite strong .",
    "we wish to emphasize that what is customarily called the third law due to nernst , according to which the entropy must vanish at absolute zero , is merely a postulate and not a strict theorem even in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "indeed , many exactly solved statistical mechanical models show a non - zero entropy at absolute zero .",
    "based on these empirical observations , the residual entropy @xmath5 at g in fig .",
    "[ fig_gap_model ] has been taken as non - zero and positive .",
    "we refer to fig .",
    "[ fig_gap_model ] to emphasize this point once more .",
    "as @xmath43 decreases , g moves not only to the left but also down in the figure .",
    "this has the consequence of lowering @xmath50 and @xmath5 , so that entropy continues to decrease with temperature to ensure stability of the glass .",
    "the additional energy or enthalpy due to excitation compared to the ideal glass raises the residual entropy of the glass relative to the ideal glass:@xmath51    however , it is possible that the residual entropy @xmath5 at g remains zero for all @xmath43 as if all glasses are identical at absolute zero for any @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , the situation shown in fig . [ fig_gap_model ] has been challenged @xcite , because it is argued that the entropy can not be estimated correctly in the glass transition region , the region where component confinement occurs , where _ irreversibility _ comes into play .",
    "this is certainly true , as can be easily seen form eqs ( [ entropy_heatcapacity ] ) and ( [ general_entropy_calculation ] ) . while the idea that the irreversibility raises some concern about the inferred values of the entropy is certainly justified , the main point is not whether irreversibility is present ; see sect .",
    "[ marker_irreversibility_residual_entropy ] .",
    "rather , the question should be : how much of an error does this create in the inferred values of the entropy ?",
    "thus , the issue at hand is the magnitude of @xmath40 .",
    "various estimates support an error that does not exceed more than 5% .",
    "jckle @xcite has also calculated the amount of uncertainty in the entropy for glycerol due to irreversibility near the glass transition , and found it to be less than 5% .",
    "gutzow and schmelzer @xcite have shown by citing some earlier analysis that the irreversible contribution to the entropy in the vicinity of the glass transition is small enough to be practically neglected . they also provide a very enlightening historical review of the residual entropy in glasses .",
    "nemilov @xcite comes to a similar conclusion by suggesting that the error in @xmath5 is no more than 5% .",
    "the conclusion is that there is no appreciable error in using conventional equilibrium thermodynamics by replacing the inequality to an equality in eqs .",
    "( [ entropy_heatcapacity_bounds]-[entropy_heatcapacity ] ) in studying glasses , a point also made recently by goldstein @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can get a highly reliable estimate of the entropy of a glass ( gl ) or the supercooled liquid ( scl ) without using any internal order parameter by the following standard integration process using the measured heat capacity@xmath52 more recently , johari and khouri @xcite have come to a similar conclusion by reanalyzing experimental data .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that as a consequence of the component confinnment , the system is no longer able to explore _ in time _ the entire part of the phase space that would be consistent with the observables ( such as the energy ) of the system . with this interpretation in mind , and recognizing the fact that the entropy is measured by the volume of the accessible phase space , such as that belonging to a component , it is then argued that the entropy @xmath4 of the system must undergo a sudden or rapid _ reduction _ in its value due to component confinement @xcite that is expected to occur at the glass transition , but the experiments are unable to capture this because of the irreversibility .",
    "we will call this entropy reduction scenario the _ unconventional view _ ( uv ) of the glass transition in this work . in this scenario , either fg in fig .",
    "[ fig_gap_model ] remains disconnected from ba0 to account for a sudden discontinuous reduction or touches ba0 at some point c but falls off rapidly from c to give rise to a rapid but continuous drop . in the latter scenario ,",
    "the portion of fg to the immediate left of c will have to change its curvature so that it will be no longer concave , a point of critical importance that will be discussed at several occasions in this work .",
    "it is impossible to continuously join two disjoint concave functions without creating a loss of concavity .",
    "if it happens that the entropy @xmath8 of the medium concurrently undergoes a sudden or rapid _ rise _ by an amount such that it not only compensates the reduction in @xmath4 , but add some more so that @xmath6 does not decrease , then the rapid reduction in @xmath4 would not violate the second law for the isolated system as given in eq .",
    "( [ second_law ] ) .",
    "however , in this case also , the irreversible entropy change in the system must still satisfy the second law : @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , our third aim is to investigate if such a scenario can be supported by the second law .",
    "our last goal is to use the second law to investigate the idea of the residual entropy from a statistical point of view and to prove that the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig_gap_model ] with a non - zero residual entropy is borne out of experiments .",
    "this will be in contradiction with the idea of an entropy reduction in the unconventional view .",
    "the enthalpy @xmath54 and the volume @xmath55 are known to be continuous during the glass transition @xcite .",
    "thus , any entropy reduction will leave its imprint on the behavior of the gibbs free energy .",
    "thus , we will also investigate the behavior of the gibbs free energy in this work .",
    "the other relevant issue , which to the best of our knowledge has not been discussed in the literature so far for unexplained reasons , is whether the experimental data support a non - zero residual entropy even if the irreversibility may be quite appreciable , as would happen in a rapid quench . from above , it is clear that the experimental determination of the residual entropy @xmath56 invariably yields a non - zero value .",
    "we derive later a very simple consequence of the glassy irreversibility in the form of an inequality ; see eq .",
    "( [ general_entropy_calculation ] ) .",
    "the inequality clearly supports a non - zero residual entropy , even if the irreversible contribution is appreciable ; see eq .",
    "( [ residual_entropy_bound ] ) .",
    "it just happens that in most cases , the irreversible contribution turns out to be minimal .",
    "however , the reality of the residual entropy is based not on the minimal irreversible contribution ; it is rather based on the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ general_entropy_calculation ] ) .",
    "thus , the _ entropy reduction _ due to _ confinement _ in the unconventional view can not be attributed simply to the presence of irreversibility .",
    "its root - cuse , if it exists , has to be found elsewhere .",
    "our aim in this work is to follow the recently developed non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite to specifically derive non - equilibrium thermodynamic principles , which should reduce to the well - known thermodynamic principles for equilibrium bodies @xcite .",
    "we must ensure that these principles do not violate the second law in anyway .",
    "we start by assuming the existence and continuity of @xmath6 , and follow i and ii . the existence assumption should not be surprising as the existence of @xmath6 is required to state the second law for an isolated system @xmath0 ; see eq .",

    "the latter requires the entropy to increase during relaxation as shown by the relaxation arrow for @xmath62 in fig .",

    "accordingly , every realization of the balls or spins will remain in its microstate forever , just like a glassy system which remains confined to a disjoint component @xcite due to kinetic freezing .",

    "we have no information as to which component a sample is frozen into .",

    "we can not just consider one particular sample , since the entropy is not the property of a single component .",
    "is it possible to justify that the entropy is determined by considering just one of the components in which the system is confined ?",
    "if such a determination is possible , it must be because the entropy discontinuously decreases when the component confinement occurs .",
    "the reduction in entropy is most certainly possible if we perform a measurement to identify the microstate in which a given sample is .",
    "to identify a particular microstate requires complete information about the body , which is ordinarily unfeasible . in order to identify any particular microstate",

    "@xcite , that provides us with the complete information about the body in its current microstate @xmath298 . for the ising model ,",
    "this requires _ determining _ the orientations of each of the @xmath89 spins . after the microstate measurement , we know with certainty which microstate the system is in . before the measurement , a given sample is known to be in one of the microstates .",
    "the probability @xmath299 that the sample is in microstate @xmath298 is @xmath300  this probability changes _ discontinuously _ from @xmath301 to @xmath302 immediately after the measurement . the effect of the microstate measurement is to also reduce the probabilities of all other microstates @xmath303 to @xmath304 for this sample .",

    "no such measurement is ever made that identifies precisely which component the glass is frozen in .",

    "2 .   because of the lack of such a measurement",
    ", we must determine the entropy by averaging over all components as shown in eq .",
    "( [ s_components ] ) by considering all possible samples with the probability distribution @xmath307 for the components .      in real glass formation",
    ", no probability collapse occurs as no microstate measurement is ever performed to identify the particular component the sample is in .",
    "the sample still has the same probability to be in any of the @xmath223 components it had before the confinement occurs .",
    "the confinement does not alter the probability distribution .",
    "all we know for sure is that a glass sample is in any one of the @xmath223 components .",
    "we do not know the actual component it is in .",
    "this situation is identical to the die which is known to be in one of the six possibilities when it is concealed by the cup , or to the non - interacting ising spins discussed earlier .",

    "even if the outcome can not change when we lift the cup , the outcome is most certainly not certain when concealed by the cup ; see @xcite for more details on this point .",
    "the information that the glass has been formed is most certainly not equivalent to knowing precisely the particular component in which the glass is trapped .",
    "the latter will require the collapse of the original probability distribution by a microstate measurement .",
    "the entropy is obtained by taking the average over all the samples , and not only one glass sample , in accordance with the fundamental axiom .",
    "let us now follow this line of reasoning .",

    "the above way of writing is an identity and applies under all cases .",
