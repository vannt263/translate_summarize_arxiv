    "the production of hadrons is due to the strong interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the gauge theory of the strong interactions , provides a quantitative description of the transitions from quarks and gluons to jets of hadrons , which may be tested experimentally .",
    "when jets are produced at colliders , they can be initiated either by a quark or a gluon .",
    "the two types of jets are expected to exhibit different properties , above all because quarks and gluons carry different color charges and spin .",
    "in fact , a gluon jet is typically broader and contains a larger amount of hadrons .",
    "jets with different mother partons can also be studied by looking for the jet charge distribution as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with important consequences for the physics at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . to understand",
    "the interplay of quarks and gluons in a jet and to predict testable consequences thereof lies at the very core of qcd .    the typical way to depict the production of a jet from a parton ( quark or gluon ) is the following .",
    "an initial parton starts radiating gluons , which in turn can radiate further gluons or split into secondary quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "this so - called parton showering process causes the virtualities of the parent partons to decrease . finally , when the virtuality falls below a certain cutoff , the cascade stops and the final - state partons hadronize into color - neutral hadrons , a process usually described by phenomenological models .",
    "this happens because the production of hadrons is a typical process where nonperturbative phenomena are involved .",
    "however , for particular observables , this problem can be avoided . in particular , the _ counting _ of hadrons in a jet that is initiated at a certain scale @xmath5 belongs to this class of observables . in this case",
    ", one can adopt with quite high accuracy the hypothesis of local parton - hadron duality ( lphd ) , which simply states that parton distributions are renormalized in the hadronization process without changing their shapes @xcite .",
    "hence , if the scale @xmath5 is large enough , this would in principle allow perturbative qcd to be predictive without the need to consider phenomenological models of hadronization .",
    "nevertheless , such processes are dominated by soft - gluon emissions , and it is a well - known fact that , in such kinematic regions of phase space , fixed - order perturbation theory fails , rendering the usage of resummation techniques indispensable .",
    "as we shall see , the computation of avarage jet multiplicities indeed requires small-@xmath0 resummation , as was already realized a long time ago @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the singularities for @xmath6 , which are encoded in large logarithms of the kind @xmath7 , spoil perturbation theory , and also render integral observables in @xmath0 ill - defined , disappear after resummation .",
    "usually , resummation includes the singularities from all orders according to a certain logarithmic accuracy , for which it _ restores _ perturbation theory .",
    "small-@xmath0 resummation has recently been carried out for timelike splitting fuctions in the @xmath8 factorization scheme , which is generally preferable to other schemes , yielding fully analytic expressions . in a first step",
    ", the next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) level of accuracy has been reached @xcite . in a second step , this has been pushed to the next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) , and partially even to the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( n@xmath9ll ) , level @xcite .",
    "thanks to these results , we are able to analytically compute the nnll contributions to the evolutions of the average gluon and quark jet multiplicities with normalization factors evaluated to next - to - leading ( nlo ) and approximately to next - to - next - to - next - to - order ( n@xmath9lo ) in the @xmath10 expansion .",
    "the previous literature contains a nll result on the small-@xmath0 resummation of timelike splitting fuctions obtained in a massive - gluon scheme .",

    "@xcite , where a differential equation for the average gluon - to - quark jet multiplicity ratio was obtained in the mlla within the framework of the colour - dipole model , and the constant of integration , which is supposed to encode nonperturbative contributions , was fitted to experimental data .",

    "<S> we develop a new formalism for computing and including both the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd contributions to the scale evolution of average gluon and quark jet multiplicities . </S>",
    "<S> the new method is motivated by recent progress in timelike small-@xmath0 resummation obtained in the @xmath1 factorization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) resummed expressions , which represent generalizations of previous analytic results . </S>",
    "<S> our expressions depend on two nonperturbative parameters with clear and simple physical interpretations </S>",
    "<S> . a global fit of these two quantities to all available experimental data sets that are compatible with regard to the jet algorithms demonstrates by its goodness how our results solve a longstandig problem of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the statistical and theoretical uncertainties both do not exceed 5% for scales above 10  gev . </S>",
    "<S> we finally propose to use the jet multiplicity data as a new way to extract the strong - coupling constant . including all the available theoretical input within our approach , we obtain @xmath2 in the @xmath1 scheme in an approximation equivalent to next - to - next - to - leading order enhanced by the resummations of @xmath3 terms through the nnll level and of @xmath4 terms by the renormalization group , in excellent agreement with the present world average .    </S>",
