    "galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) are crucial stellar systems to constrain the input physics adopted to construct evolutionary and pulsation models  @xcite , to investigate the kinematic properties of gas - poor , compact systems  @xcite and to constrain the formation and evolution of the galactic spheroid ( halo , thick disk , bulge ; e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the ggcs often host rr lyrae variables ( rrls ) , which are fundamental distance indicators for low - mass , old stellar populations .",
    "they are bright enough to have been detected in several local group galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "they can also be easily identified , since they have characteristic light curves and periods . the most popular methods to estimate their distances are the visual magnitude ",
    "metallicity relation and the near - infrared ( nir ) period - luminosity ( pl ) relation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the reader interested in other independent approaches based on rrl to estimate stellar distances is referred to the thorough investigations by , e.g. ,  @xcite .    the visual magnitude ",
    "metallicity approach appears to be hampered by several theoretical and empirical uncertainties affecting both the zero - point and the slope  @xcite .",
    "the nir pl relation seems very promising , since it shows several indisputable advantages .",
    "dating back to the seminal investigation by  @xcite it has been demonstrated on empirical basis that rrl do obey to a well defined @xmath1-band pl relation .",
    "the key reason why the pl relation shows up in the nir bands is mainly due to the fact that the bolometric correction in the nir bands , in contrast with optical bands , steadily decreases when moving from hotter to cooler rrls .",
    "this means that they become brighter as they get cooler .",
    "the pulsation periods at fixed stellar mass and luminosity become longer , since cooler rrls have larger radii .",
    "the consequence is a stronger correlation between period and magnitude when moving from the @xmath15- to the @xmath1-band .    the advantages of using nir pl relations to estimate distances are manifold .",
    "i ) _ evolutionary and pulsation predictions indicate that the nir pl relations are minimally affected by evolutionary effects inside the rrl instability strip .",
    "the same outcome applies for the typical spread in mass inside the rrl instability strip  @xcite .",
    "this means that individual rrl distances based on the nir pl relations are minimally affected by systematics introduced by their intrinsic parameters and evolutionary status . _",
    "ii ) _ theory and observations indicate that fundamental ( f or rr@xmath6 ) and first overtone ( fo or rr@xmath8 ) rrl do obey independent nir pl relations that are linear over the entire period range covered by f and fo pulsators .",
    "the nir pl relations together with the aforementioned features have also three positive observational advantages .",
    "+ _ a ) _ the nir magnitudes are minimally affected by reddening uncertainties .",
    "this means that the rr lyrae nir pl relations can provide robust distance estimates for systems affected by differential reddening . _",
    "b ) _ the luminosity amplitude in the nir bands is at least a factor of 2 - 3 smaller than in the optical bands .",
    "therefore , accurate estimates of the mean nir magnitudes can be obtained with a modest number of observations . moreover",
    ", empirical light curve templates  @xcite can be adopted to improve the accuracy of the mean magnitude even when only a single observation is available . _",
    "c ) _ thanks to the unprecedented effort by the 2mass project  @xcite , accurate samples of local nir standard stars are available across the sky .",
    "this means that both relative and absolute nir photometric calibrations do not require supplementary telescope time .",
    "the use of the nir pl relations is also affected by four drawbacks .",
    "+ _  _ empirical estimates of the slope of nir pl relations show a significant scatter from cluster to cluster .",
    "they range from @xmath16 ( ic@xmath17  sollima et al .",
    "@xcite ) to @xmath18 ( m@xmath19 ,  sollima et al .",
    "@xcite ) and it is not clear yet whether this change is either intrinsic or caused by possible observational biases . _  _ both theoretical and empirical investigations of the plk show a not - negligible scatter of the zero point .",
    "this is a crucial point , as we plan to adopt the plk as a tool to derive distances . indeed , if we set as a reference @xmath20 and @xmath21=-1.5 $ ] , the most robust absolute magnitude estimates range from @xmath22 ( infrared flux method , @xcite ) to @xmath23 ( hb models , @xcite ; empirical calibration @xcite ) , with intermediate values of @xmath24 ( pulsational models @xcite ; hb models,@xcite ) .",
    "+ _  _ evolutionary and pulsation predictions indicate that the intrinsic spread of the nir pl relations decreases as soon as either the metallicity or the hb - type of the horizontal branch ( hb ) is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "this means that accurate distance estimates of field rrls do require an estimate of the metallicity .",
    "moreover , no general consensus has been reached yet concerning the value of the coefficient of the metallicity term in the nir period - luminosity - metallicity ( plz ) relations .",
    "the current estimates for the @xmath1-band range from @xmath25  @xcite to @xmath26  @xcite mag / dex based on cluster and field rrls , respectively .",
    "+ _  _ the use of the template light curves does require for each object accurate estimates of b / v - band amplitudes and of the epoch of maximum .    to address these problems",
    "our group undertook a long - term project aimed at providing homogeneous and accurate nir photometry for several gcs hosting sizable samples of rrls and covering a wide range of metallicities .",

    "* hereinafter paper ii ) and @xmath27 centauri  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper iii ) .    in this paper",
    "we present new results for the ggc m5 ( ngc@xmath28 ) .",
    "this system is a typical _ halo _ globular cluster , and indeed , it is located at a distance of only @xmath29 from the sun , @xmath30 from the galactic center , and @xmath31 above the galactic disc  @xcite ; its space motion is @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has a low reddening ( @xmath33 , according to the harris catalog ,  @xcite , and its new revision  @xcite ) and metal - intermediate composition , with estimates ranging from @xmath34  @xcite to @xmath35  .",
    "this cluster is a very good target to investigate the nir plz relation , since it hosts a rich sample of rrls ( @xmath36 in the 2002 release of the clement s on - line catalog ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the rr@xmath6 stars have an average period of @xmath37 , making m5 as one of the classical oosterhoff type i clusters  @xcite .",
    "it is located only two degrees from the celestial equator , and therefore , the search for cluster variables has been performed using telescopes from both hemispheres . according to  @xcite",
    "a total of @xmath38 variables were present in m5 and among them @xmath39 were rrls .",
    "a significant fraction of these variables were discovered by  @xcite with the remaining stars identified by  @xcite .",
    "the central regions of m5 have been surveyed photographically by  @xcite and  @xcite who found an additional @xmath40 variables .",
    "subsequently ,  @xcite supplemented the catalog with five other variables , while  @xcite presented observations of @xmath41 rrls , three of which were new discoveries . @xcite",
    "added @xmath42 new variables located across the central regions of the cluster .",
    "more recent investigations by  @xcite and   identified @xmath43 previously unknown variables , while   and  @xcite identified @xmath44 new variables .",
    "we end up with a sample of @xmath45 variable stars , and among them @xmath46 are f and @xmath47 fo rrls .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_obs ] we discuss the observations and the strategy adopted to perform the photometry and to calibrate the data .",
    "the rrl properties and the approach adopted to determine their light curves are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec_rrl ] , while in sec .",
    "[ sec_pl ] we present the plk and the plj relations . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec_con ] , we summarize the current findings and briefly outline future perspectives .",
    "we collected @xmath0 and @xmath48 images in six different runs from february 2001 to march 2002 with sofi@ntt / eso and @xmath0 and @xmath49 data in two runs in may 2005 and july 2005 with nics@tng .",
    "the sofi data were collected in the large field mode with a pixel scale of @xmath50 arcsec / pixels and with a field of view of @xmath51 .",
    "nics was also used in the large field mode , with pixel scale of @xmath52 arcsec / pixels and with a field of view of @xmath53 . for both instruments ,",
    "observations were obtained of off - target fields for the sky subtraction . since the cluster is moderately extended ( tidal radius @xmath54 arcmin ,  @xcite ) , for both instruments two different pointings",
    "were observed , mapping the cluster in the north - south direction ( sofi ) and in the east - west direction ( nics ) , covering two strips of about @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath55 @xmath57 in both directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_map ] ) .",
    "we collected @xmath46 ( @xmath58 s of total exposure ) @xmath0- and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 s ) @xmath48-bands useful frames with sofi , and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 s ) @xmath0- and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 s ) @xmath49-bands images with nics .",
    "the number of epochs for recovered rrls ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "the log of observations is given in table  [ tab_log ] .",
    "the raw sofi frames were first corrected for the cross - talk effect with the iraf procedure ` crosstalk.cl ` , available in the sofi web pages .",
    "data were then pre - processed with our iraf - based custom pipeline , which corrects for bias , flat field and bad pixel mask , and subtracts the sky contribution with a two - step technique as described in  @xcite .",
    "the nics images were corrected for cross - talk with a ` fortran ` program made available in the nics web pages , and thereafter pre - processed with the same pipeline described above , without applying any bad pixel mask .        [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "on the basis of our data , we found that the weighted mean of the different theoretical and empirical calibrations of the plk relation gives a true distance modulus of @xmath10 mag .",
    "the distance to m5 based on the plk relation also agrees quite well with similar estimates available in the literature , but based on different distance indicators .",
    "the distance estimates listed in table  [ tab_dist_mod_all ] indicate quite clearly that the current distance agrees within @xmath67 with distance based not only on the plk relation  ( @xmath68 mag * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also on main - sequence fitting method @xcite and semi - geometric approach  ( @xmath69 mag * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , our distance is systematically longer than the distance to m5 provided by  @xcite using synthetic horizontal branch models and pulsation properties of rrls and the difference is larger than 1@xmath11 .    in this context",
    "it is noteworthy that the distance based on the plk relation agrees with the distance based on the proper motions @xmath70=@xmath12 mag by  @xcite .",
    "even though the intrinsic error of the quoted distance estimates differ by more than one order of magnitude , the two distances taken at face value agree quite well .",
    "if this agreement is not fortuitous , due to the large error bar in the  @xcite estimate , this would be first time that kinematic distances agree with other distance indicators . typically , the kinematic distances to gcs are 0.2 - 0.3 magnitudes smaller than distance moduli based either on the plk relation of rrls , or on main - sequence fitting , or on the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ,  bono et al .",
    "the reasons for such discrepancies are not clear yet , but the current agreement appears very promising to further constrain the occurrence of possible systematic errors .    on the other hand , the distance based on the fitting of the white dwarf cooling sequence @xmath70=@xmath13 mag provided by @xcite is approximately 0.2 mag larger than distances based on other methods .",
    "the difference with the distance based on the plk relation and on main - sequence fitting is on average slightly larger than 1@xmath11 .",
    "this is also an interesting occurrence , since distance moduli to gcs based on the fitting of the white - dwarf cooling sequence are typically 0.1 - 0.3 mag smaller than distances to gcs based either on the trgb , or on the plk relation or on the main sequence fitting  @xcite .    we have also investigated the plj relation of rrl stars in m5 , and from a sample of 35 rrab and 23 rrc ( fundamentalized ) variables we found an empirical slope of @xmath71 .",
    "the uncertainty in the slope of the plj relation is almost a factor of two larger than the uncertainty in the slope of the plk relation ( 0.14 vs 0.08 ) because the luminosity amplitude in the @xmath0-band is larger in the @xmath1-band , and also because we still lack accurate @xmath0-band light curve templates .",
    "therefore , the mean @xmath0-band magnitudes were estimated as a time average and only for rrls with good phase coverage .",
    "homogeneous sets of time series data both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are required to constrain on an empirical basis the intrinsic spread of plk and plj relations .",
    "finally , we mention that by adopting the calibration of the plj relation provided by  @xcite , we found a true distance modulus to m5 of @xmath14 mag .",
    "the distances based on the plj and on the plk relations agree quite well , but the intrinsic error of the former is a factor of two larger .    the distances to m5 based either on the plk or on the plj relation",
    "agree quite well with distances based on independent robust standard candles .",
    "this finding further supports the key role that accurate nir photometry of cluster variables ( rrl , type ii cepheids ) can play in the improvement of gc distance scale @xcite . moreover and even more importantly",
    ", the comparison with m5 distances based on different distance indicators strongly supports the evidence that m5 might be a fundamental laboratory to constrain on a quantitative basis the thorny systematic uncertainties that might affect the most popular primary distance indicators .",
    "it goes without saying that this sanity check would benefit by further improvements in the precision of the kinematic distances and/or in the geometrical distances based on possible eclipsing binary systems in m5 .    in a future paper",
    "we plan to compare optical and nir photometry of m5 with evolutionary predictions , in particular for advanced evolutionary phases .",
