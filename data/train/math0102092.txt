    "the correspondence was given in @xcite , but we sketch the notion briefly .    given an embedded surface in @xmath79-space , we chose a generic projection into @xmath80-space and label the double points of the projection above and below to indicate their relative distance from the @xmath80-space into which they are projected . the pre - image of the double point set on the surface is called the _",

    "the scheme for determining this coloring is as follows : along a double point arc , an upper sheet with color @xmath82 locally separates the lower sheet into two pieces ( by the broken surface convention ) .",
    "one component of the lower sheet is colored @xmath76 and the other sheet is colored @xmath216 as depicted on the left of fig .",
