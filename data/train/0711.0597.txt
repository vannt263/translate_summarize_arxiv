    "in this paper we develop a method to approximate steady - state solutions of the following one - dimensional thermistor problem : @xmath0 subject to boundary and initial conditions , @xmath1 @xmath2 and coupled with the electric potential equation : @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5    the motivation for studying this kind of problem is that - has important implications for a variety of technological processes . for example",
    ", it arises in the analytical study of phenomena associated with the occurrence of shear band in metal being deformed at high strain rates @xcite ; in the theory of gravitational equilibrium of polytropic stars @xcite ; in the investigation of the fully turbulent behavior of flows @xcite ; in modelling aggregation of cells via interaction with a chemical substance ( chemotaxis ) @xcite ; and specially in modelling electrical heating in a conductor @xcite . in this case , @xmath6 is the temperature of the conductor , @xmath7 is the electrical potential .",
    "functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the electrical and thermal conductivities ; @xmath10 is the heat transfer coefficient .",
    "the condition is a condition of robin - type . when @xmath11 it is called an adiabatic condition .",
    "equation consists in the heat equation with joule heating as a source ; describes conservation of current in the conductor .",
    "the thermistor problem has been extensively studied by several authors @xcite , where existence and uniqueness of solutions are given .",
    "theoretical analysis , consisting in existence of solutions with the required regularity and which ensure error estimates of optimal order of convergence , are done in @xcite . to construct a numerical approximation of the steady state solution we use a numerical method to approximate the solution of the parabolic problem .",
    "this approach has been used by @xcite in the one - dimensional thermistor problem .",
    "further , in these last works authors consider the thermal conductivity @xmath12 equal to @xmath13 and a particular electrical conductivity , then they obtain the exact solution @xmath14 of the conservation problem - and so system - of thermistor problem is reduced to the following single heat conduction problem : @xmath15 subject to the boundary conditions - . in this paper",
    ", we propose to solve both equations and at the same time by using a finite element method and a fully crank - nicolson approach .",
    "the formulation of the finite element method is standard and is based on a variational formulation of the continuous problem . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we give the variational formulation of problem - .",
    "an algorithm for solving the problem is then proposed in section  [ sec3 ] . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "numerical results are obtained for an appropriate test - problem .",
    "we divide the interval @xmath16 $ ] into @xmath17 equal finite elements @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a partition of @xmath20 and @xmath21 the step length .",
    "by @xmath22 we denote a basis of the usual pyramid functions : @xmath23,\\\\ - \\frac{1}{h}x+(1+j )   & \\mbox { on } [ x_{j } , x_{j+1}],\\\\   0 & otherwise .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] as indicated above , it is convenient to proceed in two steps with the derivation and analysis of the approximate solution of - . first , we write the problem in weak or variational form . we multiply the parabolic equation by @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 fixed ) , integrate over @xmath26 , and apply green s formula on the left - hand side , to obtain @xmath27 using the boundary condition we get @xmath28 we also have @xmath29 we now turn our attention to solve this system by discretization with respect to the time variable .",
    "we introduce a time step @xmath30 and time levels @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a nonnegative integer , and denote by @xmath33 the approximation of @xmath34 to be determined .",
    "we use the backward euler galerkin method , which is defined by replacing the time derivative in by a backward difference @xmath35 .",
    "so the approximations @xmath36 , @xmath37 admit unique representations @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are unknown real coefficients to be determined .",
    "then , after decoupling , we have that @xmath41",
    "for scheme , we have @xmath42 on the other hand , we have @xmath43 using boundary conditions and initial condition , it follows that @xmath44 then , we have the resulting system of equations :    for @xmath45 , @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 for @xmath49 , @xmath50 coming back to , the following may be stated in terms of the functions @xmath51 : find the coefficients @xmath39 in @xmath52 such that @xmath53 in matrix notation , this may be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 since the matrix @xmath58 and @xmath59 are gram matrices , in particular they are positive definite and invertible .",
    "thus , the above system of ordinary differential equations has obviously a unique solution .",
    "we solve the system for each time level .",
    "estimating each term of separately , we have : @xmath60 using the expression of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we obtain @xmath63 in the same way , we have @xmath64 on other hand , we similarly have @xmath65 @xmath66 it also holds : @xmath67 @xmath68 using together and , we get a system of @xmath69 linear algebraic equations @xmath70 using the boundary conditions , we find @xmath71 from the initial condition we get @xmath72 let @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 substituting in , we obtain the following system of equations :    for @xmath45 , @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath49 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82",
    "in this section we give an example of a model of the thermistor problem : @xmath83 @xmath84    the exact solution of the electrical potencial problem is @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "then , the diffusion equation can be reduced to the form @xmath87 using the proposed galerkin finite element approach , we get the following system of algebraic equations :    for @xmath45 , @xmath88 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 for @xmath49 , @xmath91 where @xmath92 we now show some results from numerical experiments performed using our method and the computer algebra system . according with physical situations , we choose values of @xmath10 and @xmath93 verifying @xmath94 .",
    "in particular , we fixed @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the calculation of the steady - state for the thermistor problem is an important issue regarding the applications of the model in the thermistor device .",
