    "the taylor expansion of @xmath99 implies that the magnetization is contracting towards @xmath13 .    in order to achieve the concentration of @xmath90",

    "this segment begins with a `` burn - in '' period of @xmath103 steps , which is in fact the only regime where we benefit from the censoring of the dynamics . by the end of this",

    "once the magnetization reaches order @xmath106 , we may analyze the effect of the exponential growth of its expected value ( dictated by the above mentioned properties of the hyperbolic tangent function ) .",

    "first , we we establish an upper bound on @xmath108 .",
    "second , we carefully bound the difference between the @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which allows us to switch these two when tracking down the slight changes in @xmath111 along time ( via the taylor expansion of @xmath99 in this regime ) .    altogether , we show that with probability arbitrarily close to @xmath107 , we have @xmath112 and yet @xmath113 .      given a starting position of @xmath105 , an analogous argument which tracks @xmath111 ( using the exponential growth given by the taylor expansion of the hyperbolic tangent around @xmath93 ) implies that with high probability , @xmath115 and yet @xmath116 . crucially , though the above argument is similar to the one used for the previous segment , resetting the starting position to @xmath105 ( by separating the treatment of the first two segments ) provides the required control over the variability of @xmath90 .      given a starting position of , say , @xmath117 , with high probability @xmath90",

    ", we construct a coupling of two instances of the censored glauber dynamics , which ensures a fast collision .",
    "there are three key points in accomplishing this coupling .",
    "a.   around the cutoff point , with probability arbitrarily close to 1 , the magnetization is concentrated around @xmath13 within distance @xmath122 .",
    "b.   starting from somewhere near @xmath13 , with high probability the magnetization chain will stay `` sufficiently close '' to @xmath13 for a reasonably long period of time : within this distance from @xmath13 , the magnetization demonstrates certain contraction properties , and we can use correlation inequalities ( such as the fkg inequality ) to control its higher moments . c.   in the above mentioned contracting region , @xmath126 behaves as a supermartingale with a non - negligible variance at each step .",
    "altogether , we can deduce that within @xmath127 steps beyond the cutoff point , the two censored magnetization chains will collide with probability close to 1 .",
    "combining the above coupling argument with the behavior of the stationary distribution of the censored magnetization ( which concentrates around @xmath13 ) , as well as the lower bounds we obtained for hitting @xmath13 from @xmath91 or @xmath92 , completes the proof of the magnetization cutoff .",
    "the cutoff point of the censored magnetization chain clearly gives a lower bound on the mixing - time of the entire dynamics .",
    "furthermore , note that in the special case where the dynamics starts from the all - plus configuration , by symmetry it has a cutoff precisely whenever the magnetization chain exhibits cutoff .",
    "it remains to generalize this result to an arbitrary starting configuration . to boost the mixing of the censored magnetization ( from an arbitrary starting position ) to the mixing of the full dynamics , we use a two coordinate chain analysis , following the approach of @xcite . in order to apply this method",
    ", one needs to establish a series of delicate conditions on the censored magnetization chain .",
    "first , we combine an expectation analysis with concentration arguments to show that after @xmath15 steps , with high probability the censored magnetization starting from @xmath92 will stay at some  good state \"  roughly , not too biased towards plus or minus . as a corollary ( since the all - plus initial position can be used to sandwich the remaining initial positions ) , this holds for any starting position @xmath128 .",
    "two additional conditions are required to complete the two coordinate chain analysis .",
    "first , we show that the censored magnetization almost surely stays around @xmath13 for a sufficiently long period beyond its cutoff point .",
    "second , we show that with high probability , the average value of a spin over the set of initially positive spins ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) also concentrates around @xmath13 for a reasonably long period .",
    "these properties imply that the magnetization restricted to the set of initially positive spins mixes at the cutoff point , and the same holds for the magnetization over the set of initially negative spins . by symmetry",
    ", these two statements imply the entire mixing of the dynamics .",
    "we first study the spectral gap of the censored magnetization chain , which provides an immediate upper bound on the spectral gap of the entire dynamics . to determine this gap",
    ", we analyze the conductance of the chain ( a birth - and - death chain ) following the approach of @xcite*section 6 , and establish the order of the bottleneck ratio , yielding an effective lower bound . to obtain a matching upper bound , we use the dirichlet representation for the spectral gap , combined with an appropriate bound on the _ fourth _ central moment of the censored magnetization in stationarity .    to infer the spectral gap of the full dynamics from that of the censored magnetization , additional arguments are needed to obtain a lower bound on the gap .",
    "we separate the eigenfunctions into two orthogonal spaces , one of which exactly corresponds to the censored magnetization chain .",
    "we then use the contraction properties of the dynamics to prove that on the other space , the corresponding eigenvalues are uniformly bounded from above .",
    "this implies the desired lower bound for the spectral gap .",
    "in our efforts to analyze the censored glauber dynamics , in many cases it is useful to study the original dynamics and relate it to the censored one . throughout the paper , we let @xmath130 , @xmath131 denote the original glauber dynamics and its corresponding magnetization chain , and let @xmath89 and @xmath90 denote the censored dynamics and its magnetization chain .",
