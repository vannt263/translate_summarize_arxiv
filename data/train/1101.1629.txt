    "near - ir broadband ( 1100  1400  nm ) luminescence in bismuth - doped glasses discovered in refs .",
    "@xcite is being studied intensively . by now",
    "the luminescence has been observed in many bismuth - doped glasses , such as alumosilicate ( e.g. @xcite ) , alumogermanate ( e.g. @xcite ) , alumoborate ( e.g. @xcite ) , alumophosphosilicate , alumophosphate , alumophosphoborate @xcite , chalcogenide @xcite and in several bismuth - doped crystals ( rbpb@xmath2cl@xmath3 @xcite , fau - type zeolites @xcite , bab@xmath2o@xmath4 @xcite ) .",
    "the bismuth - related ir luminescence is used successfully in laser amplification and generation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the present state of research and applications of near - ir luminescence in bismuth - doped glasses are examined in the recent reviews , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however there is no commonly accepted model of the ir luminescence center .",
    "several models are suggested , such as electronic transitions in @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite interstitial ions , in @xmath8 interstitial molecules @xcite , @xmath9 , @xmath1 and @xmath10 interstitial dimers @xcite , other bismuth clusters @xcite , complexes with tetrahedral coordination of the central bismuth ion @xcite .    in our opinion there is good evidence for negative bismuth dimers being the luminescence centres ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , up to now , there are no convincing explanation of changes in absorption and luminescence spectra with glass composition ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the context of the @xmath1 and @xmath10 dimers as centres of the ir luminescence",
    "it would appear reasonable that such changes are caused by stark shift and splitting together with certain rearrangement of dimer states in glass network electric field .",
    "the latter does obviously depend on glass composition .",
    "alternatively , there is an evidence that single bi atoms and ions do occur as well in the bismuth - doped glass host .",
    "we studied raman scattering of ar laser 457.9  nm - light in optical fibres with bismuth - doped alumosilicate glass core and observed a narrow intensive band in the low - frequency part of the raman spectra , near 110  @xmath11 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .  4 ,  a  band ) . our calculation @xcite of neutral single bismuth atom , @xmath0 , and negative single bismuth ion , @xmath12 , incorporated in alumosilicate host in the sixfold ring interstitial sites proved both @xmath0 and @xmath12 have three vibrational modes practically not mixed with any vibrations of the rings .",
    "the frequency of these vibrational modes are found to fall in the 75  105 and 85  130  @xmath11 ranges , for @xmath12 and @xmath0 , respectively ( see fig .  5 in ref .",
    "one mode corresponds to displacement of the interstitial bismuth atom along the rings axis and the other two correspond to transverse displacement of the atom .",
    "all three vibrational modes are raman active , scattering in the transverse vibrations being an order as intensive as in the longitudinal ones .",
    "hence the raman band near 110  @xmath11 in bismuth - doped alumosilicate glass may be indicative of single bismuth atoms , @xmath0 , or negative ions , @xmath12 in sixfold ring interstitial sites of the glass network .",
    "recently electronic transitions in the @xmath0 atom has been supposed to be responsible for the near - ir luminescence in bismuth - doped glasses @xcite .    the aim of this work were to verify the assumptions regarding both the network electric field and the interstitial bismuth atoms by immediate calculation of optical properties of interstitial bi atoms and ions in networks of silica- and germania - based glasses .",
    "in our previous works @xcite we used calculated data for free negatively charged @xmath9 dimers to explain absorption and luminescence spectra of bismuth - doped glass .",
    "experimental data available for free @xmath0 atom were used to the same purposes in ref .",
    ". however an influence of glass network ( interstitial electrostatic field , in essential ) must be taken into account to discuss optical spectra of interstitial dimers and atoms .",
    "we performed quantum - chemical calculation of interstitial electric field in network of glasses of several compositions ( silica , germania , alumosilicate , germanosilicate , phosphosilicate , phosphogermanate ) .",
    "cluster approach was used to model the atomic environment of interstitial sites .",
    "two coaxial sixfold rings each formed by , ( for germanosilicate glasses with low germania content ) , or tetrahedra or octahedra ( for germanosilicate glasses with high germania content ) were incorporated in proper numbers in the clusters .",
    "the distance between the ring centres was optimized during the calculations . to ensure aluminum atoms being fourfold coordinated ,",
    "extra electrons were placed in the aluminum - containing clusters , one electron per aluminum atom . in -containing clusters",
    "two extra electrons were added per sixfold coordinated germanium atom to make it be stable in this coordination . dangling bonds of the outer oxygen atoms in the clusters",
    "were saturated with hydrogen atoms .",
    "all calculations were carried out with quantum - chemical code @xcite by dft method using blyp functional which is known to provide nice agreement of calculated geometrical parameters with experimental data .",
    "we used the bases and effective core potentials developed in ref .",
    "one @xmath13-type polarization function with @xmath14  a.u . was added in the basis for each oxygen atom .",
    "standard basis was used for hydrogen atoms .",
    "quantum - chemical modelling of configuration and vibrational properties of @xmath9 , @xmath1 and @xmath10 dimers and of single @xmath0 atom and @xmath12 ion in alumosilicate network was performed in our previous works @xcite using the above - described cluster approach .",
    "calculated configuration for @xmath1 interstitial dimer was presented in figure  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite for alumosilicate glass . in the present work",
    "such calculations were repeated for silica , germania , germanosilicate , phosphosilicate , and phosphogermanate clusters .",
    "the equilibrium configurations of negatively charged dimers , both @xmath1 and @xmath10 , in the interstitial site formed by two sixfold rings are found to be quite similar in all these networks : the dimers are aligned along the common axis of the rings , the first bismuth atom being practically in the center of one ring and the second atom being between two rings .",
    "again , equilibrium position of @xmath0 atom and @xmath12 ion are found to be between two six - rings in all these networks . as a representative example ,",
    "calculated configuration of alumosilicate glass cluster with @xmath0 interstitial atom is shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "such configurations turns out to be highly stable for both dimers and atom or ion : bismuth atoms do not form bond with any atom of the rings and returned to the equilibrium positions even after dimer or single atom is displaced considerably from that position .",
    "vibrational properties of interstitial @xmath0 atom and @xmath1 dimer in all these networks are found to be quite similar to those calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for alumosilicate host ( see above ) .",
    "atom in the sixfold - rings interstitial site of alumosilicate glass ]    electric field strength was calculated in the point of the @xmath0 atom position ( or , what is the same , near the bismuth atom of the @xmath9 dimer which is situated between two sixfold rings ) and in several ( 8  10 ) points in its vicinity .",
    "the value averaged over all such points was used in further calculations of optical spectra .",
    "the mean electric field strengths in ring interstitial sites calculated for several glass compositions are given in table  [ tab : e - fields ] .",
    "as evident from these data , the interstitial electric field is found to be approximately the same in silica , germanate and germanosilicate ( with low germania content ) hosts but considerably higher both in glasses containing aluminate or phosphate component and in germanosilicate glasses with high germania content .",
    "this is attributable to charged ( and ) or strongly dipole - polarized ( ) structural units in the rings around interstitial bismuth sites in such glasses .",
    ".calculated electric field in sixfold ring interstitial sites of glass network [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ tab : e - fields ]    optical spectra calculations were performed by time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) method using octopus program @xcite and hartwigsen - goedecker - hutter pseudopotentials @xcite with spin polarization and spin - orbit interaction taken into account .",
    "pbe density functional @xcite was used in the ground - state calculation . to obtain the linear optical absorption spectrum of the system",
    ", the octopus code excites all frequencies of the system by giving certain ( small enough ) momentum to the electrons and then evolves the time - dependent kohn - sham equations in real space for a certain real time @xcite .",
    "the dipole - strength function ( or the photo - absorption cross section ) is then obtained by a fourier transform of the time - dependent dipole moment .",
    "adiabatic lda approximation is used in these calculations to describe exchange - correlation effects .",
    "the octopus code uses real - space uniform grid inside the sum of spheres around each atom of the system ( a single one in our case ) . the sphere radius and the grid spacing",
    "were taken to be was 8.0 and 0.25   , respectively , in our calculations .",
    "the real - time propagation was performed with @xmath15 time steps with the total simulation time of about 20  fs . the fourier transform was performed using third - order polynomial damping ( see @xcite for details of the code ) .    shown in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "are the calculated optical spectra of free @xmath1 dimer and of interstitial @xmath1 dimers in sixfold ring interstitial sites of networks of silica ( or germania or germanosilicate ) , alumosilicate , phosphosilicate and phosphogermanate glasses .",
    "figures  [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] display similar spectra for free and interstitial @xmath0 atoms and for free and interstitial @xmath12 ion , respectively . compairing the results for free @xmath1 dimers with previous configuration interaction calculations @xcite and those for free @xmath0 with experimental and theoretical data available @xcite ( see figure  [ fig:5 ] ) ,",
    "one readily sees that both transition wavelengths and transition intensities are described adequately in our tddft calculations .",
    "dimer ( dots ) and of interstitial @xmath1 dimers in silica , germania or germanosilicate ( with low germania content ) host ( short dashes ) , alumosilicate host ( dashes ) , in phosphosilicate or germanosilicate ( with high germania content ) host ( dashes plus dots ) and in phosphogermanate host ( solid ) ]    figure  [ fig:2 ] shows calculated optical spectra of interstitial @xmath1 dimer in comparison with those of a free dimer . similar spectra for interstitial @xmath0 atom are presented in figure  [ fig:3 ] . from figure  [ fig:2 ] it will be noticed how optical spectrum of an interstitial @xmath1 dimer is modified in comparison with free dimer .",
    "according to our previous calculations performed by configuration interaction ( ci ) method @xcite , absorption at 860 , 720 , 460  nm and @xmath16  nm wavelengths in the free @xmath1 dimer is caused by transitions from the ground state to the excited ones .",
    "the ir luminescence at 1450 , 1300 and 1050  nm wavelengths corresponds to spin - forbidden transitions from three lowest excited states to the ground state and the visible luminescence at 750  nm is caused to a spin - allowed transition with low oscillator strength from one of the other excited states to the ground state .",
    "notice that compairing results of ci calculations with optical spectra calculated in tddft with package ( such as shown in figures  [ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] ) one should realize that the latters include all possible transitions in the system under consideration .",
    "atom ( dots ; the part for energy @xmath17  ev multiplied by 10 for clarity ) and of interstitial @xmath0 atom in silica , germania or germanosilicate ( with low germania content ) host ( short dashes ) , alumosilicate host ( dashes ) , in phosphosilicate or germanosilicate ( with high germania content ) host ( dashes plus dots ) and in phosphogermanate host ( solid ) ]     ion ( dotted line ) and of interstitial @xmath12 ion in alumosilicate host ( solid line ) . ]    for the interstitial @xmath1 dimers , the absorption in the @xmath18  nm range and transitions corresponding to the absorption and visible luminescence in the 600  750  nm is found in our calculations to be practically unaltered in all the surrounding glass network compositions studied .",
    "the absorption band near 500  nm is found to be shifted towards shorter wavelengths ( near 440  nm in phosphogermanate environment ) and somewhat intensified . besides , absorption near 800  nm growths . in phosphate - bearing and in germanosilicate",
    "( with high content ) glasses absorption in the 900  1000  nm range becomes significant . in glasses with no phosphate component present and in germanosilicate glasses with low content",
    ", the ir luminescence is not too different from that in free dimers and occurring mainly in the 1000  1300  nm range .",
    "when passing to phosphate - bearing compositions and for high content one finds the ir luminescence bands to be shifted towards longer wavelengths , in the 1400  1600  nm range .    again",
    ", optical spectra of @xmath0 interstitial atoms are found in our calculations to change compared with those of free atoms ( figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "this change is relatively low in alumosilicate glasses where @xmath0 interstitial atoms give rise to absorption bands at @xmath16  nm , near 500  nm and in 600  700 and 900  1100  nm ranges .",
    "this absorption causes ir luminescence in 1000  1300 and 1400  1600  nm wavelength ranges .",
    "however the change turn out to be much more pronounced in phosphosilicate glasses and in germanosilicate glass with high germania content where the absorption should occur in 500  600  nm wavelength range and , especially , in 700  1000  nm range .",
    "the corresponding ir luminescence in these glasses is found to arise in 1000  1400  nm range and near 2000  nm .",
    "the above - described modification of optical spectra of bismuth interstitial dimers and atoms with composition of surrounding glass network gives an insight into origin of variations of absorption and ir luminescence bands discovered in bismuth - doped glasses @xcite .",
    "in particular , characteristic ir luminescence band shift from @xmath19  nm into the 1200  1400  nm range is observed while turning from alumosilicate compositions to phosphate - bearing ones .    ionization potential of the negative bismuth ion , @xmath12 , is known to be rather low : e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite the electron affinity of @xmath20bi is found to be @xmath21 or @xmath22  ev . because of this , all transitions in @xmath23  nm wavelength range should , in general , result in @xmath12 ionization with neutral @xmath0 atom formed and free electron occurred in conduction band . since optical cross - sections in @xmath12 ion are at least an order as high as those in @xmath0 atom , one would expect the interstitial @xmath12 ions are destroyed rapidly under both visible and ir irradiation .",
    "thus interstitial @xmath12 ions in glass may promote formation of interstitial negatively charged @xmath9 dimers @xcite . on the other hand , recombination luminescence in 1500  1700",
    "nm range is not improbable owing to conduction electrons capturing in @xmath0 interstitial atoms with @xmath12 ions formed .",
    "we have established , on modelling grounds , that interstitial negatively charged bismuth dimers , @xmath1 and @xmath10 , can actually occur in glass network and that absorption and luminescence spectra of the dimers correlate well with the experimental spectra of bismuth - doped glasses . on the other hand ,",
    "bismuth interstitial atoms , @xmath0 , and negative ions , @xmath12 , are demonstrated to occur in glass network as well . in particular , certain features observed in raman spectra of bismuth - doped alumosilicate glasses are attributable to both @xmath9 dimers and @xmath24 atoms ( ions ) present in glass together .",
    "so it would appear reasonable that both @xmath0 interstitial atoms and @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) negatively charged dimers occur in in bismuth - doped glasses as two types of the ir luminescence centres .",
    "relation between interstitial @xmath9 dimers and @xmath24 atoms ( and ions ) concentrations in the given glass is likely to depend predominantly on bismuth dopant content .",
    "it should be stressed that in bismuth - doped glasses considerable part of the dopant bismuth atoms are likely to be bonded with oxygen atoms of surrounding network .",
    "however such bismuth centres bear no relation to ir luminescence .",
    "it follows from the relation between calculated intensities of transitions corresponding to absorption and ir luminescence in @xmath0 atom that the ir luminescence time constant is considerably less than in @xmath1 or @xmath10 dimers and that it decreases rapidly with electrostatic field growth ( figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "similar calculations of @xmath9 dimers in electrostatic field prove the transition intensities to change only slightly and the transition wavelengths to change almost as rapidly as in @xmath0 atom with the field strength . therefore , interstitial @xmath0 atoms should give rise to much faster ir luminescence in comparison with @xmath1 and @xmath10 dimers .",
    "unfortunately the transition intensities in atoms and dimers are hardly to be compared directly in our calculational approach .",
    "rough estimate results in ratio of the order of 10 .",
    "thus , interstitial @xmath0 atoms may be responsible for  fast  component observed in ir luminescence .",
    "the calculations described in the present article and in ref .",
    "@xcite are concerned with sixfold ring interstitial sites .",
    "the sixfold ring are known to be the most abundant ring structure in silica- and germania - based glasses network .",
    "however there are other rings as well in such glasses , mainly five- , seven- and eightfold ones .",
    "we have performed some calculations for interstitial sites formed by pairs of such rings in alumosilicate network to examine equilibrium states of bismuth atoms and dimers and electric field strength .",
    "it is felt that the results and conclusions obtained for the sixfold rings still remain valid for sevenfold and , supposedly , in eightfold rings .",
    "the fivefold rings turn out to be too narrow to hold the interstitial dimers and , supposedly , atoms .",
    "in summary , we calculated optical spectra of interstitial negatively charged bismuth dimers , @xmath1 , neutral atoms , @xmath0 , and negative ions , @xmath12 , in network of silica- and germania - based glasses with various composition .",
    "considering our previous works @xcite , the results of the present calculations allow definite conclusions , as follows .",
    "* both interstitial @xmath1 and @xmath10 dimers and interstitial @xmath0 atoms and @xmath12 ions can occur in bismuth - doped silica- and germania - based glasses .",
    "ir luminescence in 1000  1600  nm in these glasses can be caused by all such interstitial centres .",
    "* ir luminescence decay time in @xmath0 atoms is estimated to be an order as short as in @xmath1 or @xmath10 dimers .",
    "hence @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) dimers and @xmath0 atoms can be assumed to cause  slow  and  fast  parts of the ir luminescence , respectively .",
    "* interstitial electric field strength dependence of absorption and ir luminescence in the interstitial @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) dimers is found to differ considerably from that in the interstitial @xmath0 atoms . pronounced dependence of the ir luminescence spectra and its excitation spectra on glass composition and bismuth content observed in several experiments may be attributable to the interstitial field variations .",
    "* interstitial @xmath0 atom is found to capture under certain conditions an electron from the glass conduction band with @xmath12 formed .",
    "recombination luminescence in the 1500  1700  nm is likely to occur owing to such capturing . on the other hand ,",
    "the interstitial negative @xmath12 ions are readily destroyed under @xmath23  nm irradiation .    thus our results of the present work and of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning interstitial bismuth atoms and negatively charged bismuth dimers in bismuth - doped glasses provide support for the conclusion that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) occur in these glasses as two types of the ir luminescence centres .",
