    "a lot of studies of the de sitter ( ds ) spacetimes have been done so far , mainly motivated by the inflation in the very early universe .",
    "recent observations also indicate that our universe has a small and positive cosmological constant @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this means that our universe would asymptote to the ds .",
    "the ds has the following interesting properties : it possesses the cosmological horizons and accordingly the conformal boundaries exist in its timelike infinity . as well as the black hole horizon",
    ", the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon has been studied @xcite . in principle",
    "the description of thermodynamics needs the knowledge of the microscopic physics .",
    "however , the existence of the cosmological horizons means the existence of the unobserved spacetime region and this fact makes it difficult to understand the origin of the entropy of ds spacetimes .",
    "one of the successful approaches to overcome this difficulty is the holography .",
    "the most striking example of the holography is the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence conjectured by maldacena @xcite .",
    "it states that type iib string theory on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 four dimensional yang - mills theory are equivalent .",
    "the equivalence includes the operator observable , the correlation function and the full dynamics .",
    "inspired by the ads / cft , the ds / cft correspondence was proposed by strominger @xcite .",
    "the ds / cft correspondence states that the dual description of the gravity in the ds spacetimes is the cft in the future and past conformal boundaries .",
    "this is intuitively explained as follows : the ds spacetime is obtained by the double wick rotation of the ads spacetime and hence the similar arguments are valid for the asymptotic structure and the holography .",
    "although it has no grounds in the string theory , there are many strong evidences @xcite which indicate the validity of the ds / cft correspondence .",
    "the impressive example is that the bulk scalar field corresponds to the cft on the conformal boundary",
    ". then this conjecture motivates us to study the properties of the higher dimensional ds spacetimes .",
    "furthermore , the ds / cft helps us to understand the desitter entropy@xcite .",
    "one of the interesting issues in these contexts is the dual description of the gravitational phenomena caused by the matter in the ( a)ds spacetimes ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the successful boundary description of the matter in the ads case ) .",
    "however , in the ds / cft case it is pointed out that the presence of matter drastically alters the causal structure @xcite .",
    "if a large amount of matter is present , the collapse of matter might cause the gravitational collapse . if there is no upper bound on the area of the black holes produced in this collapse , it can have the area larger than that of the cosmological horizon .",
    "this means the collapse of the whole spacetime .",
    "if this is the case , future timelike infinity is altered by a spacelike singularity and there is no conformal boundary on which the dual cft exists ( see also @xcite for similar issues in ads / cft correspondence and braneworld context ) .",
    "this implies the serious problem for the ds / cft correspondence .",
    "hence the role of the matter in the ds spacetimes should be investigated in detail .",
    "note that the ds has two conformal boundaries(@xmath5 ) and it may be controversial whether the ds / cft correspondence involves a single dual cft or two . in this paper",
    "we take the latter position as refs . @xcite .",
    "because we are now interested in the ds dynamics , it would be better to consider both past and future timelike infinities together .",
    "the related subject in four - dimensional ds spacetimes is the cosmic no - hair conjecture motivated by the inflationary universe .",
    "it states that all expanding universes with positive @xmath1 asymptotically approach the ds spacetimes for local observers @xcite .",
    "this indicates the existence of the conformal boundary at timelike infinity : even if the matter collapses , it does not cause the collapse of whole spacetime . in four dimensions",
    "cosmic no - hair conjecture was tested in the several situations and its validity has been confirmed except for some particular examples  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the area bound on the apparent horizon was discussed in @xcite , supporting the cosmic no - hair conjecture .",
    "thereafter the shell motion was also studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will examine some aspects of the gravitational collapse in five - dimensional ds spacetimes in order to obtain implications about the generality of the existence of conformal boundary at future timelike infinity in higher dimensions , which is essential to apply the ds / cft correspondence .",
    "we shall address this problem by two ways .",
    "one is to analyse the motion of shell - shaped matter in ds spacetime and its gravitational collapse .",
    "this would provide us some informations about the matter collapse in ds spacetime .",
    "the other is to discuss the area bounds on the black holes in the ds spacetimes because such bounds strongly indicates that the matter does not cause the collapse of the whole spacetime .",
    "we investigate the spherically - symmetric vacuum case and study the area of trapping horizons in rather general way .",
    "we will also study the area bounds on the apparent horizon numerically , setting the initial data generated by the spindle - shaped matter source in the ds spacetime .",
    "we would like to remark that the arguments in four dimensions can not be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions , since the argument is often relied on the four dimensional speciality .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section we study the motion of spherical dust shell . in sec .",
    "iii the area bounds on the event horizons and the apparent horizons are investigated using various examples .",
    "the schwarzschild - desitter black holes , trapping horizons in more general setting and the apparent horizons in the initial data are studied .",
    "finally we summarise our results in section iv .",
    "we use the unit @xmath6 throughout this paper .",
    "in this section , we study the dynamical motion of a spherically symmetric dust shell .",
    "this is the five - dimensional generalisation of the study in @xcite . by this analysis",
    "we might have some insights into the existence of the conformal boundary at future timelike infinity .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the trajectory of the thin shell which is the timelike hypersurface in the spacetime and divides the spacetime into the inside region @xmath8 and the outside region @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a unit normal to @xmath7 and we introduce the intrinsic metric @xmath11 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath12 .",

    "this metric is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ds radius @xmath26 and @xmath27 is related to the black - hole gravitational mass @xmath28 by @xmath29 .",
    "the metric on @xmath7 is written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the proper time of the dust shell and @xmath32 is the radius of the dust shell .",

    "we introduce @xmath38 .",
    "yield the equation of motion @xmath39 integrating with @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath40 the region @xmath41 is forbidden in the sense that the recollapse / the bounce occur at @xmath42 and the shell can not take such @xmath43 . @xmath44",
    "has the maximum @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 now we look at the details of the forbidden and allowed regions in the @xmath48-plane fixing @xmath49 . the case @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "[ shell ] .",
    "the allowed region is composed of four parts , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as we can see easily by eq .",
    ", there is no forbidden region for @xmath53 .",
    "this is depicted as the region @xmath54 fig .",
    "[ shell ] .",
    "it would be surprising that the forbidden region also does not exist for sufficiently large @xmath55 as depicted by the region @xmath52 . in these regions",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath52 the shell continue to collapse or expand depending on the initial condition .",
    "the spacetime approaches the ds spacetime if the shell expands and does the schwarzschild - ds spacetime if the shell collapses . in the region @xmath56 , due to the existence of the forbidden region ,",
    "the shell eventually collapses , even if it initially expands .",
    "the spacetime approaches the schwarzschild - ds spacetime . in the region",
    "@xmath57 the converse statement holds : the shell bounces even if it initially collapses and the spacetime evolves into the ds spacetime .",
    "the important lesson from this result is as follows . in the above analysis",
    "one can choose arbitrary values of the proper mass @xmath55 for a fixed gravitational mass @xmath27 .",
    "one would expect that @xmath58 provides the binding energy and the system would be bounded if it is negative",
    ". however , @xmath55 has the maximum value where recollapse occurs and the shell is not bounded for larger @xmath55 values , which is contradictory to our intuition .",
    "this is because large @xmath55 enlarges the second term of eq . and suppress the maximum of the potential .",
    "hence , we have an expectation that even there is large mass distribution in the ds spacetime , it would not be gravitationally bounded and would not cause the collapse of the whole spacetime .    in the next section",
    "we address this problem from somewhat different point of view : the bounds on the black - hole area in the ds spacetime .",
    "in this section we study the area bound on the black holes in five dimensional ds spacetimes . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "i , if the black - hole area has the upper bounds , it strongly indicates that the collapse of the whole spacetime does not occur even if the heavy matter exists .",
    "we begin with the schwarzschild - ds solution .",
    "the area bounds derived in this analysis is expected to have the generality because the schwarzschild - ds is the most symmetric configuration as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the metric is @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is related to the gravitational mass @xmath62 by @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 has two positive roots .",
    "the smaller one represents the location of the black hole event horizon @xmath65^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the other gives that of the cosmological event horizon @xmath66^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 coincide .",
    "if we further increase @xmath61 , there are no positive roots for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "therefore @xmath68 has the maximum value and accordingly the black hole mass and area have the following upper bounds : @xmath70 @xmath71 this suggests that the area of any black holes in asymptotically ds spacetimes is bounded above by @xmath72 .",
    "hence the formation of a large black hole is expected to be prohibited .",
    "this supports the existence of the conformal boundary at future infinity .",
    "to study this expectation further , we consider the trapping horizon in the next subsection , of which area bounds we can discuss more generally .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the trapping horizons in five - dimensional ds spacetimes following the procedure in @xcite without assuming the spherical symmetry .",
    "the existence of the trapping horizon is the sufficient condition for the event horizon formation , and the area bounds of the trapping horizon have implications about the black - hole area bounds .",

    "hence the area @xmath104 is bounded by the integral of the ricci scalar of the surface @xmath74 .",
    "this would be regarded as the manifestation of the black - hole area bounds in five - dimensional ds spacetimes .    in four dimensional cases",
    ", it is shown that the foliation @xmath74 of the trapping horizon has spherical topology @xcite using the gauss - bonnet theorem . as a result ,",
    "the area of the spatial section of the trapping horizon is bounded by that of the cosmological horizon @xcite . however , in the higher - dimensional cases we can not use the gauss - bonnet theorem or conclude such bounds in general . therefore we numerically study the area bounds further with a concrete example in the next subsection .",
    "in this subsection we study the area bounds on the apparent horizon by analyzing the four - dimensional initial data in a five - dimensional spacetime with positive @xmath1 .",
    "because the existence of the apparent horizon is the sufficient condition of the black hole formation , the area bounds on the apparent horizon gives some implications about those on the black hole . as the most simple example of the system without spherical symmetry we consider the uniform line - shaped distribution of matter .",
