    "polarised radio emission is fundamentally related to the presence of ordered magnetic fields , and observations of the polarisation properties of non - thermal radio emission are arguably the best way of studying quasi - regular fields and their structure .",
    "polarimetric observations have recently become available at the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) .",
    "it is important to be able to complete a polarisation calibration that reliably removes instrumental effects , so that the polarisation mode may be used for scientific purposes .",
    "there are two essential steps in the initial polarisation calibration for an alt - az mounted interferometer with circular feeds , such as the gmrt :    1 .",
    "firstly , the orthogonal polarisations of antenna feeds are never perfectly isolated , and corrections must be made for this polarisation ` leakage ' between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is typically carried out by observing an unresolved point source at the phase - centre over a range of parallactic angles , allowing for the separation of instrumental and source polarisation .",
    "when solving for the instrumental leakage , the absolute value of the phase offset between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is left as an unconstrained degree of freedom .",
    "this typically needs to be corrected by observing a source with known electric vector polarisation angle ( evpa ) .",
    "the calibrators 3c138 and 3c286 are generally used for this purpose at higher frequencies .",
    "these two steps provide an ` on - axis ' polarisation calibration , and reduce residual instrumental polarisation to a minimum at the phase - centre",
    ". this calibration can take significant computing time at the gmrt as the leakages vary rapidly across the band , so the calibration must be carried out on each spectral channel individually .",
    "any spurious instrumental polarisation results in leakage from stokes @xmath3 into the @xmath4 and @xmath5 images . following on - axis calibration at the gmrt",
    ", a residual instrumental polarisation of @xmath6% can typically be obtained at the phase - centre @xcite .",
    "however , the response of an interferometer varies across the primary beam , and wide - field polarimetry requires calibration of these ` direction - dependent ' or ` off - axis ' instrumental effects .",
    "similar to the case of on - axis calibration , the ` polarisation beam ' manifests itself with flux in total intensity leaking into the polarisation images .",
    "these polarimetric aberrations generally result in an increase in the observed fractional polarisation and also alter the absolute evpa of sources  with the effect typically becoming more pronounced with increasing distance from the phase - centre within the main lobe of the primary beam .",
    "direction - dependent effects therefore limit the dynamic range of low - frequency interferometric images and restrict the region of the primary beam that is useful for scientific measurement .",
    "the fundamental cause of direction - dependent instrumental linear polarisation is typically the curved reflecting surface , which slightly changes the direction of an incident electric vector upon reflection . for on - axis sources ,",
    "these polarimetric aberrations cancel out . for off - axis sources , the path length to the source from different parts of the reflecting surface",
    "are not all equal .",
    "these distortions increase with curvature @xcite .",
    "the general equations to compute the off - axis instrumental polarisation beam are given by @xcite . from a more observational perspective , and following @xcite , there are two kinds of beam polarisation that are theoretically expected :    1 .   beam squint : this occurs when the two circular polarisations point in different directions by a certain angle .",
    "beam squint tends to produce a ` two - lobed ' pattern , one positive and one negative .",
    "beam squash : this occurs when the two linear polarisations have different beamwidths by a certain amount .",
    "beam squash tends to produce a ` four - lobed ' pattern , in which two lobes on opposite sides of the beam centre have the same sign and two lobes rotated by @xmath7 have the opposite sign .",
    "this quadrupolar pattern tends to give rise to instrumental linear polarisation that is oriented radially with respect to the phase - centre .",
    "a classical model of beam squint / squash in prime - focus feeds suggests that beam squash can arise in @xmath4/@xmath5 due to two effects : the interaction of the linearly polarised vectors with the curvature of the reflecting surface , and the difference between the two polarisations in illumination of the primary surface ( which occurs from pseudo - waveguide modes in a feed ) .",
    "similarly , beam squint should arise in @xmath8 due to the feed not pointing directly at the vertex of the paraboloid .",
    "there is no anticipation of beam squint in @xmath4/@xmath5 or beam squash in @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "this was done for each holographic raster in each of the individual 220 channels across the band .",

    "the mean response across the band was calculated for each holography raster , so that the beam was described by a single datapoint per raster  creating a set of nine data per beam axis . each axis",

    "was not sampled along the diagonal axes , it was not possible to create a two - dimensional map at this frequency .    the polynomials describe the off - axis response for each stokes parameter as a function of radius from the phase - centre , and so were used to tangentially interpolate and grid the beam response around the phase - centre at a given radius .",
    "this was done using cubic spline interpolation in order to smoothly interpolate the sparsely sampled data over the large tangential distances .",
    "polynomial fitting may have given rise to significant runge s phenomena .",

    "[ beamfitsiq ] to [ beamfitsuv ] , appears similar to the azimuth - x axis .",
    "consequently , polarisation vectors along the elevation - x axis were oriented tangentially about the phase - centre in the initial @xmath4 and @xmath5 maps  in disagreement with the results of rm synthesis and the expected quadrupolar response of the gmrt polarisation beam , as discussed in @xcite .    attempts to correct for gmrt direction - dependent instrumental polarisation ( see section [ chap6:correctingresponse ] ) failed using this initial beam model , with the polarisation of all sources tending to increase .",

    "however , as clean is a non - linear algorithm , the average of separately imaged ` chunks ' of @xmath0-data is not identical to a single image of averaged @xmath0-data . this limitation has been overcome using a novel technique whereby the clean components from a stokes @xmath3 image are scaled by the previously mentioned @xmath26-dependent effects , and the response removed in the @xmath0-plane .",

    "the calibrators 3c138 and 3c286 are generally used for this purpose , with the rm and intrinsic evpa measured at higher frequencies being used to interpolate to lower frequencies .",
    "this interpolation limits the quality of evpa calibration , with errors in these _ a priori _ values propagating into measurements of the rm from a target source .",
    "these errors are enhanced as the rm of 3c286 is typically assumed to be exactly equal to 0  rad  m@xmath55 @xcite , with other calibrators being measured relative to 3c286 , and possibly adding a small systematic offset to a typically calibrated rm value .",
    "consequently , no source on the sky has had it s rm directly measured using circular feeds ; as is typical of interferometry , all rm measurements with circular feeds are _ relative _ to some value from a calibrator source .",
    "this is particularly problematic for wide - band spectropolarimetry at low frequencies , as the assumed evpa and rm of a calibrator source will be used to calibrate the source of interest .",
    "even a small offset between the assumed and actual values at high frequencies can lead to a large difference at low frequencies , as the faraday rotation scales with @xmath56 .",
    "this is possibly further exacerbated as different emitting regions within the source are possibly being probed at lower frequencies . in an illustrative example of the extent of this issue ,",
    "consider an evpa calibrator that is naively assumed to be well described by a single rm , but actually consists of multiple components at different faraday depths .",
    "the single rm is then used to calibrate an observation of a target source , which is actually fundamentally described by a single rm .",
    "the flawed assumptions made about the evpa calibrator will propagate into the target field , and rm synthesis of the ` calibrated ' target will erroneously yield multiple faraday components along the line of sight .",
    "furthermore , ionospheric variations and source variability also have an impact on the current techniques used for evpa calibration .",
    "there are also a low number of sources with both a known , and a stable , intrinsic evpa and rm at lower frequencies  where depolarisation effects are significant . overcoming",
    "this currently involves active searches for sources with ` low variability '  although these calibrator sources are rarely frequently monitored . even in cases where the calibrators are monitored for variability ,",
    "the variation is again only determined relative to yet another evpa calibrator .",
    "it is clear that polarisation angle calibration at low frequencies would be substantially improved if we could therefore manufacture a polarised source in the sky with well - defined and stable properties .",
    "we here suggest that having a suitable model of the wide - field response of an interferometer allows for evpa calibration to be applied using the spurious off - axis polarisation from any bright _ unpolarised _ source that is offset from the phase - centre . as the calibrator s",
    "` polarisation ' is a consequence of the antenna , such a correction process is independent of ionospheric faraday rotation .",
    "the process removes the need for calibration relative to any reference source , and instead makes the calibration relative only to the interferometer s primary beam . in this way , direction - dependent instrumental polarisation can become advantageous .",
    "we now test this method using the aips package , although the technique could be extended for use in other packages , such as casa or miriad , if desired . for the specific example of the gmrt ,",
    "the wide - field response is both frequency - independent and oriented radially . in such a case , in order to correct the data , the off - axis mixing of @xmath4/@xmath5 as described in equation [ qumixing ] has to be taken into account .",
    "we assume that the data has already been calibrated for the effects of the complex gains , and for the instrumental leakages using e.g.  pcal . during the standard step for polarisation angle calibration ,",

    "we then used the technique to apply a polarisation angle calibration to gmrt data at 325  mhz .",
    "our polarisation angle calibration was done using 3c48 , which is unpolarised at these frequencies , and was located @xmath31 away from the phase - centre .",

    "the instantaneous @xmath4/@xmath5 beams deduced at 325  mhz and 610  mhz are compatible with the basic model presented in section  [ intro ] , as the direction - dependent effects appear to scale with the fwhm of the stokes @xmath3 beam  implying that the beam squash is a result of interaction with the curved reflecting mesh , and not a consequence of the feed itself .",
    "the constraints placed on direction - dependent effects across the gmrt beam show that the snapshot 610  mhz instrumental response increases to @xmath69% at the half - power point , and increases rapidly to @xmath70% beyond 10% of the stokes @xmath3 beam .",
    "the measured beam squash suggests that mosaicing snapshot observations would not be sufficient to overcome off - axis effects at the gmrt , as the half - power point snapshot @xmath71 of @xmath69% at 610  mhz is greater than the expected median source polarisation of @xmath72% at this frequency .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite shows that this instantaneous instrumental polarisation can average down substantially over a large range in parallactic angle .",
    "the 325  mhz snapshot instrumental polarisation is similar to that at 610  mhz , and increases to @xmath69% at the half - power point , and to @xmath73% at 10% of the stokes @xmath3 primary beam .",
    "consequently , full - track observations should be used to reduce direction - dependent effects at the gmrt .",
    "the use of mosaicing would reduce these off - axis effects further by an additional factor of @xmath74 . as a conservative upper limit for observations taken over a large @xmath26-track ,",
    "the instrumental polarisation at 610  mhz is at most @xmath72% at the half - power point , increasing steadily to @xmath75% beyond 10% of the stokes @xmath3 beam .",
    "previous analyses of the 150  mhz gmrt beam are also possibly consistent with the off - axis response averaging down as a function of @xmath26 , with an instrumental polarisation of @xmath72% at the half - power point for a full - track observation @xcite",
    ". however , no measurements of the instantaneous 150  mhz beam are currently available . given the previously discussed scaling of direction - dependent effects with frequency , it is likely that the 150  mhz instantaneous beam is also simply a scaled version of the 610  mhz beam model shown in fig .",
    "[ allbeam ] .",
    "although not derived here , the scaling of the beam with frequency that is discussed in section  [ discusssubsection ] should in principle allow for the beam to be parameterised by a single mathematical function across all observing bands .",
    "this leads to the possibility that the gmrt stokes @xmath3 beam can also be defined by a single model for all frequencies , similar to the @xmath76 derived for the wsrt .",

    "coincident with the location of the feed support legs .",
    "peeling is often required at the gmrt at this frequency , and may be a result of time - variable direction - dependent gains caused by the stokes @xmath3 beam rotating on the sky with varying @xmath26 .",
    "it would be interesting to employ more refined beam models in @xmath80-projection algorithms , which are able to remove such effects .",
    "the classical model of beam squint suggests that for observations of circular polarisation with a parabolic reflector and a feed perfectly aligned with the vertex of the paraboloid , there is perfect circular symmetry and therefore no beam structure in @xmath8 .",
    "however , if the feed deviates slightly from the vertex along the @xmath81-direction , then the two circularly polarised beams will point in slightly different directions along the @xmath82-direction @xcite .",
    "this suggests that spurious @xmath8 emission could be more significant in azimuth at the gmrt , as the rotating feed turret ( which rotates about the elevation axis ) may not lock exactly into place and point directly towards the vertex of the dish .",
    "indeed , the stokes @xmath8 beam measured here is increased marginally in azimuth compared to elevation , by a magnitude of @xmath83% .",
    "it is possible the stokes @xmath8 beam therefore changes with each rotation of the feed turret .",
    "the polarisation beam corrections implemented in section [ chap6:correctingresponse ] are novel in that they directly correct the @xmath0-data using a stokes @xmath3 model of an observed field .",
    "these corrections have been used to successfully correct for direction - dependent instrumental polarisation  although by far less than had been hoped and with a number of limitations .",
    "the spurious linear polarisation is typically reduced by a factor of @xmath842 . although useful , the beam corrections work best at correcting instrumental effects beyond the half - power point .",
    "the computational expense is therefore unlikely to be worthwhile , particularly when an equivalent or better reduction of the instrumental effects could be achieved via the combination of large parallactic angle ranges and mosaicing .",
    "nevertheless , the corrections could be improved by implementing a cut - off for the stokes @xmath3 clean components , as noise and low - level artefacts that are cleaned in stokes @xmath3 currently get added into the linear polarisation images .",

    "[ sourcesbeforeandafter ] .",
    "this can be expected depending on the precise combination of source and instrumental polarisation , but may also suggest that the beam model is not sufficiently accurate .",
    "the latter is likely as the direction - dependent corrections implemented here reduce the instrumental polarisation most effectively at distances @xmath85 from the phase - centre i.e.  where the corrections are of a larger magnitude .",
    "limitations to the corrections may result from the decrease in signal - to - noise of rasters near to the phase - centre , significant beam variation between individual antennas , the coarse sampling used , or because of assumptions of @xmath26 constancy in each snapshot . in the corrections presented in this report ,",

    "new data are needed to improve the beam model and consequently the corrections .",
    "an attempt to monitor the beam out to the first sidelobe , with more axes , and less sparsely - sampled rasters would significantly enhance the model .",
    "the recommendation would be that tests are performed , the feed turret rotated , and the tests repeated in order to rule out epoch - dependent variations due to locking of the feed turret mechanism .",
    "this would also allow for checks on the observed change in sign along the elevation - x axis .",
    "such observations , if taken for all gmrt bands , may provide the possibility of describing the beam with a unified model which is a function of frequency .",
    "knowledge of a telescope s beam is extremely important , as demonstrated by the ability to calibrate the polarisation angle using an unpolarised source , when the direction - dependent response is known .",
    "this allows for corrections that are independent of ionospheric faraday rotation effects and a number of other low - level systematics .",
    "importantly , this technique can be extended down to arbitrarily low frequencies .",
    "improving the beam model at the gmrt is one of the most important endeavours that could currently be carried out to refine the instrumental response , and follow - up observations should be strongly considered .",
    "such observations may lead to improvements in the pointing model and dynamic range at all frequencies .",

    "<S> direction - dependent instrumental polarisation introduces wide - field polarimetric aberrations and limits the dynamic range of low - frequency interferometric images . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore provide a detailed two - dimensional analysis of the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) primary beam in full - stokes at 325  mhz and 610  mhz . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the directional dependence is essentially independent of the feed and is dominated by the curvature of the dishes reflecting mesh . </S>",
    "<S> the developed beam models are used to reduce wide - field instrumental polarisation in 610  mhz observations by subtracting the expected response from the @xmath0-data itself . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a new technique for polarisation angle calibration is presented that allows for calibration using an _ unpolarised _ source and therefore can be implemented at arbitrarily low observational frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has the advantage that it calibrates the polarisation angle independently of ionospheric faraday rotation and source variability . </S>",
    "<S> it also removes the need for known polarised sources on the sky  which are scarce at low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> we use the technique to retrieve the rotation measure of pulsar b1937 + 21 at 325  mhz , finding it to be consistent with previous independent measurements </S>",
    "<S> . an extended version of this method may be useful for verifying the calibration of other interferometers intended for polarimetric surveys . </S>"
