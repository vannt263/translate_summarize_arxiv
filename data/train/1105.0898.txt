    "in this paper , we consider the linear , isotropic elastic wave equation and cauchy initial value problem given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the displacement vector , @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the lam parameters , @xmath9 is the jacobian of @xmath1 and @xmath10 is its transpose .",
    "equivalently , we can write @xmath11 we will assume that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are independent of @xmath14 ; we will also assume that they are each positive , in that there is some positive constant @xmath15 so that @xmath16 , and later , we will make further assumptions about bounds and smoothness . throughout",
    ", we will assume that our initial - data , @xmath0 , is compactly supported in a set @xmath17 , which could , in general , be any bounded domain in @xmath18 , though for simplicity , we will take @xmath19 for some @xmath20 .",

    "our method is strongly inspired by the techniques of thermoacoustic tomography for scalar wave equations , and we adapt the time - reversal approach used by stefanov and uhlmann in @xcite . we devote the next section to discussing the existing results and methods in thermoacoustic tomography , and how they motivate the work in this paper .",
    "thermoacoustic tomography ( hereafter tat ) is a method of medical imaging where the object of interest is exposed to a short electromagnetic ( em ) pulse , absorbing some of the em energy in the process . because cancerous cells will absorb more of this energy than healthy cells will",
    ", it would be diagnostically useful to know the absorption function @xmath23 . to accomplish this",
    ", tat makes use of the elastic expansion in the nearby tissue caused by the energy absorption , as well as the fact that this initial pressure distribution is roughly proportional to the absorption distribution .",
    "this initial pressure , in turn , leads to a pressure wave @xmath24 that propagates through the object , and is then measured by transducers located on an observation surface @xmath25 surrounding the object for some length of time , the goal being to use this data to reconstruct the initial pressure .",
    "in much of the literature , the intended application is the imaging of cancer in a human breast , though some authors have written specifically about imaging the brain .",
    "this is somewhat more complicated , as the skull introduces a jump discontinuity in the sound speed , but under certain assumptions , recovery is still quite possible ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , we consider the scalar wave equation and cauchy initial value problem @xmath26 where @xmath27 , ( or more generally , @xmath28 , for some other metric @xmath29 on @xmath30 ) . the initial pressure function @xmath0 is typically assumed to be compactly supported inside of some bounded domain @xmath31 ( corresponding to the object to be imaged ) , though in some work , @xmath0 is taken to be supported in _",
    "some _ compact set , or even merely @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) . the observation surface @xmath25 is often taken to be @xmath34 ( sometimes referred to as _ complete data _ ) , though there are also satisfactory results for the case where @xmath25 is some other set , such as a portion of @xmath34 ( likewise ,",
    "_ incomplete data _ ; see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the data one then collects is @xmath35 and from this , the goal of tat is to recover @xmath0 .",
    "there are three main recovery methods used in tat , and their applicability depends largely on the assumptions made about the geometry and physical attributes of the medium ( in terms of @xmath17 and @xmath36 ) and the observation surface @xmath25 .",
    "we will briefly discuss some of these here ; for a detailed account and comparison of these techniques , including their relative advantages and disadvantages , see the excellent survey papers by hristova , kuchment and nguyen @xcite , or kuchment and kunyansky @xcite , @xcite .    in the method of filtered backprojection",
    ", one assumes that @xmath37 is constant ( i.e. the medium is acoustically homogeneous ) and that the observation surface @xmath25 is a sphere of radius @xmath38 .",
    "we can then recover @xmath0 through integral formulas such as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the spherical integrals of @xmath0 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the surface measures on the respective spheres . for more on the integral geometry approach to tat ,",
    "see the work of agranovsky , berenstein and kuchment @xcite , finch , patch and rakesh @xcite , xu and wang @xcite , finch , haltmeier and rakesh @xcite and kunyansky @xcite .",
    "the method of eigenfunction expansion applies to a slightly more general setting , in theory allowing @xmath37 to be variable , and for @xmath25 to be any closed surface ( i.e. @xmath43 for some @xmath17 ) .",
    "we then seek to write @xmath0 as a fourier series @xmath44 where @xmath45 are eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath46 in @xmath17 with dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath34 , and then find the coefficients @xmath47 using integral formulas",
    ". in @xcite , kunyansky showed , in the case @xmath25 is a cube and @xmath37 is constant , that @xmath0 can be recovered fast and precisely .",
    "of course , for a complicated set @xmath17 , or a variable speed @xmath36 , the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues may not be known , and it is not clear whether this method can be effectively implemented .    the third method ( and the method we will eventually use ) is known as time - reversal , and was first proposed by finch , patch and rakesh in @xcite , and first implemented by burgholzer , matt , haltmeier and paltauf in @xcite . here , @xmath37 is allowed to be variable ( i.e. the medium can be non - homogeneous ) , and the restrictions on the geometry of @xmath25 are far less than those of the other two methods .",
    "the key assumption is that there is good local energy decay , meaning that for @xmath0 compactly supported in @xmath17 , the energy of the solution in @xmath17 decays sufficiently fast as @xmath14 increases . to better illustrate the nature of this requirement",
    ", we first discuss an ideal case : the constant speed wave equation @xmath48 in @xmath49 . in this",
    "setting , huygen s principle would apply , and we would know that for some @xmath50 , @xmath51 inside @xmath17 for @xmath52 . in this case , we could recover @xmath0 by considering solutions of the initial value problem @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and then solving the problem in the reverse time direction , since @xmath55 by uniqueness .    of course , huygen s principle does not apply in the general setting , but there is a useful analog which still leads to strong results . to ensure the kind of energy decay we need",
    ", we will assume that the speed is _ non - trapping _ , meaning that all rays starting in @xmath17 leave in finite time , and that the supremum of these times is also finite .",
    "explicitly , for the hamiltonian @xmath56 , we consider the solutions in @xmath57 of the system @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( these solutions are called bicharacteristics , and their projections to @xmath61 are often called rays ) .",
    "we say that @xmath62 is non - trapping if each ray leaves @xmath17 in finite time , and the supremum of these times is finite as well . for a non - trapping @xmath62",
    ", we will call the supremum @xmath63 .",
    "one may gain additional understanding of the nature of this definition by considering an example of a trapping metric : consider @xmath64 , with @xmath17 an annulus @xmath65 . then , for @xmath59 , if @xmath66 is perpendicular to @xmath67 , it is straightforward to check that the resulting ray is @xmath68 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , which will remain inside @xmath17 for all time .        because singularities propagate along bicharacteristics , the non - trapping hypothesis also ensures that any singularities of @xmath0 will have left @xmath17 by @xmath63 , or put another way , that @xmath24 is a smooth function on @xmath17 for @xmath69 .",
    "this has been discussed extensively in the literature ; see for instance @xcite , @xcite or @xcite.[microlocal ]    because we can no longer assume that @xmath70 eventually vanishes inside @xmath17 , it would be incorrect to think that , for any finite time @xmath50 , solutions @xmath71 of will satisfy @xmath55 , at least not exactly . to alleviate this ,",
    "some authors have replaced the boundary condition by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a smooth cutoff function vanishing near @xmath74 , and @xmath75 near @xmath76 ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "stefanov and uhlmann used a different time - reversal method ( this will be discussed thoroughly in the final section of this paper ) , and showed that , for the acoustic wave equation with variable sound speed , it is possible to invert @xmath77 using a neumann series .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite , qian , stefanov , uhlmann and zhou went on to give a specific numerical algorithm for recovery based on this theoretical understanding . in this paper , we will follow the method of @xcite when possible , assuming that the absorption of em energy and subsequent elastic tissue expansion lead to elastic wave propagation instead of acoustic .",
    "the differences between scalar equations and systems will introduce some difficulties , the main difficulty being the unique continuation problem ; i.e. , determining when specifying cauchy data on a hypersurface @xmath78 is sufficient to uniquely determine the solution in a neighborhood of @xmath79 . for the classical case ( where the coefficients are smooth )",
    ", this is holmgren s theorem ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in the case of non - smooth coefficients for a scalar wave equation",
    ", there are good results due to tataru ( see @xcite,@xcite ) . for the static lam system ( i.e. the elliptic system @xmath80 ) , lin , nakamura , uhlmann and wang",
    "have recently shown ( in @xcite ) that there is a strong unique continuation principle ; specifically , if @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in @xmath30 with @xmath83 , if a solution is zero in a neighborhood of any point , it is identically zero . for the elastic wave equation , however , the situation is somewhat more subtle ; while some results exist , we will have to make assumptions about the lam parameters to acquire satisfactory results , the topic of the next section .",
    "one of the key attributes distinguishing the elastic wave equation from scalar wave equations is the presence of two speeds of propagation , the so - called p- and s - waves or modes ( also known as compression and shear waves or modes ) . in particular , these two speeds @xmath84 and @xmath85 correspond to the eigenvalues of the principal symbol of @xmath86 : @xmath87 it will be useful to define scalar wave operators corresponding with these speeds , and so with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we define @xmath90 by @xmath91 the property of finite speed of propagation for the elasticity system is essentially the same as the scalar case , as demonstrated by the following definition and theorem .",
    "we will say that @xmath1 has _ finite speed of propagation _ in @xmath92 , with maximum speed @xmath93 , if for any @xmath94 , @xmath95 in @xmath96 implies @xmath97 a.e . in the cone @xmath98 ,",
    "where @xmath99 .",
    "assume that @xmath100 , and suppose @xmath101 solves .",
    "then , for any open ball @xmath102 , @xmath1 has finite propagation speed in @xmath103 , with maximum speed @xmath104 .",
    "[ speed ]    for a proof , we direct the reader to @xcite . with this result in mind",
    ", we will hereafter assume that there exist constants @xmath105 so that @xmath106 we will also assume that @xmath107 is _ non - trapping _ , meaning ( recalling the definition and discussion for the scalar case given on page  ) that every ray ( i.e. the projection of every bicharacteristic starting in @xmath17 ) leaves @xmath17 in finite time , and that the supremum of these times , which we will again call @xmath63 , is also finite .    the presence of two speeds of propagation causes some difficulty regarding questions of unique continuation .",
    "for a homogeneous medium ( i.e. , the lam parameters are constant ) , the system is diagonalizable , and the p- and s - modes are preserved throughout the wave s evolution , effectively reducing this problem to the scalar case . in the more general",
    "setting however , p - waves may transmit or reflect as s - waves ( and vice - versa ) at an interface , making the question of unique continuation more subtle .",
    "for instance , if the p - wave vanishes on the boundary of a set for all time , one can not necessarily conclude it vanishes on the interior as well ; it may simply be transmitting as an s - wave instead .",
    "the extent to which the two modes can be decoupled is useful for understanding the reflection and transmission of singularities , and has been studied using the pseudodifferential calculus ( see @xcite and @xcite for smooth @xmath8 and @xmath7 , and most recently , @xcite for @xmath108 ) .    returning to unique continuation ,",
    "many satisfactory results have been proven via carleman estimates , and a thorough discussion can be found in the work of eller , isakov , nakamura and tataru , as well as that of cheng , isakov , yamamoto and zhou ( see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) and other authors . in the following two theorems",
    ", @xmath1 will be a solution of , @xmath109 is an open domain in @xmath18 , and @xmath110 will be some positive real number ( in practice , we will have @xmath111 containing @xmath17 , and @xmath110 larger than @xmath63 ) .",
    "both of these results are from @xcite ; the former is a slightly simplified statement of corollary 3.5 , and the latter is theorem 5.5 .",
    "( eller , isakov , nakamura , tataru ) + let @xmath112 , @xmath113 and assume , for some @xmath114 , they both satisfy @xmath115 and @xmath116 on @xmath117 \\times \\overline{\\omega ' } $ ] , that @xmath118 \\times \\overline{\\omega ' } ) $ ] , and that @xmath119 .",

    "[ tataru1 ]    assume that the coefficients @xmath125 are time independent .",
    "let @xmath79 be a noncharacteristic surface with respect to both @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "then we have unique continuation across @xmath79 for @xmath128 solutions @xmath1 to . [ tataru2 ]    with the assistance of these theorems",
    ", we conclude this section by proving a unique continuation result needed later for the reconstruction process .",
    "essentially , we seek to answer the following question :    suppose a solution @xmath1 of , with @xmath129 outside @xmath17 , also vanishes outside @xmath17 at some later time @xmath130 .",
    "from this , can we determine if @xmath131 inside @xmath17 as well ?",
    "because of finite propagation speed , this is certainly not the case for all times @xmath132 ( let @xmath130 be small , and let the support of @xmath0 be , for instance , some small ball contained in @xmath17 ) , and so we seek to describe sufficient conditions for making such a determination .",
    "suppose that @xmath133 are time independent , and that the maximum and minimum speeds of propagation satisfy the inequality @xmath134 that there exist @xmath135 , @xmath130 , and @xmath136 so that @xmath137 and that @xmath138 satisfy the gradient condition ( [ condition1 ] ) on @xmath139 \\times \\overline{b\\left(0,r + \\frac{t}{2}c^+ + \\epsilon \\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assume also that the surface @xmath140 is non - characteristic for @xmath141 .",
    "then , for solutions @xmath1 of ( with @xmath0 compactly supported in @xmath19 ) , if @xmath142 for @xmath143 , we have @xmath131 .",
    "[ uniqueness ]    by assumption , we know @xmath144 and since @xmath0 is compactly supported in @xmath17 , we know @xmath145 as well .",

    "thus , @xmath51 whenever @xmath124 , showing that @xmath159 , except possibly at the origin .",
    "theorem [ tataru2 ] allows us to extend this solution uniquely , and thus @xmath160 as well , showing @xmath161 .",
    "; the dashed region where @xmath120 by finite speed of propagation and time - reversal.,width=377 ]    before we continue , we make a few remarks about the conditions placed on the lam parameters in this theorem .",
    "first , the condition @xmath162 is needed to guarantee we can choose @xmath135 so that @xmath163 ; we need @xmath150 to ensure condition of theorem [ tataru1 ] is met , and @xmath164 is needed to ensure that the first inequality in is valid .",
    "this condition essentially reads , `` the speed of the s - wave must be more than a third that of the p - wave . '' for many materials , this is a realistic assumption ( for instance , this is true of most earth materials ) , though as mclaughlin and yoon note in @xcite , in biological tissue , this assumption may not be reasonable . in spite of this , because the observation surface is not a true discontinuity in the medium , it may be reasonable to expect that there is no exchange between the p- and s - modes , allowing us to work with a stronger form of unique continuation and drop the assumptions on the wave speeds .",
    "we will not pursue this issue any further in the present work , however .",
    "the gradient condition is somewhat more subtle , though making some additional hypotheses could help to simplify the situation .",
    "for instance , if we were able to assume that the medium is homogeneous outside some neighborhood of @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constant , so that @xmath165 ) , then the gradient condition simply reads @xmath150 outside that neighborhood . alternately ,",
    "if we were to make assumptions on the size of @xmath166 , say @xmath167 for some @xmath168 , then the condition could be reduced to @xmath169 again , at this point in time , we will leave such additional assumptions for future work , and continue with the hypotheses in the form stated in the theorem .",
    "as we have previously discussed , the success of the reconstruction process depends on good local energy decay , ensured by the non - trapping condition .",
    "before we move on to the reconstruction process , we will find it useful to specifically define two kinds of energy spaces associated with ; first for the initial data , and then for solutions . in",
    "what follows , @xmath170 is a domain in @xmath18 ( in practice , we will have @xmath171 or @xmath172 ) .",
    "we will begin by defining an inner product for the first space .",
    "for functions @xmath173 , let @xmath174 where @xmath175 indicates the trace . specifically , we have @xmath176    it is easy to see that @xmath177 is symmetric and bilinear . furthermore ,    for functions @xmath178 , we have @xmath179    using the identities",
    "@xmath180 @xmath181 and @xmath182 we have @xmath183 since @xmath184 , the second integral is zero by the divergence theorem , and we have @xmath185 .",
    "similarly , using @xmath186 will show @xmath187 .",
    "next , we define @xmath188 to be the completion of @xmath189 under the norm @xmath190 ( this quantity is essentially the total elastic energy of @xmath0 in @xmath170 , with a factor of @xmath191 omitted for convenience ) , and then define the energy space @xmath192 with the norm @xmath193 finally , we define the total energy for a function @xmath194 at time @xmath14 as @xmath195 i.e. , the total energy is the sum of the elastic and kinetic energies of @xmath1 at time @xmath14 . before moving on , we note that , as a consequence of these definitions , if @xmath1 solves with @xmath196 , then we have @xmath197",
    "now that we have all the necessary preliminaries in place , we are in the position to investigate the reconstruction process .",

    "the following theorem is our main result .",
    "recall that we say @xmath217 is _ non - trapping _ if every ray starting in @xmath17 exits in finite time , and the supremum of these times ( which we denote by @xmath63 ) is finite as well ( see page   for more discussion ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is compactly supported in @xmath17 , that @xmath217 is non - trapping and satisfies the hypotheses of theorem [ uniqueness ] , with @xmath218 .",

    "therefore , @xmath242 showing @xmath243    we next seek to show that this inequality is , in fact , strict .",
    "so , suppose that there is some @xmath0 so that @xmath244 .",
    "this implies that all the above inequalities are actually equalities as well , and in particular , @xmath245 , so that @xmath246 by theorem [ uniqueness ] , we then have @xmath247 , and thus @xmath248 for all non - zero @xmath196 .    now , we will show that @xmath220 is compact .",
    "we have that @xmath249 and @xmath250 are smooth as functions on @xmath251 because @xmath218 ( all singularities beginning in @xmath17 will have left ) , and so , as linear operators acting on @xmath0 , they have smooth schwarz kernels .",
    "this will also imply @xmath206 is smooth , by elliptic regularity . from this",
    ", we can see that the map @xmath252 has a smooth kernel , and is therefore compact .",
    "next , we note that the solution operator of from @xmath253 to @xmath254 ( i.e. , the map @xmath255 ) is bounded in @xmath256 ( unitary , actually , because @xmath257 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the map @xmath258 is compact , as the composition of a compact and a bounded map , finally allowing us to conclude @xmath259 , and the proof is complete .",
    "it is additionally worth noting that , in addition to uniqueness , the proof of this theorem also gives insight into the stability of this problem .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath260 providing a bound on @xmath261 in terms of the local energy decay . furthermore , because @xmath262 , this also describes the error in the reconstruction if we only use the first term @xmath263 of the neumann series . additionally ,",
    "if @xmath130 is chosen so that the hypotheses of theorem [ uniqueness ] are satisfied , but @xmath264 , then we can still conclude that @xmath265 for all non - zero @xmath0 , but we can no longer be sure @xmath220 is compact , and thus have no reason to expect @xmath261 is _ strictly _ less than @xmath266 . finally , if @xmath267 , then one can find a non - zero @xmath0 so that @xmath244 ( by choosing an @xmath0 supported in a small enough ball , finite speed of propagation will imply @xmath142 outside of @xmath17 ) .",
    "while we have suggested a method of reconstruction for thermoacoustic tomography in elastic media , and demonstrated the uniqueness and stability of this method , there is still much work to be done .",
    "indeed , we have only explored the case of complete data , and in practical applications , such as breast imaging and geophysical imaging , one can only expect to be able to measure data on a portion of the boundary .",
    "thus , examining the problem of incomplete data will be critical to the practical relevance of the elastic approach , and should be explored in future work .",
    "as previously mentioned , various authors ( again , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have investigated this problem for the acoustic wave equation , and produced satisfactory results ; perhaps by adapting these methods , good results can be obtained for setting of elastic media as well .",
    "furthermore , we have worked with the restriction that @xmath268 , which , as mentioned , is a reasonable hypothesis for earth materials , but not necessarily for biological tissue .",
    "this assumption may be stricter than actually needed , and so it would be nice to find an alternative to using @xcite in the uniqueness step . at this point , it is not clear how to accomplish this , but perhaps by adapting the methods ( rather than the results ) of eller , isakov , nakamura and tataru some progress can be made .",
    "indeed , in their work the coefficients @xmath269 are generally allowed to vary in time and be of relatively limited smoothness ( e.g. , @xmath270 ) ; possibly by relaxing these assumptions , a better unique continuation result can be obtained .",
    "finally , developing computer simulations and attaining numerical data based on the method proposed in this paper are an obvious next step for this approach to mature from theory to application . as we discussed earlier , this has already been done for the acoustic case ( in @xcite and others ) , and hopefully computational methods can be developed for elastic media in the near future .",
