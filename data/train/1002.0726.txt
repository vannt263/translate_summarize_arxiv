    "this paper is the follow up of previous work @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) where we demonstrated a very good agreement between the analytical post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation and the numerical gravitational self - force ( sf ) for circular orbits in the perturbed schwarzschild geometry . the first step had been taken by detweiler @xcite who showed agreement at 2pn order using the existing pn metric @xcite.pn order refers to terms equivalent to @xmath0 beyond newtonian theory , where @xmath1 is a typical internal velocity of the material system and @xmath2 is the speed of light . ]",
    "motivated by this result we pushed the pn calculation in paper i up to the 3pn level .",
    "this is particularly interesting because the 3pn approximation necessitates an extensive use of dimensional regularization to treat the divergent self - field of point particles .",
    "the successful comparison reported in paper i confirmed the soundness of both the traditional pn expansion ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the perturbative sf analysis @xcite in describing the dynamics of compact binary systems  notably , regarding subtleties associated with the self - field regularizations in use in both approaches .",
    "this comparison dealt with the conservative part of the dynamics , but previous comparisons between the pn and the sf had checked dissipative effects @xcite .",
    "in paper i we also showed that the quality of the numerical sf data is such that substantial physical information remains far beyond 3pn order , i.e. is contained within the numerically derived residuals obtained after subtracting the known 3pn terms from the data ( see fig .  3 of paper i ) .",
    "in the present paper we explore further the higher - order pn nature of the numerical data .",
    "we point out that knowing analytically determined appropriate pn parameters helps tremendously in allowing our numerical data to be used to obtain higher order pn terms .",
    "in particular , we show that prior analytic information from pn theory regarding the presence of _ logarithmic _ terms in the pn expansion is crucial for efficiently extracting from the sf data the numerical values of higher order pn coefficients .",
    "the occurence of logarithmic terms in the pn expansion has been investigated in many previous works @xcite .",
    "notably anderson _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that the dominant logarithm arises at the 4pn order , and blanchet & damour @xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that this logarithm is associated with gravitational wave tails modifying the usual 2.5pn radiation - reaction damping at the 1.5pn relative order .",
    "furthermore the general structure of the pn expansion is known @xcite : it is of the type @xmath3^q$ ] , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are positive integers , involving only powers of logarithms ; more exotic terms such as @xmath6^q$ ] can not arise . in the present paper",
    "we shall determine the leading 4pn logarithm and the next - to - leading 5pn logarithm in the conservative part of the dynamics of a compact binary system .",
    "consider two compact objects with masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( without spins ) moving on exactly circular orbits .",
    "the dissipative effects associated with gravitational wave emission are neglected , which is formalized by assuming the existence of a helical killing vector field @xmath9 , being null on the light cylinder associated with the circular motion , time - like inside the light cylinder ( for instance at the particle s location ) and space - like outside ( including a neighborhood of spatial infinity ) .",
    "then we consider a particular gauge invariant observable quantity @xcite defined as the constant of proportionality between the four - velocity of one of the masses , say @xmath7 , and the helical killing vector evaluated at the location of that particle , i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 the quantity @xmath12 represents the redshift of light rays emitted from the particle and received on the helical symmetry axis perpendicular to the orbital plane @xcite ; we shall sometimes refer to it as the redshift observable . adopting a coordinate system in which the helical killing vector field reads @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the orbital frequency of the circular motion , we find that the redshift observable reduces to the @xmath15 component @xmath16 of the particle s four - velocity , namely @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the ordinary coordinate velocity used in pn calculations , and @xmath19 denotes the metric being evaluated at the particle s location by means of an appropriate self - field regularization , i.e. mode - sum regularization in the sf approach , and dimensional regularization in the pn context .",
    "the point is that @xmath12 can be computed as a function of the orbital frequency @xmath14 in both the pn approach for any mass ratio , and in the perturbative sf framework when the mass @xmath7 is much smaller than @xmath8 . summarizing the analytical 3pn result of paper i and present computation of the 4pn and 5pn logarithmic terms in secs .",
    "[ secii][secv ] , we obtain the sf contribution to the redshift observable as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a pn parameter associated with the lighter mass @xmath7 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote some purely numerical coefficients left out in the pn calculation .",
    "however , having obtained theoretical predictions for the 4pn and 5pn logarithmic terms , we are able to perform an efficient fit to the numerical sf data and to accurately measure the other non - logarithmic 4pn and 5pn coefficients .",
    "we find @xmath24 and @xmath25 where the uncertainty in the last digit is in parenthesis .",
    "furthermore we can also measure the 6pn coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( such that @xmath28 is the factor of @xmath29 ) , and give an estimate of the total contribution of the 7pn coefficient ( including both logarithmic and non - logarithmic terms ) ; see table [ bestfit ] and fig .",
    "[ bestfig ] in sec .",
    "[ secvid ] .",
    "the 3pn coefficient @xmath30 is also found to be in agreement with the sf data with high precision .",
    "the non - logarithmic coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath31 would be extremely difficult to obtain with standard pn methods .",
    "their computation would require in particular having a consistent self - field regularization scheme ; for instance it is not guaranteed that dimensional regularization which has been so successful at 3pn order could be applied with equal success at much higher orders .",
    "nevertheless these coefficients are obtained here for the first time with reasonable precision up to the impressive 7pn order .",
    "this emphasizes the powerfulness of the perturbative sf approach and its ability to describe the strong field regime of compact binary systems , which is inaccessible to the pn method .",
    "of course , the limitation of the sf approach is the small mass - ratio limit ; in this respect it is taken over by the pn method .",
    "the analytical and numerical results obtained in this paper up to 7pn order could be used for the synthesis and calibration of template waveforms of extreme mass ratio inspirals to be observed by the space - based gravitational wave detector lisa .",
    "they are also relevant to analyses that combine numerical computations in a quantitative analytical framework for the generation of inspiral waveforms for the ground - based ligo and virgo detectors .",

    "this general discussion is followed in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] by the explicit computation of the leading order 4pn and next - to - leading order 5pn logarithmic terms in the near - zone metric of an arbitrary post - newtonian source , and then of a compact binary system .",

    "then with this convention we see that the powers of @xmath87 in are set by dimensionality .",
    "a useful lemma @xcite is the fact that the multipolar order @xmath34 is necessarily constrained by the following two inequalities : @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the number of spatial indices among @xmath90 and @xmath91 , i.e. the `` spin '' given by @xmath92 according to @xmath93 .",
    "the lemma will serve at controlling the pn order of `` branches '' of logarithmic terms arising in the mpm iteration of the external field . already we know @xcite that the powers of the logarithms are limited to @xmath94 in the source term @xmath95 .",
    "after integration of the source term @xmath95 we shall find the corresponding solution @xmath96 which will admit the same type of nz expansion as its source .",
    "however the maximal power of the logarithms in the solution will be increased by one unit with respect to the source and is thus limited by @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath98 in @xmath96 .",
    "for instance this means that logarithms squared can not arise before the cubic non - linear order @xmath99 .    to control the occurence of logarithms in the near - zone it will be sufficient to integrate the source by means of the integral of the `` instantaneous '' potentials defined by formal pn iteration of the inverse laplace operator @xmath100 , say @xmath101 .",
    "this is because any homogeneous solution to be added to that particular solution will have the structure of a free multipolar wave ( retarded or advanced ) whose near - zone expansion can not contain any logarithms .",
    "however , when acting on a multipolar expanded source term , valid only in the exterior of the matter source and becoming singular in the formal limit @xmath68 , we must multiply the source term by a regulator @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is a complex number and @xmath104 is the length scale associated with the orbital motion . after applying the instantaneous propagator",

    "this solution will be a mixture of purely retarded and advanced multipolar waves , say of the type @xmath109 and @xmath110 , but the point is that the nz expansion of @xmath108 when @xmath68 clearly does not contain any logarithms .",
    "so in order to control the logarithms we can ignore the homogeneous piece @xmath108 .",
    "as argued in @xcite the use of the latter `` instantaneous '' propagator , say @xmath107 , corresponds to keeping only the conservative part of the dynamics , i.e. neglecting the dissipative part associated with gravitational radiation - reaction .",

    "on the other hand the `` far - zone poles '' for which @xmath129 have the structure @xmath130^m\\,.\\ ] ] these poles become singular when @xmath68 .",
    "we shall argue later that the associated logarithms do not contribute to the pn expansion of quantities we compute in this paper ( like the redshift observable or the conserved energy of a compact binary system ) .",
    "we can now easily control the pn order of these poles .",
    "taking into account all the powers of @xmath87 and the fact that @xmath131 , we obtain @xmath132 next , the inequality in the left of the lemma provides a uniform bound of the pn order of each of the terms in , leading to @xmath133 this means that the nz poles in the @xmath66-th non - linear metric are produced at least at the @xmath134pn level ; note that the power of @xmath87 in the @xmath135 components of the perturbation @xmath96 , such that @xmath136 , gives immediately the pn order .",

    "notice that the far - zone poles come earlier than the near - zone ones in the pn iteration .",
    "we use these general results to control the occurence of ( powers of ) logarithms in the pn expansion .",
    "first be careful that our findings do not mean that all the logarithms at some @xmath66-th non - linear order will have the pn orders and ; it states that whenever _",
    "new logarithms _ appear they are necessarily produced at least at these pn levels . however , once a `` new '' logarithm has been produced in @xmath96 , it will contribute in the source term @xmath139 of the next iteration , and therefore will also appear in the corresponding solution @xmath140 where it needs not to be associated with a pole occuring at that order .",
    "in fact we expect that the vast majority of logarithms only come from the iteration of original logarithms seeded by poles .",
    "such `` iterated '' logarithms will escape the rules and .    given a logarithm at order @xmath66 coming from a nz pole and being thus at least of order @xmath134pn , we can check that it will generate iterated logarithms at any subsequent non - linear order @xmath141 , with @xmath142 , and that those will be at least of order @xmath143pn .",
    "we can therefore always bound the pn order of the complete family of iterated nz logarithms by the order @xmath134pn of the `` seed '' logarithm .",
    "we get the same pn order as the seed logarithm because according to the @xmath135 component of the metric perturbation @xmath144 is of order @xmath145 , and hence generates at the next iteration a term of order @xmath146 in the 00 component of the metric perturbation @xmath147 ( via the non - linear source term @xmath148 ) , which is still of @xmath134pn order .",
    "we shall use later the trick that by gauging away the @xmath135 component of the metric perturbation we can greatly simplify the computation of the subsequent iteration .",
    "] the same reasoning applies for the pn orders of the iterated fz logarithms which are bounded from below by the @xmath138pn order of the seed .    when @xmath149 we find from that there is a family of nz logarithms starting at the 4pn order .",
    "we know that the 4pn logarithmic term is associated with gravitational wave tails ; it has been computed for general matter sources in @xcite .",
    "conjointly with this 4pn logarithm there will be also logarithms at 5pn and higher orders , all of them at quadratic order @xmath149 , and all these quadratic logarithms will have to be iterated at the next cubic order @xmath99 , and so on . as we discussed",
    "this defines a complete family of nz logarithms , and this family will be sufficient to control all the nz logarithms at 4pn and 5pn orders .",
    "indeed , we expect that at cubic order @xmath99 a new family of nz logarithms will appear , but according to the result this new family will be of order 5.5pn at least .",
    "in particular this reasonning shows that the dominant nz logarithm _ squared _",
    "@xmath150 ^ 2 $ ] is at least 5.5pn order .",
    "such 5.5pn logarithm would be time odd in a time reversal and belongs to the dissipative radiation - reaction part of the dynamics so we shall ignore it .",
    "similarly the next family coming at the quartic approximation @xmath151 will be at least 7pn  thus the dominant @xmath150 ^ 3 $ ] is expected to appear at least at 7pn order .",
    "we shall now argue that only the family of nz logarithms starting at the 4pn order needs to be considered for the present computation , because quite generally the fz logarithms can not contribute to the conserved part of the dynamics of a compact binary system .",
    "the fz logarithms are generated by seeds whose pn order is controlled by the estimate .",
    "first one can check that due to the particular structure of the quadratic metric @xmath149 there is no fz pole at the quadratic order @xcite .",
    "the fz logarithms come only at the cubic order @xmath99 and from the estimate we see that they arise dominantly at 3pn order , i.e. earlier than the nz logarithms at 4pn order .",
    "the 3pn far - zone logarithms have been investigated in @xcite and also in previous work @xcite .",
    "however we do not need to consider these and other fz logarithms in the present calculation as the following argument shows .",
    "the nz and fz logarithms were investigated using the operator of the `` instantaneous '' potentials defined by [ see eq .  ] @xmath152 = \\mathop{\\mathrm{fp}}_{b=0}\\,\\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{c\\partial t}\\right)^{2k}\\!\\!\\delta^{-k-1}\\left[\\left(\\frac{r}{\\lambda}\\right)^b \\overline{n}_{n}\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] this propagator depends on the length scale @xmath112 .",
    "now our basic assumption is that in order to treat the conservative part of the dynamics , admitting the helical killing vector @xmath13 in the two - body case , one should integrate the field equations with the propagator in which we set @xmath76 . in this way",
    "the conservative dynamics will fundamentally depend on the scale @xmath112 coming from the killing symmetry and explicitly introduced through the propagator .",
    "by contrast , in a physical problem where we look for the complete dynamics including both conservative and dissipative ( radiation - reaction ) effects , there is no preferred scale such as @xmath112  indeed , nothing suggests that the dynamics should depend on some pre - defined scale @xmath112 . in this case",
    "we integrate the field equations using the standard retarded integral , i.e. @xmath153 = \\mathop{\\mathrm{fp}}_{b=0}\\,\\frac{-1}{4\\pi}\\int\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^3 x'}{\\vert\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}'\\vert}\\left(\\frac{\\vert\\mathbf{x}'\\vert}{\\lambda}\\right)^b n_{n}\\left(\\mathbf{x}',t-\\vert\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}'\\vert / c\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] the non - linear source term @xmath65 is in unexpanded form since we integrate in all the exterior of the source and not only in the nz as in .",
    "but , as in , we have introduced a regulator @xmath154 and a finite part to cure the divergencies of the multipole expansion at the origin of the coordinates .",
    "because of this regulator , the retarded integral depends on the scale @xmath112 which must therefore be _ cancelled _ by other terms in the physical metric .",
    "what happens is that the dependence on @xmath112 coming from integrating the non - linearities using is cancelled by a related dependence on @xmath112 of the multipole moments of the source which parametrize the linear ( retarded ) approximation .",
    "the source multipole moments can be written as integrals over the pseudo stress - energy tensor of the matter and gravitational fields @xcite . because of the non - compactness of the gravitational field the integral extends up to infinity and involves a similar regulator @xmath154 dealing with the boundary of the integral at infinity .",
    "the final independence of the physical metric on @xmath112 can be checked by formally differentiating the general expression of the metric found in @xcite .",
    "the cancellation of @xmath112 has been explicitly verified up to the 3pn order in the case of compact binaries @xcite .    what is the difference between the physical situation and the `` unphysical '' one in which we would use the propagator ? to compare the two situations we expand the retarded integral in the near - zone .",

    "regular _ in the source .",
    "we know that the multipolar functions @xmath156 parametrizing this solution are associated with non - linear tails and their expressions can be found in @xcite . in the physical case ,",
    "the homogeneous solution in will remove the @xmath112-dependence located in the nz logarithms appearing from the first term , and which have the symbolic nz structure @xmath157 . on the other hand the @xmath112-dependence in the fz logarithms @xmath158 ,",
    "is removed by the retarded homogeneous solution we start with at the linear approximation .",
    "now in the unphysical situation we shall want to subtract the anti - symmetric solution in in order to use the instantaneous propagator @xmath107 .",
    "therefore the scale @xmath112 will no longer be cancelled from the _ near - zone _ logarithms @xmath157 which will thus remain as they are .",
    "suppose that they are evaluated at the location of a body in a two - body system , then the nz logarithms become @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the position of the body , and hence @xmath161 in the frame of the center of mass , where @xmath162 is the two - body s separation .",
    "using kepler s law the logarithm becomes @xmath163 where @xmath164 is a standard pn parameter , showing that the nz logarithms do contribute to the final result .    on the contrary the fz logarithms @xmath158 will not .",
    "indeed the scale @xmath112 therein will still be cancelled out by the linear retarded solution .. ] this means that in the application to binary systems the final fz logarithms are scaled not by @xmath112 but rather by the size @xmath162 of the orbit , and become some @xmath165 . when considered at the location of one of the bodies we get",
    "@xmath166 which clearly does not contribute in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the latter reasoning is rather formal because the multipole expansion is valid only outside the source and it does not _ a priori _ make sense to apply it `` at the location of one particle . ''",
    "however the reasoning may be better justified from a matching argument suggesting that the multipole expansion is valid `` everywhere '' , in a restricted sense of formal asymptotic series .",
    "our conclusion is that we do not need to consider the fz logarithms . from the previous investigation",
    "we see that it is sufficient to consider the family of iterated nz logarithms generated at the quadratic order @xmath149 , and to compute the 4pn and 5pn logarithms within this family .",

    "we denote a standard error @xmath318 representing the numerical error in @xmath312 by @xmath319 where @xmath320 is being used as a placeholder to identify our estimate of the errors in our numerical results .",
    "a common task in physics is creating a functional model for a set of data . in our problem",
    "we have a set of @xmath321 data points @xmath322 and associated uncertainties @xmath323 , with each pair evaluated at an abscissa @xmath324 .",
    "we wish to represent this data as some model function @xmath325 which consists of a linear sum of @xmath52 basis functions @xmath326 such that @xmath327 the numerical goal is to determine the @xmath52 coefficients @xmath328 which yield the best fit in a least squares sense over the range of data .",
    "that is , the @xmath328 are to be chosen such that @xmath329 ^ 2 \\label{chi2def}\\ ] ] is a minimum under small changes in the @xmath328 . for our application",
    "we choose the basis functions @xmath326 to be a set of terms which are typical in pn expansions , such as @xmath330 , @xmath331 ,  , and also terms such as @xmath332 .",
    "our analysis depends heavily upon ref .",
    "@xcite ; we use both the methods and the computer code for solving systems of linear algebraic equations as described therein .",
    "while we do employ standard , least squares methods for solving a system of linear equations to determine the @xmath328 , we also recognize that a solution to this extremum problem is not guaranteed to provide an accurate representation of the data @xmath333 .",
    "the quality of the numerical fit is measured by @xmath334 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ chi2def ] ) .",
    "if the model of the data is a good one , then the @xmath335 statistic itself has an expectation value of the number of degrees of freedom in the problem , @xmath336 , with an uncertainty ( standard deviation ) of @xmath337 .",
    "in particular , a large residual @xmath334 would correspond to under - fitting the data whereas a @xmath334 that is too small corresponds to over - fitting the data , which amounts to fitting randomness in the residuals .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the fitting coefficient @xmath328 includes a determination of its uncertainty @xmath338 which depends upon i ) the actual values of @xmath324 in use , ii ) all of the @xmath323 , and iii ) the set of basis functions @xmath326 .",
    "in fact , the estimate of the @xmath338 depends solely upon the design matrix @xmath339 and not at all on the data ( or residuals ) being fitted .",
    "however , the estimates of the @xmath338 are only valid if the data are well represented by the set of basis functions . for emphasis :",
    "the @xmath338 depend upon @xmath340 and upon @xmath323 but _ are completely independent _ of the @xmath322 . only if the fit is considered to be good , could the @xmath338 give any kind of realistic estimate for the uncertainty in the coefficients @xmath328 . if the fit is not of high quality ( unacceptable @xmath334 ) , then the @xmath338 bear no useful information @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point in the discussion below .    a further remark concerning the meaning of the @xmath338 is appropriate .",
    "fitting the data as described to determine the coefficients is a standard ,",
    "well defined statistical procedure .",
    "if we were to change the integration routine used to generate the @xmath341 , which are the set of input data values @xmath322 , with the restriction that we maintained the same numerical accuracy then the @xmath322 would each change in a random way governed by @xmath323 . if the coefficients @xmath328 were then determined for this second data set , the statistical analysis ensures that the @xmath338 associated with this second data set would be identical to those of the first set and the newly determined estimates of the @xmath328 would differ from the initial ones in a statistical fashion governed by the @xmath338 . recall that the @xmath338 depend upon the choice of the @xmath324 , upon the @xmath323 for the individual data points and upon the set of basis functions @xmath326",
    "the @xmath338 are completely independent of the data values @xmath322 .",
    "now we consider two other possible changes .",
    "if we add an extra data point , or if we add another basis function not orthogonal to the others ( this would be typical over a finite set of data points , unless we carefully engineered otherwise ) the design matrix changes accordingly , all estimated coefficients @xmath328 change accordingly , and the estimated @xmath338 change in ways which are not easily related to the previous results .",
    "in particular , if we add an additional basis function @xmath342 to the previous set , so there is now one more coefficient @xmath343 to be fit , and we compare the first @xmath52 values of the new @xmath328 to their earlier values , their differences need not be closely related to either the first or second set of @xmath338 .",
    "thus , a change in the design matrix of the problem leads to an inability to make any intuitive prediction about what to expect for the new @xmath328 , and there is no reason to expect that the differences of the @xmath328 respect the values of the @xmath338 for these two different statistical problems .",
    "we also should remark that the task of determining coefficients in the @xmath168 characterization of our numerical data is almost incompatible with the task of determining an asymptotic expansion of @xmath312 from an analytic analysis .",
    "analytically , the strict @xmath344 limit is always technically possible , whereas numerically , not only is that limit _ never _ attainable , but we must always contend with function evaluations at just a finite number of discrete points , obtained within a finite range of the independent variable , and computed with finite numerical precision . nevertheless , this is what we intend to do .    in practice ,",
    "the numerical problem is even more constrained . at large @xmath70 , even though the data may still be computable there , the higher order terms for which we are interested in evaluating pn coefficients rapidly descend below the error level of our numerical data .",
    "this is clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ bestfig ] below . for small @xmath70 ,",
    "the introduction of so many pn coefficients is necessary that it becomes extremely difficult to characterize our numerical data accurately .",
    "thus , in practice , we find ourselves actually working with less than the full range of our available data . at large @xmath70",
    "we could effectively drop points because they contribute so little to any fit we consider . at the other extreme ,",
    "the advantage of adding more points in going to smaller @xmath70 is rapidly outweighed by the increased uncertainty in every fitted coefficient .",
    "this results from the need to add more basis functions in an attempt to fit the data at small @xmath70 .",
    "further details will become evident in sec .",
    "[ secvid ] below .      in a generic fashion",
    "we describe an expansion of @xmath345 in terms of pn coefficients @xmath346 and @xmath347 with @xmath348 where @xmath349 is the newtonian term , @xmath350 is the 1pn term and so on .",
    "similarly , for use in applications involving @xmath289 we also introduce the coefficients @xmath351 and @xmath352 in the expansion of the sf contribution @xmath353 these series allow for the possibility of logarithmic terms , which are known not to start before the 4pn order . we also concluded in sec .",
    "[ secii ] that @xmath354 terms can not arise before the 5.5pn order . since we are computing a conservative effect , possible time - odd logarithmic squared contributions at the 5.5pn or 6.5pn orders do not contribute .",
    "but there is still the possibility for a conservative 7pn @xmath354 effect , probably originating from a tail modification of the dissipative 5.5pn @xmath354 term .",
    "however , we shall not permit for such a small effect in our fits . as discussed below in sec .",
    "[ secvid ] , we already have problems distinguishing the 7pn linear @xmath355 term from the 7pn non - logarithmic contribution .",

    "@xcite and paper i are reported in table [ known ] , together with the new results @xmath362 , @xmath363 and @xmath364 , @xmath365 of the present work .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      our best fit can be visualized in fig .",

    "observe in particular the smooth convergence of the successive pn approximations towards the exact sf results .",
    "note , though , that there is still a small separation between the 7pn curve and the exact data in the very relativistic regime shown at the extreme left of fig .",
    "[ ut_sf ] .",
    "we have found that our data in the limited range of @xmath368 can be extremely well characterized by a fit with five appropriately chosen ( basis ) functions",
    ". that is , the coefficients in table [ bestfit ] are well determined , with small uncertainties , and small changes in the actual details of the fit result in coefficients lying within their error estimates .",
    "fewer coefficients would result in a very poor characterization of the same data while more coefficients result in large uncertainties in the estimated coefficients , which themselves become overly sensitive to small changes in specific details ( such as the actual choice of points to be fitted ) . in practice , over the data range we finally choose , and with the five coefficients we fit for , we end up with exceedingly good results for the estimated coefficients , and with residuals which sink to the level of our noise .",
    "we have a very high quality fit which is quite insensitive to minor details . nevertheless , as tables [ analytic ] and [ numerical ] hint , error estimates for these highest order coefficients should be regarded with an appropriate degree of caution .",

    "the logarithms come from expanding the retardation @xmath172 in the source when @xmath375 , integrating each of the terms using the formulas  , and finally taking the finite part ( fp ) associated with the poles @xmath376 .",
    "our compact formula gives the result of all these operations as @xmath377 where @xmath378 denotes the @xmath379-th time anti - derivative of the function @xmath372 .",
    "by @xmath380 we mean the contribution of logarithms in @xmath381 ; thus all the other terms in @xmath381 besides @xmath380 admit an expansion when @xmath68 in simple powers of @xmath70 without logarithms . note that the factor of the logarithm in eq .   is a multipolar antisymmetric homogeneous solution of the wave equation which is regular at the origin , when @xmath68 .",

    "[ secii ] that the fz logarithms start to arise at the cubic @xmath99 non linear iteration , and that they do not contribute to the conservative part of the dynamics of compact binaries .",

    "namely , if we define @xmath380 to be non - stf in @xmath46 , i.e. having @xmath384 in place of the stf product @xmath81 in , then we can easily prove that the log - terms are given by with @xmath385 in place of the stf product @xmath386 .",
    "of course all the other terms will be different , but the structure of the log - terms will be the same . then it is trivial to show that the formula applies as well to a product of minkowskian outgoing null vectors @xmath178 representing the direction of propagation of gravitational waves , and satisfying @xmath387 . considering @xmath388 \\,,\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath389 , we find indeed that the contribution of logarithms in the near - zone expansion of this object is given by @xmath390 we use this result to show that a family of logarithms not considered in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] is actually pure gauge .",
    "we showed there that all the 4pn and 5pn near - zone logarithms come from iterating the leading - order @xmath175 part of the quadratic source , namely @xmath177 .",
    "however we computed only the first term @xmath391 , which is associated with tails , but we left out the second term @xmath180 .",
    "now thanks to the structure @xmath180 the logarithms appear in the form of a gauge transformation and will never contribute to a gauge invariant result .",
    "this was already shown at the level of the dominant 4pn log - term in @xcite . by expanding @xmath318 on the basis of stf tensors",
    "@xmath81 ( or rather @xmath392 ) we need only to prove this for each of the individual multipolar pieces in the source which have the structure @xmath393 \\,.\\ ] ] applying the logarithms are given by @xmath394 and can readily be put in the form of a gauge transformation with gauge vector @xmath395 indeed we have @xmath396 modulo some terms which are free of logarithms . therefore the `` seed '' logarithms generated in this way at quadratic order can be removed by a gauge transformation , and we conclude that the whole family of logarithms coming from the iteration at cubic and higher orders can be removed by a non - linear deformation of the gauge transformation , namely by a coordinate transformation .",
