    "[ thm : oddneighb ] if a triangulation of the @xmath3-sphere has exactly two vertices of odd degree , then these vertices are not adjacent .",
    "this statement looks quite surprising . indeed , from a double counting argument we know that every graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree .",
    "of course , there exist abstract graphs with exactly two odd vertices , which are adjacent .",
    "there also exist triangulated spheres with two non - adjacent vertices of odd degree , or with four pairwise adjacent odd vertices , see figure [ fig : oddvert ] . but nothing can bring together two single odd vertices .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : oddneighb ] given in @xcite is a straightforward combination of a lemma from @xcite with the four - color theorem ( whose proof appeared in the time between @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the proofs presented in this article are much simpler ; one of them uses the `` even obstruction map '' introduced by fisk in @xcite .",
    "we prefer to use a different term `` coloring monodromy '' .    by using a generalization ( also due to fisk @xcite ) of the coloring monodromy , we prove the following generalization of theorem [ thm : oddneighb ] .",
    "[ thm : kvert ] let @xmath0 be a positive integer .",
    "if a triangulation of the @xmath3-sphere has exactly two vertices whose degrees are not divisible by @xmath0 , then these vertices are not adjacent .",
    "the case @xmath4 is trivial : the sum of the vertex degrees of a triangulated sphere with @xmath5 vertices equals @xmath6 , and having all but two vertex degrees multiples of @xmath0 would lead to a larger sum .",
    "thus only the cases @xmath7 are of interest .",
    "theorem [ thm : oddneighb ] implies the non - planarity of every graph on @xmath5 vertices with @xmath8 edges and with exactly two vertices of odd degree , which are adjacent .",
    "however , the simplest such graphs are just vertex - splittings of @xmath9 .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : colpol ] an elementary proof of theorem [ thm : oddneighb ] is given .",
    "it uses vertex colorings of even triangulations of simply - connected surfaces . in section [ sec:3col ]",
    "we define the _ coloring monodromy _ which provides a more formal framework , suitable for generalizations .",
    "one of these is the _ platonic monodromy _ , which leads to a proof of theorem [ thm : kvert ] in section [ sec : platmon ] .",
    "section [ sec : brcov ] contains further developments of the notions introduced in section [ sec : colmon ] .",
    "we discuss the branched covers defined by the coloring monodromies , mention a relation to the belyi surfaces , and give a geometric version of the proof of theorem [ thm : kvert ] , based this time on the developing map of a spherical cone - surface on the sphere .",
    "assume we succeeded to find a triangulation of the sphere with exactly two odd degree vertices , which are neighbors .",
    "remove the edge joining the odd vertices , together with the two triangles on both sides of it .",
    "we obtain a triangulation of a sphere with a quadrangular hole , where all vertices , interior as well as those on the boundary , are of even degree . by stretching it to the plane",
    ", we obtain a triangulation of the square .",
    "thus it suffices to show that there is no triangulation of the square with all vertices of even degree .",
    "let us study a more general problem : _ for which @xmath5 can an @xmath5-gon be triangulated with all vertices of even degrees ?",
    "_ one tries in vain to do this with the quadrilateral and the pentagon , finds an even triangulation for a hexagon , and comes up with a construction that produces an even triangulation of an @xmath10-gon from one for an @xmath5-gon , see figure [ fig : ngoneven ] .",
    "[ thm : colorpolygon ] there is a triangulation of an @xmath5-gon ( vertices in the interior allowed , vertices on the sides forbidden ) with all vertices of even degree if and only if @xmath5 is divisible by @xmath11 .",
    "it is a part of folklore that the vertices of an even triangulation of an @xmath5-gon can be properly colored in three colors .",
    "indeed , a coloring of a triangle induces colorings of all adjacent triangles .",
    "thus we have little choice but to color one of the triangles and extend this coloring along all sequences of triangles where consecutive triangles share an edge .",
    "extensions along different paths ending at the same triangle will agree because the degrees of all interior vertices are even : sliding a path over a vertex of even degree does not change the colors at its terminal triangle .",
    "now look at the colors assigned to the corners of the @xmath5-gon . since all boundary vertices have even degrees , the colors on the boundary repeat cyclically @xmath12 .",
    "it follows that @xmath5 is divisible by @xmath11 .    to triangulate @xmath5-gons for @xmath5 divisible by @xmath11 , use the inductive construction shown on figure [ fig : ngoneven ]",
    "let @xmath13 be a triangulation of a surface , possibly with boundary .",
    "try to color in three colors the vertices of @xmath13 so that neighbors have different colors .",
    "as in the proof of theorem [ thm : colorpolygon ] , we can start by coloring the vertices of an arbitrary triangle and extend the coloring along every sequence of triangles where consecutive triangles share an edge . in general",
    ", the coloring of the last triangle depends on the choice of a sequence .",
    "two homotopic sequences induce the same coloring if the homotopy does nt pass through vertices of odd degree .",
    "in particular , we can consider only closed paths starting and ending at a triangle @xmath14 and look how the extension along these paths permutes the colors .",
    "[ dfn : colmon ] let @xmath13 be a triangulation of a surface , possibly with boundary , and let @xmath15 be all interior vertices of odd degree . pick a triangle @xmath16 and fix a _ coloring _ of its vertices , that is a bijection between its vertex set and the set @xmath17 .",
    "the group homomorphism @xmath18 that maps every path to the associated recoloring of the vertices of @xmath14 is called the _",
    "coloring monodromy_.    more generally , the coloring monodromy of a triangulated @xmath19-dimensional manifold is a homomorphism @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the odd locus of the triangulation , see section [ sec : highdim ] .",
    "clearly , a triangulation is vertex - colorable if and only if its coloring monodromy is trivial .",
    "the coloring monodromy was introduced in @xcite ( the even obstruction map ) and rediscovered in @xcite ( the group of projectivities ) .",
    "assume we have a triangulation of the sphere with two adjacent odd degree vertices @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath16 be one of the triangles containing @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; color the vertices @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the colors @xmath24 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "then the path going around @xmath22 exchanges the colors @xmath3 and @xmath11 , and the path around @xmath23 exchanges @xmath24 and @xmath11 .",
    "it follows that the image of the coloring monodromy @xmath25 is the whole group @xmath26 . on the other hand , @xmath27 .",
    "since there is no epimorphism from the group @xmath28 onto @xmath26 , there is no triangulation with the assumed properties .",
    "note that the torus and the projective plane can be triangulated with two adjacent odd vertices , see figure [ fig : torprojodd ] .",
    "the above proof of theorem [ thm : oddneighb ] gives a reason why this can happen : the fundamental groups of doubly punctured torus or projective plane is large enough to allow an epimorphism onto @xmath26 .",
    "the above arguments were based on the observation that a simply connected triangulated surface with all vertices of even degrees has a proper vertex coloring in three colors . for theorem [ thm : kvert ]",
    "we need a new notion of a proper coloring adapted to the case when all vertex degrees are divisible by @xmath0 , for @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the boundary complex of the tetrahedron , octahedron , or icosahedron for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the vertices of @xmath29 will be our colors ; that is , a coloring of @xmath13 associates to each vertex of @xmath13 a vertex of @xmath29 . a coloring of @xmath13 is called _ proper _ , if the following two conditions are satisfied .    1",
    ".   the vertices of any triangle of @xmath13 are bijectively colored by the vertices of some triangle of @xmath29 .",
    "the vertices of any two adjacent triangles of @xmath13 are bijectively colored by the vertices of some two adjacent triangles of @xmath29 .",
    "the properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ensure that a coloring of a base triangle @xmath16 can be uniquely extended along a path of adjacent triangles .",
    "if the surface is simply - connected and all of its interior vertices have degrees divisible by @xmath0 , then extensions along different paths agree , and we obtain a proper coloring of the whole surface .    in general , going along a closed path results in a recoloring of the vertices of the initial triangle : starting with @xmath33 we end up with @xmath34 .",
    "the composition @xmath35 has a unique extension to an automorphism of the regular polyhedron @xmath29 .",
    "( the automorphism group of @xmath29 is flag - transitive . )    thus , similarly to definition [ dfn : colmon ] we have the following construction , which is due to fisk ( * ? ? ? * section i.5 ) .",
    "let @xmath36 , and let @xmath29 be the boundary complex of the tetrahedron , octahedron , or icosahedron , respectively .",

    "pick a triangle @xmath16 of @xmath13 and fix a _ coloring _ of its vertices , that is a bijection between its vertex set and the vertex set of some triangle of @xmath29 .",
    "the group homomorphism @xmath37 that maps every path to the automorphism of @xmath29 associated with the recoloring of the vertices of @xmath38 is called the _",
    "platonic monodromy_.    intuitively , the platonic monodromy arises from `` rolling '' the platonic solid @xmath29 over the simplicial surface @xmath13 .",
    "assume we have a triangulation of the sphere with two adjacent vertices @xmath22 and @xmath23 whose degrees are not divisible by @xmath0 , the degrees of all other vertices being multiples of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath16 be one of the triangles containing @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then the two closed paths , one going around @xmath22 and the other going around @xmath23 generate two non - commuting automorphisms of @xmath29 .",
    "hence the image of the @xmath29-coloring monodromy is a non - abelian group . on the other hand , since @xmath39",
    ", the image must be a cyclic group .",
    "the contradiction shows that such a triangulation does nt exist .",
    "theorem [ thm : kvert ] can be strengthened : for @xmath40 the two exceptional vertices not only ca nt be adjacent , but also ca nt lie across an edge .",
    "more generally , rolling @xmath29 from one exceptional vertex to the other must color the second vertex in the color of the first .",
    "the case @xmath41 can be described as coloring vertices of @xmath13 in @xmath31 colors so that both the neighbors and the vertices lying across an edge have different colors . for @xmath42 one",
    "colors the vertices in @xmath43 colors imitating the numbers on the dice : the colors at the vertices lying across an edge must add up to @xmath44 .",
    "for @xmath45 a special arrangement of @xmath46 colors is used , which is not so easy to describe explicitely .",
    "the coloring monodromy ( definition [ dfn : colmon ] ) not only detects whether a triangulation is vertex - colorable , but also allows to associate with every non - colorable triangulation a colorable branched cover .",
    "namely , assume that some closed path forces us to recolor the vertices of a triangle .",
    "then , instead of changing the colors , start a new layer of triangles",
    ". see figure [ fig : brcov ] for an illustration .",
    "applying this procedure to all paths produces a branched cover over the triangulated surface , ramified over the vertices of odd degree .",
    "it was introduced in @xcite .",
    "[ dfn : unfold ] let @xmath13 be a triangulation of a surface @xmath47 . consider the set of colored triangles of @xmath13 : @xmath48 if two triangles @xmath49 and @xmath50 share an edge @xmath51 , and the colorings @xmath52 and @xmath53 agree on @xmath51 , then glue @xmath54 to @xmath55 along @xmath51 . the resulting simplicial complex @xmath56 is called the _ unfolding _ of @xmath13 .    there is a canonical projection @xmath57 .",
    "if the unfolding is disconnected , then all of its components are isomorphic to each other .",
    "the unfolding of the boundary of the simplex is a triangulation of the torus .",
    "the projection @xmath57 is a six - fold branched cover , where every vertex has three preimages of index @xmath3 .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",

    "if all vertices of @xmath13 have even degree , then @xmath57 is a usual ( non - branched ) covering , which is non - trivial if and only if there is a homotopically non - trivial loop that permutes the colors .    in the @xmath44-vertex triangulation of the torus all vertices have degree @xmath43 .",
    "generators of the fundamental group recolor the vertices of a triangle in a cyclic way , see figure [ fig:7torus ] .",
    "therefore the unfolding is a vertex - colorable triangulation on 21 vertices triply covering the @xmath44-vertex triangulation .",
    "-vertex torus triangulation . ]",
    "every even triangulation of the torus is either vertex - colorable or can be cut along a simple closed curve so that to become vertex - colorable .",
    "it suffices to find a primitive element of @xmath58 with the trivial coloring monodromy .",
    "there is at least one such among @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a basis of @xmath61 .",

    "subdivide @xmath62 in two triangles with vertices @xmath63 and color one of the triangles white and the other black .",
    "this induces a triangulation of @xmath47 with the vertices colored with @xmath64 , @xmath24 , and @xmath65 , and the triangles colored white and black . for more details",

    "vice versa , if a vertex - colored triangulation is oriented , then we can color every triangle with orientation @xmath66 white and every triangle with orientation @xmath67 black .    for the second part , color the faces of the unfolding @xmath68 .",
    "the assumption on the monodromy implies that the faces of @xmath68 with the same image in @xmath13 have the same color .",
