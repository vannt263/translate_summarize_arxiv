    "liquid xenon ( lxe ) detectors are currently a favored choice for rare event search experiments , from dark matter direct detection to neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the xenon100 dark matter experiment  @xcite@xcite uses 242 hamamatsu r8520 - 06-al photomultiplier tubes ( pmts )  @xcite to detect the scintillation light produced by weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) as they scatter off xe nuclei .",
    "these compact metal - channel pmts were specifically designed to work at 177 k , close to the temperature of lxe , and at a pressure up to 5 atm .",
    "they have a quartz window and a bialkali photocathode , for high sensitivity and low dark current in the uv regime @xcite .",
    "recently , a new version of the same pmt ( r8520 - 406 ) with improved sensitivity at 178 nm , the scintillation wavelength of lxe , was produced by hamamatsu and procured for an upgrade of the xenon100 experiment .",
    "the quantum efficiency ( qe ) is one of the most important characteristics of a pmt .",
    "the qe is defined as the ratio between the number of photoelectrons emitted from the photocathode and the number of incident photons .",
    "the energy absorbed from the incident photons is transferred to the valence band of the photocathode .",
    "since the photoemission process has a probabilistic nature , not all of the electrons that absorb energy from the incident photons are emitted as photoelectrons  @xcite .    a quantity related to",
    "the qe is the radiant sensitivity ( @xmath1 ) , used to express the spectral characteristics and especially the relationship between the photocathode response and the incident light wavelength .",
    "the radiant sensitivity is defined as the photoelectric current generated by the photocathode , i@xmath2 , divided by the incident radiant flux at a given wavelength , l@xmath3 :    @xmath4    the relationship between the qe and the @xmath1 is given by  @xcite    @xmath5\\\\ \\label{qe_sk}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is planck s constant , @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath8 is the wavelength of the incident light in nm , @xmath9 is the electron charge , and @xmath1 is the radiant sensitivity in a / w .",
    "the radiant sensitivity is often provided by the manufacturer for each pmt . more generally , the blue sensitivity index ( sometimes called cathode blue sensitivity ) , @xmath10 , which is the photoelectric current generated from the photocathode with a blue filter interposed in the same setup , is specified .",
    "however , this value is usually measured only at room temperature .",
    "hence , a quantitative study of the qe as a function of temperature is necessary for an improved understanding of lxe experiments .",
    "a schematic of the setup is shown in figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "it consists of a deuterium lamp and two independent vacuum chambers .",
    "the first chamber contains a monochromator used to select a narrow wavelength range from the spectrum of the deuterium lamp .",
    "the second chamber hosts the pmt being tested .",
    "cold trap ( cryopump ) and the turbo pump system were installed to reduce the water level at different temperatures and pressures inside the vacuum chamber.,width=340 ]    a deuterium lamp ( mcpherson , model 632 ) emits light between 115 nm and 400 nm and is particularly useful for measurements in the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) and deep uv .",
    "the output spectrum between 380  nm and 165  nm is continuous  @xcite .",
    "below 165  nm , molecular lines predominate .",
    "the light emitted from the lamp is transmitted by a mgf@xmath11 window and passes through an entrance slit into a vacuum monochromator ( mcpherson , model 218 ) where a narrow wavelength range from the lamp is selected .",
    "the monochromator is composed of a snap - in diffraction grating that is optimized for wavelengths between 150  nm and 300  nm , and two al+mgf@xmath11 coated mirrors that have a reflectivity of @xmath1275% at 178  nm  @xcite .",
    "the diffraction grating can be remotely adjusted with a stepper motor control unit .",
    "after the monochromator , the light with the selected wavelength propagates through an exit slit to the next vacuum chamber .",
    "the size of both the entrance and the exit slits can be adjusted from 10  @xmath13 m to 2  mm in order to modify the flux of the beam and the reciprocal linear dispersion . for this work ,",
    "the size of both slits was set to 2  mm . the mgf@xmath11 window that separates the monochromator and the vacuum chamber has an optical transmissivity of @xmath1280%  @xcite for light with a wavelength of 178 nm .",
    "independent vacuum pumping stations are used to prevent impurities from the monochromator side , such as oil from the stepper motor , from reducing the optical transparency of the pmt window .",
    "a pfeiffer hicube 80 eco pumping station on the monochromator and a pfeiffer tmu071p turbomolecular pump with a dry backing pump on the second vacuum chamber keep the pressure at about 1.5@xmath1410@xmath15  mbar and below 10@xmath16  mbar , respectively .",
    "the vacuum chamber is equipped with a motion feedthrough that allows for linear motion in three dimensions as well as rotation .",
    "the photodetector  either a pmt or a photodiode for calibration purposes  is mounted on this rotator , which can in addition be translated in both the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "a customized collimator is installed on the port of the vacuum chamber where the light goes through .",
    "this reduces the size of the beam to @xmath171 cm and allows for more controlled and parallel beam shining on the photodetector .    to cool down the pmt from room temperature to a value close to that of lxe ( @xmath12165 k ) , an iwatani pdc08 pulse tube refrigerator ( ptr )",
    "is coupled to the vacuum chamber .",
    "two copper braids are connected to the ptr and attached to each side of a copper box , which is in direct contact with the case of the pmt .",
    "one of two pt100 thermometers is mounted on an aluminum piece that supports the pmt as can be seen in top of figure  [ pmt_cooling ] .",
    "another pt100 is attached to the pmt wall , allowing a direct measurement of the pmt temperature ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the case of the pmt is connected to a positive voltage while the pmt base is at the negative voltage . for electrical insulation of the pmt due to the polarity used in the pmt base ,",
    "the pmt was wrapped around with ptfe tape that also helped hold the pt100 in place .",
    "the signal of the pt100 is fed into a customized labview program and used for a pid control system that regulates the temperature , via resistive heating of 6.2 v zener diodes .",
    "the pressure inside the chamber is kept below 10@xmath16 mbar for the duration of all measurements .",
    "an ortec hv supply provides the high voltage on the pmt .",
    "a modified voltage divider allows a fixed voltage difference to be set between the photocathode and the first dynode in the recommended linearity range between 50 and 300  v  @xcite .",
    "the current from the photodetectors is measured by a keithley 6485 picoammeter with a precision of 0.01  pa .",
    "individual measurements of the current , each set to take 1 second , are stored by a dedicated routine provided by keithley .",
    "for each temperature setting , 100 measurements are taken consecutively within 2 minutes and are used to determine the mean of the photocurrent and its fluctuations .",
    "the four pmts used in the measurements are hamamatsu r8520 - 406 with bialkali photocathodes and dimensions of 25.7 @xmath14 25.7 @xmath14 28.2 mm@xmath18 , with an effective photocathode area of 20.5 @xmath14 20.5 mm@xmath19 .",
    "the qe and the sk@xmath20 at room temperature was provided by the manufacturer for each of these pmts .",
    "the average qe value is @xmath1231% at 178 nm xe scintillation light  @xcite .",
    "table  [ table_pmt ] shows some specifications of this pmt .",
    ".specifications of r8520 - 406 pmts provided by hamamatsu . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table_qe ]      to measure the qe of the pmt as a function of temperature , the pmt casing is cooled down with the ptr .",
    "the temperature is kept at its set point by heating with the zener diode .",
    "since the geometry inside the chamber remains unchanged , the amount of light incident on the pmt window stays the same and the qe at low temperature can be inferred from the room temperature measurement according to :    @xmath21    thus , no further comparison to the photodiode is necessary .",
    "current measurements were performed from room temperature down to 160 k , the lowest operation temperature of the pmts , as indicated by the manufacturer .",
    "figure  [ relative ] shows the ratio between the qe at low and room temperature for the four pmts studied , as a function of temperature .",
    "note that the room temperatures for each pmt are slightly different , as shown by the rightmost points in each curve , thus shifting the reference point for each .",
    "for all the pmts , the sensitivity increases up to @xmath1210% at the lowest temperature that was measured .",
    "no hysteresis effect was observed while warming back up to room temperature in any of these measurements .",
    "the uncertainties reflect the standard deviation values of 100 current measurements at each temperature .",
    "the larger error bars for pmt lv1013 are due to electronic noise from running the turbo pump during that measurement .",
    "we have designed a system to measure the qe of r8520 - 406 pmts , which have special bialkali photocathodes capable of providing a good performance at temperatures down to 160  k. four pmts were measured with this setup .",
    "their absolute qes at room temperature were measured by comparing their response to that of a calibrated photodiode , and the values obtained match those quoted by the manufacturer within the uncertainties .",
    "the qe of the pmts was also measured for temperatures down to 160 k , the temperature of lxe at which these pmts are usually operated .",
    "a relative increase at low temperatures of up to @xmath1210% is measured for all four pmts .",
    "this constitutes an important measurement for detectors based on lxe scintillation since it will help to more accurately determine the number of photons observed from the number of photoelectrons detected .",
    "the setup can be adopted to enable testing of other types of pmts being considered for next generation experiments based on liquid noble elements .",
    "this work was carried out with support from the national science foundation and from a start - up grant of the university of mnster .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the help from nist and from robert e. vest , in particular for valuable advice and the opportunity to use one of their photodiodes .",
