    "experimental data @xcite show an abundance of scalar meson resonances both in the non - strange and in the strange sectors .",
    "in particular the kaons and other mesons containing strange quarks are expected to play an important role in vacuum phenomenology as well as in the restoration of the @xmath5 chiral symmetry @xcite , a feature of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) broken in vacuum spontaneously @xcite by the quark condensate and explicitly by non - vanishing quark masses ( @xmath6 denotes the number of quark flavours ) .",
    "meson phenomenology in the non - strange and strange sectors has been considered in various sigma model approaches ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in this paper , we present an extended linear sigma model ( elsm @xcite ) where these approaches are generalised to contain scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons both in the non - strange and strange sectors . in particular , we devote attention to the structure of scalar mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in ref .",

    "@xcite contained no strange mesons and in this paper we address the question whether the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding @xmath7  as a predominantly @xmath11 state also holds in a more general @xmath12 approach that simultaneously allows for a statement regarding the structure of @xmath8 ( which we find to be predominantly of @xmath13 nature ) .",

    "the reason is that the chiral - anomaly term now present in our lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) influences , as one would expect , only the phenomenology of the pseudoscalar singlets ( , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , whereas the t hooft form of the chiral - anomaly term influences the phenomenology of other mesons ( such as , , the @xmath35 states ) as well @xcite . in the non - strange sector , we assign the fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the pion and the @xmath38 counterpart of the @xmath33 meson , @xmath39 .",
    "the fields @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are assigned to the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 mesons , respectively @xcite . in the strange sector",

    "the assignment of the scalar states in our model to physical resonances is ambiguous . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , we assign the @xmath58 field to @xmath59 and , consequently , @xmath60 to the physical @xmath61 state .",
    "this , of course , presupposes that these two states above 1 gev are @xmath9 states ( as all the fields present in our model are @xmath9  states @xcite ) and thus one needs to determine whether such an assignment allows for a global fit with a correct description of meson phenomenology to be found .",
    "additionally , the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) contains two isoscalar @xmath62 states , @xmath63 \\{pure non - strange state , @xmath64 @xcite } and @xmath65 ( pure strange state , @xmath66 ) .  as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , we observe mixing of @xmath63 and @xmath65 in the lagrangian leading to the emergence of two new states , @xmath67 ( predominantly non - strange ) and @xmath68 ( predominantly strange ) .",
    "the next section describes results regarding the masses and the two - pion decay widths of the @xmath69 states that allow for an assignment of the @xmath69 states to physical resonances .    in order to implement spontaneous symmetry breaking in the model",
    ", we shift @xmath70 and @xmath71 by their respective vacuum expectation values @xmath72  and @xmath73 . mixing terms containing axial - vectors and pseudoscalars and @xmath74 and @xmath60",
    "then arise and are removed as described in ref .",
    "consequently , renormalisation coefficients are introduced for the pseudoscalar fields and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "we note the following formulas for @xmath75 ( renormalisation coefficient of the pion ) and @xmath76 ( renormalisation coefficient of the kaon ) : @xmath77 paper1 and analogously @xmath78 , where @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 mev are , respectively , pion and kaon decay constants @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) contains 14 parameters : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "the parameter @xmath91 is determined from the decay width @xmath95 @xcite ; we set @xmath96 in accordance with large-@xmath97  deliberations paper1 and also @xmath98 because the explicit symmetry breaking is small in the non - strange sector .",
    "all other parameters are calculated from a global fit of masses including @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we also use the full decay width of @xmath59 @xcite in the fit to further constrain the parameters [ @xmath111 mev ] .",
    "note , however , that the mass terms from the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] )  used in the fit allow only for the linear combination @xmath112 rather than the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath81 by themselves to be determined @xcite .",
    ".masses from our global fit . the value of @xmath113 is larger than the pdg value due to the pattern of explicit symmetry breaking that in our model makes strange mesons approximately 100 mev ( @xmath114 strange - quark mass ) heavier than non - strange mesons .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath115 is under investigation @xcite .",
    "all other values correspond very well to experimental data .",
    "note that the fit also yields @xmath116 mev @xmath117 .",

    "is implemented analogously to the quarkonium - glueball mixing of ref .",
    "stani . in our case ,",
    "two mixed states emerge : @xmath118 ( 95% non - strange , 5% strange ) and @xmath68 ( 95% strange , 5% non - strange ) .",
    "their masses and decay widths depend on seven parameters ( @xmath89 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) .",
    "the decay widths @xmath123 depend on the parameters @xmath124  and @xmath81  separately rather than on the linear combination @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , using the value of the linear combination @xmath125 obtained from the fit allows us to substitute @xmath81 by @xmath89 in the formulas for @xmath126 .",
    "varying @xmath89 and consequently @xmath127 and @xmath128 leads to diagrams for the decay widths shown in fig .",
    "( [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "( note that @xmath129 is required for the spontaneous symmetry breaking to be implemented correctly in the model . )",
    "there is a very good correspondence of our predominantly non - strange state @xmath130 with @xmath7 as experimental data @xcite  regarding the latter state read @xmath131  mev and @xmath132  mev with a dominant two - pion decay channel .",
    "the state @xmath68 corresponds well to @xmath133 : experimental data regarding this resonance read @xmath134 mev which leads to @xmath135 mev and @xmath136  mev ; @xmath128 is very close to @xmath137 mev .",
    "we thus conslude that both resonances @xmath138 and @xmath8 are predominantly quarkonia : the former 95% @xmath139  and the latter 95% @xmath13 .  using @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    "it is possible to calculate the corresponding two values of @xmath89 and then we obtain @xmath142 mev , @xmath143 mev and @xmath144 mev , @xmath145 mev .",
    "both sets of values are within pdg data .",
    "we have presented a @xmath12 linear sigma model with ( axial-)vector mesons .",
    "the model contains two isoscalar @xmath62states : the pure @xmath146 state @xmath63 and the pure @xmath147 state @xmath71 .",
    "mixing of the pure states originates a predominantly non - strange state @xmath118 and a predominantly strange state @xmath68 . in order to assign the latter states to experimentally measured ones",
    ", we have calculated their masses and decay widths .",
    "we have determined the model parameters by using a global fit of meson masses ( except the sigma masses ) and the total decay width of @xmath59 .",
    "our results regarding the masses and decay widths of @xmath69 lead to conclusion that @xmath118 corresponds to @xmath7 and that @xmath148 corresponds to @xmath8 .",
    "conversely , the results imply that @xmath138 is a predominantly @xmath146 state and that @xmath8 is a predominantly @xmath13 state",
    ". however , one still needs to calculate other decay widths from the @xmath149 sector and verify whether a fit with reasonable phenomenology can be found with assumption of scalar quarkonia in the region under 1 gev @xcite .",
