    "there is a quite large number of studies about opinion formation in uniform societies  @xcite .",
    "many such models adopt an approach similar to that of the ising model . in such cases",
    "one has two opinions , say a and b or -1 and 1 , and one is interested in the establishment of a majority ( magnetic phase transitions ) or in the effects of borders , or in the influence of some leader ( social impact theory )  @xcite .",
    "this opinion space can be seen as the first ingredient of these models .",
    "the second ingredient is how to model the response to an external influence .",
    "it is common to classify the attitude of people ( agents ) as either conformist or contrarian ( also known as nonconformist ) .",
    "a conformist tends to agree with his neighbours and a contrarian to disagree .",
    "it is also easy to map this attitude onto ising terms : conformist agents correspond to ferromagnetic coupling and contrarians to antiferromagnetic ones  @xcite .",
    "the effects due to the presence of contrarian agents in a society have been studied in models related to the voter model  @xcite .",
    "however , individuals that are under a strong social pressure tend to agree with the great majority even when they are certain that the majority s opinion is wrong , as shown by asch  @xcite . under a strong social pressure a contrarian may agree with a large majority , an phenomenon that may be modelled using non - linear interactions",
    ".    the strategy of following an overwhelming majority may be ecological , since it is probable that this coherent behaviour is due to some unknown piece of information , and in any case the competitive loss is minimal since it equally affects all other agents .",
    "the third ingredient is the connectivity , i.e. , how the neighbourhood of a given individual is composed .",
    "traditionally , magnetic systems have been studied either on regular lattices , trees or with random connections , whose behaviour is similar to that of the mean - field approach . in recent years",
    ", much attention has been devoted to other network topologies , and so researchers have studied the ising model on several kind of networks , from small - world  @xcite to scale - free  @xcite etc .",
    "@xcite .    with respect to the standard ising model , in the study of opinion formation",
    "there is no compulsory obligation to have symmetric interactions : a conformist may be influenced by a contrarian behavior ( for instance imitating hipsters  @xcite ) .",
    "the response character becomes a site variable , that may be different from individual to individual . in these terms",
    ", the simple ferromagnetic ising model represents a uniform society of conformists with local symmetric interactions .",
    "the fourth ingredient is the update scheduling , that may be completely asynchronous , like in standard monte carlo simulations , or completely parallel , like in cellular automata , or something in the middle  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear which scheme is the most representative of reality .",
    "real human interactions are indeed continuous , but also clocked by days , elections , etc .",
    "an effect that is favoured by parallelism is synchronization in the presence of complex dynamics . as happens in physics , a macroscopic irregular behaviour ( macroscopic chaos ) implies a coherent , although irregular motion of many elements ( the microscopic constituents ) .",
    "one of most intriguing effects is the hipster s one , in which a society of contrarians tends to behave in a uniform way  @xcite . clearly , `` conformistic hipsters '' always change their behaviour , when they realize to be still in the mainstream , but since they do so all together , they remain synchronized : the parallelism is a crucial element of such a behaviour .",
    "finally , the fifth ingredient is homogeneity .",
    "there are many possibility of introducing mixtures of individuals or spins with different coupling .",
    "we investigate what happens when one mixes ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , and we shall show that this mixture promotes a `` bubbling '' behaviour in the bifurcation , meaning that the bifurcation appears first for intermediate values of the parameters , similar to what happens with asynchronism .    in previous works  @xcite ,",
    "we studied the behaviour of `` nonlinear '' contrarians denoting them with the term `` reasonable contrarian '' .",
    "we studied the collective behaviour of a society composed either by only reasonable contrarian agents , or by a mixture of contrarians and conformists .",
    "the rationale was that in some cases , and in particular in the presence of frustrated situations like in minority games  @xcite , it is not convenient to always follow the majority , since in this case one is always on the `` losing side '' of the market .",
    "this is one of the main reasons for the emergence of a contrarian attitude . on the other hand ,",
    "if all or almost all agents in a market take the same decision , it is often wise to follow such a trend .",
    "we can denote such a situation with the word `` social norm '' .    a society composed by a strong majority of reasonable contrarians exhibits interesting behaviours when changing the topology of the connections .",
    "on a one - dimensional regular lattice , there is no long - range order , the evolution is disordered and the average opinion is always halfway between the extreme values  @xcite .",
    "however , adding long - range connections or rewiring existing ones , we observe the watts - strogatz `` small - world '' effect , with a transition towards a mean - field behaviour .",
    "but since in this case the mean - field equation is , for a suitable choice of parameters , chaotic , we observe the emergence of coherent oscillations , with a bifurcation cascade eventually leading to a chaotic - like behaviour of the average opinion .",
    "the small - world transition is essentially a synchronization effect .",
    "similar effects with a bifurcation diagram resembling that of the logistic map have been observed in a different model of `` adapt if novel - drop if ubiquitous '' behaviour , upon changing the connectivity  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present study is that of reformulating this problem in terms of a parallel , nonlinear ising model both on a regular lattice where the spin at any site is influenced buy its nearest neighbors and on small world networks . in the first case the mean field behavior of the magnetization",
    "is described by a nonlinear equation for which chaos can be evaluated by the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 . in the second one ,",
    "the evolution is stochastic but we measure disorder using boltzmann s entropy @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "entropy can also be used as a measure of chaos in the study of the nonlinear mean field equation .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following .",
    "we discuss the `` nonlinear '' parallel ising model in section  [ sec : parallelising ] .",
    "we can therefore introduce the mean - field approximation of the model in section  [ sec : meanfield ] , showing the bifurcation phase diagrams as a function of the parameters .",
    "the the definition of the entropy and the results of microscopic simulations @xmath1 are reported in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
