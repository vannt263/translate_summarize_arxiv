    "<S> in a smooth dynamical system , a homoclinic connection is a closed orbit returning to a saddle equilibrium . under perturbation , homoclinics are associated with bifurcations of periodic orbits , and with chaos in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> homoclinic connections in nonsmooth systems are complicated by their interaction with discontinuities in their vector fields . </S>",
    "<S> a connection may involve a regular saddle outside a discontinuity set , or a pseudo - saddle on a discontinuity set , with segments of the connection allowed to cross or slide along the discontinuity . </S>",
    "<S> even the simplest case , that of connection to a regular saddle that hits a discontinuity as a parameter is varied , is surprisingly complex . </S>",
    "<S> bifurcation diagrams are presented here for non - resonant saddles in the plane , including an example in a forced pendulum . </S>"
