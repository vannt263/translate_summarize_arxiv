    "microcavity embedded semiconductor nanostructures have been subject of intense studies during recent years . due to the high density of the photon field inside a microcavity",
    "these structures feature exceptionally strong light - matter coupling  @xcite .",
    "the effects of strong coupling might be applied for realization of low - threshold lasers  @xcite , logic elements for optical computers  @xcite , memory elements for quantum computations  @xcite , sources of terahertz emission  @xcite , etc .",
    "the light - matter coupling is the most efficient at the resonance between cavity mode and the exciton transitions inside the cavity .",
    "this resonance results in formation of coupled photon - exciton excitations ",
    "exciton - polaritons .",
    "the polariton effect might be observed in various excitonic systems  @xcite , however it is most pronounced in the microcavity structures . in high - finesse microcavities",
    "the energy of exciton - photon interaction is enhanced by about three order of magnitude as compared to bulk semiconductor materials and thin films .",
    "exciton - photon coupling in microcavities leads to formation of lower ( lp ) and upper ( up ) polariton modes , which are split by @xmath0  mev in typical gaas based samples .",
    "excitation of both polariton modes with a short optical pulse leads to oscillations of exciton polarization and electric field amplitudes at the frequency defined by the value of the splitting between polariton modes ( the so - called , vacuum rabi oscillations )  @xcite .",
    "the study of rabi oscillations allows for a detailed understanding of polariton dynamics in microcavity structures  @xcite . since the typical values of rabi oscillation period lie in a pico- or sub picosecond range , the most effective way to study the rabi oscillations",
    "is to apply the methods of coherent spectroscopy with femtosecond laser pulses .",
    "these methods , generally called pump - probe , are based on probing with a probe pulse the changes in medium properties induced by a pump pulse , and have been used for a long time to study the exciton dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data obtained with the pump - probe technique is usually successfully described by means of optical bloch equations , where the coupling between the pump and probe pulses is accounted for in the dielectric susceptibility of the structure by non - linear in the light amplitude terms  @xcite .",
    "the physical processes responsible for the nonlinearity in semiconductor nanostructures are depletion of the ground state due to the pauli blockade and coulomb screening of excitons , which reduce the oscillator strength of the exciton transition .",
    "the depletion of the ground state by pump field is a common effect for two - level quantum systems , whereas the exciton - exciton interaction is typical for semiconductors only .",
    "the dynamics of polaritons in microcavities has a lot in common with dynamics of other excitonic systems , however , due to the coupled light - matter nature of the polariton states , there are substantial differences in their behaviour . in particular , in contrast to conventional nanostructures , where after excitation with a short light pulse the excitons evolve in the absence of the electromagnetic field , the electromagnetic field in microcavities is present during the whole lifetime of polaritons . as a result",
    ", additional effects , such as the blue shift of polariton energy levels under intense optical excitation , appear . as we will show in this work",
    ", it is mainly the blue shift effect , that is responsible for formation of rabi oscillations in a pump - probe signal .",
    "we have investigated the transient optical response of a semiconductor microcavity with ingaas quantum wells ( qws ) using spectrally resolved pump - probe technique .",
    "we have revealed distinct rabi oscillations of the optical signals at each of the polariton modes .",
    "for all excitation conditions we tried the observed oscillations corresponding to lower and upper polariton modes are found to have opposite phases . in order to identify the nonlinear effects that contribute to the formation of the measured signal",
    "we have developed a theoretical model .",
    "the experimentally studied sample is a relatively low - finesse microcavity ( @xmath1  2000 ) , which consists of 17 and 21 pairs of alas / gaas layers .",
    "the four groups of pairs of in@xmath2ga@xmath3as quantum wells with different concentration of in ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) are embedded inside the microcavity .",
    "the cavity length is variable across the sample plane , which allows one to change the detuning between the exciton and photon modes .",
    "the photon mode is tuned to the resonance with a deeper well with @xmath5 .",
    "the distance between the neighboring qws is sufficiently large , so that one can neglect the effects of the inter - well carrier tunneling and coupling .",
    "the substrate is transparent in the spectral range of qw excitonic resonance , which allows one to study the sample in the transmission geometry .",
    "the sample was cooled down to the temperature of 5  k in a closed - cycle helium cryostat . in the experimental setup ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the emission of femtosecond titan - sapphire laser with the duration of 100 fs and the repetition frequency of 80 mhz was split into two beams . the first , pump , beam was directed along the sample normal and focused with a lens with a focal length of 150 mm into the spot with a 70  @xmath6 m diameter .",
    "the second , probe , beam was incident at a 5@xmath7 angle with respect to the sample normal , passing through the delay line and focused into a spot of 30  @xmath6 m diameter .",
    "the probe emission passing through the sample was focused into spectrometer and detected by a nitrogen - cooled ccd - camera .",
    "the ccd - camera scan was synchronized with a motion of the delay line that allowed us to observe the transmission spectrum as a function of the delay time between the probe and pump pulses .",

    "these two peaks correspond to the upper and lower polariton modes , which are formed in the sample .",
    "the investigations were carried out at the sample point with a negative detuning , @xmath9  mev , between the cavity and exciton modes .",
    "the short - period oscillations observed at the spectral contours are related to the light interference in the sample substrate .",

    "such an asymmetry of the signal decay is typical for nonlinear optical phenomena driven by the third - order nonlinearities  @xcite .",

    "as a result of the strong light - matter coupling the excited states of a semiconductor quantum well embedded in a microcavity are superpositions of matter excitations ( excitons ) and electromagnetic field ( photon mode ) .",

    "the increase of the @xmath117 ratio at higher pump powers for upb might be attributed to the exciton - exciton scattering , which drives the phase relaxation of polarization .    to confirm that the inverse - phase behaviour of rabi oscillations is a specific feature of the microcavity systems with strong light - matter coupling we performed the same experiment for a quantum well structure without bragg mirrors .",
    "we investigated the sample with an ingaas quantum well of 95  nm width and 2  % indium concentration . in the absorption and photoluminescence spectra we observed series of narrow lines corresponding to optical transitions to or from the quantum - confined excitonic levels .",

    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows intensities of the pump - probe signals measured at energies corresponding to transitions to the first and fourth quantum - confined levels .",
    "the energy difference between the levels is approximately 2  mev , which is comparable to the rabi splitting in the microcavity sample .",
    "one can see distinct signal oscillations , caused by quantum beats between the excitonic states .",
    "in contrast to the microcavity sample , the oscillation phases at two energies coincide , which is typical for quantum beats between matter excitations , such as excitons  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the excitonic quantum beats the microscopic mechanism of the pump - probe signal is related mainly to the depopulation of the ground state due to the pump beam excitation  @xcite . in this case",
    "the quantum beats observed at optical transitions into two excited states have equal phases .",
    "to conclude , we studied the transient pump - probe signal through the microcavity heterostructure with embedded ingaas quantum well . the studies revealed well pronounced oscillations related to the quantum beats between lower and upper polariton modes ( vacuum rabi oscillations ) .",
    "the principle result is that the observed oscillations measured at lower and upper polariton levels have opposite phase .",
    "as revealed by the theoretical analysis , the opposite phases of oscillations are related to the specific light - matter character of polariton states in microcavity , in contrast to quantum beats between pure matter excitations .",
