    "the statistical - thermal model has proved extremely successful in applications to relativistic collisions of both heavy ions and elementary particles ( cf .",

    "thermus  @xcite , a thermal model analysis package , has been developed for incorporation into the object - oriented root framework  @xcite .",
    "this follows closely on the release of share , a statistical hadronisation package , written in ` fortran ` and ` mathematica `  @xcite .",
    "+ at present thermus treats the system quantum numbers @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 within three distinct formalisms : a grand - canonical ensemble , in which the quantum numbers are conserved on average ; a strangeness - canonical ensemble , in which strangeness is exactly conserved , while baryon content and charge are treated grand - canonically ; and , finally , a fully canonical ensemble in which @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are each exactly conserved . a detailed theoretical overview of the statistical - thermal model as applicable to thermus , as well as a description of the structure of thermus ,",
    "can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in a chemical analysis within the grand - canonical ensemble , the statistical - thermal model requires 6 parameters as input : the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath3 , baryon- , strangeness- and charge chemical potentials @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , strangeness saturation factor @xmath7 and fireball volume @xmath8 .",
    "when restricting one s attention to particle or density ratios , the volume dependence largely falls away , unlike in canonical treatments where the particle densities within these ensembles differ from those in the grand - canonical ensemble by correction factors which are strongly volume - dependent  @xcite , as seen in fig .",

    "this allows all density and particle ratios to be plotted in the @xmath12 plane in which the freeze - out condition  @xcite , @xmath13 gev , defines a curve @xmath14 ( fig .",

    "the majority of feeding comes from the baryon sector , while mesons dominate at high energy .",

    "fits to experimental data are easily accomplished within thermus . since feed - down corrections and reconstruction efficiencies are often particle- and experiment specific , thermus is capable of ascribing to each particle yield or ratio of interest its own particle set and associated decay chain ( or separate sets for the numerator and denominator in the case of ratios ) .",
    "use is made of the root ` tminuit ` fitting class .",
    "+ in a recent application of thermus  @xcite , particle ratios measured in au+au collisions at @xmath23 gev by all four rhic experiments , and converted to a common centrality binning in  @xcite , were analysed .",
    "a grand - canonical treatment was employed with quantum statistics and resonance width included for all particles , @xmath15 , and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 as fit parameters . while the temperature and chemical potentials were found to be largely centrality independent , the strangeness saturation factor , @xmath7 , was observed to increase with participant number towards unity in central collisions ( fig .",

    "in conclusion , an analysis package , thermus , has been developed allowing thermal model analyses to be performed within the root framework . within thermus statistical - thermal model calculations",
