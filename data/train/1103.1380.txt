    "one of the most fundamental questions in accretion disk dynamics is how the disk transports angular momentum and accretes to the central object . the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) is widely considered to be the most likely mechanism for the transport process .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the mri under ideal mhd conditions has been studied extensively using both local @xcite and global @xcite numerical simulations .",
    "it has been found that mri generates vigorous mhd turbulence and produce efficient outward transport of angular momentum whose rate is compatible with observations .",
    "however , accretion disks in some systems are only partially ionized , and non - ideal mhd effects need to be taken into account .",
    "in particular , most regions of the protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) are too cold for sufficient thermal ionization , and effective ionization may be achieved only in the disk surface layer due to external ionization sources such as x - ray radiation from the central star and cosmic ray ionization @xcite .",
    "non - ideal mhd effects reflect the incomplete coupling between the disk material and the magnetic field , and substantially affect the growth and saturation of the mri .",
    "there are three non - ideal mhd effects as manifested in the generalized ohms s law , namely the ohmic resistivity , hall effect and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) , with three different regimes associated with the relative importance of these terms . in general",
    ", the ohmic term dominates at high density and very low ionization , the ad term dominates in the opposite limit , and the hall term is important in between . so far",
    "the majority of studies have been focused on the ohmic regime . in this case",
    ", mri is damped when the elsasser number @xmath9 falls below order unity @xcite , where @xmath10 is the alfvn velocity in the vertical direction , @xmath11 is the ohmic resistivity , @xmath12 is the angular frequency of keplerian rotation .",
    "another often quoted criterion is the magnetic reynolds number re@xmath13 for mri to be self - sustained ( where @xmath14 is the sound speed ) , which has the advantage of being independent of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "ohmic resistivity has been used extensively to model the layered accretion in ppds , where the surface layer of the disk is sufficiently ionized to couple to the magnetic field and drive the mri turbulence , while the midplane region is too poorly ionized and  dead \" @xcite .",
    "the importance of hall and ad terms in ppds has been studied in a number of theoretical works , but relatively little attention has been paid to numerical simulations of the non - linear regime .",
    "linear analysis of the mri in the hall regime have been performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the growth rate is strongly affected by the hall term and depends on the sign of @xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless , numerical simulations including both the hall and ohmic terms ( where the ohmic term dominates ) showed that the hall term does not strongly affect the saturation amplitude of mri @xcite .",
    "it is yet to study the behavior of mri in the regime where hall effect dominates over other terms , and to include the hall term in the more realistic vertically stratified simulations .",
    "the relative motion between ions and neutrals leads to ad .",
    "ad is ideally studied using the two - fluid approach , where the ions and neutrals are treated as separate fluids , coupled by the ion - neutral drag via collisions .",
    "moreover , ion and neutral densities are affected by the ionization and recombination processes .",
    "most analytical studies in the linear regime adopt the boussinesq approximation where ion and neutral densities are kept constant @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the growth of mri is suppressed when the collision frequency of a neutral with the ions falls below the orbital frequency . in the mean time , when both vertical and azimuthal field is present , unstable modes always exist due to the effect of ad , and these unstable modes require non - zero radial wavenumbers @xcite . @xcite",
    "also studied the effect of ionization and recombination with compressibility ( for vertical propagating waves ) , and found that the presence of azimuthal and radial field allows the coupling to acoustic and ionization modes , and the azimuthal field tends to stabilize the flow when the recombination time is not too long compared with dynamical time .",
    "the effect ad on the mri in the non - linear regime was first studied by @xcite .",
    "they implemented and tested ad in the  strong coupling \" limit ( see below ) in the zeus code and performed simulations with net vertical flux for various ion - neutral coupling strengths . their results confirmed the stability analysis of @xcite , but their simulations are only two - dimensional and did not follow the evolution much beyond the linear stage . in another study , @xcite included the effect of ad ( also in the strong coupling limit ) in their three - dimensional simulations of a local , vertically stratified disk .",
    "they found that turbulence remains self - sustained in a case where ad time is long compared with orbital time , although reduced in strength , and in another case where the ad time was set comparable to @xmath16 , turbulence decayed .",
    "a systematic study on the non - linear evolution of mri with ad is done by @xcite ( hereafter hs ) using three - dimensional ( 3d ) numerical simulations .",
    "they used the two - fluid approach without considering the ionization - recombination processes , therefore ions and neutrals obey their own continuity equations .",
    "both net - vertical and net - toroidal magnetic configurations were considered .",
    "they found that the system behaves like fully - ionized gas when the ion - neutral collision frequency is greater than @xmath17 , while ions and neutrals behave independently when the collision frequency fall below @xmath18 .",
    "the amplitude of magnetic field at saturation is proportional to the ion density when it is much smaller than the neutral density .",
    "the two - fluid approach adopted by hs is valid when the recombination time scale is long compared with the dynamical time .",
    "however , ad in ppds is in general in the  strong coupling \" limit @xcite .",
    "two conditions must be satisfied in this limit : 1 .",
    "the ion density @xmath19 is negligible compared with the neutral density @xmath20 .",
    "the electron recombination time @xmath21 must be much smaller than the orbital frequency @xmath12 . in this limit",
    ", the ion density is purely determined by the ionization - recombination equilibrium with the neutrals , and the two - fluid formulation is simplified into a single - fluid formalism ( for the neutrals ) . in ppds ,",
    "condition 1 is always satisfied , and we will show in a companion paper @xcite that condition 2 is almost always satisfied .    in this paper , we conduct three - dimensional ( 3d ) local shearing - box simulations to explore the effect of ad on the non - linear evolution of mri in the strong coupling limit .",
    "this is conceptually different from the simulations performed by hs in that the ion density does not obey continuity equation , and is set by the neutral density due to chemical equilibrium .",
    "effectively , this allows the coupling of the mri with acoustic and ionization modes , which leads to more complicated interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , our simulations correspond to the limit where the ion density is negligibly small ( i.e. , @xmath22 in hs ) , which is difficult for two - fluid simulations due to the stiffness of the equations . in the strong coupling limit , there is only one controlling parameter , namely , the ion - neutral collision frequency @xmath23 .",
    "we perform three sets of simulations with net vertical flux , net toroidal flux and both . in each group of runs , we systematically vary @xmath23 as well as the strength of the net field .",
    "our main goal is to study the conditions under which mri turbulence can be self - sustained or is suppressed due to ad . in addition",
    ", we study the properties of the mri turbulence in the ad dominated regime .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "sec : formulation ] we provide the formulation of ad in the strong coupling limit , describe the numerical method and code test problems .",
    "a series of numerical simulations on the non - linear evolution of mri with ad are presented and analyzed in section [ sec : result ] , from which we discuss the condition under which mri turbulence is sustained or suppressed as well as the properties of the mri turbulence in ad dominated regime .",
    "we conclude and briefly discuss various implications in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in weakly ionized plasma , the inertia of the ionized species is negligible .",
    "the gas dynamics can thus be described by single - fluid equations for the neutrals , modified by non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "the effect of ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) derives from the relative motion between the ions and the neutrals . since the ion inertia is negligible , the ion velocity is determined by the balance between the lorentz force and the ion - neutral collisional drag @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the ion mass , number density and velocity respectively , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the density and velocity of the neutrals , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the current density and magnetic field vectors , @xmath32 , with @xmath33 begin the rate coefficient for momentum transfer between the ions and the neutrals and @xmath34 the neutral mass .",
    "the magnetic field is effectively carried by the ions , thus the induction equation now reads @xmath35\\\\ & = \\nabla\\times({{\\boldsymbol}v}\\times{{\\boldsymbol}b } ) -\\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\nabla\\times\\bigg(\\frac{v_a^2 } { \\gamma\\rho_i}{{\\boldsymbol}j}_\\perp\\bigg)\\ , \\end{split}\\label{eq : induction1}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the ion mass density , @xmath36 is the alfvn velocity , @xmath37 is the component of the current density that is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the second term on the right hand side is the ad term , from which the ambipolar diffusivity can be defined as @xmath38 .",
    "the rest of the fluid equations remain the same as the ideal mhd equations . in particular , the momentum equation is unchanged since the neutrals effectively feel the magnetic tension and pressure by the ion - neutral collisions .",
    "the above derivation is strictly valid when electrons and ions are the only charge carriers , and all ions have the same mass .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of multiple ion and charged grain species can be combined into an effective ad coefficient .",
    "ad becomes the dominant non - ideal mhd effect when the gyro - frequency of both the ions and the electrons are higher than their collision frequency with the neutrals ( i.e. , both ions and electrons are coupled to the magnetic field ) . in practice , this corresponds to regions with low density and strong magnetic field .",
    "the effect of ad in rotating disks ( with angular frequency @xmath12 ) is characterized by the parameter @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath39 which is the number of effective collisions for a neutral molecule / atom with the ions in a dynamical time @xmath40 .",
    "physically , we see that @xmath41 , which is equivalent to the elsasser number for ohmic resistivity @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 measures the ratio of the ad time scale over the critical wavelength @xmath43 and the dynamical time scale .    in this paper , we study ad in the strong coupling limit @xcite : the electron ( ion ) recombination time is much shorter than the dynamical time @xmath40 so that the ion density @xmath19 is determined by the local thermodynamical quantities ( density and temperature ) .",
    "the strong coupling limit is widely applicable in protoplanetary disks , and we show in our companion paper @xcite that the recombination time is typically at least one order of magnitude smaller than the dynamical time , even in the disk coronal regions . using the strong coupling limit , we assume the ion density depends on the neutral density @xmath28 in the form of @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the reference density of the ions and the neutrals .",
    "a simple - minded calculation of the ionization - recombination equilibrium gives @xmath47 , which yields @xmath48 . in the equation @xmath49",
    "is the ionization rate , of the order @xmath50 s@xmath51 , @xmath52 is the effective rate coefficient for recombination , of the order @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 s@xmath51 g@xmath51 in the absence of grains @xcite . in reality",
    ", the recombination process is complicated by a complex network of gas phase and grain phase chemical reactions , and we can address the complications by exploring different values of @xmath55 .",
    "being a two - body process in general , and one expects @xmath56 . on the gas density in various chemistry models with and without dust grains , and",
    "@xmath56 holds in essentially all circumstances .",
    "] in fact , our simulations show that the properties of the mri turbulence is insensitive to @xmath55 ( see section [ sssec : nu ] ) .",
    "we use athena , a higher - order godunov mhd code with constrained transport technique to enforce the divergence - free constraint on the magnetic field @xcite for all calculations presented in this paper .",
    "non - ideal mhd terms including ohmic resistivity @xcite , the hall term ( in progress ) and ad ( this paper ) have been developed for athena .",
    "we consider a local patch of a keplerian disk using the standard shearing - box formalism @xcite , which adopts a local reference frame at a fiducial radius corotating with the disk at orbital frequency @xmath12 . in this frame , we write the mhd equations with ad in a cartesian coordinate system as @xmath57 @xmath58\\ , \\label{eq : gasmotion}\\ ] ] @xmath59\\ , \\label{eq : induction2}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the total stress tensor @xmath61 @xmath62 is the identity tensor , @xmath63 is the gas pressure .",

    "disk vertical gravity is ignored and our simulations are vertically unstratified .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state @xmath67 , where @xmath14 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in the azimuthal and vertical directions , while the radial boundary conditions are shearing periodic as usual .    an orbital advection scheme @xcite has been implemented in athena @xcite .",
    "it splits the dynamical equations into two systems , one of which corresponds to linear advection operator with background flow velocity @xmath68 and the other evolves only velocity fluctuations .",
    "the orbital advection scheme not only accelerates the calculation in large box size by admitting larger time steps , but also makes the calculation more accurate .",
    "the last term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : induction2 ] ) represents the ad term , where @xmath19 is the effective ion density , approximated by equation ( [ eq : rhoi ] ) .",
    "non - ideal mhd terms ( e.g. , the ad term ) are implemented in athena in an operator - split way .",
    "over one time step , one first solves the induction equation using only the non - ideal mhd terms , and then solves ideal mhd equations .",
    "the induction equation with ad term is a diffusion equation and is evolved by a fully explicit forward - euler method .",
    "the divergence free condition is maintained using constrained transport : we calculate the ad electromotive force defined at cell edges by interpolating the magnetic field and current density to such locations .",
    "the method is stable , with time step constrained to be proportional to grid size squared .",
    "the overall method is first order accurate in time .    numerical method including",
    "the ad term has been frequently implemented in the framework of two - fluid models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with the main applications on star formation , turbulence and shocks in the interstellar medium . however , single - fluid models for ad in the strong coupling limit relevant to weakly ionized disks @xcite are relatively less studied numerically .",
    "recently , @xcite described an explicit scheme for incorporating ad in the strong coupling limit in an mhd code that is second order accurate , and use super time - stepping to accelerate the calculation when the ad coefficient is large . as we find mri",
    "is suppressed at moderately large ad coefficients ( see section [ sec : result ] ) , super time - stepping is not needed for the purpose of this paper .      in this subsection , we conduct two test problems to examine the performance of our implementation of the ad term . for all these tests ,",
    "we consider non - rotating system and turn off the shearing box source terms on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : gasmotion ] ) .",
    "the effect of ambipolar diffusion is best manifested in c - type shocks @xcite , which is a shock with continuous transitions consequent of the ad .",
    "for the purpose of the code test , here we consider the isothermal c - type test by @xcite , which has become a standard test problem for ad .",

    "in this section we describe three groups of simulations and study the effect of ad on the non - linear evolution of the mri .",

    "we consider three different magnetic field geometries ( net vertical flux , net toroidal flux , both vertical and toroidal flux ) as described in the following three subsections .",

    "for relatively small ad coefficient ( large @xmath0 ) , mri grows quickly from the seed perturbations and saturates into turbulence ; when the effect of ad is strong , however , mri does not grow from our seed perturbations .",
    "in such cases , we initialize the simulations from a turbulent state which is obtained from simulations with relatively large @xmath0 ( see individual subsections for details ) .",

    "we also monitor the kinetic and magnetic energy density , which characterize the strength of the mri turbulence .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to identify the criterion under which sustained turbulence generated by the mri can be maintained .",
    "however , the term  sustained turbulence \" is a somewhat ambiguous concept . in the context of 3d shearing box simulations , small - amplitude oscillations left from decayed hydrodynamical turbulence is present @xcite .",
    "such oscillations produce reynolds stress on the order of @xmath137 with kinetic energy density on the order of @xmath138 , both in normalized unit @xmath139 .",
    "such oscillations are likely to associate with linear modes in the shearing sheet with the origin of acoustic and/or nearly incompressible inertia waves @xcite .",
    "being a conservative godunov mhd code , the athena code preserves the amplitude of these waves without much damping .",
    "therefore , throughout this paper , the level of turbulence we are interested in are those whose time and volume averaged kinetic energy density @xmath140 is on the order of @xmath141 or higher , and/or whose total stress @xmath3 is no less than @xmath137 .",
    "meanwhile , analysis of all our simulations show that the threshold where the mri turbulence can be marginally self - sustained is roughly at the same level .",

    "the correlation can be represented by @xmath223 this result is consistent with findings by @xcite in ideal mhd simulations , and extends it to the non - ideal mhd regime .",
    "analytical study of the saturation of the mri with ohmic resistivity by parasitic modes also predicts similar relations @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , this relation translates to @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the ratio of reynolds to maxwell stress ( typically @xmath226 in the ideal mhd case ) .",
    "this relation implies that the maxwell stress is approximately a fixed fraction of the total magnetic energy , a reasonable result if the magnetic field is dominated by turbulent fluctuations .",
    "only two points appear to deviate from this correlation , which correspond to net toroidal flux simulations with @xmath227 .",
    "we see from table [ tab : turbby ] that in these two simulations , the magnetic energy is dominated by the background toroidal field ( i.e. , in the transition where mri is marginally sustained ) , therefore producing smaller @xmath215 than predicted .",
    "next , we consider the relation between @xmath215 and @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ambeta ] we show scattered plot of @xmath0 and @xmath215 .",
    "we see that @xmath215 does not strongly correlate with @xmath0 , but also depends on the field geometry and the initial field strength",

    "we obtain a fitting formula for @xmath230 given by @xmath231^{1/2}\\ , \\label{eq : constrain}\\ ] ] and is indicated in figure [ fig : ambeta ] .",
    "it asymptotes to @xmath107 at @xmath232 as one expects , while approaches @xmath233 for @xmath2 .",
    "the constraint on @xmath228 at a given @xmath0 allows us to identify the regions in the @xmath0-@xmath215 plane at which mri can or can not operate . in the mean time the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath215 provide the corresponding stress when mri is permitted . combining them together , the main results from the whole paper are best summarized in figure [ fig : constrain ] .",
    "mri permitted regions are in the upper right with the boundary given by equation ( [ eq : constrain ] ) .",
    "it provides useful diagnostics on the properties of the mri in the ad regime in a concise fashion .",
    "first , at a given @xmath0 , the ultimate strength of the mri turbulence ( e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath215 ) depends on the field geometry ( including the net flux ) , but there exists a maximum @xmath3 ( or minimum @xmath215 ) at the most favorable field geometry ( usually contains both net vertical and toroidal fluxes ) .",
    "one way to think about it is to starts with a weak regular field as we perform our simulations . as the system evolves and as the mri amplifies the field , the corresponding position of the system in the diagram moves downward and until it stops at some @xmath234 .",
    "second , mri can be self - sustained for any value of @xmath0 even for @xmath235 .",
    "although we have explored the @xmath0 parameter down to @xmath8 , we believe that it can be extended to further smaller @xmath0 because of the following reasons .",
    "linear analysis by @xcite and @xcite shows in the presence of both vertical and toroidal field , mri can grow at appreciable rate ( approximately @xmath236 when @xmath185 ) even in the limit of @xmath237 provided that the field is sufficiently weak .",
    "this means that mri turbulence can always be self - sustained .",
    "meanwhile , we find that the linear dispersion relation has already approached the small @xmath0 asymptote for @xmath238 .",
    "therefore , we expect the trend in figure [ fig : ambeta ] on @xmath228 to hold to further smaller @xmath0 values .",
    "third , the boundary between the mri permitted and prohibited regions is only suggestive but it does not necessarily imply sharp transitions .",
    "our simulations are restricted by the limited box height ( @xmath158 ) since they are unstratified . in reality , as one increases the field strength , the transition from sustained mri turbulence to its suppression involves the effect of vertical stratification of gas density in the disks , and may be a smooth process . before justified by stratified simulations , which is left for our future work , this result should be taken with some caution .",
    "in particular , when vertical stratification is include , linear analysis by @xcite and @xcite for ideal and non - ideal mhd have suggested the existence of global modes in the disk even in low @xmath184 and small elsasser number . on the other hand , in the case of ohmic resistivity , the criterion that ohmic",
    "elsasser number equals one being the boundary between mri permitted and suppressed regions identified in unstratified simulations @xcite do agree with results from stratified simulations @xcite .",
    "weakly ionized plasma is subject to a number of non - ideal mhd effects due to the collisional coupling between the ionized species and the neutrals . among them , ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) results from the relative motion between the ions and the neutrals .",
    "it becomes most important when the gyro - frequencies of both the electrons and the ions in the magnetic field are larger than their collision frequencies with the neutrals , so all ionized species are effectively coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "consequently , ad usually dominates other non - ideal mhd effects ( ohmic resistivity and hall effect ) in regions with low density and high magnetic field . when the ion inertia is negligible and when the electron recombination time is much less than the dynamical time , ad is in the",
    " strong coupling \" limit , and can be studied by single - fluid models . in this limit",
    ", the effect of ad is fully characterized by the parameter @xmath0 , the number of times a neutral molecule / atom collide with the ions in a dynamical time , and is the equivalence of the elsasser number for ohmic resistivity .",
    "the effect of ad becoemes dynamically important when @xmath0 approaches order unity .    in weakly ionized disks such as the protoplanetary disks ( ppds )",
    ", ad dominates other non - ideal mhd effects in the disk upper layer as well as the outer regions of the ppds @xcite . the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which is considered as the major mechanism for providing angular momentum transport via the mhd turbulence , is strongly affected by ad . in the linear regime , the growth of the mri is reduced or suppressed in the presence of ad , depending on the value of @xmath0 and the magnetic field geometry @xcite .",
    "two - fluid simulations of the non - linear evolution of the mri with ad by @xcite showed that significant turbulence and angular momentum transport occurs when @xmath239 .",
    "however , they ignored the processes of ionization and recombination , and the results are not directly applicable to the ppds , where the strong coupling limit holds @xcite .",
    "we have implemented ad in the strong coupling limit in the athena mhd code using a first - order accurate operator - split method .",
    "its performance is verified by numerical tests on standing c - type shocks and the damping of mhd waves .",
    "we then perform local shearing box numerical simulations to study the effect of ad on the non - linear evolution of the mri in the strong coupling limit .",
    "our simulations are vertically unstratified with vertical box size equals the disk scale height @xmath158 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study how the properties of the mri turbulence is affected by ad , especially the condition under which mri turbulence can be self - sustained .",
    "we perform three groups of simulations with different magnetic field configurations , and the main results are summarized below .    1 .",
    "net vertical flux simulations .",
    "unstable linear mri modes always exist for any value of @xmath0 , with longer wavelength and smaller growth rate as @xmath0 gets smaller .",
    "mri turbulence can be self - sustained as long as the wavelength of the most unstable mode @xmath173 is within @xmath158 ( so the vertical field has to be progressively weaker for @xmath237 ) . at fixed @xmath0 , the total turbulent stress @xmath3 increases monotonically with net vertical flux , until reaches the maximum when @xmath240 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath3 rapidly decreases with @xmath0 when @xmath241 , from about @xmath242 at @xmath232 down to about @xmath243 at @xmath6 .",
    "it falls below @xmath138 at @xmath244 and is around of @xmath137 at @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   net toroidal flux simulations .",
    "this field configuration is more stable . at fixed @xmath245 and net flux ,",
    "the turbulent stress @xmath3 from net toroidal flux simulations is smaller than that from net vertical flux simulations by about an order of magnitude .",
    "we do not find any evidence that mri turbulence can be self - sustained at the level of @xmath246 when @xmath2 for any net toroidal flux .",
    "simulations with both net vertical and net toroidal fluxes . when @xmath209 and fixed net vertical flux , the strength of the mri turbulence is similar to the pure net vertical flux case , but slowly increases with the net toroidal flux .",
    "when @xmath2 , the most unstable mode has non - zero radial wavenumber comparable to the vertical wavenumber , and the fastest growth rate asymptotes to some appreciable value even as @xmath237 .",
    "the maximum value of the turbulent stress @xmath3 largely exceeds the pure net vertical flux case when @xmath212 , with @xmath247 at @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we find that similar to the effect of ohmic dissipation , the ratio of the fluctuating part of the magnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density decreases as ad is stronger .",
    "similarly , the ratio of maxwell stress to reynolds stress also drops at smaller @xmath0 .",
    "the power spectra density of the mri turbulence in the ad dominated regime does not show any new features other than a rescaling from that in the ideal mhd case .",
    "we do not find any evidence that ad leads to the formation of sharp current structures in the mri turbulence as proposed by @xcite , but we confirm that ad tends to reduce the component of current perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field @xcite , although to a lesser extent .    combining the results from these three groups of simulations , we find a strong correlation between the turbulent stress @xmath3 and the gas to magnetic pressure ratio @xmath218 at the saturated state , given by @xmath248 .",
    "the sustainability and saturation level of the mri turbulence depends on the value of @xmath0 , the magnetic field geometry , and the magnetic field strength .",
    "it is best summarized in figure [ fig : constrain ] . in short , at a given @xmath0 , there exists a maximum value of turbulent stress @xmath3 achievable from the most favorable geometries ( generally with both net vertical and toroidal fluxes ) .",
    "correspondingly , at a given @xmath0 , there exists a maximum field strength above which mri is suppressed , and the maximum field strength rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath0 . for future reference",
    ", we quote the turbulent stress @xmath249 and @xmath250 as the maximum value we have found in our simulations at @xmath6 and @xmath161 respectively .    in principle , in the presence of both net vertical and net toroidal fluxes , mri turbulence can be self - sustained at any values of @xmath0 , provided that the magnetic field is sufficiently small . nevertheless , the resulting turbulent stress @xmath3 would be much smaller than @xmath250 when @xmath251 , and would be inefficient in transporting angular momentum in most astrophysical disks .",
    "moreover , we recall that ad dominates other non - ideal mhd effects ( ohmic resistivity and hall effect ) at relatively low density and relatively large magnetic field",
    ". when the magnetic field is too weak as required for the wavelength of the most unstable mri mode to be within @xmath158 , ad may no longer be the dominant non - ideal mhd effect , and our results are not directly applicable .",
    "therefore , while generalization of our results to @xmath251 are possible , it may not be physically relevant .",
    "we have shown that the effect of ad on the non - linear evolution of the mri depends on the field geometry , which is arbitrarily assigned in our local shearing box simulations .",
    "in reality , the field geometry depends on the global evolution of the disk .",
    "let us imagine one scenario and apply our local simulation results to a global picture .",
    "if the disk is initially threaded by a very weak vertical field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the initial growth of the mri may be governed by the ohmic resistivity and/or the hall effect .",
    "ad takes over when substantial amplification of the field occurs and dominate the non - linear evolution of the mri .",
    "the saturation of the mri generates strong vertical and azimuthal fields , and redistributes the vertical and toroidal fluxes across the entire disk .",
    "no longer limited by the enforced net fluxes as in our local simulations , the saturation of the mri could probably arrange the magnetic field to achieve the most favorable local field configurations such that the field is maximumly amplified and @xmath252 is achieved .",
    "therefore , given the value of @xmath0 in the disk , and provided that ad dominates other non - ideal mhd effects , we expect the field strength in the disk to be largely determined by the value of @xmath253 , via equation ( [ eq : constrain ] ) , from which one can also obtain a rough estimate of @xmath254 .",
    "our results are mostly relevant to the structure and evolution of the ppds .",
    "details about the application require considerations of the ionization and recombination processes in the disks with an appropriate chemistry model , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in our companion paper @xcite , we will take into account all non - ideal mhd effects together and study their implications in the ppds .",
