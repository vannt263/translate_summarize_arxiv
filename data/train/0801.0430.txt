    "the solution of the @xmath7 worldsheet string theory is one of the cornerstones of the ads / cft duality program . despite continuous effort and progress on classical aspects in particular @xcite , and",
    "the generally accepted presence of both integrability and conformal invariance symmetries , most aspects of the quantum theory remain elusive .",
    "it is natural to try to understand some aspects of this quantum theory by first tackling simpler models with similar properties .",
    "the so called @xmath0 coset model - specifically , a sigma model on the supersphere @xmath8 - is a very attractive candidate for such an exercise : like the @xmath7 worldsheet theory it is conformal invariant and its target space is a supergroup coset .",
    "of course , it lacks other aspects such as the brst structure of the string theory .",
    "apart from the string theory motivation , models such as the @xmath0 coset model are extremely interesting from the pure conformal field theory point of view .",
    "indeed , they are sigma models which are massless without any kind of topological term , and for a large range of values of the coupling constant @xmath1 . to make things more precise let us briefly remind the reader of some generalities .",
    "supersphere sigma models have target super space the supersphere @xmath9 and can be viewed as a `` supersymmetric '' extension of the nonlinear @xmath10 sigma models ( which differs of course from the usual @xmath10 `` supersymmetric '' models ) .",
    "use as coordinates a real scalar field @xmath11 where the first @xmath12 components are bosons , the last @xmath13 ones fermions , and the invariant bilinear form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the orthosymplectic metric @xmath16 @xmath17 denoting the identity .",
    "the unit supersphere is defined by the constraint @xmath18 the action of the sigma model ( conventions are that the boltzmann weight is @xmath19 ) reads @xmath20 the perturbative @xmath21 function depends only on @xmath22 to all orders ( see , e.g. , ref @xcite ) , and is the same as the one of the @xmath10 model with @xmath23 .",
    "physics can be reliably understood from the first order beta function @xmath24 the model for @xmath25 positive flows to strong coupling for @xmath26 . like in the ordinary sigma models case ,",
    "the symmetry is restored at large length scales , and the field theory is massive . for @xmath27 meanwhile , the model flows to weak coupling , and the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "one expects this scenario to work for @xmath1 small enough , and the corresponding goldstone phase to be separated from a non perturbative strong coupling phase by a critical point .",
    "the case we are interested in here is @xmath28 , where the @xmath21 function vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory , and the model is expected to be conformal invariant , at least for @xmath1 small enough , the goldstone phase being replaced by a phase with continuously varying exponents not unlike the low temperature kosterlitz thouless phase .",
    "how the group symmetry combines with the ( logarithmic ) conformal symmetry in such models is largely unknown .",
    "it is an essential question to be solved before any serious attempts to understanding universality classes in non interacting disordered 2d electronic systems can be contemplated @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 coset model was considered in particular in two papers by mann and polchinski using the massless scattering and bethe ansatz approaches .",
    "this is indeed a natural idea , since supersphere sigma models are in general integrable , and , when massive ( ie @xmath26 ) can be described by a scattering theory involving particles in the fundamental representation of the group .",
    "the @xmath29 matrix is well known @xmath30 here , @xmath17 is the identity , @xmath31 is the graded permutation operator , and @xmath32 is proportional to the projector on the identity representation . for @xmath33 arbitrary , factorizability requires that @xmath34 where @xmath35 , while @xmath36 itself is determined , up to cdd factors , by crossing symmetry and unitarity .",
    "one immediately observes that when @xmath37 , the amplitude @xmath36 cancels out , leaving a scattering matrix with a simpler tensorial structure , since the @xmath31 operator disappears .",
    "this corresponds to a particular point @xcite on the sigma model critical line ( where , among other things , the symmetry is enhanced to @xmath38 ) , the rest of which is not directly accessible by this construction",
    ". is special and allows for an extension of the s matrix to the whole @xmath39 critical line .",
    "] the idea used in @xcite is to consider an analytical continuation to @xmath33 real , and an approach to @xmath28 with proper scaling of the mass . though interesting results were obtained , the emphasis in these papers was not on conformal properties .",
    "another line of attack , more suited to the conformal aspects , was launched by read and saleur in 2001 @xcite , who proposed to use a lattice regularization to control the integrable features of the model .",
    "they obtained in this way the spectrum of critical exponents for several related sigma models on super target spaces , including the @xmath0 coset one at a particular ( critical ) value of the coupling @xmath1 .",
    "the results exhibited several mysterious features , including a pattern of large degeneracies , and a set of values of the exponents covering ( modulo integers ) all the rationals .",
    "in two subsequent papers @xcite , it was argued further that many algebraic properties of the conformal field theory could be obtained at the lattice level already .",
    "these include fusion , and the structure of conformal `` towers '' ( see below for further details ) .    the work we present in this paper and its companion is an attempt at understanding the conformal field theoretic description of the @xmath0 model for all values of the coupling by using a lattice regularization .",
    "foremost in the lattice approach is the understanding of the algebraic structure of the lattice model - the algebra defined by the local transfer matrices and its commutant . while in the cases discussed in @xcite most necessary results",
    "were already available in the mathematical literature , the situation here is much more complicated : in a few words , we have to deal , instead of the temperley lieb algebra , with the _ brauer algebra _ whose representation theory , in the non semi - simple case , is far from fully understood .",
    "an important part of our work has consisted in filling up the necessary gaps of the literature , sometimes rigorously , but sometimes at the price of some conjectures .",
    "this algebraic work is the subject of the first paper , which we realize might be a bit hard to read for a physics reader .",
    "we capitalize on the algebraic effort in the companion paper , where the boundary conformal field theory for the coset sigma model is analyzed thoroughly .    in the second section of this paper",
    "we discuss generalities about lattice regularizations of @xmath10 sigma models in 2 dimensions and define the model we shall be interested in . in section 3 , the transfer matrix , the loop reformulation and the associated brauer algebra are introduced and discussed .",
    "section 4 is the main section , where the full decomposition of the hilbert space of the lattice model under the action of @xmath0 and @xmath3 is obtained .",
    "our main result can be found in eqs .   and .",

    "lattice discretizations of @xmath10 sigma models have had a long history .",
    "the simplest way to go is obviously to introduce spins taking values in the target manifold - the sphere @xmath76 - on the sites of a discrete lattice , with an interaction energy of the heisenberg type @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 stands for the bilinear @xmath10-invariant quadratic form ) .",
    "this is however difficult to study technically , as the number of degrees of freedom on each site is infinite .",
    "a possible way to go is to discretize the target space , leading to various types of `` cubic models '' @xcite .",
    "another way which has proved especially fruitful in two dimensions has been to reformulate the problem of calculating the partition or correlation functions geometrically by using the techniques of high or low temperature expansions , thus obtaining graphs with complicated interaction rules and weights determined by properties of the underlying groups .",
    "the simplest of these formulations appeared in @xcite where the authors studied the @xmath10 model on the honeycomb lattice in two dimensions , and replaced moreover the term @xmath79 by its considerably simpler high temperature approximation @xmath80 , @xmath81 @xcite . expanding",
    "the brackets , in say the calculation of the partition function , one can draw graphs by putting a bond between neighboring sites @xmath82 and @xmath83 whenever the term @xmath84 is picked up .",
    "the integral over spin variables leaves only loops , with a fugacity equal to @xmath85 as there are @xmath85 colors one can contract .",
    "note that because of the very low coordination number of the honeycomb lattice , only self - avoiding loops are obtained .",
    "this leads to the well known self - avoiding loop gas partition function : @xmath86 where the sum is taken over all configurations @xmath87 of self avoiding , mutually avoiding closed loops in number @xmath43 , covering a total of @xmath32 edges .",
    "note that once an expression such as ( [ nien_triv ] ) is written down , it is possible to analytically continue the definition of the model for @xmath85 an arbitrary real number . barring the use of superalgebras , only @xmath85 integer greater or equal to one has a well defined meaning as a spin model ( the case @xmath88 coincides with the ising model   is different from @xmath89 because of the additional @xmath90 freedom in choosing the sign of the determinant . ] ) . in two dimensions ,",
    "the mermin wagner theorem prevents spontaneous symmetry breaking , so for @xmath85 integer , critical behavior can only occur for @xmath91 . analysis of the same beta function suggests however that lattice models defined by suitable analytic continuation should have a goldstone low temperature phase for all @xmath92 , though it says nothing about whether this phase might end by a second or first order phase transition .    model ( [ nien_triv ] ) lacks interaction terms which would appear with less drastic choices of the lattice and the interactions : these are the terms where the loops intersect , either by going over the same edge , or over the same vertex , maybe many times . it has often been argued that such terms are irrelevant for the study of the critical points of the @xmath10 models in two dimensions .",
    "most of the interest has focused on such critical points for @xmath93 $ ] , which have geometrical applications - in particular the case @xmath94 is related with the physics of self - avoiding walks .",
    "it turns out however that intersection terms are crucial for the understanding of low temperature phases .",
    "indeed , the model ( [ nien_triv ] ) _ does have _ a sort of goldstone phase for @xmath93 $ ] called the dense phase , but its properties are not generic , and destroyed by the introduction of a small amount of intersections . a simple way to see that the dense phase is not generic",
    "is that the exponents at @xmath37 are always those of the kosterlitz thouless transition point : model ( [ nien_triv ] ) does not allow one to enter the low temperature phase of the xy model . also , model ( [ nien_triv ] ) has a first order transition for @xmath95 , which is not the behavior expected from the sigma model analysis .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that model ( [ nien_triv ] ) can be repaired by allowing for some intersections .",
    "the minimal scenario one can imagine is to define a similar model on the square lattice , and allow for self intersections at vertices only , so either none , one or two loops go through the same vertex .",
    "the resulting objects are often called trails .",
    "this gives the new partition function @xmath96 where the sum is taken over all configurations @xmath97 of closed loops , which visit edges of the lattice at most once , in number @xmath43 , covering a total of @xmath32 edges , with @xmath17 intersections .",
    "the phase diagram of this model has not been entirely investigated .",
    "it is expected that at least for @xmath98 small enough , the critical behavior obtained with @xmath99 is not changed ( though @xmath100 is ) , while the low temperature behavior @xmath101 will be .    in @xcite",
    "a yet slightly different version was considered corresponding , roughly , to the limit of very large @xmath102 , where all the edges of the lattice are covered .",
    "the partition function of this fully packed trails model then depends on only two parameters : @xmath103 and an example of allowed configuration is given in figure [ f : loop_cov ] .",
    "numerical and analytical arguments suggest strongly that this model has all the generic properties of the @xmath10 sigma model in the spontaneously broken symmetry phase ( such that one might derive from analytic continuation in @xmath85 of the rg equations ) , for all @xmath104 .",

    "periodic imaginary time runs vertically ]    note that expression ( [ ours ] ) can be obtained very naturally if instead of putting the degrees of freedom on the vertices , one puts them on the edges of the lattice . in this case ,",
    "the minimal form of interaction involves two edges crossing at one vertex .",
    "invariance under the @xmath10 group allows for three invariant tensors as illustrated on the figure [ f : vert ] , while isotropy and invariance under an overall scale change of the boltzmann weights leaves one with a single free parameter , the crossing weight @xmath98 .",
    "graphical representation of the contractions on the invariant tensors reproduces eq .",
    "( [ ours ] ) , as will be discussed below .    for @xmath92 ,",
    "model ( [ ours ] ) flows to weak coupling in the ir , and therefore it is expected that the critical properties of the corresponding low temperature ( goldstone ) phase do not depend on @xmath98 , a fact checked numerically in @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath37 is expected to be different : as mentioned already in the introduction , the beta function of the corresponding sigma model is exactly zero so the coupling constant does not renormalize .",
    "it is indeed easy to see that the loop model ( [ ours ] ) with @xmath37 is equivalent to the 6 vertex model with @xmath107 .",
    "consider the vertices of the 6 vertex model as represented on figure [ f:6v ] .",
    "we chose isotropic weights @xmath108 .",
    "we can decide to split the vertices of a configuration into pieces of oriented loops as represented on figure [ f:6vo2map ] . for each vertex , there are two possible splittings , and we assume that they are chosen with equal probability .",
    "the loops obtained by connecting all the pieces together provide a dense covering of the lattice , and come with two possible orientations , hence a fugacity of two once the orientations are summed over .",
    "the loops can intersect , with a weight @xmath98 given from the obvious correspondence : @xmath109 and thus @xmath110     symmetric six vertex model ]        we note that there are indeed _ three _ invariant tensors for the case of @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding projectors are @xmath111 .",
    "they project respectively on two one dimensional representations , and on a single two dimensional one .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 covers the interval @xmath113 $ ] as @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "changing @xmath112 is well known to change the exponents of 6 vertex model , and therefore eq .  ( [ ours ] ) for @xmath37 exhibits a critical line , which is in fact in the universality class of the continuous xy ( @xmath39 ) model in the low temperature ( kosterlitz thouless ) phase .",
    "all what was said so far can be easily generalized to the case of spins taking values on a supersphere @xmath115 .",
    "the fugacity of loops is now equal to @xmath22 : this combination is the number of bosonic minus the number of fermionic coordinates , and follows from the usual fact that when contracting fermions along a loop , a minus sign is generated   models to the case of orthosymplectic groups dates back to the work of parisi and sourlas @xcite . ] , see sec .",
    "[ sec:1749 ] .",
    "the loop model formulation therefore provides a convenient graphical representation of the discrete supersphere sigma models for all @xmath22 , in particular @xmath116 where interesting physics is expected to occur .",
    "this physics was explored in @xcite , and the expected results were obtained for @xmath27 . the purpose of this paper is to explore the more challenging @xmath28 case .",
    "of course , at the naive level of partition functions and without worrying about boundary conditions , it looks as if there is no difference between the @xmath10 spin model and its supersphere cousins provided @xmath117 .",
    "the point is that the _ observables _ of the models are different or , at the very least , come with different multiplicities .",
    "indeed , consider for instance correlation functions of spin variables . in the @xmath39 case ,",
    "the spin has only two components @xmath118 , so one can not build a totally antisymmetric tensor on three indices .",
    "this means that the corresponding operator ( which has a nice geometrical interpretation to be given in the next paper ) will not be present in this case , though it will be in the @xmath0 model when @xmath119 .",
    "note that in general , correlators involving spins within the first @xmath12 bosonic and the first @xmath13 fermionic labels will be the same for _ any _ choice of group @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "bosonic and @xmath123 fermionic degrees of freedom are the same in both cases .",
    "] this is immediately proved by performing a graphical expansion of the correlator : variables outside of the set of the first @xmath12 bosonic and the first @xmath13 fermionic labels are not getting contracted with the spins in the correlators , and cancel against each other in the loop contractions .    a standard trick to extract the full operator content of a model is to study the partition function with different boundary conditions .",
    "consider for instance the spin model on an annulus with some symmetry preserving boundary conditions in the space direction . with what we will call periodic boundary conditions ( corresponding to taking the supertrace of the evolution operator ) in the time direction , representations of @xmath0",
    "will always be counted with their superdimension , and the partition function will be identical with the one of the @xmath39 case .",
    "but if we take antiperiodic boundary conditions , we will get a modified partition function ( in the sense of @xcite ) which is a _ trace _ over the hilbert space instead of a supertrace , counts all observables with the multiplicities ( not supermultiplicities ) , and will turn out to be a very complex object",
    ".    a good algebraic understanding of the lattice model will be essential to make further progress , and , since the area is largely unexplored , this will occupy us for most of the rest of this first paper .",
    "as discussed briefly in the introduction , the @xmath41 spin model we consider is most easily defined on a square lattice with degrees of freedom ( states ) on the edges and interactions taking place at vertices .",
    "the set of states on every edge is a copy of the base space @xmath124 of the fundamental @xmath41 representation .",
    "interactions at a vertex can be encoded in a local transfer matrix @xmath125 acting on @xmath126 and commuting with the @xmath41 supergroup action .",
    "we call @xmath125 an intertwiner and write @xmath127 .",
    "the boltzmann weights of the model are components of the transfer matrix along a basis of intertwiners .",
    "a natural choice of basis are the projectors onto @xmath41 irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of the tensor product of two fundamental @xmath41 representations .",
    "to find them one can apply the same ( anti)symmetrization and trace substraction techniques used for reducing @xmath10 tensor representations . if @xmath128 is a mod 2 graded set of basis vectors in @xmath124 with grading @xmath129 , the decomposition of @xmath126 will read @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the @xmath41 invariant tensor , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 ( resp .",

    "the characters of classical groups , evaluated on a group element , are polynomials in the eigenvalues of that element in the defining representation for the group .",
    "the infinite rank limit corresponds to considering polynomials depending on an infinite number of such variables .",
    "irreducible characters are polynomials with a very specific symmetry , which is not obscured by the restriction of finite number of variables in the infinite rank limit . these objects are known as _",
    "symmetric functions_. when the number of variables is set finite most symmetric functions become functionally dependent .",
    "once an algebraically independent subset of symmetric functions is chosen , which is the actual set of characters in the case of classical groups , the modification rules `` for characters '' represent arbitrary symmetric functions along this basis .",
    "one can introduce generalized symmetric functions @xmath332 for the supergroup @xmath41 according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : elchar ] , [ eq : onchar ] ) , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the major difference with respect to classical groups is that functionally independent generalized symmetric functions are no longer irreducible characters of the supergroup .",
    "however , modification rules for @xmath332 exist and have been derived in @xcite .",
    "we bring them bellow in the form of eq .   with the notations of our paper .",
    "suppose that @xmath51 is a typical @xmath40 weight .",
    "then , according to @xcite , only @xmath332 with @xmath198 of the form @xmath51 dressed by balanced strips @xmath1044 modify to @xmath73 @xmath1045 here @xmath1046 is the superdeterminant representation .",
    "we have also introduced the weight function @xmath1047 defined on skew partitions composed of balanced strips and @xmath1048 is the number of columns in @xmath1049 .",
    "consider now , the @xmath40 block labeled by the weight @xmath1050 with degree of atypicality @xmath501 and no removable balanced strips .",
    "then , any weight @xmath51 in the block @xmath1051 of @xmath198 is of the form @xmath1050 dressed up by @xmath1052 balanced strips .",
    "then , according to @xcite , @xmath332 with @xmath198 of the form @xmath1050 dressed up by @xmath1053 balanced strips modifies to @xmath1054    for a typical weight @xmath51 we put @xmath320 equal to @xmath51 dressed up by the balanced strip of minimal length @xmath1055 if @xmath1056 . in order to prove that @xmath1057 one has to show that @xmath1055 runs over an odd number of columns .",
    "indeed , each box in @xmath1055 belongs either to a horizontal or a vertical part of the strip , except for the boxes at the corners of @xmath1055 , which belong to both .",
    "we say the balanced pair @xmath1060 has an allowable configuration if both boxes belong either to horizontal or vertical parts of @xmath1055 , otherwise @xmath1061 has a non allowable configuration . as discussed in app .",
    "[ sec : tmb ] , to every non allowable configurations of @xmath1061 with content @xmath1062 corresponds a removable balanced strip in @xmath51 with its ends in the border boxes with content @xmath1063 or @xmath1064 depending on weather @xmath938 is on a horizontal or a vertical part of @xmath957 .",
    "because @xmath51 is a @xmath40 typical weight and , thus , has no removable balanced strips , there are only allowable configuration of balanced pairs in @xmath1055 .",
    "thus , a balanced pair in @xmath1055 , which is not in the same column , indexes either two different columns or none .",
    "there is at most one column containing the whole balanced pair and it appears always if @xmath85 is odd and only for @xmath1056 if @xmath85 is even , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corner ] .",
    "thus , @xmath1058 is always odd for @xmath12 odd and even only if @xmath1059 for @xmath12 even .",
    "let @xmath1049 denote the @xmath82th lowest length strip addable to @xmath51 and @xmath1048 the number of columns in it .",
    "one can prove by the same method that @xmath1065 has an even number of columns , one of which is already in @xmath1049 and , consequently , @xmath1066 is odd .    again by the same method it is possible to prove that @xmath1067 has an even number of columns .",
    "this is because @xmath1068 contains a substrip @xmath1069 which can be obtained by moving down along the diagonal the strip @xmath1055 .",
    "applying what was said above about @xmath1065 to @xmath1070 we see that @xmath1071 .",
    "if @xmath51 is typical and @xmath1072 then @xmath1073 is the next partition in the block of @xmath51 , while if @xmath1074 then @xmath1075 is the next partition in the bloc of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore we have just shown , as claimed in sec .",
