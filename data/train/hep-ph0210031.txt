    "flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and cp - violating processes are very sensitive probes of new physics .",
    "the gim suppression of fcnc amplitudes is generally absent beyond the standard model ( sm ) , giving possibly large enhancements of fcnc processes over the sm predictions .",
    "furthermore , cp violation in weak decays in the sm is entirely governed by a single phase in the ckm matrix , resulting in a strong correlation between all cp - violating processes . in general , this correlation is lost beyond the sm . until now ,",
    "all experimental data are fully compatible with the sm , as can be clearly seen from the standard analysis of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) @xcite .",
    "one is then left with two basic questions : _",
    "i ) _ how can the sm be extended without spoiling the impressive consistency of the sm ut fit ? _",
    "ii ) _ can we still hope to see some hint of new physics in low - energy fcnc and cp - violating phenomena ?",
    "while these two questions can be considered in full generality , i will focus in the rest of this talk on supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is at present the most successful extension of the sm with respect to the consistency with precision electroweak data .",
    "susy can modify the sm predictions on fcnc and cp - violating processes in three different ways : 1 ) with additional loop contributions still proportional to elements of the ckm matrix . a typical example of this kind of contributions is given by stop and chargino loops .",
    "this effect is present in any susy extension of the sm .",
    "2 ) with additional loop contributions governed by new sources of flavour and cp violation @xcite .",
    "when these new sources of fcnc are present , typically the largest contributions arise from gluino exchange .",
    "this effect is absent in susy models with minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : mfv ] ) .",
    "3 ) with additional tree - level contributions . these can only arise in models with r - parity violation , and typically affect fcnc processes in a dramatic way .",
    "clearly , models in which only the first kind of contributions are present tend to agree much better with experimental data than more general models . on the other hand",
    ", the presence of contributions of the second or third kind usually generates larger deviations from sm predictions on yet unobserved fcnc and cp violating processes . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath0 physics is the next frontier of testing susy in weak decays : @xmath0 factories and the tevatron will provide us with data on a large variety of fcnc and cp - violating @xmath0 decays , and @xmath0 physics is playing an ever - increasing role in the ut fit . in the following , i will discuss in some detail susy effects in @xmath0 physics in models with r - parity conservation .",
    "physics generated by r - violating couplings , see @xcite . ]",
    "let me start by considering models with mfv , defined by the following requirements .",
    "first , i assume that all sfermion masses are flavour diagonal and real at the electroweak scale , and all gaugino and higgs mass parameters are real .",
    "this ensures that the ckm matrix is the only source of flavour and cp violation , so that only the first kind of contributions discussed above can arise .",
    "second , i assume that @xmath3 is not too large ( @xmath4 ) , so that no new operator is generated in the effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 decays .",
    "this implies that the sm analysis of perturbative and non - perturbative strong interaction effects can also be applied in this model .",
    "finally , i assume that all squarks are degenerate except for the stop .",
    "this ensures that susy only modifies the contribution of the top quark in the sm .",
    "in particular , this means that susy contributions cancel from all quantities that in the sm do not depend on the top quark mass . a typical example is given by the ratio of the mass difference of @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons .",
    "indeed , a universal unitarity triangle ( uut ) can be constructed in these models , independent of susy contributions @xcite , once a sufficient number of top - mass independent quantities becomes available . at present , this is not the case and one needs to perform the full ut analysis to determine the ckm parameters for any given value of susy masses .",
    "the relevant susy parameters for the analysis are stop masses and mixing angle , the mass of the lightest chargino , the @xmath7 parameter , @xmath8 and the charged higgs mass .",
    "potentially large contributions to @xmath9 arise ; once the constraints from @xmath9 and the lower bounds on higgs and susy masses from direct searches are taken into account , the ut fit in these models is indistinguishable from the sm one @xcite .",
    "deviations at the level of @xmath10 are possible in rare @xmath0 decays @xcite .",
    "this is a property shared also by non - susy mfv models @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 will be the most sensitive probes of susy models with mfv @xcite .    if one allows @xmath8 to be very large , huge effects are possible in @xmath13 @xcite , increasing the br from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , behind the corner of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this large enhancement of @xmath13 is in general correlated to a decrease of the @xmath17 mass difference @xmath18 , cutting out a large part of parameter space @xcite .",
    "once a measurement of @xmath18 becomes available , this correlation will be very useful in determining the prediction for @xmath13 in this model .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that , in minimal supergravity models , a correlation can be established between contributions to @xmath13 and @xmath19 . in the region of parameter space favoured by the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon",
    ", one can obtain enhancements of one or two orders of magnitude of @xmath20 over the sm prediction @xcite .",
    "we now turn from mfv to susy models with arbitrary sfermion mass matrices . in general , fcnc and cp - violating processes impose stringent constraints on off - diagonal sfermion mass terms @xcite . to study these models in full generality , it is convenient to parameterize fcnc amplitudes in terms of @xmath21 , the ratio of the off - diagonal squark mass term @xmath22 connecting squarks of flavour @xmath23 and @xmath24 and helicities @xmath25 and @xmath0 over the average squark mass @xmath26 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath27 , the mass insertion that induces @xmath28 transitions .",
    "constraints on this parameter from the @xmath29 mass difference @xmath30 and from the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath31 decays @xmath32 have been recently studied in  @xcite .",
    "this analysis includes nlo qcd corrections @xcite and lattice matrix elements @xcite . as an example of the constraints one obtains from this kind of analysis , i report in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs ] the allowed regions in the abs@xmath33  arg@xmath33 plane @xmath34 , for @xmath35 gev . other results and details of the analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis including also chargino contributions has been very recently carried out in  @xcite .",
    "effects of @xmath36 can also be tested using @xmath37 decays @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a similar analysis can be carried out for @xmath38 , the mass insertions that generate @xmath39 transitions @xcite . in this case , however , at present we only have a lower bound on @xmath18 and the precise measurement of @xmath40 .",
    "the latter quantity is very effective in constraining @xmath41 , while its impact on @xmath42 is quite limited . in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs ] i report preliminary results on the allowed regions in the re@xmath38  im@xmath38 plane , for @xmath43 , for the present lower bound @xmath44 ps@xmath45 . to illustrate the possible impact of a future measurement of @xmath18 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs ] i also report the allowed regions for @xmath46 ps@xmath47 ps@xmath45 and @xmath48 ps@xmath49 ps@xmath45 .",
    "while the constraints on @xmath41 are completely dominated by @xmath50 , one can see clearly that a measurement of @xmath18 will drastically reduce the allowed values of @xmath42 . however , given the errors on hadronic matrix elements , the allowed range for @xmath42 can not shrink too much when the experimental error on @xmath18 is reduced .",
    "clearly , @xmath38 enter many other interesting @xmath51 decays .",
    "let us first consider @xmath52 .",
    "the first measurements of @xmath53 by the babar and belle collaborations display a @xmath54 deviation from the observed value of @xmath55 @xcite , while in the sm both quantities should measure @xmath56 with negligible hadronic uncertainties @xcite ( here @xmath57 is one of the angles of the ut ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs ] i report @xmath58 ( the coefficient of the @xmath59 term in @xmath53 ) as a function of @xmath42 for different values of @xmath18 @xcite . at present",
    ", susy effects can account for the observed central value , but this may change with future data on @xmath18 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that direct cp violation can also occur in this channel @xcite .",
    "another interesting process in which effects of @xmath38 can be seen is @xmath60 . here",
    "large deviations from the sm in the asymmetries can be generated even for values of the br close to the sm expectations @xcite .",
    "for reasons of space , in this talk i was able to discuss only a few of the many interesting implications of susy in @xmath0 physics .",
    "however , already from these selected topics it is clear that the richer the flavour structure of superpartners is , the more probable it is to discover indirect signs of susy in @xmath0 physics . in any case , forthcoming data in this field will certainly help us learn more on susy extensions of the sm .",
