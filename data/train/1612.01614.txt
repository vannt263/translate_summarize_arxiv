    "the availability of three - dimensional asteroid shapes allows for computation of observed surface area .",
    "this computation is routinely done for objects observed by radar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 7 ) , as well as resolved spacecraft observations of asteroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) .",
    "however , less consideration has been given to the fraction of surface observed in the infrared when the asteroid itself is not resolved .",
    "unresolved observations of asteroids are an integrated sum of flux from the surface of an asteroid visible to the observer .",
    "the power radiated from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of temperature ; consequently , a small fraction of surface area can contribute the majority of power emitted .",
    "therefore , infrared observations of asteroids are often sensitive to only a small patch of surface area .",
    "additionally , the size of this patch is dependent on the average surface thermal inertia and the wavelengths used for observation .    with the rapid accumulation of thermal - ir observations of small bodies ,",

    "recent growth is partly motivated by a desire to employ the wealth of infrared measurements of asteroids made by surveys such as iras @xcite , neowise @xcite , and akari @xcite which have observed hundreds of thousands of asteroids as point sources .",
    "previous thermal models , such as the near - earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are effective for measuring diameters and albedos but include many assumptions , including a spherical , non - rotating body with zero emission from the night side of the object .",
    "the fast - rotating model ( frm ) assumes a spherical object with latitudinal bands of uniform temperature and @xmath0 obliquity .",
    "thermophysical models aim to more accurately model asteroids by computing heat transport and including additional data such as radar - derived shapes and spin poles , they are separate from and more computationally intensive than neatm or frm .",
    "thermophysical models generally incorporate the effects of small - scale surface roughness .    the influence of shape on thermal modeling has also been investigated .",
    "* see figure 5 ) compared the temperature distribution for ( 6489 ) golevka with the temperature distribution produced by a simplified model .",
    "@xcite investigated how uncertainty in shape model and spin orientation impact thermophysical modeling results .    to facilitate thermophysical modeling of unresolved point sources",
    ", we quantified the observed area for two modeled asteroid shapes over a range of parameters .",
    "these results offer insight into the difference between the part of the surface that is visible , geometrically , to the telescope , and the part of the surface that contributes to the observed infrared flux .",
    "a useful metric for describing the thermal environment of a rotating body is the unit - less thermal parameter , @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath4 is the density , @xmath5 is the heat capacity , @xmath6 is the body s angular rotation rate , @xmath7 is the emissivity , @xmath8 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath9 is the sub - solar temperature of the surface .",
    "this can be rewritten in terms of thermal inertia @xmath10 as @xmath11 as objects move farther away from the sun , @xmath9 decreases , causing @xmath1 to increase .",
    "the @xmath1 of an object is independent of diameter .",
    "when the surface of the body is in equilibrium with the incident radiation , @xmath12 .",
    "objects with low @xmath1 are often referred to as ",
    "slow rotators \" , as heat is conducted and re - emitted quickly relative to the rotation rate . a body with uniform surface temperature would have @xmath1 approaching infinity , and objects with high @xmath1 are termed  fast rotators \" ( spencer et al . ,",
    "in other words , @xmath1 is the ratio of an effective thermal conductivity due to conduction to the thermal emission due to radiation .",
    "another relevant parameter is the unit - less x value , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath15 is the frequency , and @xmath16 is planck s constant .",
    "although the emitted power from the surface is proportional to the fourth power of temperature , the x value expresses the emitted brightness at a given band .",
    "individual bands probing the rayleigh - jeans side of the blackbody will be less sensitive to temperature variations than bands probing the wein s approximation side of the curve .",
    "the x value is calculated for the resulting models , with @xmath9 taken to be the peak temperature ( the highest temperature on the surface ) and @xmath15 corresponding to the frequency of the neowise @xmath17 @xmath18 band .",
    "we modeled two asteroid shapes for a range of @xmath1 , and calculated the surface areas that contributed @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the observed flux .",
    "one shape was a sphere with 800 triangular facets , generated with code based on that of @xcite and implemented as described in @xcite .",
    "the other shape was a radar - derived 1996-facet shape of ( 4486 ) mithra derived assuming prograde rotation from @xcite .",
    "this calculation is representative of dog bone or dumbbell - shaped asteroids , and temperature is calculated at 1 au from the sun and with @xmath0 obliquity .",
    "therefore , the results shown here are not reflective of the actual temperatures on 4486 mithra , which has a non - zero obliquity , a 0.6 orbital eccentricity , and has an orbital semimajor axis of 2.2 au .",
    "calculations assumed a visible geometric albedo of 0.2 , and zero obliquity .",
    "heat capacity was set at 500 j kg@xmath21 k@xmath21 , thermal conductivity at 0.1 w m@xmath21 k@xmath21 , and density at 2000 kg m@xmath22 , roughly following values measured by @xcite for ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "the effects of small - scale surface roughness decrease as @xmath1 increases @xcite , and depend on wavelength @xcite .",
    "we modeled roughness via the effective infrared emissivity , following the statistical treatment of roughness described in @xcite which examined the main - belt asteroid ( 2867 ) steins .",
    "there the authors invoke the self - heating parameter @xmath23 of @xcite and employ the visible phase curves of steins to determine an effective emissivity , @xmath24 , for that object . in this work , the effects of roughness were modeled by testing @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as well as a case without roughness with @xmath27 .",
    "emissivity of 0.9 follows typical values found for meteorites @xcite .    to change @xmath1",
    ", the rotation period was varied between 0.001 and 1000.0 hours in logarithmic steps , while @xmath10 was held constant . however ,",
    "this choice was arbitrary ; identical results could be obtained by varying @xmath10 while maintaining a fixed rotation period .",
    "resulting @xmath1 ranged between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the spherical asteroid had a diameter of 100 meters , though we note again that since @xmath1 is independent of diameter , the results do not depend on diameter and are valid for the sizes of known asteroids .",
    "( the usefulness of @xmath1 breaks down at pathological extremes , where the thermal depth wave is on the order of the size of the body , such as for cometary dust grains ) .",
    "the asteroid was placed at 1 au from the sun , on a circular orbit .",
    "observed fraction was calculated both at opposition and at @xmath30 phase angle .",
    "observed fraction was taken to be the number of facets that contributed @xmath19 of the flux divided by half the total number of facets .    to calculate heat transport through the body , we employed sinda , a three - dimensional heat transfer code used across a variety of disciplines , including manufacturing engineering and spacecraft design @xcite .",
    "the object underwent a warm up phase to allow interior temperatures to equilibrate before final surface temperatures were calculated ; equilibration was defined as when the total flux of the asteroid changed by less than @xmath31 .",
    "self - shadowing and self - heating were both calculated , assuming lambertian reflection . from the resultant temperature maps , thermal emission and reflected sunlight was calculated for each facet .",
    "maps showing the observed surface area as a function of @xmath1 are given in figures [ fig : maps ] and [ fig : mithra ] .",
    "these maps are for the case without surface roughness ; maps of results including roughness are similar .",
    "temperature maps and surface area contributing @xmath19 and @xmath20 of observed light in the thermally emitted ir at 12 @xmath32 m are shown .",
    "maps of observed reflected visible wavelength sunlight at opposition and at 90@xmath33 phase angle illustrate geometric viewing effects for reference . the amount of reflected light depends on the cosine of the normal facet angle and the vector toward the sun as well as the cosine of the normal facet angle and the vector to the observer .",
    "maps of observed thermally emitted light depend on both the temperature of the facet , and the cosine of the normal facet angle and the vector to the observer .",
    "for the case of @xmath34 , temperature is uniform with longitude , with a hot equatorial band . for a spherical object , the observed area in the infrared does not change based on viewing angle .",
    "the yellow region , which as a whole contributes to @xmath19 of the emitted thermal flux , extends over this hot region , excluding the cold pole .",
    "this case is a classic `` fast rotator '' , and could be accurately modeled using the frm .",
    "as @xmath1 decreases , the sub - solar hotspot becomes more pronounced . for a sphere observed at opposition",
    ", a smaller area contributes to @xmath19 of the infrared flux as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "observed at 90@xmath33 phase angle , a slightly larger fraction of the surface is observed in the ir vs the visible when @xmath35 , though overall flux will be lower due to colder observed area .",
    "when @xmath36 , the nightside emission is effectively zero , and the temperature distribution resembles neatm model .    for a dumbbell shaped asteroid ( figure [ fig : mithra ] ) , the irregular surface of this object means that the observed surface area in the infrared ( yellow ) is fragmented , indicating sensitivity to facet orientation .",
    "this fragmentation is apparent at all values of @xmath1 , particularly when compared to the observed area in visible wavelengths ( reflected light , white ) .",
    "sub - figure [ fig : mithra](c ) illustrates a low @xmath1 or slow rotating case . when observed at @xmath30 phase angle , a small fraction of the surface produces @xmath19 of the observed infrared flux .",
    "thermal flux is not only sensitive to the orientation of each facet , but it is dependent on only a small fraction of facets .",
    "the fraction of observed surface area in the ir varies as a function of @xmath1 and wavelength .",
    "observing the spherical object at opposition , @xmath37 to @xmath38 of the surface contributes @xmath19 of the observed flux at @xmath39 . for the dumbbell shaped object",
    ", only @xmath40 to @xmath41 of the surface contributes @xmath19 of the observed flux at @xmath39 .",
    "the fraction of observed surface is not sensitive to roughness when viewed at opposition , however when observed at 90 degrees phase angle , observed area decreases ( by @xmath42 ) as @xmath43 decreases .",
    "figure [ fig : lag ] illustrates the behavior of the hot spot on the asteroids . for a spherical asteroid in the case of high @xmath1 , temperature is uniform with respect to longitude , and no hot spot exists . for @xmath1 = @xmath44 , a hot spot exists , and it is significantly shifted away from @xmath45 due to thermal lag .",
    "this shift is responsible for powering the diurnal yarkovsky effect @xcite . for cases of @xmath46 ,",
    "the asteroid is heating and cooling quickly relative to its rotation rate , and the hotspot is located close to the sub solar point .",
    "the technique of determining an asteroid s spin sense ( prograde vs retrograde ) based on comparison of flux emitting from each side of the sub solar point ( morning vs. afternoon observations ) therefore is limited to a range of @xmath1 of order 10 for this simple case , and may exclude slow rotating bodies with highly thermally insulating surfaces , fast spinners , or metallic objects with efficient thermal conduction . additionally , even for optimal values of @xmath1 , afternoon flux excess is @xmath47 of the flux at the sub solar point , while morning flux deficit is @xmath48 of the flux at the sub solar point .",
    "implementation of this technique requires observations with sufficiently high signal to noise .",
    "the location of the hot spot on the surface of the asteroid is related to the diurnal yarkovsky effect .",
    "although figure [ fig : lag ] illustrates how displacement is largest on spherical asteroids with @xmath1 of order 10 , this figure is also normalized to sub solar flux . for predictions of thermal force as a function of @xmath1 ,",
    "see @xcite , which predicts a peak when @xmath49 .    for",
    "the dumbbell shaped asteroid , shape effects introduce complications . for a fast - rotating object",
    "( @xmath1 = @xmath28 ) , an increase of thermal flux compared to the sub solar point can be observed on either side of the sub - solar point , depending on the rotational phase of the asteroid .",
    "therefore , comparison of morning vs afternoon thermal flux for a fast rotator can not indicate rotation sense .",
    "although this is not a surprising result , fast - rotating cases must be identified and excluded from samples before a rotation sense analysis can be conducted . for this case ,",
    "rotation sense could be determined during some , but not all , rotational phases when @xmath46 , given observations with sufficiently high signal to noise .    .",
    "thermal lag is only present for a limited range of @xmath1 . for @xmath50 afternoon flux excess",
    "is @xmath47 of the flux at the sub solar point , while morning flux deficit is @xmath48 of the flux at the sub solar point .",
    "( b ) dumbbell shaped object , case without roughness . since the observed w3 flux varies with rotation for this object , five lines for each value of @xmath1 are plotted , each assuming a different rotation phase .",
    "[ fig : lag ]",
    "when solving for the temperature of an asteroid during thermophysical modeling , an observed area should also be calculated .",
    "this is a computationally simple step that ensures that results may be interpreted accurately",
    ". published radar - based shape models have figures that illustrate which part of the derived shape was fit to the radar data , and which parts were filled in by the inversion software . since thermophysical modeling is sensitive to the orientation of each facet , best results will be produced when the observed area in the infrared corresponds with the area of the shape that was observed by radar .",
    "additionally , for thermophysical modeling , shape models can be effectively employed only if their spatial resolution is smaller than the area observed in the thermal infrared , which varies with @xmath1 .",
    "although telescopic images in the ir are not disk - resolved , they can be paired with an asteroid shape model of sufficiently high resolution to determine what areas of the asteroid are producing the flux observed . for example , case ( c ) in figure [ fig : mithra ] shows that only the limb of the asteroid is imaged in the infrared at @xmath30 phase angle . if an infrared light curve with sufficiently high signal to noise was obtained for this object , shape effects could be removed , and thermal inertia could be solved for at each of the different rotation phases . combined with observed surface maps , the thermal inertias for each rotation phase could produce a rough map of thermal inertia .",
    "neatm and frm have been used to return reliable diameters and albedos . for values of @xmath1 comparable with the majority of asteroids , they produce temperature distributions that closely match thermophysically - derived distributions .",
    "diameters have been verified by independent methods such as radar and stellar occultations , e.g. @xcite .",
    "although this type of modeling contains simplifying assumptions , the impacts of these assumptions are accounted for by the associated statistical uncertainties obtained when averaging over many objects ( @xmath51 to @xmath52 @xmath53 in diameter in the literature referenced previously , depending on data used ) .",
    "as the number of asteroids observed by radar has been rapidly growing , future work will compare neatm - derived diameters to radar - derived diameters using a larger sample .",
    "we thank the referee for their thoughtful comments that strengthened the manuscript ."
