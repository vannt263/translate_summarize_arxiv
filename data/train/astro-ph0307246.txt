    "lkca  15 , located in the taurus - auriga complex at a distance of 140 pc , is rapidly becoming one of the best studied t tauri stars at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "a k5 star with an optical / near - infrared luminosity of @xmath40.8 l@xmath9 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , lkca  15 is well isolated from dark clouds and lacks any detectable reflection nebulosity in hst wfpc2 images ( @xcite ) .",
    "its substantial near- through far - infrared excess is consistent with the presence of a circumstellar disk ( @xcite ) whose mass and radial extent have been determined by recent spectral energy distribution fits and millimeter - wave interferometric observations to be some 0.024 m@xmath9 and 650 au , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "age estimates for lkca  15 range from 3 myr ( @xcite ) to 12 myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "these time scales are similar to those suggested for the disappearance of small dust grains in the inner regions of circumstellar disks ( @xcite ) and for the differentiation of meteoritic material in the early solar nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large size and mass of the disk , combined with the age of lkca 15 , make this an important system for further study since it may represent an important transitional phase in which viscous disk spreading and dispersal competes with planetary formation processes .",
    "further , the outer disk can be studied in detail with existing ( sub)millimeter - wave telescopes .",
    "single dish observations have already revealed readily detectable emission from several molecules ( @xcite ) , while aperture synthesis imaging has the potential to shed light on the chemical and physical gradients in the disk .",
    "our initial millimeter - wave observations of lkca  15 have concentrated on species that are typically abundant in dense molecular clouds .",
    "here we present owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array observations of the disk encircling lkca  15 in dust continuum emission and the lowest rotational transitions of various isotopologues of co and hco@xmath3 .",
    "an upper limit to the emission from the h@xmath2co@xmath3 ion is noted .",
    "n@xmath6h@xmath3 was also observed to constrain the fractional ionization and molecular depletion beyond 100 au . due to the limited angular extent of the disk ,",
    "small scale gradients were largely smoothed out by the spatial resolution achieved , and the resultant line intensities should be considered as an `` average '' over the outer disk .",
    "nevertheless , these interferometric observations suffer from substantially less beam - dilution than those with single telescopes ; and this , combined with the inherent stability of cross - correlation measurements , provides a powerful means of studying the weak emission from species such as n@xmath6h@xmath3 and c@xmath5o . while arrays under development will provide substantially improved sensitivity and spatial resolution , observations at the few arcsecond level form the first and necessary step to understanding depletion and ionization within the disks of t tauri stars .",
    "future publications will present more detailed analyses of these and other data acquired in an extensive millimeter - wave interferometric spectral line survey of lkca  15 ( @xcite ) . in",
    "what follows ,  2 includes a brief overview of the observations , while in  3 we discuss the results and the important effects of gas - phase depletion and fractional ionization on the physical and chemical structure of the disk around lkca  15 .",
    "a brief summary of our results and the role of future observations may be found in  4 .",
    "all measurements were made between 1997 october and 2000 april using the ovro millimeter array at big pine , california .",
    "the array consists of six 10.4 meter telescopes with an rms surface precision of 35 microns .",
    "the pointing accuracy is about 4@xmath10 , except for brief excursions at sunrise and sunset .",
    "combinations of five array configurations were used to map lkca  15 , with antenna spacings ranging from 20 to 400 m east - west and from 25 to 440 m north - south .",
    "cryogenic sis receivers on each telescope produced average single sideband system temperatures of 450 , 1300 , and 1200 k at the frequencies of the @xmath2co 1@xmath70 , co 1@xmath70 , and co 2@xmath71 lines , respectively .",
    "the receivers were tuned for double sideband operation so that both the upper and lower sidebands could be used for molecular line studies .",
    "the receiver if output is sent over fiber optic transmission lines to a pair of 1 ghz bandwidth analog correlators and a 512 lag digital correlator with four separately configurable modules .",
    "spectral line and continuum measurements are made simultaneously and can be carried out in both the @xmath11 = 3 and 1.3 mm atmospheric windows with a single local oscillator set up . during the @xmath2co 1@xmath70 and hco@xmath3 1@xmath70 observations of lkca  15",
    ", the digital correlator was configured into two bands of 64 @xmath12 0.125 mhz channels to provide a velocity resolution of 0.17 and 0.21 km s@xmath13 , while the co 2@xmath71 measurements were made using 256 @xmath12 0.125 mhz channels for a velocity resolution of 0.16 km s@xmath13 .",
    "calibration of the visibility phases and amplitudes was achieved with observations of the quasars 0528 + 134 and 0507 + 179 , typically at intervals of 2030 minutes .",
    "measurements of uranus , neptune , 3c 273 and 3c 454.3 provided an absolute scale for the calibration of flux densities .",
    "all data were phase- and amplitude - calibrated using the mma software package , developed specifically for ovro ( @xcite ) .",
    "continuum and spectral line maps were generated and cleaned using the nrao aips package .",
    "the continuum level is not subtracted in obtaining the line maps because most of the transitions observed here are optically thick whereas the continuum is optically thin .",
    "uncertainties in the fluxes and source positions are estimated to be 20% and 0.@xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the synthesized beams vary from 1@xmath10 at 1.2 mm to 4@xmath10 at 3.4 mm .",
    "figure  [ fig : continuum ] shows the spectral energy distribution of the continuum emission from lkca  15 .",
    "a noticeable , but at present poorly constrained , decrease in the continuum spectral slope with frequency has been found , as discussed further in  3.1 .",
    "the dust emission is spatially resolved , but only in the highest resolution ovro 1.2 mm images .",
    "the ( @xmath14)-plane fits of a two - dimensional gaussian to the highest quality visibilities yield a deconvolved size of @xmath15 at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath16 , which corresponds to a minimum size of the dust disk of @xmath17 au . assuming the disk is circular",
    ", the measured ellipticity indicates an inclination angle of @xmath18 ( 0@xmath19 being the inclination of a face - on disk ) .",
    "this inclination is somewhat larger than the value obtained by @xcite , 34@xmath19 , but smaller than the value of 66@xmath19 obtained by @xcite with their nma 2 mm continuum observations , probably due to differences in the synthesized beams .",
    "nevertheless , it is in good agreement with both the ovro and plateau de bure measurements of the disk properties as traced by co ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : co ] shows the integrated intensity and intensity - weighted mean velocity maps of the co 2@xmath71 emission toward lkca  15 . as shown in the left panel , the molecular gas emission appears much more extended than the dust .",
    "solid grains no doubt exist at similar radii , but are undetectable due to the more rapid fall - off in dust emissivity ( @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the molecular emission from the innermost region of the disk ( r@xmath2030 - 50 au ) is sufficiently beam diluted even at 1 - 2@xmath10 resolution that no direct information on this size scale can be obtained without further improvements in sensitivity and imaging performance .",
    "the circumstellar gas emission is an effective tracer of the line - of - sight velocity component of the outer disk via doppler shifts , as is shown by the intensity - weighted mean gas velocity map in figure 2 ( right panel ) .",
    "molecular gas southwest ( sw ) of the star is blue - shifted , whereas that to the northeast ( ne ) is red - shifted , consistent with gas orbiting in a disk inclined with respect to the plane of the sky . with a beam size of @xmath42@xmath10 ( or 280 au ) , the ovro co 2@xmath71 image of the lkca  15 disk is well resolved .",
    "a gaussian fit to the velocity - integrated co intensity map ( figure  [ fig : co ] ) results in a fwhm of @xmath21 at a position angle of 68@xmath19 , which corresponds to a radius of 300 au .    at such moderately large inclinations",
    "shear broadening exceeds thermal broadening in the spectrum , and the local emissivity of optically thin lines becomes anisotropic ( @xcite ) . in this case , the separation of the two peaks in the co 2@xmath71 spectrum ( 2.6 km s@xmath13 , see figure  [ fig : co_spectra ] ) becomes 2v@xmath22sin@xmath23 , where v@xmath22 is the doppler shift due to the keplerian orbital motion , or @xmath24 , indicating @xmath25313 au . in figure",
    "[ fig : cochan ] , observed maps on velocity channels of width 0.65 km s@xmath13 are compared with synthetic maps generated by a detailed model of a disk in keplerian rotation .",
    "following @xcite(see also @xcite ) , the model used a two - component gaussian emissivity distribution with half - maximum radii taken from the fit to the integrated intensity map in figure  [ fig : co ] .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath23 , outer cut - off radius @xmath25 , and relative amplitudes of the gaussian components were varied to match the structure in figure  [ fig : cochan ] .",
    "best fits were found for a central mass @xmath26 and disk inclination of @xmath27 .",
    "the outer gaussian component has a hwhm of 425 au and a cut - off radius of 750 au .",
    "these values are in good agreement with optical and infrared photometry ( @xcite ) , pdbi co observations ( @xcite ) and with our resolved 1.2 mm continuum observations .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : cochan ] , synthetic maps produced from this model agree very well with the co j=2@xmath71 spectral line maps of lkca  15 .",
    "the size of the gas disk is thus well determined both from the image and the spectral data cube , and is much larger than the dust disk size as determined from continuum emission . in",
    "what follows , important disk physical properties are fixed at the values derived from the dust ( disk mass ) and co ( disk size and orientation ) emission .    for robust measurements of the abundance and excitation of co ,",
    "it is necessary to derive observational estimates of line opacities .",
    "these can be obtained by examining a range of transitions and isotopologues .",
    "visibilities from several configurations were therefore combined to examine the @xmath2co , c@xmath5o , hco@xmath3 , and n@xmath6h@xmath3 j=1@xmath70 transitions ; results are presented in figure  [ fig : molecules ] and figure  [ fig : molecules_spectra ] .",
    "the velocity patterns observed in both @xmath2co and hco@xmath3 are entirely consistent with those seen in co , with red - shifted emission to the ne and blue - shifted emission to the sw .",
    "the c@xmath5o and n@xmath6h@xmath3 1@xmath70 data cubes have lower signal - to - noise values , and so no velocity analysis was carried out for these transitions .",
    "the integrated line intensities and the corresponding column densities for the above transitions were derived with the assumptions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and optically thin emission at an excitation temperature of 30 k as presented in table  [ tab : mol ] .",
    "only upper limits have been obtained for h@xmath2co@xmath3 .",
    "two of the most important global properties of a disk are its mass and temperature distribution . at sufficiently short wavelengths ,",
    "the entire disk is optically thick , and the density distribution does not affect the emission . at wavelengths longer than about 300 @xmath28 m , however , the thermal emission from circumstellar disks becomes optically thin .",
    "thus , continuum observations at millimeter wavelengths provide an excellent way to measure disk masses directly via the equation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is flux density , @xmath32 is the mass opacity , @xmath33 is the surface density and @xmath34 is the surface area of the disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dust temperatures t are almost always sufficiently high ( typically 50 k ) to make the rayleigh - jeans assumption valid , so the total emission is proportional to a product of the total mass and the average temperature @xmath35 , weighted appropriately by its radial distribution .",
    "the major uncertainty in mass estimates arises from @xmath32 .",
    "theoretically , @xmath32 is expected to vary as a power of the frequency @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath38 @xmath39g@xmath13 and calculate the total gas mass assuming @xmath40 .",
    "the disk mass of lkca  15 is calculated to be @xmath40.01 m@xmath9 .",
    "more detailed constraints for the density and temperature structure can be derived by fitting the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of young star / disk systems .",
    "figure  [ fig : continuum ] shows the flux density as a function of frequency of the millimeter wavelength emission from lkca  15 . because the continuum and molecular lines were observed simultaneously , the frequencies of the continuum observations at 1.3 and 2.7 mm vary slightly depending on the local oscillator frequency required for the molecular line observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : continuum ] , the spectral index , @xmath41 , as defined by @xmath42 , is 2.65 , consistent with iram pdbi observations ( @xcite ) . a separate analysis of the data in each atmospheric window ,",
    "however , suggests that the slope of the 3 mm points alone ( @xmath43 ) is considerably steeper than that for the 1.3 mm fluxes ( @xmath44 ) , although the error bars are large .    in order to examine this issue further",
    ", we compare our ovro 3.4  1.2 mm continuum fluxes with those obtained at 870 @xmath28 m and 7 mm by the jcmt and vla , respectively .",
    "the jcmt scuba flux lies along a spectral index @xmath41 of 2.65 with respect to the ovro data , and so is consistent with the local slope derived from the ovro 1.3 mm continuum emission measurements .",
    "no simple extrapolation of the sub - millimeter data can explain the vla non - detection at 7 mm ( d. wilner , private communication ) , which requires @xmath41 values similar to or even larger than those measured at 3 mm .",
    "the coincidence of the 1.3 and 3 mm data observed by @xcite with the fits to our ovro data indicate that the observed change in the spectral index at millimeter wavelengths is not likely to be due to errors in flux calibration .",
    "several physical mechanisms , notably optical depth effects and grain growth , can contribute to the observed behavior .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath45 is expected to vary as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the opacity index .",
    "assuming optically thin emission in the rayleigh - jeans limit , the opacity index @xmath48 ( = @xmath49 ) varies from 1.51 to 0.34 for the lkca 15 disk , while @xmath48 is approximately 2 for dust in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "how reasonable is this assumption of optically thin continuum emission ?",
    "following @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ratio of optically thick to optically thin emission and depends on the disk structure , @xmath52 is the average optical depth at frequency @xmath36 , and @xmath53 is the mass of the disk . given the dust disk radius of 190 au and an @xmath53 of 0.01 m@xmath9 ( derived above from f@xmath54 ) , the average optical depth at 230 ghz is 0.03 .",
    "thus , for any reasonable disk density and temperature distribution , the optical depth correction does not appear to be sufficient to explain the observed change in the lkca  15 spectral index with a single @xmath48 .",
    "one means to solve this dilemma is for the mass opacity coefficient @xmath55 to decrease by nearly an order of magnitude between 1.2 and 3.4 mm .",
    "recent detailed models of irradiated t tauri disks , including dust grain growth ( @xcite ) , conclude that when grains grow from @xmath28 m to mm sizes , the mass opacity coefficient @xmath45 changes significantly between 1.3 and 3 mm .",
    "indeed , observations of circumstellar disks ( @xcite ) indicate typical values of beta around 0.3 , similar to that expected from mm - sized pebbles ( @xmath56 ) , as opposed to the steeper frequency dependence of @xmath45 ( @xmath57 ) found in the general interstellar medium ( @xcite ) .    as indicated by @xcite , the disk mass and grain size distribution can not be uniquely constrained by the continuum sed alone when only unresolved fluxes are available .",
    "additionally , @xcite find that for a given total dust mass , grain growth is accompanied by a decrease in the vertical height of the disk surface .",
    "fits of the sed for lkca  15 ( @xcite ) indicate that the ratio of the height of the disk photosphere ( h ) to the vertical gas scale height ( h ) is small ( 1.0 ) , which can be interpreted as evidence that the dust has begun to settle vertically toward the midplane .",
    "the h / h parameter is a rather robust one within the confines of the model , for as h / h decreases from 4 to 1 there is an corresponding decrease in the overall level of infrared excess at @xmath58100 @xmath28 m since the disk intercepts less stellar radiation .",
    "dust settling can help explain the relative paucity of large disks to which the powerful technique of scattered light coronography can be applied and specifically the lack of any detectable reflection nebulosity in hst wfpc2gto observations of lkca  15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the most likely explanation for the observed change in the spectral index from 1 mm to 3 mm is a combination of grain growth and dust settling .",
    "the observed line intensities in circumstellar disks are a complex function of the physical structure of the disk and of the line / continuum optical depth . if we assume that circumstellar disk abundances are similar to those found in dark clouds , the emission lines from parent isotopologues of common species such as co , hco@xmath3 , hcn , etc .",
    ", should be highly optically thick",
    ". our observed ratios of @xmath59co/@xmath2co emission reveal that @xmath59co is indeed optically thick , but say little about @xmath2co .",
    "several lkca  15 transits were therefore devoted to a local oscillator setting containing the c@xmath5o j=1 @xmath7 0 transition , the results of which are presented in figure  [ fig : molecules ] . the observed beam - matched flux density ratio is 5 , only somewhat lower than the isotope ratio [ @xmath2c]/[@xmath5o ] of 8.3 .",
    "the @xmath2co j=1 @xmath7 0 transition is therefore only somewhat optically thick , and that of c@xmath5o is optically thin , and should therefore provide a more reliable estimate of the disk mass , _ provided _ it remains in the gas phase .",
    "@xcite indicate that , for standard hco@xmath3 abundances , the 1@xmath70 line is again optically thick in the outer layers , whereas that of h@xmath2co@xmath3 is close to being optically thin throughout the disk .",
    "further , the low - j hco@xmath3 lines are predicted to probe densities of order @xmath60 @xmath61 , below the critical density of the 4@xmath73 transition ( so that lte can not be safely assumed ) . for h@xmath2co@xmath3",
    ", the populations will be closer to thermal equilibrium because its emission arises primarily from regions with densities of @xmath62 @xmath61 ( @xcite ) .",
    "parent isotopologue lines are therefore likely to be optically thick for many species in disks , and so whenever possible the emission from isotopically substituted species should be utilized in deriving relative molecular abundances .",
    "the observations described above indicate the need for detailed calculation of disk radiative transfer .",
    "furthermore , the complex geometry within the disk demands that flexible and efficient radiative transfer techniques be utilized , and of the many techniques available the monte carlo approach has shown great promise ( @xcite ) .",
    "since monte carlo techniques utilize integration paths chosen at random , any number of coordinate systems can be used .",
    "the high optical depth of many transitions in circumstellar disks generates very short photon mean free paths , however , and so unless aggressive acceleration schemes are employed , the monte carlo approach can be very slow .",
    "computational instabilities and poor convergence can result , but efficient one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) monte carlo treatments of the line radiative transfer based on the two - layer passive disk models outlined above have now begun to appear ( @xcite ) .",
    "in all such approaches , the intensity of each line is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation .",
    "2d implenetations are necessary to quantitatively treat inclined disks . for this reason we have used an accelerated 2d monte carlo model ( @xcite ) to examine the radiative transfer and molecular excitation in the lkca  15 disk , taking both collisional and radiative processes into account .",
    "this model produces a simulated observation of each transition as imaged by a telescope with infinite resolution for a disk of a given size , inclination and temperature distribution .",
    "the miriad function uvmodel and the observed visibility data set were then used to sample this model at the observed @xmath63 spacings and the model data set was processed in a manner identical to that of the ovro data , thus allowing a direct comparison of the two . for these model calculations ,",
    "the temperature and hydrogen density as a function of radius and height were acquired from a model similar to those presented in dalessio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but calculated specifically for the stellar parameters of lkca  15 such that the overall sed of the star+disk is reproduced . in this model ,",
    "we assume spherical , compact dust grains with a power law size distribution with exponent 3.5 , a maximum grain size of 1 mm and grain abundances from pollack et al .",
    "the accretion rate is assumed to be @xmath64 m@xmath9 yr@xmath13 , with the inner radius of the disk set at 5 au and the outer radius at 425  au , which is consistent with that derived above for lkca  15 .",
    "the inclination ( 58 degrees ) and turbulent velocity width ( 0.1 km s@xmath13 ) are found by fitting the observed co 2@xmath71 line profile with the model spectrum , using n@xmath65=10@xmath66n@xmath67   have similar radial and vertical distributions .",
    "chemical models ( i.e. @xcite ) indicate that this is not strictly the case , and variations in the vertical distribution of co will be explored in future work . ] as shown in figure  [ fig : co_spectra ] .",
    "for each transition observed , a suite of models with the parameters described above were created , but with the molecular abundances relative to hydrogen varied until a match with the observed integrated line intensity was obtained .",
    "integrated intensity is a useful quantity for comparison because the column density is approximately constant as a function of radius ( @xcite ) at the large radii ( @xmath68 50 au ) to which we are sensitive with the ovro millimeter array .",
    "the resulting column densities are shown in table  [ tab : mol ] .",
    "the column densities calculated using this non - lte radiative transfer model are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than those calculated in the @xcite models of disk chemistry , but consistent with those calculated by @xcite  except that n@xmath6h@xmath3 is an order of magnitude larger than the model prediction . as indicated in the last column of table  [ tab : mol ] , for co 2@xmath71 , @xmath2co 1@xmath70 , hco@xmath3 1@xmath70 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 1@xmath70 emission the column densities are smaller when calculated using the lte assumption .",
    "this is due to the fact that the emission from these transitions is optically thick ( see discussion above ) .",
    "the lte calculations assume that the gas is optically thin and that the entire disk is being probed by observation of this line emission and thus result in an underestimation of the total amount of co , hco@xmath3 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 present .",
    "in the case of the c@xmath5o 1@xmath70 and h@xmath2co@xmath3 1@xmath70 emission , which are believed to be optically thin , and for the conditions in the near - surface regions of disks beyond 50 au , the column densities are overestimated when thermal equilibrium is assumed .",
    "this supports the conclusion that conditions in the emitting region are not at lte , and that both radiative and collisional processes play a part in the excitation .",
    "the population of higher energy rotational states is thus much lower than would be the case if collisions were dominant ; and the assumption of thermal equilibrium therefore results in an overestimation of the population of the upper states and thus in the total column density , which at lte is directly proportional to the density of the upper state .",
    "both the results presented above and observations of high - j transitions of co , hco@xmath3 , and hcn toward lkca  15 by van zadelhoff el al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that the molecular emission from the major isotopologues is optically thick and that the inferred densities in the region are not sufficient to thermalize all transitions .",
    "the line ratios presented in van zadelhoff el al .",
    "( 2001 ) further indicate temperatures and densities typically associated with warm layers lying above the disk midplane .",
    "additionally , if we ignore depletion of gas phase species onto grains , and assume cosmic fractional abundances for co ( 10@xmath6910@xmath66 n@xmath67 ) and hydrogen column densities of 10@xmath70 @xmath71 , the resulting co column density is an order of magnitude greater than that observed here ( 10@xmath5 @xmath71 ) .",
    "thus , for any disk in which the gas and dust are well mixed and there is no depletion , even species such as c@xmath5o are predicted to be optically thick at molecular cloud abundances .",
    "the low column densities derived here and the high - j / low - j line ratios therefore indicate that the disk midplane ( heights below several tens au ) is not being probed by the observed emission and that the column densities presented in table 1 are only applicable to the warm layers of the disk .",
    "the theory of the ionization balance in molecular clouds and the relevant ion - molecule chemistry has been widely used for determinations of the electron abundances in dense clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical chemical models indicate that ion - molecule reactions are also efficient in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization , cosmic ray ionization and , possibly , x - ray ionization of h@xmath6 rapidly lead to the formation of h@xmath72 , the pivotal species in ion - molecule models of molecular cloud chemistry .",
    "the low proton affinity of h@xmath6 ensures that h@xmath72 , which has no rotational spectrum , will undergo proton transfer reactions with abundant neutral species such as co and n@xmath6",
    ". in disks , gaseous co and n@xmath6 exist in regions well removed from the midplane , where the temperature warms enough for sublimation of these molecules ( t @xmath73 20 - 30 k ) .",
    "the isoelectronic ions hco@xmath3 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 were observed here and can therefore be used to estimate the fractional ionization in the warm layer of the lkca  15 disk .",
    "the volume density in the emitting region can be constrained from line ratios obtained from the results presented here and previous single dish observations of molecules with high dipole moments ( e.g. hco@xmath3 , hcn ) .",
    "an lvg analysis for lkca  15 , performed by van zadelhoff et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , indicates that the lines arise from regions with @xmath74@xmath410@xmath7510@xmath76 @xmath61 .",
    "we use 10@xmath77 @xmath61 as the number density of h@xmath6 in the calculations below , which is also the number density at a height of @xmath4150 au and a radius of 350 au in the dalessio disk model .",
    "the mean kinetic temperatures are less well constrained , but the analysis of multiple transitions of co ( van zadelhoff et al .",
    "2001 ) suggests that t@xmath78@xmath42040 k for lkca  15 .",
    "we therefore adopt a single kinetic temperature of 30 k. also , for the reasons discussed in  3.2 , we use the column densities resulting from the non - lte radiative transfer model summarized in table 1 for all observed species . because h@xmath6 can not be observed directly at millimeter wavelengths , the column density is highly model dependent .",

    "a lower limit to the electron fraction follows directly from the observed hco@xmath3 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 column densities , but can also be obtained more `` locally '' by noting that the right side of equation  [ eq : hco ] must be larger than 0 , or :    @xmath99}{[co]}\\geq \\frac{k_{2}[n_{2}h^{+}]}{k_{e}(hco^{+})[hco^{+}]}\\sim 1 \\times 10^{-3 } \\label{eq : e1}\\ ] ]    the lower limit of the fractional ionization @xmath100 $ ] is therefore 10@xmath8 , given [ co]@xmath410@xmath69 , in the near - surface region of the disk .",
    "this value is fairly high compared to that of cold , dark clouds at @xmath74@xmath410@xmath77 @xmath61 where for example , @xcite obtained fractional ionization of 10@xmath96 in the center of l1544 , and we note that the ionization fraction in lkca  15 may be enhanced relative to other t tauri stars .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey of young stars in taurus ( @xcite ) shows that the probability of the existence of an x - ray source for lkca  15 is 98% and the upper limit for its x - ray luminosity is 4.1@xmath12 10@xmath101 ergs@xmath13 .",
    "ionization from the resulting high - energy radiation may have important effects on the disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high hco@xmath3 abundance and cn / hcn ratio observed ( qi , kessler & blake 2003 ) indicate that lkca  15 could possess similar chemistry to the intense x - ray source tw hya , another sun - like star with strong molecular emission from its attendant disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the ionization rate near the disk surface is important because the electron fraction scales linearly with the ionization rate .",
    "a full 3d calculation of x - ray transport and ionization in axially asymmetric disks has been developed by @xcite using a monte carlo approach .",
    "they calculate the ionization rate at @xmath102 au in a minimum mass solar nebula disk model with l@xmath103 = 10@xmath101 erg s@xmath13 , which can be scaled to other x - ray luminosities and disk radii and is found to be relatively insensitive to changes in disk parameters . scaling their values at @xmath104 au with n(h@xmath6)@xmath410@xmath70 @xmath71 , we calculate an x - ray ionization rate of @xmath410@xmath105 s@xmath13 near the surface of the lkca  15 disk .",
    "this is nearly a factor of ten larger than the galactic cosmic ray ionization rate , and shows that x - rays can play an important role in the disk ionization balance .",
    "the enhanced ionization can drive additional chemical activity , and the inclusion of x - rays within the context of dust settling models developed for lkca  15 may well account for much higher abundances of molecules observed toward this source as compared with the dm tau disk , for which `` standard '' disk chemistry models produce good agreement with observations ( @xcite ) .    by considering the balance of all the molecular ions present in the disk ,",
    "even tighter constraints can be placed on the electron fraction .",
    "we consider two conditions with differing abundances of metal ions , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "when the abundances of metal ions are low , h@xmath106 , hco@xmath3 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 become the major cations within the disk . because hco@xmath3 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 have fractional abundances that are only 10@xmath93 while the lower limit to the electron fraction is closer to 10@xmath8 , h@xmath106 dominates . in this case , the electron abundance can be calculated simply from @xmath100\\simeq ( \\frac{\\zeta } { k_{e}n(h_{2})})^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sim 1.4 \\times 10^{-8}$ ] ( @xcite ) , which yields values similar to that derived above .",
    "however , the high resulting abundance of h@xmath72 drives rapid protonation of co , that is @xmath107[co]\\gg k_{e}(hco^{+})[hco^{+}][e]$ ] , and makes hco@xmath3 balance ( equation  [ eq : hco ] ) impossible within the confines of the simple model .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to examine the contribution of metal ions to the fractional ionization because they are destroyed very slowly and can comprise a significant fraction of the ion abundance even though their elemental abundances are small .",
    "@xcite calculate the ionization fraction of protostellar disks , taking into account vertical temperature structure and the possible presence of trace metal atoms , and find that a tiny fraction of the cosmically available metals can dramatically affect the ionization balance .",
    "considering the model above , but now with @xmath108+[hco^+]+[n_2h^+]{\\ll}[e]$ ] , we can solve for the 3 unknown variables @xmath109 $ ] , @xmath110 $ ] and @xmath100 $ ] in order to balance equations  [ eq : hco],[eq : h3],[eq : n2h ] .",
    "using equations  [ eq : h3 ] and [ eq : n2h ] , removing the term @xmath111[h_{3}^{+}]$ ] , and inserting the value of h@xmath112 derived from the equation  [ eq : hco ] , the equation for @xmath100 $ ] becomes : @xmath113[e]^{2}+b[e]-\\frac{\\zeta } { n(h_{2})}k_{1}[co]=0 \\label{eq : e}\\ ] ] where @xmath114[n_{2}h^{+}]+k_{1}k_{e}(hco^{+})[co][hco^{+}]+k_{1}k_{e}(n_{2}h^{+})[co][n_{2}h^{+}]$ ] .",
    "this equation can be solved using the observed column densities of co , hco@xmath3 , and n@xmath6h@xmath3 and an assumed density of h@xmath6 .",
    "the n@xmath6/co ratio can also be derived from equations  [ eq : n2h ] and [ eq : e ] under such conditions , and figure  [ fig : ions_model ] presents the solutions for a range of h@xmath6 column densities . not surprisingly , the electron fraction is calculated to be larger than the metal free case ( @xmath410@xmath8 ) , which , as we stress above , can only be applied for the physical conditions prevailing near the warm surface layer(s ) of the disk .",
    "transport processes in the outer disk likely depend critically on the degree of ionization .",
    "efficient coupling between the neutral material and magnetic fields is thought to be provided by fractional ionizations of @xmath115 ( @xcite ) .",
    "as we have outlined above , photons , x - rays and cosmic rays can be important sources of ionization near the disk surface .",
    "the photon penetration depth is very short compared to the disk thickness , however , and even cosmic rays are exponentially attenuated for columns @xmath68100 g @xmath71 . the electron fraction can therefore be expected to drop toward the midplane due to the increasing density , suggesting the possibility of layered accretion ( @xcite ) , with a turbulent surface layer .",
    "however , due to the depletion of volatiles such as co , the disk mid - plane fractional ionization may be larger than expected from a direct extrapolation of the electron abundance inferred for the surface layer . for very high depletions ,",
    "electron recombination begins to control the fractional abundance of h@xmath72 , resulting in a higher than expected electron ( and h@xmath72 ) abundance .",
    "the details of the vertical and radial ionization fraction are pivotal to magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models of yso accretion disk viscous transport mechanisms ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , for example , propose that differential rotation drives instabilities in the perpendicular magnetic field of accretion disks .",
    "such magnetorotational instabilities then create a turbulent disk if they are well coupled to the neutral disk material . as shown above",
    ", observations suggest that the combination of photons , x - rays , and cosmic rays can produce the ionization needed to couple the magnetic field to the neutral disk material near the disk surface .",
    "chemically , transport or mixing processes between the surface layer and the disk interior would be necessary to bring freshly made molecules such as cn , hcn or even deuterated species back to the interior of the disk . in this scenario ,",
    "the extent of such processes , which are dependent on the ionization fraction , would greatly effect the composition of early solar system objects such as comets .",
    "if co remains primarily in the gas phase , it is sufficiently chemically stable that its abundance will be little altered from dark cloud values .",
    "co would therefore be a good tracer of the disk gas mass , but depletion onto grain mantles in the cold disk is likely to substantially reduce the _ gas phase _ column density of co and many other species .",
    "thus , estimates of the degree of depletion of volatile molecules such as co and n@xmath6 onto grains will greatly improve our understanding of disk chemistry . for co , depletion factors can be measured directly from infrared spectroscopy of edge on disks ( @xcite ) , or more generally by using observations of the dust continuum along with several isotopically - substituted molecules ( e.g. @xmath59co , @xmath2co , c@xmath5o ) to distinguish depletion from optical depth effects . from the column density of co ( @xmath116 @xmath71 )",
    "obtained with the detailed 2d monte carlo radiative transfer model ( table 1 ) , a disk gas mass of only @xmath410@xmath66 m@xmath9 is derived , a value in agreement with that derived from single dish observations of @xmath2co higher - j transitions ( @xcite ) using the jcmt and cso but nearly two orders of magnitude less than the mass derived from dust emission  far more than can be accounted for by errors either in the dust mass opacity coefficient or in the spectral line radiative transfer .",
    "depletion thus appears to be a dominant effect and while co and its isotopomers are therefore excellent tracers of the disk velocity field , it is clear that they are not reliable tracers of the disk mass . in the models of aikawa and co - workers ( @xcite )",
    ", co depletes onto grains at radii greater than 200 - 300 au . inside this radius , the temperature warms to the sublimation temperature of co ( t @xmath4 20 k ) and the gas phase column density rises substantially . if thermal sublimation is the main desorption mechanism , the depletion patterns in disks should be strongly correlated with volatility .",
    "we have observed strong emission from non - volatile species such as hcn and cn toward lkca  15 with spatial distributions that are not well correlated with co ( qi , kessler & blake 2003 ) .",
    "additional mechanisms are therefore likely to be important in maintaining the observed gas - phase abundances .    as a closed shell homonuclear diatomic molecule",
    ", n@xmath6 has no electric dipole allowed rotational transitions and so can not be observed directly at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "however , from our n@xmath6h@xmath3 observations and the model presented above , we can estimate the n@xmath117/co ratio , and find it to be @xmath42 ( figure  [ fig : ions_model ] ) .",
    "this is much higher than the ratios inferred for typical dark clouds at moderate densities , which are @xmath40.010.1 ( @xcite ) . in the dark cloud ic5136",
    ", @xcite do find evidence for the presence of differential gas - phase depletion and altered co / n@xmath6 ratios in the densest portions , where co exhibits a significant abundance reduction and n@xmath6h@xmath3 is relatively undepleted  although in their models the abundance of n@xmath6 is still less than that of co.    within disks , @xcite investigated the two - dimensional chemical structure within the so - called kyoto minimum mass solar nebula model ( @xcite ) , and predicted much lower abundances of n@xmath6 than co at all vertical scales . because they adopted an artificially low sticking probability to reproduce the spectra of co available at that time , without specifying any non - thermal desorption processes or modifying the temperature distribution in the kyoto model ,",
    "such an approach might not account for the known differential desorption of co and n@xmath6 .",
    "further , the vertical temperature gradients of actual protoplanetary disks should be more complex than those in the koyoto model ( @xcite ) . @xcite investigated the molecules in the super - heated layer of the chiang and goldreich ( 1997 ) disk models , and found that molecules in this layer are destroyed by the harsh ultraviolet radiation from the star , although in the warm upper layers of the dalessio et al .",
    "models uv shielding is sufficient to prevent destruction of most molecules ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore believe that n@xmath6 and its chemical product n@xmath6h@xmath3 trace dense gas in the disk where co is largely depleted but n@xmath6 is not , and that this region is protected by an overlying warm layer that protects n@xmath6 from ultraviolet radiation , in order to produce the high n@xmath6/co ratio observed .",
    "deriving absolute fractional abundances is more difficult , but from the n@xmath6/co ratio and our monte carlo radiative transfer calculations we estimate a fractional abundance for n@xmath6 of @xmath4 2 @xmath12 10@xmath69 .",
    "n@xmath6 would therefore represent a substantial fraction of the cosmically available nitrogen , this plus the gas phase n@xmath6/co ratio inferred for lkca 15 provides a direct observational connection to comets .",
    "the abundance of n@xmath6 in comets is an important guide to their volatile content because it is trapped and released by amorphous ice in a manner similar to that of ar ( @xcite ) .",
    "this process has implications for understanding the role of comets for delivery of volatiles and noble gases to the terrestrial planets . @xcite",
    "have reviewed the total nitrogen abundance in comet halley and argued that it is depleted by 2 - 6 fold relative to that of the sun .",
    "the laboratory experiments performed by @xcite showed that co is trapped 20 times more efficiently than n@xmath6 in amorphous ice formed at 50 k and @xcite predicted that in icy planetesimals forming in the solar nebula at about 50 k , n@xmath6/co @xmath73 0.06 in the gases trapped in the ice provided n@xmath6/co @xmath73 1 in the nebula itself , a value quite consistent with our data .",
    "@xcite reported n@xmath6/co @xmath4 @xmath118 in halley s comet , whereas @xcite found n@xmath6/co @xmath4 @xmath119 in comet bradfield , and n@xmath6/co @xmath4 @xmath120 in comet kohoutek .",
    "the observations are actually of the two molecular ions ( co@xmath3 and n@xmath121 ) and the conversion from the ion abundances to those of the neutrals is dependent on poorly constrained photodestruction branching ratios .",
    "@xcite argued that the ion ratio must be multiplied by a factor of 2 , while @xcite find no factor necessary .",
    "large amounts of gaseous n@xmath6 may thus be required in the outer solar nebula , as we find in the disk of lkca  15 , in order to explain the n@xmath6/co ratios found in comets .",
    "this can be confirmed by measurements of the n@xmath6/co ratio in dynamically new comets , which should have higher values than those in short - period comets ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have detected molecular gas and continuum emission from the disk encircling the t tauri star lkca  15 at frequencies between 85 and 260 ghz .",
    "the 1.2 mm dust continuum emission is resolved in our @xmath122 beam with a minimum diameter of 190 au and an inclination angle of @xmath457@xmath123 .",
    "a noticeable decrease in the continuum spectral slope with frequency may result from the combination of grain growth and dust settling .",
    "sensitive observations at longer wavelengths and submillimeter continuum images are needed to confirm the trend .",
    "based on keplerian rotation model fits to the co velocity field , the gas emission extends to @xmath4750 au while the characteristic radius of the disk is determined to be closer to 425 au from gaussian fits to the co 2@xmath71 spectral data cube .",
    "we have also presented molecular images of various isotopologues of co and the hco@xmath3 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 ions in the disk .",
    "our observations show that most of the molecular emission from the dominant species of common molecules is optically thick .",
    "different molecules and even different transitions of one molecule will therefore probe different layers of the disk ; most of the emitting region detected is near the disk surface .",
    "detailed radiative transfer modelling indicates that lte is not appropriate in these regions . with this 2d model and the column densities from the detection of the hco@xmath3 and n@xmath6h@xmath3 ions ,",
    "we derive a lower limit to the fractional ionization of 10@xmath8 and an n@xmath6/co ratio of 2 , which reveals a region where co is heavily depleted but n@xmath6 is not .",
    "this zone must be well protected by the efficient shielding of ultraviolet radiation by an overlying disk layer .",
