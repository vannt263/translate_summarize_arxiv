    "during the past years , several methods have been developed to solve the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation accurately for few - nucleon bound states , by using realistic nuclear potentials .",
    "these methods are the crcgv @xcite , the sv @xcite , the hh @xcite , the gfmc @xcite , the ncsm @xcite , the eihh @xcite and the faddeev .",
    "these calculational approaches are mostly based on a partial wave ( pw ) decomposition .",
    "stochastic and monte carlo methods , however , are performed directly using the position vectors in the configuration space .",
    "one of the most viable approaches appears to be the faddeev method .",
    "the calculations based on the faddeev approach are performed after a pw expansion with phenomenological potentials either in the momentum space @xcite-@xcite or in the configuration space @xcite- @xcite .",
    "recent bound state calculations with the faddeev approach have been done with the chiral potentials in the momentum space @xcite-@xcite .",
    "experience in three - nucleon calculations shows that the standard treatment based on a pw decomposition is quite successful but also rather complex , since each building block related to involved operators requires extended algebra .",
    "the faddeev calculations based on a pw decomposition , which includes the spin - isospin degrees of freedom , after truncation leads to a set of a finite number of coupled equations in two variables for the amplitudes and one needs a large number of partial waves to get converged results . in view of this large number of interfering terms it appears natural to give up such an expansion and work directly with the vector variables . on this basis three- and four - body bound states",
    "have recently been studied in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) approach where the spin - isospin degrees of freedom have been neglected in the first attempt @xcite-@xcite . in the case of three - body",
    "bound state the faddeev equations have been formulated for three identical bosons as a function of vector jacobi momenta , with the specific stress upon the magnitudes of the momenta and the angle between them . adding the spin - isospin to the 3d formalism is a major additional task , which will increase more degrees of freedom into the states and therefore will lead to a strictly finite number of coupled equations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have attempted to implement this task by including the spin - isospin degrees of freedom in the 3n bound state formalism . to this end",
    "we have formulated the faddeev equations for the 3n bound state with the advantage of using the realistic nn forces .",
    "the presented 3d formalism in this paper in comparison with the traditional pw formalism avoids the highly involved angular momentum algebra occurring for the permutation operators .",
    "according to the spin - isospin states that have been taken into account , we have obtained the eight , twelve , sixteen and twenty four coupled equations for a description of the 3n bound state , i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in this way",
    ", we solve the faddeev integral equations for calculation of the triton binding energy with bonn - b potential .",
    "the input to our calculations is the two - body @xmath3-matrix which has been calculated in an approach based on a helicity representation and depends on the magnitudes of the initial and final momenta and the angle between them @xcite .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] we present the formalism . meaning that we have derived the faddeev equations and the 3n wave function in a realistic 3d scheme both as a function of jacobi momenta vectors and the spin - isospin quantum numbers .",
    "also the novel 3d representation of the faddeev equations is contrasted with the corresponding traditional pw representation . in section [ sec : numerical results ] we present our results for the triton binding energy and compare them with the results obtained from the pw calculations . in order to test our calculations the calculated expectation values of the hamiltonian operator are compared to the obtained eigenvalue energies . finally in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] a summary and an outlook will be presented .",
