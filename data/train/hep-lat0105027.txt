    "lattice qcd has had considerable success in the understanding of the energies of few - quark systems .",
    "however , the spatial distributions of the quarks in these systems have received much less attention .",
    "the reasons for this are two - fold .",
    "firstly , unlike energies , these distributions are not directly observable , but only arise in integrated forms such as sum - rules , form - factors , transition rates etc . secondly ,",
    "as will be seen later , their measurement on a lattice is more difficult and less accurate than the corresponding energies . in spite of this",
    ", it is of interest to extract lattice estimates of various spatial distributions and this is the aim of the present study .",
    "there have been earlier lattice measurements of radial distributions . however , they differ from the present work in several ways . for example , in ref .  @xcite the authors are interested in the coupling between @xmath7-mesons and the @xmath8 , which involves a pseudo - vector coupling of the @xmath8 to a single quark . in contrast , here it is the charge and matter distributions that are studied and these involve vector and scalar couplings .",
    "scalar coupling to single quarks was also studied in refs .",
    "however , there only the scalar sum - rule was evaluated , since that was primary a study of the dependence of the meson mass on the quark masses .",
    "a knowledge of spatial distributions can be utilized in a variety of ways .",
    "for example , the charge distribution of the light quark @xmath9 in a heavy - light meson @xmath10 can be used to check possible potential models , where the distributions are calculated from wavefunctions generated by some differential equation containing an interquark potential @xmath11 . in such models @xcite",
    "there are several uncertainties  the form of @xmath11 , the form of the differential equation , how to include relativistic effects  some of which are tuned to ensure the model reproduces the correct @xmath10-energies .",
    "the latter can be in several partial waves @xmath12 and can be either the observed energies of , for example , the @xmath7-meson or the results of a lattice calculation .",
    "however , if also spatial distributions are known a priori from , say , a lattice calculation , then the uncertainties in such potential models will be reduced .",
    "another way that the @xmath10 charge distribution could be of use is in the understanding of multi - quark systems . in few - nucleon systems",
    "( e.g. @xmath13 ) it is found that the nucleon - nucleon correlations are , at short distances , very similar to that in the _ two_-nucleon system  with differences arising at large distances due to the different binding energies @xcite .",
    "this important observation can then be exploited in models of multi - nucleon systems , by assuming that the internucleon correlations are dominated by their two - nucleon counterparts . in the corresponding multi - quark case",
    "it would be of interest if a similar simplification were to arise .",
    "therefore , as a first step in that direction , a knowledge of the two - quark radial correlation in the basic @xmath10 case is needed  later to be compared with those in ,",
    "say , the @xmath14 or @xmath15 systems .",
    "this probing of the @xmath10 or @xmath15 structures could be carried to a more fundamental level by measuring the form of the underlying color fields that lead to the interquark potential @xmath11 and the radial correlations .",
    "such an extension would be analogous to the study of these fields in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 systems  see refs .  @xcite .",
    "it should be added that the heavy - light system @xmath10 is the quark model equivalent to the hydrogen atom @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , from a general point of view , it is of interest in any discussions comparing the properties of two - body sytems constructed from two particles one of which is very much heavier than the other .",
    "also the interactions in the two cases have common features  the coulomb potential @xmath19 of the hydrogen atom versus the one - gluon exchange @xmath20 in the heavy - light meson .    in section  [ mvr ] the maximal variance reduction method , crucial for extracting reliable results ,",
    "is briefly discussed . in section  [ formalism ]",
    "the formalism is introduced for evaluating the two- and three - point correlation functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in section  [ ana ] variational methods for analysing the lattice data are explained . in section",
    "[ results ] the results are given and in section  [ con ] some conclusions are made .",
    "it has been demonstrated that light - quark propagators can be constructed in an efficient way using the so - called maximum variance reduction(mvr ) method . since",
    "this has been explained in detail elsewhere , for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , the emphasis here will be mainly on the differences that arise when estimating on a lattice the correlation functions @xmath23 needed for measuring spatial charge and matter densities . in the mvr method",
    "the inverse of a positive definite matrix @xmath24 is expressed in the form of a monte carlo integration @xmath25 where the scalar fields @xmath26 are pseudo - fermions located on lattice sites @xmath27 . for a given gauge configuration on this lattice , @xmath28 independent samples of the @xmath26 fields can be constructed by monte carlo techniques resulting in a stochastic estimate of @xmath29 as an average of these @xmath28 samples i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath28 samples of the @xmath26 fields can be calculated separately and stored for use in any problem involving light quarks with the same gauge configurations .    in qcd",
    "the matrix of interest is the wilson - dirac matrix @xmath31 , which is not positive definite for those values of the hopping parameter @xmath32 that are of interest .",
    "therefore , we must deal with @xmath33 , which is positive definite . since @xmath34 contains only nearest neighbour interactions , @xmath24  with at most next - to - nearest neighbour interactions ",
    "is still sufficiently local for effective updating schemes to be implemented . in this case",
    "the light - quark propagator from site @xmath35 to site @xmath36 is expressed as @xmath37 this is the key element in the following formalism .",
    "the wilson - dirac matrix also leads to an alternative form for the above light - quark propagator from site @xmath35 to near site @xmath36 @xmath38 later , it will be essential to use at some lattice sites operators that are _ purely local_. this then restricts us to using at such sites only the @xmath26 fields that are located on single lattice sites .",
    "in contrast the @xmath39 fields  defined as @xmath40  are not purely local , since they contain @xmath26 fields on next - to - nearest neighbour sites .    in the above ,",
    "the term `` maximal variance reduction '' comes from the technique applied to reduce the statistical noise in eq .",
    "[ gauss2 ] .",
    "the lattice is divided into two boxes ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) whose boundary is kept fixed .",
    "variance of the pseudofermionic fields is then reduced by numerically solving the equation of motion inside each box .",
    "this allows the variance of propagators from one box to the other to be greatly reduced .",
    "however , in the case of a three - point correlation two propagators are needed and this is best treated by choosing one of the points to be on the boundary of the boxes while the other two are inside their own boxes .",
    "furthermore , the field at the boundary must be local to avoid the two propagators interfering with each other .",
    "this means that only the @xmath26 fields can be used on the boundary and there they couple to the charge or matter operator . for the points in the boxes ,",
    "the temporal distance from the boundary should be approximately equal to give the propagators a similar degree of statistical variance .",
    "in this section an expression is given for evaluating the two - point correlation @xmath21  needed for extracting the basic @xmath44 energies ( @xmath45 ) and eigenfunctions(@xmath46 ) .",
    "this is then extended to the three - point correlation @xmath22 in order to measure the radial correlations .",
    "details are given in the appendix .",
    "given the above light - quark propagators , then the two - point correlation functions @xmath21 needed for extracting the energies of a heavy - light meson can be expressed in the four ways shown in fig .",

    "the construction of the three - point correlation functions @xmath22 follows that of @xmath21 and are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2r ] . since a probe",
    "is now inserted at a distance @xmath54 from the heavy - quark ( @xmath55 ) , two light - quark propagators enter ",
    "one from @xmath55 to the probe and a second from the probe back to the @xmath55 .",
    "the purpose of the probe is to measure the charge or matter distribution at a definite point @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , only those light - quark propagators that involve the local basic field @xmath26 at @xmath56 can be used , since the @xmath57 field contains contributions from @xmath26 fields at next - to - nearest neighbour sites and so is _ non - local_. later , when fuzzing is introduced similar restrictions will enter . in this work",
    "two probes are studied : i ) @xmath58 that measures the charge distribution ( actually the light quark charge normalised to 1 ) and ii ) @xmath59 that measures the matter distribution of the light quark .    as shown in the appendix ,",
