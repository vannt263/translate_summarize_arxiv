    "the specific setting from which this paper draws inspiration is that of a toy model of nanowire ( a string of molecules much longer than tall ) resting upon a superconducting plate .",
    "as one investigates the behavior of an electron ( modeled as a pointmass ) in a field of electrons , he or she assumes an electron obeys the law of reflection at the top of the ` wire ' and then collides in the bottom of the ` wire , ' and subsequently disappears .",
    "the electron does not truly disappear ( nor does it truly strictly obey the law of reflection ) , but is pulled from the nanowire and forced to pair with another electron , this newly formed pair of electrons being called a _",
    "cooper pair _ ; see figure [ fig : electronpairing ] for an illustration of an idealization of this phenomenon .",
    "it is worth noting that this toy model is valid when the energy in the system is the fermi energy , this being an important requirement in the study of the solid state physics of metallic substances and superconductors .",
    "specifically , retro - reflection will not occur when the energy of the system is not the fermi energy .    in the absence of the electron ,",
    "the ` stationary ' electrons react to the departure of the electron by exhibiting a wave ( visually speaking ) around the hole that gives the illusion that the hole is moving back along the trajectory of the electron .",
    "the hole then eventually collides into the bottom of the wire , whereupon an electron is pulled back into the nanowire ; see figure [ fig : electronfillshole ]",
    ".            seeking to reigorously define ( mathematical ) andreev reflection , in our idealized setting , we will assign a parity to a pointmass .",
    "the pointmass begins with positive parity . upon intersecting with the andreev subset of an andreev billiard ( both of which to be formally defined in  [ sec : physicallyinspiredbilliard ] ) , the parity reverses and becomes negative , much like how the departure of an electron from a nanowire results in a hole .",
    "subsequent collisions in the andreev subset cause the parity to change from negative to positive and from positive to negative .    the second goal is twofold : 1 ) to rigorously define an andreev billiard and 2 ) rigorously define the continuous and discrete flows on an andreev billiard .",
    "once we have rigorously defined an andreev billiard , we will show that the continuous and discrete flows ( as defined ) will preserve the essence of an andreev billiard , namely , the continuous flow will negate the volume form @xmath6 when intersecting with the andreev subset and the discrete flow will preserve the measure @xmath31",
    ".    the third goal will be to examine the properties of the continuous / discrete flow .",
    "that is , we will show that under certain conditions , for almost every initial direction , the flow on almost any polygonal andreev billiard will be closed .",
    "finally , taking motivation from experimental investigations of physical andreev billiards , we will investigate the effect of a fractal perturbation a toy model of a rectangular andreev billiard .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : physicallyinspiredbilliard ] , the physics of an andreev billiard is described and rigorous definitions of mathematical andreev reflection and polygonal andreev billiard are given .",
    "the continuous flow @xmath2 on a polygonal andreev billiard is described in  [ sec : ctsflow ] and it is there that one sees that the absolute value of the volume element on the phase space of the billiard is preserved .",
    "in fact , the parity of the billiard ball of physical andreev billiard is reflected in the fact that the volume element changes sign under the flow @xmath2 . in  [ sec : discreteflow ] , the discrete flow is described and is shown to preserve the measure @xmath32 on a section of the phase space . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : perturbationsintheandreevsideofomegaa ] , an investigation of the effects of a fractal perturbation of the toy model of a physical andreev billiard is made .",
    "the reason for this investigation is to present theoretic evidence in support of the argument that certain rough boundaries of physical andreev billiards can be first studied as fractally perturbed boundaries .",
    "a discussion of the results is then given and directions for future research are discussed .",
    "we begin with a definition , with the end goal being a rigorous definition for andreev reflection ( given in the form of an equivalence relation @xmath1 ) and an andreev billiard .",

    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : physicalandreevreflection ] , in a ( mathematical ) andreev billiard , when the pointmass retro - reflects in a side of @xmath8 , the parity of the pointmass changes .",
