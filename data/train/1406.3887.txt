    "squeezed spin states @xcite are entangled quantum states of an ensemble of two - level ( or spin - half ) systems , and they play significant roles in quantum information science @xcite and quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "people have made much progress in both theory and experiment over the past decades @xcite .",
    "specifically , the recent experimental success of achieving the one - axis twisting ( oat ) scheme in spinor bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) using two chosen hyperfine states provides an ideal platform to implement such novel states in a highly controllable manner @xcite .",
    "as is well known , two - axis twisting ( tat ) is capable of causing heisenberg limited noise reduction to scale as @xmath2 , better than the oat , whose noise reduction limit scales as @xmath3 @xcite . to realize better spin squeezing ,",
    "several theoretical proposals have been presented to enhance the oat spin squeezed states @xcite . in one scheme @xcite",
    ", one applies a series of subtle rabi pulses to the system with the purpose of transforming oat into tat . due to a large number of pulses acting on the atoms , it s unavoidable to bring in accumulated noise and imperfection in control pulses . in another approach @xcite ,",
    "only several pulses are needed to obtain much better squeezed spin states .",
    "however , to achieve the optimal squeezing it takes a long evolution time , which would be an obstacle in systems with short coherence time . additionally , this scheme is also spin number dependent , so it naturally brings in certain difficulties when applied to some systems , such as ultracold atomic gases , in which we do not know the spin number @xmath4 exactly .    here",
    "we propose a scheme following the idea of transforming oat into tat to enhance the performance of oat .",
    "compared with the method discussed in the paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , pulse sequences based on trotter - suzuki ( ts ) expansion @xcite are proposed . to achieve this",
    ", we also introduce another kind of radio frequency ( rf ) pulses to realize the rotation around the @xmath5 axis apart from that around the @xmath6 axis @xcite .",
    "we note that the scheme can be generalized to implement pulse sequences based on any high order ts expansion within these experimentally available conditions .",
    "a numerical investigation of the scheme based on the @xmath7nd - order expansion indicates that only @xmath1 cycles are enough to obtain the ideal spin squeezed states , while more than @xmath0 cycles are needed in @xcite to get the same results .",
    "so compared with the previous proposals @xcite , our idea can overcome their disadvantage to some extent .",
    "moreover , we also provide the corresponding error analysis for a scheme using higher- order ts expansions .",
    "to clarify our key point in this paper , we first briefly review the ts expansion theory @xcite . the standard @xmath8st- and @xmath7nd - order ts real decomposition of @xmath9 ( with the commutation relation @xmath10\\neq 0 $ ] in terms of operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) for small @xmath13 are @xmath14 for the @xmath15rd - order expansion , we begin with @xmath16 the @xmath15rd - order symmetric approximation @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 with the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20-th order expansion is the same as the @xmath15rd - order one , @xmath21 @xcite . in general , the @xmath22th and @xmath23th approximants , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are determined recursively as @xmath26 with the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "according to refs @xcite , the oat hamiltonian existing in two - component bec controlled by coupling pulses can be written as @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the collective angular momentum operator for the system with @xmath4 spins , @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 indicates the nonlinear interaction strength between the atoms . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as the coupling pulse amplitudes .",
    "the model hamiltonian in eq.(5 ) is the so - called lipkin - meshkov - glick model @xcite",
    ". some aspects of this model have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here and in the following , we assume @xmath34 and @xmath35 when the coupling pulses are switched on and @xmath36 when they are turned off .",
    "note that we will ignore the nonlinear interaction @xmath37 during the time applying the coupling pulses , because the conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are satisfied when the strong coupling rabi pulses are switched on .",
    "the terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 can realize the rotation of @xmath42 around the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axis by angle @xmath43 with @xmath44 . the rotation operator @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 and it rotates @xmath42 as follows @xmath47 using this definition , the combination of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is able to accomplish the following operations @xmath50 from eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.rotation_x&y ) ] ) we find out that the terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 can - not be realized directly with the hamiltonian shown by eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.hamiltonian ) ] ) .    to generate the tat evolution",
    "@xmath53 , we notice that @xmath54 is conserved during the dynamics .",
    "so up to a constant phase factor , we can write @xmath55 as @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a small time interval . therefore the @xmath8st- and @xmath7nd - order expansion can be obtained as @xmath59 equation ( [ ( eq.tro1&2_expansion ) ] ) tells us the rotation @xmath60 is required to realize the evolution @xmath61 , namely , after introducing the @xmath41 pulse we can simulate the tat based on eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.hamiltonian ) ] ) .",
    "the work based on ts @xmath8st - order expansion has been finished by liu _",
    "et al_. @xcite , and the pulse sequence is shown in fig . [",
    "fig.tro1&2.pulse](b ) .",
    "next we will provide the expansion scheme according to the ts @xmath7nd - order expansion theory shown in eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.tro1&2_expansion ) ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig.tro1&2.pulse](a ) shows the pulse sequences of our scheme a. within each period , two strong pulses @xmath62 and @xmath63 are employed at time @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively to realize the rotation shown in eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.pi/2rotation ) ] ) .",
    "here @xmath66 is the time interval of a single period and @xmath67 with @xmath68 the number of total period . in this case",
    "we have @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is defined as the pulse number added in each period .    without the controlling pulses , the dynamics of the system",
    "is determined by the hamiltonian @xmath71 , so the evolution operator for one single period @xmath72 is @xmath73    if we bring in @xmath68 periods the same as the one described above during a fixed interested time , the complete time evolution operator at time instant @xmath74 is written as @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.u1n.eff ) ] ) we find that the effective hamiltonian of the system is @xmath76 .",
    "hence to realize the tat evolution @xmath77 , with @xmath78 the time when the optimal squeezing state is achieved , our scheme a takes the total time @xmath79 .    to proceed with our scheme b ,",
    "let us refer to the ts @xmath15rd - order expansion formula eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.tro3.2 ) ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there exists a term @xmath80 on its right side , which can not be realized directly since @xmath81 . to solve this , we go back to eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.tro3.1 ) ] ) and transform @xmath82 to @xmath83 . taking into account the property of @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath84 therefore , following the same routine , we have the final result as @xmath85    from eq .",
    "( [ ( eq.tro3_expansion ) ] ) , we find that both the coupling pulses @xmath40 and @xmath41 are needed to implement the evolution @xmath86 and @xmath87 . figure [ fig.tro3.pulse](a ) shows the corresponding pulse sequences within one single period : two pulses @xmath88 and @xmath89 are employed at time @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , to implement a rotation around the @xmath6 axis ; then another two pulses @xmath92 and @xmath93 are added at time @xmath94 and @xmath95 ; and finally , a @xmath6 rotation is applied again with the pulses added at time @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "here @xmath98 , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "we note that the duration time of one single period is @xmath104 . in scheme b ,",
    "the pulse number needed in one single period is @xmath105 .",
    "following the similar way of getting the result of our scheme a , we conclude that the effective evolution of our scheme b is @xmath106 with an effective hamiltonian @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , in this case the evolution time arriving at the optimal squeezing is @xmath108 .",
    "we note that the above method can be generalized to implement the tat hamiltonian based on any higher - order ts expansion .     vs time @xmath109 in arbitrary unit .",
    "( a ) the whole pulse sequence of scheme a. one period from 0 to @xmath110 ( shaded ) consists of rotations @xmath88 ( red pulse ) and @xmath89 ( pink pulse ) .",
    "( b ) the proposal in paper @xcite .",
    "apart from the time at which applying the laser pulses , others are all the same with ( a ) . ]",
    "to get the numerical result , we follow kitagawa and ueda s criteria that choose the squeezing parameter @xmath111 as the measurement of the squeezing , where @xmath112 is the smallest variance normal to the mean spin vector and @xmath113 is the total spin of the system .",
    "the initial state we choose is @xmath114 , where all the spins are polarized along the @xmath115 axis .",
    "this state is favorable when the twisting hamiltonian @xmath116 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that for the scheme based on the @xmath8st - order expansion , @xmath0 pulse pairs are enough to get the optimal spin squeezing with required precision .",
    "this result is obtained by taking into account every time instant in the time period from @xmath117 to @xmath118 @xmath119 .",
    "that is , at every time instant @xmath109 satisfying @xmath120 , the approximated time evolution almost overlaps with the dynamics driven by the ideal tat hamiltonian .",
    "however , according to the theoretical analysis presented in eqs .",
    "( [ ( eq.u1.eff ) ] ) and ( [ ( eq.u1n.eff ) ] ) , we notice that only the result at time instant @xmath117 is necessary to be calculated .",
    "this reminds us of searching for a more efficient way to obtain the optimal spin squeezing states based on these dynamics controlling procedures .",
    "this is also the way discussed in paper @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig.tro1.ntc&non_ntc ] and [ fig.tro2.ntc&non_ntc ] show the numerical time evolution of the corresponding two schemes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.tro1&2.pulse](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.tro1&2.pulse](b ) .",
    "one can see that in both cases , the numerical results exhibit oscillation behaviors away from the ideal dynamics when @xmath121 is large . for the scheme based on the @xmath8st - order ts expansion , the spin squeezing parameter @xmath122 at time instant @xmath123 is always on the top of the evolution curve , even for large @xmath68 . therefore , to achieve the ideal spin squeezing at time @xmath78 ,",
    "@xmath58 should be sufficiently small , which indicates a relatively large @xmath68 .",
    "however , for scheme a based on the @xmath7nd - order ts expansion , the corresponding values @xmath122 at time instant @xmath123 moves to the bottom of the evolution curve as @xmath68 increases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.tro2.ntc&non_ntc ] .",
    "so with much smaller @xmath68 , we can obtain a good approximation of the optimal spin squeezing @xmath122 by controlling the total evolution time .",
    "figure 5 shows the tracks of @xmath122 at time instant @xmath124 for different schemes . as a result",
    ", we conclude while it requires as many as @xmath125 periods to get a good result using the proposal in @xcite , a much smaller @xmath68 @xmath126 is sufficient when scheme a is employed without introducing new controlling pulses .    to investigate the efficiency of the scheme based on higher - order ts expansions , in fig .",
    "[ fig.tro3.ntc ] we plot the squeezing parameter following scheme b for @xmath127 with pulse number @xmath128 .",
    "one can see that a large deviation from the ideal evolution derived by @xmath129 appears as the duration time grows . in principle , when the duration time of the single period of ts expansion is fixed , for the same evolution time , the higher - order ts expansion will lead to the higher precision compared with the lower - order one .",
    "however , in this problem our scheme b takes a longer evolution time to achieve the optimal squeezing compared with scheme a. with the effective hamiltonian @xmath130 , scheme b needs an evolution time @xmath108 to realize the tat optimal squeezing , while scheme a only takes time @xmath79 .",
    "so for the fixed pulse number @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ fig.tro1&2.ntc ] and [ fig.tro3.ntc ] , the duration times of one single period for the two schemes satisfy @xmath131 .",
    "this is the reason scheme a has a better result . with the increase of the pulse number @xmath132",
    ", we can make the duration times @xmath133 and @xmath134 smaller and smaller , and finally scheme b will have a better result than scheme a because the error in the @xmath15-rd order expansion decreases faster than that of the @xmath7nd - order expansion .",
    "figure [ fig.tro1&2.error ] shows the error analysis for both schemes with a different total number of pulses @xmath132 .",
    "one can see that scheme a always has a relatively lower error rate and shorter evolution time until @xmath132 reaches @xmath135 .",
    "such a large @xmath132 requires too many resources .",
    "we conclude that scheme b may have higher precision when @xmath132 is large enough , but it requires too many controlling pulses and is experimentally impractical .",
    "a simplified scheme a based on @xmath7nd - order ts expansion is enough for our purposes .    after the paper of ref.@xcite , shen _",
    "et al_. also presented an idea @xcite to enhance the performance of oat to get spin squeezed states close to the heisenberg limit . compared with their proposal ,",
    "our result takes a shorter evolution time . taking @xmath136 as an example ,",
    "the time cost of our scheme a(b ) is around @xmath137 , shorter than their @xmath138 . besides , our scheme is also spin number independent .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a scheme using a series of rf pulses to transform an oat to a tat hamiltonian .",
    "in contrast to the proposal in ref.@xcite , our scheme a reduces the pulse number from @xmath125 to 50 for @xmath127 atoms , which is very experimentally friendly . with the help of the terms @xmath41 and @xmath40 , pulse sequences designed according to higher order trotter - suzuki expansion can be realized .",
    "we find that while scheme b can reach optimal spin squeezing with high precision during the whole evolution , it needs too many controlling pulses and is experimentally impractical .",
    "we note that our scheme is spin - number independent , and it can be generalized in other systems where only an oat hamiltonian @xcite is realized .",
    "moreover , compared to the known work @xcite , our schemes also have a relatively shorter evolution time .",
    "therefore they should be realizable with current techniques , such as those reported in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
