    "figure 1 ( taken from the cover of ref .",
    "@xcite ) summarizes the different types of clustering discussed during the last two or three decades  @xcite .",
    "most of these structures were investigated in an experimental context by using either some new approaches or developments of older methods  @xcite .",
    "starting in the 1960s the search for resonant structures in the excitation functions for various combinations of light @xmath3-cluster ( @xmath1=@xmath2 ) nuclei in the energy regime from the coulomb barrier up to regions with excitation energies of @xmath4=20@xmath550  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate  @xcite .",
    "these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "the question of how quasimolecular resonances may reflect continuous transitions from scattering states in the ion - ion potential to true cluster states in the compound systems was still unresolved in the 1990s @xcite .",
    "in many cases , these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with @xmath3-clustering phenomena @xcite , predicted from the nilsson - strutinsky approach , the cranked @xmath3-cluster model  @xcite , or other mean - field calculations  @xcite . in light",
    "@xmath3-like nuclei clustering is observed as a general phenomenon at high excitation energy close to the @xmath3-decay thresholds @xcite .",
    "this exotic behavior has been perfectly illustrated by the famous ",

    "some of the predicted but elusive phenomena , such as molecular orbitals or linear chain structures , are now gradually coming to light .",

    "the topic of clustering in nuclei benefits of intense theoretical activity where new experimental information has come to light very recently .",

    "calculations @xcite .",
    "the picture of the @xmath11be nucleus prediced by the no core shell model @xcite as being a dumbbell - shaped configuration of two alpha particles closely resembles the superdeformed ( sd ) shapes known to arise in heavier nuclei in the actinide mass region .",
    "this dumbbell - like structure gives rise to a rotational band , from which the moment of inertia is found to be commensurate with an axial deformation of 2:1 .",
    "the possible of large deformation of light @xmath3-conjugate nuclei with sd , hyperdeformed ( hd ) and linear - chain configurations will be discussed in following sections .",
    "the renewed interest in @xmath0c was mainly focused to a better understanding of the nature of the so called `` hoyle '' state @xcite , the excited 0@xmath12 state at 7.654 mev that can be described in terms of a bosonic condensate , a cluster state and/or a @xmath3-particle gas @xcite .",
    "the resonant `` hoyle '' state @xcite ( without it carbon would not exist as proved in 1957 by an experimental group at caltech @xcite ) is regarded as the prototypical alpha - cluster state whose existence is of great importance for the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0c within stars .",

    "the most convincing experimental result comes from measurements of the @xmath0c(@xmath14,@xmath3)@xmath11be reaction performed at the higs facility @xcite .",
    "the measured angular distributions of the alpha particles are consistent with an @xmath15=2 pattern including a dominant 2@xmath12 component .",
    "this 2@xmath13 state that appears at around 10 mev is considered to be the 2@xmath12 excitation of the `` hoyle '' state ( in agreement with the previous experimental investigation of itoh et al .",

    "still , the structure of the `` hoyle '' state remains controversial as experimental results of its direct decay into three @xmath3 particles are found to be in disagreement  @xcite .      in the study of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , that will be presented in more detail in section 5 , the @xmath3-particle states in light @xmath1=@xmath2",
    "nuclei @xcite , are of great importance . at present , the search for an experimental signature of bec in @xmath8o is of highest priority .",

    "a state with the structure of the  hoyle `` state @xcite in @xmath0c coupled to an @xmath3 particle is predicted in @xmath8o at about 15.1 mev ( the 0@xmath17 state ) , the energy of which is @xmath18 700 kev above the 4@xmath3-particle breakup threshold @xcite .",
    "however , any state in @xmath8o equivalent to the ",
    "hoyle '' state @xcite in @xmath0c is most certainly going to decay exclusively by particle emission with very small @xmath14-decay branches , thus , very efficient particle-@xmath14 coincidence techniques will have to be used in the near future to search for them .",
    "bec states are expected to decay by alpha emission to the  hoyle \" state and could be found among the resonances in @xmath3-particle inelastic scattering on @xmath0c decaying to that state . in 1967",
    "chevallier et al .",
    "@xcite could excite these states in the @xmath3-particle transfer channel leading to the @xmath19be@xmath19be final state and proposed that a structure corresponding to a rigidly rotating linear arrangement of four alpha particles may exist in @xmath8o . at this time",
    "this experimental observation was considered as the equivalent of the three alpha chain states postulated by morinaga for the @xmath0c nucleus @xcite . however , very recently , a more sophisticated experimental setup was used at notre dame @xcite : although the excitation function is generally in good agreement with the previous results @xcite a phase shift analysis of the angular distributions does not provide evidence to support the reported hypothesis of a 4@xmath3-chain state configuration .",
    "experimental investigations are still underway to understand the nuclear structure of high spin states of both @xmath8o and @xmath9ne nuclei for instance at notre dame and/or ithemba labs @xcite facilities .",
    "another possibility might be to perform coulomb excitation measurements with intense @xmath8o and @xmath9ne beams at intermediate energies .",
    "the nucleus viewed as a collection of @xmath3-particles has been discussed all over the mass table since a long time and it was only recently shown that clear deviations from statistical models in the decay of excited @xmath10 mg exist @xcite . as far as the theory is concerned , a diversity of cluster / symmetry models ( cluster models , _ ab initio _ calculations , bec etc ... ) which make concrete predictions in terms of alpha clustering in light nuclei is available on the market .",
    "what is presently missing is a clearly defined procedure for relating these abstract predictions to the observed level schemes and clear criteria for what constitutes discriminating evidence for a particuliar model .",
    "a more detailed discussion of bec will be proposed in one of the forthcoming section ( section 5 ) .",
    "the search for exotic chain - like structures in light @xmath3-conjugate nuclei remains an exciting prospect .",
    "experiments reporting tentative evidence of @xmath3-chains in @xmath0c @xcite .",
    "@xmath8o @xcite , @xmath9ne @xcite and @xmath10 mg @xcite have been largely unsubstantiated , and the view is that such structure have not yet been definitively observed experimentally .",
    "the real link between superdeformation / hyperdemormation ( sd / hd ) , nuclear molecules and alpha clustering @xcite is of particular interest , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 have the typical ellipsoidal elongation for light nuclei i.e. with quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath20 @xmath18 0.6 .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes - hyperdeformation with @xmath20 @xmath18 1.0 - has also been discussed for actinide nuclei @xcite in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "typical examples for possible relationship between quasimolecular bands and extremely deformed ( sd / hd ) shapes have been widely discussed in the literature for @xmath21 @xmath3-conjugate @xmath1=@xmath2 nuclei , such as @xmath22si @xcite , @xmath23s @xcite , @xmath24ar @xcite , @xmath25ca @xcite , @xmath26ti @xcite , @xmath27cr @xcite and @xmath28ni @xcite .",
    "excitation functions have been measured over a wide range energies for many reactions .",
    "norrby discussed a study of @xmath23s via the @xmath22si+@xmath3 reaction @xcite that revealed 30 new level assignements spanning 132 resonances in total .",
    "in fact , highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been discovered in several light @xmath3-conjugate nuclei , such as @xmath24ar and @xmath25ca by using @xmath14-ray spectroscopy techniques @xcite . in particular , the extremely deformed rotational bands in @xmath24ar ( shown as crosses in fig .",
    "3 ) might be comparable in shape to the quasimolecular bands observed in both @xmath0c+@xmath10 mg ( shown as open triangles ) and @xmath8o+@xmath9ne ( shown as full rectangles ) reactions .",
    "these resonances belong to a rotational band , with a moment of inertia close to that of a hd band provided by both the cranked @xmath3-cluster model @xcite and the nilsson - strutinsky calculations .",
    "the fact that similar quasi - molecular states observed in the two reactions fall on the same rotational band gives further support to our interpretation of the @xmath24ar composite system resonances .",
    "an identical conclusion was reached for the @xmath25ca composite system where sd bands have been discovered @xcite .",
    "therefore , similar investigations are underway for heavier @xmath3-like composite systems such as @xmath26ti @xcite , @xmath27cr @xcite and @xmath28ni @xcite .",
    "ternary clusterizations in light @xmath3-like composite systems are also predicted theoretically , but were not found experimentally in @xmath24ar so far @xcite . on the other hand , ternary fission of @xmath28ni  related to its hd shapes  was identified from out - of - plane angular correlations measured in the @xmath23s+@xmath10 mg reaction with the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) at the vivitron tandem facility of the iphc , strasbourg @xcite .",
    "this finding @xcite is not limited to light @xmath1=@xmath2 compound nuclei , true ternary fission @xcite can also occur for very heavy @xcite and superheavy @xcite nuclei .",
    "clustering in light nuclei is traditionally explored through reaction studies , but observation of electromagnetic transitions can be of high value in establishing , for example , that highly - excited states with candidate cluster structure do indeed form rotational sequences .",
    "there is a renewed interest in the spectroscopy of the @xmath8o nucleus at high excitation energy @xcite .",

    "@xcite indicated that this state does not @xmath3-decay because of its non - natural parity ( in contrast to the two neighbouring 4@xmath31 states at 10.36  mev and 11.10  mev ) , but it @xmath14 decays to the 2@xmath31 state at 6.92  mev ( 54.6 @xmath32 2 @xmath33 ) and to the 3@xmath34 state at 6.13  mev ( 45.4% ) . by considering all the four possible transition types of the decay of the 3@xmath31 state ( _ i.e. _ e@xmath35 and m@xmath36 for the 3@xmath31 @xmath37 3@xmath38 transition and , m@xmath35 and e@xmath36 for the 3@xmath31 @xmath37 2@xmath31 transition ) , our calculations yield the conclusion that @xmath39  ev , a value fifty times lower than known previously , which is an important result for the well studied @xmath8o nucleus @xcite .",
    "clustering effects in the light neutron - rich oxygen isotopes @xmath40o will also be discussed in section 5 .",

    "the case of the mid-@xmath42-shell nucleus @xmath22si is of particular interest as it shows the coexistence of deformed and cluster states at rather low energies @xcite .",
    "its ground state is oblate , with a partial @xmath3-@xmath10 mg structure , two prolate normal deformed bands are found , one built on the @xmath43 state at 4.98 mev and on the @xmath44 state at 6.69 mev .",
    "the sd band candidate with a pronounced @xmath3-@xmath10 mg structure is suggested @xcite . in this band , the 2@xmath12 ( 9.8 mev ) , 4@xmath12 and 6@xmath12 members are well identified as",

    "4 .    in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss a resonant cluster band which is predicted to start close to the coulomb barrier of the @xmath0c+@xmath8o collision , i.e. around 25 mev excitation energy in @xmath22si . we have studied the @xmath0c(@xmath8o,@xmath14)@xmath22si radiative capture reaction at five resonant energies around the coulomb barrier by using the zero degree dragon spectrometer installed at triumf , vancouver @xcite .",
    "details about the setup , that has been optimized for the @xmath0c(@xmath0c,@xmath14)@xmath10 mg radiative capture reaction in our of previous dragon experiments , can be found in ref .",
    "the @xmath0c(@xmath8o,@xmath14)@xmath22si data clearly show @xcite the direct feeding of the prolate 4@xmath45 state at 9.16 mev and the octupole deformed 3@xmath34 at 6.88 mev .",
    "this state is the band head of an octupole band which mainly decays to the @xmath22si oblate ground state with a strong e@xmath46 transition .",
    "our results are very similar to what has been measured for the @xmath0c+@xmath0c radiative capture reaction above the coulomb barrier in the first dragon experiment @xcite where the enhanced feeding of the @xmath10 mg prolate band has been measured for a 4@xmath12 - 2@xmath12 resonance at e@xmath47 = 8.0 mev near the coulomb barrier .    at the lowest energy of @xmath0c+@xmath8o radiative capture reaction , an enhanced feeding from the resonance j@xmath48 = 2@xmath12 and 1@xmath12 t=1 states around 11 mev",
    "is observed in @xmath22si .",
    "again this is consistent with @xmath0c+@xmath0o radiative capture reaction data where j@xmath48 = 2@xmath12 has been assigned to the entrance resonance and an enhanced decay has been measured via intermediate 1@xmath12 t=1 states around 11 mev in @xmath10 mg .",
    "a definitive scenario for the decay of the resonances at these low bombarding energies in both systems will come from the measurement of the @xmath14 decay spectra with a @xmath14-spectrometer with better resolution than bgo but still rather good efficiency such as labr@xmath46 ( lanthanum ) crystals ( see also the forthcoming subsection ) .",
    "a further area where electromagnetic transitions would be of great interest in support of cluster models is in the case of the quasi - molecular resonances observed in the @xmath0c+@xmath0c reaction @xcite .",
    "the width of these resonances were @xmath18 100 kev , indicating the formation of a @xmath10 mg intermediate system with a lifetime significantly longer than the nuclear crossing time .",
    "these resonances were subsequently interpreted as @xmath0c+@xmath0c cluster states .",
    "there has been only one valient attempt to directly observe transitions in this reaction by haas et al .",
    "@xcite focussing on transitions between 10@xmath31 and 8@xmath31 resonant states at a bombarding energy e(@xmath0c ) = 32 mev chosen to populate a known and isolated 10@xmath12 resonance .",
    "position sensitive detectors ( psd ) were mounted on either side of the beam axis at the center of the chateau de cristal array of 74 barium fluoride detectors .",
    "triple @xmath14-@xmath0c-@xmath0c coincidences were recorded and it was possible to observe a few events in the expected energy window corresponding to the 10@xmath12 @xmath37 8@xmath12 transitions as shown by fig .",
    "5 . however , the data were not sufficiently clean to rule out these events as due to the experimental background .",
    "the measurement reported only an upper limit ( for the radiative partial width of 1.2 @xmath32 10@xmath49 ) given the extreme challenges of eliminating all background displayed in fig .",
    "it will be very interesting to revisit this earlier experiment taking advantage of new experimental techniques and developments in detector technology for the detection of gamma rays and/or fragments .",
    "for example , novel scintillator materials like lanthanum bromide offer superior resolution for the gamma ray of interest while improved silicon detector performance and solid angle coverage could lead to significant improvements both in sensitivity and in statistics .",
    "in principle the nucleus is a quasi - homogeneus collection of protons and neutrons , which adopts a spherical configuration i.e. a spherical droplet of nuclear matter . for light nuclei the nucleons are capable to arrange themselves into clusters of a bosonic character .",
    "the very stable @xmath3-particle is the most favorable light nucleus for quarteting - @xmath3 clustering - to occur in dense nuclear matter .",
    "these cluster structures have indeed a crucial role in the synthesis of elements in stars .",
    "the so called  hoyle \" state  @xcite , the main portal through which @xmath0c is created in nucleosynthesis with a pronounced three-@xmath3-cluster structure , is the best exemple of @xmath3 clustering in light nuclei . in",
    "@xmath3 clustering a geometric picture can be proposed in the framework of point group symmetries @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xmath19be the two @xmath3 clusters are separated by as much as @xmath18 2fm , @xmath0c exhibits a triangle arrangement of the three @xmath3 particles @xmath18 3fm apart , @xmath8o forms a tetrahedron , etc .",
    "evidence for tetrahedral symmetries in @xmath50 was given by the algebraic cluster model @xcite .",

    "in the assignment of the bands both the dependence of excitation energies on j(j+1 ) and the dependence of measured cross sections on 2j+1 @xcite were considered .",
    "slope parameters obtained in a linear fit to the excitation energies @xcite indicate the moment of inertia of the rotational bands given in the respective figures",

    "the first doublet ( k=0@xmath57 ) has a slightly larger moment of inertia ( smaller slope parameter ) in @xmath9o , which is consistent with its interpretation as @xmath7c@xmath58he or @xmath8c@xmath59he molecular structures ( they start well below the thresholds of 16.8 mev and 12.32 mev , respectively ) . the second band , for which the negative parity partner is yet to be determined , has a slope parameter slightly smaller than in @xmath54o",
    "this is consistent with the study of the bands in @xmath9o by furutachi et al .",
    "@xcite , which clearly establishes parity inversion doublets predicted by amd calculations for the @xmath7c@xmath60he cluster and @xmath7c-2n-@xmath3 molecular structures .",
    "the corresponding moments of inertia given in fig .",
    "5 are strongly suggesting large deformations for the cluster structures .",

    "therefore , the ikeda - diagram @xcite and the `` extended ikeda - diagram '' consisting of @xmath8o cluster cores with covalently bound neutrons @xcite must be further extended to include also the @xmath7c cluster cores as illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "the link of alpha clustering , quasimolecular resonances , orbiting phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) has been discussed in this review article .",
    "several examples emphasize the general connexion between molecular structure and deformation effects within the shell model , or rather the nilsson model .",
    "however , we have also presented the bec picture of light ( and medium - light ) @xmath3-like nuclei that appears to be an alternate way of understanding most of properties of nuclear clusters .",
    "new results regarding cluster and molecular states in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes in agreement with amd predictions are finally summarized .",
    "consequently , the  extended ikeda - diagram `` has been further modified for light neutron - rich nuclei by inclusion of the @xmath7c cluster , similarly to the @xmath8o one . of particular interest is the quest for the 4@xmath3 states of @xmath8o near the @xmath19be+@xmath19be and @xmath0c+@xmath3 decay thresholds , which correspond to the so - called  hoyle '' state . the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued by @xmath14-ray spectroscopy measurements , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged - particle techniques in the near future since such states are most certainly going to decay by particle emission ( see @xcite ) .",
    "marked progress has been made in many traditional and novels subjects of nuclear cluster physics .",
    "the developments in these subjects show the importance of clustering among the basic modes of motion of nuclear many - body systems .",
    "all these open questions will require precise coincidence measurements @xcite coupled with state - of - the - art theory .",
    "this review article is dedicated to the memory of my friends alex szanto de toledo and valery zagrebaev who unexpectelly passed away in early 2015 .",
    "i am very pleased to first acknowledge walter greiner ( who celebrated his 80th birthday on october 29th , 2015 ) for his continuous support of the cluster physics @xcite .",
    "i would like also to thank christian caron ( springer ) for initiating in 2008 the series of the three volumes of _ lecture notes in physics _ entitled `` clusters in nuclei '' and edited between 2010 and 2014 @xcite .",
    "all the authors of the 19 chapters of these volumes are warmly thanked for their fruitfull collaboration during the course of the project which is still in progress .",
