    "it is well known that , if four dimensional physics arises from higher dimensional theories , then the presumably fundamental constants of the four dimensional theory are actually time dependent .",
    "it is therefore particularly relevant to search for these variations and for possible correlations with striking features of the universe evolution .",
    "characterization of these correlations may , in turn , provide relevant hints on the nature of the main constituents of the universe , namely dark matter and dark energy .",
    "evidence suggesting that , for instance , the proton - electron mass ratio has varied has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "this arises from comparison of the absorption spectra of @xmath7 in the laboratory with that of two clouds of @xmath7 about @xmath8 light years away .",
    "furthermore , the observation of the spectra of quasars ( qsos ) seems to indicate a time - dependent fine structure parameter @xcite .",
    "such observations lead to , for @xmath9 @xcite , = ( -0.540.12)10 ^ -5  , [ murphy ] at @xmath10 .",
    "more recent observations suggest , however , that for @xmath11 @xcite , = ( -0.060.06)10 ^ -5  , [ chand ] at @xmath12 .",
    "the oklo natural reactor also provides a bound on the variation of the electromagnetic coupling , at @xmath13 cl , for @xmath14 @xcite -0.910 ^ -7<<1.210 ^ -7  .",
    "[ oklo ]    estimates of the age of iron meteorites , corresponding to @xmath15 , combined with a measurement of the os / re ratio resulting from the radioactive decay @xmath16 , yields @xcite : = ( -88)10 ^ -7  , [ meteorites1 ] at @xmath17 , and -2410 ^ -7<<810 ^ -7  , [ meteorites2 ] at @xmath18 .    observations of the hyperfine frequencies of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 atoms in their electronic ground state , using several laser cooled atomic fountain clocks , gives , at present ( @xmath21 ) : < 4.2 10 ^ -15  ^-1  , where the dot represents differentiation with respect to cosmic time .",
    "stricter bounds arise from the measurement of the @xmath22 transition of the atomic hydrogen and comparison with a previous measurement with respect to the ground state hyperfine splitting in @xmath23cs and combination with the drift of an optical transition frequency in @xmath24hg@xmath25 , which yields : = ( -0.9 4.2 ) 10 ^ -15  ^-1  .    as already pointed out , a spacetime dependence on the fine structure parameter arises naturally in higher dimensional fundamental theories , as shown in several theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore relevant to deepen the experimental observations and search for realistic models that allow for such variation .",
    "recent observations clearly indicate that the universe is undergoing a period of accelerated expansion @xcite , which suggests that it is dominated by a form of energy density with negative pressure usually referred to as dark energy . the most obvious candidate to explain this accelerated expansion is an uncanceled cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "this is , of course , problematic as it involves a serious fine - tuning difficulty .",
    "other possible explanations include quintessence - type models @xcite with one @xcite or two @xcite scalar fields , k - essence @xcite and exotic equations of state like in the case of the chaplygin gas and its generalized version @xcite .    in this context",
    ", it is relevant to question whether these two observational facts are related .",
    "this issue has already been addressed in the context of quintessence models @xcite , @xmath26 supergravity models @xcite , dirac - born - infeld inspired models @xcite and a lorentz invariance violating model @xcite .",
    "given that scalar fields are a common feature in most of the above mentioned approaches , one considers the coupling of such a scalar field to electromagnetism and hence a variation of the fine structure parameter , @xmath27 , can arise @xcite .",
    "the bounds expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ murphy])-([meteorites2 ] ) allows one to place constraints on the coupling .    for sure , the standard model of particle physics does not fix the coupling between the scalar field and electromagnetism ,",
    "hence it is relevant to analyze some realistic alternatives . in particular",
    ", we consider the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) since it is a promising possibility from the phenomenological point of view @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the gcg model and study the coupling with electromagnetism . in section",
    "iii we use experimental data to constrain the model .",
    "we present our conclusions in section iv .",
    "the gcg model considers an exotic perfect fluid described by the equation of state @xcite p = -  , [ gcges ] where @xmath3 is a positive constant and @xmath4 is a constant in the range @xmath28 .",
    "the covariant conservation of the energy - momentum tensor for an homogeneous and isotropic spacetime implies that in terms of the scale factor , @xmath29 : _ ch = ^  .",
    "[ gcgrho ]      following ref .",
    "@xcite , we describe the gcg through a real scalar field .",
    "we start with the lagrangian density = ^2-v ( )  , [ reall ] where the potential , for a flat universe , has the form @xcite v = v_0e^3(-1 )  , [ realv ] where @xmath30 is a constant and @xmath31 .    for the energy density of the field",
    "we have _ = ^2+v()=^=_ch  . [ realrho ]    using eq .",
    "( [ gcges ] ) , we can write the pressure as follows p_=^2-v()=-  , [ realp ]    and then ^2=  , [ realphi1 ] which , after integration , yields in terms of the redshift , once one assumes that at present , @xmath32 :    ( z)=ln  .",
    "[ integratedphi ]    it is easy to show that , at present    _ 0=ln ( )  .",
    "[ phi0 ]      we consider now the interaction between the scalar and the electromagnetic field following a proposal by bekenstein @xcite    _ em = f()f_f^  , where @xmath33 is an arbitrary function .",
    "given that the variation of the electromagnetic coupling is small , we expand this function up to first order f()=  , where @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "it follows that fine structure parameter , @xmath27 , is given by _",
    "em = ^-1=_em 0  , [ alpha2 ] and hence , for its variation , we obtain = ( -_0 )  .",
    "[ delta2 ]    the rate of variation of @xmath4 at present is given by = - h_0  , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the hubble constant .",
    "we should take in account the equivalence principle experiments , which implies @xcite 7 10 ^ -4  , [ zetaf ] where @xmath34 gives , at first order , the coupling between the scalar and electromagnetic fields .     for @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( top to bottom ) .",

    "the box and the redshifts correspond to the bounds provided by atomic clocks ( @xmath38 ; bottom to top),width=264 ]",
    "we choose the hubble constant , @xmath39 , and adjust the coupling parameter , @xmath34 , for different values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in order to satisfy the bounds on the evolution of @xmath27 .",
    "considering the set of parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 , with @xmath40 and for @xmath41 , we find consistency with both meteorite and atomic clocks bounds . however , the model does not fit qso and oklo data with this set of parameters .",
    "we have to take @xmath42 to obtain consistency with all bounds considered here . in this case , however , the degeneracy on both parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , is considerable , that is , any values in the range @xmath43 and @xmath44 are consistent with data . figures [ fig : resultsqso ] , [ fig : resultsoklo ] , [ fig : resultsmeteo ] and [ fig : resultsatomic ] summarize our results for @xmath37 and @xmath45 , for several values of @xmath4 in the range @xmath43 .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the implications of the coupling to electromagnetism of a scalar field model that describes in an unified fashion dark energy and dark matter , the gcg model .",
    "the experimental bounds provided for such variation , namely qsos , oklo s natural reactor , meteorite and atomic clocks , were used to constrain the model .",
    "we find that the model is consistent with qso , oklo , meteorite and atomic clocks bounds simultaneously for @xmath46 , for any value of the gcg s parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the ranges @xmath28 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "moreover , in order to be consistent with the data , @xmath34 must be about three orders of magnitude smaller than the upper bound implied by the equivalence principle ( cf . eq .",
