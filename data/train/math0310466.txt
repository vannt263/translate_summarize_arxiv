    "belk and bux show that this cayley graph is additionally not minimally almost convex @xcite , and guba uses it to show that the dehn function of the group is quadratic @xcite .",
    "burillo @xcite , guba @xcite and belk and brown @xcite have considered the growth of the group by trying to estimate the size of balls in this cayley graph as well .    the goal of this paper is to exhibit a family of elements in @xmath0 which :    * show the difficulty of constructing canonical minimal length representatives for elements of @xmath0 , and * exhibit the failure of this cayley graph to satisfy the @xmath6-fellow traveller property for geodesics originating at the identity , and thus show that this graph is not combable by geodesics .",
    "we approach the problem of the existence of canonical minimal length representatives for elements of @xmath0 in this generating set by considering the conditions under which certain generators decrease the word length of elements . in a free group with a free generating set",
    ", there is always a unique generator which reduces the word length of a nontrivial element @xmath7 . in groups with relations , understanding",
    "which generators reduce word length of given elements can give insight into the geometry of the group .",
    "let @xmath8 be the cayley graph of @xmath0 with respect to the finite generating set @xmath9 .",
    "all word lengths in the arguments below are computed with respect to this generating set .",
    "our approach towards the construction of minimal length representatives for group elements is to follow fordham s outline and begin with @xmath10 , then find a generator @xmath11 so that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes word length with respect to this generating set .",
    "iteration of this process will construct minimal length representatives , and a natural goal is to find a canonical way to proceed at elements for which several generators decrease word length .",
    "we describe below a class of ` seesaw ' words with the following property .",
    "if @xmath10 is a seesaw word , then there is a unique generator @xmath14 so that @xmath3 and @xmath15 are the only two generators which decrease the word length of @xmath7 , that is , @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , only @xmath3 decreases the word length of @xmath17 for many iterations , and similarly only @xmath15 decreases the word length of @xmath18 for many iterations .",
    "the existence of these words eliminates the possibility of a choice of geodesics from the identity to each elements satisfying the @xmath6-fellow traveller property .",
    "we view elements of @xmath0 as pairs of finite rooted binary trees , each with the same number of leaves . to see the equivalence of this with the group presentation , we refer the reader to cannon , floyd and parry @xcite .",
    "we view our trees as consisting of a collection of ` carets ' , which are interior nodes together with their two downward - directed edges .",
    "a leaf ending in a vertex of valence one is called an _ exposed leaf_. a caret may have a right child or a left child , if either or both of its leaves are not exposed .",

    "[ fig : x0x1],title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +    there is a natural reduction condition on tree pair diagrams to ensure a unique tree pair diagram representing each group element .",
    "namely , a tree pair diagram @xmath21 is unreduced if there is a caret with two exposed leaves , numbered @xmath22 and @xmath23 in both trees of a tree pair diagram , and reduced otherwise . to create a reduced representative for an element ,",
    "we simply remove these common carets and renumber the exposed leaves .",
    "we will assume below that if @xmath24 , then the pair of trees is reduced .",
    "we refer to @xmath25 as the _ negative tree _ of the pair , and @xmath26 as the _ positive tree_.    there is an analytic interpretation of @xmath0 as a group of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval , subject to the following two conditions :    1 .",
    "the slope of each linear piece is a power of two , and 2 .",
    "the discontinuities of slope occur at points whose coordinates are dyadic rationals .    the carets in a binary rooted tree can be considered as instructions for dyadic subdivision of the unit interval .",
    "this gives an equivalence between tree pair diagrams and the dyadic piecewise linear homeomorphisms described above , where the trees in the tree pair diagram are used to determine the domain and range subdivisions for the homeomorphism .    with the analytic interpretation of @xmath0 ,",
    "group multiplication is equivalent to composition of bijective functions . in order to multiply tree pair diagrams ,",
    "one mimics the condition of bijective function composition which requires that the range of one function be the domain of the other .",
    "namely , to multiply @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we create unreduced representatives of the two elements , @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , in which @xmath31 .",
    "the product @xmath32 is then represented by the ( not necessarily reduced ) tree pair diagram @xmath33 . see cannon , floyd and parry @xcite and cleary and taback @xcite for details and examples of group multiplication of tree pair diagrams .",
    "viewing elements of @xmath0 as tree pair diagrams , we use fordham s method @xcite for computing the word length of @xmath10 with respect to the standard finite generating set @xmath9 directly from the tree pair diagram representing @xmath7 .",
    "we now describe this remarkable method .",
    "fordham begins by dividing the carets in a binary rooted tree into distinct types , roughly left , right and interior .",
    "the left side of the tree is the path of left edges beginning at the root caret ; the right side is defined analogously .",
    "left ( respectively right ) carets have one leaf on the left ( respectively right ) side of the tree .",
    "the root caret of the tree is always considered a left caret .",
    "first , the carets are numbered using an infix numbering scheme , beginning with zero . according to this infix order ,",
    "the left child of a caret is numbered before the caret , and any right child is numbered after the caret .",
    "figure [ fig : treepairexample ] provides an example of a tree pair diagram with exposed leaves numbered from left to right , and carets numbered in infix order in each tree .     with carets and leaves numbered .",
    "[ fig : treepairexample],title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] +    fordham s caret types are as follows :    1 .",
    "the first caret on the left side of the tree , farthest away from the root caret .",
    "every nonempty tree has exactly one caret of type @xmath34 , and it will always have infix number zero . 2 .   @xmath35 .",
    "any other left caret .",
    "3 .   @xmath36 .",
    "an interior caret which has no right child .",
    "an interior caret which has a right child .",
    "a right caret numbered @xmath6 with the property that caret @xmath39 is an interior caret .",
    "@xmath40 . a right caret with no higher - numbered interior carets . 7 .",
    "@xmath41 . a right caret which is neither an @xmath38 nor an @xmath40 caret .",
    "let @xmath10 be represented by the tree pair diagram @xmath21 .",
    "fordham forms pairs of caret types by associating the carets in @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the same caret number ; for example , the first pair consists of the type of caret zero in @xmath25 and the type of caret zero in @xmath26 which will necessarily be @xmath42 .",
    "each pair of caret types is assigned a weight from the following table .",
    "notice that the pattern of weights in the table is symmetric around the diagonal .",
    "the pair @xmath42 is assigned weight @xmath43 and does not appear in the table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fordham then proves the following theorem .",

    "fordham proves a lemma which says that if the trees in a tree pair diagram @xmath48 have the ` correct ' shape , then multiplication by a generator will alter at most one pair of caret types in @xmath21 .",
    "these conditions are seen to be necessary when one tries to perform the multiplication by creating unreduced representatives for the element @xmath7 and the generator .",
    "[ lemma : conditions ] let @xmath21 be a reduced pair of trees , each having @xmath49 carets , representing an element @xmath50 , and @xmath3 a generator in @xmath51 .    1 .",

    "then the reduced tree pair diagram for @xmath56 also has @xmath49 carets , and there is exactly one @xmath57 with @xmath58 so that the pair of caret types of caret @xmath57 changes when @xmath3 is applied to @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , fordham shows that if the requirements of lemma [ lemma : conditions ] are not met , then there is one additional caret in the reduced tree pair diagram for @xmath56 and @xmath60 .",
