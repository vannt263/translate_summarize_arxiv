    "coupled quantum dots ( qds ) are of particular interest for spin - based quantum computation because quantum logic gates ( such as a controlled - not gate ) can be realized via the interaction between two spin quantum bits ( qubits ) , i.e. , the spins of two electrons , each trapped in an individual quantum dot@xcite . in such devices , the interaction between the two spins is proportional to the exchange energy @xmath0 , which is equivalent to the splitting between the lowest singlet and triplet two - electron states .",
    "extensive theoretical and experimental works have been done to study the exchange interaction in coupled semiconductor qd systems . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", variational methods such as the heitler - london method or exact diagonalization are commonly used to obtain the dependence of the exchange interaction on the system parameters , e.g. , the inter - dot separation , the tunneling barrier between the qds , and the externally applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the extraction of the exchange interaction relies on the charge stability diagram in which the boundaries between distinctive stable charge states , i.e. , between the states with fixed number of electrons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) in each of the coupled dots , are represented as functions of the two controlling gate biases , one for each dot @xcite . to obtain @xmath0 ,",
    "two different methods were used : one is based on the hubbard model , which involves the analysis of double - triplet point ( dtp ) separation on the stability diagram @xcite ; the other utilizes zeeman splitting to measure the exchange energy as a function of inter - dot detuning in a coherent control cycle of state preparation , spin - interaction , and projective readout in laterally coupled semiconductor quantum dot systems @xcite .",
    "in such an experiment , the charge state of the two qubits is manipulated through a charging cycle from the @xmath3 state to the @xmath4 state and finally back to the @xmath3 state in a coherent way .",
    "these kinds of experiments are stimulating interest in the investigation of the exchange interaction and the associated charge re - distribution as a function of inter - dot bias detuning in coupled qds .",
    "in experimental planar laterally coupled quantum dot device structures , the strength of the confining potentials in the coupling direction and the direction perpendicular to it in the plane of the two - dimensional electron gas are different due to the top gate patterning @xcite . in this paper , we account for this effect and study coupled quantum dots with different aspect ratios in the confinement potential , i.e. , with different ratios of the confinement strengths in the two directions .",
    "we introduce our model gaussian - shaped confinement potential and exact diagonalization method in section ii . in section iii , we discuss the different dependences of the exchange interaction on the magnetic fields for different dot deformations .",
    "we then analyze the stability diagram for various coupled qd systems followed by a comparison of the dependences of the exchange energy on inter - dot detuning for dots with different aspect ratios and their relationship to electron density localization .",
    "finally , we present concluding remarks in section iv .",
    "we use the following model potential to describe the coupled quantum dot system @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the depth of the left and right dots ( equivalent to the qd gate voltages in experimental structures @xcite ) which can be independently varied , @xmath8 is the inter - dot separation , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the extension of the each dot in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 direction , respectively .",
    "our computational approach consists of two steps @xcite . in the first step ,",
    "we solve a single - particle problem with the hamiltonian @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the electron effective mass in gaas , and @xmath15 $ ] is the vector potential of the magnetic field @xmath16 oriented perpendicular to the @xmath17-plane .",
    "this hamiltonian is diagonalized in the basis of the product of two harmonic oscillator states in each direction , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) denotes the @xmath21-th ( @xmath22-th ) harmonic oscillator states ( in this work , we use eight harmonic states in each direction ) .    in the second step ,",
    "we solve the two - particle problem for which the hamiltonian is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 accounts for the coulomb interaction between the two electrons and @xmath25 is gaas dieletric constant .",
    "the zeeman effect is not included in ( 3 ) since its effect trivially lowers the energy of the triplet state by @xmath26 mev / t while leaving the energy of the singlet state unaltered so that it can be readily accounted for later , if necessary .",
    "the diagonalization procedure for the two - particle hamiltonian is performed by expanding two - electron spinless wave function in the basis @xmath27 , \\label{eqn : twowf}\\ ] ] which is symmetric for singlet ( @xmath28 ) state and antisymmetric for triplet ( @xmath29 ) state .",
    "the summation is carried over @xmath30 for the singlet and @xmath31 for the triplet .    from the two - particle wave function , we compute the electron density as    @xmath32    the chemical potential of the structure is related to the total energy of the system as  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 [ note that @xmath35 is the ground state energy of the @xmath36-electron state .",

    "other parameters for the model potential are @xmath47 mev , @xmath48 nm . it is observed that the magnitudes of maximum and minimum values of the exchange energy are larger for a larger aspect ratio @xmath52 because of enhanced inter - dot coupling . as the aspect ratio @xmath52 increases , the magnetic fields at the singlet - triplet transition point , at the exchange energy minimum , and at the saturation point of exchange energy all shift to smaller values , leading to a more compressed appearance of the curve in the horizontal direction .",
    "fig : fig1](b ) , as the aspect ratio increases from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , the exchange energy maximum [ @xmath55 ramps up slowly from @xmath56 to @xmath57 @xmath58ev , while the magnetic field at the singlet - triplet transition point [ @xmath59 decreases more rapidly from @xmath60 to @xmath61 t. for spin - based quantum computing , a larger @xmath62 and a smaller @xmath63 are both desirable because they offer better control of the quantum logic gate @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig1](a ) that at @xmath65 t , the values of the exchange energy for dots of different aspect ratios are very close to each other ( @xmath66 @xmath58ev ) , which implies that at this magnetic field geometric factor plays a minor role in determining the exchange energy .",

    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denotes the controlling gate bias for the left ( right ) dot .",
    "the lower curved branch ( solid line ) corresponds to the bias condition under which the chemical potential of the first electron in the quantum dot [ @xmath72 , shown by the solid line inside the confining potential ] is aligned with the source and drain chemical potentials @xmath73 and @xmath74 and the first electron enters the system . here , we consider the situation close to equilibrium , so in a first approximation we assume @xmath75 . when @xmath6 and @xmath7 are increased , the chemical potential for the second electron [ @xmath76 , shown by the dotted line inside the confining potential ] are lowered and aligned with @xmath75 and the second electron is charged into the coupled dots .",
    "the upper curved branch ( solid line ) corresponds to this situation .",
    "the separation along the main diagonal between the lower and upper branches is called the double - triple point ( dtp ) separation ( also called the anti - crossing separation ) @xcite . the number in the parentheses on the left ( right ) gives the electron number on the left ( right ) dot in distinct stable charge regions .    in our simulation , we choose a fixed reference value of the source and drain chemical potentials [ @xmath77 mev ] , and plot on the same diagram the chemical potential contours for the first and second electrons with respect to two controlling gate biases so as to obtain the charge stability diagram .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](b ) shows the chemical potential contours for the first electron @xmath72 ( lower branches ) and for two electron singlet @xmath67 ( upper branches ) for @xmath48 nm and @xmath68 ( dotted ) , @xmath69 ( dashed ) , and @xmath54 ( solid ) with @xmath9 fixed at @xmath78 nm at zero magnetic field .",
    "as the aspect ratio decreases , the single - particle eigenenergies increase as a result of stronger confinement in each dot , hence the chemical potential contours shift from the lower left corner to the upper right corner .",
    "the dtp separation is @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 mev for @xmath43 , @xmath69 , and @xmath54 , respectively . according to the `` classical '' theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , a larger dtp separation signifies a stronger inter - dot coupling strength .",
    "therefore , the inter - dot coupling strength is larger for a larger aspect ratio , which is consistent with the above result of a larger exchange energy value at zero magnetic field found for @xmath82 [ see fig . [",

    "the exchange energy at different magnetic fields is almost invariant over the @xmath6 interval from 21 to 29 mev .",
    "but for @xmath88 mev , it increases superlinearly for magnetic field @xmath89 t and decreases superlinearly at @xmath90 t. for @xmath91 and 6 t , the @xmath0 saturation is seen as well .",
    "the onset of superlinearity is consistent with the difference in the electron density between the singlet and triplet states . as shown below in column ( ii ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , as @xmath6 becomes larger , the electron density of the singlet state becomes localized in the left dot while the electron density of the triplet state continues to be spread over the two dots .",
    "the difference in electron density and the corresponding elecron - electron interaction becomes larger with the increasing inter - dot detuning , and hence , the magnitude of the exchange energy increases .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the dependence of the exchange energy on @xmath6 at @xmath86 mev , for coupled elliptic dots ( @xmath40 nm , @xmath92 nm , @xmath48 nm ) at different magnetic fields . the qualitative behavior of the exchange energy for @xmath42 is similiar to that for @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , except that saturation occurs for all the investigated magnetic fields at smaller inter - dot detuning . in general , the onset of exchange energy saturation occurs when the inter - dot detuning is so large that the electrons in both singlet and triplet states starts to localize in the same dot and the difference in the electron density between these states becomes smaller .",
    "we observe that exchange energy saturation occurs for @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) mev for @xmath41 in the absence of the magnetic field ( not shown ) .",
    "this detuning value for the onset of exchange energy saturation is larger than that for the @xmath42 case because for @xmath42 the effective size of each dot is larger and the electron density for both the singlet and triplet states more easily localize into a single dot .",
