    "at luminosities above @xmath12 , infrared galaxies become the most numerous objects in the local universe ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the trigger for the intense infrared emission appears to be the strong interaction or merger of molecular gas - rich spirals .",
    "galaxies at the highest infrared luminosities ( @xmath14 ) , known as ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , appear to be advanced merger systems and may represent an important stage in the formation of quasi - stellar objects @xcite .    the bulk of the energy radiated by these sources is infrared emission from warm dust grains heated by a central power source or sources .",
    "the critical question concerning these galaxies is whether the dust is heated by a nuclear starburst , or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , or a combination of both .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopic studies on a sample of ulirgs by @xcite , suggest that 70%80% of these galaxies are powered predominantly by recently formed massive stars , and 20%30% by a central agn .",
    "these authors conclude further that at least half of these ulirgs are probably powered by both an agn and a starburst in a 12  kpc diameter circumnuclear disk or ring",
    ". the most direct evidence to date of sub - kpc nuclear starburst regions in ulirgs is the discovery of luminous radio supernovae and supernova remnants in both arp  220 @xcite and mrk  273 @xcite , using vlbi observations .    in this paper",

    "the total flux density of the source at this resolution is 100  mjy , consistent with the value measured by @xcite at 1.425  ghz with the vla - b array .",
    "an important question regarding these observations is whether the extended emission is likely diffuse , or composed of many point sources as might be expected for a nuclear starburst . due to the incomplete uv coverage in vlbi observations , especially for a source at @xmath36 declination , the clean algorithm tends to generate spurious point sources when deconvolving extended emission regions at high resolution . on the other hand ,",
    "it is plausible that the extended emission is indeed composed of mostly faint point sources , in view of the likely starburst nature of iras  172080014 . to resolve this ambiguity , we tested two other imaging algorithms : the multi - scale clean and the maximum entropy method ( mem ) , by generating two artificial data sets in aips++ with the same u - v sampling , weights and sky positions as our target source .",
    "such simulations give us confidence in the reliability of the results obtained from the real observations .",
    "the first data set was composed of multiple point sources and an extended source , and the second was composed of three extended sources . while the mem gave very poor images for the set with compact sources and relatively poor results on the set with large sources , the multi - scale clean successfully imaged both data sets without exhibiting any tendency to generate spurious point sources .",
    "thus , we imaged the actual observations of our target source at high resolution ( figure  2 ) using the multi - scale clean algorithm as implemented in the aips++ tool `` imager '' , with a grid weighting @xmath37 .",
    "figure  2 has a resolution of @xmath38  mas ( @xmath39  pc ) and represents the same region as in figure  1 .",

    "we selected this conservative limit because only these sources were consistently reproduced in the total intensity ( stokes  i ) , and in the individual rr and ll images , with comparable flux densities .",

    "the average size of these compact sources is @xmath58  mas ( @xmath59  pc ) , and their brightness temperatures are between ( 2.26.6)@xmath1  k , indicating the emission is non - thermal and not from h  ii regions .",
    "the non - thermal emission in nuclear starburst galaxies is usually attributed to synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated in supernova remnant shocks @xcite .      a remarkably tight and linear correlation between the total radio continuum emission and the far - ir luminosities ( @xmath60 ) is well known in `` normal '' galaxies where the main energy source is not due to a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "the most obvious interpretation of this correlation is the presence of massive stars that both provide relativistic particles via supernova events , and heat the interstellar dust which radiates in fir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the ratio of infrared to radio luminosity is expressed by the quantity @xmath61 as defined by helou et al .",

    "values of @xmath61 less than 1.64 would indicate the presence of a radio loud agn @xcite .",
    "thus , based on the radio - fir correlation , it would appear that iras  172080014 is dominated by a starburst .",
    "an estimate of the massive star formation rate and the supernova rate for a starburst galaxy can be obtained in two independent ways .",
    "the first is a theoretical approach which assumes an initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite , and the second is based on an empirical relationship between the observed non - thermal radio flux density and the supernova rate in the galaxy @xcite .    for the theoretical approach ,",
    "we assume a modified miller - scalo imf of the form @xmath70 .",
    "this function is truncated at @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the models presented by @xcite give the following relationship between the luminosity of the starburst and the star formation rate ( @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the lower and upper mass limits for star formation , respectively , @xmath77 is the lifetime of the starburst , and @xmath78 and 0.55 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",

    ", we use the lower and upper mass arguments obtained for arp  220 , the prototype ulirg which has a very similar @xmath61 value to our galaxy . for arp  220",
    "an upper limit mass was set from free - free emission and pa@xmath85 observations and the lower mass limit was set from the co dynamical mass measurements and the adopted disk model ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these limits are @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it has also been found that the far - ir luminosity is a good measure of the bolometric luminosity produced by fairly massive @xmath88 young stars @xcite .",
    "thus , with these mass limits , we can state that @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting star formation rate ( equation  3 ) is @xmath90 , and the supernova rate ( equation  4 ) is @xmath91 .    as an alternative",
    ", we can derive these rates using the empirical approach of @xcite , which is based on the observed galactic non - thermal luminosity ( @xmath92 ) and the supernova rate @xmath81 .",
    "this relationship is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the non - thermal spectral index for `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "our 52  mjy total vlbi flux density for iras  172080014 , which is mostly non - thermal , corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath95 . from equation",
    "( 5 ) , we get @xmath96 , and from equation(4 ) we get a massive star formation rate of @xmath97 , assuming the mass constraints as for arp  220 .",
    "these values are lower than the rates obtained from the far - ir luminosity by a factor of 2.6 , and suggest that there might be non - thermal diffuse emission which is not detected by our vlbi array .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the observed fraction of thermal emission in `` normal '' galaxies is @xmath98 at 1.4  ghz .",
    "thus , a reasonable approximation would be to consider the total vla flux density , which is 100  mjy , to be non - thermal .",
    "then , following the above argument with the luminosity @xmath99 that corresponds to the detected vla flux density , we obtain @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these values are more consistent with the rates obtained from the far - ir luminosity using similar mass limits , and support the suggestion that there is undetected diffuse flux in our vlbi observations .",
    "we averaged the rates obtained from both the far - ir luminosity and the vla radio flux density to obtain our best estimates for the massive star formation rate in iras  172080014 , @xmath3@xmath102 , and the supernova rate @xmath3@xmath103 .",
    "the derived star formation and supernova rates are consistent with the rates in the ulirg arp 220 , where @xcite obtained a star formation rate of @xmath104 , and a supernova rate of @xmath105 in vlbi observations at 18 cm .",
    "our supernova rate is much higher than the upper limit of 0.3  yr@xmath5 that @xcite derived for the nearby starburst galaxy ngc  253 from higher - frequency vla observations .",
    "follow - up vlbi observations will make it possible to look for new sources ( i.e.  rsne ) to directly constrain both the supernova and the massive star formation rates in the nuclear starburst region of iras  172080014 .",
    "an estimate of the magnetic field strength and the pressure of the relativistic electrons responsible for the synchrotron radiation detected from the starburst region can be obtained by minimizing the summed energy in magnetic fields and relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "the resulting magnetic field is @xmath3@xmath106gauss , and the corresponding pressure is @xmath3@xmath107  dyn  @xmath9 , indicating extreme physical conditions compared to the disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "the vlbi continuum emission in iras  172080014 extends over a region of @xmath0  pc , and can be explained in part by synchrotron radiation from aged supernova remnants ( snrs ) , but this region is also punctuated by a number of bright compact sources ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the radio spectral luminosities of these sources range over @xmath108 at 1.362  ghz , and are at least an order of magnitude greater than the brightest radio supernovae ( rsne ) seen in m  82 @xcite , but comparable to the rare class of extreme luminosity rsne characterized by sn  1986j in ngc  891 @xcite and sn  1979c @xcite .",
    "more recently , a substantial population of such luminous rsne was discovered in arp  220 by @xcite , who suggest that the high luminosities of those rsne may indicate denser environments , more massive progenitors , or stronger magnetic fields relative to typical rsne .",
    "the compact sources revealed in our observations are a few times brighter and larger in size than the rsne reported in the ulirgs arp  220 @xcite and mrk  273 @xcite .",
    "thus , we presume that the compact sources in the starburst region of iras  17208 - 0014 are clustered young snrs and/or luminous rsne .",
    "support for the clumpy nature of the nuclear region in iras  172080014 is provided by the high resolution near - ir images obtained with the hubble space telescope nicmos camera @xcite .",
    "these images , with resolutions between @xmath109 and @xmath110 , reveal numerous extremely luminous clusters of massive stars in the inner 1  kpc region of this galaxy .",
    "smith et al.(1998a ) have fitted smooth gaussian and clumped models of starburst distributions to the observed visibility functions of 11 luminous and ultra - luminous ir galaxies .",
    "their first conclusion was that starbursts with standard rsne are incapable of producing the radio power and structure of these galaxies .",
    "for luminous rsne models , the gaussian fits represented the visibility function poorly , but the clustered models , which assumed simultaneous detonation of the rsne within one clump , were more successful . excluding poor solutions , the sizes of these clumps ranged over 115  pc in diameter , and the number of supernovae per clump was between 2 and 12 .",
    "these clumps are at least two times smaller than the minimum sizes implied by the gaussian fits to our compact sources ( table  2 ) .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the compact sources in our high resolution image are mainly powered by very luminous individual rsne .",
    "@xcite fit the following expression for the post - maximum light curve of luminous rsne : @xmath111 where @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the detonation time . following their discussion , individual rsne will lie above our @xmath114 detection level for 7 years .",
    "given our adopted supernova rate of 4  yr@xmath5 , we expect to see about 28 individual luminous rsne , in remarkable agreement with the 25 compact sources revealed in our observations .",
    "future multi - epoch vlbi observations would determine which of the two above assumptions better explain the nature of the compact components in iras  172080014 .",
    "the wide h  i absorption observed against the whole extent of the nuclear region in iras  172080014 , with a full width of @xmath115 at 20% maximum , is common in ulirgs .",
    "similar wide absorption lines have been found in arp  220 @xcite , mrk  273 @xcite , and mrk  231 @xcite .",
    "the present observations are consistent with the nanay 300  m meridian telescope observations by @xcite , who found a broad h  i absorption ( @xmath116 ) centered at @xmath117 .",
    "the detected peak absorption flux density in our observations is @xmath118  mjy , about 72% of the single dish detection .",
    "our observations reveal the details of the h  i absorption against the radio emission in iras  172080014 ( figures  3 , 4 , 5 , & 6 ) .",
    "the absorption is complex , and composed of five main features ( table  3 ) .",
    "three of them are wide ( @xmath119 ) with @xmath120 , and the other two relatively narrow ( @xmath121 ) with @xmath122 .",
    "these two narrow lines appear to be localized features on the east edge and the north - east side of the continuum emission region ( figure  4 ) , suggesting the existence of quiescent h  i clouds in the ism of the galaxy .",
    "the linear extent of these two features is @xmath123  kpc , as seen in the optical depth images ( figure  4 ) .",

    "a similar model was proposed for the absorbing neutral hydrogen in mrk  231 , where the observed h  i disk was identified as the inner region of the molecular gas seen in co @xmath127 emission @xcite .",
    "it is likely that both atomic and molecular gas exist in the region where the h  i absorption is detected .",
    "the emission detected in low spatial resolution ( fwhm @xmath130 ) co observations arises from larger scales , and would not show variations on the scales seen in the h  i absorption in iras  172080014 .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column densities of the observed absorption features are high , covering a range @xmath131 .",
    "the corresponding visual extinctions @xmath52 , assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio , are between 0.066  @xmath132 and 0.174  @xmath132  mag .",
    "the discussion in @xcite for arp  220 , with the infrared magnitudes obtained for iras",
    "17208 - 0014 @xcite , implies a visual extinction value of @xmath322  mag , comparable to the values derived from our h  i column densities with a spin temperature of @xmath133100 k.    our results show a very good agreement between the physical properties of the neutral h  i in iras  172080014 and in the other ulirgs previously observed in detail , namely arp  220 @xcite , mrk  273 @xcite and mrk  231 @xcite .",
    "the strong velocity gradients seen in the h  i absorption of these galaxies suggest rapidly rotating disks which are obscuring the radio - emitting nuclear regions , while the multiple absorption features seen against different regions of the continuum indicate the existence of several discrete clouds in those disks .",
    "we have presented the results of phase - referenced vlbi observations , using the vlba and the phased vla , of the 21  cm continuum emission and the h  i absorption in the central @xmath31.1  kpc of the very advanced merger galaxy iras  172080014 .",
    "the high resolution continuum images reveal the details of the previously undetected nuclear starburst region of this galaxy . both diffuse and compact continuum emission are detected .",
    "the total vlbi flux is 52  mjy , and represents only half of the total flux seen with the vla at a lower resolution , suggesting the existence of diffuse emission not detected by our vlbi array .",
    "the compact sources in the starburst region are more likely clustered luminous radio supernovae and supernova remnants , considering the h  ii spectra observed in this galaxy and its morphological similarities to other well - known starbursts .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that each of our compact sources is mainly powered by an individual bright rsn nested in a region that contains faded snrs .",
    "the brightness temperatures of the compact structures seen in these observations are @xmath134  k. the flux density of the brightest source in the starburst region is less than 3% of the total radio flux density .",
    "the results suggest that there is no radio - loud agn in the nuclear region of iras  172080014 .",
    "both the far - infrared luminosity and the radio continuum flux of this galaxy imply a massive star formation rate of @xmath3@xmath135 and supernova rate of @xmath3@xmath136 .",
    "the estimated individual luminous rsn number agrees surprisingly well with the number of the compact sources detected above 5@xmath137 level . from the minimum energy condition",
    ", we have estimated the pressure to be @xmath3@xmath138  dyn  @xmath9 and the magnetic field to be @xmath3@xmath106gauss in the starburst region .",
    "the very wide h  i absorption is composed of five components with velocity widths between 58 and 232  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the column densities of these absorption peaks are on the order of @xmath139 , and the derived visual extinctions are between @xmath140 and @xmath141  mag .",
    "the strongest velocity gradient in the h  i absorption is seen in position angle 120@xmath124 , as in the co @xmath127 emission .",
    "the h  i position - velocity profile in this position angle shows a velocity gradient of 1653  km  s@xmath5  kpc@xmath5 .",
    "the calculated dynamical mass , assuming keplerian motion , is @xmath142 , comparable to the enclosed mass obtained from co observations .",
    "the h  i absorption results suggest the existence of a neutral gas disk containing several clouds , situated inside a larger scale molecular disk as seen in the interferometric co @xmath127 emission line observations .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
