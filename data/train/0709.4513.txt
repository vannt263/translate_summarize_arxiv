    "downlink transmission in a multiple antenna setting is both a well studied and a complex problem with myriad parameters .",
    "a natural problem to be studied in this setting is to maximize throughput on the downlink while constraining the complexity at the terminals to be minimal .",
    "the problem of multi - antenna downlink transmission has been previously studied from many different perspectives @xcite . in many of these papers ,",
    "the channel is assumed to be known a - priori either perfectly or imperfectly at the base - station and/or terminals .",
    "the distinguishing feature of this paper is that we study the problem with no assumptions on channel knowledge both at the base - station and terminals ( users ) .",
    "in addition , we consider very realistic and difficult communication regime when the forward sinrs are low ( @xmath0 db ) .",
    "we consider this regime since interference from neighboring base - stations does not allow one to make sinrs larger .",
    "specifically , the scenario we study is the following : an @xmath1-element antenna array at the base - station , and single antennas at the @xmath2 autonomous terminals as shown in fig .",
    "[ figsysmodel ] .",
    "the channel is assumed to undergo block fading with a coherence interval of @xmath3 symbols . a time - division duplex ( tdd ) operation is considered . in a tdd system , the reverse channel and forward channel share a reciprocity relationship .",
    "our system model is a generalization of the system model considered in @xcite .",
    "we look at the net impact of training , estimation , scheduling and pre - conditioning on the throughput of the system .        the use of multiple antennas instead of single antennas at the transmitter and receiver in a point - to - point communication system has been shown to greatly improve the capacity of the wireless channels @xcite .",
    "later , the sum capacity of the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) gaussian broadcast channel has been shown to be achieved by dirty paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that dpc actually characterizes the full capacity region of the mimo gaussian broadcast channel @xcite .",
    "in addition to the assumption that channel is perfectly known at the transmitter and the receivers , dpc scheme requires enormous computational power making it challenging to implement in practice .",
    "motivated by this , many precoding and scheduling schemes have been proposed to obtain near - optimal performance with low complexity in certain scenarios @xcite . however , these schemes are not applicable to the scenario we consider .",
    "we first look at the homogeneous users scenario , where all users have same forward and same reverse signal to interference - plus - noise ratios ( sinrs ) , and obtain a rigorous lower bound on the sum capacity .",
    "the lower bound obtained in this paper is tighter than the lower bound given in @xcite .",
    "the improvement comes from the scheduling strategy used which is simple , and in fact even considerably reduces the computational complexity of pre - conditioning . in this context",
    ", we also study the problem of optimizing the training sequence length and the number of users to maximize net throughput of the system .",
    "next , we look at the more general heterogeneous users scenario and study the problem of maximizing achievable weighted - sum rate . we propose a modified pre - conditioning method and obtain an optimized pre - conditioning matrix under @xmath1-large assumption .",
