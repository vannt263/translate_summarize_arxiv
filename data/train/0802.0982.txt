    "a common geometry used for transport studies in quantum dots consists of two leads weakly coupled to a quantum dot ( qd ) via tunneling barriers .",

    "this system ( dot coupled to fm leads ) was recently experimentally realized in the context of semiconductor quantum dots@xcite and molecules.@xcite a wealth of novel spin - dependent effects has been observed in this system due to the interplay of quantum confinement , coulomb correlations , pauli principle and lead - polarization alignments . for instance , novel effects such as spin - accumulation,@xcite spin - diode,@xcite spin - blockade,@xcite spin - current ringing,@xcite negative differential conductance and negative tmr,@xcite and so on , arise in this context . in order to obtain additional information , not contained in the average current , shot noise has also been analyzed in several spintronic systems .",
    "a few exemples include shot noise in spin - valve junctions@xcite and quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads.@xcite    here we apply the keldysh non - equilibrium technique to study spin - polarized transport ( current and shot noise ) in a fm - qd - fm system ( fig .",

    "we find an interplay between spin accumulation and coulomb interaction that gives rise to a bias dependent current polarization @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath0 can be suppressed or enhanced and have its sign changed , depending on the magnetic alignment and the bias voltage .",

    "in particular , it is possible to have an unpolarized emitter - current and a polarized collector - current .",

    "if the spin - flip is fast enough ( faster than the into / out tunneling processes ) the first electron can return to its original state ( via another spin - flip ) , instead of tunneling out of the dot .",

    "we find that for distinct ferromagnetic leads the interplay between coulomb interaction and spin accumulation translates into an enhancement and a suppression of the current polarization @xmath0 in ap and p cases , respectively , depending on the bias .",
