    "redshifted  21-cm absorption can provide an excellent probe of the contents and nature of the early universe , through surveys which are not subject to the same flux and magnitude limitations suffered by optical studies .",
    "in particular , observation of the epoch of re - ionisation ( e.g. @xcite ) , measurement of the contribution of the neutral gas content to the mass density of the universe ( see @xcite ) , as well as measuring any putative variations in the values of the fundamental constants at large look - back times ( @xcite ) .",
    "such absorption is , however , currently rare , with only 75  21-cm absorption systems at @xmath5 known  41 of which occur in galaxies intervening the sight - lines to more distant quasars , with the remainder arising in the hosts of radio galaxies and quasars ( summarised in @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "while the 50% detection rate in intervening absorbers can be attributed to flux coverage effects , introduced by the geometry of a flat expanding universe @xcite , the detection rate in these latter `` associated '' systems is currently attributed to unified schemes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , where only type-2 objects present a dense column of absorbing gas along our sight - line .",
    "we @xcite have however recently found that the ultra - violet luminosity of the agn is the key in determining whether 21-cm absorption is detected , with agn type having little bearing on this , contrary to the current consensus ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , uv luminosities may also be the root cause of other observed properties , seemingly responsible for the 21-cm detection rate in the hosts of radio galaxies and quasars ( @xcite and verified by @xcite ) .",
    "we hence suggest that the paucity of redshifted 21-cm absorption is due to the optical selection of targets , where at such large distances only the most uv luminous are known .",
    "we have therefore embarked on several observing campaigns , at various redshifts , of optically faint sources in order to test this hypothesis and increase the number of associated 21-cm absorbers known at @xmath6 . in this letter",
    "we present the first of these , a mini - survey using the 10001450 mhz band of the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , in which we find 21-cm absorption towards one of the two lobes resolved in pks 1649062 , a @xmath7 radio galaxy @xcite .",
    "as per our previous surveys @xcite , we selected targets from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs , @xcite ) , a source of bright and generally compact radio objects for which there exists comprehensive optical photometry @xcite . in order to ensure that the @xmath1   luminosities of our targets are below the critical @xmath8 , above which 21-cm has never been detected @xcite , we target those which are sufficiently faint at a given redshift",
    "however , applying the @xmath9 curve ( figure 5 of @xcite ) as an initial diagnostic , yields only two phfs sources with @xmath10 in the 307347 mhz band ( @xmath11 ) , both of which have been previously searched for 21-cm @xcite . of the other available bands ,",
    "there are three with @xmath12 in the 580640 mhz band ( @xmath13 ) , whereas in the 10001450 mhz band ( @xmath0 ) there are 15 sources with measured redshifts and @xmath14",
    ". should be close to ensuring @xmath15  at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "] we therefore selected the ten faintest in this band , for which we also requested time to search for oh 18-cm absorption , on the basis of their large blue  near - infrared colours ( all ten have @xmath16 , cf .",
    "@xmath17 for the five known redshifted oh absorbers , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , time was only awarded to search for 21-cm in four objects and so we selected the two reddest which had not been previously searched , pks 0036216 ( @xmath18 ) and 1128047 ( @xmath19 ) , as well as the two with the largest flux densities ( estimated to be @xmath20 jy ) , 0153410 and 1649062 .      the four shortlisted targets ( listed in table [ sum ] ) were observed with the 10001450 mhz receiver backed with the fx correlator over a bandwidth of 8 mhz split into 256 channels .",
    "this setup was chosen in order to give a channel spacing of @xmath21 , while maintaining a coverage of @xmath22 , thus covering any uncertainties in the redshifts of the targets . regarding the observations of these : +",
    "* pks 0036216 * was observed at a central frequency of 1061 mhz for a total of 0.90 hours on 26 november 2009 .",
    "the delays were self calibrated , with pks 002326 being used for the bandpass calibration .",
    "minimal radio frequency interference ( rfi ) meant that only non - functioning antennas had to be flagged , leaving 365 good baseline pairs .",
    "for this , and the other targets , the data were reduced using the miriad interferometry reduction package , from which a spectrum was extracted from the cube .",
    "the source was unresolved by the @xmath23 synthesised beam . + * pks 0153410 * was observed at a central frequency of 1159 mhz for a total 1.82 hours on 26 november 2009 .",
    "again , the delays were self calibrated , with 3c48 being used for bandpass calibration .",
    "severe rfi over the length of the observation meant that no image could be produced . + * pks 1128047 * was observed at a central frequency of 1122 mhz for a total of 0.93 hours on 25 july 2010 .",
    "the delays were calibrated using lbqs 11480007 and the bandpass using 3c286 .",
    "rfi was minimal , leaving 365 good baseline pairs .",
    "the source was unresolved by the @xmath24 synthesised beam . + * pks 1649062 * was observed at a central frequency of 1149 mhz for a total of 2.29 hours on 27 november 2009 .",
    "the delays were calibrated using pks 162111 , with bandpass calibration by 3c273 and 3c468 . although there was little sign of rfi , after calibration , using either bandpass calibrator , some of the antenna pairs ( involving mostly antenna number 15 and above ) exhibited flux densities which were so low as to be comparable with the r.m.s .",
    "noise and the inclusion of these prevented the production of any reasonable image .",
    "we therefore used a script to automatically flag all of those with a mean flux - to - noise ratio below some specified value .",
    "only once this value reached 10 was a reasonable image ( that shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra+map ] , left ) obtained and since this left us with only 60 baseline pairs , further flagging would have been detrimental to this .",
    "the flagging of the longer baselines meant that the synthesised beam was much coarser than for the other observations ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this was sufficient to resolve a double lobed radio source , in which 21-cm absorption was detected towards one of the lobes .",
    "in table [ sum ] we summarise the results of the survey , where we detected 21-cm in one of the three sources for which there are useful data ( see fig .",

    "_ arising from tidal debris left over from a major merger event_. the presence of 21-cm absorption as far as @xmath3 kpc from the nucleus may be naturally explained by the cold gas left over from a collision , a common mechanism in the formation of powerful radio galaxies @xcite .",
