    "theoretical interest in the rare decay @xmath0 as a test of the standard model has recently been renewed by the experimental results of the cleo collaboration @xcite . for the first time , this mode has been positively identified and a preliminary determination of its branching ratio given .",
    "the significance of @xmath0 arises from the underlying flavor - changing quark - level process @xmath9 , which first occurs through penguin - type diagrams at one - loop in the standard model .",
    "the process is also sensitive to new physics appearing as virtual particles in the internal loops .",
    "existing bounds on the @xmath9 branching ratio have been used to place constraints on supersymmetry @xcite and other extensions of the standard model @xcite .    in order to compare the experimental branching ratio with a theoretical prediction",
    "it is necessary to know the relevant hadronic matrix elements .",
    "these have been estimated using a wide range of methods , including relativistic and nonrelativistic quark models @xcite , two - point and three - point qcd sum rules @xcite and heavy quark symmetry @xcite , but there remains some disagreement between the different results .",
    "it is therefore of interest to perform a direct calculation of the matrix elements using lattice qcd .",
    "the viability of the lattice approach was first demonstrated by the work of bernard , hsieh and soni @xcite in 1991 .    in the leading - log approximation",
    "the @xmath0 transition is caused by a single chiral magnetic moment operator from the effective weak hamiltonian . in the notation of grinstein , springer and wise @xcite",
    "this is , @xmath10 with an on - shell matrix element given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the momentum and polarization of the emitted photon .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 arises from the mixing of @xmath15 with other effective operators in running the scale down from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the anomalous dimension matrix of all the effective operators at the one - loop level has been calculated by several groups and is now well - understood @xcite .",
    "following bernard _",
    "the general matrix element can be parametrized in terms of the momentum , @xmath18 , and polarization , @xmath19 , of the @xmath20 , and the momentum , @xmath21 , of the @xmath22 meson , using three form factors , @xmath5 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath5 is chosen to be real , so that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are purely imaginary , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 the on - shell @xmath28 matrix element depends on @xmath5 only , since @xmath29 and the coefficient of @xmath24 is zero . performing the necessary phase space integral and sums over polarization vectors gives the decay width for @xmath0 , @xmath30 by computing the matrix elements on the lattice for various @xmath31 , the on - shell value of the form factor @xmath32 can be obtained by interpolation .",
    "we work in the quenched approximation on a @xmath33 lattice at @xmath2 , which corresponds to an inverse lattice spacing @xmath34 , evaluated by measuring the string tension @xcite .",
    "our calculation is performed on sixty @xmath35 gauge field configurations ( for details see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the quark propagators are calculated using an @xmath3-improved wilson fermion action @xcite .",
    "we use gauge  invariant smeared sources for the heavy quark propagators with an r.m.s . smearing radius of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "local sources are used for the light quark propagators .    as the mass of the @xmath37 quark is almost twice the inverse lattice spacing , direct computation of a @xmath37-quark propagator is not feasible .",
    "we therefore compute heavy - quark propagators with masses in the region of the charm - quark mass , and extrapolate .",
    "our statistical errors are calculated according to the bootstrap procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , using 250 bootstrap samples .    to obtain the matrix element @xmath38",
    ", we calculate a ratio of three - point and two - point correlators , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 interpolating fields for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons respectively .",
    "@xmath45 is the @xmath3-improved version of the operator @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the full matrix elements can then be derived by using the relation @xmath47 .",
    "we employ time reversal symmetry to obtain the correctly ordered matrix element , @xmath48 . to evaluate these correlators , we use the standard source method @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath49 and symmetrize the correlators about that point using euclidean time reversal @xcite .",
    "we evaluate @xmath50 for three values of the light quark mass ( @xmath51 ) , two values of the strange quark mass ( @xmath52 ) which straddle the physical value ( given by @xmath53 @xcite ) , and two values of the heavy quark mass ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we employ two values of the @xmath22 meson momentum ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) , and seventeen values of the momentum , @xmath57 , injected at the operator , with magnitudes between 0 and @xmath58 .",
    "to improve statistics we average over all equivalent momenta , and utilise the discrete symmetries @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where possible .",
    "provided the three points in the correlators of eq .",
    "(  [ eq:3pt - correlator ] ) are sufficiently separated in time , the ground state contribution to the ratio dominates : @xmath61 and @xmath50 approaches a plateau .",
    "the factors @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the energies of the pseudoscalar and vector particles are obtained from fits to two - point euclidean correlators .",
    "the form factor @xmath5 can be conveniently extracted from the matrix elements by considering different components of the relation , @xmath64 we see a plateau in @xmath5 about @xmath65 , and fit @xmath66 to a constant for @xmath67 , where correlations are maintained between all of the time slices .",
    "the use of smeared operators for the heavy quarks provides a very clean signal , with stable plateaus forming before timeslice 11 .",
    "data with initial or final momenta greater than @xmath68 are excluded , because they have larger statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the data for the heaviest of our light quarks , @xmath69 , with the smallest statistical errors , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1-vs - time ] .",
    "we fit @xmath70 to a linear model in order to obtain the on - shell form factor @xmath71 , @xmath72 allowing for correlations between the energies of the vector and pseudoscalar particles and @xmath5 at each @xmath31 . for our range of masses and momenta the differences between linear and pole model fits are small .",
    "the data and fit for @xmath69 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1-vs - q2 ] .",
    "the light quark mass is set to zero by a correlated chiral extrapolation to @xmath73 we assume that the on - shell @xmath5 varies with the light kappa values , @xmath74 , according to a linear model , @xmath75 the strange quark mass is set to its physical value by interpolation @xmath76 .    finally we perform an extrapolation from the two pseudoscalar masses up to @xmath77 using a model motivated by heavy quark effective theory , @xmath78    after performing this extrapolation , we obtain @xmath79 , where the quoted error is purely statistical . the finite renormalization needed for the lattice ",
    "continuum matching of the @xmath80 operator has been calculated @xcite but has a negligible effect here ( @xmath81 ) and is not included .",
    "we note that the slopes of the form factor @xmath5 with respect to @xmath74 in the chiral extrapolations are consistent with zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t1-chiral - extrapolation ] ) , which indicates that @xmath82 is almost independent of @xmath74 . however , this behaviour occurs only for the spectator quark , and is not seen to the same extent for the interacting strange quark .",
    "we explore this by fitting @xmath5 to a constant for the three values of @xmath74 .",
    "we find that the @xmath83 per degree of freedom is comparable to the original linear model , indicating that the model is statistically valid .",
    "using this approach , the final statistical error is significantly reduced , and we obtain @xmath84 . the results for @xmath5 , using both analysis procedures , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1-at - mb ] .",
    "in this letter we have reported on an _ ab initio _ computation of the form factor for the decay @xmath8 .",
    "the large number of gauge configurations used in this calculation enables an extrapolation to the appropriate masses to be made and gives a statistically meaningful result . to compare this result with experiment",
    "we convert the preliminary branching ratio from cleo , @xmath85 based on 13 events , into its corresponding @xmath5 form factor , assuming the standard model .",
    "we work at the scale @xmath86 and use values from the particle data book @xcite combined with eq .",
    "(  [ eq : decay - rate ] ) . setting the mass of the top quark to be @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 we find @xmath90 to be @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively . the two lattice results are consistent with these experimental numbers within statistical errors .",
    "this is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1-at - mb ] .    although systematic errors of this calculation resulting from the quenched approximation , finite volume and other lattice artefacts remain to be explored , we believe that we have shown the phenomenological utility of the lattice for probing the limits of the standard model .    0.5 cm * acknowledgments : * the authors wish to thank a.  soni , c.  bernard , a.  el - khadra and members of the ukqcd collaboration , including c.  allton for useful discussions on this topic .",
