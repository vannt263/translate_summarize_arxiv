    "an important problem of nowadays high energy physics is searching for deviations from the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles . at energies of the present day accelerators , the deviations may appear due to virtual states of new heavy particles entering the extended models and having the masses @xmath1 much greater than the @xmath2-boson mass : @xmath3 .",
    "one of approaches to describe contributions of these heavy states is construction of the effective lagrangians ( el ) @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the el result from the decoupling of contributions from virtual states of heavy particles to the amplitudes of scattering processes featuring sm particles .",
    "below , we employ a traditional definition of the el as the sum of scattering amplitudes of sm particles at external momenta @xmath4 . in the case of this definition ,",
    "the contributions of virtual heavy particles to the amplitudes decouple in the form of local operators involving sm fields , their derivatives , and masses .",
    "these operators , @xmath5 , by construction respect gauge symmetries of the sm , have the dimension @xmath6 , and are suppressed by the appropriate powers of heavy masses : @xmath7 the dimensionless parameters @xmath8 characterize physics beyond the sm .",
    "they are model - dependent and expressed in terms of dimensionless coupling constants .    in this way , one can write down the el of type ( [ intr:1 ] ) for any model supposed as the basis low - energy theory .",
    "for instance , the minimal super - symmetric sm can be considered . in this case",
    "the content of operators @xmath5 must be substituted @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we choose the minimal sm as the basis low - energy theory .",
    "all the types of operators @xmath5 that may arise in specific renormalizable gauge theories , containing the sm as a subgroup , are investigated in refs .",
    "then , the el is constructed as the sum of the type ( [ intr:1 ] ) with the coefficients @xmath8 treated as independent parameters to be determined from experimental data .",
    "this meaning of @xmath8 is peculiar to the approaches used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in contrast , the parameters @xmath8 entering eq . ( [ intr:1 ] ) and defined via the scattering amplitudes are not independent in general .",
    "for such a definition , a set of relations between @xmath8 has been derived and called the renormalization group ( rg ) relations @xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of the rg equations for @xmath9-matrix elements and the decoupling theorem @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we extend the analysis to the case of searching for heavy @xmath0 boson in four - fermionic processes .",
    "we suppose that the effective ( or basis ) low - energy theory ( the minimal sm in our case ) is specified .",
    "that means we choose the appropriate set of operators @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ intr:1 ] ) .",
    "we discriminate between the abelian and the non - abelian @xmath0 bosons , assuming the different types of their interactions with light particles .",
    "the low - energy model is the remnant of some unknown high - energy theory predicting the abelian @xmath0 boson .",
    "the constraints on the @xmath0 parameters can be derived with or without knowledge of the underlying theory . in this regard",
    ", we will call them the model dependent and the model independent ones @xcite .",
    "the rg relations being the consequence of renormalizability are the model independent constraints .",
    "let us summarize the main steps in deriving the rg relations @xcite .",
    "first , as the decoupling theorem guarantees , the operators originating from interactions of the renormalizable types have to be preserved in the el in leading order in @xmath10 .",
    "since the underlying theory is not specified , the corresponding @xmath8 must be considered as arbitrary parameters .",
    "hence , one is able at least to relate different parameters describing different scattering processes .",
    "second , a heavy virtual state can be treated as an external field scattering sm light particles .",
    "the transition amplitude is splitted in two scattering vertices with arbitrary vertex coefficients .",
    "the renormalizability of the theory can be used in a way to incorporate information about the @xmath11 and @xmath12 functions entering the rg operator at low energies in the framework of the external field problem .",
    "the key point of the renormalizability of the vertices exploited is that the algebraic structure of the divergent part of a scattering amplitude calculated in higher orders of perturbation theory coincides with that of the tree - level vertex .",
    "hence , the relation between the vertex coefficient and the @xmath11 and @xmath12 functions follows .",
    "if the underlying theory is specified , the relation is just an identity .",
    "but if the theory is not assumed and the number of @xmath11 and @xmath12 functions is less than the number of rg relations , a non - trivial system of algebraic equations for vertex coefficients and , hence , for parameters @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ intr:1 ] ) can be obtained .    although the underlying theory predicting the abelian @xmath0 boson is not specified , it is possible to parameterize the @xmath0 interactions with the sm particles assuming the effective gauge group to be @xmath13 as it is often discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "this parameterization is natural , in regard of the decoupling theorem , when the leading order operators @xmath14 are investigated . in general",
    ", there are not reasons to assume a priori that the complete lagrangian of the model is the @xmath15 invariant .",
    "however , for our approach the low - energy parameterization is important . as it will be seen , the derived rg relations distinguish the abelian @xmath0 and the most general parameterizations of the @xmath0 interactions with the sm fields .",
    "moreover , in the latter case the subgroup of @xmath0 gauge group is fixed ( due to the renormalizability ) .    in what follows , we will formulate the low - energy rg relations for four - fermion amplitudes in order @xmath14 .",
    "as it will be shown , the relations hold only in the case if the absolute value of the @xmath0 coupling to the axial - vector currents is the same for all the sm fermions .",
    "hence , some of the parameters @xmath8 are not independent . moreover ,",
    "being a consequence of the renormalizability , the rg relations ensure that the yukawa terms of the sm lagrangian respect the @xmath15 gauge symmetry associated with the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the content is as follows . in sec .",

    "the model under consideration is assumed to be the low energy remnant of some unknown underlying theory .",
    "it involves the sm and the additional abelian vector boson @xmath0 which is supposed to be a massive particle with the mass @xmath16 much heavier than the @xmath2-boson mass . in the present paper the mechanism of heavy mass generation",
    "is not considered since the underlying theory describing interactions at energies @xmath17 is unspecified .",
    "so , the lagrangian includes the explicit mass term for the @xmath0 boson , and the mass @xmath16 is treated as a parameter of the model .",
    "the most general parameterization of the interactions between the abelian @xmath0 and the sm fields can be performed on the base of the effective gauge group @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "then , the corresponding lagrangian is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sm scalar doublet , and the summation over all the sm left - handed doublets @xmath20 and the sm right - handed singlets @xmath21 is understood",
    ". the charges @xmath22 and the fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 correspond to the gauge groups @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath15 , respectively , @xmath28 is the fermion charge in the positron charge units , @xmath29 are the pauli matrices , @xmath30 is a @xmath31 unity matrix , and @xmath32 for leptons and @xmath33 for quarks .",
    "the values of the dimensionless constants @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 depend on the particular higher - energy theory including @xmath0 boson . here , they are to be considered as arbitrary parameters .",
    "this parameterization , for instance , accounts for the most general @xmath0 interactions generated in string theories @xcite .",
    "up to this point the electroweak symmetry @xmath37 was supposed to be unbroken , and all the sm particles were massless .",
    "the masses of the sm particles are generated by the spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry @xmath38 originated due to the non - zero vacuum expectation value of the scalar doublet .",
    "however , the mass eigenstates are appeared to be shifted away from the original fields @xmath39 , since the corresponding mass terms become non - diagonal .",
    "the physical fields @xmath40 are obtained by the orthogonal transformation : @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the sm value of the weinberg angle ( @xmath44 ) , and @xmath45 denotes the mixing angle relating physical states @xmath46 , @xmath47 to massive neutral components of the @xmath13 gauge fields . the value of the angle @xmath45 can be determined from the relation @xmath48 confirming ref.@xcite .",
    "the masses of the physical fields are given by the expressions : @xmath49    as is seen , the mass of the physical @xmath50-boson differs from the sm value @xmath51 by the small quantity of order @xmath52 .",
    "so , the mixing angle @xmath45 is also small @xmath53 .",
    "the difference @xmath54 is negative and completely determined by the @xmath0 coupling to the scalar doublet .",
    "thus , constraints on the @xmath0 interaction with scalar fields can be derived by means of experimental detecting this observable : @xmath55    using eqs .",

    "the effective four - fermion vertex is generated due to the heavy mass in the @xmath0-boson propagator : @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "so , expressions involving such amplitudes can be computed neglecting the terms proportional to @xmath56 in the lagrangian . only linear in @xmath0 terms of the lagrangian are needed , which have the following form in the t hooft - feynman gauge : @xmath60 + o\\left(\\frac{m^2_w}{\\lambda^2}\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the positron charge , @xmath64 denotes the vacuum expectation value of the scalar doublet , @xmath65 is the higgs scalar particle , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the goldstone fields .",
    "as we mentioned before , the model under consideration is supposed to be the low - energy limit of some unspecified renormalizable theory describing interactions at energies @xmath68 . as is known , due to renormalizability the @xmath9-matrix elements are invariant with respect to the rg transformations which express independence of the amplitudes of the normalization point @xmath69 . in a theory with",
    "different mass scales the rg flow and the decoupling of heavy loop contributions at the thresholds of heavy masses give possibility to determine all the parameters of scattering amplitudes .",
    "the decoupling is resulted in an important property of the low energy amplitudes : the running of the proper functions is regulated by loops of light particles .",
    "therefore , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 functions at low energies , @xmath70 , are determined by the sm particles , only .",
    "the latter fact allows to formulate a series of the rg relations for scattering amplitudes . we will derive them for the case of heavy @xmath0 boson which",
    ", as well as other heavy particles , is decoupled .",
    "we will use the notations @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the qcd charge , the coupling of the yukawa interaction between @xmath75 and @xmath19 , and the scalar self - coupling , respectively ) and @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 represents all the fields of the theory , and @xmath78 are particle masses ) to refer to the charges , the fields , and the masses .",
    "then the rg equation reads : @xmath79 where renormalized ( running ) parameters @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the solutions to the equations : @xmath82 hats over quantities mark the parameters of the underlying theory .",
    "they include the contributions of loops containing both the sm particles and the heavy ones .",
    "below , in carrying out calculations the dimensional regularization and the @xmath83 renormalization scheme @xcite will be used .",
    "the @xmath83 scheme is mass independent one , so the rg operator @xmath84 has the same form at high , @xmath68 , and low , @xmath70 , energies .    in the energy range",
    "@xmath70 all the heavy fields are decoupled .",
    "so , one can introduce the running parameters @xmath85 , @xmath86 completely defined by the low - energy effective theory @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 functions contain no contributions from loops with heavy particles .",
    "these parameters can be expressed in terms of the original ones : @xmath88 where the matching between the both sets of parameters ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath89 , @xmath81 ) is chosen to be done at the normalization point @xmath90 : @xmath91    actually , eq .",

    "the first one , @xmath170 describes the vector boson analogous to the sm field @xmath171 .",
    "such a field may appear as a component of the non - abelian gauge field .",
    "the second solution leads to the relations derived in this paper : @xmath172 they correspond to the abelian vector boson considered .",
    "thus , the proposed method to relate the parameters @xmath8 could be applied to interactions of light sm particles with other heavy particles ( leptoquarks , for example ) treated as the external fields .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a general renormalization framework for the @xmath173 theory was presented , and , in particular , the set of relevant counterterms has been derived .",
    "owing to @xmath15 symmetry the same counterterms were postulated for different @xmath0 couplings to fermions .",
    "however , as it was shown above , this fact requires the specific relations between the hypercharges @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "naturally , the relations hold automatically for a specific renormalizable higher - energy theory . however , if the hypercharges are treated as unknown parameters these relations are to be taken into account in order to respect the gauge symmetry .    in fact",
    ", the obtained relations ( [ 4.24 ] ) demonstrate that the fermion and the scalar sectors of new physics are strongly connected .",
    "the couplings of the @xmath0 boson to the sm axial - vector currents are completely determined by its interaction with the scalar fields , if a single light scalar doublet is assumed . when the @xmath0 coupling to the scalar doublet is switched off ( @xmath174 ) ,",
    "the @xmath0 boson interacts at the tree level with the sm vector currents , only ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "but even in this case the couplings to the axial currents are to be produced by loops being suppressed by the additional small factor @xmath132 .    as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ 4.24 ] ) , the rg relations respect the @xmath15 symmetry of the yukawa terms responsible for generating the masses of the sm fermions . therefore , assuming the basis low - energy theory to be , for example , the two - higgs - doublet sm , one could expect that the relations identical to eq .",
    "( [ 4.24 ] ) can be derived for the abelian @xmath0 couplings to each of the scalar doublets . however , in general , the rg relations are not determined by the specific gauge invariance of the lagrangian .",
    "for instance , consider the non - abelian @xmath0 couplings described by the solution ( [ dis:1 ] ) .",
    "as one can check , the relations ( [ dis:1 ] ) require no specific gauge invariance of the yukawa terms .    as it was mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the @xmath0 interaction with the scalar doublet is completely determined by the observable @xmath54 ( see eq .",
    "( [ model:5a ] ) ) . therefore ,",
    "one is able to predict the coupling of the @xmath0 to the sm axial - vector currents .",
    "when @xmath0 boson does not interact with the scalar doublet , the physical mass of @xmath50 boson is to be identical to its sm value .",
    "it is worth noticing that the experimental value of @xmath176 in eq .",
    "( [ model:5a ] ) must be properly chosen in order to satisfy the definition @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath0 existence has not to affect the quantity @xmath177 in order @xmath178 .",
    "so , the determination of the weinberg angle in terms of the qed coupling constant @xmath179 and the fermi constant @xmath180 measured from the muon decay is preferable , since the tree level values of these parameters @xmath181 , @xmath182 include the contributions of @xmath2 bosons and the qed sector , only .",
    "the proposed method can be applied to find the relations of the derived type for different effective four - fermion operators generated by the @xmath0 ( for instance , discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in general ,",
    "it gives possibility to search for other heavy virtual states that is the problem for future .",
