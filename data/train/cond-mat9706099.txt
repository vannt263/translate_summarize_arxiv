    "our results indicate that intrinsic two - time autocorrelation functions @xmath6 , describing the return of activity to a site at time @xmath7 which was active most recently at time @xmath8 for an avalanche that started at @xmath9 , decay as power laws with two distinct regimes according to @xmath10 the early time regime is that of the familiar stationary dynamics .",
    "the late time regime has a new critical coefficient @xmath0 characterizing the nonstationary relaxation behavior of the soc systems .",
    "the `` waiting time '' @xmath11 separating the early and late time regimes is a measure of the age of the avalanche .",
    "we have argued that this aging behavior arises from the hierarchical structure of the avalanches .",
    "generally , the origin of aging behavior does not have to be profound .",
    "for instance , it arises in a simple random walk model near a wall , where a symmetry ( translational invariance ) is explicitly broken .",
    "but while the random walk near a wall and the bak - sneppen model ( especially its random neighbor variant @xcite ) are similar in many ways , it appears that those similarities do not explain the observed aging behavior .    in sec .",
    "ii , we use the random walk near a wall to illustrate the quantities that will be measured for the soc models . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the important technical issue of extracting the intrinsic aging behavior for a process that does not conserve its norm ( such as a random walk near an absorbing wall or a soc avalanche , having a finite stopping probability ) . in sec .",
    "iv , we present detailed numerical results for the aging behavior of soc models in one and two dimensions .",
    "in particular , we have simulated the bak - sneppen model and the multi - trade model .",

    "in this section we will discuss a random walk model to provide a simple intuitive picture of aging .",

    "furthermore , the random walk illustrates the meaning of the correlation functions used to describe the aging behavior and serves to discuss some of the technical issues in measuring those functions .",
    "we want to consider a random walker on a @xmath1 lattice who can jump at most one step on each update either on the infinite lattice or a semi - infinite lattice with an absorbing wall at the origin .",
    "a random walk is completely described by its propagator , the conditional probability @xmath12 for a walker to reach a site @xmath13 at time @xmath14 , given that it was at site @xmath15 at some previous time @xmath16 . to determine its aging behavior we want to compute a simple two - time correlation function",

    "thus , to determine the return probability to a site , we take the time @xmath11 from the start of the walk to a previous passage at that site into account .",
    "if the two - time correlation function @xmath18 explicitly depends on @xmath11 , the system is said to `` age '' because the walk would retain a memory of the time since its inception in form of a return probability that evolves over time .      clearly , for an unconstraint walk , @xmath19 is invariant in space and time , and it is @xmath20 . since the norm of the walk is preserved at all times , @xmath21 , eq .",

    "( [ twotime ] ) merely simplifies to @xmath23 which remains dependent @xmath11 .",
    "hence the breaking of spatial invariance in @xmath19 leads to a breaking of time invariance in @xmath18 .",
    "such a memory effect arises in the following manner : while in the unconstrained case the mean distance @xmath24 of the walker from its origin vanishes , the walker starting near a wall departs from it such that @xmath25 , which follows from the propagator given by @xmath26 \\label{result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for sufficiently large @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",

    "the scaling function @xmath34 behaves asymptotically as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , but to obtain the `` intrinsic '' aging behavior of this process , we have to consider the effect that the norm is not preserved because at each time step walkers may disappear at the absorbing wall .",

    "( [ twotime ] ) @xmath42 we would have to conclude that this process ages , since @xmath18 depends on @xmath11 . and , indeed , in a numerical simulation of the process we would measure @xmath43 , because we would average over all processes up to a temporal cut - off @xmath44 , including those that disappear at times @xmath45 .",
    "but , clearly , the `` aging '' in this simple process is an artifact due to the diminished norm @xmath46 at time @xmath31 .",
    "thus , proper normalization is required to extract the `` intrinsic '' aging behavior ( due to the infinite walk ) from the `` measured '' aging behavior@xcite .",
    "other process , such as random walks near an absorbing wall or avalanches in the bak - sneppen mechanism below , also may disappear before reaching the cut - off , and we have to consider the effect on the statistics of the measured results . here ,",
    "too , one is interested in the intrinsic properties of the surviving process , i. e. those of the infinite random walk or avalanche , while in simulations one usually averages over all runs of a process , whether they survived or not . in many cases , the results for the asymptotic scaling behavior of some intrinsic property are no different than the measured ones because the contribution from dying runs remains insignificant .",
    "but for the correlation functions considered in this paper which depend on two independent time variables , we do need to consider the effect of the probability @xmath47 of a process to disappear at time @xmath48 to relate the intrinsic and the measure results .    to obtain the _ intrinsic _ properties of the infinite process",
    ", we have to properly normalize the correlation function . to that end , we consider the two - time correlation function @xmath49 for a run that disappears exactly at time @xmath50 , and its generic relation to the intrinsic two - time correlation function @xmath51 : @xmath52 these quantities are related to the measured two - time correlation function @xmath53 given in eq .",

    "thus , even after correcting for the effect of disappearing walkers , the intrinsic process still shows aging behavior : the measurable aging effect derived in eq .",
    "( [ cabso ] ) , @xmath63 , leads to an intrinsic aging behavior of @xmath64 with @xmath65 according to eq .",
    "( [ imrel ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the infinite walk may never touch the absorbing potential on the wall but clearly feels its effect .",
    "the bak - sneppen model @xcite has been studied intensely and with great numerical accuracy in recent years .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of its many features and simply utilize those facts here .",

    "the smallest random number @xmath69 is located .",
    "that site as well as its @xmath70 nearest neighbors each get new random numbers drawn independently from a flat distribution between zero and one .",
    "the system evolves to a soc state where almost all numbers have values above @xmath71 , with @xmath71 avalanches formed by the remaining numbers below .",
    "the multi - trade model @xcite is a variant of the bak - sneppen model that provides a series of exact results for the spatio - temporal correlations in the avalanche process .",
    "especially , an equation of motion can be derived and solved to obtain a propagator for the spread of avalanche activity , and to obtain a complete set of scaling exponents that verify scaling relations previously proposed for the bak - sneppen model . in this model",
    "each lattice site is occupied by @xmath72 independent random numbers . on each update",
    "again the smallest number in the whole system is located and updated , and one randomly chosen number ( out of @xmath72 ) from each of the neighboring sites is updated as well .",
    "while the mechanism proceeds in the same way for all @xmath72 as for @xmath73 ( the bak - sneppen model ) , it can be treated analytically for @xmath74 .    a quantity similar to the two - time autocorrelation function defined in eq .",
    "( [ twotime ] ) can be measured for avalanches in the self - organized critical state of both models .",
    "we focus on a simple quantity , @xmath75 , measuring the first returns of the activity to a given site .",
    "a power law distribution for @xmath76 has been measured numerically for a variety of different soc models @xcite by recording all first returns and has been derived exactly for the multi - trade model @xcite .",
    "here we determine the intrinsic probability @xmath77 to return after @xmath14 time steps to a site that was visited most recently at time @xmath11 from the beginning of the avalanche .",
    "thus , to obtain the first - return probability , we take the age of the avalanche , @xmath11 , into account . while in the stationary state of soc models",

    "the bak - sneppen mechanism in both models evolves on an isotropic lattice with update rules that do not change with time .",
    "the question then arises whether the exponent @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ pfirst ] ) can be related to the known universal coefficients of the stationary soc process , or whether it describes new physics in avalanche dynamics of the bak - sneppen model .      in our simulations for both models",
