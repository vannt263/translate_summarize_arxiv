    "ferromagnetic kondo model_. in both models the spin of a magnetic impurity is coupled to the spins of the conduction electrons of a non - magnetic host lattice . in the ( antiferromagnetic )",
    "kondo model the sign of the coupling constant is such that antiparallel coupling between the impurity and the conduction - electron spins is favoured ( antiferromagnetic intraatomic exchange ) . in the ferromagnetic kondo model , with the opposite sign of the coupling constant , parallel coupling is favoured ( ferromagnetic intraatomic exchange ) .",
    "the ( antiferromagnetic ) kondo model has been one of the most intensively discussed many - body models in solid state physics since kondo in 1964 succeeded in explaining the resistance minimum of metals with small amounts of transition element impurities @xcite .",
    "thorough theoretical investigations later on led to the discovery of the cause of the minimum , the kondo effect , which is the collective ( many - body ) screening of the impurity spin by the spins of the conduction electrons below the kondo temperature @xmath0 @xcite . by means of wilson s numerical renormalization group theory ( nrg ) @xcite and bethe - ansatz methods @xcite exact solutions for thermodynamic properties such as the magnetic susceptibility and the heat capacity were obtained . later",
    "the nrg was successfully extended to the computation of dynamic ( energy - dependent ) quantities @xcite .",
    "although the antiferromagnetic kondo model can thus be regarded as in principle solved , its local density of states ( ldos ) with the full energy dependence has not been calculated so far @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the ldos is an interesting quantity , particularly since scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) has made it experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "the ldos of the ferromagnetic kondo model , too , has not been calculated yet .",
    "the ferromagnetic kondo model has generally received less attention than its antiferromagnetic counterpart .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that a spectacular `` ferromagnetic kondo effect '' does not exist because the effective coupling does not scale to infinity as in the antiferromagnetic kondo model @xcite .",
    "a second reason might be that there are fewer experimental realizations than in the antiferromagnetic case .    in this paper we present results for the @xmath1-ldos of both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic kondo models for the full range of band occupations and coupling strengths , gained by means of a simple green s function approximation scheme based on nagaoka s decoupling procedure @xcite .",
    "the equations of nagaoka s decoupling scheme were solved analytically by zittartz and mller - hartmann @xcite .",
    "however , their equations still depend self - consistently on the scattering matrix . therefore , in order to find self - consistent numerical solutions , it is equally well justified to use nagaoka s original equations .    qualitatively results prove trustworthy despite the crudness of the approximations . for weak couplings",
    "the main correlation feature in the impurity - site ldos of the antiferromagnetic kondo model is an antiresonance , which is slightly shifted with respect to the fermi level .",
    "there is an analogous antiresonance in the ldos of the single - impurity anderson model .",
    "a related antiresonance structure was observed in recent sts measurements on magnetic impurity adatoms @xcite . for strong couplings the dominant characteristic",
    "are quasiparticle @xmath2-peaks .",
    "these can be traced back to the limiting case of an empty conduction band , for which exact results and rigorous interpretation are given , and the atomic limit @xcite .    in the ferromagnetic kondo model the ldos at the fermi level",
    "is practically independent on the coupling strength , which is consistent with the fact of a vanishing phase shift .",
    "however , the ldos is diminished in the vicinity , giving rise to a peak - like structure . if representing a true feature",
    ", this peak structure should be measurable in sts experiments on magnetic adatoms with _",
    "ferromagnetic _ intraatomic exchange .",
    "it is clear that the approximation scheme is too simple to yield quantitatively reliable results .",
    "subtle features like the exponential kondo scale in the antiferromagnetic kondo model can not be reproduced .",
    "much better methods like numerical renormalization group theory ( nrg ) or quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite would be required for that .",

    "the greater weight of the upper peak ( `` triplet peak '' ) results from the degeneracy of the triplet states .",
    "the degree of localization of the bound states around the impurity site is very large as can be seen when comparing the spectral weights of the singlet and triplet peaks at the impurity and neighbouring sites ( fig .",

    "for instance , the bound singlet state corresponds to a bound state in a potential well , which has an exponentially decreasing overlap into the adjacent region if the depth of the well is finite . in case of an infinitely deep well , corresponding to the strong - coupling limit , each bound state",

[",

    "for weak to intermediate couplings ( @xmath78 ) and not too small band occupations ( @xmath79 ) the most prominent feature in the ldos is an antiresonance at the fermi level , which will be discussed in subsection 1 . in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath80 )",
    "quasiparticle @xmath2-peaks are the dominant characteristic , which are discussed in subsection 2 .          for small couplings ( @xmath81 )",

    "is practically zero .",
    "however , no antiresonance in the narrower sense is left , instead the ldos is dominated by quasiparticle peaks . in the following paragraphs we will discuss independent evidence for an antiresonance in the ( antiferromagnetic ) kondo model .",
    "after that , the antiresonance will be related to a structure recently observed in sts experiments .    in ref .",
    "mezei and zawadowski considered the kondo model for different types of scattering .",
    "they made explicit statements on the ldos for the resonance energy , for which they could refer to a definite value of the phase shift .",
    "for @xmath85-type scattering they found complete suppression of the ldos , while non-@xmath85-type scattering was shown to involve no changes at the resonance energy .",
    "as each of the scattering types ( @xmath86 etc . ) is connected with a special wave - vector dependence in the coupling constant , it seems a priori unclear how to apply those results to the kondo model with a wave - vector independent coupling - constant @xmath16 discussed in this paper .",
    "evidence for an antiresonance in the ldos of the kondo model is provided by a comparison with results for the ( single - impurity ) anderson model @xcite .",
    "as is well - known , the anderson model in the so - called kondo limit can be mapped on the kondo model by the unitary schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite .",
    "a correspondence must be expected between results in the kondo limit of the anderson model and the weak - coupling limit of the kondo model . in the anderson model",
    "one does observe an antiresonance in the conduction - electron ldos .",
    "it is closely related to the appearance of the well - known kondo resonance ( peak ) in the impurity quasiparticle density of states ( impurity qdos ) .",
    "sollie and schlottmann calculated the conduction - electron ldos and the impurity qdos of the single - impurity anderson model within the slave - boson approach @xcite .",
    "the conduction - electron ldos shows the antiresonance appearing at the same energy and with the same width as the kondo resonance in the impurity qdos , which reveals the intimate relation between both structures .",
    "both appear not exactly at the fermi energy but slightly above , similar to what we observe for the antiresonance in the kondo model .",
    "more recently schiller and hershfield emphasized the direct correspondence between antiresonance and kondo resonance ( `` abrikosov - suhl resonance '' ) in the anderson model @xcite .    ) .",
    "the fermi level is indicated by the thin dotted line .",
    "the shift of the antiresonance relative to the fermi level is of the order of @xmath87 in units of the bandwidth .",
    "( same calculation as in @xmath88 . ) ]    we have performed a calculation for the anderson model within the modified perturbation theory ( mpt ) .",
    "the mpt is an extension of the conventional second - order perturbational scheme @xcite to improve the strong - coupling behaviour away from the symmetric point , which is the only point at which the conventional perturbation theory also converges for large hubbard interaction @xmath89.@xcite for details we refer to ref .  , where the mpt was successfully applied to the single - impurity anderson model .",
    "it has also been used in the context of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) to examine the hubbard model @xcite and the periodic anderson model @xcite .",
    "our results for the single - impurity anderson model for three different band occupations @xmath75 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : siam_mpt ] .",
    "the kondo resonance in the impurity qdos and the antiresonance in the conduction - electron ldos are clearly to be seen at the fermi level ( for @xmath90 slightly above ) .     calculated with the modified perturbation theory ( mpt ) .",

    "parameters : @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( bloch dispersion as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rn0jn ] ) . ]    with the parameters chosen , an approximate correspondence to the kondo model with @xmath93 is to be expected according to the schrieffer - wolff transformation .",
    "for each of the three band occupations the anderson - model ldos is indeed quite similar to the kondo - model ldos for @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rn0jn ] .",
    "the only basic difference is for the symmetric anderson - model ldos , where the antiresonance goes right down to zero , whereas in the @xmath95 kondo - model ldos it does not . for the symmetric anderson model one can show , using the fact that the electrons form a fermi liquid , that the conduction - electron ldos of the impurity site must be zero at the fermi energy . assuming this is conserved in the schrieffer - wolff transformation , it is apparently a shortcoming of our approximation scheme that for small to intermediate couplings the symmetric kondo - model ldos is not fully suppressed at the fermi energy",
    "furthermore , one can not expect our approximation scheme to satisfy the subtle exponential dependence of the width of the antiresonance on the coupling constant @xmath16 via the kondo temperature @xmath0 @xcite , which should occur in analogy to the anderson model .",
    "nevertheless , the antiresonances coming out from the calculations clearly indicate the correct antiresonance of the kondo model .",
    "since the antiresonance of the kondo model is closely connected with the one in the anderson model and because of the intimate relation of the latter to the well - known kondo resonance , we use for both antiresonance structures the term `` kondo antiresonance '' .",
    "recently experimental evidence was found for the kondo antiresonance in the conduction - electron ldos of magnetic impurity adatoms on metal surfaces . in scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments the differential conductance @xmath96 was measured for the cases of ce adatoms on a ag(111 ) surface @xcite , for co on au(111 ) @xcite and for co on cu(111 ) @xcite . in each experiment",
    "a narrow antiresonance structure with a slight upward shift relative to the fermi level was observed in the @xmath96 spectrum .",

    ", in case of weak tunneling , low enough temperatures ( @xmath97 ) and in an energy range in which the ldos of the stm tip is nearly constant , the differential conductance @xmath96 is in general proportional to what we shall call a `` mixed ldos '' .",
    "contributions to this `` mixed ldos '' come from all electronic states ( `` tunneling channels '' ) of the substrate that are involved in the tunneling process .",
    "the `` mixed ldos '' is not just the sum over partial densities of states but also contains quantum - interference effects between the different tunneling channels .    as for their measurements on ce / ag(111 ) , li et al",
    ".  assumed that they were `` locally sensitive to the hybridized @xmath98 conduction band '' @xcite .",
    "this is supported by schiller and hershfield @xcite , who achieved optimal theoretical agreement with the measured antiresonance curve on the assumption that alternative tunneling into the impurity ( ce ) @xmath99-orbital was zero .",
    "accordingly , the pure conduction - electron ldos was probed , which allows to directly identify the antiresonance in the @xmath96 spectrum with the kondo antiresonance in the conduction - electron ldos .",
    "by contrast , in the case of co / au(111 ) the involvement of the tunneling channels and the interpretation of the @xmath96 spectrum are a matter of controversy .",
    "madhavan et al .  assumed significant contributions from tunneling both into the conduction band and the impurity @xmath100-orbital of the co adatom , attributing an asymmetry of the antiresonance to quantum - interference effects between the @xmath100-orbital and the conduction electron channels @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by an excellent theoretical fit of the antiresonance .",
    "however , jsghy et al .  assumed tunneling into the conduction band only and achieved an equally good theoretical fit @xcite .",
    "the ambiguity is already inherent in fano s theory @xcite , which in refs .   and was generalized to the interacting case . for non - interacting electrons",
    "one can show that the asymmetric shape of a `` fano resonance '' depends , first , on the ratio of tunneling into the impurity orbital and tunneling into the conduction band , and secondly , on the symmetry / asymmetry of the free conduction - electron bdos and the fermi - level position .",
    "each of these factors and combinations of the two can lead to the same line shape .",
    "this seems to hold in the present ( interacting ) case , too .",
    "we conclude that in the case of co / au(111 ) the @xmath96 spectrum possibly represents a direct measure of the conduction - electron ldos .",
    "if so , the asymmetric antiresonance ( fano resonance ) directly represents a kondo antiresonance .",
    "if not , a kondo antiresonance may still be considered as the main underlying structure apart from impurity - orbital contributions and quantum - interference effects .          in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath101 ) the ldos of the kondo model",

    "the shift of the peak structure relative to the fermi level is of the order of @xmath87 in units of the bandwidth .",

    "@xmath110 ) .",
    "again , the generic situation in the strong - coupling regime is the presence of two quasiparticle @xmath2-peaks . in case of half filling they",
    "are located symmetrically below and above the quasiparticle band , whose weight gradually vanishes when increasing the coupling strength .",
    "similar to the antiferromagnetic kondo model and the limiting case of an empty conduction band , the ldos in the strong - coupling regime should approach the ldos of the atomic limit .",
    "the two symmetric quasiparticle @xmath2-peaks therefore correspond to the two triplet peaks in the atomic limit @xcite of the ferromagnetic kondo model for @xmath95 .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of finite hopping , admixtures of singlet character are to be expected , which only disappear in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "the assumption of singlet admixtures is supported by the observation that for @xmath111 the upper peak in the @xmath112-ldos continuously evolves from the pure singlet peak of the @xmath113-ldos ( limiting case of an empty conduction band ) when changing the band occupation from 0 to 1 .      , in dependence on the fermi level @xmath103 for different values of the coupling constant @xmath16 .",

    "[ fig : dn0n_n ] the effect of the magnetic impurity on the occupation number @xmath117 at the impurity site is demonstrated .",
    "depending on the band occupation @xmath75 , the impurity can effectively attract or repel the conduction electrons both in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic kondo models .",
    "for a symmetric bdos the dependence on the band occupation is exactly symmetric : below half filling the impurity effectively attracts the conduction electrons , @xmath118 for @xmath119 , above half filling it repels them , @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "the physical reason for this behaviour is clear and should analogously hold for a non - symmetric bdos .",
    "one of the possible couplings of an electron to the impurity spin ( in the antiferromagnetic kondo model the singlet , in the ferromagnetic kondo model the triplet ) decreases the energy of the system , making it favourable for the electron to stay at the impurity site .",
    "thus , @xmath117 is increased compared to the band occupation @xmath75 in the case of less than half filling . however , it is unfavourable for a second electron to be at the impurity site ( since it would break the favourable coupling of the other electron ) , which leads to an occupation number less than the band occupation in the case of more than half filling . in a generalized form",
    "this argument implies a critical band occupation above which the occupation number at the impurity site is less than in the rest of the lattice , corresponding to a repulsive effect of the impurity on the conduction electrons .",
    "below we discuss results of refs .   and which are seemingly contradictory to this .     for successive lattice sites in the [ 100 ] direction at a band occupation of @xmath122 for different coupling constants @xmath16 .",

    "[ fig : n0r000jn ] . ) ]    the effect of the magnetic impurity on the occupation numbers @xmath123 at the surrounding lattice sites is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : oszill ] . oscillations around the value of the band occupation which decrease in amplitude with growing distance from the impurity are to be seen .",
    "the oscillations in the occupation number reflect the friedel oscillations in the charge density , which are the typical reaction of an electron system to an impurity potential .",
    "everts and ganguly derived an expression for the charge density in the kondo model ( ref .  ) .",
    "okevi , zlati and horvati calculated charge - density oscillations in the anderson model ( ref .  ) .",
    "a quantitative comparison between charge - density and occupation - number results is only partly possible .",
    "the occupation number is the number of electrons in the wannier states at a given lattice site , whereas the charge density corresponds to the number of electrons per unit volume for a given point of space .",
    "in contrast to the occupation number , the charge density at and near a site depends also on electrons in wannier states of other sites because in real space wannier wave - functions are not confined to `` their '' sites .",
    "although there is no rigorous proportionality between occupation number and charge density , one should , nevertheless , expect correlations between the two as far as general features such as oscillations or pronounced enhancements / reductions are concerned .    in view of such general correlations",
    "it may seem unclear why in in the cited references the charge density at the impurity is _ always enhanced _",
    "( even divergent ) independent of the band occupation or @xmath124 , @xmath125 etc .",
    "it seemingly contradicts our above argument .",
    "however , the result of permanent enhancement of the charge density at the impurity site is non - generic and a consequence of integrations without cut - off .",
    "integrations were performed over plane waves up to arbitrarily large wave vectors .",
    "thus an infinite number of bands is implied with each one - electron state coupled to the impurity spin with practically the same coupling strength .",
    "there is no critical band occupation in this effective infinite - band model because an arbitrarily large number of electrons can stay at the impurity being coupled to its spin in a favourable way .",
    "we have provided results for the local density of states ( ldos ) in the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic kondo models , which has not been calculated before with its full energy dependence .",
    "although calculations were performed within a simple approximation scheme , results prove at least in qualitative terms trustworthy , allowing consistent interpretation and qualitative comparison with the experiment .",
    "there are clear quantitative limitations as indicated for example by the insufficient depth of the kondo antiresonance .",
    "nevertheless , we would expect confirmation of the general features by quantitatively reliable methods like nrg or qmc .    in summary , for small to intermediate couplings",
    "there is an antiresonance in the ldos of the antiferromagnetic kondo model ( kondo antiresonance ) , which has an analogue in the conduction - electron ldos of the anderson model .",
    "the kondo antiresonance can be identified with antiresonance structures observed in sts spectra of single magnetic adatoms on the assumption that tunneling occured mainly into the conduction band . in the ferromagnetic kondo model",
    "a peak structure appears close to the fermi level .",
    "it should be observable in appropriate sts experiments on adatoms with ferromagnetic intraatomic exchange ( possibly gd adatoms ) .",
    "for strong couplings the ldos in both models is dominated by quasiparticle @xmath2-peaks , which can be clearly related to the quasiparticle peaks of the exactly solvable case of an empty conduction band and the atomic limit . finally , we have given arguments for the impurity s attractive or repulsive effect on conduction electrons at the impurity site dependent on the band occupation and for seemingly contradictory results gained by integrating without band cut - off .",
