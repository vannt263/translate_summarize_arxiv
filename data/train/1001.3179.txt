    "the idea of the axion was introduced in 1977 by peccei and quinn@xcite as a means to solve what is known as the ` strong cp problem ' in the physics of strong interactions .",
    "the strong cp problem , the details of which are quite subtle , has to do with the vacuum structure of quantum chromodynamics . in simple physical terms",
    "it can be stated as a question : why is the electric dipole moment of the neutron ( currently unobserved ) so small ?",
    "the standard model predicts a value for the neutron dipole moment @xmath6 e cm , with @xmath1 of order unity , that should be readily measurable .",
    "peccei - quinn s solution promotes @xmath1 to a dynamical field describing a new elementary particle , the axion , whose vacuum expectation value has relaxed to a very small value , explaining the smallness of @xmath7 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath1 , and the validity of the peccei - quinn solution and its variants@xcite remain open questions of considerable importance to fundamental physics .",
    "the axion is also believed to be a viable candidate for the elusive dark matter that comprises the majority of matter in our universe @xcite and is subject to active experimental searches.@xcite    in a remarkable development axion electrodynamics has recently emerged as a key tool in the description of crystalline solids called strong topological insulators ( stis ) .",
    "these three - dimensional time - reversal invariant ( tri ) materials possess anomalous band structures characterized by a z@xmath8-valued topological invariant.@xcite this invariant , called @xmath9 , counts the number of topologically protected gapless surface states ( modulo 2 ) .",
    "a non - zero invariant means that the surface of such an insulator will be metallic .",
    "this behavior has been predicted to occur @xcite and subsequently experimentally discovered @xcite in several 3-dimensional solids such as bi@xmath10sb@xmath11 alloys and bi@xmath8se@xmath12 , bi@xmath8te@xmath12 crystals .",
    "more recently it has been realized,@xcite remarkably , that the electromagnetic response of a sti is characterized by the axion term @xmath13 with @xmath5 , the only non - zero value permitted by the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "when the time - reversal symmetry is broken , e.g.  in a crystal showing weak magnetism , @xmath1 can acquire an arbitrary value .",
    "fluctuations in the magnetic order parameter then act as a dynamical axion field and can be thought of as emergent axion particles.@xcite thus , aside from possible practical applications , crystalline solids with topologically non - trivial band structures have the potential to provide tabletop laboratories for the testing and exploration of fundamental physical paradigms .",
    "a fundamental property of the axion medium is the witten effect:@xcite in the quantum theory , a magnetic monopole of unit strength ( i.e.  projecting magnetic flux @xmath14 ) immersed in an axion medium must carry electric charge @xmath3 with @xmath4 integer .",
    "this effect , although theoretically well established , has never been experimentally tested because until now both a suitable axion medium and the means to produce a magnetic monopole have been lacking . in this study",
    "we demonstrate how the connection between the axion response@xcite and strong topological insulators@xcite may serve to overcome both obstacles .",
    "we remark that a 1d realization of the witten effect in antiferromagnetic spin chains was proposed a long time ago.@xcite here we furnish the first concrete physical example of the witten effect in 3d by modeling a sti with a magnetic monopole inserted in its bulk .",
    "we show that the monopole binds a fractional charge @xmath15 consistent with witten s prediction.@xcite we then discuss possible ways to overcome the second obstacle by creating an _ emergent _ magnetic monopole in a topological insulator .",
    "this can be achieved by exploiting the degrees of freedom associated with a vortex in the exciton condensate that may emerge in a thin film topological insulator under external bias.@xcite we conclude that the prospects for experimental verification of the witten effect in a tabletop experiment using a sti appear promising .",
    "we start with a brief overview of the witten effect .",
    "although the effect is quantum - mechanical in nature its essence can be understood by studying the classical maxwell s equations modified in the presence of @xmath16 .",
    "the axion term revises both gauss law and ampre s law by adding extra source terms,@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the fine structure constant and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the electric charge density and current , respectively .",
    "we observe that for uniform , constant @xmath1 , eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) revert to the familiar maxwell s equations , consistent with the notion that @xmath16 can be written as a total derivative in this case .",
    "an important related property@xcite is the periodicity under @xmath21 of the axion action @xmath22 , implying that @xmath1 can be chosen from the interval @xmath23 .",
    "now consider a unit monopole , @xmath24 , placed at the origin , in a medium initially characterized by @xmath25 .",
    "we wish to understand what happens when we turn on @xmath1 as a function of time ( but keep it uniform in space ) . to this end we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( no currents in vacuum ) and take the divergence of eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) to obtain @xmath28 we see that an electric field is generated in this process .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) over space and time , we find that this field can be thought of as originating from a point electric charge @xmath29 located at the origin with magnitude @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the net change in @xmath1 and we assumed that there was no initial electrical charge bound to the monopole , as should be the case for a charge - conjugation and parity ( cp ) invariant theory@xcite with @xmath32 . in a topological insulator @xmath33 , thus one expects a magnetic monopole to bind fractional charge @xmath34 the integer @xmath4 accounts for the possibility of binding extra electrons , which can always occur  only the fractional part of @xmath29 is non - trivial .",
    "we now specify our model for a topological insulator and show that it indeed possesses the axion term . in order to minimize computational difficulties we consider a very simple model , inspired by ref . , with electrons hopping on the cubic lattice with two orbitals per site , denoted as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath37 , consists of a spin dependent part , with hopping between neighboring sites of the lattice , @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 labels sites of the cubic lattice , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are pauli matrices in orbital and spin space , respectively , @xmath43 , and the spin - independent terms that connect the two orbitals , @xmath44 although the model specified by eqs .",

    "we show below that for a range of parameters @xmath45 it represents a topological insulator , and therefore can be adiabatically deformed into any of the more realistic models@xcite characterized by the same topological invariants . any physical property that depends only on the topological invariants , such as the electrical charge bound to a monopole ,",
    "can thus be calculated in the present model and the result will remain applicable to any topological insulator in the same topological class .",

    "our hamiltonian has a simple representation in momentum space , @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the spectrum of excitations has two doubly degenerate bands , @xmath49 in the limit @xmath50 the bands touch at 8 non - equivalent dirac points located at @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "these @xmath53 also coincide with the 8 time - reversal invariant momenta@xcite ( trim ) .",
    "when @xmath54 are small but non - zero , the low - energy excitations of the system can be described in terms of 8 massive dirac hamiltonians @xmath55 obtained by a straightforward expansion of @xmath56 to linear order in momentum in the vicinity of @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath57 are the cartesian components of the dirac velocities at @xmath53 and @xmath58 are the corresponding dirac masses .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath59 show spectra @xmath60 the system described by hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) is inversion symmetric and we can thus employ the method devised in ref .   to determine the topological class of its insulating phases when the negative - energy bands are filled with electrons .",
    "this straightforward method requires computing the eigenvalues of the parity operator at the 8 trim for the occupied bands .",

    "we evaluate @xmath1 for our model using the non - abelian berry connection @xmath67,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is an eigenstate of @xmath56 , the trace extends over occupied states and @xmath69 .",
    "the integral indicated in eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) is generally difficult to evaluate and numerical methods must be used to obtain @xmath1 for an arbitrary band structure . for a model in which the band touching is described by dirac hamiltonians , however , a simple analytical evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) is possible by noticing that in the limit of a small dirac mass the entire contribution to the integral comes from the dirac points .",
    "we show in the appendix that each dirac point contributes @xmath70 to the total @xmath71 .",
    "although eq.([thetai ] ) has been derived for the case @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is because the value of @xmath1 in a tri insulator is quantized and can only change when a band crossing closes the gap .",
    "as long as band crossings occur only at @xmath53 points and are described by dirac hamiltonians , @xmath1 will be determined by eq .",
    "( [ thetai ] ) , even when @xmath73 is not small .",
    "it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ thetai ] ) gives the anticipated result for our model .",
    "consider first the situation when @xmath74 which according to table i is a trivial insulator .",
    "in this case all 8 masses @xmath75 are positive .",
    "since four of the products @xmath76 are positive and four are negative eq.([thetai ] ) gives @xmath32 , as expected",
    ". now suppose we tune @xmath61 so that its value drops below @xmath77 .",
    "this reverses the sign of a single dirac mass at @xmath78 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath79 also reverses sign and we obtain @xmath5 , as expected for a sti . for all other cases the values of @xmath1 are listed in table i. these results confirm the one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath63 invariant @xmath9 and the axion parameter @xmath1 expressed by @xmath80 , as expected on very general grounds.@xcite",
    "we now consider a magnetic monopole in the interior of a sti .",
    "we model this situation by the hamiltonian @xmath81 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ hso ] ) and ( [ hcd ] ) with a monopole positioned at the center of a cubic unit cell .",
    "the magnetic field of the monopole couples to both the electron charge and the electron spin through the orbital and zeeman couplings , respectively .",
    "the form of the orbital coupling is dictated by gauge invariance and is thus universal ; in our lattice model it is implemented by the peierls substitution , which attaches factors @xmath82 to all hopping terms connecting sites @xmath83 and @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 is the magnetic vector potential .",
    "the zeeman coupling is of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the bohr magneton and @xmath88 denotes the electron spin . for free electrons",
    "@xmath89 is close to 2 but in solids the effective @xmath89 can be substantially larger . the zeeman coupling thus leads to an additional term in the hamiltonian , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the magnetic field at site @xmath40 of the lattice .",
    "this term is non - universal and its importance will depend on the ratio of @xmath92 to the other relevant energy scales in the hamiltonian set by @xmath93 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we solve the hamiltonian @xmath94 in a cube containing @xmath95 sites by exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "the monopole is placed inside the central unit cell ( at the origin ) , so that the magnetic field of the monopole is @xmath96 .",
    "we choose a gauge in which the system retains the four - fold rotational symmetry around the @xmath97 axis,@xcite @xmath98 , with @xmath99 the spherical angles . exploiting this symmetry",
    "we are able to simulate system sizes up to @xmath100 , which requires diagonalizing a complex valued hermitian matrix of size @xmath101 . in order to calculate the charge density at half filling",
    "we require knowledge of all the occupied eigenstates .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian , once with the magnetic monopole and once without , obtaining charge densities @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . the monopole - induced charge density @xmath104 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_monopole]a . to determine the total charge bound to the monopole we calculate the excess accumulated charge in a sphere of radius @xmath105 centered on the monopole , @xmath106 .",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "[ fig_monopole]b ) that it saturates at @xmath107 to within 4 significant digits , comparable to the accuracy of our numerics . for @xmath108",
    "we find two localized zero modes , one at the monopole and one on the surface .",
    "fractional charge bound to the monopole can be understood in this case by appealing to the standard arguments@xcite developed originally to describe charge fractionalization in polyacetylene.@xcite briefly , when a topological defect ( such as a domain wall in polyacetylene ) produces a localized zero mode inside the gap in a particle - hole symmetric system , one can show that the spectral weight of the state contains equal contributions from the valence and the conduction bands .",
    "thus , the valence band shows a net deficit of half a state in the vicinity of the defect .",
    "this translates into the defect carrying fractional charge @xmath15 , the sign depending on whether the zero mode is empty or occupied .",
    "like in polyacetylene we find the saturation of charge to be exponential @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the bulk gap .",
    "when @xmath112 , the zeeman coupling causes changes in the charge distribution near the monopole but the total accumulated charge remains quantized at @xmath107 . in this case",
    "there are no exact zero modes in the spectrum and @xmath113 approaches @xmath114 as a power law with the exponent close to @xmath115 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_monopole]c ) .    the power - law dependence can be understood as follows .",
    "the zeeman term acts as an additional time - reversal breaking field which modifies the value of axion @xmath1 away from @xmath116 close to the monopole .",
    "this causes non - vanishing @xmath117 and thus , according to eq.([gausslaw ] ) , additional contribution to the effective charge density .",
    "the simplest assumption , @xmath118 , gives @xmath119 and @xmath120 , a power law but with the exponent not quite in agreement with our numerical simulation .",
    "on further reflection one realizes that in our model @xmath121 can not be proportional to @xmath122 but rather must be proportional to its gradients .",
    "this is because in the presence of a uniform zeeman term the system remains inversion - symmetric .",
    "inversion symmetry dictates quantized value of @xmath123 even when @xmath124 is explicitly broken.@xcite thus , non - vanishing @xmath121 requires spatially varying zeeman field .",
    "the simplest assumption satisfying these requirements is @xmath125 . in the vicinity of the monopole one finds @xmath126 and @xmath127 in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "we note that the above considerations are based on the effective axion action ( [ ax ] ) and apply on lengthscales large compared to @xmath128 .",
    "the power law tail in the fractional charge distribution for @xmath112 appears on top of a short - lengthscale structure with a roughly exponential profile that is controlled by the properties of the microscopic hamiltonian and is thus non - universal . at the intermediate lengthscales",
    "the interplay of the two contributions can give rise to interesting structures such as the peak in @xmath113 at @xmath129 seen in fig .",
    "1b for @xmath130 .    by the same method described above",
    "we have investigated spin density induced by the monopole .",
    "we find that there is no net spin @xmath131 attached to the monopole .",
    "thus , in addition to charge fractionalization , a magnetic monopole inserted in a sti constitutes an example of spin - charge separation in three spatial dimensions .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising in view of the fact that spin - orbit coupling present in the hamiltonian ( [ hso ] ) breaks the su(2 ) spin symmetry and , as a result , electron spin is not a good quantum number in the model describing our system .",
    "although there is no known theoretical principle that prohibits the existence of fundamental magnetic monopoles in nature,@xcite none have been observed to date despite extensive searches.@xcite this null observation has led to a consensus that fundamental monopoles either do not exist for some heretofore unknown reason or they are very rare in our part of the universe . in either case the observed absence of fundamental monopoles poses a challenge to the idea of experimental verification of the witten effect using a sti . at best , one could conceive of a new scheme for possible _ detection _ of magnetic monopoles using a sti in the role of a sensor if a convenient way to detect the fractional charge could be found .",
    "a much more promising avenue for the verification of the witten effect is suggested by exploiting _",
    "emergent _ instead of fundamental monopoles .",
    "a classic example of such an emergent behavior in a crystalline solid is the 2007 theoretical prediction@xcite and the subsequent experimental observation@xcite of monopoles in frustrated magnetic systems called ` spin ice ' , realized in certain magnetic pyrochlore compounds such as dy@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath132 or ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath132 .",
    "magnetic monopoles in these systems arise as elementary excitations above the collective ground state of spins and the monopole - like magnetic field configuration originates from the magnetic moments of the constituent spins . in principle , the emergent monopoles in the spin ice could be used to test the witten effect if a compound that is simultaneously a sti _ and _ a spin ice could be identified .",
    "unfortunately no such material is known at present although we note that sti behavior has been theoretically predicted to occur in crystals with the same pyrochlore structure@xcite that underlies the spin ice behavior .",
    "it is thus possible that a suitable material will be discovered in the future .",
    "here we focus on a different type of emergent magnetic monopole that can arise in a thin film sti placed in a uniform external electric field . the basic idea and the feasibility of its experimental realization",
    "have been discussed in ref .. following that work we envision the simplest sti with just one gapless dirac state per surface and the chemical potential initially tuned to the neutral point . when a strong enough electric field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the film the chemical potential undergoes a shift that is opposite in the two surfaces .",
    "this creates a small electron fermi surface in one surface and a small hole fermi surface in the other .",
    "the essence of the proposal@xcite lies in the observation that an arbitrarily weak coulomb interaction between the surface states produces an exciton condensate , which may be viewed as a coherent fluid of electron - hole pairs drawn from the opposite surfaces .",
    "such an exciton condensate is characterized by a complex scalar order parameter @xmath133 , which can fluctuate in space and time . in particular @xmath134",
    "can contain _ vortices _  point - like topological defects with the phase @xmath135 winding by @xmath136 around a vortex .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref . that to electrons in a sti such a vortex is indistinguishable from a ` planar monopole ' , i.e.  a monopole with magnetic field radiating in the plane of the surface .",
    "a planar monopole can be viewed as an adiabatic deformation of an ordinary monopole achieved by flattening the field lines in a cylindrically symmetric fashion .",
    "one expects that the total charge bound to the monopole via the witten effect should be insensitive to such an adiabatic deformation and therefore a vortex in the exciton condensate should bind fractional charge @xmath15 .",
    "this indeed has been argued to happen in ref .",
    "based on the dirac equation describing the low - energy physics of the surface states in the presence of the exciton condensate . here ,",
    "taking a more general point of view , we establish the existence of the fractional charge in such a condensate by studying a planar monopole embedded inside a sti .",
    "our calculation below does not rely on the low - energy approximation for the surface states and is insensitive to the detailed microscopic structure of the condensate .",
    "rather , it exploits only the most fundamental property of the sti given by its nontrivial axion response .    in general , the fractional charge is expected to be robust against weak disorder that does not break tri .",
    "such a disorder will be present in a real sample and we model it here by adding a term @xmath137 to the hamiltonian .",
    "the first term represents a parity - preserving on - site disorder ( independent of the orbital ) , while the second term is a parity breaking disorder .    as before we solve the hamiltonian @xmath138 , in a cube containing @xmath139 sites , by exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "the planar monopole projects an effective magnetic field @xmath140 ( in cylindrical coordinates ) and the vector potential can be chosen as @xmath141 .",
    "the effective field does not couple to electron spin,@xcite so there is no zeeman term in this case .",
    "the disorder coefficients @xmath142 are chosen from a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath143 .",
    "note that the disorder breaks the four - fold rotational symmetry of the system , so we can not exploit this symmetry in this case to efficiently diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently we are limited to system sizes up to @xmath144 . for weak disorder",
    "@xmath145 the charge bound to the planar monopole remains @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_plmonopole ] ) , and for strong disorder @xmath146 the charge bound is zero . remarkably , even for fairly significant disorder ( such that it generates charge density fluctuations comparable to the charge density induced by the monopole ) the difference in charge density @xmath147 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_plmonopole]f is only weakly affected .    in the framework of the current proposal the key ingredient required to produce",
    "a monopole - like configuration is the exciton condensate . as explained in ref .",
    "it is difficult to reliably estimate the critical temperature @xmath148 for the formation of the exciton condensate , but under optimal conditions it should be higher than it is in bilayer graphene , where the occurrence of this effect is hotly debated .",
    "once the exciton condensate is formed , vortices can be nucleated by applying an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "since the exciton condensate is itself insulating , the main conduction channel in this situation will be through vortices , each carrying @xmath107 charge .",
    "fractional charge of the carriers then can be detected using established techniques.@xcite",
    "predicted more than 30 years ago in the context of high - energy physics , but never before observed in a real or numerical experiment , the witten effect is realized in a strong topological insulator . a unit magnetic monopole inserted in a model",
    "sti binds electric charge @xmath107 in accordance with the prediction@xcite and furnishes a rare example of charge fractionalization and spin - charge separation in 3 spatial dimensions . in the special case when the underlying system possesses particle - hole symmetry and",
    "when the zeeman term ( [ hz ] ) can be neglected , the appearance of fractional charge follows from the same ` zero - mode ' arguments that underlie charge fractionalization in a one - dimensional system of fermions coupled to a scalar field with a soliton profile@xcite as realized in dimerized polyacetylene.@xcite in the more general case when the zeeman term or weak disorder are present , there exist no exact zero modes in the spectrum of electrons yet the fractional charge remains precisely quantized .",
    "this reflects the more subtle topological order that underlies the axion response of a sti , which is robust against any weak perturbation that respects time reversal symmetry.@xcite    an interesting open question is the fate of the witten effect in the presence of magnetic disorder .",
    "experimentally , this can be implemented by adding a small concentration of magnetic ions ( such as fe or mn ) into a topological insulator .",
    "although at the microscopic level @xmath1 is no longer quantized in the presence of @xmath149-breaking perturbations , we expect its effective value , relevant to the physics at long lengthscales , to remain pinned at @xmath116 as long as the magnetic moments stay disordered .",
    "this is because the net magnetic moment in a macroscopic region containing many impurities will effectively vanish .",
    "qualitatively , this suggests that the witten effect may survive inclusion of a moderate concentration of magnetic dopants with randomly oriented moments . at low temperatures moments",
    "may order ferromagnetically.@xcite in this case both @xmath149 and the inversion symmetry are broken ( the latter due to the random position of magnetic dopants ) and the effective @xmath1 can acquire an arbitrary value . in this situation we expect a monopole to still bind fractional charge according to eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) but we leave a detailed study of this case to future investigation .    can the witten effect be observed experimentally in the near future ?",
    "we believe that the answer is affirmative",
    ". one essential ingredient , the axion medium , is now widely available in any of the recently discovered stis.@xcite if an emergent monopole can be realized , exploiting the proposed exciton condensate,@xcite the spin ice - type physics,@xcite or by some other means , then the experimental challenge is reduced to designing a suitable method for the detection of fractional charge bound to the monopole .",
    "the fractional charge of elementary excitations in fractional quantum hall fluids has been previously detected@xcite and it should be possible to adapt these methods to topological insulators . in this way , studies of crystalline quantum matter with non - trivial topological properties could help settle one of the enduring challenges of fundamental physics and provide new insights into the behavior of electrons placed in unusual situations .",

    "<S> a key manifestation of the axion term is the witten effect : a unit magnetic monopole placed inside a medium with @xmath2 is predicted to bind a ( generally fractional ) electric charge @xmath3 with @xmath4 integer . </S>",
    "<S> here we conduct a first test of the witten effect based on the recently established fact that the axion term with @xmath5 emerges naturally in the description of the electromagnetic response of a new class of crystalline solids called topological insulators  </S>",
    "<S> materials distinguished by strong spin - orbit coupling and non - trivial band structures . using a simple physical model for a topological insulator </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the existence of a fractional charge bound to a monopole by an explicit numerical calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a scheme for generating an ` artificial ' magnetic monopole in a topological insulator film , that may be used to facilitate the first experimental test of witten s prediction . </S>"
