    "physical variables observed / measured by advanced data acquisition systems in real world applications are often processed , modelled , and analysed in order to extract information about the process . in many cases , long term observation ( long might mean very different period depends on application ) in fact consists of different processes that coexist or occur one after the other .",
    "there are many examples that during single observation process a reveals very different properties than process b and they can not be processed / analysed with the same tools ( simple example is switching from stationary to non - stationary signal ) .",
    "less radical case is that two segments might have the same type of model , but with different order and values of parameters .",
    "it leads to conclusion that very first step in experimental data analysis is signal segmentation , i.e. dividing the raw observation into smaller pieces ( segments ) with homogeneous properties .",
    "note that process a or process b might be single process or mixture of processes",
    ".    from signal processing perspective , one of the most fundamental reason for segmentation is finding locally stationary segments in non - stationary signals .",
    "in such a context the segmentation is a problem of identifying the time instants at which the statistics of the observed signal changes .",
    "signal segmentation is also generalized and considered in the context of signal detection and localization by means of recognition and identification of the time of appearance of event that differs from `` normal '' signal , @xcite .",
    "it could be generalized to a model proposed in @xcite presented in fig .",
    "[ lop ] .        .    the basis ( criterion ) for signal segmentation might be different in various domains , contexts and applications",
    ". change of process from process a to process b might be related to appearance of seismic event , machine regime switching , fault in the system , financial crash on stock market , natural radiation , wind behavior , etc .",
    "a key issue is to find proper description of processes in order to highlight the difference between them . in some cases ,",
    "the difference between processes is visually identifiable , but often advanced processing is required to find breakpoint .",
    "signal segmentation might be done in different manners .",
    "some of the methods are based on the statistical properties of raw time series @xcite or its modeling and analysis of model residuals @xcite .",
    "the second group of segmentation methods takes under consideration not the raw signal but its transformation to other domain , like spectral @xcite , cepstral @xcite , time - frequency @xcite , etc . in the literature one can also find segmentation techniques based on the raw time series decomposition such as empirical mode or wavelets decomposition @xcite .",
    "signal segmentation has been applied in many areas .",
    "it is especially crucial in condition monitoring ( to isolate shocks related to damage ) @xcite , machine performance analysis ( to find when machine operates under overloading , idle mode etc ) @xcite , experimental physics @xcite , biomedical signals ( like ecg signals ) @xcite , speech analysis ( automatic speech recognition and understanding ) @xcite , econometrics @xcite and seismic signal segmentation @xcite",
    ". the other areas where the segmentation problem appears one can find in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we propose a novel segmentation technique .",
    "this method is an extension of the algorithm proposed in @xcite , where the main statistics used to segmentation was based on the empirical second moment of raw data .",
    "an approach proposed here is a step forward in this field .",
    "the introduced method is based on the behaviour of the average absolute deviation about the empirical median of given time series . for the data where some statistical properties ( expressed mostly by the scale parameter ) change over time , the simple statistics applied here changes its behaviour which leads to structural break detection .",
    "the proposed method is much more sensitive for such cases where the change point is not visually identifiable in the contrast to the method presented in @xcite .",
    "moreover it can be used to different raw signals without assumption of their distributions which is the main advantage . on the one hand",
    "we analyse visually the mentioned statistics but on the other hand the strict method of change point detection is introduced .",
    "the method uses the adaptive regression splines technique which is a form of regression analysis .",
    "it is a non - parametric regression technique and can be seen as an extension of linear systems that automatically models non - linearities and interactions between variables @xcite .",
    "additionally , we propose a statistical test which allows for testing if given data satisfy the behaviour presented in fig .",
    "because in the analysis we consider the case where only one change point exists then the time series @xmath0 which is tested here , similar as in @xcite , can be written in the following mathematical form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a structural break point and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent random variables with cumulative distribution functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the motivation of our analysis is the time series presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : real_timeseries ] where we observe very specific behavior , similar to this described above .",
    "namely , the visual inspection of the data indicates the statistical properties of raw signal change and there appears problem of structural break point detection , i.e. how to recognize automatically the changing point .",
    "the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : real_timeseries ] represent the vibration signal from a heavy duty crusher used in a mineral processing plant . in the signal",
    "we observe that some statistical properties change over time which may be related to the different modes of operation of the machine .",
    "it was proved in many publications related to condition monitoring of machines , that vibration response significantly depends on external load applied to the machine . in the case of crusher , load applied to machine means volume of material stream directed to crushing machine .",
    "depends on the volume as well as structure of material stream ( size of stones ) statistical properties of vibration will be different .",
    "it is practically very hard to `` quantify '' properties of material stream . by vibration signal segmentation",
    "we can find segments with homogeneous content that corresponds to `` stable '' or `` stationary '' material stream .",
    "let us emphasize , observing the signal presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : real_timeseries ] , panel a ) it seems that the structural break points are easy detectable here . however",
    "if we analyse separately the subsignals corresponding to number of observations between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see panel b ) ) and @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see panel c ) ) we can conclude that in order to solve the problem of structural break point detection we have to use advanced statistical methods .     and @xmath8 ( panel b ) ) and @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( panel c ) ) .",
    "]    .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : methodology ] we introduce the methodology related to the new segmentation technique and compare it to the method presented in @xcite .",
    "we propose here the visual test based on the average absolute deviation about the empirical median of given time series as well as the new method of structural point detection based on the adaptive regression splines technique .",
    "next , we apply the proposed methodology to the various cases of simulated data with different distributions .",
    "we show the efficiency of the introduced method and their sensitivity for change point detection especially in case where it is not visually identifiable .",
    "we indicate the new technique can be also applied for data with heavy tailed distribution ( like lvy stable ) because it is based only on the empirical median of raw signal which always has finite value . in section [ sec : realdataanalysis ] we analyze the real data set presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : real_timeseries ] in the context of structural change point detection . at the end",
    "we recognize the distributions of segmented parts .",
    "last section contains conclusions .",
    "in this part , we introduce a new method of estimating the critical point of scale parameter for time series satisfying property given in . the general idea of the estimation procedure",
    "is closely linked to the approach introduced in @xcite , briefly described in the next part of this article , namely in section  [ sec : gajdaetall ] .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , our methodology is based on the behavior of the absolute deviation about median defined as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the median of time series @xmath13 . under the assumption that the underlying sample @xmath13 satisfies relation",
    ", we calculate the critical change point @xmath2 at which shift in the scale parameter occurs .",
    "it can be shown that in this case the estimated value of the statistics takes the following form @xmath14 in the above formulation of the problem the procedure of estimating the critical change point @xmath2 is equivalent to the approach presented in @xcite .",
    "one may easily proof by performing simple algebra that equation ( [ eq : basicmarsmodel ] ) can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the coefficients of the linear regressions fitted for two different segments of data separated by the point @xmath2 at which shift of the scale parameters occurs . for the purpose of estimating parameters @xmath17 defined in we use a non - parametric regression technique , called multivariate adaptive regression splines .",
    "for the sake of clarity we drop the description of the multivariate adaptive regression splines technique and describe it in the subsequent section , namely section  [ sec : mars ] . for the purpose of testing of the occurrence of change defined in terms of the scale parameters of random variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 in relation , we consider test proposed by @xcite , where the authors test the hypothesis that @xmath18 against alternatives of the form @xmath19 for @xmath20 . following the procedure described in @xcite , the two samples are ordered in a single joint array and ranks are assigned from each end of the joint array towards the middle .",
    "more formally , assuming that the two samples corresponding to random variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 from relation consisting of @xmath21 and @xmath22 independent observations are ranked in a combined array represented by @xmath23 if @xmath24 then the vector of ranks @xmath25 , @xmath26 is as follows @xmath27 and , if @xmath24 is odd , the ranks are given in the following way @xmath28 finally , the test statistic @xmath29 under consideration is defined as the sum of the ranks given in or associated with sample @xmath3 . in the testing procedure we use the modified version of the statistics @xmath29 , namely @xmath30 defined as @xmath31 under the null hypothesis , @xmath18 the limiting distribution ( where @xmath21 tends to @xmath32 ) of the statistics @xmath30",
    "is characterized by a standard normal distribution @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the corresponding @xmath34-value of statistics is calculated as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is defined as a cumulative distributive function of a standard normal distribution .",
    "if the @xmath34-value is equal to or smaller than the predefined significance level @xmath37 we reject the null hypothesis @xmath38 , i.e. the time series under consideration does not satisfy the relation given in , in favor of the alternative hypothesis @xmath39 stating that the observed time series has at least two regimes with different scale parameters .",
    "multivariate adaptive regression splines ( mars ) approach is a non - parametric , spline - based regression technique introduced in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a set of explanatory variables @xmath40 , a target variable @xmath41 and @xmath42 realizations of the process @xmath43 , whereas the true relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath41 is given in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an unknown function , and the error term @xmath47 is a white noise",
    ". the general idea of the mars is to use the expansions in piecewise linear basis functions of the form @xmath48 and @xmath49 , both called hockey stick basis functions with knot values set to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 the general idea of the mars is to form a set of pairs @xmath52 consisting of basis functions given in for each input variable @xmath53 with knots at each observed values @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the set of basis functions is given as @xmath55 under multivariate adaptive regression splines approach the set of basis functions defined in is used to construct the final model as follows @xmath56 where each @xmath57 is a function formed by taking single element from the initial set of basis functions @xmath52 , or a product of two or more such elements ( functions ) .",
    "the way of estimating the parameters of the mars model consists of two stages . at the first stage",
    "the mars performs a forward stepwise regression procedure by considering at each stage a new basis pair from @xmath52 including all possible interaction among explanatory variables and finally adding the pair of basis functions to the final model set @xmath58 based on the residual squared error criterion . to make mars approach computationally less expensive ,",
    "the level of interactions among explanatory variables , as well as the maximum number of basis functions in model while performing the forward stepwise procedure are specified by the user .",
    "the forward stepwise regression procedure always starts by considering the initial model set @xmath58 consisting only of the constant function @xmath59 . at the end of this procedure",
    "we have a large model of the form that typically overfits the data .",
    "the problem of overfitting the data is resolved by applying a backward stepwise regression procedure in the second step . in this step ,",
    "the terms whose removal causes the smallest increase in residual squared error is deleted from the model @xmath58 at each stage , producing an estimated best model @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the number of terms defined in the considered model .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath61 is calculated on the basis of the generalized cross - validation criterion defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a penalty factor accounting for the increase variance resulting from a complex model and @xmath64 is the effective number of parameters , including both number of terms in the models and the number of parameters used for selecting the optimal location of the knots .",
    "in this subsection we briefly recall the general idea of the regime variance testing presented in @xcite .",
    "the procedure is based on the behaviour of the empirical second moment of a given one - dimensional sample @xmath13 .",
    "namely , the authors consider statistics given in the following form @xmath65 under the assumption that the random variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 defined in have distributions with finite second moments @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , the statistics @xmath68 has the following property @xmath69 if @xmath70 , then the mean of @xmath68 statistics is equal to @xmath71 for all @xmath72 , therefore for independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) sample , the expected value of the statistics is a linear function with the shift parameter equal to zero .",
    "similar behaviour of @xmath73 is also observed under the milder assumption that the corresponding random variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 given in have distributions with infinite second moments . according to @xcite , the algorithm of estimating the critical point @xmath2 for the sample that fulfills relation starts with dividing for the fixed @xmath74 the @xmath68 statistics into two disjoint sets @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "next , the algorithm fits the linear regression lines for the first and the second set , respectively by minimizing the sum of squared error .",
    "subsequently , the estimator @xmath77 of the true change point @xmath2 is defined as the number @xmath78 that minimizes the following expression @xmath79\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the values of the linear functions fitted to the data belonging to the appropriate set of points @xmath75 and @xmath76.in the last step of the procedure , the underlying time series @xmath82 is divided into two vectors @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 $ ] , where quantiles ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) from the distributions of the squared time series from the vector @xmath87(for that the empirical standard deviation was smaller ) are calculated according to the formula @xmath88 where @xmath37 is a given significance level .",
    "the above formula is used to construct the @xmath38 hypothesis defined as previously : observed time series does not satisfy relation , whereas the alternative hypothesis @xmath39 is formulated as : observed time series has at least two regimes of the data for which the appropriate quantiles of the squared time series are different . under the @xmath38 hypothesis ,",
    "the appropriate quantiles can be determined on the basis of the empirical cumulative distribution function . due to the fact that @xmath89 are independent , the statistics @xmath90 given as @xmath91 has a binomial distribution with parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this section is supposed to describe the main differences between the methodologies described in the foregoing sections , see sections  [ sec : scalebased ] and  [ sec : gajdaetall ] .",
    "the main difference comes from the problem of detecting an appropriate change point at which the shift in the dispersion of a distribution has taken place is tackled by using two different measures of variability of the distribution .",
    "namely , the average absolute deviations about median and the second moment of a given sample have been considered .",
    "the former is used as a direct measure of scale parameters of a distribution with cumulative distribution function @xmath94 satisfying relation @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a scale parameter .",
    "the latter one is defined in a more systematic way by measuring the variability of distribution in terms of the empirical variance . as it appears that the graphs of diagnostic statistics presented in and reveal the same `` hockey stick '' pattern for time series satisfying relation .",
    "however the shape of the function derived based on may contain points at which sudden jump ( discontinuity ) is observed , influencing the bias and variance of the true critical point estimator @xmath77 defined in @xmath97 . from the other hand ,",
    "the resulting graph of the statistics defined in is smoother than in case of diagnostic statistics considered in . as a consequence the obtained results of estimating the true critical point are more reliable comparing to those results obtained based on the behavior of the empirical second moment taken into consideration in @xcite .",
    "more details about the performance of the aforementioned statistics can be found in the successive part of this article , see section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "moreover the behaviour of both considered statistics , namely @xmath98 and @xmath68 for exemplary distributions of random variables @xmath99 and @xmath4 in relation is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : statsgraph ] .",
    "( red line ) and @xmath98 ( blue line ) statistics defined in and for time series driven by a combination of distributions with different set of parameters where the corresponding critical point @xmath2 has been planned at middle of the length of sample . ]",
    "in this section we describe the results of performed simulations for the methods presented in section [ sec : methodology ] and compare the robustness of detecting the critical point of the underlying sample satisfying relation .",
    "the comparison is made by simulating 1000 trajectories of length @xmath100 of stochastically independent random variables with the scale parameter change placed on 800th observation .",
    "for the purpose of simulations we consider two different set of scenarios of family of distributions as in @xcite .",
    "for the first scenario , where the difference between distributions of random variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 in equation ( [ eq : general ] ) is relatively small , we consider the following cases    * the pure gaussian case with @xmath101 and @xmath102 distribution for the first 800 and last 1000 observations , respectively . * the pure lvy - stable case with @xmath103 and @xmath104 distribution for the first 800 and last 1000 observations , respectively .",

    "two additional test cases have been added in order to test specific behaviour of time series extracted from the real data set presented in section  [ sec : realdataanalysis ] .",

    "<S> for many real data , long term observation consists of different processes that coexist or occur one after the other . </S>",
    "<S> those processes very often exhibit different statistical properties and thus before the further analysis the observed data should be segmented . </S>",
    "<S> this problem one can find in different applications and therefore new segmentation techniques have been appeared in the literature during last years . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new method of time series segmentation , i.e. extraction from the analysed vector of observations homogeneous parts with similar behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on the absolute deviation about the median of the signal and is an extension of the previously proposed techniques also based on the simple statistics . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the method of structural break point detection which is based on the adaptive regression splines technique , one of the form of regression analysis . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we propose also the statistical test which allows testing hypothesis of behaviour related to different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> first , the methodology we apply to the simulated signals with different distributions in order to show the effectiveness of the new technique . </S>",
    "<S> next , in the application part we analyse the real data set that represents the vibration signal from a heavy duty crusher used in a mineral processing plant .    </S>",
