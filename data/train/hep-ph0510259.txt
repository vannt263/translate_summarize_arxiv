    "the field of neutrino physics is rapidly developing after atmospheric neutrino oscillations and solar neutrino oscillations have been established @xcite .",
    "most neutrino experiments measure energy and angle of muons produced in neutrino - nucleus interactions and reconstruct the incident neutrino energy , which determines the neutrino oscillations . to reduce the systematic uncertainty of these experiments it is vital that the nuclear response to weak interactions be under control at a quantitative level .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches aimed at providing accurate predictions of neutrino - nucleus scattering observables are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite    at @xmath1=3 gev or less , quasi - elastic scattering and quasi - free @xmath2 production are the dominant neutrino - nucleus processes .",
    "however , reactions in this energy regime are associated with a wide range of momentum transfer , thus involving different aspects of nuclear structure .    in this short note",
    "we discuss results obtained using the many - body theory of electron - nucleus scattering in the impulse approximation ( ia ) regime ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) , as well as its extension to charged - current neutrino - induced reactions .",
    "we focus on the energy range @xmath3 gev , and analyze inclusive scattering of both electrons and neutrinos off oxygen , the main target nucleus in sk , k2k and other experiments .",
    "within the ia , the cross section of the process @xmath4 can be written in the form ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron energy loss , the spectral function @xmath7 yields the probability of finding a nucleon with momentum @xmath8 and removal energy @xmath9 in the nuclear target and the differential cross section @xmath10 describes the elementary electron - nucleon scattering process .    the cross section of eq .",
    "( [ sigm:1 ] ) is obtained under the assumption that final state interactions ( fsi ) between the struck nucleon and the spectator particles be negligible .",
    "however , coincidence @xmath11 data unequivocally show that fsi play a significant role , leading to a sizable reduction of the outgoing proton flux ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite )    a theoretical approach to include the effect of fsi in inclusive processes has been developed in ref . @xcite .",
    "the resulting cross section can be written in the convolution form @xmath12 the folding function @xmath13 appearing in the above equation , that reduces to a @xmath14-function in absence of fsi , is simply related to the propagator of the struck nucleon , evaluated within the eikonal approximation treating the spectator particles as fixed scattering centers @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the @xmath15 cross section off oxygen calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ sigm:1 ] ) and ( [ sigma : fsi ] ) using a spectral function obtained within the local density approximation @xcite is compared to the data of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the theoretical calculation , _ involving no adjustable parameters _ , provides a fairly accurate account of the measured cross sections in the region of the quasi - elastic peak .",
    "the effect of fsi , leading to a shift and a quenching of the peak , is clearly visible . for reference",
    ", the figure also shows the results of the fermi gas ( fg ) model , corresponding to fermi momentum @xmath16 mev and nucleon removal energy @xmath17 mev , which appear to largely overestimate the data .",
    "the failure of the theoretical calculations to reproduce the measured cross section in the region of the @xmath2-production peak is likely to be due to deficiencies in the description of the elementary electron - nucleon cross section @xcite .",
    "in addition to dynamical fsi , arising from by nuclear interactions , statistical correlations , leading to pauli blocking of the phase space available to the knocked - out particle , must be also taken into account . a rather crude prescription to estimate the effect of pauli blocking amounts to modifying the spectral function through the replacement @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the average nuclear fermi momentum .",
    "the effect of pauli blocking is hardly visible in the differential cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , as the kinematical setup corresponds to @xmath20 gev@xmath21 at the quasi - elastic peak . on the other hand",
    ", this effect becomes very large at lower @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , showing the calculated differential cross section @xmath22 of the process @xmath23 , for neutrino energy @xmath24 gev .",
    "the dashed and dot - dash lines correspond to the ia results with and without inclusion of pauli blocking , respectively .",
    "it clearly appears that the effect of fermi statistic in suppressing scattering shows up at @xmath25 gev@xmath21 and becomes very large at lower @xmath0 .",
    "the results of the full calculation , in which dynamical fsi are also included , are displayed as a full line .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] suggest that pauli blocking and fsi may explain the deficit of the measured cross section at low @xmath0 with respect to the predictions of monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "we have employed an approach based on nuclear many - body theory to compute inclusive electron- and neutrino - nucleus scattering cross sections in the kinematical region corresponding to beam energy @xmath26 1 gev , relevant to many neutrino oscillation experiments .    in the region of the quasi - elastic peak ,",
    "the results of our calculations account for the measured @xmath27 cross sections at beam energies between 700 mev and 1200 mev and scattering angle 32@xmath28 with an accuracy better than 10 % @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that the ability to yield quantitative predictions over a wide range of beam energies is critical to the analysis of neutrino experiments , in which the energy of the incident neutrino is not known , and must be reconstructed from the kinematics of the outgoing lepton .    in the region of quasi - free @xmath2 production",
    "theoretical predictions significantly underestimate the data . in view of the fact that the calculated cross sections are in close agreement with the data at higher energies @xcite ,",
    "i.e. in the region in which inelastic contributions largely dominate , this problem appears to be mainly ascribable to uncertainties in the description of the nucleon structure functions at low @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of pauli blocking , not included in the ia picture , while being hardly visible in the lepton energy loss spectra , produces a large effect on the @xmath0 distributions at @xmath25 gev@xmath21 , and must therefore be taken into account .",
