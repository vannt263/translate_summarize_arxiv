    "the discovery of weak ferromagnetism in la - doped cab@xmath2 is one of the greatest surprises in the recent study of ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "this material shows ferromagnetism with high curie temperature about @xmath3 and with small magnetic moment .",
    "et al._@xcite claimed that the theory of the excitonic ferromagnetism , which was originally proposed by volkov _",
    "et al._@xcite , can account for this curious ferromagnetism .",
    "their proposal has brought renewed interests in excitonic insulator , which was vigorously studied theoretically in 1960s .",
    "after the proposal by zhitomirsky _",
    ", some authors tried to improve their theory .",
    "balents and varma@xcite and barzykin and gorkov@xcite independently discussed that , to explain this ferromagnetism , the approximation of excitonic insulator should be improved by considering the formation of superstructure or long - range coulomb interaction",
    ".    the effect of impurities will also be important for the excitonic insulator . in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of impurities in excitonic insulators .",
    "the destruction of excitonic insulator by the impurity was discussed by zittartz@xcite .",
    "he showed that the intraband scattering by impurity reduces the energy gap just as the magnetic impurity in superconductor . in this paper",
    "we study the interband scattering by impurity .",
    "we show that the interband scattering cause the formation of the bound states and the reduction of the energy gap .",
    "we also show that this interband scattering breaks the @xmath4 symmetry of hamiltonian .",
    "this is due to the fact that the phase of the order parameter is determined by the difference of phase between conduction and valence bands .",
    "the reduction of the energy gap and the energy of the the bound state is controlled by the phase of order parameter .",
    "the phase dependence of the energy gap and the bound state brings the ferromagnetic ordering of doped electrons in triplet excitonic insulator , because the phase of order parameter differs by @xmath5 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this paper is constructed as follows .",
    "first , in the next section we introduce the hamiltonian and show the breaking of @xmath4 symmetry by the interband scattering . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bound - state ] and [ sec : gap - reduction ] we investigate the effect of impurities on the bound and continuum states .",
    "it is shown that the bound states emerge only when @xmath0 is positive and that the binding energy depends on the phase of the order parameter .",
    "we also show that the in the continuum states the energy gap is strongly suppressed when @xmath8 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bdg ] , we solve bogoliubov - de gennes equation for excitonic insulator numerically .",
    "the results support the analytic discussion above .",
    "we also find that , when @xmath9 is close to @xmath10 , magnetic moment of doped electrons is reduced . in the last section for summary and discussion , we discuss about the application of our results to the ferromagnetism in hexaborides .",
    "first we study the following hamiltonian @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are annihilation operators of electrons in the lower and upper band , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are kinetic energy of electrons , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are exchange and direct interaction between two bands .",
    "the nesting of fermi surfaces between two the electron bands brings the formation of excitonic order parameter@xcite .",
    "we introduce the interband scattering by impurity @xmath18 as @xmath19    this interband scattering is important because this term breaks the @xmath4 symmetry of the system .",
    "the hamiltonian([cleanhamiltonian ] ) for the clean system is invariant under the @xmath20 transformation , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "however , the interband scattering term reduces this symmetry to the diagonal @xmath4 symmetry because the @xmath23 transformation change the impurity term as @xmath24 , unless @xmath25 .",
    "this means that to discuss the impurity effect we must take the phase of excitonic order parameter , which corresponds to @xmath26 , into account .    here",
    "we note that in real materials this @xmath4 symmetry is generally broken even without impurities due to other interactions which are not included in the hamiltonian([cleanhamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the interband pair scattering term @xmath27 is one of such interactions .",
    "therefore we suppose the phase @xmath9 is determined by such term .",
    "it is interesting to study the stable phase @xmath9 and discuss the phase dynamics , however , this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "volkov _ et al .",
    "_ noticed that localized states with uncompensated spin appears in the doped triplet excitonic insulator@xcite .",
    "they concluded that the bound states appears only when @xmath28 is positive .",
    "their result means that the phase of the order parameter determines the existence of bound state .",
    "however , they assume that @xmath28 to be real , which is needed to be justified by further study . in this paper",
    ", we treat the order parameter as the complex variable . here",
    "we introduce the excitonic mean field order parameter @xmath29 and write down the mean - field hamiltonian in pure excitonic system @xmath30 when we use the hamiltonian ( [ cleanhamiltonian ] ) , order parameter @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 this hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation @xmath21 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is convenient to assume the order parameter @xmath29 to be real by choosing the appropriate gauge . in this case",
    ", the impurity scattering term ( [ impurityhamiltonian ] ) shows phase dependence , @xmath35 in the following two sections , we use hamiltonian([mfhamiltonian ] ) and ( [ impurity2 ] ) .",
    "first , we study the bound state around the impurity in excitonic insulator .",
    "we here consider the one - impurity problem . for simplicity , we assume the order parameter @xmath29 to be diagonal , @xmath36 . in the singlet excitonic insulator this assumption is correct .",
    "we note that in the triplet excitonic insulator we can justify this assumption if the three component of triplet order parameter @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are degenerate . in this case",
    ", we can treat up - spin and down - spin separately .",
    "then from ( [ mfhamiltonian ] ) the green s function in the mean - field theory is given by @xmath39    assuming the impurity potential as point - like , we can calculate the green s function @xmath40 using the t - matrix approximation , @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43    after some calculation with the assumption @xmath44 and constant density of states , we get @xmath45 and @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the density of states at fermi energy .    the determinant of matrix @xmath48 is given as @xmath49 where @xmath50 . from this expression , we find that when @xmath51 is positive @xmath52 has poles at @xmath53 and two bound states appear . on the other hand",
    ", when @xmath54 is negative , there exists no bound state .",
    "we conclude that the phase of the order parameter controls the energy and existence of bound states . if we set @xmath28 real and positive , there exist bound states at @xmath55 when @xmath56 . here",
    "we note that this bound state exists even if @xmath57 is very weak . as @xmath9 changes from 0 to @xmath10 , the energies of bound states approach to @xmath58 and at @xmath59 the bound states are touch the edges of the continuum",
    ".    it should be noticed there exists a great difference in the effect of impurities between the singlet excitonic insulator and the triplet one . in the singlet",
    "excitonic insulator , @xmath60 and both up - spin and down - spin bound states have the same energy . on the other hand , in the triplet excitonic insulator",
    ", @xmath61 and the bound states of up - spin and down - spin electrons can not exist at the same time .",
    "therefore spins of the electrons doped into the triplet excitonic insulator align ferromagnetically . for @xmath62 ,",
    "marginal bound states exist for both spin states and excitonic insulator remains paramagnetic .",
    "in the previous section , we studied the formation of a the bound state around an impurity .",
    "we found that a bound state appears only when @xmath51 is positive .",
    "however , the impurity will also influence the continuum state .",
    "for example , it is well known that magnetic impurities in a superconductor reduce the energy gap .",
    "zittartz discussed the effect of intraband scattering by impurities in excitonic insulator and found that it reduces the energy gap in exactly the same way as magnetic impurities do in a superconductor@xcite . in this section",
    ", we consider the reduction of energy gap by interband scattering term .",
    "to study the suppression of the energy gap , we use the same technique as abrikosov and gorkov@xcite used for a superconductor . for simplicity",
    "we again assume that the order parameter is diagonal in spin space .",
    "we introduce the renormalized green s function @xmath63 @xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the renormalized frequency and order parameter respectively , and we recovered the translational invariance of green s function of continuum states by averaging over the impurity positions .    using the born approximation , we get @xmath67 and @xmath68 integrating over @xmath69 we obtain @xmath70 where we assumed @xmath71 and constant density of states as before . after some calculations",
    "we get the following equations for @xmath65 and @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 here @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath56 , these equations are the same as those for magnetic impurities in a superconductor . therefore if @xmath56 , the energy gap is strongly suppressed by impurities . as @xmath9 develops from 0 , the energy gap increases and at @xmath76 ,",
    "the energy gap becomes almost as same as that of pure excitonic insulator , because at @xmath62 the equations ( [ omegatilde ] ) and ( [ deltatilde ] ) have the same form as those for non - magnetic impurities in a superconductor .",
    "the density of states of electrons @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 for some typical values of @xmath9 , we plot the density of states in fig .",
    "[ dosfigure ] . from this figure",
    ", we find that the reduction of the energy gap is maximum at @xmath56 .",
    "this is consistent with the above discussion .",
    "from the analysis in the previous sections , we found that the phase of the order parameter determines the existence of the bound state as well as the reduction of the energy gap .",
    "these two effects are not independent . for example , for the finite concentration of impurities",
    ", the bound states will form an impurity band . on the other hand ,",
    "if the energy gap of the continuum is strongly reduced , the energy of the bound state present for a single impurity model may be absorbed into the continuum for a finite impurity concentration . to study such possibilities ,",
    "in this section we solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for excitonic insulator numerically . we confine ourselves to the triplet case , because in the triplet excitonic insulators impurity may invoke magnetic moment as discussed in section [ sec : bound - state ] .",
    "we also show that incomplete ferromagnetism can appear .",
    "we start from the following hamiltonian @xmath79 the first term is the kinetic term of electrons . here",
    "we assume two - dimensional square lattice and the summation is carried out with nearest neighbor @xmath80 . in the theory of the excitonic insulator , it is often assumed that @xmath71 , so we take @xmath81 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the second term is the interaction term .",
    "the order parameter @xmath84 is determined from the hamiltonian ( [ cleanhamiltonian ] ) as    @xmath85    while for @xmath86 triplet state and singlet state are degenerate , positive @xmath17 suppresses singlet one . in the following numerical calculation",
    "we take @xmath17 large enough to suppress the singlet state completely .",
    "the third term describes the impurity scattering and the sum is carried out on the impurity site .",
    "the last two terms are the energy gap term , which determines the overlap of two bands . in the following , we set @xmath87 . under this assumption ,",
    "the fermi surfaces of two electron bands coincide when we dope no electron .",
    "the size of the fermi surfaces depends on @xmath88 . for @xmath89 , @xmath90 for any @xmath91 , and the system is a band insulator . on increasing @xmath92 ,",
    "the fermi surface emerges near @xmath93 and the system becomes a semi - metal . when @xmath94 it becomes a band insulator again , because @xmath95 .",
    "we solve equation ( [ bdghamiltonian ] ) and ( [ op - equation - realspace ] ) numerically keeping the number of electrons constant .",
    "first , we diagonalize the equation([bdghamiltonian ] ) and calculate the eigenenergy and eigenstates .",
    "next we take the eigenstates with small eigenvalues , up to the number of electrons .",
    "the order parameter is calculated by equation ( [ op - equation - realspace ] ) .",
    "we repeat these procedures iteratively until the solution converges .",
    "we change the phase @xmath9 by choosing the initial values of @xmath28 , and check the phase after convergence .",
    "we set parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the calculation is carried out on @xmath100 lattices .",
    "first we consider the case when the impurities are introduced into the non - doped excitonic insulator . in fig .",
    "[ op - phase ] we present the triplet order parameter @xmath101 axis when one impurity is introduced , setting the initial condition @xmath102 and @xmath10 .",
    "the order parameter is reduced at the impurity site .",
    "we note that in fig .",
    "[ op - phase](b ) @xmath9 differs from @xmath103 .",
    "this is due to the fact that after iteration @xmath9 deviates from the initial values .",
    "however , from fig .",
    "[ op - phase ] we find that the difference is small .    to see the reduction of energy gap , we need finite concentration of impurities . in fig .",
    "[ spectre ] we plot the single particle spectrum near @xmath104 when 10 impurities are introduced periodically .",
    "we find that the bound states appear around @xmath105 when @xmath56 .",
    "it should be noted that the all electrons in the bound state has up - spin , as shown in the right of the figure .",
    "the number of localized eigenstates with negative energy is the same as that of impurities .",
    "the energy of the bound states become large as @xmath9 changes from @xmath106 to @xmath10 , and vanish at @xmath10 , in consistent with our discussion . we also note that at @xmath107 the energy gap is larger than the case when @xmath108 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of section [ sec : gap - reduction ] .",
    "we note that at @xmath62 the gap seems to be smaller than the case when @xmath109 . at @xmath59 ,",
    "the bound states touch the edge of the continuum and hybridize with the continuum .",
    "the energy of eigenstates is lowered by this hybridization .",
    "now we turn to the case when electrons are doped . when doped into a triplet excitonic insulator",
    ", electrons will align ferromagnetically if @xmath110 . in the case of la@xmath111ca@xmath112b@xmath2 , la acts as both the impurity and electron donor .",
    "therefore we consider the case when the number of impurities and doped electrons are the same . in fig.[magnetic - moment ] we plot @xmath113 when 10 electrons and impurities are doped for @xmath114 .",
    "when @xmath56 we can see that localized magnetic moment appears around the impurity .",
    "total magnetic moment amounts to 10 , which means that all doped electrons have spin up . on the other hand , when @xmath62 no magnetic moment appears .",
    "therefore we can conclude when @xmath62 the doped triplet excitonic insulator is paramagnetic .",
    "these results are also consistent with our discussion . in the middle of these two limits",
    ", there may exists incomplete ferromagnetism . in fig.[magnetic - moment](b ) , we show the same plot for @xmath115 .",
    "we can see that magnetic moment become small , being 6 in total .",
    "this incomplete ferromagnetism is considered as follows .",
    "if the concentration of impurities is finite , associated impurity bound states form an impurity band . since the bound state energy approaches @xmath28 as @xmath116 , this impurity band has a finite overlap with the continuum state for @xmath9 sufficient close to @xmath10 . in this case",
    "ferromagnetic moment due to doped electrons will be reduced .",
    "on the basis of the results of the preceding sections , we first discuss the weak ferromagnetism in doped hexaborides . as discussed in this paper , doped triplet excitonic insulator with impurities shows ferromagnetism if phase @xmath9 is between @xmath117 and @xmath10 .",
    "the incomplete ferromagnetism can also occur when the energy gap becomes smaller than the bound state energy . here",
    "we discuss the possibility that the ferromagnetism of la - doped cab@xmath2 is caused by impurities .",
    "we assume that cab@xmath2 is the triplet excitonic insulator .",
    "when we dope la , la acts as impurity and cause interband scattering . as discussed in this paper , in the presence of interband scattering up - spin and down - spin does not compensate because of the emergence of localized moment if @xmath118 .",
    "therefore ferromagnetism emerges , which become incomplete when the reduced energy gap is smaller than the highest energy of impurity band . here",
    "we discuss the possibility of the impurity - induced ferromagnetism by this mechanism .",
    "first , we notice the ferromagnetism emerges only when excitonic order is spin - triplet .",
    "it is well known that direct interaction term suppresses the singlet order , while exchange interaction stabilize both singlet and triplet order by an equal amount .",
    "therefore only triplet order parameter will be realized when direct interaction is large enough .",
    "it seems natural to assume that the exchange interaction is the same order as the direct interaction . as shown in sec.[sec : bdg ] , triplet excitonic insulator is realized when @xmath17 and @xmath16 are the same order .",
    "second , the phase of order parameter must not be @xmath10 , in other words , the minimum of the total energy is achieved when @xmath119 . in our discussion , we do not discuss the value of @xmath9 which minimize the total energy . in our numerical calculation",
    "the change of energy by phase is very small . as noted in sec.[sec : breaking - symmetry ] in real materials there exist some other interactions which is not discussed here , such as interband pair scattering .",
    "these interactions also depend on the phase . because these interactions exist even without impurities , we think that the stable phase @xmath9 will be determined by such term.further study will be needed to determine the stable @xmath9 , however , there exists no reason to restrict @xmath62 .",
    "third , the minimum of the energy gap must be smaller than the energy of the impurity band . in our calculation",
    "it means that @xmath9 is close to @xmath10 .",
    "however , it should be noticed that there exists other origins of the reduction of the energy gap .",
    "for example , intraband scattering by impurities also decreases the energy gap , as discussed by zittartz@xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume la acts as the interband scattering potential .",
    "however , there exists other impurities or disorder in la@xmath111ca@xmath112b@xmath2 .",
    "these impurities and disorder will also acts as impurity potential .",
    "if these scattering is large enough , the energy gap will be reduced such that the energy of the bound states is larger than the gap .",
    "we conclude that the minimum of the gap can be smaller than the energy of the bound states .",
    "first , we only consider one pair of fermi surfaces , which shows completely nesting without doping .",
    "however , the band calculation of cab@xmath2 shows that there exist three pairs of imcompletely nested fermi surfaces .",
    "balents and varma@xcite discussed that in cab@xmath2 we must consider the possibility of the co - existence of gapped and ungapped fermi surfaces . in this case , though our theory should be modified , ferromagnetism will occure .",
    "our theory is based on the fact that green s function depends on the phase . even if gapless fermi surfaces exist , green s function @xmath120 will show the phase dependence .",
    "therefore the occurence of ferromagnetism will be suggested in this case .",
    "on the other hand , the formation of loff state discussed by barzykin and gorkov@xcite gives severe damage to our theory .",
    "if loff state appears , order parameter @xmath28 shows spatial modulation , such as @xmath121 . in this case , total magnetic moment will diappear , because the direction of local magnetic moment will be random .",
    "another important point we have neglected is the symmetry of the energy band .",
    "band calculation shows that the conduction band and the valence band have different symmetries , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "though a simple substitution of ca by la at a single site will reduce the symmetry , the rotational symmetry and parity around the impurity survive .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that interband scattering by la is forbidden by the symmetry .",
    "therefore for our theory we must assume the symmetry is lowerd at la site .",
    "for example , if the impurity locates at less symmetric position , these symmetries break down and intraband scattering is permitted .",
    "we also note that the disorder in the lattice will also cause the intraband scattering .",
    "though in the above discussion we have assumed that only la acts as interband scattering potential , interband scattering by disorder will also happen . in this case our theory does not modified , except that the number of impurities is different from that of doped electrons .    the readers will also notice that intraband scattering is neglected in our model .",
    "however we can show that the bound state can survive even if intraband scattering exists.when one impurity causes both interband and intraband scattering , the energy of localized state is determined by @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 is the strength of intraband scattering . if @xmath127 , equation ( [ inter - intra ] ) has two bound states when @xmath128 . in this case",
    "the discussion above is not qualitatively modified .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath129 , equation ( [ inter - intra ] ) has one bound state , independent of the sign of @xmath130 .",
    "however here we note the energy of bound state differs between positive and negative @xmath28 .",
    "therefore we conclude the ferromagnetism will also survive , though some modification will be needed .",
    "so far there are no direct evidence of this impurity - induced incomplete ferromagnetism in the hexaborides .",
    "however we note that we can account for the experimental inconsistencies on the value of the saturation moment of la@xmath111ca@xmath112b@xmath2 by this scenario .",
    "for example , in the first paper of fisk _ et al .",
    "_ the saturation moment is about 0.07@xmath131 per electron when @xmath132 , while terashima _",
    "reports that the saturation moment is about 0.25 @xmath131 with same doping , more than three times larger than that of fisk@xcite .",
    "we can explain this discrepancy by the difference of the density of impurities .",
    "more careful experiments on the magnetism will be needed to test the present theory .",
    "the measurement of the local magnetic moment will give much information about this .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the effect of the impurity in the excitonic insulator .",
    "the effect depends on the phase of the order parameter .",
    "the bound state appears when @xmath133 is positive , and the energy of the bound state depends on the phase of the order parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the reduction of the energy gap of continuum state becomes maximum when @xmath134 .",
    "numerical solution of bdg equation supports these discussion .",
    "based on these results , we proposed a new mechanism of incomplete ferromagnetism and applied it to the hexaborides .",
    "our theory qualitatively explains experiments , though further study will be needed .",
