    "when neutron was discovered by chadwick in 1932 , heisenberg came up with a new quantum number , the isotopic spin , to distinguish it from the proton .",
    "the associated noether symmetry @xmath4 valid for strong interactions tells us that their nuclear forces are essentially the same . now that we have three generations of quarks and three generation of leptons , all with the same standard model interactions",
    ", it seems natural that there would be a new quantum number and a new symmetry for them .",
    "this hypothetical symmetry is known as a horizontal symmetry , a family symmetry , or a generation symmetry .    unlike protons and neutrons , which have nearly the same mass , the masses of the three generations of fermions are vastly different .",
    "moreover , they mix .",
    "this suggests that if a horizontal symmetry exists , it has to be severely broken , presumably spontaneously , a fact which makes the identification of symmetry very difficult .",
    "there is however hope if the breaking leaves behind some unbroken residual symmetry that can be traced . in that case",
    ", group property of the symmetry can be invoked to reconstruct the unbroken horizontal symmetry from the residual symmetry .",
    "we will show in the next section that residual symmetries are present and located in the mixing matrix . in the case when neutrino mixing is given by the tribimaximal mixing matrix @xcite , the minimal horizontal symmetry group so obtained is @xmath3 , the permutation group of four objects .",
    "in this section we show how mixing determines the residual symmetry , and from there the horizontal symmetry .",
    "we also show how mixing can be obtained from a given horizontal group , using only symmetry arguments with no dynamical input .",
    "we will concentrate on leptonic mixing which produces a finite non - abelian symmetry group . the same procedure can in principle be used to study quark mixing , but no symmetry smaller than @xmath5 is obtained in that way . for more details of this approach , see refs .  [ 2 ] to [ 4 ] .",
    "let @xmath6 be the charged - lepton mass matrix , @xmath7 the neutrino dirac mass matrix , and @xmath8 the heavy majorana mass matrix in a type - i seesaw model .",
    "since a mixing matrix refers to the mixing of left - handed fermions , we can eliminate any reference to the right - handed fermions by considering the effective mass matrices @xmath9 for charged leptons , and @xmath10 for neutrinos , which connect only left - handed fermions with one another .",
    "the fact that @xmath11 is a symmetric rather than hermitian like @xmath12 is a reflection that neutrinos are ( assumed to be ) majorana particles .",
    "the pmns neutrino mixing matrix @xmath13 is the matrix that renders @xmath14 diagonal in the basis where @xmath12 is diagonal .",
    "suppose @xmath15 is a symmetry for left - handed charged - leptons and @xmath16 a symmetry for left - handed neutrinos .",
    "that means , @xmath17 are unitary matrices obeying @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we shall assume both of them to have a unit determinant so that they belong to @xmath5 .",
    "it can be shown from the majorana character @xmath20 that @xmath21 .",
    "that means @xmath16 has two @xmath22 eigenvalues and one @xmath23 eigenvalues . as a result , whatever the pmns mixing matrix @xmath13 is , there are exactly three residual symmetry operators @xmath16 given by .it is easy to see that the product of any two of them equals to the third , so they are the non - unit elements of an abstract @xmath24 group .",
    "the residual symmetry @xmath15 in the charged - lepton sector is different .",
    "since @xmath12 is diagonal and non - degenerate , all that is required is for @xmath15 to be diagonal and unitary .",
    "it can satisfy @xmath25 for any @xmath26 .",
    "we would however limit it to non - degenerate matrices , with three distinct eigenvalues , so that in the basis where @xmath15 is diagonal , @xmath12 is forced to be diagonal as well . in principle",
    "there are still an infinite number of these symmetry operators , forming an abstract group which is the direct product of any number of cyclic groups .",
    "any group @xmath0 generated by @xmath27 and at least one @xmath15 is a possible horizontal symmetry group of the left - handed fermions from which mixing @xmath13 can be obtained .",
    "the broken symmetries are those elements in @xmath0 not equal to @xmath15 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we want @xmath0 to be minimal , we pick only one @xmath15 , and the smallest possible @xmath15 at that",
    ". that would be @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath31 to denote the group generated by the matrices @xmath32 to @xmath33 . in that notation ,",
    "the horizontal symmetry group is @xmath34 .",
    "there are a few general things we can say about @xmath0 .",
    "to have a non - trivial mixing , @xmath28 must not be diagonal when @xmath15 is , hence @xmath0 is a non - abelian group . since it contains a subgroup generated by the @xmath28 s , its order must be a multiple of 4 .",
    "moreover , for almost all @xmath13 s , the order of the group @xmath0 would turn out to be infinite ; the symmetry operators @xmath27 have to be just right to produce a finite group @xmath0 .",
    "one of these very special @xmath13 s turns out to be the tribimaximal mixing matrix discussed below .",
    "let us now apply this general formalism to neutrino mixing observed experimentally .",
    "to within one standard deviation , the mixing matrix is consistent with the ` tribimaximal matrix ' ( tbm ) @xcite u_tbm=12&&0 - 1&&-1&&-,[tbm]whose mixing angles @xmath35 and cp phase @xmath36 are given by p:=_12,_23,_13e^-i=,1,0.[ptbm]the residual symmetries @xmath28 derived from this @xmath13 are g_1=131&-2&-2 - 2&-2&1 - 2&1&-2 ,  g_2=13 - 1&2&22&-1&22&2&-1 ,   g_3=-1&0&0 0&0&10&1&0.[ggg]defining an _ invariant eigenvector _ to be an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath23 , simply says that the normalized invariant eigenvector of @xmath28 is the @xmath37th column of the mixing matrix @xmath13 .",
    "thus in the case of tbm , @xmath38 is responsible for bimaximal mixing in the third column of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is responsible for trimaximal mixing in the second column .",
    "choosing @xmath29 to be the residual symmetry in the charged - lepton sector , the horizontal symmetry group generated by @xmath15 and the these three @xmath28 s turns out to be the symmetric group @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath15 is not given by @xmath41 , then the group @xmath0 is not @xmath3 .",
    "however , it can be shown that as long as @xmath0 is a finite subgroup of @xmath5 , it always contains @xmath3 as a subgroup @xcite .",
    "let us look at another example to further illustrate the general procedure .",
    "this example is unphysical , for its mixing angles and cp phase ( see for definition ) are @xmath42 , far from the experimental values . nevertheless , this example is useful in illustrating a couple of other things .",
    "the mixing matrix in this example is u_cw=11&1&1&1&^2^2&1&,[ucw]and the resulting residual symmetries @xmath28 computed from @xmath43 are g_1=13 - 1&2&2^22^2&-1&22&2^2&-1 ,  g_2=13 - 1&2&22&-1&22&2&-1 ,   g_3=13 - 1&2^2&2 2&-1&2^22^2&2&-1.[ggga4]note that @xmath40 is identical in and , but @xmath44 and @xmath38 are different , so a prime is put in to tell them apart .",
    "the group @xmath45 is now @xmath2 , the subgroup of @xmath3 consisting of even permutations of four objects .",
    "it turns out that @xmath46 is already @xmath3 and @xmath47 is already @xmath2 .",
    "the physical significance of this observation is explained below .",
    "remember that the normalized invariant eigenvector of @xmath28 is the @xmath37th column of the mixing matrix @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath40 is given , then the second column of @xmath13 is fixed .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath0 of @xmath13 depends on what we choose for the first and third columns , equivalently , what @xmath44 and @xmath38 are .",
    "most of the time the resulting group @xmath0 is very large , of infinite order . if we look at the other end of the spectrum , and ask how can they be chosen so that the resulting group @xmath0 is the smallest , namely @xmath48 , then the answer is that they must be @xmath49 and @xmath50 of . if we ask how can they be chosen to obtain the next smallest group , namely @xmath3 , then the answer is @xmath44 and @xmath38 of",
    "similarly , if the first column of the tbm matrix is given , then the smallest group @xmath51 is obtained by choosing the second and third columns of @xmath13 to be those of tbm .",
    "we can get a larger group , such as @xmath52 , by choosing these two columns differently , but most of the time we will end up with a group of infinite order for a random choice of these two columns .",
    "so far we have discussed how to obtain the unbroken horizontal symmetry group @xmath0 from a mixing matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the connection also works in the opposite direction , getting @xmath13 from a given @xmath0 .",
    "this can be done in the following way @xcite .",
    "first , identify all possible pairs of mutually commuting order-2 elements in @xmath0",
    ". these would be candidates for @xmath44 and @xmath40 , with @xmath38 given by @xmath53 .",
    "next , pick a @xmath15 from any other element with an order @xmath54 , provided its eigenvalues are non - degenerate .",
    "go to a 3-dimensional irreducible representation in which @xmath55 , in the basis where @xmath15 is diagonal .",
    "pick out the invariant eigenvectors @xmath56 of @xmath27 respectively .",
    "then the three columns of the mixing matrix @xmath13 are simply @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear that there is no way for group theory to tell which column is which , and similarly which row is which .",
    "hence the @xmath13 determined this way is unique only up to possible re - shuffling of rows and columns .",
    "moreover , since the majorana phases are not presently known , we can identify two @xmath13 s differed only by row and column phases .",
    "we will consider two @xmath13 s _ equivalent _ if they differ only by row and column phases , and row and column re - shuffling .",
    "one might think that there are so many ways to choose the pair @xmath59 and the element @xmath15 , that the number of @xmath13 s emerging would be so large to become unmanageable .",
    "it turns out that this is not the case as most of them are equivalent , leaving behind only very few inequivalent ones , at least for small groups . for @xmath60 , the only inequivalent mixing is given by . for @xmath3 , there are two inequivalent mixings , given by the tbm in , and another one with @xmath61 for @xmath62 , there are again only 2 inequivalent ones . for more detail",
    ", please see ref .",
    "sometimes we refer to this kind of mixing as _ full mixing _ , to distinguish it from a _ partial mixing _ , formed by one order-2 element @xmath16 and one order @xmath54 element @xmath15 picked from @xmath0 , with a second order-2 operator @xmath63 commuting with this @xmath16 picked arbitrarily , not necessarily from the group .",
    "if @xmath64 , then @xmath65 . if no adjective is attached , then mixing means full mixing . for example , tbm can be obtained as a full mixing of @xmath3 , or a partial mixing of @xmath2 .",
    "so far everything is derived from group - theoretical considerations , without any dynamical input .",
    "what would we gain by incorporating dynamics into consideration ? and , what kind of dynamics should we impose ?",
    "let me discuss the second question first .",
    "the dynamics should of course be invariant under the symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "we would also like the mixings derived from it to retain some memory of the group , namely , to have at least one residual symmetry each to be a member of @xmath0 , both in the charged - lepton sector and the neutrino sector . in other words , we would like the mixings deduced from the dynamics to be full or partial mixings of @xmath0 .",
    "there is no a priori guarantee that such a dynamics exists , but for many groups including @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the dynamics can indeed be obtained by imposing an additional @xmath66 symmetry , as we shall discuss in the second subsection below .    to implement this objective",
    "we must first figure out how to impose a residual symmetry in a dynamical theory . that will be discussed in the first subsection below .",
    "now the first question . with dynamics",
    "different mixings have different energies , so dynamics provides a mechanism to pick out the preferred inequivalent or partial mixing that has the lowest energy among them .",
    "if dynamics can pick out a preferred mixing ( or residual symmetries ) from a group @xmath0 , then in a similar way it might be able to pick out a preferred group @xmath0 from a larger group .",
    "this possibility is discussed in the third subsection below .",
    "a dynamical theory starts from a lagrangian invariant under s horizontal symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "mass matrices from which mixing is derived come from the yukawa interactions after symmetry is broken spontaneously .",
    "the higgs fields in the yukawa terms carry standard model ( sm ) quantum numbers and @xmath0 quantum numbers . for simplicity we shall assume them to be compound fields , made up of products of the usual sm higgs fields and _ valon _ fields carrying horizontal ( @xmath0 ) quantum numbers .",
    "the sm higgs fields are horizontal singlets , and the horizontal valon fields are sm singlets .",
    "this allows us to consider horizontal symmetry separately from the known sm symmetries .",
    "the original lagrangian is invariant under @xmath0 , hence if we carry out a simultaneous @xmath0-transformation of the left - handed fermions , the right - handed fermions , and the valons , then every yukawa term remains unchanged .",
    "this is no longer true when the valons acquire expectation values , thereby breaking @xmath0 .",
    "however , if the valon expectation value is an invariant eigenvector of some @xmath67 , then the yukawa terms containing this valon would remain invariant under @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath69 is a valon field in the charged - lepton sector such that @xmath70 , then @xmath15 is a residual symmetry of the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath71 is a valon field in the neutrino sector such that @xmath72 , then @xmath28 is a residual symmetry of the neutrino mass matrices @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if this @xmath73 is the same for all three @xmath37 , then the mixing computed from it is a full mixing .",
    "if it is different for different @xmath37 , then the mixing computed from it is a partial mixing . in that case",
    "full mixing is obtained by taking @xmath74 , the only common invariant vector of all the @xmath28 s .    in order to have enough tunable parameters to fit the masses",
    ", the original lagrangian usually contains valons belonging to all the irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "the condition above that expectation values are invariant eigenvectors must be true in all irreducible representations . in case",
    "such an invariant eigenvector does not exist in some representation , then the expectation value should be taken to be zero because a zero vector is always an invariant vector .",
    "expectation values are taken from the stationary points of a valon potential . according to the last subsection , in order for the potential to produce only full and partial mixings of @xmath0 , these points have to be invariant eigenvectors in every irreducible representation .",
    "there are four irreducible representations in @xmath2 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the expectation values in each of the one - dimensional irreducible representations is either zero or not zero . in either case",
    "it is easy to write down a potential that produces the result .",
    "thus , assuming the potentials of different irreducible representations do not interact , the difficult ones are those involving multi - dimensional representations such as @xmath76 .",
    "for 3 , the solution must be either ( 0,0,0 ) , or ( 1,0,0 ) which is the invariant eigenvector of @xmath77 , or @xmath78 which is the invariant eigenvector of @xmath49 , or ( 1,1,1 ) which is the invariant eigenvector of @xmath40 , or @xmath79 which is the invariant eigenvector of @xmath50 , or one of their equivalents .",
    "both @xmath51 and @xmath2 are capable of producing tbm , so is the horizontal symmetry of leptons @xmath3 , @xmath2 , or something else ?",
    "since both of them are subgroups of @xmath82 , one might hope to use the dynamics of @xmath82 to see which of these finite subgroups is @xmath82 going to break down to , thereby picking out the preferred horizontal symmetry for leptons .",
    "unfortunately , it is known @xcite that no matter what the dynamics is , as long as the valons have an @xmath82 spin less than 3 , neither @xmath3 nor @xmath2 symmetry can be retained after the breakdown",
    ". we want valons to have spins less or equal to 2 because they couple to two fermions , and being a triplet each fermion can have a horizontal spin of at most 1 .",
    "however , a generic @xmath81 valon potential can fulfill this mission . depending on the relative strengths of coupling constants , it breaks into one of three possible phases , one of which carries an @xmath2 symmetry suitable for lepton mixing .",
    "no phase containing any other non - abelian symmetry such as @xmath3 exists .",
    "the other two phases produce block - diagonal and hierarchical mass matrices that are capable of describing mass hierarchy and cabibbo mixing of quarks @xcite .",
    "thus this higher symmetry @xmath81 not only picks out @xmath2 over @xmath3 , it also serves as an approximate common symmetry for quarks and leptons at some high energy scale .",
