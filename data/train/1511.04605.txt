    "a big part of the particle data group @xcite contains a list of strongly interacting and short - living resonances(@xmath2 s ) , whose properties and decay channels were determined via many experimental collaborations in the last decades .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) contains only quarks and gluons and is based on the invariance under local color transformations , denoted as @xmath3 there are 6 types ( flavors ) of quarks : the quarks @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 are light with @xmath7-@xmath8 mev@xmath9-@xmath10 mev@xmath11 and @xmath12 mev , while the quarks @xmath13 are heavy with @xmath14 gev , @xmath15 @xmath16 gev , and @xmath17 gev ( mass values from @xcite ) .",
    "each quark flavor carries a color : reed , green , or blue . moreover , there are 8 gluons .",
    "each gluon appears as a color - anticolor state , such as red - antigreen .",
    "there is no colorless white gluon , explaining why there are only 8 of them .",
    "qcd could not be analytically solved in its low - energy domain because perturbation theory does not apply : this is due to the fact that the running coupling constant increases for decreasing energy .",
    "a related property is confinement : only ` white ' states , i.e. states which are invariant under local @xmath18 transformations , are realized in nature .",
    "colored objects , such as quarks and gluons ( but also diquarks ) , are not states which hit our detectors .    which are then the asymptotic states of qcd ?",
    "they are called hadrons ( hadrons means ` thick ' in ancient greek ) .",
    "two types of hadrons exist : mesons and baryons . for a proper definition of them ,",
    "we need to introduce the baryon number : each quark , independently of its flavor and color , carries a baryon number @xmath19 , while each gluon has a vanishing baryon number , @xmath20 .",
    "then the following general definitions apply :    _ mesons _ are white states ( i.e. invariant under color transformations ) which have a vanishing total baryon number .",
    "quark - antiquark states of the type @xmath21 , such as pions , kaons , etc . , are mesons @xcite .",
    "in fact : @xmath22 .",
    "they are regarded as _",
    "mesons , but they are _ not _ the only possibility @xcite .",
    "glueballs are mesonic states made solely of ( two or more ) gluons and are denoted as @xmath23 they are a long - standing but not yet fulfilled promise of qcd .",
    "glueballs are mesons because their baryon number is obviously zero , since each gluon is such .",
    "in addition , there are also mesonic tetraquark states made out of a diquark and an antidiquark , @xmath24 , or mesonic molecular states @xmath25 hybrids are also outstanding candidates @xcite : they are made of a quark - antiquark couple plus one ( or more ) gluon(s ) , @xmath26 in general , each state made of @xmath27 quarks , @xmath27 antiquarks , and @xmath28 gluons has total baryon number equal to zero and is in principle a meson . yet , while quark - antiquark states were measured in countless experiments , only very recently it was possible to confirm the existence of mesons beyond the quark - antiquark picture ( four - quark states , either in the tetraquark or molecular - like picture and/or admixtures of them ) , see for instance @xcite . for what concerns glueballs , some candidates exist ( especially for the lightest scalar glueball ) , but the final verification of their existence has still to come .    _",

    "3 we turn our attention to the construction of an effective hadronic model of qcd , the so - called extended linear sigma model ( elsm ) . we present its building blocks in detail since the considerations leading to it are quite general and are based solely on symmetry .",
    "a primary element of the eslm is the dilaton field , which is naturally linked to the scalar glueball .",

    "the decays and the assignment of the scalar glueball are presented ( the resonance @xmath34 is the most prominent candidate ) .",
    "then , the branching ratios of a not - yet discovered pseudoscalar glueball are calculated . in sec .",
    "5 we move to four - quark objects .",
    "we first study the light scalar sector , where the resonances @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 are most probably not @xmath39 states ; then we briefly discuss the status of @xmath0 and @xmath1 states in the region between @xmath40-@xmath41 gev , where recent experimental discoveries have nicely shown the existence of mesons which go beyond the quark - antiquark picture . finally , in  sec .",
    "6 we present our conclusions .",

    "the gluonic self - interactions are a fundamental property of nonabelian theories , which is believed to be one of the reasons for the emergence of glueballs .    in nature ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 however , depending on the problem , one can consider different values for @xmath33 and @xmath55 this is why it is useful to have general expressions .",
    "we now list the symmetries of @xmath56 as well as their spontaneous and explicit breakings :    \\(i ) _ local _ color symmetry @xmath48 .",

    "these two cases are those which are commonly used in practice .    finally , we recall also that there is a subgroup of @xmath85 denoted as the center @xmath86 , whose @xmath87 elements are given by : @xmath88 each @xmath89 corresponds to a proper choice of the parameters @xmath90 ( the case @xmath91 corresponds to the simple case @xmath92 the other elements to more complicated choices ) .",
    "we now turn back to the previously listed symmetries of qcd , which we re - discuss in more detail .",
    "\\(i ) _ local color symmetry _ @xmath93    the yang - mills fields @xmath94 is a @xmath95 matrix , @xmath96 , while the quark fields are vectors in color space ( @xmath97 @xmath50 ) . under @xmath98",

    "then , although hadronic fields are invariant under color transformations , the parameters have special scaling behaviors as function of @xmath102 one can then easily recognize which parameters are dominant in the large-@xmath33 limit , see the more detailed discussion later on .    at nonzero temperature @xmath103",
    ", the center transformation plays an important role .",
    "namely , one considers color transformations @xmath104 according to which @xmath105 and @xmath106 the @xmath107 action at temperature @xmath103 is invariant under this transformation ( often called center transformation , but care is needed , since it is a peculiar non - periodic transformation linking two different elements of the center ) .",
    "the periodicity of the ym fields is still fulfilled ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "the center symmetry is spontaneously broken in the ym vacuum at high temperature : the expectation value of the polyakov loop is the corresponding order parameter , which is nonzero at high @xmath103 but is zero at low @xmath110 the nonzero vacuum s expectation value ( v.e.v . ) of the polyakov loop signalizes the deconfinement of gluons .",
    "the center transformation is not a symmetry of the whole @xmath42 at nonzero @xmath103 ( i.e. , when quarks are included ) .",
    "namely , the necessary antisymmetric condition @xmath111 is not fulfilled for the transformed fields , @xmath112 , for which @xmath113 thus , center symmetry is explicitly broken by the quark fields .",
    "\\(ii ) _ dilatation symmetry and trace anomaly _    in the so - called chiral limit",

    "the corresponding conserved ( noether ) current is : @xmath120 where the energy - momentum @xmath121 tensor of the ym - lagrangian is given by @xmath122 quantum fluctuations of gluons break dilatation symmetry @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath123 becomes an energy - dependent running coupling @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the energy scale at which the coupling is probed ( for instance , in scattering processes , it is proportional to the energy in the center of mass ) : @xmath126 then , the following equation arises : @xmath127 where it is visible that @xmath128 as soon as @xmath129 : dilatation symmetry is _ explicitly _ broken . the quantity @xmath130 is the so - called @xmath131-function of the ym theory .",
    "indeed , if @xmath132 were constant ( @xmath133 ) , then @xmath134 but this is not the case .",
    "namely , already the one - loop level , one has:@xmath135 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 41 ] ) is : @xmath136 the fact that @xmath137 explains asymptotic freedom : the coupling @xmath138 becomes smaller for increasing @xmath125 ( nobel 2004 ) . on the other side , for small @xmath125 , the coupling @xmath138 increases .",
    "a ( not yet analytically proven ) consequence is ` confinement ' : gluons ( and quarks ) are confined in white hadronic states .",

    "( [ gmu ] ) scales as follows in the large-@xmath33 limit : @xmath141 this is the starting point of the study of the large-@xmath33 limit that we will describe later on .",
    "obviously , perturbation theory breaks down when the coupling becomes large .",
    "i t does not mean that @xmath142 becomes infinite , but it means that at the energy scale @xmath143 the ym theory ( and so whole qcd ) becomes strongly coupled .",
    "@xmath144 can not be obtained theoretically because the value @xmath145 at a certain given @xmath146 ( as for instance the grand unification energy scale @xmath147 gev ) is a priori unknown .",
    "however , the discussion shows a central point : a dimension has emerged !",
    "this is the so - called ` dimensional transmutation ' .",
    "numerically , it turns out that @xmath148 mev : this number affects all hadronic processes .",
    "a _ purely nonperturbative _ consequence of the scale anomaly is the emergence of a gluon condensate .",
    "namely , the vacuum s expectation value of the trace anomaly does not vanish ( for @xmath53):@xmath149 where @xmath150 ( the numerical results were obtained via lattice and sum rules calculations , see ref . @xcite and refs .",

    "indeed , the quantity @xmath151 can be also expressed as ( in the coulomb gauge)@xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the electric and magnetic color fields , respectively @xcite .",
    "perturbation theory shows that at each order @xmath155 thus @xmath156 should vanish accordingly .",
    "however , the existence of nonperturbative solutions such as instantons shows that this perturbative prediction does _ not _ hold and a nonzero gluon condensate is one of the main features of yang - mills theory .    as a last step , we add quarks and consider whole qcd . by taking into account that they have dimension @xmath157 they transform as @xmath158 in the chiral limit , the discussion is similar upon modifying eq .",

    "the breaking of scale invariance is a very important and deep phenomenon of qcd .",
    "an effective description of qcd should contain this feature .",

    "@xmath182    spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is on of the central properties of the hadronic world .",

    "in particular , it means that the axial charges@xmath195 do not annihilate the vacuum : @xmath196 then , according to the goldstone theorem , the pions emerge as ( quasi-)massless goldstone bosons .",

    "these are the goldstone bosons : pions , kaons , and the @xmath180-meson for @xmath200    \\(vi ) _ explicit symmetry breaking due to nonzero quark masses _",
    "the qcd mass term @xmath201 breaks explicitly many of the aforementioned symmetries .    being quark masses dimensional , the divergence of the dilatation current acquires an additional term : @xmath202    the symmetry under @xmath189 is still valid only if @xmath203 but , as soon as mass differences are present , the divergences of the vector currents @xmath204 are in general nonvanishing : @xmath205   q\\neq0\\text { , } % \\ ] ] with @xmath206 the symmetry @xmath184 corresponds to @xmath207 , therefore it is always valid independently on the masses ( as it must , being the conservation of the baryon number ) . in low - energy qcd it is common to set @xmath208 therefore isospin symmetry @xmath209 still holds .",
    "the symmetry under @xmath210 is broken as soon as @xmath211 in fact , the currents @xmath212 acquire the divergences@xmath213 the small but nonzero quark masses are responsible of the fact that the pions are not exactly goldstone bosons and therefore are not exactly massless .",
    "for the case @xmath207 there are two terms , one from the axial anomaly and one arising from the nonzero values of masses:@xmath214    for @xmath215 , the explicit breaking through quark masses is small , @xmath216 for @xmath217 the mass of @xmath6 is about @xmath218 mev and is thus of the same order of @xmath219 in turn , the explicit breaking induced by the @xmath6 quark is in general non - negligible .",
    "the other quark flavors ( @xmath13 ) are heavy : the breaking of symmetry due to their masses is dominant .",
    "this is why one considers the light - quark sector and the heavy - quark sector separately .    as a last point",
    "we mention a result which is usually obtained in the framework of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , which connects ( v ) and ( vi ) . the spontaneous breaking of @xmath60 is also responsible for the generation of an effective ( or constituent ) quark mass . for @xmath215 : @xmath220 it is now evident that @xmath60 is not a symmetry any longer , since @xmath221 effective quarks are quasi - particles which emerge when bare quarks are dressed by gluon clouds .",
    "notice that analogous results hold also when more advanced approaches are used to study the quark propagator , see for instance the dyson - schwinger study of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon takes place also for gluons , although the discussion is much more subtle because of gauge invariance .",
    "nevertheless , gluons dressed by gluonic fluctuations also develop an effective mass of about @xmath222-@xmath223 mev @xcite .",
    "quarks and gluons are not the physical states that we measure . they are confined into hadrons , i.e. mesons ( integer spin ) and baryons ( semi - integer spin ) .    a _ conventional meson _ is a meson constructed out of a quark and an antiquark .",
    "although it represents only one of ( actually infinitely many ) possibilities to build a meson , the vast majority of mesons of the pdg can be correctly interpreted as belonging to a quark - antiquark multiple @xcite ( see also the results of the quark model @xcite ) .",

    "many other mesonic states are expected to exist , most notably glueballs , which emerge as bound states of gluons .",
    "it is interesting to notice that quantum numbers such as @xmath248 @xmath249 @xmath250 _ can not _ be obtained in a quark - antiquark system , but is possible for unconventional mesonic states .",
    "the experimental discovery of mesons with these _ _  exotic quantum numbers _ _ naturally points to a non - quarkonium inner structure .",
    "indeed , glueballs ( but also other non - conventional configurations ) can produce exotic quantum numbers .      the bare coupling constant @xmath123 of the qcd lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lqcd ] ) becomes , upon renormalization , a running coupling constant , which we rewrite as:@xmath251 theoretically , it is very advantageous to study the limit in which @xmath33 is large , since many simplifications take place .",
    "a consistent way to take the large-@xmath33 limit is to postulate that @xmath252 out of which it follows that @xmath253 the following properties of hadrons hold ( see e.g. refs @xcite ) :    * the masses of quark - antiquark states and glueballs are constant for @xmath254 : @xmath255 * the interaction between @xmath27 quark - antiquark states @xmath256 scales as @xmath257 this implies that the amplitude for a @xmath27-meson scattering process becomes smaller and smaller for increasing @xmath33 .",

    "the interaction amplitude between @xmath27 quarkonia and @xmath28 glueballs behaves as @xmath263 thus the mixing ( @xmath264 ) scales as @xmath265 then , also the glueball - quarkonium mixing is suppressed for @xmath266 . * four - quark states ( both as molecular objects and diquark - antidiquark objects ) .",

    "even if not relevant in this work , we recall that baryons are made of @xmath33 quarks for an arbitrary @xmath102 as a consequence @xmath267    indeed , the large-@xmath33 limit is a firm theoretical method which explains why the quark model works .",
    "in fact , a decay channel for a certain meson causes quantum fluctuations : the propagator of the meson is dressed by loops of other mesons .",
    "for instance , the state @xmath268 decays into @xmath269 thus the @xmath239-meson is dressed by loops of pions . in the end , one has schematically that the wave function of the @xmath239-meson is given by:@xmath270 where the full expression of @xmath271 is given in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .",
    "being @xmath272 and @xmath273 we understand why the quark - antiquark configuration dominates .",
    "dots refer to further contributions which are even more suppressed .    yet , for @xmath53 there are some mesons for which the meson - meson component dominates .",
    "these are for instance , the light scalar mesons that we will study in sec .",
    "qcd can not be solved analytically . therefore , the use of effective approaches both in the vacuum and at finite temperature and densities represents a very useful tool toward the understanding of qcd .",
    "the question is the following : starting from the qcd lagrangian @xmath274 in terms of quarks and gluons , how should one construct the effective lagrangian @xmath275 in terms of hadronic d.o.f . ?",
    "symbolically : @xmath276 there is no general accepted procedure : the hadronic lagrangian @xmath277 valid up to an energy of about @xmath278 gev can not be analytically obtained out of @xmath56 .",

    "the only possibility is to have four - quark states such as @xmath755 for @xmath756 and @xmath757 for @xmath758 ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    although the exact configuration is not known , the evidence for a non - conventional mesonic substructure is compelling .",
    "in addition , very recently the neutral member of the multiplet @xmath759 was found by bes @xcite , which corresponds naturally to @xmath760    in conclusion , we mention that there are other mesonic states which are not yet understood .",
    "an example is the strange - charmed scalar state @xmath761 , which is too light to be a @xmath762 quarkonium .",
    "it can be a four - quark or -even more probable- a dynamically generated state .",
    "in these lectures we have discussed one of the main topic of modern qcd : the existence and the properties of non - conventional mesons , i.e. mesons which are not quark - antiquark objects .",
    "glueballs , i.e. bound state of gluons , are a firm prediction of models and lattice qcd but are still missing detection , even if some candidates exist . on the contrary ,",
    "evidence toward the existence of four - quark objects both at low - energy and in the charmonium region is mounting ( thanks to both experiment and theory ) .    for pedagogical purposes , we have first reviewed the symmetries of qcd .",
    "dilatation symmetry and its breaking is a central phenomenon of qcd since it delivers a fundamental energy scale on which all quantities will depend .",
    "another very relevant symmetry is chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking , which is responsible for the fact that chiral symmetry is hidden ( there are not degenerated chiral partners ) .",
    "mass differences arises and goldstone bosons ( most notably the pions ) emerge .",
    "another central theoretical tool of qcd is the large-@xmath33 limit , in which the number of color is artificially increased to large values . in this limit ,",
    "conventional quark - antiquark mesons as well as glueballs become stable .",
    "later on , we constructed a model of qcd , called the extended linear sigma model ( elsm ) , which embodies the mentioned properties : the presence of a dilaton / glueball field is a primary ingredient ; chiral symmetry and its breaking are realized by a mexican - hat potential ; scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons are the building blocks of its lagrangian .",
    "the agreement of the theoretical results with data is very good ( see table 6 and ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the elsm can be used to study glueballs .",
    "the scalar glueball is already there : a detailed study of it has shown that the resonance @xmath34 is predominantly gluonic .",
    "the pseudoscalar glueball has been also coupled to light mesons and its branching ratios are predictions that can be used in future searches of this particle .",
    "the very same idea can be extended to all other glueballs predicted by lattice qcd .",
    "the elsm offers a solid basis for the calculation of the decays of gluonic states in accordance with chiral and dilatation symmetries . in this context , the future panda experiment will be very useful because almost all glueball can be produced in proton - antiproton fusion processes .",
    "then , we have concentrated on four - quark objects .",
    "they can emerge as diquark - antidiquark states and/or as meson - meson bound states . in any case",
    ", we expect that quantum mesonic loops play an important role in the understanding of various tetraquark candidates . in the low - energy sector , the light scalar mesons are very broad and the use of quantum field theoretical models going beyond tree - level is compelling . in the charmonium sector , many of the newly discovered @xmath752 states are close to energy thresholds , thus also in this case loops are expected to be relevant . in any case , it must be stressed that the experimental discovery of charged @xmath1 states implies that non - quarkonium objects exist .    in conclusion",
    ", there is room for new discoveries in the field of non - conventional hadrons .",
    "the interchange of experimental activity and theoretical models and numerical simulations will be important to proceed in this fascinating field of high energy physics .",

    "<S> the vast majority of mesons can be understood as quark - antiquark states . yet , various other possibilities exists : glueballs ( bound - state of gluons ) , hybrids ( quark - antiquark plus gluon ) , and four - quark states ( either as diquark - antidiquark or molecular objects ) are expected . in particular , the existence of glueballs represents one of the first predictions of qcd , which relies on the nonabelian feature of its structure ; this is why the search for glueballs and their firm discovery would be so important , both for theoretical and experimental developments . at the same time , many new resonances ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 states ) were discovered experimentally , some of which can be well understood as four - quark objects . in this lecture , we review some basic aspects of qcd and show in a pedagogical way how to construct an effective hadronic model of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we then present the results for the decays of the scalar and the pseudoscalar glueballs within this approach and discuss the future applications to other glueball states . in conclusion </S>",
