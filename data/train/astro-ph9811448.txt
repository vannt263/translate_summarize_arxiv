    "the number of strongly lensed sources found in individual observational programs can be used to constrain the cosmological constant ( e.g. , turner 1990 ) . using statistics of optical lensing programs ,",
    "various studies have now derived upper limuts on the present day value of the cosmological constant ( kochanek 1996a ; chiba & yoshi 1997 ; cooray et al .",
    "as discussed in the literature , however , lensed source search programs at optical wavelengths can be affected by systematics arising from effects due to extinction and reddening ( e.g. , malhotra et al .",
    "1996 ) , and issues related to completeness ( kochanek 1991 ) .",
    "such effects , especially extinction for which there is no clear consensus , can not easily be quantified in cosmological studies with gravitational lensing statistics . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "neither of these effects are likely to affect the statistics ( see , falco et al .",
    "1998 ) , including completeness , when flux - limited systematic surveys are carried out . also , high resolution interferometers such as the vla and merlin allow detection of lensed sources with image separations much smaller than that allowed by ground - based optical telescopes .",
    "thus , statistics from lensed radio source surveys are generally preferred over the optical ones to obtain cosmological parameters",
    ".    recently , falco et al . (",
    "1998 ) studied the statistics of lensed radio sources in the jodrell bank - vla astrometric survey ( jvas ; browne et al .",
    "1997 ; patnaik et al .",
    "1992 ) sample of 2500 flat - spectrum sources brighter than 200 mjy at 5 ghz .",
    "they were able to derive a 2@xmath15 lower - limit on the mass density of the universe of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 at 1@xmath15 ) .",
    "recently , the number of strongly lensed radio sources has steadily increased with results from the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ) , which has observed @xmath0 6500 flat - spectrum sources during the first two sessions of its observations using the vla . the total number of currently confirmed lensed radio sources from these observations amount to six : b1608 + 656 ( myers et al .",
    "1995 ) , b2045 + 265 ( fassnacht et al .",
    "1998 ) , b1933 + 503 ( sykes et al .",
    "1998 ) , b0712 + 472 ( jackson et al .",
    "1998a ) , b1600 + 434 ( jackson et al . 1995 ) , b1127 + 385 ( koopmans et al .",
    "the class is a collaboration between groups at jodrell bank , caltech , dwingeloo and leiden , and is an extension to the previous jvas by observing flat - spectrum sources ( @xmath18 ) down to a flux density limit of 30 mjy at 5 ghz .    here",
    ", we calculate the expected number of lensed radio sources in the class sample of @xmath0 6500 sources for different cosmological parameters , and constrain these parameters by comparing the predictions with the observations . in sect .",
    "2 , we discuss our calculation and its inputs , including the redshift distribution for background radio sources and the luminosity distribution of foreground lenses . in sect .",
    "3 , we present our resulting constraints on cosmological parameters , and in particular on @xmath1 , as well as on the redshift distribution of the faint radio sources . in sect .",
    "4 , we discuss the potential effect of systematic errors in the predicted and observed rate of strong lensing . finally , in sect . 5 , we summarize and discuss future prospects for tighter constraints .",
    "we follow the conventions that the hubble constant , @xmath19 , is 100@xmath20  km  s@xmath21  mpc@xmath21 , the present normalized mean density of the universe @xmath22 is @xmath23 , and the present normalized cosmological constant @xmath3 is @xmath24 . in a flat universe , @xmath4 .",
    "we have simplified the notation by not including the subscript 0 usually taken to denote the present day values of these quantities .",
    "our present calculational method is quite similar to that of cooray et al .",
    "( 1998a ; hereafter cqm ) , in which we calculated the expected lensing rate in the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , as implied by various photometric redshift catalogs for hdf sources . a comparison between the observed number of lensed sources in the hdf and the predicted number , allowed us to calculate the present value of @xmath1 .",
    "we follow a procedure similar to cqm by first establishing the redshift distribution of the observed class sources , and then by using the standard lensing calculations to estimate the expected number of strongly lensed radio sources present in this sample .    in fig .  1",
    ", we show the flux density distribution of class sources . except for a handful of sources with flux densities",
    "greater than 200 mjy , most of the observed sources follow a distribution that sharply rises around 30 mjy .",
    "this is only an observational artifact due to the 30 mjy cutoff imposed on the initial source selection . since the source sample was selected based on previous green bank 5 ghz surveys ( e.g. , gregory et al .",
    "1996 ) and that we are now using the measured flux densities from class vla snapshot maps at 8.4 ghz , the presence of sources with flux densities less than 30 mjy at 8.4 ghz suggest that the current class sample includes a small number of non - flat spectrum radio sources ; the class definition with respect to flat spectrum sources is based on an upper frequency point at 5 ghz rather than 8.4 ghz .",
    "sources with flux densities less than 30 mjy are also expected given uncertainties in the green bank survey flux density measurements and the possibility for intrinsic flux density variation between green bank and class survey epochs .",
    "the total number of radio sources in the publicly available catalog of class sourcesnjj / glens / class.html ] during the first two sessions is 6528 .    as discussed in falco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , one of the main problems associated with lensed radio source statistics is the non - availability of redshifts for radio sources .",
    "however , it has also been shown by falco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and previously by kochanek ( 1996b ) , that the radio sources exhibit a strong correlation between their redshift and flux density distributions .",
    "thus , even though complete redshift surveys may not exist , it is still possible to construct with existing data a statistically accurate redshift distribution for a given radio flux density .",
    "this assumes that the correlation between redshift and flux density distribution remains to be valid at flux levels lower than observationally studied .",
    "since redshifts can not be determined exactly for individual sources , each of the assigned redshifts at a given flux density will have an uncertainty which can be accounted when calculating cosmological parameters .",
    "also , since the class radio source sample is substantially large , on average , the modeled redshift distribution can be expected to represent the true redshift distribution . since",
    "no new radio source redshift surveys have been published recently , we use the parameterization of the flux@xmath25redshift relation in falco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to calculate the probable redshifts of class sources . for each redshift",
    ", we also assign an uncertainty based on the error in the parameterization presented by falco et al .",
    "( 1998 ; see , their fig .",
    "since no redshift surveys exist for radio sources with flux densities less than @xmath0 200 mjy , we use the extrapolation of the flux@xmath25redshift distribution to estimate the redshifts of these sources .",
    "however , we assign a slightly higher uncertainty for these redshifts than expected from the simple extrapolation presented in falco et al .",
    "we assume that the model a in falco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is the mean redshift distribution , while models b and c , with an increase in uncertainty , represents our higher and lower redshift distributions , respectively . with redshift and flux density for each source , we calculate the radio luminosity , @xmath26 , and its uncertainty .",
    "we do not consider any errors in the flux density measurement as these are likely to be small compared to the ones associated with the lensing calculation .    in order to calculate the lensing rate for radio sources , we model the lensing galaxies as singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) and use the analytical filled - beam approximation ( e.g. , fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ) . at redshifts",
    "@xmath27 , the analytical filled - beam calculation in fukugita et al . (",
    "1992 ) agree to better than 2% with numerical calculations ( e.g. , fig .  1 in holz et al .",
    "1998 ) .    gravitational lensing statistics are affected by the so - called `` magnification bias '' ( kochanek 1991 ) in which the number of lensed sources in the sample can be different from an unlensed sample down to the same flux density level .",
    "thus , any calculation involving lensed source statistics should account for the magnification bias and associated systematic effects .",
    "the effect of this bias , whether to increase or decrease the number of lensed sources , depends on the slope of the number counts . the magnification bias is particularly pronounced in quasar lensing surveys ( maoz & rix 1993 ) , because the faint end of the quasar luminosity function rises steeply , increasing the number of lensed sources . in sect .",
    "2.2 , we discuss this effect for radio sources based on the flat - spectrum radio luminosity function .",
    "following cqm , if the probability for a source at redshift @xmath28 to be strongly lensed is @xmath29 , as calculated based on the filled - beam equation , we can write the number of lensed sources , @xmath30 , as ( see , also , maoz et al . 1992 ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the magnification bias for a radio source at redshift @xmath28 with luminosity @xmath26 , and @xmath33 is the selection function defined based on image separation , @xmath34 , and flux ratio , @xmath35 , between components of the strongly lensed sources . here",
    ", the sum is over each of the radio sources in our sample .",
    "the index @xmath36 represents each object ; hence , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the redshift , and the rest - frame luminosity of the @xmath36th source .    for simplicity ,",
    "following kochanek ( 1996b ) , we assume that the selection function is simply a uniform function in the range @xmath39 , such that all lensed sources in this range are recovered . for the sis model , the fraction of lensed sources in this range of image separations is 0.917 ( e.g. , kochanek 1996b ) .",
    "we have assumed that the image separation , @xmath34 , under the sis assumption for foreground galaxies is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath15 is the velocity dispersion of the foreground lensing galaxies , and that the characteristic velocity dispersion for a @xmath41 galaxy , @xmath42 , is 220 km s@xmath21 ( see , eq .",
    "22 in kochanek 1996b ) .",
    "given that the observations are carried out to a much lower flux density level than the flux density of the observed source , and that the candidate lensed sources are selected when flux ratios between strong components are @xmath43 10 ( browne et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is likely that the selection function is independent of the flux ratio between lensed images . for sis models , the fraction of lensed sources with image flux ratios @xmath43 10 is 0.9997 , and thus , for the purpose of this calculation we take @xmath33 to be a constant with numerical value of 0.916 .",
    "the bias , @xmath44 , can be calculated based on the radio luminosity function for background sources at redshift @xmath28 , @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the probability distribution of amplifications @xmath48 .",
    "the ghz radio luminosity function for flat - spectrum sources , and its evolution , is still not well determined observationally . for the purpose of the present paper ,",
    "we follow the work of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) , where luminosity functions are calculated for sources at 2.7 ghz .",
    "since we are dealing with a sample of flat spectrum sources , we can safely assume that the 1 to 10 ghz luminosity function is equivalent to that at 2.7 ghz .",
    "we use the pure luminosity - evolution model ( ple ) for flat - spectrum sources , which is motivated by optical quasar and x - ray agn luminosity functions ( e.g. , boyle et al .",

    "the magnification bias can be written as ( maoz & rix 1993 ) : @xmath67    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the magnification bias as a function of radio luminosity using the luminosity range for most of the sources in the class survey . for sources with luminosities such that @xmath68 , the magnification bias is simply determined by the slope @xmath55 and",
    "is numerically equivalent to @xmath0 3.04 .      the probability of strong lensing depends on the number density and typical mass of lensing galaxies . for singular isothermal spheres ,",

    "therefore , we do not attempt to calculate an upper limit to @xmath1 , hence a lower limit to @xmath3 in a flat universe , using current lensing statistics .    since the class survey is expected to observe a total of @xmath0 10000 sources , it is possibile that the current constraints on cosmological parameters may be improved . in order to investigate this possibility",
    ", we used the full catalog of @xmath0 10500 sources publicly available from the class collaboration , which includes sources that are planned to be observed , as well as the @xmath0 6500 sources in the current sample .",
    "the present constraints on @xmath1 do not vary greatly when the true number of lensed sources for the whole sample remains to be what is obtained based on the current observed lensing rate .",
    "if for some reason , the additional sample of @xmath0 3500 sources were to contain twice as more lensed sources than currently expected , then cosmological parameter estimates change to be consistent with a high @xmath3 .",
    "however , since this is not likely to be the case , unless the source selection process is heavily affected systematics , an increase in the source sample is not likely to improve the radio lensing constraints on cosmological parameters greatly .",
    "recent studies have suggested the existence of a scalar field as viable alternatives to the cosmological constant ( see , e.g. , caldwell , dave & steinhardt 1998 ) with an equation of state of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pressure and density of the scalar - field , respectively .",
    "then , as the universe expands @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the scale factor with @xmath121 . the vacuum energy or the cosmological constant corresponds to @xmath122 , while texture or tangled strings correspond to @xmath123 .",
    "we modified our lensing probability calculation to account for the scalar field , and recalculated the likelihoods using the same technique as above .",
    "we assume a flat universe , and take @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is the present day normalized energy density of th scalar - field component .",
    "we assume a prior in which @xmath10 is uniform between 0 and + 1 .",
    "our new constraints are summarized in fig .  5 on the @xmath9 plane .",
    "the 95% and 68% upper limits ( _ thick solid lines _ ) from gravitational lensing are labeled 95% gl and 68% gl respectively . the 95% confidence . upper limit on @xmath10 can be written as @xmath124 .",
    "in addition to lensing constraints , we also show the resulting constraints on @xmath10 and @xmath125 based on type ia supernovae at high redshifts ( 95% sn ) as recently studied by garnavich et al .",
    "( 1998 ; _ dot - dashed lines _ ) and constant age lines of the universe as a function of @xmath126 ( _ dotted lines _ ) . for a hubble constant , @xmath19 , of 65 @xmath84 10 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 ( riess et al . 1998 ) and a minimum age of the universe , @xmath127 , from globular clusters of @xmath128 gyr ( chaboyer et al .",
    "1996 ) , a conservative lower limit on @xmath126 is @xmath129 ( _ dashed line _ ) . for an age of the universe of @xmath0 15 @xmath84 2 gyr , @xmath130 0.90 to 1.15 .",
    "these three cosmological probes , type ia supernovae , age and lensed sources , qualitatively agree with each other when @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "these combined results rule out tangled strings with an equation of state of the form @xmath123 as the scalar - field component .",
    "as studied by turner & white ( 1997 ) , the combined large scale structure , age and supernovae data are consistent with @xmath133 when @xmath134 to 0.4 .",
    "the constraints on @xmath2 primarily comes from the clustered mass - density in galaxy clusters based on observed baryonic mass combined with a nucleosynthesis determined baryonic mass density of the universe , @xmath135 ( e.g. , burles & tytler 1997 ) , resulting in @xmath136 ( evrard 1997 ) . in fig .  5",
    ", we have outlined a conservative lower limit on the known matter content considering these and similar measurements .",
    "even with known matter considered , there is still a large region left on the @xmath9 plane to form a flat universe allowing various possibilities for the physical nature of the scalar - field component . in future ,",
    "constraints on the equation of state of the unknown scalar - field component is likely to be improved based on cmb anisotropy and large scale structure data combined with standard cosmological probes such as high redshift supernovae and gravitational lensing statistics ( see , hu et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "since redshifts for radio sources with flux densities less than 150 mjy are not accurately known , we can use the observed lensing rate with an assumed cosmological model to constrain the redshift distribution of background sources .",
    "this approach is very similar to the one used by holz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to constrain the redshift distribution of gamma - ray burst sources detected by batse based on lensing statistics .",
    "for the purpose of this calculation , we vary the redshifts of the background sources with flux densities less than 150 mjy , while keeping the rest fixed at the appropriate redshifts as determined earlier .",
    "since we are only interested in an upper limit to the average redshift of faint radio sources , we calculate lensing probabilities as a function of @xmath13 , the _ effective _ average redshift , under the assumption that all sources are at this redshift .",
    "this methodology parameterizes our ignorance of the faint radio source redshift distribution ( see , holz et al .",
    "1998 for a discussion ) .",
    "however , this assumption is incorrect given that at a given flux density level , radio sources have a rather broad distribution in redshift .",
    "nevertheless , our approach is to suggest a possible upper limit to the mean redshift of this distribution , assuming that the distribution is not shaped such that more sources are at higher redshifts than suggested by the mean .",
    "since the lensing rate is highly nonlinear in redshift , a slowly decreasing distribution with increasing redshift can increase the lensing rate faster than the assumed average value . in general",
    ", our upper limit underestimates the true average redshift .    in table  5 , we tabulate the 68% confidence upper limit on the redshift of the subsample of sources with flux densities less than 150 mjy and assuming that the total number of lensed sources in the current class sample is either 6 or 10 .",
    "this upper limit on the redshift is again a function of @xmath1 .",
    "if there are 6 lensed sources in the present class sample , then @xmath137 ( 68% c.l . ) . since the observed redshift distribution of known lensed sources in the class sample are between 1.3 and 1.6 ( see , table 1 in jackson et al .",
    "1998b ) , cosmological models where @xmath3 is greater than 0.8 in a flat universe are disfavored .",
    "ccc @xmath1 & @xmath115 & @xmath138 + -1.0 & 0.57 & 0.84 + -0.4 & 1.05 & 1.39 + 0.0 & 1.44 & 1.78 + 0.4 & 1.83 & 2.24 + 1.0 & 2.37 & 2.88 +",
    "as presented in table  4 , a major uncertainty comes from the unknown redshift distribution of faint radio sources with flux densities less than 150 mjy .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the current observational data on radio sources would be useful to constrain the cosmological parameters based on class results , unless the redshift distribution for its sources is properly established .",
    "since the redshift and flux density distributions for radio sources are strongly correlated , it is not necessary that redshifts for all @xmath0 6500 sources be known .",
    "however , redshifts for a representative subsample of class sources are much needed .",
    "the determination of redshifts would involve the process of optical identifications and spectroscopic observations ; a task that would take a considerable amount of telescope time and man power to complete .",
    "however , as a result of this study , where we have shown the strong variation in cosmological parameters with a change in redshift distribution , it is necessary that the true redshift distribution be used to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "we strongly recommend that a subsample of sources be defined from the class catalog and be followed up optically to obtain redshifts .",
    "the determination of redshifts would also aid in the estimation of a reliable luminosity function for faint radio sources , which can be used to improve the calculation associated with the magnification bias .",
    "in addition to redshift distribution , the selection function for lensed radio source discovery process is badly needed .",
    "for the present calculation , we have assumed that all lensed sources with image separations between 0.3 and 6 arcsecs are recovered .",
    "however , the selection function is likely to be complicated ; it is much easier to recognize a four - image lensed source than a doubly - imaged lensed source .",
    "an initial study of such biases as applied to the jvas survey could be found in king & browne ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , since radio lens statistics are much cleaner than the optical ones , we do not expect biases and selection effects to make a big difference in present constraints on the cosmological parameters , unless the selection function is heavily affected by such effects .",
    "nevertheless , king & browne ( 1996 ) found that the jvas survey contains at least a factor of 2 less doubly imaged sources than expected from sis and external shear models .",
    "such a result , if also confirmed for class survey , suggests the possibility that a large number of doubly - imaged sources has been missed by the search process or that a bias not yet understood affects the observations .",
    "apart from background sources , an understanding of the foreground lenses is clearly needed .",
    "use of different @xmath72 values by neglecting certain galaxy populations can lead to rather diverse results , as was recently demonstrated by chiba & yoshi ( 1998 ) .",
    "current deep and wide - area redshift surveys are likely to increase our knowledge on the foreground lenses and their composition over the next few years . a consistent description of foreground lenses are also needed for the comparative purposes between optical and radio lensed source sample studies . currently , however , this task is complicated by individual studies suggesting different values for the @xmath72 parameter , resulting from different luminosity functions used to describe foreground lenses .",
    "with increasing knowledge on the foreground lenses , an ideal approach would be to use the luminosity function determined from known lensing galaxies ( e.g. , kochanek et al . 1998 ) , including the variation of their number density with redshift .",
    "using flux density distribution for a sample of @xmath0 6500 radio sources observed during the first two sessions of the cosmic lens all sky survey , and the observed number of strongly lensed sources within this sample , we have constrained the cosmological parameters .",
    "we have considered the possibility that there are total of six ( as observed ) , four or ten lensed sources within this sample to investigate the changes in our constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we find that the expected number of lensed sources is primarily a function of @xmath1 .",
    "a comparison of the predicted number of lensed sources with the observed number allows us to constrain its current value .",
    "based on the current determinations of the redshift distribution for radio sources , our 95% confidence lower limit on @xmath1 is between -0.58 to -0.23 depending on the assumed model for the redshift distribution of faint radio sources .",
    "for a flat universe with @xmath4 , then , @xmath113 to 0.79 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "if there are ten strongly lensed sources , the 95% confidence lower limit on @xmath3 is between -0.90 and -0.52 .",
    "these limits are in agreement with previous limits based on gravitational lensing ( kochanek 1996a , 1996b ; falco et al .",
    "1998 ) , and are not in conflict with estimates based on high redshift supernovae ( viz . , @xmath139 [ riess et al . 1998 ] ) .",
    "as has been performed recently in various papers , combining @xmath1 results from high redshift supernovae measurements with @xmath140 results from cmb power spectrum analysis constrains @xmath2 and @xmath3 separately , with much higher accuracy than the individual experiments alone .",
    "we note that gravitational lensing constraints on @xmath1 should also be considered in such an analysis , to obtain a consistent picture on the present cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition to the cosmological constant , we have also studied the possibility of a scalar field responsible for the additional energy density of the universe .",
    "we have shown our constraints on the @xmath9 plane .",
    "if there are six strongly lensed sources in the present class sample , gravitational lensing statistics allow us to rule out the region with @xmath12 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "we study the region allowed using combined constraints from gravitational lensing statistics , high redshift type ia supernovae distances and limits on the age of the universe from globular clusters .",
    "we have also considered the current estimates on the known matter content of the universe .",
    "since we have assumed a redshift distribution for radio sources to constrain cosmological models , alternatively , we can constrain the redshift distribution of faint radio sources based on the observed gravitational lensing rate and an assumed cosmological model .",
    "if there are six strongly lensed sources , the 68% confidence upper limit on the redshift distribution of flat - spectrum radio sources with flux densities less than 150 mjy at 8.4 ghz is @xmath141 .    in order to obtain a much tighter estimate on @xmath1 , it is essential that the redshift distribution for radio sources at the faint flux density levels be observationally determined .",
    "also , estimates of the flat - spectrum radio luminosity function and the selection function in lensed source discovery process are needed to complete the story .",
