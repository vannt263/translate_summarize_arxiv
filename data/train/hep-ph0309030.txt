    "it is believed today that a new state of matter has been formed in relativistic nuclear collisions at bnl - rhic and at cern - sps , and perhaps even in 1800 gev @xmath1 elementary interactions .",
    "the question of considerable interest is if this is the hot quark matter ( quark  gluon plasma , qgp ) state of matter .",
    "the paradigm of qgp originates in the quantum many body theory of quark matter @xcite , which lead on to the formal recognition within the framework of asymptotically free quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) that at a very high temperature perturbative quark matter state must exist @xcite .    further reasoning based on a study of the ` boiling state ' of dense hadron gas within the scheme of hagedorn s statistical bootstrap of hadronic matter",
    "has lead from a different direction to the consideration of the transition to a hadron substructure phase @xcite .",
    "the present day lattice - qcd numerical simulations allows to evaluate more rigorously the expected properties of a equilibrium state of qgp , as we today call hot quark matter @xcite .",
    "qgp is the equilibrium state of matter at high temperature and/or density .",
    "the question is if , in the short time such conditions are available in laboratory experiments , this new state of matter can be created .",
    "there is no valid first principles answer available today and we must address this issue experimentally .",
    "it is obviously very hard to probe experimentally the qgp phase which exists a very short time .",
    "it is not widely accepted how a reaction involving formation of the deconfined state can be distinguished decisively from one involving reactions between individual confined hadrons .",
    "we observe in the final state of a high energy interaction reaction , irrespective if , or not , deconfinement has been achieved , a very large number of hadronic particles .",
    "the phenomenon of @xmath2 and jet quenching probes the early stage of the deconfined phase .",
    "its relation to deconfinement has been argued away in terms of effects of matter density and changes in primary production reaction mechanisms .",
    "plasma photon radiation is buried in the background of final state photons from , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath3 .",
    "dileptons ( that is in fact virtual photons ) suffer from large experimental uncertainties , and a final state background which depends of new physics as well ( hadron properties at finite temperature and density ) .",
    "perhaps the most promising path to a convincing evidence for the formation of the deconfined state in relativistic heavy ion collisions is the precision study of the production of soft hadrons .",
    "insights into the nature of the hot hadronic matter fireball are gained from interpretation of an array of particle yields and spectra .",
    "a precise model description allows to evaluate the global properties such as energy , entropy , strangeness content of all particles produced .",
    "this opens up to further investigation the properties of the matter state that has hadronized .",
    "supporting this approach is the study of several reaction systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , comparison of @xmath4 with @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 reactions . in this case",
    ", the change of particle yield when this contradicts the hadron rescattering model expectations is evidence of new physics .",
    "normally one encounters in an @xmath4 experiment enhancement of expected yield comparing to @xmath5 reactions .",
    "more recently , some have argued that the @xmath4 yield of ( strange ) hadrons is ` normal ' and that the effect is due to a ` suppressed ' @xmath5 base yield .",
    "this argument does not change the fact that in any case the @xmath4 yield does not arise from a sequence of @xmath5 reactions .",
    "the model we employ arises from the observation that hadron production is well described in a very large range of yields solely by evaluating the phase space size .",
    "originally proposed by fermi in order to describe multiparticle production in high energy cosmic ray interactions @xcite , in the past 40 year the fermi model ( _ i.e. _ , statistical hadronization ) has been tried successfully in many particle production environments , beginning with @xmath7@xmath7 collisions at various energies , and branching out to heavy ion as well as the elementary non - hadronic @xmath8 reactions .",
    "we begin , in section [ stathad ] , with a discussion of the role hadronic resonances play in testing the principles of statistical hadronization .",
    "we survey , in subsection [ res ] , the latest experimental hadronic resonance production results from rhic .",
    "we next describe how particle yields and ratios can be obtained .",
    "we introduce , in subsection [ fuga ] , the ideas of hadrochemistry and show , in subsection [ ssratios ] , how particle ratios determine hadronization parameters .",
    "we turn to the study of phase space densities in subsection [ anund ] .",
    "we show that the entropy rich qgp phase hadronizes into chemical non - equilibrium pion gas that can absorb the entropy excess . for a more detailed discussion",
    "we refer to our earlier reviews @xcite .    we introduce strangeness as signature of deconfined qgp phase in section [ sqgp ] .",
    "we discuss the interest in strangeness both from experimental and theoretical perspective in subsection [ thr ] .",
    "we introduce , in subsection [ 2step ] , the two step strange hadron production process , in which the hadronization benefits from ample supply of strangeness already produced .",
    "this is the origin of multi strange hadron enhancement .",
    "we show , in subsection [ mist ] , that the observed enhancement effect is genuine . in subsection",
    "[ scool ] , we discuss how the outward collective flow of matter influences the resulting fireball hadronization conditions and assists the sudden hadronization .",
    "section [ hadsr ] presents our findings about the hadronization at sps and at rhic .",
    "we define first the method of analysis in subsection [ method ] and follow this through with a discussion of rhic fits in subsection [ rhican ] .",
    "we then address the energy dependence of the statistical parameters characterizing the fireball source in subsection [ statpar ] .",
    "an interesting result that follows is about the behavior of energy per baryon stopping .",
    "our primary interest is the strangeness yield which we address in subsection [ stranges ] .",
    "our study leads directly to the final question , is there a energy threshold for the onset of quark  gluon plasma formation , which we address in section  [ compare ] . on important element of our study is to identify observables which are independent of the different baryon densities reached .",
    "we look from this perspective at the kaon to pion ratio discontinuity reported at low end of sps energy range .",
    "we show that this is a result of baryon density effect in subsection [ kpi ] . in subsection [ lhc ]",
    "we discuss a mechanism of kaon to pion ratio enhancement arising from fast transverse expansion , and present the maximum enhancement expected at lhc . a brief evaluation of our findings and their importance follows in subsection [ final ] .",
    "the initial test of statistical hadronization approach to particle production is that within a particle ` family ' , particle yields with same valance quark content are in relation to each other thermally equilibrated .",
    "thus the relative yield of , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is controlled only by the particle masses @xmath11 , statistical weights ( degeneracy ) @xmath12 and the hadronization temperature @xmath13 . in the boltzmann limit",
    "one has ( star denotes the resonance ) : @xmath14 validity of this relation implies insensitivity of the quantum matrix element governing the coalescence - fragmentation production of particles to intrinsic structure ( parity , spin , isospin ) , and particle mass .",
    "the measurement of the relative yield of hadron resonances is a sensitive test of the statistical hadronization hypothesis .",
    "the experimental ratio  @xcite : @xmath15 has been measured , left for most central collisions with @xmath16gev , and right for most central 200 gev reactions , in rhic-130 , and rhic-200 runs respectively ( 65 + 65 gev and 100 + 100 gev per nucleon head on collisions of two nuclear beams ) .",
    "the rhic result naturally arises from the ratio allowing for resonance decays within the statistical hadronization model for the temperature @xmath17 mev .",
    "this is the favored solution of a fit which allows for chemical non - equilibrium @xcite , see subsection [ rhican ] .",
    "however , the yield : @xmath18 recorded in the rhic-130 and rhic-200 runs @xcite , is two times smaller compared to statistical hadronization expectation .",
    "statistical hadronization at higher temperature than @xmath19 mev does not resolve this discrepancy , but adds to it a @xmath20 suppression .",
    "these two ratios , seen together , are , at first , difficult to understand .",
    "let us first note that an apparent production suppression may actually be detectability suppression .",
    "namely , should the decay products of resonances rescatter on other particles after formation , their energies and momenta will change .",
    "hence , not all produced resonances can be , in general , reconstructed from the decay products energies @xmath21 and momenta @xmath22 by testing for the invariant mass : @xmath23 the rescattering effect depletes more strongly the yields of shorter lived states . these decay",
    "sooner and are thus more within the dense matter system .",
    "if resonance yield is as predicted by statistical hadronization , the decay life span is expected to be larger then the hadronization time , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath24 this assures that most @xmath25 decay after thermal freeze - out of decay products ( @xmath26 ) in free space . on the other hand , we recall that the lifespan of @xmath27 is about 2.3 times longer than that of @xmath25 .",
    "this means that contrary to the expectation derived from rescattering effect , it is the longer lived @xmath27 state for which we find the signature to be significantly depleted as compared to what could be maximally seen given the statistical hadronization yield .",
    "a natural explanation of the @xmath27 signature suppression is in matter modification of the free space @xmath28 mev decay width @xcite .",
    "this width corresponds to @xmath29fm .",
    "thus for sudden hadronization , implied by the observed yield of @xmath25 , @xmath27 decay should occur well outside the reaction domain",
    ". however , if in medium width is at the level of @xmath30mev , within a hadronization lifespan of 0.7fm / c half of the produced @xmath27 yield would become unobservable due to rescattering of decay products .",
    "such a resonance width of @xmath30mev is natural for a 400 mev excited hadronic resonance state , once presence of the medium removes superselection constraints .",
    "another proposed explanation of the @xmath31 riddle is that there is @xmath25 yield enhancement by regeneration @xcite .",
    "this @xmath32 production mechanism is generally associated with a long lived hadron phase .",
    "factor 5 enhancement over statistical hadronization yield is needed so that given the life span difference , the apparent reduction of @xmath27 by factor 2 is consistent with the observed high @xmath25 yield .",
    "we are assuming here that the regeneration of @xmath27 by @xmath33 collisions is not significant .",
    "however , a large @xmath25 yield enhancement contradicts basic principles , in that the heavy @xmath25 would compete with @xmath34 in the overall bare yield .",
    "for this reason , we do not believe that this is a viable explanation .",
    "we conclude that the statistical hadronization is doing reasonably well , the predictions in general agree with experiment in considerable detail , and where strong deviation is observed ( @xmath27 ) a good reason for this is at hand .",
    "resonances test both statistical hadronization , and the nature of the hadronization process @xcite , and open a path to study in medium modifications of particle hadronic widths .",
    "the freeze out temperature determines the shape of initially produced particle spectra , and thus it has considerable influence over their yield as well .",
    "however , the normalization of the spectra and thus particle yields are more directly controlled by the particle fugacity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is particle ` @xmath37 ' chemical potential . since for each related particle and antiparticle pair",
    "we need two chemical potentials , it has become convenient to choose parameters such that we can control the difference , and sum of these separately .",
    "for example for nucleons and antinucleons @xmath38 the two chemical factors are chosen as : @xmath39 @xmath40    the role of the two factors can be understood considering the first law of thermodynamics : @xmath41 the ( baryo)chemical potential @xmath42 , controls the baryon number , arising from the particle difference .",
    "@xmath43 , the phase space occupancy , regulates the number of nucleon  antinucleon pairs present .",
    "there are many different hadrons , and in principle , we should assign to each a chemical potential and then look for chemical reactions which relate these chemical potentials .",
    "however , more direct way to accomplish the same objective consists in characterizing each particle by the valance quark content @xcite , forming a product of chemical factors , _",
    "e.g. _ , for @xmath44 , @xmath45    considering the isospin symmetry of strong interactions aside of the three quark fugacities @xmath46 , we also introduce the light quark fugacity : _",
    "q^2=_u_d , _ b=_q^3 . to transcribe the fugacities into chemical potentials we recall : _",
    "i = e^_i / t,_q=12 ( _ u+_d ) .",
    "the relation between quark based chemical potentials and the two principal hadron based chemical potentials of baryon number and hadron strangeness @xmath47 is : _",
    "b=3_q_s=1 3 _ b-_s , _ s=_q_s .    an important ( historical ) anomaly is the negative s - strangeness in @xmath48-hadrons , _",
    "e.g. _ : @xmath49 @xmath50    there are two types of chemical factors @xmath51 and @xmath52 and thus two types of chemical equilibria .",
    "these are shown in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the absolute equilibrium is reached when the phase space occupancy approaches unity , @xmath53 .",
    "the distribution of flavor ( strangeness ) among many hadrons is governed by the relative chemical equilibrium .    0.3 cm    .[parameters]four quarks @xmath54 require four chemical parameters ; right : name of the associated chemical equilibrium [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the quality of rhic results presented in confirms that the statistical hadronization mechanism is an appropriate particle production model in presence of the _ sudden qgp breakup _ which without doubt is seen at rhic",
    ". however , the statistical hadronization approach may be not entirely appropriate at low sps energies , and all ags energies .",
    "it is possible that kinetic models need to be applied , which allow for a multitude of freeze - out conditions depending on the nature of particle considered .",
    "for this reason , when we study this energy domain we will look more closely at the behavior of individual observable ( @xmath55 ) rather than at the global yields of all particles , the method we are using at rhic and high sps energies .",
    "the non - equilibrium parameters @xmath56 we find in our fits are shown in as function of collision energy . in top figure ,",
    "open squares show the result when we fix @xmath57 .",
    "we note that in this case the sps fits yield @xmath58 .",
    "however , we see that @xmath59 is preferred in all cases , with value converging toward the limit @xmath60 .",
    "this behavior reflects on the need to account for the excess in charged hadron multiplicity . with this large @xmath61 also @xmath62",
    "is found to be quite large , in particular so at rhic .",
    "we need to solidify this result since this is indeed the expected signature of the sudden hadronization of deconfined strangeness rich qgp phase .",
    "+    we next address the reaction mechanisms , evaluating the energy stopping .",
    "we define it as the ratio of the thermal energy @xmath63 found in particles produced and normalized to a nucleon pair , with the collision energy @xmath64 which is also given per colliding nucleon pair .",
    "this study will allow us to consider the energy dependence of other variables as function of the energy available @xmath63 in the fireball , rather than as function of the energy of colliding nuclei @xmath64 , which in its greatest part may not participate in the reaction .",
    "the open triangles represent energy stopping for the fit assuming full chemical equilibrium .",
    "we note that at sps this leads to the absurd behavior that stopping is increasing with increasing collision energy , reaching 70% at the top energy .",
    "this alone proves that the chemical equilibrium approach to statistical hadronization is physically meaningless .    the open squares in show the stopping found for the case of semi - equilibrium fit , _",
    "i.e. _ , allowing only strange quarks to be out of chemical equilibrium . the full squares in apply full chemical non - equilibrium with phase space occupancy shown in . up to the step - up between sps and",
    "rhic we see a smooth fall of of the stopping with increasing collision energy when chemical non - equilibrium is allowed for .",
    "we recall that the statistical hadronization study we have made assumes tacitly that bjorken rapidity scaling applies exactly .",
    "one would hope that the rhic stopping result will come down when we allow for the non - scaling yields of particles .",
    "we would like to compare the efficiency of strangeness and entropy production between the two widely different systems considered .",
    "we evaluate the number of strange quark pairs produced ( strangeness yield ) and divide it by the computed thermal fireball baryon number .",
    "this eliminates the need for an absolute yield normalization .",
    "more generally , a ratio of two extensive computed variables is nearly independent of the dynamics of hadronization .    in , we present strangeness production per baryon .",
    "the top section shows our result as a function of the collision energy .",
    "when using the thermal energy content in the reaction , we arrive at the result with a smoothly rising curve seen in the bottom figure section .",
    "as noted in the insert , strangeness yield is rising faster than linearly with fireball energy content .",
    "+    we next look at strangeness per entropy ,  @xmath65 , shown in .",
    "there is considerable physical importance of @xmath65 , since both entropy @xmath66 and strangeness @xmath48 are produced early on in kinetic processes , are nearly conserved in the hydrodynamical expansion of qgp , and increase only moderately in the hadronization of qgp .",
    "thus the value seen for @xmath65 is reflecting on the kinetic mechanisms operational in early stages of the heavy ion collision . because there is strangeness mass as energy threshold to overcome",
    ", one would expect that as the initial qgp phase becomes hotter with increasing collision energy , the excitation of strangeness grows more rapidly than excitation of entropy .",
    "we note , in , for the chemical non - equilibrium assumption , a smooth and slow increase of @xmath65 , from 0.02 to 0.025 at sps .",
    "the rhic-130 point is within the smooth extrapolation of the sps result .",
    "the low value of rhic-200 result is probably expressing a systematic error related to the absence of multistrange particles in the fit . while entropy is already fully accounted for , only availability of multistrange hadron results will allow to obtain a reliable strangeness yield .",
    "however , if this expectation is not fulfilled , it will be very important to obtain experimental results in the energy range between sps and rhic , in the domain where the change of the systematic behavior ( slope ) of @xmath65 as function of energy occurs .",
    "one of the most interesting questions is if there is an energy threshold for the formation of a new state of matter . in our study of strangeness per entropy @xmath65 , in subsection [ stranges ] , we have seen a possibility that new physics sets in between the sps and rhic-130 energy domain .",
    "however , a final verdict on this issue depends on further rhic-200 results .",
    "the na49 experiment has been exploring the low energy domain at sps in search for a new physics threshold between ags and sps energy range .",
    "we refer to the report by marek gadzicki for the set of arguments that just at the bottom of sps energy range something new happens @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most important evidence cited by marek is a peak in the @xmath0 ratio , see top section of @xcite .",
    "-.1 cm -.1 cm -.1 cm    we think that this peak is purely an effect of the dense baryon medium . as the collision energy increases , beginning with low energies , the baryon density increases .",
    "however , at some collision energy baryons shoot through and the baryon density begins to drop . since there is considerable sensitivity to baryon chemical potential and thus baryon density in the @xmath0 ratio considered by the na49 collaboration , we prefer to consider the nearly baryon density independent ratio , =",
    ".    we present @xmath67 double ratio in the bottom of as black filled square . at high energy , we show the two rhic results and at sps and ags energies we use the na49 data set @xcite .",
    "the open squares are for the charged ratio k@xmath68 measured in @xmath69 reactions , which is offering an upper limit on @xmath67 from @xmath69 reactions , also using na49 data set .",
    "we indicate for @xmath70 the @xmath7@xmath71 tevatron result @xcite .",
    "both upper and lower portion of are drawn on same scale .",
    "comparing the top and bottom in , we see that the peak between ags and sps energy domain has completely disappeared , and that in the sps energy domain the @xmath55 ratio is flat .",
    "this behavior we already saw in the ratio of strangeness to entropy , bottom of .",
    "moreover , when we look at the inverse slopes of the k@xmath72 @xmath73-distributions , , we again see in sps domain a flat distribution @xcite .",
    "although the large error bars leave a lot of space for further structure , we do not see any evidence for a ` peak ' in strangeness production , rather we believe that na49 has discovered that @xmath0 ratio allows to determine where the baryon density peaks as function of collision energy .    as the dashed lines in the bottom portion of suggest",
    ", there is a smooth transition from rising to saturated behavior of @xmath67 ratio .",
    "however this behavior mirrors the result we see in the @xmath69 reactions , except that it occurs at lower collision energy .",
    "_ we conclude that if kaon and pion yields are solely used as the measuring stick for new physics , there is clear evidence that new physics is seen at rhic , where a true deviation from @xmath69 , @xmath1 behavior occurs .",
    "_      the enhancement of @xmath55 ratio at rhic may be , however , simply result of novel mechanism of pion suppression .",
    "we first recall that there is considerable increase in the transverse velocity of matter flow , as is born out , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the higher inverse slopes of particle spectra at rhic .",
    "we see this effect in for @xmath74",
    ".    the kinetic energy of this transverse motion must be taken from the thermal energy of the expanding matter , and ultimately this leads to local cooling and thus a reduction in the number of quarks and gluons .",
    "the local entropy density decreases , but the expansion assures that the total entropy still increases .",
    "primarily , gluons are feeding the expansion dynamics , while strangeness being weaker coupled remain least influenced by this dynamics .",
    "model calculations show that there is practically no strangeness reannihilation in transverse expansion at rhic @xcite .",
    "the depletion of the non - strange degrees of freedom in the feeding of the expansion assures an increase in the @xmath55 ratio with increase of collision energy .",
    "this effect explains why @xmath75 , see table [ tmurhic ] .",
    "if depletion by transverse expansion dynamics of the non - strange hadrons is the origin of the increase in @xmath55 at rhic , then this effect would arise gradually as function of collision energy .",
    "if , however , new phase of matter is the cause for this increase , we would expect a more ` edgy ' onset of the increase in the energy domain between sps and rhic .",
    "an even greater effect can be expected at future cern lhc collider . for heavy ions lhc",
    "will be a 6000gev collider , 30 times the maximum energy at rhic .",
    "the transverse expansion dynamics effects should be much greater at lhc and we expect significantly grater @xmath55 ratio , and thus greater value of @xmath76 .",
    "the only limit that we can see for a rise in @xmath76 , which is the factor controlling the rise in @xmath55 , is the condensation limit , : @xmath77 we have shown the resulting maximal value of @xmath55 in as a solid line as function of hadronization temperature .    the dashed line in shows the result when @xmath78 . depending on what we believe to be a valid hadronization temperature for a fast transversely expanding fireball , the possible enhancement in the @xmath55 ratio will be in the range of a factor 23 .",
    "the arrow indicates whereto the ratio converges for @xmath79 .",
    "this limit applies to both solid and dashed lines and critically depends on the high mass resonances which we really do not know very well .",
    "it can be assumed that hadronization at lhc occurs in a temperature domain @xmath80mev . in this case",
    "even more interesting than the @xmath55 ratio enhancement would be the associated enhancement anomaly in strange ( antibaryon ) yields .",
    "one would find a strong inversion in the population , with the more strange baryons and antibaryons being more abundant than less strange species .",
    "we have shown that strangeness at cern - sps and bnl - rhic is a well developed tool allowing to study qgp - hadronization .",
    "our discussion has shown that a systematic study of strange hadrons fingerprints the properties of a new state of matter .",
    "we have argued that the deconfinement specific observable is strangeness , and we have explained why we have little doubt that deconfined phase has been formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions .    the situation about deconfinement onset as function of energy is today much less clear than ever before .",
    "we argue here ( subsection [ kpi ] ) that between ags and sps energy range a smooth transition to a saturated @xmath55 yield is seen .",
    "this behavior mirrors the behavior of slopes of @xmath73 kaon spectra . at sps",
    ", we note a great enhancement of strange antibaryon yields , rising with strangeness content .",
    "analysis of strange hadrons shows that the specific strangeness yield is very high .",
    "the strangeness production and hadronization at sps is consistent with the behavior of the qgp phase .",
    "somewhere between sps and rhic the yield of @xmath55 begins to rise above the elementary reaction result .",
    "we saw , in the same energy range , a possible anomaly in the strangeness to entropy ratio @xmath65 , subsection [ stranges ] .",
    "however , we argue in subsection [ lhc ] that the @xmath55 ratio rise could be a dynamical effect due to rapid transverse expansion , and we discuss in subsection [ stranges ] that the @xmath65 anomaly could be removed by more comprehensive results forthcoming from rhic-200 run . thus , at this time , rhic could harbor some great new discovery , or be a qgp producer with a more powerful transverse expansion and grater energy density . the behavior of particle spectra support this view @xcite .",
    "the bnl - rhic experimentalists announced recently the discovery of new physical phenomena , jet quenching , as would be expected in qgp . in february 2000",
    "cern - sps experimental groups have combined their experimental results to claim a discovery of new state of matter , which looks like qgp .",
    "aside of strange hadron evidence , several other observables were implicated in the cern announcement .",
    "discovery of qgp is also claimed in the study of @xmath69 reactions @xcite .",
    "this work evaluates the ideal gas degrees of freedom which number is enhanced as expected in qgp phase .",
    "though there was not much ags public relation campaign , we do not see a reason why deconfined state formation did not occur at these low energies .",
    "if the criterion of relevance is the heating of nuclear matter to the phase boundary found in lattice gauge calculations , this is achieved at the mid - range of ags collision energy . however , in this case the new phase of matter is embedded in the center of a opaque hadron shell . only electromagnetic probes would have allowed to see into the heart of such low energy fireball .",
    "a new experimental facility with much more intense beams is needed to perform such experiments .    a student reading this report may find a useful summary of facts about qgp , physics of strangeness , and statistical hadronization .",
    "the advanced qgp researcher will find here practical and useful results addressing analysis of the rhic-130 and rhic-200 experimental data , and a comparison with sps results .",
    "these results do suggest that through study of strangeness at rhic we should soon understand better the properties of the hot hadron fireball and its presumably deconfined structure .",
