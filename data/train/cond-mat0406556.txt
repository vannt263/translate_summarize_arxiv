    "the study of financial market microstructure has been the object of intense research since the beginning of mathematical finance @xcite .",
    "thus one of the first models of market microstructure was set by bachelier who proposed the mechanism of the random walk ( rw ) to represent the dynamics of speculative prices @xcite .",
    "in fact bachelier s rw , with slight modifications and additions , has been successfully applied to a variety of problems in finance ranging from price dynamics to option pricing @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , rw models because of their gaussian nature fail to account for a universal characteristic of price distributions : the fact that they are highly leptokurtic , with considerable fat tails at the wings of the distributions @xcite .",
    "this was one of the main reasons which led mandelbrot to propose the levy distribution as an alternative description of the probability distribution of prices @xcite .",
    "however , pure levy models have a serious drawback since any statistical moment , beyond the first one , does not exist .",
    "this fact has induced some authors to propose truncated levy walks ( tlw ) as an alternative model .",
    "tlw s have the advantage of having finite moments up to some order ( which depends on the truncation procedure ) while keeping , to some extend , some quite attractive properties of tl s such as self - similarity and scaling laws @xcite .",
    "one of the problems of tl s is that the truncation is an ad - hoc procedure with little relation , if any , with the underlying dynamics .",
    "alternative models based on the gaussian process plus jumps @xcite or even continuous jumps @xcite have also been proposed with acceptable results .",
    "continuous time random walks ( ctrw s ) are general models which perhaps better capture market microstructure , specially that of high frequency data .",
    "ctrw s were first introduced by montroll and weiss in 1965 @xcite and have a long history of successful applications to physics , chemistry and geophysics to name a few @xcite . to our knowledge , the application of the ctrw to finance is quite recent and it has not been fully developed its potential @xcite .",
    "one of the applications where ctrw s may represent a valuable achievement is in the field of risk control because the ctrw formalism provides a natural way of treating any particular realization of the price or return processes .",
    "this , in turn , facilitates the study of extreme events which are central to risk management .    the statistics of extremes is a difficult field in probability theory and its thorough description for a given random process",
    "can be quite involved , if not impossible , from an analytical point of view @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use the ctrw formalism to study some aspects of the extreme value problem applied to finance .",
    "we will focus our attention on two of the simplest quantities related to extreme statistics : the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) and the mean exit time ( met ) .",
    "mfpt is the average time at which the random process reaches , for the first time , some pre - assigned value while met is the mean time when the random process leaves , for the first time , a given interval .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we outline the ctrw formalism and briefly describe some of its applications . in sec .",
    "iii we develop the theory of met for financial time series and apply it to real data in sec . iv .",
    "closing remarks are in sec . v.",
    "in this section we summarize the main features of the ctrw formalism applied to the analysis of financial time series .",
    "we refer to the reader to @xcite for a more complete account on the subject .",
    "let @xmath0 be a financial price and let @xmath1 be any initial time .",
    "the log - price or return is defined by .",
    "if @xmath2 is the return mean value , we define the zero - mean return by @xmath3 for the rest of the paper we will assume that the return is a stationary random process independent of any initial time @xmath1 which is taken to be zero , @xmath4 .",
    "hence @xmath5 refers to a time interval .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is described by a ctrw .",
    "in this representation any trajectory consists of a series of step functions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . therefore , @xmath6 changes at random times @xmath7 and we assume that sojourns or waiting times , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , are independent and identically distributed random variables described by a given probability density function ( pdf ) defined by @xmath10 . at the conclusion of a given sojourn the return @xmath6 suffers a random jump described by the random variable @xmath11 whose pdf is defined by @xmath12 .",
    "we combine these two causes of randomness into one single density @xmath13 which represents the joint pdf of waiting times and random jumps , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath14 we will further assume that @xmath13 is an even function of @xmath15 so that there is no net drift in the evolution of @xmath6 .",
    "note that if waiting times and jumps are independent random quantities , then @xmath16 .",
    "in any other situation one has to specify a functional form of @xmath13 that is compatible with the observed data .",
    "moreover , since the jump pdf , @xmath17 , and the waiting - time pdf , @xmath18 , are the marginal densities of the joint density , any proposed form of @xmath13 must satisfy @xmath19    the main objective of the ctrw is obtaining the so - called propagator , that is , the probability density function of the zero - mean return @xmath6 : @xmath20 in @xcite we have obtained a general expression for the joint fourier - laplace transform of the propagator , @xmath21 in terms of the laplace transform of the waiting time distribution , @xmath22 , and the fourier - laplace transform of the joint distribution , @xmath23 .",

    "we would need to specify the form of the joint density @xmath13 which has to be guessed from data @xcite .",
    "there are nonetheless some general results that are independent of the model chosen for @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "we briefly outline them :    ( )    if the mean waiting time @xmath25 is finite and the jump pdf @xmath17 has a finite second moment , , the asymptotic distribution of returns for long times approaches to the gaussian density : @xmath26 and the asymptotic variance grows linearly with time : @xmath27    if @xmath17 is a long - tailed density , _",
    "i. e. , _ @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath30 as @xmath31 for @xmath32 . moreover , if we assume that for @xmath33 small @xmath34 , then the asymptotic return pdf approaches to the lvy distribution : @xmath35    at intermediate times , @xmath36 , the behavior of @xmath37 for large values of @xmath38 , is the same as that of the jump distribution : @xmath39    from points ( a ) and ( b ) we see that the ctrw formalism unifies two of the approaches mentioned in sec .",
    "i : the bachelier s rw ( gaussian models ) and mandelbrot s levy models , thus providing a natural way of understanding the truncation procedures appearing in tlw models .",
    "finally , point ( c ) shows that fat tails in price distributions have their origin in fat tails in the jump distribution .",
    "hence , by observing the jump pdf @xmath17 which is more easily accessible than the complete pdf @xmath37 , one can infer the approximate behavior at the tails of @xmath37 via eq .",

    "we therefore see that _ the ctrw formalism unifies in a single model the main characteristics observed in the empirical distributions of prices_.",
    "we assume that the zero - mean return process @xmath6 is described by a ctrw with a given waiting - time distribution , @xmath18 , jump distribution , @xmath17 , and joint density , @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that initially the return has a known value @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath41 we ask ourselves the following question : at which time interval @xmath6 leaves a given interval @xmath42 $ ] for the first time ?",
    "in other words , at which time the return is greater than certain value @xmath43 or smaller than @xmath44 for the first time ?",
    "we call this quantity the exit time out of the interval @xmath42 $ ] and denote it by @xmath45 .",
    "obviously @xmath45 is a random variable since it depends on the particular trajectory of @xmath6 chosen ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "our main objective here is to obtain , based on the ctrw formalism , the mean exit time ( met ) @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to met problems requires the knowledge of the survival probability of the process in the interval @xmath42 $ ] @xcite .",
    "although the interest in knowing the survival probability is beyond any doubt , its attainment turns out to be quite involved . in this paper",
    "we present a direct and much simpler derivation of the met and leave obtaining the survival probability for a later work .",
    "we decompose @xmath47 in two summands @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the met to leave the interval @xmath42 $ ] in _ only one jump _ and @xmath50 is the met when more jumps have occurred .",

    "if the random walker has not exited the interval in the first jump the process will have attained at time @xmath5 some value @xmath54 $ ] inside the interval and from that point the mean exit time will be exactly @xmath55 .",

    "we will see examples of exact and approximate solutions .",
    "an important point should be emphasized : the fact that , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ met ] ) , the met does not depend on the possible coupling between waiting times and jumps . in other words , @xmath47 is independent of the particular form of the joint density @xmath13 .",
    "another extreme time closely related to the met is the mean first - passage time , mfpt , defined as the mean time at which the process attains a given value @xmath60 for the first time .",

    "however , we can always transform the problem in order to work on a symmetrical interval , something that lightens the problem .",

    "[ fig3 ] we compare the empirical met from the u.s .",
    "dollar / deutsche mark data with the analytical approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ metapproxsym ] ) .",
    "we see there that when @xmath17 is estimated by the power law ( [ empiricalh ] ) , with the numerical values for @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 given above , the theoretical expression does not fit the empirical data in a satisfactory manner .",
    "the reason for it lies in the fact the approximation for @xmath47 given by eq.([metapproxsym ] ) basically depends on the values of @xmath17 around @xmath74 while the power law density  ( [ empiricalh ] ) has been obtained to fit the tails of the jump distribution rather than its center .    on the other hand",
    ", we can easily evaluate the values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 directly from data without assuming any hypothesis on the form of the jump distribution .",
    "this yields @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "we also need an estimation for @xmath124 although this parameter is quite difficult to evaluate because data binning entails a certain degree of arbitrariness .",
    "moreover the very existence of tick units questions the concept of derivative .",

    "( [ metapproxsym ] ) using the numerical values of @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 just reported , then the resulting function fits to some extend the empirical met albeit being not completely satisfactory",
    ". a better fit of @xmath128 can be obtained by using the same values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 but estimating @xmath124 in order to furnish an optimal fit for the met which finally yields the value @xmath129 .",
    "this is represented by the solid line curve of fig .",
    "note that this final estimation shows that the approximate expressions for the met given by eqs .",
    "( [ metapprox ] ) and  ( [ metapproxsym ] ) are very efficient since they almost exactly reproduce the empirical behavior of the met far away from the validness of the approximation itself , which we recall was only effective for small values of the normalized interval @xmath130 .",
    "we can thus conclude that the met presents a quadratic nature regardless the length of the interval .",
    "all of this seems to indicate that the approximations given by eqs .",
    "( [ metapprox ] ) and ( [ metapproxsym ] ) have a more universal character than one might expect in advance .",
    "we finally observe that the laplace density given by eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) , which yields the exact met ( [ exactmetsim ] ) , results in a good approximation of the met for small values of the interval as we can also see in fig . [ fig3].in this regard the laplace density can be considered as a first approximation to any more realistic jump distribution .",
    "using the ctrw framework for market microstructure , we have developed a somewhat little known aspect of the problem : the study of extreme events , specially the mean exit time out of an interval , @xmath47 , and the mean first - passage time to some critical value , @xmath131 , although the latter turns out to be infinite in many situations .",
    "we have shown that these extreme times obey an integral equation which depends on the jump distribution @xmath17 and the mean waiting time @xmath25 .",
    "we have exactly solved the integral equation for the met in the case where the jump distribution is governed by a laplace ( symmetric exponential ) probability density function .",
    "we have compared this met with that of the ordinary random walk model and showed that the met for the laplace density is bigger than @xmath132 ( the met when @xmath6 is assumed to be the wiener process ) .",
    "this seems to indicate that the models based on the wiener process may underestimate the met ( specially for small intervals ) . in other words ,",
    "rw models imply that the return process escapes faster from a give interval than models based on the ctrw .",
    "we believe that this can have practical consequences in risk control as well as in pricing exotic derivatives .",
    "we have also solved the integral equation for the met using an approximate scheme which yields a solution valid for a general @xmath17 but when the length @xmath133 of the interval is small ( in an appropriate dimensionless scale ) .",
    "we have showed that for the laplace form of @xmath17 the approximate solution for small @xmath133 coincides with the exact solution , therefore showing that the laplace is a  first - order approximation \" to any sufficiently smooth and symmetrical jump distribution .",
    "we have applied the approximate solution to real data ( high frequency data on u.s .",
    "dollar - deutsche mark futures market ) with a very good agreement between the empirical and the theoretical met .",
