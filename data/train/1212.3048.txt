    "we provide a brief summary of the research carried out over the last few years , with emphasis on three - dimensional radiative transfer investigations of the hanle effect in the  line at 4607   and of the zeeman effect in some  lines .",

    "the wavelength positions of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) transitions do not coincide and , therefore , their respective polarization signals do not cancel out .",
    "the zeeman effect is most sensitive in circular polarization ( quantified by the stokes @xmath1 parameter ) with a @xmath9 amplitude that for not too strong fields scales with the ratio , @xmath10 , between the zeeman splitting @xmath11 and the doppler line - width @xmath12 : @xmath13 with @xmath14 the atomic weight of the atom under consideration .",
    "the stokes @xmath1 signal changes its sign for opposite orientations of the magnetic field vector .",

    "the spectral line polarization that is induced by scattering processes in stellar atmospheres is directly related with the anisotropic illumination of the atoms .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field is not necessary for producing such a polarization .",
    "the absorption of anisotropic radiation produces atomic level polarization ( i. e. , population imbalances and/or quantum coherence between the magnetic sublevels pertaining to the upper and/or lower level of the line transition under consideration ) , in such a way that the populations of substates with different values of @xmath27 are different . under such circumstances , the polarization signals of the @xmath3 and @xmath28 transitions",
    "do not cancel out , even in the absence of a magnetic field , simply because the population imbalances among the magnetic sublevels imply more or less @xmath3 transitions , per unit volume and time , than @xmath28 transitions .",
    "such anisotropic radiation pumping processes are particularly efficient in creating atomic polarization if the depolarizing rates caused by elastic collisions are sufficiently low .",
    "is the modification of the atomic level polarization and of its ensuing observable effects on the emergent stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 profiles .",
    "it is caused by the action of a magnetic field such that the corresponding zeeman splitting is comparable to the inverse lifetime , @xmath29 , of the degenerate atomic level under consideration ( the upper or lower level of the chosen line transition ) . for the hanle effect to operate , the magnetic field vector has to be inclined with respect to the symmetry axis of the pumping radiation field . typically ( but not always ) , the changes in the stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 profiles due to the hanle effect consist in a net depolarization and a rotation of the direction of linear polarization .",
    "if the azimuth of the magnetic field is uniformly distributed within the resolution element of the observation , rotations of the direction of linear polarization cancel out , but the reduction of the scattering polarization amplitude with respect to the zero - field case remains .",
    "therefore , the hanle effect has the diagnostic potential for detecting tangled magnetic fields on subresolution scales in the solar atmosphere .",
    "fortunately , scattering processes in the solar atmosphere produce a rich linearly - polarized spectrum ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stenflo & keller 1997 ) ) .",
    "most of our present empirical knowledge on solar surface magnetism stems from the analysis of the spectral line polarization caused by the zeeman effect .",
    "diagnostic tools based on the zeeman effect aim at determining the magnetic field strength , the magnetic flux , and the inclination of the magnetic field . the advantages and disadvantages of stokes diagnostics based on the zeeman effect",
    "have been repeatedly discussed in the literature .",
    "an attractive feature is the relative simplicity of the physics of the zeeman effect .",
    "the mere detection of the signature of the zeeman effect in the observed spectral line polarization can be directly interpreted as the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "another good news for the polarization of the zeeman effect as a diagnostic tool is the large number of methods developed to extract quantitative properties of the magnetic field ( see , for example , the reviews by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* solanki 1993 ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "* snchez almeida 1997 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* socas - navarro et al . 2000 ) ) .    among the major shortcomings we should mention the following ones .",
    "first , the zeeman polarization signals observed in the quiet sun are very weak compared to those observed in active regions , so that quantitative diagnostics of the magnetic field properties are always challenged by the presence of the measurement noise ( e.g. , asensio ramos 2009 ) .",
    "second , the polarization of the zeeman effect as a diagnostic tool is practically _ blind _ to magnetic fields that are randomly oriented on scales too small to be resolved .",
    "in other words , the zeeman polarization signals tend to cancel out when averaging .",
    "this is exactly the situation in the internetwork regions of the quiet sun , where the observed stokes @xmath1 signals show an intermittent pattern of positive and negative polarities at spatial scales as small as the diffraction limit of the telescope used .",
    "for this reason , one expects that zeeman - polarization inferences of @xmath30 ( the mean unsigned  vertical \" magnetic flux density ) depend on the spatial resolution of the observation . as it can be seen in figure 3 of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* snchez almeida & martnez gonzlez ( 2011 ) ) , such unsigned flux density seems indeed to be larger at the close to 0.3 arcsec resolution of hinode ( @xmath31 ) than at the 1 arcsec resolution of some ground - based observations ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "such a figure suggests that the average unsigned vertical magnetic flux density increases with increasing angular resolution ( i.e. , with decreasing size of the resolution element @xmath33 ) , as expected for the case of polarization signals produced by the random association of equal independent structures with size @xmath34 smaller than @xmath33 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* snchez almeida 2009 ) ) .",
    "such a tentative extrapolation predicts a magnetic flux density of 36 g or 181 g , depending on whether the intrinsic size @xmath34 is 100 km or 20 km , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , there is a large scatter in the unsigned flux density values obtained from high spatial resolution zeeman - polarization measurements taken with the hinode satellite ( spatial resolution of about 0.3 arcsec ) and the imax instrument on board sunrise ( spatial resolution of about 0.15 arcsec ) .",
    "the values reported so far do not seem to show the above - mentioned expected behavior ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* orozco surez & bellot rubio 2012 ) , and more references therein ) .",
    "* snchez almeida & martnez gonzlez ( 2011 ) ) argue that these apparent inconsistencies are mostly due to unaccounted biases in the applied diagnostic techniques .    summarizing",
    ", we can conclude that using only the zeeman polarization technique is not a very suitable strategy for investigating magnetic fields that have complex unresolved geometries .",
    "there is some evidence that the complexity of the ss fields of the quiet sun is so considerable that with the present instrumentation zeeman effect diagnostics allow us to detect only the tip of the iceberg of the quiet sun magnetism .",
    "for example , a recent estimation by pietarila - graham et al .",
    "( 2009 ) predicts that @xmath35  % of the stokes-@xmath1 signals existing in the surface dynamo simulations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vgler & schssler ( 2007 ) ) would not be observable at the hinode resolution of 0.3 arcsec ( cf .",
    ", emonet & cattaneo 2001 ; snchez almeida et al .",
    "fortunately , unresolved magnetic fields can be detected through the hanle effect .",
    "since opposite polarity fields contribute with the same sign to the hanle depolarization , the hanle effect in suitably chosen spectral lines was correctly considered a potentially powerful tool to explore ss magnetic fields that are tangled on scales too small to be resolved ( stenflo 1982 ) .",
    "another important advantage of the hanle effect as a diagnostic tool of the quiet sun magnetism is that it is sensitive to much weaker magnetic fields than those that can be detected through the zeeman effect ( i.e. , in the range from @xmath36 g up to a few hundred gauss , depending on the line transition ) .",
    "the main disadvantage is that magnetic fields stronger than the hanle saturation limit remain virtually indistinguishable ( e.g. , in the case of the  4607   line , for magnetic strengths @xmath37 g ) .",
    "therefore , both plasma diagnostic tools are rather complementary .",
    "a useful formula to estimate the magnetic field strength , @xmath38 ( measured in g ) , for the onset of the hanle effect in a line transition without atomic polarization in its lower level ( such as that of sr i at 4607  ) is ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * trujillo bueno & manso sainz 1999 ) ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the collisional depolarizing rate ( typically due to elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms ) in units of the einstein @xmath41 coefficient for spontaneous emission , and @xmath42 is the magnetic strength for which the zeeman splitting of the line s upper level is equal to its natural width ( @xmath43 being the level s land factor ) .    a first rough estimate of the hanle - effect depolarization needed to explain",
    "some line scattering polarization observations of quiet regions of the solar atmosphere had suggested a tentative lower limit to the mean field strength @xmath44 of 10 g ( ( * ? ? ? * stenflo 1982 ) ) . in recent years",
    "the hanle effect has changed from being considered an exotic theoretical ( de)polarization mechanism to a powerful tool for the diagnostics of the solar magnetism .",
