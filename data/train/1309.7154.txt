    "et al._@xcite though the properties of glueballs can not be obtained analytically through qcd , they are predicted in many models based on qcd or in lattice qcd .",
    "therefore , the discovery of a glueball will be a direct test of qcd theory .",
    "people has searched for the glueball for a long time .",
    "so far , there is no conclusive evidence of glueball except for several observed candidates .",
    "no matter whether glueball exists or not , it is important to understand their spectroscopy .",
    "so far , there are not so many work concentrated on the productions and decays of glueballs , but there are many work on the masses of glueballs .",
    "related references can be found in some reviews and therein  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the @xmath3 scalar glueball has the lowest mass .",
    "the first assumption of the mass @xmath4 of the scalar glueball is by novikov _",
    "et al . , _ where @xmath4 was assumed around @xmath5 mev@xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules predict the mass of this kind of glueball around @xmath6 gev  @xcite , and lattice theory gives the mass around @xmath7 gev  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the gravity / gauge , or anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence  @xcite , qcd is in one side modeled by a deformation of the super yang - mills theory ( so called top - down  @xcite approach ) . on the other side ,",
    "a five dimensional holographic qcd is constructed from the same correspondence ( so called bottom - up  @xcite approach ) . in the framework of holographic qcd ,",
    "some unsolvable problems in qcd are solvable .",
    "in particular , the hadrons of qcd correspond to the normalizable modes of the five dimensional ( 5d ) fields , and therefore many hadronic properties are predictive .    in ads",

    "are usually employed .",
    "the dilaton soft wall model with smooth cutoff seems suitable for the scalar glueball , which reproduces the expected regge trajectory .",

    "some theoretical predictions to the mass of scalar glueball are listed in table .",
    "obviously , the mass prediction which is waiting for an examination by experiment may be largely different in different models .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the two - point correlation function of the scalar operator has been analyzed in refs .",
