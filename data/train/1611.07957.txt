    "one of the distinctive characteristics of plasmas is that they have time and length scales that are typically well separated .",
    "for example , in a electron - proton plasma the mass ratio between the two species is approximately equal to 1836 , and this determines a separation of the same factor in the respective cyclotron frequencies , and of a factor @xmath0 in the respective larmor radii and plasma frequencies .",
    "such a large separation of scales translates very often into unaffordable costs , from a computational point of view .",
    "in particular , it is well known that a fully - kinetic treatment , where two vlasov equations ( one for each species ) are coupled to the maxwell s equations , is prohibitively expensive in multiple dimensions .",
    "for this reason , several reduced models have been studied in the past , that are able to retain some of the kinetic features of the plasma , at a reduced computational cost @xcite .",
    "such models could be ordered in a hierarchy that transitions all the way from kinetic to fluid theory @xcite . in this paper , we focus specifically on two models that have been extensively used for solar wind turbulence studies : the hybrid ( ion - kinetic and electron - fluid ) and the gyrokinetic models .",
    "the philosophy behind these two models is quite different . in the hybrid model",
    "the heavy species ( protons ) is treated kinetically and its distribution function obeys the vlasov equation ( which is in principle six - dimensional ) , while the light species ( electrons ) is treated as an inertia - less neutralizing fluid .",
    "thus , the computational saving is achieved by factoring out from the model the time and spatial scales associated with electrons .",
    "we note that the term `` hybrid '' is used widely in different contexts with different meanings , but here we use it with the specific meaning given .",
    "on the other hand , the gyrokinetic model treats both species kinetically , but it performs a time average on the ion cyclotron period . as a result",
    ", the six - dimensional distribution functions collapse into five dimensions .",
    "interestingly , such dimensionality reduction of the particle distribution functions ( and the fact that the dynamics faster than the ion gyro - period are neglected ) results into a sizable saving in computational time .",
    "+ like all reduced models , the derivation of the hybrid and gyrokinetic models is based on a certain number of assumptions .",
    "they both make use of the so - called quasi - neutrality condition , which asserts that ion and electron densities are equal , @xmath1 .",
    "this is satisfied as long as the debye length is much smaller than the characteristic spatial scales , and the characteristic frequencies are much smaller than the electron plasma frequency . as a consequence ,",
    "the displacement current in ampere s law is neglected in both models .",
    "furthermore , the gyrokinetic theory assumes that frequencies are much smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency : @xmath2 , and that the wave spectrum is very anisotropic : @xmath3 .",
    "the hybrid model , instead , necessitates of a closure in terms of an equation of state for the electrons .",
    "+ the fundamental problem that we tackle in this paper is : what does _ much smaller _ mean ?",
    "+ once a model ( and the computer code that solves it ) has been extensively used and benchmarked in a certain regime , it is certainly tempting to push the simulations into unexplored regimes .",
    "although there are cases for which the reduced models are obviously inadequate , there exist a large range of gray areas , where their validity is not obvious . in a sense ,",
    "the issue of validating a reduced model is an ill - posed problem . in principle",
    ", the validation of the results in these gray areas can only be performed by comparing with a fully - kinetic model . on the other hand ,",
    "if such solutions from the fully - kinetic models were available , one would not need to use a reduced model !",
    "+ the rationale for this work stems from the fact that recent simulations performed with hybrid and the gyrokinetic codes might be considered the current state - of - the - art in studies concerned with solar wind turbulence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , it is now widely recognized that a kinetic treatment is necessary for studying solar wind turbulence , at small scales @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to ask what is the range of validity of such models , and when the results start to deviate considerably from the correct solutions . here , we focus on comparing solutions obtained within the linear theory . clearly , the ability of a model to describe the property of linear waves , within a certain accuracy , can be interpreted as a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the model to yield reliable results in the non - linear regime . +",
    "the scope of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we directly compare linear theory solutions obtained from the hybrid and the gyrokinetic models with the complete vlasov - maxwell model , for wavevectors @xmath4 ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 the ion larmor radius ) , and for a wide range of propagation angles @xmath8 , ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ; second , we present a robust and novel methodology to perform such comparison in a fair way , that takes into account the fact that for large wavevector and/or propagation angles obtaining linear solutions is a non - trivial numerical exercise , due to the presence of many normal modes .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the methodology and the parameters chosen for a test case in section [ sec : methodology ] , where we also define the errors that will be measured .",
    "section [ sec : results ] shows the comparison between hybrid , gyrokinetic , and fully - kinetic solutions for a wide range of cases .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we study a plasma composed of electrons and protons , with mass ratio set to the physical value @xmath11 , in cartesian coordinates @xmath12 . as it is customary in linear theory , we study an uniform maxwellian plasma with density @xmath13 , in a constant magnetic field @xmath14 , that is perturbed with a small - amplitude plane wave of the form @xmath15 $ ] , with wavevector @xmath16 , and complex frequency @xmath17 . +",
    "we focus on a single choice of parameters that are relevant for solar wind turbulence studies . in order to facilitate comparisons",
    "with published literature , we use the typical solar wind parameters studied in @xcite : @xmath18 nt , @xmath19 ev ( electron temperature ) , @xmath20 ev ( proton temperature ) , @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the proton plasma beta is @xmath23 , and the electron plasma to cyclotron frequency ratio is @xmath24 .",
    "the ratio between alfvn and ion thermal velocities is @xmath25 , and the ratio between alfvn velocity and speed of light is @xmath26 .",
    "+ in all of the three cases considered ( fully - kinetic , hybrid , and gyrokinetic ) , the linear wave solutions are obtained by finding the complex frequencies @xmath27 for which the determinant of a @xmath28 matrix @xmath29 vanishes .",
    "@xmath30 is a nonlinear function of both @xmath31 and @xmath27 , and the standard way to numerically solve the problem , for a fixed @xmath31 , is by employing an iterative root finder based on newton s method .",
    "unfortunately , although it is straightforward to extend newton s method for finding zeros in the complex plane , the method can be very sensitive to the choice of an initial guess .",
    "moreover , due to the possible presence of multiple solutions which are close to each other in the complex plane , it is not always easy to track a solution @xmath27 varying @xmath31 . in other words ,",
    "the solver can easily jump from a solution branch to another , whenever two solutions get close enough .",
    "the paper by @xcite explains how to reduce the numerical error in calculating the elements of @xmath29 in the case of the vlasov - maxwell system .",
    "@xcite also suggests identifying possible roots by visual inspection of the function @xmath32 , where the peaks might indicate roots .",
    "an alternative way , which we think is more robust , less time consuming , and can be easily automated , is to analyze separately the real @xmath33 and imaginary @xmath34 parts of the function @xmath35 , and to identify the curves in the complex plane , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , that is where they change sign .",
    "clearly , the intersections of such curves ( @xmath38 ) are the roots @xmath39 , that can be used as initial guess for the newton solver , to achieve a better accuracy .",
    "we have employed this method to identify _ all _ the roots in a given region of the complex plane , in section [ sec : def_err ] + we refer to @xcite for a derivation of the gyrokinetic linear theory . the linear theory for the hybrid model can easily be derived by noting that , in the standard derivation of the vlasov - maxwell linear theory , the dielectric tensor @xmath40 is additive by species ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the unit dyadic , @xmath43 is the susceptibility of species @xmath44 , and the sum is over plasma species .",
    "therefore , in a hybrid model it is sufficient to calculate the electron susceptibilities @xmath45 derived within a two - fluid linear model . here",
    ", we have employed the so - called warm plasma dispersion relation derived in @xcite , which assumes the equation of state @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 the electron pressure , density , and thermal velocity , respectively ) . moreover , in order to enforce the quasi - neutrality condition , it sufficient to suppress the unit dyadic term in the dielectric tensor , which is thus defined simply as the sum of the ion susceptibility ( derived in kinetic theory ) and the electron one ( derived in two - fluid theory ) .",
    "the results obtained from hybrid and gyrokinetic linear theory are compared with the ones obtained in the fully - kinetic vlasov - maxwell theory .",
    "we divide the parameter space into _ oblique _ propagation , for @xmath50 , and _ quasi - perpendicular _ propagation , for @xmath51 .",
    "while the diagnostics used for oblique propagation are based on the comparison of single normal modes , we argue that such diagnostics are not sufficiently informative , for the quasi - perpendicular regime .",
    "typically , among the infinite number of modes which can in principle exist as solutions of the full linear vlasov - maxwell system , one is interested in the few that have lower damping rates , while the others ( usually referred to as heavily - damped ) are of little interest because , supposedly , they do not play a significant role for mode coupling .",
    "we note that this view , although probably correct when the modes are well separated , is questionable when there are a multitude of normal modes clustered together . in this case",
    ", one would like to take in considerations the overall spectral properties of the linear operator .",
    "such approach is justified by the _ non - normality _ of the vlasov - maxwell linear operator .",
    "we refer to , e.g. , @xcite and citations therein , for a discussion on non - normal linear operators in plasma physics . in short , and for the purpose of this paper",
    ", we recall that non - normality is due to the non - orthogonality of the eigenvectors of a linear operator , and is connected to the phenomena of transient growth , by - pass transitions and , generally , to mode coupling . an important characteristic of non - normal operators is that their eigenvalues are highly sensitive to perturbations , in the sense that the spectrum can be easily distorted in the complex plane , when the original operator is slightly perturbed .",
    "this concept gives rise to the idea of pseudospectrum , which is extensively discussed in @xcite and , for the case of the vlasov - maxwell system , in @xcite .",
    "for instance , figure [ fig : modes_80 ] shows a subset of the normal modes ( obtained in the fully - kinetic model ) , in the complex plane , for @xmath52 . the damping rate @xmath53 and the real frequency @xmath54 are on horizontal and vertical axis , respectively ( here and in all figures they are normalized to the ion cyclotron frequency @xmath55 ) .",
    "the different symbols are for @xmath5 ( blue dots ) , @xmath56 ( red circles ) , and @xmath57 ( black crosses ) . clearly , a distinction between modes purely based on their damping rate becomes less and less possible with increasing wavevector .",
    "moreover , there is no reason to attribute a particular importance to some well - characterized modes ( that is , well - characterized in the low @xmath4 and oblique propagation regime ) , such as the kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) mode .",
    "this is particularly clear by inspection of figure [ fig : modes_5_80 ] . here",
    ", we plot , in the top panel , the subset of normal modes that are confined in the complex plane within the domain @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the blue dots and red circles denote the fully - kinetic and the hybrid solutions , respectively . the kinetic alfvn wave , that is the root of the dispersion relation that when tracked to low @xmath4 and low @xmath8 is connected to the alfvn wave mode , is denoted with a blue cross ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) .",
    "it is evident that , in this regime , kaw is surrounded by many other modes , some of them with similar frequency but lower damping rate .",
    "nevertheless , kaw has been attributed a predominant role in some of the recent solar wind literature @xcite .",
    "even if one would like to adhere to the classical view where the least damped modes are more important than the heavily - damped one , it is clear that kaw is not special .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : modes_5_80 ] shows the same modes , but now sorted as function of their damping rate per wave period @xmath62 ( horizontal axis ) , and their polarization @xmath63 ( vertical axis ) .",
    "the polarization is here defined following @xcite , as @xmath64 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 complex amplitudes of the electric field .",
    "hence , negative / positive values of @xmath63 represent left / right hand polarization . interestingly , in this regime , kaw is the most rapidly damped mode per wave period .",
    "a final remark on figure [ fig : modes_5_80 ] is that one can see that , despite being in the electron range ( i.e. @xmath67 ) , the hybrid model captures most of the normal modes quite accurately .",
    "it creates a spurious mode with @xmath68 and @xmath69 due to the inability to account for electron landau damping .",
    "we define the following two measures of error , that assess the deviation of the frequency @xmath27 ( obtained either with hybrid or gyrokinetic ) , with respect to the correct value obtained with the vlasov - maxwell theory , denoted as @xmath70 : @xmath71 @xmath72}\\right ) - \\re\\left({\\exp[-i\\omega t]}\\right ) ||_2\\label{err_2}\\ ] ] the error @xmath73 in eq.([err_1 ] ) is simply the relative distance between the two frequencies , in the complex plane , and it does not distinguish the measure in which the real and the imaginary part ( damping rate ) of the frequency contribute to the error . in order to calculate the error denoted as @xmath74 in eq.([err_2 ] ) , we define a time interval @xmath75 $ ] , that covers one wave period ( with respect to @xmath70 ) , and is discretized in 200 points , and we calculate the @xmath76 norm of the difference of the real part of the wave amplitude ( normalized by the number of points ) .",
    "this metric is relevant because it comprises the information on how much a wave with frequency @xmath27 will differ , during one wave period , from the reference wave with frequency @xmath70 , by modeling its actual time evolution .",
    "+ moreover , we will use one more metric to compare results in the quasi - perpendicular regime . here , we seek to have a measure that gives us information on the global difference between the spectra calculated with the three methods . for this purpose",
    ", we rely on the ( generalized ) definition of the @xmath77-pseudospectrum @xmath78 , for a fixed @xmath31 : @xmath79 clearly , the pseudospectrum reduces to the standard spectrum ( set of eigenvalues ) for @xmath80 .",
    "for instance , figures [ fig : pseudo ] and [ fig : pseudo_k_1_85 ] compare the fully - kinetic ( left ) , hybrid ( middle ) , and gyrokinetic ( right ) pseudospectra for the case @xmath56 and @xmath52 ( figure [ fig : pseudo ] ) or @xmath81 ( figure [ fig : pseudo_k_1_85 ] ) , in the region @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the color plot is in logarithmic scale and denotes the value of @xmath84 .",
    "one can visually identify the eigenvalues as the points where the concentric curves are centered . in order to measure quantitatively the error in the pseudospectra",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "we compute , for a fixed value of @xmath85 the function @xmath86 on a @xmath87 grid covering the domain @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . because @xmath90 can vary several orders of magnitude within this domain",
    ", it is not convenient to calculate an error directly defined on @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , we seek to define an error that emphasizes the differences only in regions where @xmath91 is small , disregarding regions where @xmath90 is large .",
    "therefore , we map @xmath35 into a new function @xmath92 through a sigmoid : @xmath93 the new function @xmath92 is defined between 1 ( for @xmath94 ) and 10 ( for @xmath95 ) .",
    "finally , we define the error @xmath96 as : @xmath97 where the l-2 norm is normalized on the number of grid points .",
    "as we mentioned , one important assumption in the derivation of the gyrokinetic model is that @xmath3 .",
    "this requirement restricts dramatically the range of validity of the model . following the philosophy outlined in the introduction",
    ", we will compare the three models also in the non quasi - perpendicular propagation regime , that is , in a range where the gyrokinetic model is not expected to be valid .",
    "figure [ fig : validity_gk ] shows the range of validity of the gyrokinetic model .",
    "the symbols denote the angle of propagation @xmath8 for a given value of perpendicular wavevector @xmath98 , that results in a relative error on the kinetic alfvn wave real frequency of @xmath99 ( squares ) and @xmath100 ( diamonds ) .",
    "one can appreciate that for @xmath101 the propagation cone is restricted to angles very close to @xmath102 .",
    "an alternative way of appreciating this result is shown in figure [ fig : validity_gk_2 ] , that shows the dispersion relation for the alfvn / ion - cyclotron wave . when plotted as @xmath103 as a function of @xmath98 ,",
    "the dispersion relation becomes independent of angle , in gyrokinetics ( shown in blue ) .",
    "the red , yellow , and purple lines denote the fully - kinetic solution for angles of propagation @xmath104 .",
    "the gyrokinetic model has been suggested as a valid model for the study of solar wind turbulence all the way to electron scales @xcite , on the basis that some observational data suggest that the propagation angle in the solar wind averages at about 88 degrees , and across the examined spectra never fall below 60 degrees @xcite .",
    "it is not within the scope of this paper to discuss the issue of the observed wave spectrum anisotropy in the solar wind .",
    "however , it is fair to mention that the problem is still open , and some recent works have emphasized the importance of quasi - parallel wave propagation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the development of wave vector anisotropy is an open research question , for which linear properties over a range of propagation angles will be important .",
    "it is in this spirit that , in the following , we present a comparison of the models across a wide range of propagation angles .",
    "historically , different communities in plasma physics have adopted different nomenclatures for linear waves . here",
    "we follow the nomenclature adopted by @xcite . we will refer to alfvn / ion - cyclotron as the electromagnetic mode that is left - handed polarized for parallel propagation .",
    "the ion - acoustic mode is the one that connects to the electrostatic solution for parallel propagation , and the fast ( magnetosonic ) waves is the mode that connects to the right - handed polarized mode for parallel propagation . in this section",
    "we first discuss the dispersion relations of each one of these three modes , and then we compare the models comparing the pseudo - spectra in the quasi - perpendicular regime .",
    "figure [ fig : disp_rel_aic ] shows the dispersion relation for the aic mode , for angles of propagation @xmath105 .",
    "blue , red and green curves are for fully - kinetic , hybrid and gyrokinetic , respectively ( the same notation will be used for all following figures ) . the real frequency @xmath54 is shown in the top panel , and the damping rate in the bottom panel . in both panels",
    "@xmath98 is on the horizontal axis ( logarithmic scale is used on all axis ) .",
    "the three different propagation angles can be identified from the starting values of @xmath98 . since",
    "all the curves are plotted from @xmath5 , the initial perpendicular wavevector increases with increasing @xmath8 . for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the hybrid and fully - kinetic solutions",
    "are almost indistinguishable . in particular",
    ", the saturation of wave frequency is well represented .",
    "the corresponding damping rates present a mismatch at low @xmath4 and agree well at large @xmath4 .",
    "a peculiar feature of the @xmath108 solution is that a branch bifurcation happens around @xmath109 for the hybrid solution .",
    "the gyrokinetic solution does not capture the correct frequency saturation , for any angle of propagation , as expected .",
    "consequently , the frequencies of the gyrokinetic solutions become much higher than the correct values , even for @xmath110 .",
    "the gyrokinetic solutions are generally less damped than the correct fully - kinetic solutions ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the errors for the aic mode solutions are shown in figures [ fig : error_aic_10 ] , [ fig : error_aic_30 ] , [ fig : error_aic_60 ] , for the cases @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath111 , respectively . here , the hybrid model is shown in red , and the gyrokinetic in green .",
    "solid and dashed lines denote the errors @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "one can notice that the errors for the hybrid solutions are lower than the corresponding errors for the gyrokinetic model , for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "however , which model performs better for @xmath108 depends on @xmath98 the fact that the gyrokinetic errors in figure [ fig : error_aic_60 ] for @xmath108 do not grow very large , and almost saturate for @xmath112 , despite the fact that the dispersion relation shows a large mismatch with the fully - kinetic solution , is due to the fact that the mode becomes heavily damped , and therefore the contribution of the real frequency mismatch becomes negligible in the errors .",
    "+ moving to quasi - perpendicular angles , figure [ fig : disp_rel_aic_perp ] shows the dispersion relation for aic for @xmath113 ( from left to right ) .",
    "interesting , even at such large propagation angle , the aic resonate with ions and presents a frequency saturation .",
    "once again the gyrokinetic solution is quite faithful ( now both in frequency and damping rate ) up to the wavenumbers where the dispersion relation saturates . in this regime ,",
    "the hybrid solution presents larger errors , in particular close to the elbow of the curves , where the damping rates depart from the vlasov - maxwell values ( bottom panel ) .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath114 case , the saturated value of the hybrid solution is not correct ( being larger than @xmath115 ) .",
    "the respective errors are plotted in figures [ fig : error_aic_80 ] , [ fig : error_aic_85 ] , and [ fig : error_aic_89 ] .",
    "it is clear how the gyrokinetic solution gets better and better , with respect to the hybrid , with increasing angle of propagation ( only for wavevectors smaller than the value where dispersive effects take place ) .",
    "the dispersion relation for the ia mode is shown in figure [ fig : disp_rel_ia ] , with the same format as in the previous section .",
    "one can distinguish the following features .",
    "regarding the real frequency ( top panel ) , there is again a good agreement between hybrid and fully - kinetic ; the gyro - kinetic frequency also presents a similar agreement , but only for small @xmath4 values .",
    "damping rates present larger mismatches .",
    "notably , the dispersion relation for the case @xmath108 presents an elbow for @xmath116 that is captured by the hybrid model .",
    "we show the errors @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath106 , @xmath117 , @xmath108 respectively in figures [ fig : error_ia_10 ] , [ fig : error_ia_30 ] , and [ fig : error_ia_60 ] ( same format as previous section ) .",
    "the errors are now generally smaller for gyrokinetic at small @xmath98 , and increasing with wavector , and almost constant in value fo rhte hybrid solutions .",
    "the dispersion relation plots for quasi - perpendicular angles are shown in figure [ fig : disp_rel_ia_perp ] . similarly to the aic case , the gyrokinetic model reproduces more faithfully the vlasov - maxwell solutions , until dispersive effects take place .",
    "a small but noticeable mismatch in the sound speed can be noted for the hybrid solution , that is shifted vertically .",
    "the only curve where the gyrokinetic and the vlasov - maxwell solution agree for the whole range of wavevectors considered is for @xmath118 .",
    "the corresponding errors are shown in figures [ fig : error_ia_80 ] , [ fig : error_ia_85 ] , and [ fig : error_ia_89 ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice how the relative accuracy of the two models strongly depend on the wavevector .",
    "for instance , at @xmath119 the gyrokinetic solution is about two order of magnitudes more accurate than the hybrid for @xmath120 , but starts to become less accurate for @xmath121 . also , it is interesting that the hybrid solution errors decrease with increasing wavevector .",
    "that is , the model is more accurate in the dispersive regions of the curves .",
    "it is well - known that the fast mode solution is factored out from the gyrokinetic model . in this sense ,",
    "a comparison of gyrokinetics with the other the two models is meaningless . in figure",
    "[ fig : disp_rel_fw ] we compare the dispersion relations of the fully - kinetic , the hybrid , and the two - fluids models for @xmath106 , @xmath117 , @xmath108 .",
    "the dispersion relation for the latter follows the derivation of @xcite .",
    "the three solutions are in a very good agreement for the real frequency ( top panel ) , where a slight deviation with respect to the correct solution occurs only at large @xmath122 .",
    "interestingly , the two - fluids solution is a very good proxy for both hybrid and full - kinetic solutions , in this regime .",
    "the bottom panel shows the corresponding damping rate ( the two - fluids model is not shown since its solutions are always real ) . once again , as expected , the hybrid model underestimates the damping rates , although there is a certain regime , approximately for @xmath123 , where the red and blue curves have a good agreement .      in this section",
    "we perform the analysis of the error @xmath96 of eq .",
    "( [ eps_d ] ) . as we discussed above , in this regime",
    "the goal is not to compare the solutions for normal modes , but rather to provide a single measure of the error that captures the overall distance between the models in term of their pseudospectrum .",
    "this approach is justified by the non - normality of the linear operators , and by the fact that a multitude of modes appear in this regime , and it is not obvious why any of those should play a particular role in the plasma dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig : error_d ] shows the error @xmath96 for angles of propagation @xmath108 , @xmath124 , @xmath52 , and @xmath81 ( respectively in blue , red , yellow , and magenta ) .",
    "the solid lines are for the hybrid model , and the dashed lines for the gyrokinetic .",
    "a very interesting trend can be noticed .",
    "the errors for the gyrokinetic model have a sharp increase , of almost an order of magnitude , around @xmath125 , while the hybrid model error tend to increase for @xmath110 and to decrease for @xmath112 .",
    "overall , the hybrid model performs much better than the gyrokinetic .",
    "this is not surprising because , as it was already evident by inspection of figures [ fig : pseudo ] and [ fig : pseudo_k_1_85 ] , the gyrokinetic model simply misses many roots of the fully - kinetic dispersion relation .",
    "it is important to realize that the modes that are not captured by this model are not heavily - damped with respect to the modes that are captured ( but they have higher frequencies ) .",
    "one could argue that the error @xmath96 is defined and constructed in a rather arbitrary way .",
    "although this is certainly true , we think that it is still very informative on how much a reduced model is able to reproduce the correct linear evolution of the system .",
    "as we mentioned , the ability of gyrokinetics to describe solar wind turbulence in the regime @xmath126 has been stressed out in many recent papers @xcite .",
    "although this might certainly be true , we believe that it is informative to know what is left out from the model , in terms of normal modes . in figure [ fig : modes_contours ] we compare the three models ( fully - kinetic to the left , hybrid in the middle , gyrokinetic to the right ) for the case @xmath56 , and @xmath81 . here",
    ", we do not show the normal modes , but the curves @xmath36 ( black ) , and @xmath37 ( red ) in the domain @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the normal modes can be inferred as the points where black and red curves intersect .",
    "this figure reinforces what is well - known about the models : gyrokinetics factors out high - frequency modes ( irrespective of their damping rate ) , and the hybrid model does not properly damp some of the modes ( the ones that undergo electron landau damping ) .",
    "reduced kinetic models are extensively used in plasma physics , in lieu of the more complete vlasov - maxwell system . in this paper , we have compared the hybrid ( ion - kinetic and electron - fluid ) , the gyrokinetic , and the fully - kinetic models , for a wide range of wavevectors and propagation angles , in linear theory .",
    "we have chosen one test case with parameters relevant to the study of solar wind turbulence .",
    "we have compared both dispersion relations of single normal modes , for angles of propagation @xmath129 and pseudospectra , for @xmath130 .",
    "the latter method is justified by the multitude of modes that appear in the quasi - perpendicular case , which makes it non - trivial to identify which one plays a predominant role .",
    "it is important to remember that that the gyrokinetic model has been employed also outside its nominal range of validity ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we note that the vlasov - maxwell linear theory has recently been investigated by @xcite , for very oblique propagation angles .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "the hybrid solutions present a reasonable agreement with the vlasov - maxwell system across all propagation angles , the largest disagreement being for @xmath118 .",
    "interestingly , the errors decrease in the region when the waves resonate with ions , and the dispersion curves saturate",
    ". one major mismatch of the hybrid model happens for @xmath131 , where a clear matching of the hybrid aic and ia modes with the corresponding vlasov - maxwell modes is not possible due to branch switching .",
    "as expected the gyrokinetic model presents larger errors for angles of propagation less than @xmath132 , particularly for @xmath112 however , also for quasi - perpendicular propagation , the errors increase abruptly as soon as the waves become resonant with ions . in conclusion , it appears that the extension of the gyrokinetic model to the electron regime ( @xmath112 ) is not justified , for angles of propagation smaller than about @xmath10 .",
    "this is also apparent from looking at the analysis of the error based on the pseudospectra .",
    "indeed , it appears that the hybrid model should be preferred , for its ability to represent most of the normal modes ( certainly in the ion regime @xmath110 and , to a certain extent , in the electron regime as well ) .",
    "however , we notice that the spurious low value of damping rates of some hybrid solutions might result in numerical instabilities , due to the accumulation of energy that is not properly damped . in this respect ,",
    "a promising numerical approach consists in devising models that factor out langmuir oscillations , still retaining the fully - kinetic nature of the solution ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    ) and real frequency @xmath133 are on horizontal and vertical axis , respectively .",
