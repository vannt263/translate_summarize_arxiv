    "in 2006 february , a new class of neutron stars , the `` rotating radio transients '' ( rrats ) was reported ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "these 11 objects , characterized by repeated dispersed radio bursts , have periods ranging from 0.7 to 7 seconds and are located in the galactic plane at 2  7 kpc distances .",
    "their periods are longer than those of most normal radio pulsars and similar to those of the populations of x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ; see haberl  2007 for a review ) and magnetars ( see woods & thompson  2006 for a review ) .",
    "for the three sources with the highest pulse detection rates , period derivatives , @xmath6 , have been determined .",
    "if the measured @xmath6 values are interpreted as due to magnetic dipole spin - down , they imply characteristic ages and magnetic field strengths in the general range of the normal pulsar population .",
    "there have been several suggestions put forward on the nature of this new class of neutron star .",
    "one obvious suggestion is that the rrats are related to pulsars which emit `` giant pulses '' ( e.g. knight et al .",
    "however , the rrats with measured period derivatives do not appear to have high values of either magnetic field strength at the light cylinder or spin - down luminosity , both suggested as predictors of giant - pulse activity ( cognard et al .",
    "1996 ; knight et al . 2006 ) .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2006 ) suggest that the rrats may be neutron stars near the radio `` death line '' or may be related to `` nulling '' radio pulsars",
    ". however , the period derivatives measured for three rrats do not place them near canonical pulsar `` death lines '' ( e.g. chen & ruderman 1993 ) and , unlike most nulling pulsars ( e.g. wang et al . 2007 ) , we typically do not see more than one pulse from the rrats in succession .",
    "another intriguing possibility is that the sporadicity of the rrats is due to the presence of a circumstellar asteroid belt ( cordes & shannon 2006 ; li 2006 ) or a radiation belt such as seen in planetary magnetospheres ( luo & melrose 2007 ) . or , perhaps , they are transient x - ray magnetars , a particularly relevant suggestion given the recent detection by camilo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) of transient radio pulsations from the anomalous x - ray pulsar xte  j1810197 .",
    "a final possibility is that they are similar objects to psr  b0656 + 14 , one of three middle - aged pulsars ( i.e. `` the three musketeers '' ; becker & truemper 1997 ) from which pulsed high - energy emission has been detected ( e.g. deluca et al . 2005 ) .",
    "weltevrede et al .",
    "( 2006 ) convincingly show that if psr  b0656 + 14 were more distant its emission properties would appear similar to those of the rrats .",
    "determining the reason for the unusual emission of the rrats is important as population analyses show that their population may be up to several times greater than that of the normal radio pulsars ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "popov et al . ( 2006 ) show that the inferred birthrate of rrats is consistent with that of xdins but not with magnetars .",
    "while the radio emission properties of j18191458 are quite different from those of `` normal '' pulsars , it appears to be a rotating neutron star from which we detect radio pulses , and we henceforth give it the prefix `` psr '' .",
    "psr  j18191458 shows the brightest and most frequent radio bursts of any of the rrat sources .",
    "it has a 4.26-s period , relatively high inferred characteristic surface dipole magnetic field strength of @xmath0  g , characteristic age of 117  kyr , and spin - down luminosity of @xmath7  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "the distance inferred from its dispersion measure ( dm ) of 196@xmath8  pc  @xmath9 is 3.6  kpc ( cordes & lazio  2002 ) , with considerable ( at least 25% ) uncertainty .",
    "psr  j18191458 is characterized by radio bursts at 1.4  ghz of average duration 3  ms , with bursts arriving randomly with a mean rate of one every @xmath10  3  minutes .",
    "x - ray emission was detected from this source in a serendipitous 30-ks _ chandra _ acis - i observation toward the galactic supernova remnant g15.9 + 0.2 ( reynolds et al .",
    "they found that the spectrum was well described by an absorbed blackbody with neutral hydrogen column density @xmath11 @xmath3 and temperature @xmath12kev , with an absorbed flux of @xmath13ergs@xmath3s@xmath4 between 0.3 and 5 kev .",
    "these properties are consistent with emission from a cooling neutron star of age @xmath14  years , broadly consistent with the characteristic age of psr  j18191458 .",
    "no evidence for bursts or variability was found .",
    "the time resolution of these _ chandra _ observations was not sufficient to allow a robust search for x - ray pulsations .",
    "we were awarded 43  ks of _ xmm - newton _ time to further characterize the spectrum and search for pulsations .",
    "we report here on the results of these observations , in particular the detection of x - ray pulsations and a possible feature in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this is the first detection of x - ray pulsations from any of the rrat sources . in section  2",
    "we describe the observations and both the timing and spectral analyses . in section  3",
    "we discuss possible interpretations of our results , and present our conclusions in section  4 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations were performed on 2006 5 april , with a total observation time of 43  ks .",
    "the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn and mos instruments were operated with medium filters and in small window mode , providing a time resolution of 6 and 300  ms and effective livetimes of 71% and 97.5% , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas version 7.0.0 ) and the most recent calibration files .",
    "data from both the pn and mos instruments were used for the timing and spectral analyses .",
    "we also also analyzed the reflection grating spectrometer data but our target was too faint to be reliably detected .",
    "we filtered the observation for background flares , resulting in effective on - source exposure times of 32.5 and 37.8  ks ( 23.0 and 36.9  ks including deadtime ) for the pn and mos instruments , respectively .",
    "we detect a point source with j2000 coordinates : right ascension @xmath15 and declination @xmath16 ( 4@xmath17 error in each coordinate ) .",
    "this is consistent with the radio - timing - derived position and with the more accurate position for the x - ray counterpart published in reynolds et al .",
    "there is no evidence for extended emission , with the source brightness falling off as expected given the _",
    "xmm - newton _ point spread function .    for both pn and mos data",
    ", we extracted the source photons within a 20@xmath17 circular radius centered on the source position , which ensured extraction of more than 90% of the source counts .",
    "following standard practice , the size of the extraction region has not been corrected for in our final quoted fluxes and luminosities .",
    "the background counts were extracted from four 20@xmath17 circular regions centered on off - source positions ( different for the pn and mos instruments ) in the same central ccd .      for the timing analysis , we used all photons from pn and mos1 and mos2 instruments with pattern @xmath18 12 ( i.e. allowing for single , double , triple and quadruple events ) .",
    "this resulted in @xmath19 and @xmath20 source and background pn counts and @xmath21 and @xmath22 source and background mos1 plus mos2 counts ( normalized for a 20@xmath17 circular extraction region ) .",
    "although we can measure a period of 4.26  s from the arrival times of the radio bursts , the periodicity is not detectable in a fast fourier transform of the radio time series due to the sporadic nature of the source .",
    "we therefore performed a periodicity search of all pn and mos photons ( i.e. with energies 0.215  kev ) as a confirmation of the method through which the radio period was derived ( see mclaughlin et al .",
    "the arrival times were converted to the solar system barycenter and the @xmath23 test ( buccheri et al . 1983 ) was applied .",
    "the most significant signal is detected with @xmath24 at a frequency of @xmath25 mhz ( all errors are quoted at the 1@xmath26 confidence level ) . allowing for @xmath27 independent frequencies searched in the range 0.1100  hz , the probability of chance occurrence of this signal in the absence of a real pulsation would be @xmath28 , showing that the periodicity from this source would be easily detectable in a blind search of the x - ray photons .",
    "the ephemeris obtained through continued radio timing of psr  j18191458 with the parkes radio telescope at 1.4  ghz using the tempo software package predicts a barycentric frequency at the center of the observation ( mjd  53830.87029 ) of @xmath29  mhz , consistent with the measured x - ray frequency . accounting for spin - down during the observation is unimportant as the change in frequency due to the @xmath30  hz  s@xmath4 frequency derivative over the 12-hr observation is much less than the size of an individual frequency bin .",
    "the x - ray detection of periodicity shows that the radio - derived period is indeed the true period , and not a smaller common factor of the radio arrival times ( see mclaughlin et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in figure  1",
    ", we present the 0.35  kev background - corrected x - ray pulse profile formed by folding barycentered photons from the pn and both mos instruments using the radio ephemeris .",
    "the same good time interval file was used for the pn and both mos instruments and backgrounds were subtracted separately .",
    "the different exposure times for the two instruments were accounted for .",
    "we chose to restrict this analysis to 0.35  kev as below 0.3  kev , the pn and mos detectors are not well calibrated and , above 5  kev , the background dominates . in figure  1 , we also present the radio profile formed from adding individual bright radio pulses with the radio ephemeris .",
    "the x - ray pulse profile has a 0.35 kev background - corrected pulsed fraction of 34@xmath316% , defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the minimum and maximum values of the x - ray pulse profile .",
    "it can be well modeled as a single sinusoid with @xmath35 ( 17 d.o.f . ) .",
    "we find no significant dependence of pulsed fraction on energy , with a pulsed fraction at energies @xmath36  kev of 28@xmath37% and a pulsed fraction at energies from 15  kev of 49@xmath3110% .",
    "the peak of the x - ray profile , calculated by fitting a sinusoid , is at phase @xmath38 and is aligned to the peak of the radio profile at phase 0.5 .",
    "the 3  pc  @xmath9 uncertainty in the dm of 196  pc  @xmath9 amounts to a radio arrival time uncertainty at 1.4  ghz of only 13  ms , or 0.3% of the 4.26  s pulse period .",
    "our pn data can be used to place limits on the existence of x - ray bursts from the source . binning the data on various timescales to search for bursts of different widths we find no evidence for aperiodic variability on timescales ranging from 6  ms to the duration of our observation .",
    "we used photons with energies up to 10 kev , important given the hard spectra of magnetar bursts ( e.g. gavriil et al 2004 ) .",
    "omitting frames with high particle background , we find that none of the @xmath39 frames contains more than two counts within the 20@xmath17 region , with three frames containing exactly two counts .",
    "these numbers are entirely consistent with poisson statistics .",
    "the number of events in a single frame which would deviate from a steady flux at the 3-@xmath26 level is 3 photons .",
    "we therefore adopt this as the upper limit on the x - ray flux of any burst of width 6  ms or less . assuming a spectrum of the same shape as that fitted for the overall source ( column 2 of table  1 ; see section  2.2 ) limits the observed fluence of any burst to @xmath40  ergs  @xmath3 ( 0.35  kev ) , corresponding to an absorbed flux limit of @xmath41  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ( 0.35  kev ) if we assume that the x - ray burst would last for 3  ms , the width of the radio pulse .",
    "this is a factor of five better than the limits placed by reynolds et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . at a distance of 3.6  kpc",
    ", these limits correspond to a total energy of @xmath42  ergs and luminosity of @xmath43  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , any bursts , at least during the 12-hour duration of our observation , must contain much less energy than typical x - ray magnetar bursts ( e.g. woods & thompson 2006 ) if their spectra is indeed similar to that described in column 2 of table  1 .      for the spectral analysis , we used pn photons with pattern @xmath18 4 ( i.e. single and double events ) and mos1 and mos2 photons with pattern @xmath18 12 .",
    "source and background spectra were extracted from the same regions used for the timing analysis and the spectral response matrices were created with the sas mkrmf and mkarf tools , using the bad - pixel file built for our observation .",
    "the pn and mos spectra were only used in the 0.42kev energy range , a smaller range than that used for the timing analysis due to the greater dependence of spectral fitting on background spectra . in the spectral analysis we used both rebinned and unbinned spectra .",
    "spectra were rebinned for mos and pn by a factor of two so that the energy resolution was not oversampled by more than a factor of three ( using the specific response matrix built for this observation ) .",
    "furthermore , we rebinned in order to have at least 30 counts per bin so that we could use the @xmath44 statistic .",
    "we first modeled the pn spectrum .",
    "we tried several different models and found that a single component fit was not possible .",
    "fitting with a single absorbed blackbody ( as in reynolds et al .",
    "2006 ) , we found @xmath45@xmath3 and @xmath46kev with a @xmath47 ( see figure  2 ) , while for an absorbed powerlaw , we obtained @xmath48@xmath3 and @xmath49 with a @xmath502.1 ( both fits have 53 d.o.f ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the reynolds et al .",
    "( 2006 ) best - fit parameters ( 0.58  kev ) of @xmath11 @xmath3 and @xmath12kev ( for the absorbed blackbody model ) and @xmath51 ( for the power - law model ) .",
    "an inspection of the residuals revealed that our high @xmath52 values were due to the presence of strong spectral features around 1kev and a weaker one around 0.5kev .",
    "we carefully checked whether these features might be due to calibration issues , to our source and background extraction regions or to residual particle flares and/or particles hitting the detector .",
    "we reliably excluded all of these issues by studying in detail the _ xmm - newton _ calibration lines ( see figure  3 ) , extracting the source and background photons from several different regions and investigating the spectrum using only pattern = 0 counts ( i.e. only isolated events ) .",
    "however , we note that the 0.5kev feature is very close to the oxygen edge energy , and an overabundance of oxygen in the direction of the source could be responsible . to further investigate this possibility",
    ", we fit our spectrum with an absorbed blackbody model using three different photoelectric cross - sections , those of bauciska - church & mccammon ( 1992 , 1998 ) and of verner et .",
    "this was aimed at studying the dependence of the significance of our 0.5kev line on the chosen photoelectric cross - section , which drives the shape of the edge .",
    "we found that the residuals around 0.5kev remain in all cases , although less significantly if we use the verner et .",
    "1996 ) cross - section .",
    "for that reason , we assumed this cross - section for all our spectral fitting , and we omitted all photons in the 0.500.53  kev energy range ( two bins in our rebinned pn spectrum ) from our modeling .",
    "we tentatively conclude that this line is due to the oxygen edge , but only future deeper observations will unambiguously confirm this .",

    "we show the blackbody plus gaussian fit and residuals in figure  4 .",
    "note that there is evidence in the residuals for narrow lines within our broad 1 kev line , implying that the line may be a blending of narrower lines .",
    "however , the addition of several single narrow lines is not statistically significant , and future data with better statistics are necessary for investigating this issue .",
    "we ran monte carlo simulations of 2@xmath87 spectra ( see rea et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007 ) for details ) to estimate the significance of the spectral feature ( as suggested by protassov et al .",
    "the spectra were simulated using models corresponding to columns 2 and 4 from table 1 with the absorbed blackbody parameters varying within their 3@xmath26 errors ( see table1 ) , absorption line parameters completely free to vary , and fixing the number of counts of each spectra at the pn count value for psrj18191458 .",
    "after having generated 10@xmath88 spectra for each of the two models , we counted how many of these simulated spectra showed an absorption feature at any energy , width or depth , only due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "none of the simulated spectra presented a gaussian absorption line at any energy or width with a depth @xmath89 , and no cyclotron component was detected with a depth @xmath90 for any energy or width .",
    "we therefore infer the significance of the line at 1kev to be @xmath91 , corresponding to a @xmath92 99.99% probability ( i.e. at least 4@xmath26 ) that this line is not due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "to check whether the line was also present in the mos data , we simultaneously fit the pn and both mos1 and mos2 rebinned spectra ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "all models in table  1 fit the pn , mos1 and mos2 data well .",
    "however , because of the lower number of mos counts , our 1  kev line was not significant in the mos spectra , especially because the rebinning we did in order to use the @xmath44 statistic left only a handful of bins within the line .",
    "as a further check , we then used the unbinned pn and mos spectra and the c - statistic ( cash 1979 ) to assess the goodness of an absorbed blackbody fit , without the inclusion of any line .",
    "we found that for @xmath93@xmath3 and @xmath94kev , the c - statistic is 1009.776 using 969 pha bins .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the fit showed that the probability of having a c - statistic @xmath95 1010 is 98.0% .",
    "note that only if the c - statistic probability is smaller then 50% can the model be accepted .",
    "this shows that an absorbed blackbody model alone can not reproduce the data , and hence that a line is also present in the mos spectra .",
    "we show in figure5 the pn , mos1 and mos2 spectra modeled with an absorbed blackbody plus a gaussian ( column 2 in table1 ) , with a more severe pn rebinning ( with at least 40 counts per bin ) , to show the agreement between the three instruments .",
    "note that all the models in table  1 satisfactorily fit the previous _ chandra _ data ( reynolds et al .",
    "2006 ) , although the absorption line is not statistically significant in those data because of the reduced number of counts .",
    "furthermore , we checked whether the spectral feature parameters and significance were dependent on the spectral binning or on the continuum model .",
    "we found that the spectral feature does not vary significantly when we vary the amount of spectral binning ( see also figure5 ) , but that it is rather dependent on the chosen continuum ( as is generally the case for every spectral feature ) .",
    "in fact , if instead of a blackbody model , we assume a power  law continuum , the feature is still detectable with similar spectral properties but at a lower significance of 98.9% ( roughly 2.5@xmath26 ) .",
    "hence , if we assume a blackbody continuum model ( reasonable for an isolated neutron star ) we can show with high confidence that a spectral feature is present in our data .",
    "however , our statistics do not allow us to statistically prefer one model to the others and reliably ascertain its nature .",
    "furthermore , if future , more sensitive observations reveal a different source continuum , the significance of the feature may need to be revised .",
    "we also performed phase - resolved spectroscopy over two intervals of 0.5 in phase centered on the peak and the minimum of the pulse profile , respectively .",
    "we did not find any significant spectral variability between these two phase intervals at the 2@xmath26 level .",
    "however the low number of counts in each spectrum does not allow us to reach any reliable conclusions about the pulse - phase dependence of the spectral parameters .",
    "if we accept that the spectral feature is significant , the two main possible interpretations are as an atomic line or as a cyclotron resonant scattering line",
    ".    if the line is atomic , then it could be due either to the neutron star atmosphere or , but less probably , to a peculiar abundances in the ism in that direction ( or perhaps even a combination of the two ) . at 1kev",
    ", it might then be due to the n edge ( although improbable given its low abundance ) , ne edge ( around 0.9  kev ) , ne xi k - edge ( at 1.19kev ) , or some fe - l lines , including fe xx , fe xxi and fe xxii or fe xxiii ( all around 0.9kev ) .",
    "note that fe lines are common in other kinds of neutron stars , though mostly coming from accretion disks in binary systems rather than from the neutron stars themselves ( see e.g. cottam et al .",
    "the structure present in the residuals ( see figure  4 middle panel ) , which in our data is not significant , might be due to a blending of narrow lines which we could only model with a broad line due to our limited number of counts",
    ".    if the feature is due to proton cyclotron resonant scattering , the magnetic field inferred would be @xmath96 g , where @xmath97 is the gravitational redshift factor ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the neutron star mass and radius , respectively ) .",
    "assuming canonical values for @xmath98 and @xmath99 of 1.4  @xmath100 and 10  km , we find @xmath101  g. this is slightly higher than the dipolar surface magnetic field inferred through radio timing through the standard formula @xmath102  g. however , this expression can be considered an order - of - magnitude estimate as it assumes a purely dipolar field , a neutron star radius of 10  km , a moment of inertia of @xmath103  g  @xmath104 and an angle between the spin and magnetic axes @xmath105  degrees .",
    "accounting for this and assuming @xmath106  degrees would make the timing- and cyclotron - inferred fields consistent .",
    "in addition , the width and depth of the line are consistent with the predictions of zane et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for proton - cyclotron absorption in highly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "we can not detect any harmonics to the fundamental cyclotron line because our spectrum is background dominated above 2kev .",

    "2004 ) and investigated for isolated neutron stars by liu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in some cases the first harmonic is as deep as the fundamental cyclotron frequency .",
    "therefore , it is possible , although unlikely , that the 1kev feature is the first harmonic , with the 0.5  kev fundamental coincident with the depression in the spectrum that we have interpreted as due to an overabundance of oxygen .",
    "we note that the observed lines are unlikely to be due to electron - cyclotron absorption as the inferred magnetic field would be a factor of 2000 lower ( i.e. the ratio of the proton to electron mass ) and incompatible with that measured through radio timing .",

    "( 2003 ) attributed these lines to electron - cyclotron absorption .",

    "simulations show that a 100-ks observation would allow us to achieve both of these goals . because the strength of the cyclotron line depends on the angle between the observer and the magnetic field , we expect phase variation of cyclotron features",
