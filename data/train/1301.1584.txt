    "in this paper we study the following boundary value problem .",
    "let @xmath4 be an open bounded domain with a lipschitz boundary @xmath5 , we consider the dirichlet problem @xmath6 ^ 2 & x\\in \\omega\\\\ u(x)=g(x ) & x\\in \\partial \\omega \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath7 are given functions .",
    "we focus to the fact that the function @xmath2 is borel measurable , possibly discontinuous .    in the most classical case ,",
    "the matrix @xmath8 is the identity matrix and @xmath2 is a positive function , so the partial differential equation in ( [ ek ] ) reduces to @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath2 has the meaning of the refraction index of the media where the light rays are passing .",
    "typically , the refraction law applies across surfaces of discontinuity of @xmath2 . +",
    "another example is offered by a classical problem in computer vision , the shape - from - shading model . in this classical inverse problem",
    "we come up with the equation @xmath11 if we assume that the light source is vertical and at infinity ( so all the rays are parallel ) and the object to reconstruct is the graph of the unknown function @xmath12 . in this particular case the brightness @xmath13 $ ] , i.e. the intensity of light reflected by the object , can be discontinuous when the object has edges as we will see in more details at the end of this paper . using classical tools of convex analysis",
    ", both equations above can be rewritten in the form ( [ ek ] ) .",
    "another motivation to deal with discontinuous hamiltonians comes directly from control theory . in this framework",
    "discontinuous functions can be used to represent targets ( for example using @xmath2 as a characteristic function ) and/or state constraints ( using @xmath2 as an indicator function ) @xcite .",
    "clearly , the well - posedness of ( [ ek ] ) in the case of continuous @xmath2 follows from the theory of viscosity solutions for hj equations , the interested reader can find the details in @xcite and @xcite where there are summarized the well - known results introduced by crandall , lions , ishii and other authors .",
    "it is interesting to point out that , when the hamiltonian is discontinuous , the knowledge of @xmath2 at every point will not guarantee the well - posedness of the problem even in the framework of viscosity solutions .",
    "in fact , for equation ( [ ek ] ) it can be easily observed that , even when @xmath2 is defined point wise and has appropriate discontinuities , the value function for the corresponding control problem will not satisfy the equation in the viscosity sense . in order to define viscosity solutions for this case , we use appropriate semicontinuous envelopes of @xmath2 , following some ideas introduced by ishii in @xcite .",
    "the notion of viscosity solution in the case of discontinuous hamiltonian was proposed by ishii in @xcite where he presents some existence and regularity results .",
    "other results of well - posedness of hamilton - jacobi equations in presence of discontinuous coefficients are been presented by various authors in several works ( see @xcite ) and in the specific case , present in many applications , of the eikonal equation @xcite .",
    "our primary goal is to prove convergence for a semi - lagrangian scheme which has shown to be rather effective in the approximation of hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations .",
    "the results which have been proved for this type of schemes work for convex and non convex hamiltonians but use the uniform continuity of the hamitonian .",
    "moreover , the typical convergence result is given for the @xmath14 norm which is rather natural when dealing with classical viscosity solutions ( see e.g. the result by crandall and lions @xcite , barles and souganidis @xcite and the monograph by falcone and ferretti @xcite ) .",
    "for classical viscosity solutions , at our knowledge , the only two convergence results in @xmath3 has been proved by lin and tadmor @xcite for a central finite difference scheme and by bokanowwsky et al .",
    "@xcite in dimension one .",
    "we have also to mention the level set approach for discontinuous solutions proposed by tsai et al . @xcite .",
    "although classical schemes tailored for the the approximation of regular cases with convex hamiltonians can give reasonable results also for some discontinuous hamiltonians , it would be interesting to have a theoretical results in this situation .",
    "deckelnick and elliott @xcite have studied a problem where the solution is still lipschitz continuous although the hamiltonian is discontinuous . in particular , they have proposed a finite difference scheme for the approximation of ( [ ek2 ] ) and their scheme is very similar to a finite difference schemes usually applied for regular hamiltonians .",
    "their contribution is interesting because they prove an _ a - priori _ error estimate in @xmath15 .",
    "although our work has been also inspired by their results , we use different techniques and our analysis is devoted to a scheme of semi  lagrangian type",
    ". the benefits of a semi  lagrangian scheme with respect to a finite differences scheme are a better ability to follow the informations driven by the characteristics , the fact that one can use a larger time - step in evolutive problems still having stability and the fact that sl - schemes do not require a structured grid .",
    "this peculiarities give us a faster and more accurate approximation in many cases as it has been reported in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite or appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "it is also important to note that we prove an _ a - priori _ error estimate which improves the result in @xcite because we consider a more general case ( [ ek ] ) where also discontinuous viscosity solutions are accepted .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "+ in section [ sec : teo ] we recall some definitions and theoretical results available for discontinuous hamiltonian . section [ sec : semiapprox ] is devoted to the presentation of the scheme and to the proof of some properties which will be used in the proof of convergence . in section [ sec : conv ] we prove convergence and establish an _ a - priori _ error estimate giving the rate of convergence in the @xmath3 norm . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : tests ] we present our numerical experiments dealing with control and image processing problems .",
    "we present , for readers convenience , some results of well - posedness mainly taken from a work of soravia @xcite .",
    "we also introduce our assumptions , which are summarized below .    the boundary data @xmath16 the matrix of the coefficients satisfies @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "then @xmath8 is a symmetric , positive semidefinite and possibly degenerate matrix , @xmath21 moreover , the function @xmath22 , @xmath23 is borel measurable and possibly discontinuous .    we can give an optimal control interpretation of ( [ ek ] ) , rewriting the differential operator in the following form @xmath24 where the columns of the matrix @xmath25 are the vector fields which will be denoted by @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we define @xmath28 . in this way",
    "the eikonal equation ( [ ek ] ) becomes , for @xmath29 , the following bellman equation @xmath30 associated to the symmetric controlled dynamics @xmath31 where the measurable functions @xmath32 are the controls .",
    "we will denote in the sequel by @xmath33 the solutions of . in this system , optimal trajectories are the geodesics associated to the metric defined by the matrix @xmath8 , and they are straight lines when @xmath8 is the identity matrix .",

    "let us introduce the concept of _ discontinuous viscosity solution _ for ( [ ek ] ) introduced by ishii in @xcite .",

    "the study of the shape - from - shading problem started in the 70s ( see @xcite and references therein ) and since then a huge number of papers have appeared on this subject .",
    "more recently , the mathematical community was interested in shape - from - shading since its formulation is based on a first order partial differential equation of hamilton - jacobi type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the equation related to this problem is the following : for a brightness function @xmath276 $ ] , in the case of vertical light source is vertical , to reconstruct the unknown surface , we need to solve @xmath277 points @xmath278 where @xmath279 is maximal ( i.e. equal to 1 ) correspond to the particular situation when the light direction and @xmath280 are parallel .",
    "these points are usually called `` singular points '' and , if they exist , equation is said to be degenerate .",
    "the notion of singular points is strictly related to that of concave / convex ambiguity , we refer to @xcite for details on this point .",
    "it is important to note that , whatever the final equation is , in order to compute a solution we will have to impose some boundary conditions on @xmath5 and/or inside @xmath36 .",
    "a natural choice is to consider dirichlet type boundary conditions in order to take into account at least two different possibilities .",
    "the first corresponds to the assumption that the surface is standing on a flat background , i.e. we set @xmath281 for @xmath282 .",
    "the second possibility occurs when the height of the surface on the boundary ( _ silhouette _ ) is known : @xmath283 for @xmath284 .",
    "the above boundary conditions are widely used in the literature although they are often unrealistic since they assume a previous knowledge of the surface .      *",
    "we note that a digital image is always a discontinuous datum .",
    "is is a piecewise constant function with a fixed measure of his domain of regularity ( pixel ) .",
    "so this is the interest of our analysis for discontinuous cases of @xmath2 .",
    "* in the case of maximal gray tone ( @xmath285 ) , we are not in the hypothesis introduced previously .",
    "in particular we have that @xmath286 in some points .",
    "we overcome this difficulty , as suggest in @xcite .",
    "we regularize the problem making a truncation of @xmath2 .",
    "it is possible to show that this regularized problem goes to the maximal subsolution of the problem with @xmath287 . and that this particular solution is the correct one from the applicative point of view .",
    "we firstly consider a simple problem in 1d to point out an aspect of the model .",
    "let the function @xmath279 be @xmath288 we can see that we have a discontinuity on @xmath289 ; despite this , because of the non degeneracy of the dynamics , the solution will be continuous .",
    "for this reason we can see that changing the boundary condition of the problem , the solution will be the maximal lipschitz solution that verifies continuously the boundary condition .",
    "to see this we have solved this simple monodimensional problem with various dirichlet condition , in particular we require @xmath290 , and @xmath291 . with @xmath292 and @xmath293 , we obtain the results shown in figure [ 5:testbound ] .",
    "we can realize , in this way , an intrinsic limit of the model .",
    "it can not represent an object with discontinuities .",
    "we make another example that is more complicated and more close to a real application .",
    "we consider a simplified sfs - datum for the basilica of saint paul outside the walls in rome , as shown in figure [ 5:sanpaolo ] .",
    "we have not the correct boundary value on the silhouette of the image and on the discontinuities , so we impose simply @xmath294 on the boundary . computing the equation with @xmath295",
    "we get the solution described on figure [ 5:sp1 ] .",
    "we can see that , although the main features of the shape as the slope of the roofs , the points of maximum are well reconstructed . despite it ,",
    "the shape which we get is not so close to our expectations .",
    "we can try to get better results adding the correct height of the surface along the silhouette as discussed above and , in this case , we get the solution shown on figure [ 5:sp2 ] . we can notice a more convincing shape , but also in this case it is quite not satisfactory .",
    "for example we have that the correct boundary conditions we imposed are not attained , and we create some discontinuity on some parts of them .",
    "this is due to the fact that they can be not compatible with the statement of the problem .",
    "essentially the limit which we can see , as described above , is that we can not have discontinuity on the viscosity solution ( theorem [ lipreg ] ) .",
    "we propose a different model for this problem , which allows discontinuous solutions . at this point",
    "we do not care about the physical interpretation of it , instead we are trying to find a solution closer to the correct solution .",
    "we want to solve the equation @xmath296 with the map @xmath297 is @xmath298 where @xmath299 is a tuning parameter .",
    "obviously this choice of the anisotropic evaluator @xmath88 is a bit trivial .",
    "this pick is done for the sake of simplicity .",
    "more complicated proposal can be found for example in @xcite .    in this way we use the results about the degeneracy of the dynamics permitting to the viscosity solution to be discontinuous .",
    "of course this is , in some sense , the opposite situation with respect to the classical formulation : in this case every non smooth point of the surface is interpreted as discontinuity and we try to reconstruct it using the data coming from the silhouette .",
