    "<S> it is shown that there are disagreements between these two approaches at @xmath98 and @xmath104 which can be explained by large contribution of power corrections at high @xmath8 in the case of three - points sum rule and by contribution of higher twist operators at respectively small @xmath8 in the case of light - cone sum rules .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain that vector dominance does not work in the process . </S>",
    "<S> if we try to fit the form factors by @xmath105 and @xmath106-mesons then we find that @xmath106-meson contribution is dominant at @xmath96 , and we can not use vector dominance to estimate @xmath107-coupling constant .    it is shown that at @xmath108 form factor @xmath49 increases with growth of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour can be explained in framework of naive quark model , where @xmath2-meson is consist of two quarks in @xmath109-wave .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that it will be very interesting to measure @xmath49 form factor at @xmath69 because here we have a very weak dependence on the form of pion wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the form factor gives additional information on the function . </S>",
