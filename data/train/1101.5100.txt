    "the radio pulsar , discovered in the parkes southern pulsar survey @xcite , stands out among the nearly 2000 radio pulsars catalogued so far for several reasons .",
    "its spin period ( @xmath0 ) of 8.51 s is the longest of any known radio pulsars .",
    "the rotation parameters of  are such that its radio emission is surprising : its period and period derivative ( @xmath8 s s@xmath2 , corrected for the ` shklovskii effect ' ; @xcite ) values locate  in the @xmath0@xmath9 diagram below most proposed ` death lines ' ( e.g. @xcite ) , where the accelerating potential is below the minimum value required to produce pair cascades and thus radio emission .",
    "its radio emission has been explained either by proposing new models for pair production in the magnetosphere @xcite or by suggesting that strong multipolar surface magnetic fields are present in all radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "has one of the largest characteristic ages ( @xmath10 years ) among non - recycled radio pulsars and the lowest rotational energy loss ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath2 , where @xmath12 g @xmath13 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star ) of any pulsar .",
    "the magnetic field , computed assuming magnetodipolar spin - down , is @xmath14 g , which instead is close to the average value for non - recycled radio pulsars .    a very faint object at radio wavelengths ( apparent luminosity of @xmath1520 @xmath16jy kpc@xmath17 at 1400 mhz ; @xcite ) ,",
    "could be detected thanks to its small distance , only @xmath15180 pc as inferred from a dispersion measure of 3.35 @xmath18 pc assuming the galactic free electron density model of @xcite .",
    "this led @xcite to propose that  could be the tip of the iceberg of a huge population of galactic long - period and low - luminosity pulsars , very difficult to detect but comparable in number to previous estimates of the total pulsar population of the galaxy .",

    "observed  for about 40 ks on 2009 october 24 .",
    "since the aim of the observation was the search for x - ray emission from the pulsar , only the data collected by the epic instrument , composed by three imaging detectors sensitive in the 0.215 kev energy range , were analysed .",
    "the epic pn camera @xcite was operated in full frame mode , while the two epic mos units @xcite were operated in large window mode .",
    "the thin optical blocking filter was used for the three epic cameras .",
    "all the data were processed using the  science analysis software ( sas version 9.0.0 ) . to improve the sensitivity at the lowest energy , where thermal emission from  is more likely to be detectable",
    ", the pn data were further processed using the sas tool epreject , which substantially reduces the low energy instrumental background due to electronic noise .",
    "the standard pattern selection criteria for the epic x  ray events ( patterns 04 for pn and 012 for mos ) were adopted . after filtering out",
    "the time intervals affected by a high level of particle background , the net exposure times were 22 ks for the pn and 26 ks for the mos .    a blind search for x - ray emission from",
    "was performed using different source detection algorithms in many energy bands , but no source compatible with the pulsar position was detected .",
    "the closest x - ray source is @xmath22 arcsec away from the proper - motion - corrected position of  ( @xcite , see figure  [ ximage ] ) , while the absolute astrometry of the epic images is @xmath151 arcsec ( root mean square , rms ) .    in order to set an upper limit on the pulsar x - ray emission , we selected the events from a 10 arcsec radius circular region centred at the position of , obtaining , in the 0.210 kev energy range , 40 and 21 counts in the pn and in the two mos cameras summed together , respectively ( see table  [ xlimits ] for other energy bands ) . to better characterise the background intensity in different energy bands , we extracted for each camera the background events from a larger source - free region in the same chip , deriving the estimates reported in table  [ xlimits ] for the number of background events expected in the source region . taking into account these background estimates and the poissonian fluctuations @xcite of the counts extracted from the region of",
    ", we obtain the 3@xmath23 upper limits on the pulsar count rate in different energy bands reported in table  [ xlimits ] . the conversion from count rates to fluxes for each detector",
    "is performed by assuming different spectral models ( see section 4 ) within the xspec ( version 11.3.1 ) spectral fitting software and using the response matrices and ancillary files produced by the sas software for a 10 arcsec circular region centred at the pulsar position .    .the",
    "3@xmath23 upper limits on the  count rates in different energy bands in the pn and the sum of the two mos cameras ( last column ) .",

    "we positioned the pulsar in the upper ccd chip to exploit its larger effective sky coverage ( @xmath27 arcmin@xmath17 ) .",

    "a few bright stars located relatively close to the pulsar position were masked to avoid ghost images and saturation spikes .",
    "we performed three sequences of five 590 s exposures each for a total integration time of 8850 s through both the @xmath28 and @xmath7 filters and a sequence of five 590 s exposures through the @xmath33 filter ( 2950 s integration time ) in dark time , photometric sky conditions , and average air masses of @xmath151.05 , @xmath151.14 , and @xmath151.29 in the @xmath28 , @xmath7 , and @xmath33 filters , respectively .",

    "however , we could use as a reference the average extinction coefficients computed for the e2v detector mounted at _",

    "we have then re - computed the astrometric solution of the  image , using as a reference objects selected from the guide star catalogue 2 ( gsc-2 ; @xcite ) . after accounting for the rms of the astrometric fit ( @xmath38 arcsec ) , the uncertainty of the registration of the  image on the gsc-2 reference frame ( @xmath39 arcsec ) , and the 0.15 arcsec uncertainty on the link of the gsc-2 to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf )",

    "[ oimage ] , overlaid on the co - added   @xmath7-band image .",
    "as seen , the pulsar position falls close to a rather bright source which is also detected in the @xmath28 and @xmath33-band images .",
    "its coordinates , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , imply an offset of @xmath44 arcsec from the computed pulsar position at the epoch of our  observations , i.e. 7 times larger than the overall uncertainty of our astrometric solution .",
    "thus , we can safely rule out that this object is associated to the pulsar .",

    "its colours suggest that the object ( object a ) might be a background star , or , more likely , a galaxy , as suggested by its somewhat patchy morphology .",
    "we could not detect any other object close to the pulsar radio position in any of the  @xmath28 , @xmath7 , and @xmath33-band images .",
    "the estimate of the upper limit is complicated by wings of object a s psf which extend at the pulsar radio position .",
    "the possible extended nature of such object does not allow us to perform simple psf subtraction .",
    "thus , we used a different approach .",
    "we simulated a point source ( modelled as a gaussian , with a fwhm equal to the value measured for non - extended objects on our final coadded images ) , subtracted it at the expected pulsar position , and estimated the resulting residuals on the image in an aperture with a diameter equal to the fwhm .",
    "such an exercise was repeated using increasing values for the magnitude of the simulated source , until residuals were consistent with a @xmath48 negative fluctuation . after correcting for atmospheric extinction , the resulting upper limits to the emission of psr j2144@xmath493933 are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "being the closest isolated radio pulsar currently known , its non - detection in our deep  and  observations sets robust upper limits on its x - ray and optical luminosity .",
    "thanks to the high sensitivity of the  pn instrument in the soft x - ray band , the best constraints on the thermal emission from  can be obtained from the pn data in the 0.20.5 kev band ( see table  [ xlimits ] and fig .

    "however , the neutron star temperature is not expected to be uniform , with the magnetic poles hotter than the rest of the surface .",
    "the radius of the polar cap can be estimated as @xmath57 m , where @xmath58 km is the neutron star radius and @xmath59 s is the pulse period .",
    "significantly smaller emitting regions are expected , e.g. , in the partially screened gap model @xcite and possibly observed in the thermal emission of old pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . assuming a 10 m radius polar cap",

    "our non - detection therefore implies a polar cap efficiency @xmath63 , not particularly constraining considering that efficiencies @xmath61 per cent are typically observed in rotation - powered pulsars . on the other hand ,",
    "much larger hot spots are inferred from the x - ray spectra of isolated neutron stars possibly heated by magnetic field decay @xcite , which might be related to  ( see below ) .",

    "[ sed ] shows how the constraints derived from the _ euve _ data strongly depend on the interstellar absorption , while the presumably low absorption and extinction towards this nearby pulsar has no impact in the x - ray and optical band .",

    "[ sed ] , these limits are well above the hottest blackbody compatible with the  data .",
    "our limit of @xmath3 k is among the lowest currently available for the surface temperature of a neutron star . considering typical cooling models ( see @xcite for a review ) and",

    "period derivative diagram suggests a possible non - standard evolution and thus a more complex cooling history .",
    "for example , this long period pulsar might be the descendant of a magnetar , i.e. a neutron star powered by the decay of its internal magnetic field of 10@xmath78 g ( see @xcite for a review ) . in this hypothesis ,",
    "the initially stronger magnetic field would have slowed down the neutron star cooling @xcite and , at the same time , the field decay would have heated up the neutron star surface either through joule heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) or possible magnetar - like bursting episodes . moreover , in case of field decay ,  would be much younger than its characteristic age , which largely overestimates the pulsar age when the magnetic field decreases with time .",
    "this possibility is apparently precluded by the low dipolar magnetic field of  ( @xmath79 g ) , since numerical simulations of magnetic field decay in neutron stars have shown that the field decay should virtually stop at a field intensity of @xmath1523@xmath2510@xmath80 g @xcite .",
    "however , the recent discovery of a transient x - ray source with timing parameters similar to those of  ( @xmath0=9.1 s , @xmath9@xmath6@xmath81 s s@xmath2 , and thus a dipolar magnetic field @xmath7@xmath6@xmath82 g ) showing magnetar - like activity indicates that a strong internal magnetic field might power the high energy emission of isolated neutron stars with dipolar magnetic fields well below 10@xmath80 g @xcite .",
    "the x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdinss , see @xcite for a review ) , which are nearby neutron stars with similarly long pulsation periods and surface temperatures of 512@xmath2510@xmath83 k , have also been suggested to be aged magnetars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . when a period derivative has been measured , characteristic ages of 14@xmath2510@xmath84 years and dipolar magnetic fields of 13@xmath2510@xmath80 g have been derived .",
    "although our non - detection of  can not exclude the possibility that this radio pulsar was born as a magnetar , it indicates that , in this scenario , it would be older than the xdinss , as already suggested by its lower dipolar magnetic field and longer characteristic age .    being the radio pulsar with the lowest rotational energy loss , the search for non - thermal emission from this object is challenging as well . assuming a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath85 ( see the lowermost panel of figure  [ sed ] ) ,",
    "we can derive a 3@xmath23 upper limit on the 0.52 kev observed flux of @xmath86 erg @xmath54 s@xmath2 from the pn data and @xmath87 erg @xmath54 s@xmath2 from the combined data of the two mos units .",
    "the upper limit on the pulsar non - thermal luminosity in the 0.52 kev energy range is @xmath88 erg s@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath1530 per cent of its rotational energy loss .",
    "this limit is not particularly constraining , since the efficiency to convert pulsar spin - down power into x - ray luminosity is observed to be typically much lower @xcite .",
    "the   @xmath7-band upper limit corresponds to a luminosity @xmath89 erg s@xmath2 , which is @xmath902 per cent of the spin - down luminosity .",
    "this is about 4 orders of magnitude above the rotation - powered optical emission efficiency of pulsars with comparable spin - down age .",
    "for instance the old pulsars psr b1929 + 10 ( @xmath91 years ) and psr b0950 + 08 ( @xmath92 years ) have optical emission efficiencies of @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite , respectively .    to improve the _ xmm - newton _ temperature upper limit by a factor of @xmath95 , optical observations deeper by at least @xmath96 magnitudes would be required .",
    "although these observations are within reach of the , they are complicated by the presence of object a , @xmath44 arcsec away from the pulsar position .",
    "this would require an image quality much better than 0.8 arcsec , which is challenging for ground - based optical observations .",
    "a substantial improvement in sensitivity to surface thermal emission from  can instead be obtained with near - uv observations with the _ hst _ , which , apart from having a much better angular resolution , would take advantage from a more favorable waveband , around the peak of a @xmath97@xmath610@xmath83 k blackbody spectrum .",
    "considering that  is a nearby neutron star and that object a is a relatively bright ( @xmath7=23.8 ) background source ( probably a galaxy ) , their small angular separation might cause a detectable gravitational lensing effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the displacement ( or deformation , being the object slightly extended ) of the background source due to the gravitational field of a point - like mass is expected to be @xcite    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the einstein ring radius and @xmath100 is its angular distance from the lens .",
    "in the approximation of a very distant lensed object , the einstein radius for a lens with mass @xmath101 at a distance @xmath102 is    @xmath103    although the proximity of  ( @xmath104 pc ) and its relatively small angular separation from object a ( @xmath105 arcsec ) make it the most favorable case for any known neutron star , for a mass of 1.4 @xmath55 a displacement of only @xmath106 mas is expected . given the large and well constrained proper motion of , two precise measurements of the galaxy apparent position in different epochs would be enough to measure its displacement and therefore to obtain a measure of the neutron star mass .",
    "unfortunately , the astrometric precision of currently available optical instruments is not adequate for such a measurement . in the future , a sufficient angular resolution might be reachable , but this measure will not be possible anymore because the direction of the pulsar proper motion , which is opposite to the background object position and is not going to intercept any other bright source in the next decades ( see fig .",
    "[ oimage ] ) , will make the required precision rapidly increasing with time .",
    "together with the other nearby neutron stars with a well determined proper motion ,  is anyway a good candidate for the measure of a neutron star mass through microlensing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , deeper observations , for example with the _ hst _ or the forthcoming _ jwst _ , might find dimmer sources along its sky trajectory , which , observed at their closest approach to the pulsar , might either show a displacement or a flux increase .",
    "this measurements would be less challenging in the case of  than for the other nearby neutron stars , thanks to its vanishing flux outside the radio band .",
