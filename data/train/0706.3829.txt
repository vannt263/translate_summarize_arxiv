    "recent imaging studies of the disks of s0 and spiral galaxies have demonstrated that not all stellar disks have simple exponential surface - brightness profiles ( e.g. , erwin , beckman , & pohlen 2005 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; erwin , pohlen , & beckman 2007 ) . instead , disk profiles appear to fall into three general categories : single - exponential @xcite type i ; freeman type ii , with a shallow inner slope and a steeper outer slope ( including so - called `` truncations '' ) ; and type iii ( `` antitruncations '' ) , with a steep inner slope and a shallow outer slope @xcite .",
    "see pohlen et al .",
    "( this volume ) for more background and illustrations of the three types .",
    "we report here on analysis of a deep imaging study of lenticulars and early - type spirals ( hubble types s0sb ) , focused on tracing the outer disk structure using azimuthally averaged surface - brightness profiles .",
    "the analysis of the barred - galaxy subsample ( 66 galaxies ) is complete @xcite ; analysis of the 45 _ unbarred _ galaxies is nearly complete ( see aladro et al . , this volume ) .",
    "pohlen et al .",
    "( this volume ) discuss the general trend of these disk types versus hubble type , including the complementary late - type sample of @xcite ; here , we highlight what we can learn about profiles in the earlier types and their connections to bars and galaxy environment .",
    "for barred galaxies , we can use the size of the bar as a measuring rod .",
    "type ii profiles ( downward - bending broken exponentials ) fall into two fairly distinct categories : those with the break inside the bar ( type ii.i ) and those with the break outside ( type ii.o ) .",
    "the first category is rare ( 6% of the barred galaxies ) , but does match profiles of some @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we suspect that this is a side - effect of the bar formation process .",
    "type ii.o profiles are much more common ( 42% of barred galaxies ) , but more difficult to explain .",
    "one possibility is `` truncations '' due to a threshold in star formation .",
    "@xcite recently showed that such thresholds could produce broken - exponential type ii profiles .",
    "however , the threshold ( gas ) surface densities predicted by such models ( e.g. , 310 @xmath1 pc@xmath2 in @xcite 2004 ) are quite low .",
    "while this is plausibly consistent with some breaks in late - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the surface brightnesses at the break radius which we observe correspond to stellar mass densities which an order of magnitude or more higher : 202000 @xmath1 pc@xmath2 ( median @xmath3 pc@xmath2 ) .",
    "one potential clue is that we often find outer rings in type ii.o galaxies with the ring located at or very close to the break ( figure  [ fig : type2olr - vs - ct ] ) .",
    "since outer rings are well understood as an effect of a bar s outer lindblad resonance ( olr ; see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we suspect that these breaks are a related phenomenon . supporting evidence comes from recent @xmath0-body simulations by @xcite , who found that type ii.o profiles could form at the olr of a bar - driven spiral .",
    "this leads us to suggest that the breaks in most type ii.o profiles are olr - related , and we refer to these as `` type ii.o - olr '' profiles .",
    "-band image ; for ngc  2950 , we have subtracted a model of the outer disk from the sdss image in order to bring out the ( faint ) outer pseudo - ring . [",
    "fig : type2olr - vs - ct ] ]    figure  [ fig : histogram ] demonstrates that the break radii in our type ii.o profiles follow the same size distribution ( break radius in terms of bar radius ) as the outer rings in our sample , as well as the outer rings in the sample of @xcite .",
    "a handful of galaxies have breaks at larger radii ( @xmath4 )  corresponding to low stellar mass densities  which suggests that the star - formation threshold mechanism might be at work in these galaxies , instead of an olr - related mechanism .",
    "figure  [ fig : type2olr - vs - ct ] shows one galaxy where this may be the case : the break is located well _ outside _ the bar s outer ring , and is thus _ not _ connected with the olr .",
    "we label such profiles `` classical truncations '' ( type ii.o - ct ) .    ]",
    "note that the ct profiles are rare in the early type galaxies ( 5% of the barred galaxies , 27% of the unbarred galaxies ) ; however , @xcite found that they are more common in late type spirals ( see pohlen et al .",
    ", this volume ) .",
    "a striking contrast emerges when barred and unbarred galaxies are compared : unbarred galaxies are twice as likely to have type iii profiles ( 60% of unbarred galaxies , 32% of barred galaxies ) .",
    "this carries over into the barred galaxies themselves : weakly barred ( sab ) galaxies are more likely to have type iii profiles than strongly barred ( sb ) galaxies .",
    "similarly , the distribution of bar strengths ( deprojected maximum isophotal ellipticity ) is different for type iii and non - type iii profiles : bars in type iii galaxies have a median ( deprojected ) ellipticity of @xmath5 , versus @xmath6 for types i and ii .",
    "type ii profiles ( of all kinds ) are clearly more common in barred galaxies ( 49% of barred galaxies versus 27% of unbarred galaxies ) .",
    "however , they seem to be relatively unaffected by bar _ strength _ : for example , the type ii.o frequency is essentially identical for both sb and sab galaxies , and there is no difference in bar ellipticity between type i and ii.o profiles .",
    "what _ does _ appear to affect the presence of the type ii.o profiles is the _ environment_. specifically , barred galaxies in the virgo cluster have a much lower frequency of type ii.o profiles ( 10% ) than do barred galaxies in the field ( 49% ) . most of the `` missing '' ii.o profiles in the virgo cluster are type i profiles instead .",
    "although the numbers are relatively small , the result is significant at the 99.8% level .",
    "_ why _ this should be so is hard to say , particularly since we do nt yet know why some field galaxies have type i profiles and others have type ii .",
    "one speculative possibility is that type ii.o - olr profiles ( which are the vast majority of the field ii.o profiles ) require several gyr of interaction between the bar and gas in the outer disk .",
    "if the gas is removed rapidly enough , as might be the case for ram - pressure stripping of spirals which fell into the virgo cluster several gyr ago , then the olr break formation process might be choked off before it can proceed to completion .",
