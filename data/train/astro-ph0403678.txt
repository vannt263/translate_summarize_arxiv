    "the magnetorotational instability , or mri , has become central to our understanding of turbulent angular momentum transport in accretion disks ( e.g. balbus 2003 ) .",
    "the instability is important even when ( indeed , especially when ) the magnetic energy density is small compared with the thermal energy density .",
    "it is this feature , the fact that the stability of the gas is hypersensitive to the presence of subthermal magnetic fields of any geometry , that endows the mri with its special significance .",
    "in fact , the mri is merely one manifestation of much more general behavior . by imparting new degrees of freedom to a fluid , magnetic fields allow free energy gradients to become sources of instability , with important consequences for a variety of astrophysical systems : accretion disks become turbulent when the angular velocity ( not angular momentum ) decreases outward , and stratified dilute gases are destabilized when the temperature ( not entropy ) decreases upwards @xcite . the thermal destabilization caused by magnetic field is especially noteworthy because it is engendered by what seems at first a purely dissipative process : thermal diffusivity .",
    "it is the extreme anisotropy of the conductivity tensor parallel and perpendicular to the field lines that lies at the heart of the instability . by channeling heat only along lines of magnetic force , small - amplitude ripples along initially",
    "isothermal field lines grow into large fluid displacements parallel to the temperature gradient .",
    "this is not , as is sometimes thought , analogous to classical double - diffusive instabilities , such as ocean layer `` salt - fingering '' .",
    "rather , it depends wholly upon the properties of anisotropic conductivity .    in this paper",
    "we show that the anisotropy introduced into the viscous stress tensor by a weak magnetic field sharply destabilizes dilute astrophysical disks , even without lorentz forces appearing in the fluid equations . by `` dilute",
    ", '' we mean the limit in which the ion larmor radius is small compared to a mean free path , which in turn is small compared with the characteristic macroscopic length scales of the disk .",
    "we shall refer to the resulting viscous stress tensor in this limit as braginskii viscosity @xcite .",
    "the braginskii limit is appropriate for interstellar and galactic disks ( especially protogalactic disks , cf .",
    "malyshkin & kulsrud 2002 ) .",
    "a remarkable property of the instability is that in the absence of lorentz forces , when the viscous diffusivity much exceeds the resistive diffusivity , rapid growth times are associated with arbitrarily high wave numbers . except for isolated field geometries ( e.g. precisely azimuthal )",
    ", there is no formal high wavenumber dissipation of the linear magneto - viscous instability . by way of contrast , for the ultra - weak magnetic fields considered here , the wavelength of maximum growth in the classical mri would be strongly damped by an ordinary isotropic viscosity .",
    "( note that in real systems , at sufficiently high wave numbers , lorentz forces will ultimately stabilize . )",
    "the magnetic stability of a dilute plasma may also be studied using a plasma kinetic approach .",
    "this offers rigor in a problem where it is clearly of some benefit , but at a price of greater mathematical complexity .",
    "@xcite analyzed the mri in the collisionless regime , and noted that the character of the instability changes when the pressure tensor becomes significantly anisotropic , with growth rates in excess of the classical mri maximum .",
    "in the current work , we have in essence abstracted the anisotropic components of the pressure , and labeled them as a viscosity tensor .",
    "more recently , sharma , hammett & quataert ( 2003 ) reanalyzed the kinetic problem using a krook collision operator , and showed that the collisional and collisionless behavior are on the same branch of the dispersion relation . in the short mean free path limit , the pressure tensor associated with the equations used by sharma et al .",
    "2003 reduces to a scalar pressure plus the dominant parallel components of the braginskii viscosity ( snyder , hammett , & dorland 1997 ) . the current work , a purely gasdynamical treatment of the problem , affords relative mathematical simplicity and a physically transparent interpretation .",
    "in either its kinetic or gasdynamical guise , this vigorous instability may be important in the early stages of magnetic field amplification in disk galaxies , when densities are low , temperatures are relatively high , and the field is likely to be very weak .",
    "quataert et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and sharma et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discuss applications to black hole accretion flows of low radiative efficiency .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 is a discussion of the regime of the applicability of this work and a presentation of the magnetic viscosity formalism .",
    "section 3 is the heart of the paper , formulating and solving the problem , and checking the validity of the results .",
    "section 4 is a discussion of the applicability of our results to galactic magnetism , and section 5 summarizes our findings .",
    "we begin with a physical description of the instability .",
    "the process is very simple . in the leftmost diagram of figure 1 ( a )",
    ", we show three representative azimuthal field lines , with increasing azimuth toward the top .",
    "the angular velocity gradient @xmath0 is radial , pointing from right to left , so that smaller angular velocities lie to the right .",
    "the angular momentum gradient , by contrast , runs from left to right .",
    "initially , there is no viscous transport of angular momentum , because the angular velocity gradient and field lines are orthogonal .",
    "the middle portion of figure 1 ( b ) shows the field lines and two fiducial fluid elements ( dark circular disks ) after a perturbation has created a small oscillatory radial component .",
    "now there is a component of @xmath0 along the field lines , and viscous angular momentum transport , represented by the thin arrows , is able to commence .",
    "the rightward fluid element acquires angular momentum , while the leftward element loses angular momentum .    in the rightmost portion of the figure ( c ) ,",
    "the loss of angular momentum causes the element on the left to fall further leftward , towards orbits of smaller angular momentum .",
    "the element on the right , on the other hand , acquires angular momentum , and moves toward the higher angular momentum orbits that lie further to the right .",
    "the critical point is that these dynamical motions stretch the field lines yet more radially , allowing yet more angular momentum to flow between the elements , and the process runs away .",
    "the instability blends different aspects of previously known instabilities .",
    "it works on the same dynamical principles as the mri , tethering fluid elements and transporting angular momentum between them , but there is no magnetic tension here .",
    "similarly , it works using the same gradient transport process seen in the magneto - thermal instability , channeling diffusive transport along magnetic field lines while simultaneously realigning them , but with angular momentum rather than heat .",
    "the result of all this , we shall see , is an extremely powerful shear instability .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field alters the form of the viscosity when ( _ ci _ ci)^-1 1 , where @xmath1 is the ion cyclotron frequency and @xmath2 is the ion - ion mean collision time .",
    "( this is tantamount to having the mean free path much exceed the gyroradius . ) under laboratory conditions , this is normally considered to be the large field strength limit , but it is very much the norm for interstellar plasmas , even when the field is very weak .",
    "indeed , reference to @xcite gives for a hydrogenic plasma _ ci _ ci = ( 1.0910 ^ 5n ) t_4 ^ 3/2b_g , where @xmath3 is the proton density in @xmath4 , @xmath5 the kinetic temperature in units of @xmath6 k , @xmath7 is the magnetic field in microgauss , and @xmath8 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath9 . with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "very weak fields are clearly accommodated by the asymptotic regime @xmath12 .",
    "the ion mean free path @xmath13 and gyroradius @xmath14 are respectively _ mfp = 5.210 ^ 11 ( 20 ) ( t_4 ^ 2n )  , r_g = 1.3 ( t_4 ^ 1/2b_g )       throughout this work , we ignore the effects of finite resistivity .",
    "the ratio of the viscosity to resistivity is known as the magnetic prandtl number @xmath15 , and may be adapted from balbus & hawley ( 1998 ) : = ( t10 ^ 4)^4(6.510 ^ 10n ) ( 20)^2 .",
    "we may easily restrict the calculations to @xmath16 k and @xmath17 @xmath4 , so that @xmath18 , and resistivity will be ignored . since these questions can be subtle however , we return to this point _",

    "equations ( [ sigvec ] ) and ( [ sigij ] ) allow one to determine the magnetic viscous stress in a frame suitable for working with fluid variables , given the local field geometry .",
    "we consider the stability of a disk in the presence of a magnetic field , but with a field so weak that all dynamical magnetic forces are negligibly small .",
    "in contrast to the mri , we assume this `` magneto - anemic '' condition is true not only for the equilibrium disk , but even for small wavelength , wkb perturbations .",
    "the sole effect of the magnetic field is to restrict viscous transport in accordance with prescription of  2 .",
    "the fundamental fluid equations used here are mass conservation + ( ) = 0 , the equation of motion , (  t + ) = - p - -_ijx_j , and the induction equation of ideal mhd , = ( ) . for reasons that will become clear , an internal energy equation is not needed at this stage .",

    "indeed , the point of this calculation is to show that any development of viscous transport along a field line is highly unstable .",

    "the instability presented in this paper is generic and powerful .",

    "long radial and azimuthal wavelengths are highly unstable , imparting large scale coherence in the disk plane already in the linear stages of instability . in this section",
    "we discuss the possibility that this mechanism could be an important part of the process that gives rise to galactic magnetic fields .",
    "generally , galactic magnetic amplification processes are divided into two principal categories @xcite : ( 1 ) differential wind - up of a primordial field ( kulsrud 1986 ) ; and ( 2 ) dynamo amplification of a similar seed field .",
    "the latter category itself consists of at least two very distinct mechanisms ; ( 2a ) a classical @xmath99 dynamo ( parker 1979 ) , and ( 2b ) small scale turbulent amplification ( schekochihin et al .",
    "the weak field limit of these mechanisms are thought to be kinematic in nature .",
    "it is difficult to see how the process outlined in this paper could be unimportant , at least quantitatively , to any of these processes .",
    "simple wind - up of a seed field by differential rotation fails to incorporate properly the true dynamics of either the mri or the magneto - viscous instability described here .",
    "differential rotation and essentially any field geometry is highly unstable , resulting in large radial motions and ultimately mhd turbulence .",
    "the shearing of radial fields of course readily occurs , but it is not the primary amplification process of a differentially rotating system .",
    "traditional @xmath99 galactic dynamo models rely on the presence of favorable properties of interstellar turbulence to generate the required mean helicity .",
    "curiously , these theories of magnetic field amplification generally do not incorporate weak - field mhd instabilities , despite the latter s obvious potential benefits ( e.g. brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 ; hawley , gammie , & balbus 1996 ) .",
    "conversely , without something like the mri or the magneto - viscous instability , it is not so obvious that turbulence will generally amplify the field , at least at low to moderate values of @xmath15 .",
    "an example of dissipative behavior is seen in a simulation of hawley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . the combination of hydrodynamical shear - layer turbulence plus a magnetic field lead not to dynamo activity , but to field energy loss .",
    "this result emerged despite the fact that calculation was done not in the kinematic limit , but fully in the mhd regime .",
    "however , the combination of local coriolis , tidal , and lorentz forces dramatically altered the dynamo properties of the ensuing turbulence : rapid and significant field amplification was observed , driven by the mri turbulence , in a hydrodynamically stable background .",
    "more recently , the notion that non - helical homogeneous small scale turbulence may play a key role in galactic dynamos , particularly in the early stages , has been investigated in a series of numerical simulations ( schekochihin et al .",
    "2004 ; see also zeldovich et al .",
    "1984 , kulsrud & anderson 1992 ) , which include a scalar viscosity and study the non - kinematical regime .",
    "the idea is that certain magnetic field configurations ( termed `` winning '' by schekochihin et al . )",
    "align themselves smoothly with the stretching direction of the strain tensor of the turbulent flow , but fluctuate along the corresponding null axis , so that the work done on the field by fluid element stretching is not undone by relaxation . a sort of turbulent ratchet thereby ensues , growing the field with enormous efficiency at small scales .",
    "numerical simulations of homogeneous white noise forcing conducted by schekochihin et al .",
    "2004 resulted in exponential field amplification , but , interestingly , only in the regime of large @xmath15 .",
    "what the relationship is between these small scale structures and a galactic scale field has yet to be established .",
    "further discussion of the pros and cons of this mechanism would take us too far afield , but we may note that the generation of coherent magnetic field structure on scales larger than the disk scale height requires time scales at least as long as @xmath100 . and while it may well be that intrinsic interstellar turbulence plays a role in the amplification of galactic magnetic fields , we emphasize here a phenomenon that is certainly unavoidable : differential rotation .",
    "in fact , there is no reason to restrict oneself to galactic radius scales : if sub - galactic , differentially rotating turbulent vorticies are also present , magneto - viscous modes should be seen on these scales as well .",
    "the key point is that a kinematic approach will miss this process , which is intrinsically mhd .",
    "one compelling origin of the seed field for the galactic amplification process is the stars themselves ( biermann 1950 , rees 1993 ) , in which both battery processes and a truly powerful , rapid dynamo are likely to be present .",
    "a 0.1 g azimuthal surface field diluted in a stellar wind to interstellar scales would give rise to a seed field of @xmath101 g . with @xmath102",
    "k , @xmath103 @xmath104 , one finds @xmath105 and the regime of the magneto - viscous instability is valid .",
    "the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure is @xmath106 , an extremely weak field by this measure .",
    "the linear amplification factor per orbit of the magnetic energy , as noted in  3.2 , is huge : @xmath69 .",
    "the makings of an mhd dynamo would seem to be present .",
    "if a combination of magneto - viscous and magneto - rotational processes is to be a viable candidate for galactic field production , it needs to be shown that ( 1 ) the bulk of the field energy emerges in the largest scales ; and ( 2 ) the saturated field energy density can grow to levels comparable to the thermal pressure .",
    "definitive answers will require a numerical treatment , but in the meantime the following points may be considered .",
    "a magnetic energy spectrum dominated by the largest scales appears to be a universal outcome of mri simulations ( e.g. hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ) , despite the fact that the most unstable modes occur at scales much smaller than the scale height . in such calculations ,",
    "the available dynamical range is limited . to the extent",
    "it can be measured , however , the inertial range is kolmogorov - like in the magnetic energy . in hydrodynamics , kolmogorov scaling for",
    "the kinetic energy power spectrum is universal , if the dissipation rate per unit volume is the sole constant characterizing the cascade , as often seems to be the case .",
    "universal processes may also be at work in mhd turbulence ( kraichnan 1963 ; goldreich & sridhar 1997 ) .",
    "an important caveat , however , is that most mhd turbulence studies have been based on wave - wave interactions ( which may be of secondary importance in linearly unstable rotating systems ) , and they have yet to address the role of a magnetized viscosity .",
    "indeed , a magnetized viscosity may be crucial to understanding why interstellar fields are thermal strength ( or even slightly above ) , whereas all numerical mri simulations to date have yielded subthermal saturated field strengths .",
    "it has been argued ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) that the outcome may be well be sensitive to @xmath15 .",
    "the point is that large scale reconnection proceeds relatively easily in simulations when the resistive scale is comparable to or larger than the viscous scale .",
    "in `` ideal mhd , '' both scales are grid based .",
    "but matters are likely to be very different if the viscous scale is , say , five orders of magnitude larger . in that case",
    ", enormous viscous stresses would occur in the course of setting up a reconnection front , and prevent its formation . with reconnection stifled , mhd turbulence could amplify the field to its natural dynamical limit : the thermal energy density . beyond this point ,",
    "buoyant effects would make it difficult for a suprathermal field to remain in the disk and be further amplified ( parker 1979 ) .",
    "large prandtl number simulations have in fact recently begun ( schekochihin et al . 2004 ) , and treatments of the anisotropic braginskii viscosity and conductivity have yet to be attempted . with the resistivity scale hidden below the viscous dissipation scale ,",
    "there is no effective small scale sink for the magnetic field , and is therefore not surprising to note that schekochihin et al .",
    "find that the magnetic energy spectra increases with wave number on subviscous scales , before it is ultimately cut - off . by way of sharp contrast , the ideal mri simulations noted above find a monotonically decreasing energy spectrum for the magnetic field ( hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ) .",
    "the magneto - viscous instability is a powerful and general mechanism to amplify weak magnetic fields in galaxies , or in hot dilute plasmas more generally , and is worthy of more detailed study .",
    "of particular interest would be a suite of numerical simulations designed to isolate the differences between high prandtl number turbulent dynamos relying on mhd and differential rotation , those based on random forcing only , and those containing both .",
    "when the ion larmor radius is less than its collisional mean free path , the form of the viscosity is altered .",
    "crudely speaking , angular momentum is transported only along magnetic lines of force .",
    "this causes conjoined fluid elements in a differentially rotating system to separate radially , dragging field lines with them .",
    "this aligns the field lines along the angular velocity gradient , causing an increase in the diffusive angular momentum transport , and the process is highly unstable .",
    "the instability has previously been studied in its plasma kinetic guise ( quataert et al .",
    "2002 ; sharma et al .",
    "2003 ) , and we find quantitative agreement in areas of overlap with this approach .",
    "the magneto - viscous instability does not rely directly upon magnetic stresses ; the field serves merely to channel angular momentum transport along its lines of force .",
    "this is effective even at exceedingly weak magnetic field strengths .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the instability is given by equation ( [ gammax ] ) , and exceeds the oort - a value of any disk stable by the hydrodynamical rayleigh criterion .",
    "numerical simulation of the nonlinear resolution of the instability promises to be a challenging problem .",
    "preliminary studies on the related magneto - thermal instability , have , in fact , begun ( j. stone 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "the long mean free path regime is appropriate to nonradiative accretion flows around black holes ( quataert et al .",
    "2002 ; sharma et al . 2003 ) , or to the interstellar medium of disk galaxies , our interest in this work .",
    "the magneto - viscous instability is thus a candidate for amplifying very small galactic seed fields into thermal strength fields . the turbulent mhd power spectrum , if it may be extrapolated from the moderately resolved , relatively low prandtl number regime of previous examples , would evidence most of the power on large scales . on the other hand , the large prandtl number regime , which characterizes the interstellar medium , ensures that the resistive dissipation scale is much smaller than the viscous scale",
    "this may make it possible to grow thermal strength magnetic fields , despite the subthermal fields obtained in numerical mri simulations , which correspond to the opposite prandtl regime .",
    "but , at the same time , it is possible that the high prandtl number regime may skew the power spectrum toward smaller scales ( schekochihin et al . 2004 ) .",
    "a very general gasdynamical investigation of the instability , including its behavior for arbitrary wavenumber directions , and the dynamical stress of field line tension , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( islam & balbus 2004 , in preparation ) .",
