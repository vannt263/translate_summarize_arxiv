    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite in trapped dilute atomic gases has stimulated a large interest in the physics of ultracold gases , both bosonic and fermionic ones .",
    "related with the latter , similar cooling methods as those employed to reach bec have been recently employed to accomplish a degenerate fermi gas , i.e. a fermi gas with temperature @xmath3 below the fermi temperature ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . for @xmath4",
    "the fermi pressure becomes noticeable , and as a consequence the fermi cloud becomes significantly broader than a bec under the same temperature .",
    "additionally , for temperatures below a critical one , @xmath5 , the system should undergo a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) transition @xcite .",
    "when this occurs the system becomes superfluid , due to the cooper pairing of particles near the fermi surface .",
    "the accomplishment of bcs pairing and its observation have been considered in detail @xcite .",
    "however , the employed cooling schemes have not yet allowed for temperatures below @xmath5 , which has been predicted to be much smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "those cooling methods rely on collisional processes , which in the degenerate regime are strongly suppressed due to pauli blocking . as a consequence ,",
    "the cooling efficiency decreases , and technical losses have prevented until now from reaching temperatures well below @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it has been proposed that the latter obstacle could be overcome by employing feshbach resonances @xcite or optical lattices @xcite in order to increase the ratio @xmath6 up to @xmath7 , opening the possibility to achieve bcs in a temperature range where the collisional processes are still efficient enough .",
    "in fact , very recently temperatures @xmath8 have been reported by ohara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which are below the predicted value of @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    "we show that laser cooling could provide an effective and realistic tool to cool one- and two - component fermi gases well below @xmath1 .",
    "the proposed method is realized in the _ festina lente _ ( fl ) regime @xcite , in which the spontaneous emission rate @xmath10 is smaller than the trap frequency @xmath11 . in this regime",
    "the heating introduced by photon reabsorptions can be suppressed . in the absence of technical losses the major limitation to the laser cooling in",
    "the _ festina lente _",
    "regime is set up by the finite value of lamb - dicke parameter , defined as the square root of the ratio of the recoil energy to @xmath12 . in practice , when the spontaneous emission rate becomes much smaller than the trap frequency , the finite available time sets limit on achievable temperatures , due to always present loss mechanism .",
    "reaching fl regime is experimentally feasible , and has been in fact demonstrated in experiments by the group of weiss @xcite , in which a suppression of reabsorptions for decreasing @xmath13 has been observed for tightly bound atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "the laser cooling in the fl regime down to the quantum degeneracy has been already predicted to work for bosons @xcite and for polarized fermions @xcite .",
    "the latter case is particularly interesting , since evaporative cooling can not be employed to a single - component fermionic system , due to the absence of @xmath14-wave scattering , while less restrictive , sympathetic cooling techniques @xcite , are also eventually limited due to pauli blocking . the bcs transition in such a system could be realized by externally inducing interatomic interactions , for instance dipole - dipole ones @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the three - dimensional laser cooling of fermi gases down to temperatures @xmath15 , by performing monte carlo simulations of the quantum dynamics governed by the master equation ( me ) . for @xmath3",
    "comparable to @xmath1 , the laser cooling of fermions is affected by the statistical inhibition of the spontaneous emission , which results in a decrease of the cooling efficiency . in a previous work",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the laser cooling of a polarized fermi gas .",
    "we have theoretically predicted that the above mentioned problem can be overcome by either dynamically adjusting the spontaneous emission rate in a raman cooling process , or by employing appropriately designed anharmonic traps .",
    "we first consider the single - component case .",
    "in particular , we analyze the statistics of the laser - cooled gases , comparing the results with those expected for a thermal distribution .",
    "we show that whereas the mean - number distribution can be well approximated by a corresponding thermal one , the fluctuations significantly differ from the thermal case .",
    "this could have significant effects in the bcs pairing of these gases after an interatomic interaction is induced in the way discussed above .    in the second part of this work",
    ", we analyze the laser - cooling of a two - component fermi gas . for this case",
    ", the collisions between different components can not be neglected .",
    "we consider them within the formalism of quantum boltzmann master equation ( qbme ) . this formalism is shown to produced the expected thermal distribution in the absence of laser cooling .",
    "we analyze the case in which only one of the fermionic species is laser - cooled , whereas the other one is sympathetically cooled as a result of the collisions between different components .",
    "we show that the laser - cooling is significantly favored by the presence of the second component .",
    "we analyzed also the statistics of the atom distribution , showing that the fluctuations at the fermi surface are significantly enhanced compared to the thermal case .",
    "finally , we analyze the heating induced by background collisions , and show that the laser cooling can be employed to maintain a two - component fermi gas at a fixed temperature for a relatively long time without significant atom losses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss our cooling scheme , and obtain the me that describes the raman cooling in the fl regime . we also describe in this section the corresponding me for the two - component case .",
    "we present the resulting rate equations and discuss their physical properties . in section",
    "iii we present our numerical results concerning the laser cooling of a single component gas , characterizing the statistical properties of the laser - cooled gas . in section",
    "iv we present our results for the case of a two  component fermi gas , in which one of the components is laser - cooled .",
    "we discuss the statistics for this case , as well as the heating induced by losses , and its control using laser - cooling .",
    "we finalize in section v with some conclusions .",
    "we consider @xmath16 fermionic atoms with an accessible electronic three  level @xmath17 scheme , with levels @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the ground state @xmath18 is coupled via a raman transition to @xmath19 ( which is assumed metastable ) .",
    "another laser couples @xmath19 to the upper state @xmath20 , which rapidly decays into @xmath18 . after the adiabatic elimination of @xmath20 , a two  level system is obtained , with an effective rabi frequency @xmath21 , and an effective spontaneous emission rate @xmath10 .",
    "the latter can be controlled by modifying the coupling from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the atoms are confined in a non - isotropic dipole trap with frequencies @xmath22 , @xmath23 , different for the ground and the excited states , and non - commensurable one with another .",
    "the latter assumption simplifies enormously the dynamics of the spontaneous emission processes in the fl limit .",
    "when deriving the quantum me , it is important to cancel the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix , in order to reduce the me to a rate equation , which is possible to simulate numerically with monte carlo methods .",
    "the anisotropy of the trap does not need to be very large , and for practical purposes can be rather small .",
    "its effects in the rate equations is not relevant at all , and consequently in our simulation we consider the simple case of isotropic trap .",
    "the cooling process consists of sequences of raman pulses of appropriate frequencies , adjusted is such a way that they induce the transition of atoms to the lower motional states of the trap .",
    "we assume weak optical excitation , so that no significant population in @xmath19 is present .",
    "this allows to adiabatically eliminate @xmath19 , and consequently to consider only the density matrix @xmath24 describing all atoms in @xmath18 , and being diagonal in the fock representation corresponding to the bare trap levels .",
    "let us introduce the annihilation and creation operators of atoms in the ground ( excited ) state and in the trap level @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , which we denote by @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "these operators fulfill standard fermionic anticommutation relations : @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we use the standard theory of quantum - stochastic processes @xcite to develop the quantum me that governs the dynamics of cooling @xcite . the derivation of the me for fermions proceeds basically in a similar way to the corresponding derivation for bosons .",
    "the latter was presented in details in @xcite .",
    "the me that describes the dynamics of the density matrix @xmath33 of the atoms in the fl regime is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the single  atom effective spontaneous emission rate , @xmath21 is the rabi frequency associated with the atom transition and the laser field , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the energies of the ground ( excited ) harmonic trap level @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath40 is the laser detuning from the atomic transition , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fluorescence dipole pattern , and @xmath43 are the frank  condon factors . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which allows for adiabatic elimination of excited state @xmath19 . to assure the fl regime we require also",
    "@xmath46 at least in the initial phase of the cooling process .",
    "the dynamics of the two - component system in the fl limit , where only the first component is laser cooled , may be described by the following me : @xmath47 the new term @xmath48 that appears in equation ( [ me1 ] ) describes the process of elastic collisions between the two species : @xmath49 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of atoms of the second component in the trap state @xmath25 . since at low temperatures collisions between atoms are purely of @xmath14-wave type , the operator @xmath53 accounts only for collisions between atoms in the second component and those atoms in the ground electronic state @xmath18 of the first species .",
    "the collisions with the atoms in the @xmath19 can be neglected if the laser is sufficiently weak to assure that only a small fraction of atoms is excited in each pulse .",
    "the amplitude @xmath54 in equation ( [ hcoll ] ) reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) denotes the wavefunction of the @xmath58-th level of the @xmath18 , ( @xmath59 ) trap , and @xmath60 is the scattering length .",
    "the term @xmath61 from the me ( [ me1 ] ) , includes the effective hamiltonian @xmath62 , which in the presence of two components , accounts also for the energies of atoms of the second component @xmath63 for the assumed regime of parameters , the excited state may be adiabatically eliminated . to this end",
    "we use standard projection operator techniques @xcite .",
    "the corresponding calculus proceed in the same way as in the case of bosons , which was described in detail in @xcite . here , we present only the final results . for sufficiently weak interactions between the two species , the dynamics due to the collisions and the dynamics due to the laser  cooling are independent @xcite .",
    "the process of laser cooling may be described by the me ( [ me ] ) without the collisional part , while the collisional part of dynamics after the adiabatic elimination takes the form of qbme , similar to the one formulated for bosons and presented in @xcite .",
    "the rate equations for the populations @xmath64 and @xmath65 in level @xmath58 and @xmath25 of the trap @xmath18 and @xmath59 respectively , are given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the rate of laser - induced transition from state @xmath25 to state @xmath58 of the @xmath18 trap @xmath68 ^ 2+\\gamma^2 ( r_{l}+\\xi_{lp})^2 } , \\label{pmn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath69 .",
    "the rate @xmath70 of a collision between two fermions of different species , occupying the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the trap respectively , resulting in a transition to the states @xmath58 and @xmath25 , is given by @xmath73 in the transition rate ( [ pmn ] ) one can clearly identify two contributions due to the quantum  statistical character of fermions : ( a ) if the system becomes more degenerate , @xmath74 vanishes , and the atoms remain for very long times in the excited state @xmath26 , i.e. the spontaneous emission is inhibited .",
    "this affects negatively the cooling process in two ways : first , it prolongs the cooling , and second , the excited - ground collisions can occur and lead to heating and losses .",
    "in addition , the adiabatic elimination used in the derivation of equation .",
    "( [ pmn ] ) ceases to be valid .",
    "( b ) the fermionic inhibition factor @xmath75 appears in the numerator of the probabilities , introducing also a slowing - down of the cooling process .",
    "the negative influence of fermi statistics above can be overcome by dynamically changing of @xmath10 in raman cooling @xcite .",
    "one can increase it gradually during the cooling in order to avoid the inhibition effects , but still remaining in the fl regime . note that , the fl condition involves the spontaneous emission rate modified in the presence of other atoms : @xmath76 .",
    "still , even if one uses such approach some small fraction of the atoms will remain in the excited state after the cooling pulse , and has to be removed from the trap in order to avoid non - elastic collisions .",
    "the latter aim can be achieved by optically pumping the excited atoms to a third non - trapped level .",
    "this introduces a new loss mechanism which we take into account in the simulations .",
    "the calculations of the laser cooling were performed for the case of a three - dimensional harmonic trap . for simplicity",
    "we assumed that the trap is isotropic with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the main difficulty for performing monte ",
    "carlo simulations of the laser  cooling for fermions is the large number of states in the calculation . since one state can be populated maximally by one fermion , in order to perform a simulation for a medium - size atomic sample ( in our case @xmath77 atoms ) , we had to consider rather large trap ( @xmath78 energy levels in our case ) .",
    "in addition if the simulation starts from a temperature above @xmath1 , the number of states must be much larger than the number of atoms in the trap .",
    "for an initial number of @xmath77 atoms , we calculated the cooling dynamics for the trap consisting of approximately @xmath79 states . for a single component gas of fermions , where the collisions between the atoms are absent , we were able to perform simulations treating each state of the trap separately . in this case the transition is only induced by the laser , and its rate given by ( [ pmn ] ) depends only on two states .",
    "the number of different probabilities that one have to recalculate after the change of the atomic distribution is roughly @xmath80 .    in the case of the two  component fermi gas",
    ", one has to account for the process of collisions , in which the transition rate ( [ pcoll ] ) depends on four numbers : two initial states and two final states .",
    "the number of different probabilities that one has to recalculate after a single transition takes place is roughly @xmath81 .",
    "the number of operations required to calculate the probabilities is orders of magnitude too large for numerical computations .",
    "therefore for simulating the cooling in two - species gas , we have applied the ergodic approximation .",
    "we assume that the populations of the states with the same energy are equal : @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the number of atoms of the @xmath58-th component occupying the energy shell @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the degeneracy of the energy shell @xmath85 .",
    "this approximation relies on the fact that for typical parameters , the collisional processes are much faster than the laser cooling . additionally the thermalization inside a single energy shell is much faster than the thermalization between energy shells of different energies .",
    "the assumption that collisions occur much more frequently than laser induced transitions , is necessary , since the laser cooling is not fully `` compatible '' with the ergodic approximation .",
    "the cooling is based on the process of absorption of a photon from one of three orthogonal laser beams , therefore the rate of transition depends on the three dimensional structure of the initial and the final state . due to this dependence",
    ", we have not been able to find a simpler formula , which would be a counterpart of equation ( [ pmn ] ) in ergodic approximation . in the case of the collisional process ,",
    "however , one can further develop the rate ( [ pcoll ] ) in order to fully utilize the advantages of the ergodic approximation .",
    "the rate of collision , between fermions occupying the energy shells @xmath87 and @xmath88 , resulting in a transition to the energy shells @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the ergodic approximation is given by @xmath91 where the amplitude of the transition @xmath92 is defined as follows @xmath93 in principle , the amplitude of transition @xmath92 may be calculated directly from equation .",
    "( [ uerg ] ) , by performing a summation of the terms @xmath94 given by formula ( [ udef ] ) .",
    "this requires , however , a lot of numerical efforts , since the number of operations is of the order @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the number of states in the trap .",
    "this can be avoided , if the trap is isotropic , in which case we were able to derive a simplified expression @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",

    "we have used standard summation formulas for hermite polynomials @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ uerg1 ] ) can be further simplified , if the collisions involves distant energy shells , i.e. the minimum @xmath109 of the set of numbers @xmath110 is much smaller than its maximum @xmath111 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the following approximate formula holds @xmath112 with the help of the exact expression ( [ uerg1 ] ) , we have verified numerically that the approximation ( [ uappr ] ) gives correct results , already for @xmath113 . equation ( [ uappr ] ) leads to small errors for low lying energy shells , and for the transitions between neighboring shells . in the simulations , however ,",
    "we have used the values calculated numerically with the help of the exact formula ( [ uerg1 ] ) .",
    "the numerical simulations of the cooling were performed using monte carlo techniques . in the calculation we assumed that the atoms are confined in a dipole trap , characterized by a lamb - dicke parameter @xmath114 , with @xmath115 being the size of the ground state of the trap , and @xmath116 the laser wavelength . in the context of laser cooling ,",
    "an optical dipole trap was recently employed in experiments on all - optical production of a degenerate gas of two species of li @xcite , and it is also considered in current experiments in mg @xcite . due to numerical limitations we assumed lamb - dicke parameter @xmath117 @xcite . the assumed value of @xmath118 is not unrealistic , and can be realized for instance by trapping potassium atoms in a dipole trap with @xmath119  khz , which is the trapping frequency employed in experiments in @xmath120 @xcite , and a laser wavelength @xmath121  nm . in the calculation we use the above mentioned values to calculate real cooling time .",

    "the three - dimensional isotropic harmonic trap contains @xmath124 energy levels , which corresponds to @xmath125 states .    in the gas of fermions the main sources of losses are background collisions and photoassociation .",
    "background collisions result from non ideal vacuum conditions in the experiment , and introduce a relevant heating mechanism for temperatures well below fermi temperature @xcite . in the simulations we assumed a background collision rate @xmath126 hz @xcite .",
    "photoassociation losses ( when the laser is tuned between molecular resonances ) are typically of the order of @xmath127@xmath128/s for laser intensities of @xmath107mw/@xmath129 @xcite . in our case",
    "the laser intensities needed are typically @xmath130 times smaller and we estimate that for @xmath122 atoms , the atomic density is smaller than @xmath131@xmath132",
    ". therefore the photoassociation losses can be safely neglected .",
    "the other type of losses which we account for in our calculations is the removal process of long - living excited atoms at the end of each cooling pulse .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the time - dependence of the temperature of a laser - cooled one - component gas of fermions .",
    "the inset shows the time dependence of the number of fermions , that decreases due to losses . as the initial state of the system we consider a thermal distribution with temperature @xmath133 .",
