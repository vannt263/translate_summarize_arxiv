    "the most massive galaxies may place interesting constraints on models of galaxy formation ( e.g. de lucia et al . 2006 ; almeida et al . 2007 ) . but",
    "which observable one should use as a proxy for mass is debatable .",
    "if luminosity is a good proxy , then the brightest cluster galaxies should be the most massive galaxies ; this has led to considerable interest in their properties ( scott 1957 ; sandage 1976 ; thuan & romanishin 1981 ; malumuth & kirschner 1981 ; hoessel et al .",

    "2007a ) .",
    "however , velocity dispersion is sometimes used as a surrogate for mass ( the virial theorem has mass @xmath8 ) , so it is interesting to ask if a sample selected on the basis of velocity dispersion also contains the most massive galaxies .",
    "such a sample is also interesting in view of the fact that black hole mass correlates strongly and tightly with velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , so galaxies with large @xmath3 are expected to host the most massive black holes .    with this in mind , bernardi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) culled a sample of @xmath9 objects with @xmath10  km  s@xmath1 from the first data release of the sload digital sky survey ( sdss dr1 ; abazajian et al .",
    "the total area from which these objects were selected is about 2000  deg@xmath11 ; for a spatially flat universe with @xmath12 and hubble constant @xmath13  km  s@xmath1 , which we assume in what follows , this corresponds to a comoving volume of about @xmath14  mpc@xmath15 out to @xmath16 .",
    "some of these objects turned out to be objects in superposition , evidence for which came primarily from the spectra ( see bernardi et al .",
    "2006 for details ) . a random subset of the others , 43 objects in all , was observed with the high resolution camera of the advanced camera system on board the hubble space telescope ( hst - acs hrc ) . on the basis of this high - resolution imaging",
    ", we have been able to separate out the true singles from those which are objects in superposition . as a result , we are now able to study the properties of objects with large @xmath3 .",
    "we describe the hst observations , our identification of the truly single objects , our classification of their isophotal shapes , and how we combine the hst imaging with sdss data to determine the environments of these objects in section  [ hst ] .",
    "the isophotal shapes of these objects are compared with those of bcgs in section  [ shapes ] .",
    "various scaling relations , size - luminosity , the fundamental plane , etc . are presented in section  [ scaling ] .",
    "while these relations are different from those defined by the bulk of the early - type galaxy population , we show that they can actually be derived from the early - type scaling relations simply by studying what these relations look like at fixed velocity dispersion .",
    "these analyses show that our sample appears to contain two distinct types of objects : the more luminous objects tend to be round , have large sizes as well as velocity dispersions , and tend to be in crowded fields .",
    "indeed , they are rounder than other objects of similar luminosities , so it is possible that they are prolate , and viewed along the long axis .",
    "the less luminous objects are not round , have abnormally small sizes and are not necessarily in crowded fields ; even if rotational motions have compromised the sdss velocity dispersion estimates , these objects may be amongst the densest galaxies for their luminosities .",
    "a final section summarizes our findings and discusses some implications of the bimodal distribution we have found , as well as of the fact that no galaxy appears to have a velocity dispersion larger than @xmath17  km  s@xmath1 .    in a companion paper ( hyde et al .",
    "2008 ) , we study the surface brightness profiles of the objects classified as singles in much more detail , placing them in the context of other hst - based studies of early - type galaxies ( e.g. laine et al . 2003 ; ferrarese et al . 2006 ; lauer et al .",
    "the analysis below is based on observations taken between august 2004 and june 2005 as part of a cycle 13 snapshot survey .",
    "the target list for the snapshot survey contained 70 objects , all of which were selected from the sdss as described in paper i ; i.e. , they all had reported velocity dispersions larger than 350  km  s@xmath1 , and none were identified from the imaging , the line profiles or the cross - correlation analyses described in paper i as being multiple . of these 70 objects , 43 were observed .",
    "the following observing sequence was adopted for each target galaxy : + -the center of each galaxy was positioned close to the hrc aperture .",
    "+ -a total integration time of 1200  s in the f775w ( which resembles sdss @xmath2 ) filter , split into four exposures of 300  s , was used .",
    "+ -each visit used the line - dither pattern to allow removal of most cosmic ray events .",
    "+ data reduction details and analysis of the photometric profiles are presented in hyde et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .      in the present context ,",
    "the great virtue of hst is its angular resolution ( @xmath18  arcsec / pixel ) : at the median redshift of our sample , @xmath19 , scales down to about 95  pc are resolved .",
    "( this scale , for sdss imaging , is about sixty times larger . ) therefore , a simple visual inspection of the f775w images allowed a classification into three groups : + ( i ) 23 targets showed no evidence for superposition - we call these single galaxies ; + ( ii ) 15 targets appear to be superpositions of two galaxies - we call these doubles ; + ( iii ) 5 targets show evidence for more than two components - we call these multiples .    figures  [ a1][a6 ] show density contours ( isophotes ) obtained from the acs f775w images of these objects .",
    "two panels are shown for each object .",
    "the panels on the left show fields - of - view that are approximately @xmath20  arcsec@xmath11 ( north is up , east is to the left ) , and the contours are linearly spaced in magnitude ( logarithmically spaced in flux ) .",
    "the solid circle shows the angular size of the sdss fiber ( 3 arcsec in diameter ) .",
    "this is the scale within which the velocity dispersion was measured ( this measured value is aperture corrected to @xmath21 - see bernardi et al .",
    "2006 for details ) .",
    "light from objects outside the circle is very unlikely to affect the velocity dispersion and absorption line - index measurements .",
    "the panels on the right show the central arcsecond , and the contours are linearly spaced in flux . in these panels , we specify if the object was classified as a single .",

    "<S> we study a sample of 43 early - type galaxies , selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) because they appeared to have velocity dispersions of @xmath0350  kms@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution photometry in the sdss @xmath2 passband using the high - resolution channel of the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble space telescope shows that just less than half of the sample is made up of superpositions of two or three galaxies , so the reported velocity dispersion is incorrect . </S>",
    "<S> the other half of the sample is made up of single objects with genuinely large velocity dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> none of these objects has @xmath3 larger than @xmath4  km  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these objects define rather different size- , mass- and density - luminosity relations than the bulk of the early - type galaxy population : for their luminosities , they are the smallest , most massive and densest galaxies in the universe . although the slopes of the scaling relations they define are rather different from those of the bulk of the population , they lie approximately parallel to those of the bulk _ at fixed @xmath3_. this suggests that these objects are simply the large-@xmath3 extremes of the early - type population  they are not otherwise unusual . </S>",
    "<S> these objects appear to be of two distinct types : the less luminous ( @xmath5 ) objects are rather flattened , and their properties suggest some amount of rotational support . while this may complicate interpretation of the sdss velocity dispersion estimate , and hence estimates of their dynamical mass and density , we argue that these objects are extremely dense for their luminosities , suggesting merger histories with abnormally large amounts of gaseous dissipation . the more luminous objects ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> tend to be round and to lie in or at the centers of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> their circular isophotes , large velocity dispersions , and environments are consistent with the hypothesis that they are bcgs </S>",
    "<S> . models in which bcgs form from predominantly radial mergers having little angular momentum predict that they should be prolate . </S>",
    "<S> if viewed along the major axis , such objects would appear to have abnormally large velocity dispersions for their sizes , and to be abnormally round for their luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> this is true of the objects in our sample once we account for the fact that the most luminous galaxies ( @xmath7 ) , and bcgs , become slightly less round with increasing luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the shapes of the most luminous galaxies suggest that they formed from radial mergers , and the shapes of the most luminous objects in our big-@xmath3 sample suggest that they are the densest of these objects , viewed along the major axis .    </S>",
