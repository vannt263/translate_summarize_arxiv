    "moreover , this homeomorphism preserves the total turning of curves unless @xmath444 , in which case it reverses the sign .",

    "the proof that @xmath1473 , however , needs to be modified , since we have relied on .",
    "the idea is again to apply construction [ c : excavator ] , but to all of @xmath5 , not just to some of its arcs as in the proof of .",
    "if @xmath5 is a critical curve , then the corresponding function @xmath273 ( see figure [ f : excavator ] ) will attain the values @xmath184 , and at these points we need to assign weights , corresponding to the lengths of the line segments where @xmath572 attains its maximum and minimum .",
    "then we redefine @xmath1474 as the sum of the area under the graph of @xmath671 plus the weight at @xmath473 minus the weight at @xmath1475 .",
    "the process described in [ c : excavator ] will transform @xmath273 into a bounded function of the same area , that is , it will decrease the amplitude of @xmath5 , making it a condensed curve .",
    "the proofs of , and [ c : criticallocation ] , which deal with the existence of condensed and critical curves , go through unchanged ; the only difference in the conclusions is that the corresponding regions @xmath1476 , @xmath1259 and @xmath1477 of the plane are now closed , instead of open .",
    "thus , in the analogue of , the region of figure 1 should contain the two circles of radius 2 , but not the circle of radius 4 , and we can not assert that @xmath549 and @xmath1470 are homeomorphic to @xmath186 , only that they are weakly contractible .",
    "the rest of the statement and the proof hold without modifications .",
    "similarly , the version of for @xmath376 states that this space has one contractible connected component for each realizable total turning when @xmath54 .",

    "unfortunately , this is false .",
    "suppose for instance that we apply the homeomorphism @xmath1502 to the dubins path in figure [ f : faster](b ) .",
    "it should be clear that its image , which again consists of a line segment and two arcs of circles of opposite orientation with the same amplitude as before , does not minimize length in @xmath1503 , since in the latter space it is generally much more efficient to curve to the left than to the right , even if this yields a path of greater total turning .    in spite of this difficulty",
