    "geochemical analyses of the so - called snc meteorites suggest the existence of three to four separate and isotopically distinct reservoirs in the martian mantle , which have been preserved over the entire planetary evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two of these reservoirs are depleted in incompatible elements and are most likely situated in the mantle , whereas the third one is enriched and could be located either in the crust or in the mantle @xcite . until present ,",
    "most of the dynamical simulations of mars mantle convection did not account for the formation or preservation of such reservoirs , and focused mainly on explaining , for instance , the crustal dichotomy or the tharsis bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "scenarios that consider the early formation of chemical heterogeneities in the martian mantle assume either a global magma ocean @xcite , or at least substantial partial melting in the earliest phase of the planet s evolution @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that early in the evolution of mars , the large amount of primordial heat due to accretion , core formation , and possibly short lived radioactive elements can give rise to a magma ocean as a consequence of significant or perhaps even complete melting of the mantle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this assumption is confirmed by studies on short - lived radionuclides such as @xmath2hf suggesting that the separation between silicates and iron occurred in the first million years after accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , estimates of the timescale of the process of core formation suggest that , to achieve rapid separation , both silicates and metals need to be fluid , at least in the upper part of mantle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in general , the magma ocean freezes from the bottom ( i.e. from the cmb , if it comprises the entire mantle ) to the surface because of the steeper slope of the mantle adiabat compared to the slope of the solidus ( e.g. , * ?",
    "@xcite discusses two main freezing mechanisms : equilibrium and fractional crystallization , depending on the size and the settling velocity of crystals that form upon solidification . in the case of equilibrium crystallization , the crystal size and the settling velocities are so small that freezing takes place before crystal - melt separation occurs .",
    "the magma ocean solidifies without differentiating and a chemically homogeneous mantle is formed . in the case of fractional crystallization , instead , denser cumulates are formed while the crystallization of the magma ocean proceeds from the bottom , mainly because of iron enrichment in the evolving magma ocean liquid @xcite .",
    "the consequence is the formation of an unstably stratified density profile .",
    "whether equilibrium or fractional crystallization in a magma ocean is the dominant process also depends on the time scale of freezing and may change with time .",
    "a large degree of melting of the mantle implies a very low viscosity of the magma ocean .",
    "the viscosity of a melt / crystal mixture increases abruptly near a critical crystal fraction as suggested by theoretical and experimental studies of concentrated suspensions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by experiments with partial melts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this sudden increase in viscosity is defined by the so - called `` rheological transition '' , depends on the crystal size distribution , the crystal shape , and other factors .",
    "the critical crystal fraction for this transition varies in the literature .",
    "@xcite , using numerical models , found that for plagioclase crystals , the critical crystal fraction that allows a crystal network to form lies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 % .",
    "other studies place this transition at @xmath5% to @xmath0% depending on the basalt composition @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the rheological transition is assumed to take place at @xmath6 % . @xcite",
    "argues for instance that freezing of the earth s lower lasts only a few hundred years , until the crystal fraction becomes larger than the critical value marking the rheological transition . for larger crystal fractions , the time scale for",
    "further crystallization slows down by several orders of magnitudes ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 ma ) as the convection speed and cooling efficiency of the partially molten mantle is significantly reduced .",
    "fractional crystallization may become dominant at this stage . .",
    "therefore , depending on how the magma ocean freezes , i.e. via fractional or equilibrium crystallization , either a chemically homogeneous or stratified mantle is obtained and different evolutionary paths can be expected .",
    "so far , two end - member scenarios have been suggested in the literature for mars :    \\1 ) in the first scenario , it is assumed that this early melt produces a primordial crust and marks the start of the differentiation process . as the mantle residue is in general less dense than the primordial mantle , chemically distinct reservoirs can form depending on the density contrast between depleted and primordial mantle @xcite .",
    "typically , a depleted and compositionally buoyant upper mantle can develop , which overlies an undepleted and compositionally denser lower mantle @xcite .",
    "these two layers convect separately with the lower one that tends to become thinner with time because of erosion , while its composition remains almost primordial . however , whether or not this scenario can actually explain the isotopic characteristics of the martian meteorites is unclear and , to the best of our knowledge , it is a problem that still needs to be investigated .",
    "\\2 ) in the second scenario , the mantle freezes by fractional crystallization resulting in a stratification with fe - rich cumulates close to the surface and mg - rich cumulates at the cmb , a configuration that is gravitationally unstable .",
    "being highly incompatible , radioactive elements are enriched in the evolving residual liquid of the magma ocean .",
    "therefore , a substantial amount of radioactive heat - sources is concentrated in the uppermost layer of mars mantle @xcite .",
    "the unstable layering results then in an global mantle overturn , which has been estimated to take place within @xmath9 ma @xcite . as a consequence of the overturn",
    ", the dense surface material sinks to the core - mantle boundary , while the light material from the cmb rises to the surface , thus leading to a stable , chemically layered mantle .",
    "it is further assumed that , during the overturn , rising upwellings can melt by adiabatic decompression and produce an early crust .",
    "the residual mantle of this process has been associated with the source region of the nakhlites @xcite .",
    "the chemical layering following the overturn suppresses subsequent thermally driven convection and early - formed reservoirs are preserved throughout the planet s history . in this way ,",
    "distinct reservoirs can be maintained stable over the rest of the thermal evolution of mars .",
    "an important feature of the mantle overturn is also the subduction of the dense surface material .",
    "the first models with which this process was investigated @xcite assumed a small viscosity contrast between the interior and the surface , implicitly allowing for the mobilization of the surface layers .",
    "a small viscosity contrast can be the consequence of high surface temperatures maintained during the solidification phase of the magma ocean .",
    "in fact , a large amount of volatiles is expected to be outgassed , thereby forming a steam atmosphere able to keep the surface temperature even above the solidus of silicates @xcite . however , whether and how long a thick proto - atmosphere can be preserved is unclear since atmospheric loss processes are likely to be enhanced in the early stage of planetary evolution due to a stronger solar activity .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite    another possibility to obtain surface mobilization , even in the presence of low surface temperatures , is by lithospheric failure .",
    "only recently it has been shown that rising upwellings in the early stage of the overturn can localize surface deformation , inducing lithospheric - scale yielding and consequent surface mobilization @xcite .",
    "these models , however , used for simplicity either a linear unstable density profile @xcite , or a density profile in which phase transitions were neglected @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an approximation of the viscosity law , the so - called frank - kamenetskii approximation ( f - k ) , which can result in an underestimation of shallow viscosity gradients , is commonly used @xcite .",
    "we will show that considering a density profile that accounts for phase transitions , as well as a more appropriate strongly temperature - dependent rheology and a plastic deformation mechanism , the overturn tends to be confined below a stagnant lid and does not lead to a mobilization of the surface layers .",
    "the findings of the present study demonstrates the difficulty to find plausible scenarios to fit results from geochemical and isotope analyses with those of geodynamical modelling .",
    "we assume that the amount of heat generated by accretion and core formation processes has been large enough during the early planetary evolution to melt the whole mantle , creating a global magma ocean .",
    "subsequent cooling and fractional crystallization of the magma ocean results in a stratified and gravitationally unstable mantle .",
    "we assume that the initial steam atmosphere created during the magma ocean crystallization phase is entirely lost at the time when the magma ocean has fully crystallized ( @xcite ) , such that the surface temperature is set to a present day value of @xmath10 k.    the density profile established after freezing of the magma ocean is a crucial parameter , since it can dominate the entire dynamic and even suppress thermal buoyancy .",
    "however , such a profile is poorly constrained and varies in the literature from a linear function of the mantle depth @xcite to a more complex one , strongly depending on the mantle mineralogy @xcite . in order to test the effects of the initial density profile and to compare our results with previous models , we compare in the following three different profiles ( figure [ fig_all_profiles ] ) .",
    "we run one simulation assuming an unstable linear profile . for this",
    "we use the density contrast from @xcite calculated at a reference temperature of @xmath11 c. therefore the linear profile has the same buoyancy ratio as the third profile presented below .",
    "a second run is performed using the initial density profile from @xcite that also considers the formation of a dense garnet layer in the mid - mantle .",
    "the models presented in @xcite and in subsequent studies @xcite assume a simplified approach appropriate to simulate the overturn but not the subsequent thermal evolution : major mantle phase transitions are only indirectly considered by shifting the lower mantle material above the phase transition depth , adjusting its density profile accordingly and setting the initial density value in the lower mantle to the recalculated profile . therefore , although majorite and @xmath12-olivine are actually the minerals in the lower mantle , the density profile is recalculated using the corresponding volume fraction and the density values of olivine , pyroxene and garnet  main constituents of the upper mantle ( see dashed line in figure [ fig_magmaocean_profile]a ) .",
    "furthermore , the dashed profile in figure [ fig_all_profiles ] accounts for the material being at the solidus temperature  thus , the density ( dashed line in figure [ fig_magmaocean_profile]a ) is further reduced in contrast to the mantle material at reference conditions .    in a third simulation , we compute the initial density distribution using the reference density values from @xcite and the mantle mineralogy , i.e. magnesium number and volume percent of each phase ( olivine , garnet , pyroxene , majorite and @xmath12-olivine ) from @xcite . the resulting profile is shown in figure [ fig_magmaocean_profile]a .",
    "since we are also interested in the evolution after the magma ocean crystallization and overturn , we use densities at @xmath13 atm and @xmath11 c rather than @xmath13 atm and solidus temperature , which would be valid only in the overturn phase .",
    "additionally , we account in our models for the transition from garnet and pyroxene to majorite and olivine to @xmath12-olivine . as in the model of @xcite",
    ", we assume for simplicity that all phase transitions occur at a pressure of @xmath14 gpa equivalent to the depth of @xmath15 km in mars .",
    "we calculate the density difference of the mantle material according to the magnesium number and the volume percent of each phase ( figure [ fig_magmaocean_profile]b ) .",
    "therefore , when material of the shallow regions of the mantle sinks to the core - mantle boundary , garnet , pyroxene and olivine increase their density as a consequence of the transition to majorite and @xmath12-olivine . for material from the deep regions containing @xmath12-olivine and majorite and rising to shallower depths ,",
    "the density is reduced according to the phase transition .",
    "although the transition from pyroxene and garnet to majorite is slightly endothermic , on average , the transition of all phases is exothermic ( @xcite ) .",
    "the exothermic behavior is taken into account in such a way that the phase transition in cold downwellings takes place at a shallower depth compared to hot upwellings .",
    "we model the thermo - chemical convection of mars mantle by solving the conservation equations of mass , momentum , energy and composition .",
    "these are scaled as usual using the thickness of the mantle @xmath16 as length scale , the thermal diffusivity @xmath17 as time scale , the temperature drop @xmath18 and the maximum chemical density contrast @xmath19 across the mantle as temperature and compositional scales . using the extended boussinesq approximation ( eba ) , a newtonian rheology and an infinite prandtl number , as appropriate for highly viscous media with negligible inertia , the non - dimensional equations of thermo - chemical convection read : @xmath20 + ( ra t - ra_c c ) \\vec{e}_r - \\nabla p & = & 0\\label{eq_mantle_convection2}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial t } + \\vec{u } \\cdot \\nabla t - di(t+t_{surf})u_r - \\nabla ^2",

    "the three rayleigh numbers read : @xmath32 in all simulations we use a fixed surface temperature , a cooling boundary condition at the core - mantle boundary , and decaying radioactive heat sources . similarly to the model of @xcite , the concentration of long - lived elements is taken from @xcite .",

    "our pic implementation has been tested using various benchmark runs of increasing complexity in both 2d cylindrical and 3d spherical geometry @xcite . in our simulations",
    "each particle has its own density ( @xmath60 ) value .",

    "when a particle crosses the phase boundary calculated from equation ( [ eq_phases ] ) , it is assigned an appropriate density jump .",
    "note that we neglected the release and consumption of the latent heat associated with the phase change .",
    "for an exothermic transition like the one assumed here , this results in an slight overestimation of its enhancing effect on mantle flow .",
    "we apply the thermo - chemical mantle convection model to simulate magma ocean cumulate overturn assuming three different density profiles ( figure [ fig_all_profiles ] ) . if not otherwise specified , the viscosity is calculated using an activation energy of @xmath68 kj / mol , as appropriate for dry olivine @xcite , and applying the arrhenius law ( equation ( [ eq_viscosity ] ) ) .",
    "this causes the formation of a stagnant lid , which can be mobilized when considering a plastic rheology ( equation ( [ eq_viscosity_pt ] ) ) .",
    "the initial temperature profile is the same in all tests and follows the mantle solidus , apart for a thin upper thermal boundary layer with a thickness of @xmath4 km ( black line in figure [ fig_density_profiles]a ) .",
    "we investigate first the influence of the initial chemical density profile on the cumulate overturn of an unstably stratified mantle using a strongly temperature - dependent viscosity and taking into account plastic behaviour .",

    "in contrast to previous studies in which simulations are started from a stable configuration , i.e. after the magma ocean overturn , here we start with an unstable profile with the densest material located at the top . due to the temperature dependence of the viscosity ,",
    "dense material lying initially just beneath the stagnant lid sinks into the deep mantle while lighter material rises to the surface .",
    "the convective stresses created by both the light material which rises to shallower depths and the return flow due to the sinking of heavy cumulates are high enough to overcome the imposed yield stress .",
    "the lithosphere experiences plastic yielding and the initially unstable chemical gradient evolves into a stable configuration .",

    ", the overturn is nearly completed . during such whole - mantle",
    "overturn , relatively long - wavelength convection , involving all mantle layers is observed .",
    "afterwards , small scale convection patterns prevail and may persist for some time until eventually a perfect layering is reached .",
    "note that the thermal buoyancy is not strong enough to overcome the stable chemical gradient during the @xmath70 ga . all radioactive heat sources are located at the core - mantle boundary layer and heat significantly the lowermost mantle .",
    "the second profile corresponds to the fractional crystallization sequence , including a dense garnet layer in the mid - mantle , but neglects the effect of a mineralogical phase transition and is calculated at the solidus temperature as in @xcite .",
    "although this density profile is unstable as the linear density profile , whole - mantle overturn does not occur within @xmath8 ma and excludes the upper dense layer .",
    "surface mobilization is not observed in contrast to the linear density profile .",
    "the cause for this is that the densest material is trapped in the stagnant lid below which the chemical gradient is not large enough to generate the necessary convective stresses for breaking the lithosphere .",
    "the overturn takes place only below the lid , while the entire amount of heat sources and the densest materials remain at the top .",
    "we have also tested the robustness of this finding running additional calculations and assuming a thinner initial thermal boundary layer . as the stagnant lid grows rapidly ,",
    "similar results have been obtained showing that dense and enriched materials remain in the stagnant lid .",
    "upon overturn , the dense garnet layer located in the mid - mantle sinks to the core - mantle boundary .    in the third case , the density profile considering phase transitions is even more unfavorable for whole - mantle overturn than the previous one .",
    "similarly to the second simulation , the overturn only involves the mantle below the stagnant lid . upwelling material from the lower part of the mantle is blocked by lighter cumulates residing in the upper part .",
    "the garnet layer located in the upper mantle changes its density only slightly when undergoing the phase transition at greater depths .",
    "exchange can only take place during the overturn and ceases as soon as a stable configuration is reached in the lower part of the mantle .",
    "the mantle then cools rapidly to a conductive state as shown in figure [ fig_magmaocean_evolution ] and melting in the upper mantle only occurs during the first @xmath71 ma .      in the following models we only use the third chemical density profile discussed in the previous section , and investigate the effects of the rheological law .",
    "it is important to note that the results presented in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are strongly influenced by the rheological parameters used .",
    "for example , the use of a low activation energy and high surface temperature , or of a small viscosity contrast all contribute to considerably reduce global viscosity contrasts .",
    "in @xcite , the use of an activation energy of only @xmath8 kj / mol and a surface temperature above @xmath71 k results in a viscosity contrast of about three orders of magnitude , which shifts the convection regime from stagnant- to sluggish - lid , in which also the surface layer becomes mobile .",
    "in contrast to our findings , the densest material located at the surface overturns because of the mobilization of the lithosphere .",
    "however , the use of the f - k approximation is highly debated , especially when considering plastic yielding as it can alter the viscosity profile in the lithosphere , leading to erroneous results @xcite .",
    "indeed , when we use the arrhenius law with an activation energy of @xmath68 kj / mol and a surface temperature of @xmath10 k , the lithosphere remains rigid and does not experience plastic deformation . in figure [ fig_viscosity ]",
    "we plot the temperature and chemical density profiles from both runs after @xmath10 ma . in the arrhenius case",
    ", the overturn occurs below the stagnant lid , while in the f - k case also the uppermost dense layers sink to the cmb .",
    "this can be seen both in the chemical density profile where the densest material is at the cmb , as well as in the temperature profile , where the cold surface material carried along by the chemically dense upper layer lies in the lower part of the mantle .",
    "the garnet layer rises to shallower depths only if surface mobilization takes place . in the absence of dense cumulates sinking from the top of the mantle to produce a strong return flow ,",
    "this layer remains approximately at its original depth ( compare figure [ fig_viscosity]b and [ fig_viscosity]d ; for a more detailed time evolution of the garnet layer see online supplementary material ) .",
    "dynamically , this is quite the opposite as what observed in the models presented by @xcite , where this garnet - rich layer shifts to the upper mantle during the overturn phase , being pushed by the sinking uppermost dense material . during the overturn , the uppermost dense material sinks and accumulates at the cmb .",
    "the entire amount of heat sources , initially enriched in the uppermost @xmath0 km , resides , after the overturn , above the cmb . due to the stable density gradient established after the overturn ,",
    "thermal convection is difficult to maintain .",
    "although the upper mantle cools , the lower part of the mantle is strongly affected by the stable density gradient and by the enrichment of heat producing elements above the cmb .",
    "this results in a strong increase of the temperature to values that even exceed the liquidus ( figure [ fig_magmaocean_evolution]b ) .",
    "although our model does not include the effects of partial melting , we argue that even if melting were considered , the depth where this occurs would be below the density inversion depth @xcite where the melt , due to its compressibility , is negatively buoyant . therefore it would either remain in suspension with the silicate matrix or sink to the cmb .",
    "we have investigated the consequences of an unstable density profile resulting from fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean on the thermal evolution of mars .",
    "we have found that considering a temperature - dependent rheology , plastic yielding , and a surface temperature close to present - day value as suggested by recent modelling efforts @xcite , a global mantle overturn with surface mobilization is unlikely .",
    "this contrasts with the findings of @xcite who used a density profile that did not account for phase transitions , and a simplified viscosity approximation . mars most likely",
    "has been operating in a stagnant lid regime over its entire evolution .",
    "the densest cumulates remained trapped in the stagnant lid and only an overturn below it took place .",
    "the underlying mantle evolved into two regions separated by the garnet layer .",
    "convection and partial melting ceased during the first @xmath13 ga since the majority of the heat sources are also trapped in the stagnant lid .",
    "although stable chemical reservoirs form early in the evolution  as required by the isotopic data of the martian meteorites ",
    "the described scenario has several drawbacks that appear to be inconsistent with our current knowledge of the planet .",
    "the strong chemical gradient implied by fractional crystallization @xcite surppresses convection and partial melting . on the one hand , it is difficult to trace any reservoir in the lower part of the mantle . on the other hand , the rapid decline of convection and partial",
    "melting is at odds with the expected long - lived volcanic activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a dense primordial lid is difficult to reconcile with the low crustal density estimated for the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "such scenario is also not consistent with the formation of nakhlites as proposed in @xcite , since the garnet layer can not rise to shallow depths and the material most likely will not experience high melt fractions for garnet segregation to occur .",
    "although we argue that surface mobilization at the end of the magma ocean phase is unlikely , it remains a possibility that can not be ruled out .",
    "for instance , a dense atmosphere and a high surface temperature close to or higher than the solidus of silicates may allow surface material to be mobilized  this requires the overturn of the magma ocean within a time shorter than @xmath57 ma @xcite .",
    "similarly , external processes such as impacts may trigger the instability of the upper dense layer . in that case , the whole mantle overturn leads to a stable density profile characterized by a basal layer highly enriched in radiogenic heat sources .",
    "this results in a strong overheating of the lower mantle up to above the liquidus temperature .",
    "the melt generated in this lower part of the mantle is highly enriched in iron , since the densest layer contains iron - rich cumulates .",
    "moreover , this melt is located below the density inversion depth ",
    "the depth below which melt is denser than the surrounding silicate matrix . .",
    "therefore , we speculate that this melt would remain trapped in the lower part of the mantle and , because of the slow cooling of this region , would probably persist until recent times ( perhaps until present ) .",
    "the upper mantle instead rapidly cools to a conductive state due to the absence of heat sources .",
    "volcanic activity is expected to end in the first few hundred million years , at odds with the martian volcanic history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in both described scenarios ,",
    "i.e. whole mantle overturn and overturn below the stagnant lid , we obtain the formation of stable chemical reservoirs . nevertheless , because of the strong chemical gradient assumed by the fractional crystallization model @xcite , it is difficult to trace these reservoirs , particularly in the lower part of the mantle .",
    "furthermore , our results can not be reconciled with the subsequent thermo - chemical evolution of mars .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a purely fractional crystallization most likely did not take place",
    ". if a global magma ocean existed , a combination of fractional and equilibrium freezing , allowing for a smaller density constrast , appears more plausible .",
    "in fact , in recent study , @xcite shows that for a lower density gradient ( @xmath72 kg / m@xmath73 ) a chemical signature can be preserved in the lower part of the mantle , while convection homogenizes with time the upper mantle . in this case , the chemical heterogeneities can be traced by material entrainment from the deep reservoirs , while convection in the upper mantle may be responsible for late volcanic activity .",
    "another possibility would be that of a local or hemispherical magma ocean .",
    "this could be the result of a large impact in the early stage of the planetary evolution that has been for instance suggested to explain the crustal dichotomy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the impact heat accumulated during the late stage of planetary accretion can melt a significant part or even the entire mantle of a terrestrial body , giving rise to a global magma ocean . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent cooling of the interior causes the magma ocean to freeze rapidly from the core - mantle boundary ( cmb ) to the surface due to the steeper slope of the mantle adiabat compared to the slope of the solidus .    assuming fractional crystallization of the magma ocean , dense cumulates are produced close to the surface , largely due to iron enrichment in the evolving magma ocean liquid @xcite . a gravitationally unstable mantle thus forms , which is prone to overturn . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the cumulate overturn and its influence on the thermal evolution of mars using mantle convection simulations in 2d cylindrical geometry . </S>",
    "<S> we present a suite of simulations using different initial conditions and a strongly temperature - dependent viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that all radiogenic heat sources have been enriched during the freezing - phase of the magma ocean in the uppermost @xmath0 km and that the initial steam - atmosphere created by the degassing of the freezing magma ocean was rapidly lost , implying that the surface temperature is set to present - day values . in this case , a stagnant lid forms rapidly on top of the convective interior preventing the uppermost dense cumulates to sink , even when allowing for a plastic yielding mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> below this dense stagnant lid , the mantle chemical gradient settles to a stable configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the convection pattern is dominated by small - scale structures , which are difficult to reconcile with the large - scale volcanic features observed over mars surface and partial melting ceases in less than @xmath1 ma . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the stagnant lid can break because of additional mechanisms and allowing the uppermost dense layer to overturn , a stable density gradient is obtained , with the densest material and the entire amount of heat sources lying above the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> this stratification leads to a strong overheating of the lowermost mantle , whose temperature increases to values that exceed the liquidus . the iron - rich melt would most likely remain trapped in the lower part of the mantle . </S>",
    "<S> the upper mantle in that scenario cools rapidly and only shows partial melting during the first billion year of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a fractionated global and deep magma ocean is difficult to reconcile with observations . </S>",
    "<S> different scenarios assuming , for instance , a hemispherical or shallow magma ocean , or a crystallization sequence resulting in a lower density gradient than that implied by pure fractional crystallization will have to be considered .    </S>",
