    "lorentzian wormholes are supposed to provide connections either between otherwise separate universes or within a single universe .",
    "these wormholes should not possess horizons , like the einstein - rosen bridge @xcite or physical singularities .",
    "instead they should be smooth solutions of the einstein - matter equations with a nontrivial topology .",
    "the simplest such wormhole is the ellis wormhole @xcite .",
    "its throat is held open by the presence of a phantom field , i.e. , a scalar field with a reversed sign in front of its kinetic term . in einstein gravity",
    "this choice of sign is necessary in order to provide the required violation of the energy conditions .",
    "this was discussed in detail by morris and thorne @xcite , whose motivation was to obtain traversable wormhole solutions in general relativity . in recent years phantom fields have become ubiquitous in cosmology , providing one of the explanations for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "while wormholes present a fascinating subject with their potential impact on space travel and the possibility of time travel @xcite , they may also be viewed more mundane as potential astrophysical objects that may be searched for observationally @xcite . in this respect , wormholes have for instance been considered as gravitational lenses , as first addressed in @xcite , whose einstein rings @xcite or shadows @xcite have been studied .",
    "but also neutron star  wormhole systems and their possible astrophysical signatures have been addressed @xcite .",
    "astrophysical objects generically carry spin .",
    "however , all of the smooth wormhole solutions of the einstein - matter equations obtained so far ( in four space - time dimensions ) , are either static or slowly rotating perturbative solutions @xcite . thus we here present for the first time a family of globally regular stationary wormhole solutions . these represent the rotating generalizations of the ellis wormholes .",
    "we determine their domain of existence and analyze their physical properties .",
    "we note , that the family of rotating wormholes ends in an extremal kerr black hole , and conclude , that it is a generic feature of families of wormholes in einstein gravity to end in extremal black hole solutions .",
    "we consider einstein gravity coupled to a phantom field @xmath0 with action @xmath1 \\sqrt{-g } d^4x \\ , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 denotes the curvature scalar , @xmath3 is newton s constant , @xmath4 is the determinant of the metric , and @xmath5 represents a mass scale .    to construct stationary rotating wormhole solutions of this action",
    "we employ the line element @xmath6                      + h \\sin^2\\theta \\left(d\\varphi -{{\\omega}}dt\\right)^2\\right ) \\ , \\label{lineel}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions only of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is an auxiliary function .",
    "we note , that the coordinate @xmath11 takes positive and negative values , i.e.  @xmath14 .",
    "the limits @xmath15 correspond to two distinct asymptotically flat regions .",
    "the phantom field @xmath0 depends only on the coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as well .",
    "substitution of these anstze into the einstein equations leads to a system of non - linear partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "the pde for the function @xmath8 decouples and has a simple form @xmath16 a solution which satisfies the boundary conditions @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 .    for the phantom field",
    "we then find with @xmath19 the pde @xmath20 an explicit solution is @xmath21 , where the constant @xmath22 represents the scalar charge of the wormhole solution .",
    "the remaining equations yield a set of 3 pdes for the functions @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 together with an equation for the scalar charge and a constraint equation .",
    "we solve these pdes numerically , while monitoring the fulfillment of the constraint and the constancy of the scalar charge .",
    "we here focus on symmetric wormholes , where @xmath7 and @xmath9 are even functions of @xmath11 .",
    "their throat is located at the hypersurface @xmath23 , which represents a minimal surface .",
    "the equatorial radius @xmath2 of the throat is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 , while the polar radius @xmath26 and the areal radius @xmath27 are obtained via @xmath28 denoting the angular velocity of the throat by @xmath29 , the dimensionless rotational velocity of the throat is given by @xmath30    the mass @xmath31 and angular momentum @xmath32 of the wormhole solutions are obtained from the asymptotic form of the metric tensor components @xmath33    in order to establish a relation between the mass and the angular momentum , i.e. , a smarr - type relation , we consider the integrals @xmath34\\right|_0^\\infty d\\theta d\\varphi } \\",

    "we note , that one can always arrange @xmath52 by adding a suitable constant . in this case @xmath53 .",
    "still , the region @xmath46 is asymptotically flat , as one can see by means of a simple coordinate transformation . in that case ,",
    "we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] the dimensionless mass and angular momentum of the family of symmetric rotating wormholes , evolving from the static ellis wormhole .",
    "as the dimensionless rotational velocity @xmath55 reaches its maximal value , @xmath56 , the hypersurface @xmath23 changes its character and a degenerate horizon forms .",
    "the limiting configuration represents an extremal kerr black hole .",
    "the scalar charge on the other hand is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath55 , which vanishes in the limit @xmath56 , as it should for a kerr black hole .",
    "indeed , the phantom field vanishes identically in the limit .",
    "accordingly , the smarr - type relation ( [ smarr ] ) holds for kerr black holes in the extremal limit , when @xmath57 denotes the horizon angular velocity .    when the spherically symmetric ellis wormhole is set into rotation , the throat deforms .",
    "in particular , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] , the ratio of the polar radius to the equatorial radius @xmath58 decreases monotonically and assumes the value of the ratio of the corresponding extremal kerr horizon radii in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "the same holds for the areal radius @xmath27 . beyond a certain value of @xmath55",
    "the gaussian curvature turns negative at the poles of the throat , as indicated by the crosses in the figure .",
    "interestingly , this occurs for the same value of the ratio @xmath58 for the wormholes as for the kerr black holes , and likewise for the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "following @xcite we consider the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) by evaluating the quantity @xmath61 with null vector @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath63 is non - positive the nec is violated everywhere . introducing a global scale invariant measure for the nec violation , @xmath64",
    ", we observe a monotonic decrease of @xmath65 with increasing rotation velocity @xmath55 .    to extract the quadrupole moment @xmath66 of the rotating wormhole solutions we follow geroch and hansen @xcite and extract it from the asymptotic expansion in appropriate coordinates ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we recall , that the dimensionless quadrupole moment @xmath67 of the kerr solutions is constant , @xmath68 .",
    "the dimensionless quadrupole moment @xmath67 of the family of rotation wormhole solutions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] . it is smaller than the kerr value for slow rotation while it exceeds the kerr value for fast rotation . in the limit @xmath59 , however , the kerr value is attained .",
    "the dimensionless moment of inertia of the kerr solutions is bounded and given by @xmath69 . for rotating wormholes",
    ", however , @xmath70 rises without bound in the limit of slow rotation , since the static ellis wormhole has @xmath71 .",
    "rotating wormholes possess an ergoregion , defined by the condition @xmath72 , @xmath73 while the rotation axis is excluded from the ergoregion , its boundary in the equatorial plane is closely related to the angular velocity @xmath74 of the throat .",
    "the numerical calculations yield with high accuracy the relation @xmath75 .",
    "thus an ergoregion exists in the asymptotically flat region , where @xmath76 , only for sufficiently fast rotation , while there always exists an ergoregion in the asymptotically flat region , where @xmath10 tends to a finite value .",
    "the ergoregion is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] .",
    "in contrast to the static ellis wormhole , rotating wormholes possess stable bound orbits . indeed",
    ", there are two types of bound orbits , those that always remain within a single universe , and those that oscillate between the two universes .",
    "an example of such a two - world bound orbit is seen in fig .",
    ". for corotating orbits the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) resides at the throat . for counterrotating orbits , however , the radius of the isco depends on the rotation velocity , with the ratio @xmath77 increasing almost by a factor of two from the static limit to the extremal kerr black hole . at the same time",
    "the ratio of the orbital period @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the orbital period of the throat ( or the horizon of the extremal black hole ) , increases roughly by a factor of three .",
    "while wormholes with phantom fields have been studied in numerous respects ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , we have here provided the first globally regular rotating wormhole solutions and analyzed their physical properties , such as their global charges including their quadrupole moments and moments of inertia , as well as the properties of their throats . in particular",
    ", we obtained a smarr - type relation for these wormholes .    with increasing rotation velocity the violation of the nec decreases .",
    "the family of rotating wormholes then ends in an extremal kerr black hole .",
    "we note , that it seems to be a generic feature , that the families of generalized ellis wormholes end in an extremal black hole .",
    "in particular , charged static ellis wormholes in 4 dimensions end in an extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite , while rotating ellis wormholes in 5 dimensions end in an extremal myers - perry black hole @xcite .",
    "while the solutions presented are symmetric , in general rotating wormholes need not be symmetric . by choosing non - symmetric boundary conditions for the metric function @xmath7 , families of rotating wormholes emerge , which have different masses associated to their two asymptotically flat regions , as manifest already in the static case . as the asymmetry increases ,",
    "the wormhole properties change .",
    "but no matter how asymmetric the solutions are , these families always appear to end in an extremal kerr black hole .",
    "concerning the stability of the wormhole solutions , it is known that the static ellis wormholes are unstable @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued , that rotating wormholes might be stable @xcite .",
    "indeed , a stability analysis of five - dimensional rotating wormholes has shown , that the unstable mode of the static solutions disappears , when the rotation is sufficiently fast @xcite . whether this will happen as well in four dimensions still needs to be shown .",
    "on the other hand , stability might also be achieved by allowing higher curvature terms in the action @xcite .",
