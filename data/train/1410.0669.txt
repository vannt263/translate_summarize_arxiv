    "physiological signals are signals that are measured from sensors that are either placed on or implanted into the body .",
    "such physiological signals include those obtained using electromyography ( emg ) , electrocardiography ( ecg ) , electroencephalography ( eeg ) , photoplethysmography ( ppg ) , and ballistocardiography ( bcg ) .",
    "the processing and interpretation of such signals is challenging due to a number of different factors .",
    "for example , it is often difficult to obtain high - fidelity physiological signals due to noise , resulting in low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "traditionally , signal averaging and linear filters such as band - reject and band - pass filters have been used to process such physiological signals to suppress noise ; however , such approaches have also been shown to result in signal degradation  @xcite .",
    "as such , more advanced methods for handling such physiological signals are desired .",
    "multi - scale decomposition has become an invaluable tool for the processing of physiological signals . in multi - scale decomposition",
    ", a signal is decomposed into a set of signals , each characterizing information about the original signal at a different scale .",
    "a common signal processing task that multi - scale decomposition has shown to provide significant benefits is noise suppression , based on the notion that the information pertaining to the noise component would be largely characterized by certain scales that are separate from the scales characterizing the desired signal .",
    "much of literature in multi - scale decomposition for physiological signal processing has focused on scale - space theory  @xcite and wavelet transforms  @xcite , with some investigations also conducted using methods such as empirical mode decomposition  @xcite .    in scale - space theory",
    "@xcite , a signal @xmath0 is decomposed into a single - parameter family of @xmath1 signals , denoted by @xmath2 , with a progressive decrease in fine scale signal information between successive scales :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 denotes time , @xmath5 denotes scale , @xmath6 is the signal at the @xmath7 scale , and @xmath8 . by decomposing a signal into a set of signals with a progressive decrease in fine scale signal information between successive scales , one can then analyze signals at coarser scales without the influence of fine scale signal information such as that pertaining to noise , which is mainly characterized at the finer scales .",
    "as such , one can utilize scale space theory to suppress noise in a signal by perform scale space decomposition on the signal and then treating one of signals at a coarser scale as the noise - suppressed signal .",
    "however , there are several limitations to the use of scale space theory for physiological signal processing pertaining to noise suppression .",
    "first , noise suppression using scale space theory requires the careful selection of which scale represents the noise - suppressed signal , which can be challenging .",
    "second , noise suppression using scale space theory does not facilitate for fine - grained noise suppression at the individual scales , which limits its overall flexibility in striking a balance between noise suppression and signal structural preservation .    in wavelet decomposition  @xcite",
    ", a signal @xmath0 is decomposed into a set of wavelet coefficients @xmath9 obtained using a wavelet transform @xmath10 :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the wavelet , @xmath13 is the dyadic dilation , and @xmath14 is the dyadic position .",
    "wavelet transforms has a number of advantages for the purpose of physiological signal processing , particularly pertaining to noise suppression .",
    "first , as signal information at different scales are better separated in the wavelet domain ( i.e. , signal information at one scale is not contained in another scale ) , this facilitates fine - grained noise suppression at the individual scales to strike a balance between noise suppression and signal structural preservation .",
    "second , scale selection when performing noise suppression using wavelet transforms is less critical than that for noise suppression using scale space theory , since all scales are considered in noise suppression using wavelet transforms as opposed to a single scale selection with scale space theory .",
    "one limitation worth noting pertaining to signal processing using wavelet transforms , particularly pertaining to noise suppression , is that signals processed using wavelet transforms can exhibit oscillation artifacts related to wavelet basis functions used in the wavelet transform , which is particular noticeable when dealing with low snr scenarios . therefore , given some of the limitations with both scale space theory and wavelet transforms when used for physiological signal processing , one is motivated to explore alternative approaches that can address these limitations .    here",
    ", we take a different approach by exploring a bayesian perspective to multi - scale signal decomposition . in this perspective",
    ", a signal is viewed as an amalgamation of a number of signals , each characterizing unique signal information at a different scale with different statistical characteristics .",
    "taking such a perspective to the problem of multi - scale signal decomposition has a number of advantages .",
    "first , like the wavelet transform , since signal information at one scale is not contained in another scale , it allows us to achieve the benefits of taking better advantage of fine - grained noise suppression at the individual scales to strike a balance between noise suppression and signal structural preservation .",
    "second , since signals are decomposed based on their statistical characteristics as opposed to a set of deterministic basis functions , signals processed using this approach would not exhibit the types of basis - related artifacts associated with the use of wavelet transforms . motivated by this , in this study , we investigate the feasibility of utilizing a new bayesian - based method for multi - scale signal decomposition called bayesian residual transform ( brt ) for the purpose of physiological signal processing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the methodology behind the proposed bayesian residual transform is described in section  [ methods ] . the experimental setup for evaluating the feasibility of using the brt for suppressing noise in physiological signals via signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) analysis using electrocardiography ( ecg )",
    "signals is described in section  [ setup ] .",
    "the experimental results and discussion is presented in section  [ results ] , and conclusions are drawn and future work discussed in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "a full derivation of the proposed bayesian residual transform ( brt ) can be described as follows . in the brt",
    ", a signal @xmath0 is modeled as the summation of @xmath1 residual signals , each characterizing signal information from the signal at increasingly coarse scales :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 denote a signal representing the summation of all residual signals at scales @xmath17 $ ] : @xmath18    and @xmath19 is a residual signal characterizing the signal information at the @xmath20 scale with different statistical characteristics .",
    "the residual signals at the lower scales contain fine - grained signal characteristics of the signal , while the residual signals at the higher scales contain coarse - grained signal characteristics of the signal ( e.g. , @xmath21 characterizes the finest - grained signal characteristics , while @xmath22 characterizes the coarsest - grained signal characteristics ) . as",
    "such , each residual signal contains unique information about the scale corresponding to a particular scale that the other residual signals do not contain .",
    "therefore , the goal of the brt ( denoted by the function @xmath23 ) is to decompose a signal @xmath0 into the set of @xmath1 residual signals @xmath24 :    @xmath25    determining the set of residual signals characterizing the signal information at the different scales and whose sum is equal to @xmath0 ( i.e. , eq .",
    "[ sumofprocesses ] ) is a highly challenging problem , and as such with the brt we wish to introduce a deep cascading framework to solve this problem in a more tractable manner , where a residual signal at a particular scale is computed based on computations performed at a previous scale .",
    "let us first rewrite eq .",
    "[ sumofprocesses ] as follows :    @xmath26    it can be observed from eq .",
    "[ process2 ] that the residual signal @xmath21 can be treated as the residual between the summation of all residual signals at scales @xmath27 $ ] and the summation of all residual signals at scales @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "hence , one can treat this as an inverse problem of estimating @xmath29 given @xmath30 , with the analytical solution given by the conditional expectation @xmath31  @xcite ( the quantification of the conditional expectation will be explained in more detail in a later section discussing the realization of the brt via kernel regression ) .",
    "therefore , given @xmath32 , one can substitute @xmath33 for @xmath34 in eq .",
    "[ process2 ] and rearrange the terms to obtain @xmath21 as :    @xmath35    given @xmath33 , which is computed to obtain @xmath21 , we can express the relationship between @xmath36 and @xmath33 in a similar manner to eq .",
    "[ process2 ] as :    @xmath37    which can similarly be treated as an inverse problem of estimating @xmath38 given @xmath33 , with the analytical solution given by the conditional expectation @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , given @xmath40 , one can express @xmath36 as :    @xmath41    generalizing this , @xmath42 at scale @xmath5 , for @xmath43 , can be obtained by    @xmath44    where @xmath45    the last residual signal is computed as @xmath46 to conform with the form expressed in eq .",
    "[ sumofprocesses ] . hence , given eq .",
    "[ estj ] , we have a deep cascading framework for the brt where we can obtain the residual signal at scale @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) given the previously computed @xmath47 . furthermore",
    ", since the residual signal at scale @xmath48 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) is not involved in the computation of the residual signal at scale @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) ( only @xmath47 obtained from previous cascading step is ) , the information contained within @xmath49 is not contained within @xmath50 . as such , as scale @xmath5 increases , the signal information contained in @xmath47 becomes coarser and coarser , which results in residual signals @xmath50 characterizing coarser and coarser signal information as scale increases .",
    "based on eq .",
    "[ estj ] , the deep cascading framework for the forward bayesian residual transform ( brt ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a .    due to the condition of the summation of residual signals at all scales being equal to signal @xmath0 ( eq .",

    ", we first establish a simple approach to noise suppression of signals using the brt for illustrative purposes . the noise suppression method chosen for this study",
    "is based around the idea that the observed noisy signal @xmath0 is formed as a summation of the desired noise - free signal @xmath58 and an additive noise source .",
    "suppose that we have the true noise - free signal @xmath58 and we decompose it using the brt into a series of residual signals @xmath24 , where each of the residual signals characterize only information from the noise - free signal at a particular scale .",
    "much of the information at each scale that characterizes the noise - free signal @xmath58 would be concentrated within only a few of the locations in each of the residual signals .",
    "what this means is that much of the information content related to @xmath58 is primarily concentrated within just a few locations at each scale .",
    "if we were to decompose the noisy signal @xmath0 using the brt in a similar fashion , the locations of the residual signal at each scale that would otherwise have negligible information content associated with @xmath58 would now have low but not negligible information content that characterizes the noise source .",

    "to illustrate the feasibility of utilizing the brt for processing physiological signals , such as for the task of noise suppression , we first performed the brt on two test signals : i ) a noisy periodic test signal , and ii ) a noisy piece - wise regular test signal .",
    "the multi - scale signal decomposition using the brt on a noisy periodic test signal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here",
    ", a baseline test signal ( fig .  [ fig2]a ) is contaminated by a zero - mean gaussian noise process to produce a noisy signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) and then decomposed using the brt at different scales ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]c - h ) .",
    "it can be observed that the noise process contaminating the signal is well characterized in the decompositions at the lower ( finer ) scales ( scales 1 to 3 ) , while the structural characteristics of the test signal is well characterized in the decompositions at the higher ( coarser ) scales ( scales 4 to 6 ) .        the multi - scale signal decomposition using the brt on a noisy piece - wise regular test signal ( generated using  @xcite ) is shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "as with the previous example , a baseline test signal ( fig .  [ fig3]a ) is contaminated by a zero - mean gaussian noise process to produce a noisy signal ( fig .",

    "[ fig3]c - h ) .",
    "it can be observed that , as with the periodic signal example , the noise process contaminating the signal is well characterized in the decompositions at the lower ( finer ) scales ( scales 1 to 2 ) , while the structural characteristics of the test signal is well characterized in the decompositions at the higher ( coarser ) scales ( scales 3 to 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , more noticeable here than in the periodic signal example , it can be seen that that the decomposition at each scale exhibits good signal structural localization .",
    "therefore , given the ability of the brt to decouple the noise process from the true signal into different scales , as illustrated in both the periodic and piece - wise regular test signals , the brt has the potential to be useful for performing noise suppression on signals while preserving inherent signal characteristics .    in this study ,",
    "to illustrate the feasibility of utilizing the brt for processing physiological signals , we introduced a simple thresholding approach to noise suppression using the brt for illustrative purposes ( * see section  [ noisesuppression ] * ) .",
    "we then performed a quantitative snr analysis using electrocardiography ( ecg ) signals from the mit - bih normal sinus rhythm database  @xcite to study the performance of the brt for the task of noise suppression , where the snr improvement ( * see section  [ noisesuppression ] for formulation * ) .    a plot of the mean snr improvement of the tested methods vs. the different input snrs ranging from 12 db to 2.5 db is shown in fig .",

    "it can also be observed that the uni method consistently achieved snr improvements below 0 db .",
    "this is primarily due to the tendency to overestimate the noise level , resulting in signal oversmoothing and thus producing a noise - suppressed signal that is less similar to the baseline signal than the actual noisy signal .",
    "it can also be observed that the snr improvement increases as the snr of the input noisy signal decreases , which indicates that greater benefits are obtained through the use of noise suppression methods in low signal snr scenarios .    to study the effect of the number of scales @xmath1 on noise suppression performance , a plot of the mean snr improvement vs. the different input snrs ranging from 12 db to 2.5 db for the method using the brt with a range of different number of scales @xmath1",

    "it can be observed that a significant gain in snr improvement exists going from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , with smaller snr improvement gains from @xmath84 all the way to @xmath85 .",

    "therefore , this indicates that the effect of selecting the number of scales on noise suppression performance can be significant and thus a balance between snr improvement and the computational complexity of the brt ( which grows linearly with the number of scales ) is necessary , particularly given the snr of the noisy signal .    to study the effect of the standard deviation ( sd ) used for @xmath80 on noise suppression performance , a plot of the mean snr improvement vs. the different input snrs ranging from 12 db to 2.5 db for the method using the brt with a range of different multiples of sd used for @xmath80",

    "<S> multi - scale decomposition has been an invaluable tool for the processing of physiological signals . </S>",
    "<S> much focus in multi - scale decomposition for processing such signals have been based on scale - space theory and wavelet transforms . in this study , we take a different perspective on multi - scale decomposition by investigating the feasibility of utilizing a bayesian - based method for multi - scale signal decomposition called bayesian residual transform ( brt ) for the purpose of physiological signal processing . in brt , a signal is modeled as the summation of residual signals , each characterizing information from the signal at different scales . </S>",
    "<S> a deep cascading framework is introduced as a realization of the brt . </S>",
    "<S> signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) analysis using electrocardiography ( ecg ) signals was used to illustrate the feasibility of using the brt for suppressing noise in physiological signals . </S>",
