    "the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate : the spin - wave branches exhibit an energy gap , i.e. , the magnons are no longer goldstone bosons as they become massive . in particle physics",
    "it is common to call such excitations _ pseudo - goldstone bosons_.    let us turn to the effective description of the @xmath2=2 + 1 antiferromagnet in presence of staggered and magnetic fields .",

    "apart from @xmath21 , a second low - energy effective constant appears in @xmath15 : the quantity @xmath22 that is related to the spin stiffness @xmath23 ( or helicity modulus ) by @xmath24 .",

    "the leading and next - to - leading effective lagrangians are lorentz - invariant . in view of the fact that the underlying bipartite lattices are not even space - rotation invariant ,",
    "why is our approach legitimate ?",
    "the first observation is that the leading piece @xmath15 is strictly ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant , the spin - wave velocity @xmath6 taking the role of the speed of light .",
    "this accidental symmetry emerges because lattice anisotropies only show up at order @xmath27 ( and beyond ) in the effective lagrangian @xcite . on the other hand , in @xmath29",
    "one should include all additional terms that are permitted by the lattice geometry .",
    "however , as we explain below , these effects only start manifesting themselves at next - to - next - to leading order in the low - temperature expansion which is beyond two - loop accuracy we pursue in the present evaluation .",
    "this perfectly justifies maintaining a ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant structure also in @xmath29 .    in the following we consider the scenario where the magnetic field points into a direction perpendicular to the staggered field , @xmath30 while we have chosen @xmath31 to point into the 1-direction",

    "the corresponding thermal propagators in euclidean space are given by @xmath39    we emphasize that the magnetic and staggered field are treated as perturbations that explicitly break o(3 ) invariance of the heisenberg hamiltonian . as long as these fields are weak , the o(3 ) symmetry still is approximate , and our basic setting is valid : it is conceptually consistent to start from the collinear antiferromagnetic ground state and interpret the two magnons as oscillations of the staggered magnetization order parameter .",
    "it is well - known , however , that in presence of magnetic fields perpendicular to the staggered magnetization , the spins get tilted , creating a canted ( non - collinear ) phase ( see , e.g. , refs .",
