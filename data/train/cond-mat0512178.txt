    "scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) has been widely used to study atomic and electronic structures of surface and atoms absorbed on it .",
    "a currently interesting topic is kondo effect of magnetic atoms on non - magnetic metal surface .",
    "the interest along this direction is motivated by recent advance in the construction of novel nano - structure device on surface .",
    "stm has been used to probe the kondo resonance of a single magnetic atom.@xcite the magnetic cobalt phthalocyanine molecule absorbed on au(111 ) surface shows kondo effect by having cut away eight hydrogen from the molecule .",

    "generally stm tunneling spectrum is nt exactly correspondent to the atomic and electronic structure of the surface . to obtain the realistic atomic and electronic structure from stm tunneling spectrum , it is valuable to establish a believable stm theoretical model that is related the realistic atomic structure or electronic structure to the stm tunneling spectrum",
    ". based on the tersoff alike theory,@xcite the differential conductance of electronic tunneling in stm is proportional to the local density of state(ldos ) of surface state .",
    "the resonance peak at zero - bias voltage in di / dv curve is generally the mixing of kondo resonance with other resonance such as d - resonance from 3d magnetic atom.@xcite the stm models based on anderson model have successfully explained the fano shape of kondo resonance using the equilibrium many - body theory  @xcite and non - equilibrium theory.@xcite    quantum tunneling of electrons in stm device is out of equilibrium in nature . in this paper , using a non - equilibrium self - consistent method , we calculate the stm tunneling spectra for magnetic atoms on metal surface .",
    "kondo effect can be solved using analytical or numerical methods , such as , the non - crossing approximations ( nca ) and other larger n methods are suited for the infinite u anderson model.@xcite the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) and the exact bethe ansatz need to linearize the dispersion relation near fermi energy after having simplified into one - dimension model.@xcite the method used in this paper is similar to the iterative perturbation theory ( ipt).@xcite the big difference is that in this work the kondo resonance peak is decoupled from other parts of the green function .",
    "however for ipt , the kondo resonance is imported into the green function of magnetic atom by interpolating @xmath1 self - energy into an appropriate self - energy ansatz .",
    "the decoupled scheme in this work can be obtained by more detail theoretical analysis such as in reference.@xcite    as a company of kondo resonance , the so - called zero - bias anomaly has contribution to the differential conductance near zero - bias voltage .",

    "the signals of kondo resonance from the di / dv curves are fano - line shapes and are the mixing of kondo resonance and dip structure due to zero - bias anomaly .",
    "this is well consistent with experimental observations .",
    "the zero - bias anomaly generally appears as a dip structure near zero - bias and is frequently covered by background noise .",
    "if other resonance peak appears at zero bias , the zero - bias anomaly can shows itself by modulating the resonance peak .",
    "this is why kondo resonance generally appears company with a local minimum in di / dv curves .",

    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) we can see that a peak appears at zero bias and it became flat at 240 k. it s just knodo resonance in tunneling spectrum . if the tip move away from the magnetic atom to empty parts of the surface , the tunneling spectrum is flat .",
    "the peak structure of kondo resonance and the flat spectrum for empty surface are celebrated because di / dv curve is correspondent to the density of state and close to the prediction of the standard tersoff s stm theory  @xcite .",
    "the dip structures are more common in stm tunneling spectrum .",
    "the energy - window of tunneling electrons has important influence on the shapes of di / dv curves .",
    "several theoretical works  @xcite have shown that , in order to obtain correct tunneling spectra , the calculations of tunneling matrix need to use an energy - cutoff above fermi energy to remove high - energy surface electrons .",
    "this is implicit that only part of electrons with proper energy - range can tunnel into the tip . at zero temperature ,",
    "there exists clear energy - window with the fermi energies of the tip and surface as its up - boundary and down - boundary .",
    "only electrons with energies in the window can transmit to the other side of the barrier between the tip and surface and tunnel into the tip .",
    "the tip ca nt capture high - energy electrons although they have already transmitted the barrier .    at finite temperature",
    ", the energy distribution of electron becomes smoothly across the fermi energy .",
    "we may add a skip - energy @xmath79 to define energy - window at finite temperature to include more electrons and cutoff electrons with higher energy .",
    "we alter the energy - window to [ -(ev@xmath80),(ev@xmath80 ) ] and calculate the di / dv curve again . the width of energy - window changes with the bias voltage .",
    "in fact cutoff effect of fermi energy has already included in our current formula by lesser green functions and self energies for non - interaction case .",
    "after self - consistent calculations the electronic interactions of different parts are introduced .",
    "the cutoff effect of lesser green functions becomes weak even at very low temperature and fermi distribution still allows high - energy electrons above fermi energy .",
    "we use the energy cutoff ev@xmath80 to neglect electrons with higher energies .",
    "the integral limits are symmetric around fermi energy . from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) , we can see that the dip structures appear when @xmath81 ( ev ) . for @xmath82",

    "we can also find from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) that energy - window effect is only effective near zero bias .",
    "if the minimum value of effective energy - window is larger than 0.02 ( ev ) , the influence of energy - window can be ignored .",
    "both the energy - window and energy - cutoff effects together determine the local minimum of di / dv curve at zero bias .",
    "we must analyze them more deeply . at large bias voltage",
    "@xmath83 the energies of most tunneling electrons are in energy - range from 0 ev to ev@xmath84 .",
    "the number of electrons with high - energies is relative small . at very small bias voltage ,",
    "the number of electrons within the energy - range is deceased to very small value . at this time , if we remove high - energy electrons the total difference conductance will has a large decrease .",
    "only @xmath79 less than 0.02 ev , in another word , more high - energy electrons are removed the local minimum near zero - bias is more prominent .",
    "we study a simplified stm model , that is , electrons transmits though a single barrier which is vacuum region between the tip and surface . from the insert figure of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) , the height of the barrier is @xmath85 and the energy of incident electron is @xmath86 . by standard quantum mechanic calculation ,",

    "the differential conductance is calculated by the landauer - bttiker type formula @xmath90 . from the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( b ) .",
    "we find the sharp dip structure for small barrier .",
    "the transmission coefficients increase with energies of tunneling electrons .",
    "compared with high - energy electrons , near zero bias the energies of tunneling electrons are small and the transmission coefficients are also small .",
    "the di / dv curves obtained from our model have similar shapes to the di / dv curves for the single barrier model is indicative that the dip structures are because the energies of tunneling near low bias locate in classic forbidden regime of the vacuum barrier between the tip and surface .",
    "we remove the high - energy electrons by introducing energy - cutoff is equivalent that we restrict the energies of tunneling electrons below the effective barrier and within classic forbidden regime near zero bias .",
    "the number of high - energy electrons is small , but their transmission coefficient is large . they will have important influence on differential conductance because if at low bias most of electrons have low energies and small transmission coefficient .",
    "although stm device has simple structure , many things are unclear such as the shape and size of tip .",
    "generally the tip ca nt capture all tunneling electrons . at low bias , most of electrons locate in low - energy regime",
    ". the high - energy electrons and low - energy electrons are in different energy - scale so high - energy events are irrelevant to low - energy events .",
    "this is the reason why we introduce energy - cutoff to remove high - energy electron .",
    "the realistic stm devices are more complex .",
    "we must known the exact information of surface state . of course",
    ", the directions of velocity of tunneling electrons also determine whether the tip can capture these tunneling electrons .",
    "thus we suggest that , to more close to realistic stm , we should add a captured probability factor @xmath91 into the current formula , and it can be written as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is transmission coefficient . in this paper , @xmath94 .",
    "this is just equivalent to the introduction of energy - window in our calculations .",
    "this is also equivalent to limit all tunneling matrixes with non - zero values only in this energy - window just like in reference .",
    "@xcite besides energy , @xmath95 could include position , momentum and any other more complex properties of stm device .    based on our results ,",
    "the dip structures in di / dv curve near zero - bias are induced by the tunneling among the tip , absorbed atom and surface because the energies of tunneling electrons are smaller than heights of effective barriers of corresponding tunneling process . not only most of many - body events but also subsequent single tunneling events are suppressed .",
    "the electronic tunneling events include subsequent single tunneling , co - tunneling and more complex tunneling process .",
    "if the background noises are reduced by proper method , the dip structure can be found in the di / dv curve .",
    "if there are magnetic atoms on surface , kondo resonance will enhance the differential conductance near zero bias , the dip structure has chance to be observed by modulating the shape of kondo resonance . thus the most of kondo resonance observed in stm tunneling spectra are modulated by a local minimum .      in this section we will study stm tunneling spectrum for the same parameters as in section a but we use a energy - cutoff from 0 ev to ev@xmath84 ( see fig .",

    "there is no dip structure in the density of the state of the nonmagnetic impurity and empty surface at the fermi energies .",

    "when kondo resonance happens in the present of magnetic impurity , there is a dip structure in the density of state of surface conducting electron [ fig.[fig3 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "this contributes an additional dip structure to di / dv curve , which mixes with the dip structure coming from dynamically tunneling .",
    "the dip structures have the widths with the same energy scale as the system temperature .",
    "if the kondo temperature is higher than system temperature , the kondo resonance is still modulated by the remain weaker dip structure [ see fig.[fig7 ] ] and the kondo resonance at first sight splits two peaks .",
    "the total shape of di / dv curve is the mixing of two splitting peaks and main strong dip structure .",
    "the change of the tunneling current of stm is very significant when we change the distance from the tip to surface .",
    "the tunneling matrix v or b represents the tunneling from the absorbed atom or the surface to the tip .",
    "v and b are proportional to @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the distance from the tip to point @xmath104 on the surface .",
    "the smaller is @xmath105 the larger is v or b. thus , when the tip continuously accesses the surface or adsorbed atom , the parameter v or b changes from smaller value to larger one . fig .  [ fig8](a ) illustrates the resonance peaks in di / dv curves become stronger and asymmetric when v increases from small to large values . in calculations ,",
    "we shift the kondo resonance about @xmath58 = 0.005 ev above fermi energy .",
    "we can also see that the kondo resonance appears more prominent at strong tunneling in di / dv curves . from fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) we also see that strong tunneling from surface to tip makes the shape of di / dv curves are more symmetric .",
    "this is because , at strong tunneling from the surface to tip , the role of the absorbed magnetic atom becomes less important .",
    "the electron - correlation interaction plays an important role for kondo effect . based on the yosida and yamada s calculations  @xcite , for strong coulomb interaction ( large u ) the kondo resonance sharp but weak with small area closed by the energy - axis . after having calculated the di / dv curves",
    ", we find the kondo resonance more peak alike but weak as having increased u from 2.0 ev to 4.0 ev .",
    "the stm tunneling spectra are obtained using the non - equilibrium self - consistent calculations . the di / dv curves have fano s shapes and are close to the experimental tunneling spectra of 3d transition - metal atoms on novel - metal surface . the kondo resonance in measurements di / dv curves generally are the mixture of pure kondo resonance and the dip structure due to others zero - bias anomaly such as the subsequent single tunneling , cotunneling and other more complex tunneling events in the stm device . if kondo resonance is strong the di / dv curve is peak near zero - bias voltage and its shape is modulated by a valley or dip . based on our model ,",
    "the energy - window of tunneling electron has significant influence on the tunneling spectrum at very near zero - bias .",
    "the energy - window effect is unimportant for large bias voltage .    on the one hand , anderson model",
    "cannt capture all information in detail on the stm device , but it still captures the most important properties of stm device .",
    "our calculations only provide the main characters of kondo resonance in stm device .",
    "more accurate calculations need to find a model more close to the real stm experiments and know the exact information on surface state .",
    "in this paper we have also developed a computational method of non - equilibrium electronic transport which is not only fit for stm device but also quantum dot , nano - molecule - device , hybridization system of normal metal and superconductor and others mesoscopic transport system .",
    "the self - consistent method can be extended to the system far beyond equilibrium by replace single - time integral and single - frequency fourier transformation with double - times integral and double - frequency fourier transformation .",
    "the method is suitable to the real time and real - space to study the pattern of tunneling spectrum on a surface .",
