    "experimental data on polarized structure functions @xmath8 have been accumulated for the last several years .",
    "the data with the proton , deuteron , and @xmath9he targets are now available and new data are expected to be given by rhic at bnl , compass at cern , and other facilities in the near future . in the light of such progresses and future projects , we should summarize present knowledge of polarized parton distribution functions by using all available data at this stage . for this purpose , we formed the group called asymmetry analysis collaboration ( aac ) and tried to determine the polarized parton distribution functions .    in this paper",
    ", we explain our analysis to determine optimum polarized distributions by @xmath1 fitting to the experimental data of spin asymmetry @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the discussions based on the work in ref.@xcite , we introduce a fortran library for our distributions as a recent progress .",
    "we determine initial polarized parton distributions at @xmath10 = 1.0 gev@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) . considering the counting rule , we adopt the following functional form : @xmath13 here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the polarized and unpolarized parton distributions , respectively and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are free parameters .",
    "these parameters are constrained by the positivity condition , @xmath20 .",
    "we simply apply it not only for the leading - order ( lo ) case but also for the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) case although it is valid only in lo .",
    "furthermore , we assume su(3 ) flavor - symmetric sea because we do nt have enough data to extract flavor dependence of polarized sea . under this assumption ,",
    "the first moments of @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be fixed by the axial charges for octet baryon , f and d. therefore , we should determine @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 distributions and total number of the parameters becomes 14 .    as the experimental data to which the parameters are fitted , we chose spin asymmetry @xmath2 instead of @xmath8 since @xmath2 is closer to direct observable in experiment rather than @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath2 is given by @xmath25}{f_{2}(x , q^2 ) } , \\ ] ] where , @xmath26 is the ratio of longitudinal to transverse cross - sections . in our analysis ,",
    "@xmath2 is calculated by using @xmath27 obtained by grv98 distributions , @xmath8 obtained by our parametrized distributions , and @xmath26 taken from the slac-1990 analysis .",
    "then , @xmath28 ^ 2/ [ \\sigma^{data}(x , q^2)]^2 $ ] is calculated and is minimized by the subroutine minuit . here , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 indicate the experimental @xmath2 , calculated @xmath2 , and experimental error , respectively .",
    "from the @xmath1 analysis , we obtain the results with @xmath1 = 322.6 in the lo case , and @xmath1 = 300.4 in the nlo case for 375 data points .",
    "the nlo @xmath1 is significantly smaller than the lo one .",
    "it suggests that the nlo analysis is necessary for precise analysis .",
    "the obtained @xmath2 for the proton and for the neutron at @xmath10 = 5.0 gev@xmath11 are shown in fig.[mm : fig1 ] with the experimental data .",
    "although the comparison is not straightforward because the data are taken at various @xmath10 , the obtained parameters reproduce the data well both in the lo and the nlo case . figure [ mm : fig2 ] show the obtained polarized parton distribution functions at @xmath10 = 1.0 gev@xmath11 . in our analysis , the first moment of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is fixed by positive ( negative ) value and the obtained distribution becomes positive ( negative ) .",
    "furthermore , antiquark and gluon distributions become negative and positive , respectivly .    for these distributions ,",
    "quark spin content becomes @xmath3 = 0.201 for lo and @xmath32 for nlo at @xmath10=1.0 gev@xmath11 .",
    "the nlo @xmath3 is significantly smaller than the lo one .",
    "it is also smaller than the generally quoted values in other analyses that range in 0.1 @xmath33 0.3 .",
    "the difference of @xmath3 comes mainly from the difference of @xmath34 in the small-@xmath4 region . because we do nt have a small-@xmath4 data at this stage",
    ", we should fix the small-@xmath4 behavior of @xmath34 from theoretical suggestions .",
    "we perform @xmath1 fitting by fixing the parameter @xmath35 , which controls the small-@xmath4 behavior of @xmath34 , to @xmath35 = 1.0 and 1.6 according to the predictions of the regge theory and the perturbative qcd .",
    "these values are rather larger than the value @xmath35 = 0.32 @xmath36 0.22 which is obtained by the previous nlo analysis . as a result , we get @xmath3 = 0.241 ( @xmath1 = 305.8 ) for @xmath35 = 1.0 and @xmath3 = 0.276 ( @xmath1 = 323.5 ) for @xmath35 = 1.6 . the obtained @xmath3 are larger than the previous nlo result and are within the usually quoted range . from these results ,",
    "we find that @xmath3 is very sensitive to the small-@xmath4 behavior of the antiquark distributions . in order to determine the quark spin content precisely ,",
    "the data in the small-@xmath4 region are needed . because @xmath1 for the @xmath35 = 1.0 case is close to the one for the previous nlo , this set can be also considered as a good parametrization .",
    "therefore , we propose three sets of distributions , lo , nlo with free @xmath35 ( nlo-1 ) , and nlo with @xmath35 = 1.0 ( nlo-2 ) , as aac polarized distribution functions .    finally , we briefly comment on the error estimate of the obtained distributions @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of our distributions can be estimated by using the error matrix which is obtained by minuit .",
    "the 1-@xmath37 boundary of the distribution @xmath38 is given by    @xmath39    where , @xmath40 is the error matrix element for parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this analysis is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "for practical application of our distributions , we provide a library program which is given as fortran subroutine aacpdf(iset , q2 , x , polpdf , struct ) .",
    "the users should call this subroutine in their programs with the input parameters iset , q2 , and x. this library contains three sets of distributions , lo , nlo-1 , and nlo-2 , and the parameter iset designates which set is used .",
    "when iset=1 , 2 , or 3 , the returned values are those in the lo , nlo-1 , or nlo-2 , respectively . the parameters q2 and x specify @xmath10 and bjorken-@xmath4 at which the distributions are calculated .",
    "the allowed ranges are 1.0 gev@xmath11 @xmath43 10@xmath44 gev@xmath11 and 10@xmath45 @xmath46 1.0 .",
    "the obtained values are returned by the arrays polpdf(@xmath473:3 ) and struct(3 ) .",
    "the available polarized parton distribution functions and the structure functions are listed in table [ mm : tab1 ] .",
    "it should be noted that the returned values are the distributions and the structure functions multiplied by @xmath4 .",
    ".available distributions and structure functions .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     the distribution values are obtained by interpolating the grid data which are provided as data statements in the subroutine .",
    "the number of the grid points is 23 for the variable @xmath10 and 68 for the variable @xmath4 .",
    "because the @xmath10 dependence of the distributions is almost linear function of @xmath48 , we simply use the linear interpolation of @xmath49 for the variable @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath50 is in the range @xmath51 , the distributions at @xmath52 are approximated by    @xmath53    on the other hand , the @xmath4 dependence of the distributions is rather complicated .",
    "therefore , we use the cubic spline interpolation for the variable @xmath4 . if @xmath54 is in the range @xmath55 , the distributions at @xmath56 are approximated by    @xmath57    here , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the spline coefficients which can be calculated by the grid data . by using these interpolation methods and the grid data , the aacpdf returns the values of the polarized parton distribution functions and the structure functions @xmath8 at the specified @xmath10 and @xmath4 point .",
    "we verified that the distributions obtained by the library reproduce well the results in ref.@xcite .",
    "aac library can be downloaded from our web page @xcite .",
    "the subroutine aacpdf is in the file",
    " aac.f \" .",
    "this file also includes the subroutine spline and the function iserch which are used in the aacpdf .",
    "the polarized parton distribution functions have been determined by @xmath1 fitting to @xmath2 experimental data . as a result",
    ", we found that the nlo @xmath1 is significantly smaller than the lo one .",
    "it implies that the nlo analysis is important . in the nlo analysis ,",
    "the obtained @xmath3 is rather smaller than the usually quoted values , and the differences come from the small-@xmath4 behavior of @xmath34 . in order to fix @xmath3 precisely , the small-@xmath4 measurements are required .",
    "we propose three sets of aac distributions , lo , nlo-1 ( @xmath35 : free ) , and nlo-2 ( @xmath35 = 1.0 fixed ) . the fortran library is provided for calculating the aac distributions numerically .",
