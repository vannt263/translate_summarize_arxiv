    "the degree of understanding of quantum correlations ( qc ) underlies our current picture of nature @xcite .",
    "it has been recently found that there exist important manifestations of the quantumness of correlations in composite systems that are different from those of entanglement - origin ( eo ) and that may be relevant in quantum information technologies @xcite .",
    "the quantifier of these non - eo correlations is called the quantum discord ( qd ) @xmath1 and is based , for a bipartite system , on shannon s mutual information .",
    "we are thus speaking of an information - theoretic ( it ) tool .",
    "for pure states qd does not add any qcs , but that is not the case for mixed states .",
    "the @xmath6concept , advanced in the pioneer paper by ollivier and zurek @xcite , quantifies : i ) the minimum change in the state of the system and ii ) the information on one of its parts induced by a measurement of the other one .",
    "if the state has only classical correlations , @xmath1 vanishes , which implies that the quantum discord concept somehow quantifies the `` correlational - quantumness '' .",
    "it has been evaluated for several families of states both in its original form and in variously altered versions and generalizations .",
    "a particularly compelling instance expresses the qd - notion in terms of conditional density operators @xcite .",
    "interesting operational qd - interpretations have also been advanced @xcite .",
    "evaluating qd requires a rather involved optimization procedure , analytical expressions being known in just a few instances @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is built up as an entropic difference , the difference between a quantum entropic measure and its classical counterpart , which is derived from local measurements on one or both of the participant subsystems .",
    "its amount is a new feature @xmath7 of the quantum state @xmath8 , which in turn induces a @xmath6amount `` ordering '' for states of the form @xmath9 , for instance .",
    "now , it - tools come in many distinct varieties .",
    "given the immense body of literature that has been generated in the past two decades concerning physically motivated statistical formalisms based on generalizations of shannon s information measure ( see @xcite and references therein ) , it seems both natural and necessary to tackle the qd issues from this generalized angle , in the hope of gaining interesting insights , and , in particular , so as to establish the invariance or not of the discord - induced order under a change of the prevailing statistics , from shannon s to its many rivals .    to show that this is indeed",
    "a fruitful endeavor is the aim of the present paper , in which a generalization of the quantum discord _ concept _",
    ", in the context of generalized statistics , will be advanced and the `` ordering - question '' answered . in section 2",
    "we introduce our conceptual qd - extension , discussing its main properties in sect .",
    "next we present some results for general bipartite states , focusing attention on analytical results .",
    "we also perform numerical simulations for random bipartite states ( sect .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "tsallis power - law @xmath11-entropy was introduced in @xcite as an extension of the shannon entropy as follows @xcite    @xmath12    where the @xmath11-logarithm is defined by @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the probability distribution of the pertinent random variable @xmath15 , and @xmath11 is any nonnegative real number .",
    "tsallis s entropy converges to shannon s in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 plays a fundamental role in recent developments of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the generalization has indeed received a lot of attention in the last years , with about 2000 papers containing interesting results and useful applications , many of them in the complex systems area @xcite but also in connection with a variegated family of quantum mechanical settings ( see , for example @xcite ) . in what follows",
    "we retrace the developments of ref .",
    "@xcite in a tsallis , @xmath18context .",
    "thus , just by setting @xmath19 we recover the ollivier - zurek quantities .",
    "we begin then with the mutual information , defined as    @xmath20    and the following chain rule holds @xcite :    @xmath21    where the conditional entropy reads @xmath22 the chain rule gives the relation between a conditional entropy and a joint entropy . using this relation we can define another , classically equivalent , expression for the mutual information    @xmath23    the @xmath24 difference is of the essence for ollivier - zureck goals , after expressing the two quantifiers in quantal fashion .",
    "let us then do the same with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath25 can be easily generalized defining appropriate density matrices for the quantum systems , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , and applying then the @xmath11-generalization of von neumann s entropy @xmath30 .",
    "one has    @xmath31    to generalize the @xmath32expression , following @xcite , we focus on a perfect measurements of @xmath28 defined by a set of projectors @xmath33 such that @xmath34 . accordingly ,    @xmath35    where    @xmath36    with the state of @xmath8 given , once the measurement is performed , by    @xmath37    and @xmath38 .    the two classical expressions for the standard mutual information we have presented above are identical , but this is not necessarily so in the quantum case actually , the quantum discord is defined as the _ minimum _ possible difference between the two possibilities , given by an _",
    "optimum _ set of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "thus , we are to be concerned here with what happens to the expressions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "introduce the quantity    @xmath39    we define now our quantum q - discord as the difference    @xmath40    this quantum q - discord is the minimum of the difference between eq .",
    "( [ imutua ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ jmutua ] ) .",
    "we normalize this measure via a trivial re - scaling in order to compare , in an adequate way , different quantities :    @xmath41    for similar reasons , @xmath42 denotes the logarithm of base 2 . in",
    "what follows @xmath43 .",
    "note that @xmath44 .",
    "we see that @xmath45 for @xmath46 , and this might be related to the concavity of the @xmath11-conditional entropy @xmath47 with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , @xmath48 becomes negative if @xmath11 grows from @xmath49 , negativity increasing with @xmath11 .",
    "quite convenient is the particular case @xmath50 , since it requires only to compute the traces of @xmath51 , and matrix - diagonalization is avoided , making computations more efficient . taking the limit @xmath52 of the normalized measure we obtain    @xmath53    to study the positivity of the q - discord we consider separately two cases : pure states and mixed states .      for pure states , that is @xmath54 ,",
    "the q - discord takes the form @xmath55 and the quantum q - discord coincides with the reduced ( quantum ) tsallis entropy .",
    "we can easily verify this fact by casting @xmath56 in its schmidt decomposition form @xmath57 .",
    "thus , since the q - entropy is positive for all @xmath11 ,    @xmath58      in the case of mixed states our q - discord is positive only for values of @xmath11 in @xmath59 . in order to demonstrate the positivity of the q - discord for mixed arbitrary states we follow @xcite and consider the proposition : @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "now , @xmath62 is block diagonal and as in the @xmath19 case , doing a block by block analysis the proposition can be proved .",
    "now we need to verify the inequality :    @xmath63    by recourse of the previous preposition we can establish the following relation for any measurement @xmath33    @xmath64    and by the ( conjectured ) concavity ( see below ) of the conditional entropy ( @xmath65 ) with respect to @xmath66 for @xmath46 we are led to    @xmath67      the set of states in an @xmath69-dimensional hilbert space can be regarded as a product - space of the form @xcite ,    @xmath70 where @xmath71 stands for the family of all complete sets of ortho - normal projectors @xmath72 ( @xmath73 the identity matrix ) , and @xmath74 is the convex set of all real @xmath68tuples of the form @xmath75 any state in @xmath76 takes the form @xmath77 in order to explore @xmath78 we introduce an appropriate measure @xmath79 on this space .",
    "such a measure is required to compute volumes within @xmath78 , as well as to determine what is to be understood by a uniform distribution of states on @xmath80 .",
