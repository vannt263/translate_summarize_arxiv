    "when a gas of neutral atoms is excited into weakly bound rydberg states , exceptionally large interactions due to enhanced polarizability occur .",
    "attractive forces accelerate atoms towards each other and energy is exchanged resonantly in binary collisions  a process studied in great detail during the past forty years @xcite .",
    "more recently , laser cooling and trapping techniques have permitted to suspend atomic motion to the extent where energy transfer dynamics is dominated not by collisions of atom pairs , but rather by many - body processes @xcite .",
    "when motional degrees of freedom are frozen out , dipolar interactions can cause coherent redistribution of energy , during which an excitation can delocalize over many atoms and great lengths . in this regime ,",
    "transfer of excitations in the rydberg gas shows undeniable similarities to energy transport in lvy spin glasses @xcite , between nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond @xcite , and in certain molecular aggregates such as , e.g. , lattice - confined polar molecules @xcite and light - harvesting complexes that are employed in photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "an advantage of rydberg atoms and gases is their high degree of experimental controllability @xcite .",
    "in particular , radiative losses are weak , what allows to study the regime of purely coherent excitation transfer  or to introduce , in a controlled way , various sources of noise giving rise to predominantly incoherent transport mechanisms , in different degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "rydberg gases therefore constitute an ideal testbed to study the physics of coherent ( or incoherent ) energy transfer which , due to the combined influence of disorder and coherence , gives rise to an intriguing variety of phenomena ranging from diffusive ( where the excitation , if initially localized at a single atom , eventually spreads over the whole cloud ) to localized transport ( where , even at long times , the excitation remains localized in a certain sub - region of the cloud ) @xcite .",
    "while disorder and interaction - induced transport phenomena represent a long - standing and central theme of condensed matter theory @xcite , mesoscopic physics @xcite , light matter interaction @xcite and , more recently , quantum simulation @xcite , one can argue that cold rydberg gases offer the specific advantage to address rather subtle issues of quantum transport theory in disordered systems , which hitherto could not be addressed . in our present contribution",
    ", we will focus on the tunability of the spectral structure of these experimental objects .",
    "since the seminal works of @xcite and @xcite , it has been known that a metal - insulator phase transition exists in three - dimensional lattices with random site energies and short - range interactions @xcite : if , above a certain strength of disorder , the couplings to sites at large distances @xmath1 decay faster than @xmath2 , then all states are exponentially localized , and diffusive transport does not occur  the probability to find an excitation at its site of origin is finite for _ all _ times .",
    "anderson s result , however , does not apply to the case of dipolar interactions as they occur in a rydberg gas , where all atoms ( and not only nearest neighbors ) interact with each other by forces falling off like @xmath2 . previous studies relying on approximate methods like the self - consistent theory of localization @xcite and a random matrix approach ( implying the neglect of correlations between hamiltonian matrix elements ) @xcite indicate the absence of any exponentially localized states in the spectrum .",
    "notwithstanding , whilst the system does not exhibit strict anderson localization , excitation transport may still appear to be spatially localized on the time scale of observation @xcite .",
    "such transient localization can occur due to the existence of algebraically localized ( confluence ) states @xcite giving rise to slow sub - diffusive transport where the excitation continues to spread towards more distant atoms with increasing time , but slower than in case of diffusion . although algebraic localization has been suggested for @xmath3 with @xmath4 , cf .",
    ", the question whether it also occurs for the borderline case @xmath2 is , to our knowledge , still open @xcite .",
    "it is one aim of our work to resolve this question by means of numerically exact simulations of energy transfer in a large frozen rydberg gas cloud . as a first step ,",
    "the present article analyzes the _ spectrum _ of single excitations in the cloud . to give a definite answer to the localization problem ,",
    "also the corresponding eigenstates must be considered , which is the subject of future work based on the results of this article .",
    "note that , due to the recent progress on direct observation techniques of excitation energy transfer @xcite , there is a significant incentive to explicitly study it , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of the hamiltonian eigenvalue spectrum ( while not easily accessible in such experiments ) is of interest on its own : as discussed below , the spectrum itself already carries already information on the spatial extent of eigenfunctions and , therefore , qualitatively also the nature of excitation energy transfer .",
    "furthermore , spectral statistics are interesting from a fundamental theoretical point of view , since they can be compared to universal fluctuation properties of random matrix spectra @xcite .",
    "the assessment of the spectral statistics can be regarded as the first milestone to a complete physical picture of any complex system .",
    "given the computational resources , a feasible and exact approach to the description of large disordered systems is the numerical diagonalization of an exhaustive number of disorder realizations of the hamiltonian .",
    "based on this method , we present results for the spectral density and for the nearest - neighbor level spacing distribution in different regions of energy .",
    "we indeed find evidence for a localization transition that is seeded by rare , yet important occurrences of strongly coupled pairs of nearby rydberg atoms .",
    "significantly , localization is shown to be controllable : it depends on the strength of the dipole blockade @xcite that has been proposed as a means to perform quantum gate operations with rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "it can also be used to influence the distribution of pair distances ( e.g. , to tune the minimal distance between rydberg atoms ) @xcite as well as to create collective rydberg excitations that spread over many atoms @xcite . in the blockaded regime",
    ", the collective ground state of the system has been predicted to transition from a disordered into an ordered , crystalline phase @xcite which , as shown here , is accompanied by a reduction and eventual elimination of localization .",
    "we subsequently compare the numerically obtained statistics to results from random matrix theory @xcite and certain self - consistent perturbative techniques @xcite .",
    "random matrix theory is widely used in studies of complex systems @xcite , where it replaces a complicated hamiltonian model that is not fully known or not solvable .",
    "we specifically discuss the applicability of universal gaussian orthogonal @xcite and @xmath5-stable random matrix ensembles @xcite , the latter of which have been studied in the field of lvy spin glasses @xcite .",
    "random matrix theory is typically restricted to matrices with independent and identically distributed entries @xcite , the gaussian and @xmath5-stable ensembles being no exception .",
    "spectral signatures of correlations between hamiltonian matrix elements that are identified in our numerical reference can thus not be reproduced .",
    "a possible remedy is provided by diagrammatic perturbation series , since these account for correlations .",
    "their drawback is , however , that they are limited by a quickly increasing complexity of higher order corrections .",
    "yet , we assess and confirm their capability by solving analytical expressions for the spectral density derived from approximations to the self - consistent ensemble - averaged matsubara - toyozawa locator expansion @xcite .    correspondingly , this document is organized as follows : sec .",

    "it is a well - known fact @xcite that atoms in or close to their ground state constitute an inert , inactive background to resonant transfer of energy in an ultra - cold rydberg gas .",
    "since this study is dedicated solely to the latter , only the fraction @xmath6 of the atomic vapor that is excited to rydberg states will be described . in particular , for each rydberg atom , we consider a reduced level manifold of a lower and an upper rydberg state , @xmath7[1/2][1/2]$ ] and @xmath8[3/2][3/2]$ ] , with @xmath9 being the principal quantum number , the letters @xmath10 and @xmath11 referring to angular momentum , and the half integers in the subset denoting fine structure .",

    "[ app : validity_2lvl_approx ] , we explain how and to what extent that can be achieved . for rubidium and @xmath14 , the lifetime of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 rydberg states is about or less than @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "according to the `` frozen rydberg gas '' hypothesis @xcite , for temperatures less than @xmath16 , the thermal motion of the atoms center of mass coordinates is negligible on this timescale .",
    "usually , the excitation volume has an elongated , nearly one - dimensional shape with a gaussian density profile @xmath17 , but also homogeneous rydberg clouds with cigar @xcite , saucer , or spherical shape @xcite are conceivable . in this article , we concentrate on uniform spherical ( true 3d ) gases with nearest neighbors separated by typically @xmath18 ( corresponding to @xmath19 ) .",
    "this distance is large compared to the extent of an electronic wave function ( given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 bohr s radius , for @xmath14 ) , and electron exchange will be neglected .    only non - radiative dipole forces proportional to @xmath22 are taken into account , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant depending on the absolute value of the dipole moment of the electronic transition @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the distance vector connecting two rydberg atoms @xmath27 , @xmath28 with fixed positions @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",

    "long - range forces @xmath40 ( mediated by exchange of transversally polarized photons ) are negligible as long as the largest inter - atomic distance is small compared to the reciprocal of the transition wavenumber @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is approximately @xmath43 for the @xmath10-@xmath11 transition considered here . for the density @xmath19",
    ", we estimate that the near - field approximation for the largest distance ( corresponding to the diameter of the cloud ) is violated if the cloud contains more than @xmath44 rydberg atoms .",
    "the analysis in this article is mostly numerical and focuses , also due to computational limitations , on clouds with @xmath45 or less atoms .",
    "however , at times we also refer to much larger clouds , up to the hypothetical limit @xmath46 .",
    "these results are ( semi- ) analytical and provided as approximation to realistically sized clouds .",
    "since , as mentioned above , relaxation processes ( e.g. due to spontaneous decay ) can be neglected , the numbers of @xmath11 and @xmath10 excitations are conserved . in the following ,",
    "we assume that , at any point in time , exactly one @xmath11 excitation is present in the cloud ( among @xmath47 @xmath10 excitations ) .",
    "we thus arrive at the following hamiltonian : @xmath48 @xmath49 denotes the state for which the @xmath11 excitation is localized at atom no .",
    "@xmath27 , while all other rydberg atoms reside in the state @xmath10 .",
    "keep in mind that , due to a lack of order in the cloud , the numbering and labeling of atoms is arbitrary .",

    ", excitations are exchanged the faster , the closer the rydberg atoms are .",
    "this suggests that in a cluster ( or `` cavity '' @xcite ) , i.e. , in a dense agglomeration of two or more atoms , transport occurs much faster than in the more dilute parts of the system . as we discuss now",
    ", this implies that energy transport to and away from the cluster is slower than in the case where the cluster is replaced by a single atom .",
    "the smallest cluster is just a pair of two atoms , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "consider for the moment that the pair @xmath56 shares a distance much smaller than its separation from the surrounding neighbor atoms .",
    "then , also depending on the value of @xmath57 , the pair s coupling energy @xmath58 may exceed the interaction strengths to all other atoms by orders of magnitude .",
    "in that case , the neighbors presence plays the role of an insignificant perturbation .",
    "the pair - localized states @xmath59 are almost exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "these states have approximate eigenenergies @xmath60 any excitation starting from either atom is strongly confined .",
    "likewise , excitations from elsewhere are strongly inhibited from reaching the pair .",
    "henceforth we refer to this effect as `` pair localization '' .",
    "transport is only notably affected by the pair localization effect if strongly interacting pairs of nearby rydberg atoms appear sufficiently frequently . to analyze the likelihood of their occurrence",
    ", one has to consider that the randomness in the placement of atoms is passed on deterministically to the hamiltonian , the matrix elements @xmath61 of which thus become random variables themselves .",
    "their statistical properties can be derived on the basis of the constraints we impose on the random picking of atomic positions .    for now , let us set @xmath27 and @xmath28 fixed with @xmath62 . then @xmath33 and @xmath63 are independent random variables with known and fairly simple distributions . the statistical distribution of @xmath58 , in the following referred to as the probability density function @xmath64 ,",
    "is then obtained as the distribution of the product @xmath65 .",
    "this straight - forward yet cumbersome calculation is carried out in app .",

    "the same asymptotics is found for other angular dependencies than , e.g. , a simplified isotropic model with constant @xmath33 or a cloud for which the atomic dipole moments are oriented in all directions fully randomly .",
    "the fact that @xmath64 decays algebraically according to eq .",
    "implies that the occurrence of very large hamiltonian matrix elements is much more likely than in any gaussian distribution . in the following , specifically in secs .",
    "[ sec : spectrum : density_of_states ] and [ sec : spectrum : level_spacing_statistics ] , we discuss that localized pairs entail distinctive spectral signatures and are crucial in understanding energy transport in rydberg clouds . in previous work , it has already been acknowledged that spectral and eigenstate statistics of related physical systems ( random dipolar interactions in three dimensions ) are affected by pairs @xcite .",
    "however , the details and the extent of their influence are hitherto still largely unknown .",
    "the random variables @xmath75 are not independent .",
    "consider three tuples of atoms ; @xmath56 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding matrix elements feature correlations that are rooted in basic properties of euclidean space .",
    "specifically , the triangle inequality @xmath78 applies to all inter - atomic distances , and correlations thus exist between all matrix elements .",
    "that is , the joint probability density function of all matrix elements , @xmath79 , does not factor into a product of marginal probability density functions , especially not into the product of single variable densities , @xmath80 ( in which case the @xmath58 are completely independent  a frequent assumption in random matrix theory ) .",
    "the comparison of spectra between models incorporating correlations and those omitting them will be an important part of the upcoming discussion .",
    "so far , the model allows the atoms to become arbitrarily close , which is expressed in the algebraic scaling of @xmath64 , eq .   above . at first glance",
    ", there is no problem in treating the rydberg atoms as point - sized objects , as long as the randomized inter - atomic distances are sufficiently unlikely to fall below the extent of the respective electronic rydberg wave - functions .",
    "however , that must be reconsidered in light of the existence of the dipole blockade effect @xcite .    the dipole blockade results from van der waals ( i.e. higher order dipolar ) coupling between a rydberg and a neighboring atom in ( or close to ) its ground state .",
    "in principle , it prevents the laser excitation of the latter into a rydberg state if the laser s spectral width is small relative to the energy shift induced by the van der waals coupling @xcite .",
    "the reality is more convoluted than that , however @xcite ; in an equally likely scenario , the neighbor and the rydberg atom may have exchanged places or roles .",
    "since these scenarios are physically indistinguishable , the single rydberg excitation is eventually shared coherently by all involved atoms .",
    "as the excitation process is both collective and localized , these blockaded excitations have been referred to has `` rydberg super - atoms '' @xcite .    for our purposes ,",
    "it is sufficient to treat a super - atom like a single rydberg atom , with the exception that it is equipped with an approximately spherical exclusion volume with radius @xmath81 @xcite , in which no other rydberg atom is allowed to exist . in app .",
    "[ app : limitations_superatoms ] , we discuss some of the limitations of the super - atom and blockade sphere pictures . due to the nature of the van der waals coupling , the effect is externally tunable @xcite and distance dependent , being the stronger the closer the atoms are . in a cloud with many rydberg excitations , it suppresses the relative likelihood of occurrence of short distances between rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "we therefore introduce the smallest allowed distance , @xmath81 , as an additional parameter to our model . in other words",
    ", we sample the @xmath6 atomic positions uniformly within a @xmath82-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath83{3 n / { \\mathopen{}\\mathclose\\bgroup\\originalleft}(4 \\pi{\\aftergroup\\egroup\\originalright})}$ ] and only keep those configurations in which all inter - atomic distances are larger than the blockade radius @xmath81 .",
    "this has two major consequences : first , it is well known that energy transport in ordered systems is fundamentally different from transport in disordered ensembles @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study large blockade radii @xmath81 as these enforce short - range order .",
    "we incorporate random close packing @xcite of equisized and non - overlapping hard spheres that , on a phenomenological level , reproduces the recently discovered self - organization of rydberg super - atoms into crystalline structures @xcite .",
    "second , the abundance of tightly bound pairs of atoms , as discussed in the previous sections , is conditioned on the power law asymptotics of @xmath64 . for non - vanishing @xmath81 ,",
    "this asymptotics is truncated inasmuch as , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) , the interaction @xmath58 is bounded , @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "this enables a better analysis of effects due to pair localization , since their strength becomes controllable by changing the blockade radius @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present numerical results for the spectrum of the single - excitation rydberg gas hamiltonian introduced above .",
    "we consider , first , the spectral density ( averaged over a large number of realizations)which we show to exhibit a universal power law ( for @xmath86 ) in the tails of the spectrum and a characteristic asymmetry in the center ( sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum : density_of_states])and second , spectral correlations as described by the nearest neighbor level spacing statistics ( sec .",

    "[ sec : spectrum : matrix_correlations ] , we analyze the influence of correlations between different matrix elements . in particular , we show that these correlations are responsible for the asymmetry in the spectrum and that they shift the transition from poisson to wigner - dyson statistics towards smaller energies .",
    "finally , the impact of the dipole blockade radius @xmath81 is investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum : dipole_blockade ] and shown to modify mainly the tails of the spectrum .      in this section",
    ", we are concerned with the likelihood of certain eigenenergies in our system and how these statistics change with the system s size , @xmath6 .",
    "to this end , we study the density of states ( spectral density , dos ) that is defined as @xmath87 @xmath88 is the ensemble averaged probability to find an eigenvalue @xmath53 of @xmath51 in the interval @xmath89 $ ] .    fig .",
    "[ fig : flambda_rydberg_sizecomp ] displays histograms obtained by direct numerical diagonalization of many realizations of @xmath51 in the absence of the dipole blockade effect ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "these results display the following two characteristic features :    * first , as can be seen in the insets of the figure , the tails of the spectral density obey the same inverse power law for all @xmath6 , @xmath90 note , however , that ( since the two - level approximation fails for very short atomic distances , cf . app .  [ app : validity_2lvl_approx ] ) @xmath91 for @xmath92 is , strictly speaking , not physical .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath93 are same as of the probability density @xmath64 of any matrix element of @xmath51 ( see eq .   and the discussion on page above ) .",
    "this suggests a simple mapping between large matrix elements and extreme eigenvalues , like it was already established in form of eq .   for the eigenvalues @xmath94 of pair - localized eigenstates .",
    "in other words , only pair - localized states populate the wings of the spectrum .",
    "this conclusion is supported by other studies @xcite , in which the close connection between binary interactions with algebraic scaling , rare but extremely strong couplings , extremely large eigenvalues , and heavy - tailed spectral densities has been recognized . *",
    "second , significant differences between the densities of states for different @xmath6 are found at the spectrum s center , where small systems develop a sharp peak around @xmath95 , and large systems a much more flattened maximum with increased skewness towards positive energies .",
    "this skewness and its origin are the subject of the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectrum : matrix_correlations ] .    as noted above ,",
    "it has been observed in previous studies that hamiltonians with power - law interactions can have heavy - tailed eigenenergy distributions with infinite variance . in the following , we    1 .",
    "verify for the rydberg hamiltonian that this phenomenon corresponds to pairs of eigenstates localized on closely separated , strongly coupled atom pairs ( see sec .",

    "our attention was devoted to the spectral structure of the disordered many - body hamiltonian .",
    "we conducted a numerical survey on the eigenvalue statistics of clouds with a large number of atoms @xmath6 , compared it to results of established random matrix theories , and ultimately supplemented it with various analytical treatments for the asymptotic limit @xmath46 .",

    "the results of our study are relevant equally for the fields of rydberg physics as well as theoretical statistical physics .",
    "the distribution of couplings between unblockaded rydberg atoms has an algebraically decaying tail with diverging second moment .",
    "we found that this leads to a number of interesting effects .",
    "significantly , although close atomic proximity is rare , it is yet a statistically important event .",
    "a diverging coupling strength leads to pair localization , a phenomenon that hinders excitations strongly to visit or leave a pair of closely separated atoms . recognizing pair localization is instrumental in understanding excitonic energy transport in frozen rydberg clouds .",
    "signatures of the effect are visible in the spectral statistics : the spectral density is decaying algebraically and the nearest - neighbor level spacings obey poissonian statistics in the wings of the spectrum . towards the spectrum s center ,",
    "the spacings undergo a transition to universal wigner - dyson statistics , indicating the presence of a mobility edge , i.e. a crossover to a region of dominance of delocalized eigenstates .",
    "interestingly , the dipole blockade effect can be leveraged to tune the effective size of the rydberg atoms .",
    "this opens up the possibility to control the short - range order in the cloud over a wide range , which is compelling for at least two reasons : first , it is well - known that spectral and transport properties can be very different in ordered and disordered systems .",
    "rydberg gases are hence ideal testbeds for theories of transport in disordered systems with dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "second , a strong dipole blockade inhibits short distances .",
    "the degree of pair localization can thus be gradually reduced and its effect on transport be isolated .    in the strong blockade regime , spectral statistics are reminiscent of those of the universal gaussian random matrix ensemble , whereas , for weak blockade , there is significant agreement with the statistical properties of the @xmath0-stable random matrix ensemble .",
    "this is remarkable given that both ensembles regard matrix elements as uncorrelated , whereas the elements of the euclidean many - body rydberg hamiltonian of our model are correlated .",
    "the comparison therefore allowed us to demonstrate that correlations lead both to asymmetry of the spectral density and to a considerable shift of the mobility edges to lower absolute energies .",
    "importantly , the latter indicates clearly that the euclidean correlations have a localizing effect on transport .",
    "we also focused on self - consistent perturbative methods and showed that with these it is possible to reproduce characteristic features of the spectral density , not only for vanishing dipole blockade , but also in the strong blockade regime .",
    "in particular , we were able to describe the effects of pair localization at the spectrum s edges and the skewness introduced by euclidean correlations at the center of the spectrum .",
    "we discussed the compatibility of different diagrammatic approaches and calculated solutions to both the low and the high concentration approximation to the locator expansion .",
    "we found that both approximations have their respective range of validity : the low concentration approximation performs especially well in the weak blockade regime , whereas the high concentration approximation delivers promising results only for strong blockade . both methods proved to be valuable for addressing spectral problems involving ensembles of large disordered hamiltonians with long - range dipolar interactions .    in future work , the statistical properties of the excitation migration and the eigenstates ( associated to the eigenvalues analyzed in this article ) remain to be investigated .",
    "this will allow us to characterize how exactly excitation energy transport in ultra - cold rydberg gases is suppressed by effects like pair localization discussed in this article .",
    "the results presented here suggest that the suppression of transport is inversely correlated with the strength of the rydberg blockade .",
    "qualitatively , we expect a smooth transition between sub - diffusive and diffuse transport upon varying of the rydberg blockade radius .",

    "<S> the spectral structure underlying excitonic energy transfer in ultra - cold rydberg gases is studied numerically , in the framework of random matrix theory , and via self - consistent diagrammatic techniques . </S>",
    "<S> rydberg gases are made up of randomly distributed , highly polarizable atoms that interact via strong dipolar forces . </S>",
    "<S> dynamics in such a system is fundamentally different from cases in which the interactions are of short range , and is ultimately determined by the spectral and eigenvector structure . in the energy levels spacing statistics , we find evidence for a critical energy that separates delocalized eigenstates from states that are localized at pairs or clusters of atoms separated by less than the typical nearest - neighbor distance . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the dipole blockade effect in rydberg gases can be leveraged to manipulate this transition across a wide range : as the blockade radius increases , the relative weight of localized states is reduced . at the same time , the spectral statistics  in particular , the density of states and the nearest neighbor level spacing statistics  exhibits a transition from approximately a @xmath0-stable lvy to a gaussian orthogonal ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from random matrix statistics are shown to stem from correlations between inter - atomic interaction strengths that lead to an asymmetry of the spectral density and profoundly affect localization properties . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss approximations to the self - consistent matsubara - toyozawa locator expansion that incorporate these effects . </S>"
