    "most stars form in protoclusters in dense molecular clumps ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the energy and momentum injected by young stars then removes the remaining interstellar material ( ism ) , thus ending further star formation and reducing the gravitational binding energy of the protoclusters .",
    "this feedback limits the efficiency of star formation ",
    "the ratio of final stellar mass to initial interstellar mass  to only @xmath0 , and leaves many protoclusters unbound , with their constituent stars free to disperse .",
    "even those protoclusters that survive will lose some stars by ism removal and subsequent processes .",
    "two of the best probes of these formation and disruption processes are the mass functions of molecular clouds and young star clusters , defined as the number of objects per unit mass , @xmath1 . for molecular clouds ,",
    "the best - studied galaxies are the milky way and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , while for star clusters , they are the antennae and the lmc . in these and other cases , the observed mass functions can be represented by power laws , @xmath2 , from @xmath3 or below to @xmath4 or above .",
    "giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) identified in co surveys have @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this exponent is also found for massive self - gravitating clumps within gmcs , the formation sites of star clusters , whether they are identified by co emission @xcite or higher - density tracers such as c@xmath6o , @xmath7co , and thermal dust emission @xcite .",
    "young star clusters have @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the similar exponents for clouds and clusters indicate that the efficiency of star formation and probability of disruption are at most weak functions of mass .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that @xmath9 is the same for @xmath10 yr - old clusters as it is for @xmath11 yr - old clusters @xcite .",
    "these empirical results may at first seem puzzling .",
    "low - mass protoclusters have lower binding energy per unit mass and should therefore be easier to disrupt than high - mass protoclusters . indeed , several authors have proposed that feedback would cause a bend in the mass function of young clusters at @xmath12 , motivated in part by the well - known turnover in the mass function of old globular clusters @xcite . for young clusters , such a feature",
    "is not observed ( as noted above ) , while for globular clusters , it arises from almost any initial conditions as a consequence of stellar escape driven by two - body relaxation over @xmath13  yr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , we are left with an important question : what are the physical reasons for the observed similarity of the mass functions of molecular clouds and young star clusters ?",
    "the goal of this letter is to answer this question . in section  [ energymomentum ]",
    ", we derive some general relations between the mass functions of clouds and clusters . in section  [ sec :",
    "efficiency ] , we review a variety of specific feedback processes and estimate the star formation efficiency for radiation pressure , the dominant process in massive , compact protoclusters . we summarize in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the radiative losses inside protoclusters determine how much of the energy input by stellar feedback is available for ism removal .",
    "this in turn depends on the cloud structure and the specific feedback mechanisms involved , but two limiting regimes bracket all realistic situations : energy - driven , with no radiative losses , and momentum - driven , with maximum radiative losses .",
    "we estimate the mass of stars @xmath14 and the corresponding efficiency of star formation , @xmath15 , needed to remove the ism from protoclusters in these regimes as follows .",
    "we characterize a protocluster by its mass @xmath16 , half - mass radius @xmath17 , mean surface density @xmath18 , velocity dispersion @xmath19 ( including the orbital motions of the stars and the turbulent and thermal motions of the interstellar particles ) , rms escape velocity @xmath20 , and crossing time @xmath21 . for simplicity , we neglect rotation , magnetic support , and external pressure ( but see section 3 )",
    ". then the properties of a protocluster are related by @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath25 .",
    "we also assume that the sizes and masses of protoclusters are correlated , with a power - law trend , @xmath26 .    in figure [ msplot ] ,",
    "we plot @xmath18 and @xmath17 against @xmath16 for star - forming molecular clumps in the milky way , based on measurements of cs , c@xmath27o , and 1.2 mm dust emission in three independent surveys @xcite .",
    "these clumps were selected for their star - formation activity ( water masers , iras colors ) , not their surface density . evidently , there is a strong correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath16 , and almost none between @xmath18 and @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "the typical surface density is close to the value @xmath29  g  @xmath30 expected from theory @xcite .",
    "g  @xmath30 .",
    "] we assume that the milky way relations also hold in other galaxies and extend up to @xmath31 , although it is conceivable that they break down above @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite assume that @xmath17 is not correlated with @xmath16 ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) , based on observations of gas - free clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , since ism removal necessarily occurs during the earlier , gas - dominated phase , @xmath28 seems more appropriate in the present context .",
    "as we show here , @xmath28 is also needed to reconcile the observed mass functions of molecular clouds and star clusters .",
    "the rates of energy and momentum input are proportional to the stellar mass : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that the timescale for ism removal is a few crossing times : @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "thus , the total energy and momentum input are @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these reach the critical values needed to remove the ism , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , for    @xmath41    for @xmath42 , the efficiency has little or no dependence on mass : @xmath43 in the energy - driven regime , @xmath44 in the momentum - driven regime . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the variation is much stronger : @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "these relations are valid for @xmath48 .    any dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath16 will cause the mass functions of star clusters @xmath50 and molecular clouds @xmath51 to have different shapes . for the moment ,",
    "we confine our attention to clusters young enough to be easily recognizable even if they are unbound and dispersing .",
    "this limit is @xmath52  yr for extragalactic clusters such as those in the antennae @xcite . in this case , the mass functions of the clusters and clouds are related by @xmath53 ( with a coefficient greater than unity if several clusters form within each cloud ) . for @xmath2 and @xmath54 ,",
    "we have @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "equations ( [ effic : energy ] ) and ( [ effic : momentum ] ) then imply    @xmath57    these expressions give @xmath58 for @xmath59 and 1/2 , respectively .",
    "thus , the similarity of the mass functions of clusters and clouds ( @xmath60 ) _ requires _ that the latter have approximately constant mean surface density ( @xmath61 ) , no matter what type of feedback is involved .    before proceeding",
    ", we make a small correction . for clouds , the observed mass function @xmath62 represents the true mass function at formation @xmath51 ( i.e. , the birthrate ) weighted by the lifetime : @xmath63 . we assume , as before , that lifetime is proportional to crossing time : @xmath64",
    ". then the exponents of the true and observed mass functions are related by @xmath65 . inserting this into equations ( [ beta1e ] ) and ( [ beta1p ] ) ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath66    we now evaluate equations ( [ betastar : energy ] ) and ( [ betastar : momentum ] ) with @xmath67 , the observed exponent of the mass function of molecular clouds @xcite . for constant mean surface density ( @xmath68 ) , we find @xmath69 in the energy - driven regime and @xmath70 in the momentum - driven regime .",
    "these predictions agree nicely with the observed exponents of the mass functions of young star clusters , @xmath71 ( with typical uncertainty @xmath72 ) .",
    "our model is clearly idealized , but the scalings , and thus the agreement between the predicted and observed @xmath73 , should be robust . for constant size ( @xmath33 ) , however , we find @xmath74 in both the energy - driven and momentum - driven regimes , in definite conflict with observations .",
    "the mass function of star clusters older than @xmath52  yr depends on the proportion that remain gravitationally bound .",
    "this in turn depends on the efficiency of star formation @xmath49 and the timescale for ism removal @xmath75 relative to the crossing time @xmath21 .",
    "both analytical arguments and @xmath76-body simulations indicate that young clusters lose most of their stars for @xmath77 and @xmath78 but retain most of them for @xmath79 or @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath49 and @xmath81 are , on average , independent of @xmath16 , as they are for protoclusters with constant mean surface density ( @xmath68 ) and momentum - driven feedback , ism removal will not alter the shape of the mass function ( although its amplitude will decline ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observed exponents @xmath71 for clusters both younger and older than @xmath82  yr in the antennae and lmc @xcite .    in all other cases ,",
    "@xmath49 increases with @xmath16 , and a higher proportion of low - mass clusters is disrupted , causing a flattening or a bend at @xmath83 in the mass function .",
    "the exact shape depends on @xmath84 , clumpiness within protoclusters , and other uncertain factors .",
    "if the efficiency has a weak dependence on mass , as it does for constant mean surface density ( @xmath68 ) and energy - driven feedback ( @xmath43 ) , the predicted @xmath73 might be marginally consistent with observations over a limited range of masses ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , for constant size ( @xmath33 ) , the variations are so strong ( @xmath46 and @xmath86 ) that we expect major differences between the mass functions of clusters younger and older than @xmath82  yr , in clear contradiction with observations .",
    "our simple analytical model agrees , at least qualitatively , with the numerical calculations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they present results for energy - driven feedback by supernovae in protoclusters with uncorrelated sizes and masses .",
    "in some cases , they find a bend in the mass function of young clusters at @xmath87 , while in others , they find a flattened power law with @xmath88 ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "as we have already noted , these results are expected for @xmath33 , and they are inconsistent with the observed mass functions of young clusters .",
    "ccccc supernovae & energy & too late & @xmath89 myr & @xmath90 + main - sequence winds & either & relatively weak & never & + protostellar outflows & momentum & confined in massive clusters & @xmath91 km s@xmath92 & @xmath93 + photoionized gas & momentum & crushed by @xmath94 & @xmath95 & @xmath96 + radiation pressure & momentum & & equations ( [ efficiency ] ) and ( [ sigma_crit ] ) & @xmath97 [ table ]    we now consider five specific feedback mechanisms : supernovae , main - sequence winds , protostellar outflows , photoionized gas , and radiation pressure . for the first four , we review results from the literature .",
    "supernova feedback begins only after the @xmath98 myr lifetimes of massive stars .",
    "unless turbulence within a protocluster is maintained by feedback or external forcing , stars would form rapidly and consume its ism , with @xmath99 in @xmath100 crossing times .",
    "this implies that supernovae can dominate only for @xmath101 myr unless another mechanism somehow keeps @xmath49 small without expelling much ism @xcite .",
    "however , even in this contrived situation , supernovae would play only a secondary role .",
    "main - sequence winds are not effective if their energy is able to leak out of the bubbles they blow @xcite . as a result of this leakage ,",
    "winds simply provide an order - unity enhancement to radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "protostellar outflows can only remove the ism from protoclusters with escape velocities below about 7 kms@xmath92 @xcite .",
    "photoionized gas is important as a feedback mechanism only when its pressure exceeds that of radiation throughout most of an h  ii  region .",
    "this in turn requires that the h  ii  region be larger than the radius @xmath102 at which @xmath103 , a condition harder to satisfy in massive , compact protoclusters @xcite .",
    "we summarize these results in table [ table ] and figure [ fig : ejection ] . as the plot shows , the mechanisms discussed thus far are relatively ineffective in protoclusters with @xmath104 @xmath105 and @xmath106 g @xmath30 .",
    "we therefore turn to radiation pressure .",
    "this would be an energy - driven feedback mechanism if all photons , even those re - radiated by dust grains , remained trapped within a protocluster . however , this is possible only if the protocluster is so dense and smooth that the covering fraction seen from its center exceeds @xmath107 % in the infrared @xcite .",
    "more realistically , the protocluster would be porous enough that photons could escape after only a few interactions with dust grains , and radiation pressure would then be a momentum - driven feedback mechanism .",
    "the following analysis extends that of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we consider an idealized , spherical cloud of mass @xmath16 and outer radius @xmath108 , with an internal density profile @xmath109 ( hence @xmath110 ) .",
    "radiation from young stars near the center of the cloud ionizes the gas and drives the expanding outer shell of this h  ii  region . after a time @xmath111",
    ", the momentum imparted to the shell is @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the stellar luminosity ( assumed constant for simplicity ) , and @xmath114 accounts for assistance from main - sequence winds and incomplete leakage of starlight and wind energy @xcite . neglecting gravity for the moment ,",
    "the velocity and radius of the shell are related by @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "thus , when the shell reaches the cloud surface ( @xmath117 ) , it has swept up all the remaining ism , with mass @xmath118 , and has a velocity given by @xmath119    we specify the condition for ism removal against gravity of the protocluster by @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is a parameter of order unity that accounts for magnetic support and other uncertain factors ( discussed below ) .",
    "the required luminosity , from equation ( 4 ) , is @xmath122 the fundamental scaling @xmath123 arises here in the same way it does for the growth of supermassive black holes and galactic spheroids @xcite .",
    "rewriting equation ( [ l_crit ] ) in terms of @xmath124 and @xmath125 and solving for @xmath49 , we obtain our basic result @xmath126 with @xmath127 the coefficient in the last equation is based on @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( see notes to table [ table ] ) .",
    "regardless of the exact value of @xmath130 , we note that @xmath49 depends on @xmath16 and @xmath108 only through @xmath18 .",
    "thus , when @xmath18 is constant , @xmath49 is independent of @xmath16 , and the mass functions of clusters and clouds have the same exponent ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "figure [ sfeplot ] shows @xmath132 computed from equations ( [ efficiency ] ) and ( [ sigma_crit ] ) . clearly , @xmath49 increases monotonically with @xmath18 from 0 to 1 , reaching @xmath133 for @xmath134 g @xmath30 .",
    "we expect @xmath135  25 .",
    "the escape velocity from the surface of an unmagnetized cloud corresponds to @xmath136 , while the internal velocity dispersion , possibly sufficient for some ism removal , corresponds to @xmath137 .",
    "a shell driven by a constant force requires @xmath138 ( for @xmath139 ; see equation ( a17 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "we consider @xmath140 to be plausible ; certainly a protocluster boils violently and loses mass rapidly using this condition .",
    "our intent here is not to make a detailed comparison between the model and observations . given the simplicity of the former and the uncertainties in the latter , it is gratifying that they agree even roughly with each other .",
    "this letter contains two main results .",
    "the first is the relation between the power - law exponents of the mass functions of molecular clouds and young star clusters , @xmath141 and @xmath73 , in the limiting regimes in which stellar feedback is energy - driven and momentum - driven , equations ( [ betastar : energy ] ) and ( [ betastar : momentum ] ) , which bracket all realistic cases . the predicted @xmath73 depends significantly on the initial size - mass relation of the protoclusters .",
    "we find good agreement between the predicted and observed @xmath73 , especially for momentum - driven feedback , for @xmath142 , the relation indicated by observations of gas - dominated protoclusters . in this case , the star formation efficiency is independent of protocluster mass , ensuring that the fraction of clusters that remain gravitationally bound following ism removal is also independent of mass .",
    "the second main result is an estimate of the star formation efficiency in protoclusters regulated by radiation pressure , equations ( [ efficiency ] ) and ( [ sigma_crit ] ) .",
    "this is likely to be the dominant feedback process in massive protoclusters .",
    "we show that @xmath49 depends on @xmath16 and @xmath17 only through the mean surface density @xmath18 , which in turn guarantees consistency between the observed power - law exponents of the mass functions of molecular clouds and young star clusters according to our general relations . for @xmath143  g  @xmath30 , we estimate @xmath144 , in satisfactory agreement with observations .",
    "we thank bruce elmegreen , chris mckee , dean mclaughlin , norm murray , john scalo , nathan smith , and the referee for helpful comments .",
