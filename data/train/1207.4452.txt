    "the aim of fitness landscape analysis is to understand the properties of a given combinatorial optimization problem in order to design efficient search algorithms .",
    "one of the main feature is related to the number of local optima , to their distribution over the search space and to the shape of their basins of attraction .",
    "for instance , in single - objective optimization , it has been shown that local optima tend to be clustered in a ` central massif ' for numerous combinatorial problems , such as the family of @xmath0-landscapes  @xcite .",
    "a lot of methods are designed to ` escape ' from such local optima . however , very little is known in the frame of multiobjective combinatorial optimization ( moco ) , where one of the most challenging question relies on the identification of the set of pareto optimal solutions .",
    "a pareto local optima ( plo ) @xcite is a solution that is not dominated by any of its neighbors .",
    "the description of plo is one of the first fundamental step towards the description of the structural properties of a moco problem .",
    "surprisingly , up to now , there is a lack of study on the number and on the distribution of plo in moco .",
    "like in single - objective optimization , the plo - related properties clearly have a strong impact on the landscape of the problem , and then on the efficiency of search algorithms .",
    "in particular , local search algorithms are designed in order to take them into account .",
    "for instance ,",
    "the family of pareto local search ( pls )  @xcite iteratively improves a set of solutions with respect to a given neighborhood operator and to the pareto dominance relation .",
    "the aim of pls , like a number of other search algorithms , is to find a set of mutually non - dominated plo .",
    "pls has been proved to terminate on such a set , called a _ pareto local optimum set _",
    "notice that a pareto optimal solution is a plo , and that the whole set of pareto optimal solutions is a pareto local optimum set .",
    "the behavior of multiobjective algorithms clearly depends on the properties related to the plo .",
    "first , a pareto local optimum set is always a subset of the whole set of plo .",
    "second , the dynamics of a pls - like algorithm depends of the number of plo found along the search process .",
    "the probability to improve an approximation set that contains a majority of plo should be smaller than the probability to improve an approximation set with few plo .",
    "there exists a small amount of literature related to fitness landscape for moco .",
    "borges and hansen @xcite study the distribution of local optima , in terms of scalarized functions , for the multiobjective traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) .",
    "another analysis of neighborhood - related properties for biobjective tsp instances of different structures is given in @xcite .",
    "knowles and corne @xcite lead a landscape analysis on the multiobjective quadratic assignment problem with a rough objective correlation .",
    "next , the transposition of standard tools from fitness landscape analysis to moco are discussed by garrett @xcite , and an experimental study is conducted with fitness distance correlation . but this measure requires the true pareto optimal set to be known . in another study , the landscape of a moco problem",
    "is regarded as a neutral landscape , and divided into different fronts with the same dominance rank @xcite .",
    "in such a case , a small search space needs to be enumerated . in previous works on multiobjective @xmath0-landscapes by aguirre and tanaka  @xcite ,",
    "small enumerable fitness landscapes are studied according to the number of fronts , the number of solutions on each front , the probability to pass from one front to another , and the hypervolume of the pareto front .",
    "however , the study of fronts simply  allows to analyze small search spaces , and from the point of view of dominance rank  only .    in this work , our attempt is to analyze the structure of large search space using the central notion of local optimum . for the design of a local search algorithm for moco , the following questions are under study in this paper : ( @xmath1 )  what is the number of plo in the whole search space ? ( @xmath2 )  is the number of plo related to the number of pareto optimal solutions ?",
    "in particular we want to study such properties according to the correlation degree between objective functions . in order to study the problem structure , and in particular the plo",
    ", we use the multiobjective @xmath0-landscapes with objective correlation , _",
    "@xmath3-landscapes _ for short , recently proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the contributions of this work can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we show the co - influence of objective correlation , objective space dimension and epistasis on the number of plo .",
    "next , we propose a method based on the length of a pareto adaptive walk to estimate this number . at",
    "last , we study the number of plo for large - size instances .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : lsmoco ] deals with moco and local search algorithms .",
    "section [ sec : rhomnk ] is devoted to the definition of multiobjective @xmath0-landscapes with objective correlation . in section [ sec : plo ] , we study the number of plo for enumerable instances and we propose a method to estimate it .",
    "moreover , we analyze the correlation between the number of plo and pareto optimal solutions . in section [ sec : large ] , the co - influence of objective space dimension , objective correlation and epistasis is studied for the plo of large - size instances .",
    "the last section concludes the paper .",
    "a multiobjective combinatorial optimization ( moco ) problem can be defined by a set of @xmath4 objective functions @xmath5 , and a ( discrete ) set @xmath6 of feasible solutions in the _ decision space_. let @xmath7 be the set of feasible outcome vectors in the _ objective space_. in a maximization context , a solution @xmath8 is dominated by a solution @xmath9 , denoted by @xmath10 , iff @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 . a solution @xmath9 is said to be _ pareto optimal _ ( or _ efficient _ , _ non - dominated _ ) , if there does not exist any other solution @xmath8 such that @xmath15 dominates @xmath16 .",
    "the set of all pareto optimal solutions is called the _ pareto optimal set _ ( or the _ efficient set _ ) , denoted by @xmath17 , and its mapping in the objective space is called the _ pareto front_. a possible approach in moco is to identify the minimal complete pareto optimal set , _",
    "i.e. _  one solution mapping to each point of the pareto front .",
    "however , the overall goal is often to identify a good pareto set approximation . to this end",
    ", metaheuristics in general , and evolutionary algorithms in particular , have received a growing interest since the late eighties .",
    "multiobjective metaheuristics still constitute an active research area  @xcite .",
    "a _ neighborhood structure _ is a function @xmath18 that assigns a set of solutions @xmath19 to any solution @xmath9 .",
    "the set @xmath20 is called the _ neighborhood _ of @xmath16 , and a solution @xmath21 is called a _ neighbor _ of @xmath16 . in single - objective combinatorial optimization , a fitness landscape can be defined by the triplet @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the fitness function , that can be pictured as the _ height _ of the corresponding solutions .",
    "each peak of the landscape corresponds to a local optimum . in a single - objective maximization context ,",
    "local optimum _ is a solution @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the ability of local search algorithms has been shown to be related to the number of local optima for the problem under study , and to their distribution over the landscapes @xcite .    in moco , given that pareto optimal solutions are to be found , the notion of local optimum has to be defined in terms of pareto optimality .",
    "let us define the concepts of pareto local optimum and of pareto local optimum set",
    ". for more details , refer to @xcite .",
    "a solution @xmath9 is a _ pareto local optimum _ ( plo ) with respect to a neighborhood structure  @xmath27 if there does not exist any neighboring solution @xmath21 such that @xmath28 .",
    "pareto local optimum set _",
    "@xmath29 with respect to a neighborhood structure  @xmath27 is a set of mutually non - dominated solutions such that @xmath30 , there does not exist any solution @xmath31 such that @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "a locally pareto optimal set can not be improved , in terms of pareto optimality , by adding solutions from its neighborhood .",
    "recently , local search algorithms have been successfully applied to moco problems .",
    "such methods seem to take advantage of some properties of the landscape in order to explore the search space in an effective way .",
    "two main classes of local search for moco can be distinguished .",
    "the first ones , known as _ scalar approaches _ , are based on multiple scalarized aggregations of the objective functions .",
    "the second ones , known as _ pareto - based approaches _ , directly or indirectly focus the search on the pareto dominance relation ( or a slight modification of  it ) .",
    "one of them is the pareto local search ( pls ) @xcite .",
    "it combines the use of a neighborhood structure with the management of an archive ( or population ) of mutually non - dominated solutions found so far .",
    "the basic idea is to iteratively improve this archive by exploring the neighborhood of its own content until no  further improvement is possible , _",
    "i.e. _ the archive falls in a pareto local optimum set  @xcite .",
    "in single - objective optimization , the family of @xmath0-landscapes constitutes an interesting model to study the influence of non - linearity on the number of local optima . in this section ,",
    "we present the @xmath3-landscapes proposed in @xcite .",
    "they are based on the @xmath32-landscapes @xcite . in this multiobjective model",
    ", the correlation between objective functions can be precisely tuned by a correlation parameter value .",
    "the family of @xmath0-landscapes @xcite is a problem - independent model used for constructing multimodal landscapes .",
    "@xmath33 refers to the number of ( binary ) genes in the genotype ( _ i.e. _ the string length ) and @xmath34 to the number of genes that influence a particular gene from the string ( the epistatic interactions ) . by increasing the value of @xmath34 from 0 to @xmath35",
    ", @xmath0-landscapes can be gradually tuned from smooth to rugged .",
    "the fitness function ( to be maximized ) of a @xmath0-landscape @xmath36 is defined on binary strings of size @xmath33 .",
    "an ` atom ' with fixed epistasis level is represented by a fitness component @xmath37 associated to each bit @xmath38 .",
    "its value depends on the allele at bit @xmath1 and also on the alleles at @xmath34 other epistatic positions ( @xmath34 must fall between @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the fitness @xmath41 of a solution @xmath42 corresponds to the mean value of its @xmath33 fitness components @xmath43 : [ defnk ] @xmath44 , where @xmath45 . in this work",
    ", we set the @xmath34 bits randomly on the bit string of size @xmath33 .",
    "each fitness component @xmath43 is specified by extension , _",
    "i.e. _ a number @xmath46 from @xmath47 is associated with each element @xmath48 from @xmath49 .",
    "those numbers are uniformly distributed in the range @xmath47 .",
    "more recently , a multiobjective variant of @xmath0-landscapes ( namely @xmath32- landscapes ) @xcite has been defined with a set of @xmath50 fitness functions : @xmath51,\\ f_{nk_{m}}(x ) = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{i=1}^{n } f_{m , i}(x_i , x_{i_{m , 1 } } , \\ldots , x_{i_{m , k_{m}}})\\ ] ] the numbers of epistasis links @xmath52 can theoretically be different for each fitness function .",
    "but in practice , the same epistasis degree @xmath53 for all @xmath54 $ ] is used . each fitness component @xmath55",
    "is specified by extension with the numbers @xmath56 . in the original @xmath32-landscapes @xcite",
    ", these numbers are randomly and independently drawn from @xmath47 . as a consequence ,",
    "it is very unlikely that two different solutions map to the same point in the objective space .      in @xcite",
    ", @xmath57-landscapes have been proposed .",
    "the epistasis structure is identical for all the objectives : @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath53 and @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath60 .",
    "the fitness components are not defined independently .",
    "the numbers @xmath61 follow a multivariate uniform law of dimension  @xmath50 , defined by a correlation matrix @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the @xmath63 s follow a multidimensional law with uniform marginals and the correlations between @xmath64s are defined by the matrix @xmath62 .",
    "so , the four parameters of the family of @xmath57-landscapes are ( @xmath1 )  the number of objective functions @xmath50 , ( @xmath2 )  the length of the bit string @xmath33 , ( @xmath65 )  the number of epistatic links @xmath34 , and ( @xmath66 )  the correlation matrix @xmath62 .    in the @xmath3-landscapes ,",
    "a matrix @xmath67 is considered , with the same correlation between all the objectives : @xmath68 for all @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",
    "however , it is not possible to have the matrix @xmath72 for all @xmath73 between @xmath74 $ ] : @xmath73 must be greater than @xmath75 , see @xcite . to generate random variables with uniform marginals and a specified correlation matrix @xmath62",
    ", we follow the work of hotelling and pabst @xcite .",
    "the construction of @xmath57-landscapes defines correlation between the @xmath63 s but not directly between the objectives . in @xcite , it is proven by algebra that the correlation between objectives is tuned by the matrix @xmath62 : @xmath76 . in @xmath3-landscape ,",
    "the parameter @xmath73 allows to tune very precisely the correlation between all pairs of objectives .",
    "in this section , we first study the number of pareto local optima ( plo ) according to the objective correlation , the number of objectives and the epistasis of @xmath3-landscapes . then",
    ", we analyze its relation with the size of the pareto optimal set . at last ,",
    "we propose an adaptive walk that is able to estimate the number of plo very precisely .",
    "we conduct an empirical study for @xmath77 so that we can enumerate all the plo exhaustively . in order to minimize the influence of the random creation of landscapes",
    ", we considered @xmath78 different and independent instances for each parameter combinations : @xmath73 , @xmath50 , and @xmath34 .",

    "this paper gives a fitness landscape analysis for multiobjective combinatorial optimization based on the local optima of multiobjective @xmath0-landscapes with objective correlation .",
    "we first focused on small - size problems with a study of the number of local optima by complete enumeration .",
    "like in single - objective optimization , the number of local optima increases with the degree of non - linearity of the problem ( epistasis ) . however , the number of objective functions and the objective correlation have a stronger influence .",
    "futhermore , our results show that the cardinality of the pareto optimal set clearly increases with the number of local optima .",
    "we proposed a pareto adaptive walk , associated with a pareto hill - climber , to estimate the number of local optima for a given problem size .",
    "next , for large - size instances , the length of such pareto adaptive walk can give a measure related to the difficulty of a multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "we show that this measure increases exponentially with the problem size .",
    "a problem with a small number of negatively correlated objectives gives the same degree of multi - modality , in terms of pareto dominance , than another problem with a high objective space dimension and a positive correlation .",
    "a similar analysis would allow to better understand the structure of the landscape for other multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "however , an appropriate model to estimate the number of local optima for any problem size still needs to be properly defined . a possible path is to generalize the approach from  @xcite for the multiobjective case . for a more practical purpose , our results",
    "should also be put in relation with the type of the problem under study , in particular on how to compute or estimate the problem - related measures reported in this paper .",
    "moreover , we mainly focused our work on the number of local optima .",
    "the next step is to analyze their distribution by means of a local optima network  @xcite . at last",
    ", we already know that the number and the distribution of local optima have a strong impact on the performance of multiobjective metaheuristics , but it is not yet clear how they exactly affect the search .",
