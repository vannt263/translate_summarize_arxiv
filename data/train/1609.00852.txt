    "this rapid increase of content delivery in the internet has revealed the need for a different networking paradigm .",
    "further , as fig . [ fig : fig1 ] describes , the emerging trend is that the users are just interested in the information ( content ) , and not where it is located or perhaps , even how it is delivered .",
    "this high increase in demand for video content in the internet and the need for new approaches to control this large volume of information have motivated the development of future internet architectures based on named data objects ( ndos ) instead of named hosts @xcite .",
    "such architectural proposals are generally referred to as information centric networking ( icn ) which is a new communication paradigm to increase the efficiency of content delivery and also content availability @xcite-@xcite . in this new concept",

    "they need to cache the frequently requested or popular content locally and store them near the users in the network .",
    "to provide qos , in - network caching is introduced to provide the network components with caching ability",
    ". therefore every node actively contributes in content caching and operates as a potential source of content .",
    "this leads to reduction in network congestion and user access latency and increase in the throughput of the network by locally caching the more popular content @xcite-@xcite .",
    "several works have claimed that web ( file ) requests in internet are distributed according to zipf s law @xcite-@xcite .",
    "zipf s law states that the relative probability of a request for the @xmath0th most popular content is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "however , several other studies have found out that the request distribution generally follows generalized zipf distribution where the request rate for the @xmath0th most popular content is proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a positive value less than unity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "since each icn requires cooperation in caching from other icns to provide a global high performance network , it is necessary to have pricing policies to incentivize all the icns to contribute to the caching process @xcite .",
    "several works have been done to address the problem of the economics of service pricing in current internet and interconnection networks @xcite-@xcite .",
    "using contemporary pricing policies can not incentivize the lower tier isps to cooperate in the future internet architecture @xcite ; hence , we need to have new models to provide them with monetary incentives to collaborate in caching and distributing content when content with different popularities are available in the network .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate joint caching and pricing strategies of the access icn , the transit icn and the content provider based on content popularity .",
    "we study nash strategies for a non - cooperative game among the above entities using a probabilistic model by assuming that access requests generally follow the generalized zipf distribution .",
    "we then use the insights gained to simplify the problem by replacing two caching threshold indices instead of caching parameters for the symmetric case ; where all access icns have the same parameters . in our model ,",

    "they qualitatively showed that without explicit monetary compensation from publishers , the network will fail to deploy the socially optimal number of caches .",
    "few prior works have used game theoretic approaches to solve the problem of caching and pricing in icn . in @xcite",
    "the authors have presented a game theoretic approach using matrix payoff to analyze the process of economic incentives sharing among the major network components .",
    "a pricing model was proposed in @xcite to study the economic incentives for caching and sharing content in information centric networks which consists of access icns , a transit icn and a content provider .",
    "this work has shown that if each player s caching ( pricing ) strategy remains fixed , the utility of each player becomes a concave function of its own pricing ( caching ) strategy .",
    "therefore a unique nash equilibrium ( _ ne _ ) exists in a non - cooperative pricing ( caching ) game among different players . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", a similar model was adopted to address the problem of joint caching and pricing strategies in a network including two access icns , one transit icn and one content provider .",
    "however , content popularity was not taken into account and the icns were agnostic to content type .",
    "the interaction of the above entities is modeled using game theoretic approach .",
    "it was shown that each player can optimize its caching and pricing strategies in a non - cooperative game . at the ne ,",
    "the caching strategies turn out to be 0 - 1 ( all or nothing ) strategies , where each access icn caches all the requested demand if its caching cost is less than the transit icn s caching cost .",
    "when the caching cost of the access icn is higher than the transit icn s , all the requested content will be served by either the transit icn or the content provider , whichever has the lower caching cost .",
    "it means that the content would be cached in the icn with smallest caching cost . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "none of the earlier works consider the problem of joint caching and pricing in an icn in the presence of content with different popularity .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we study joint caching and pricing strategies with the notion of content popularity for an icn network with different elements considering asymmetric utility functions .",
    "there are @xmath4 different types of content in the network that each user is trying to access .",
    "each type of content has a different measure of popularity reflected by the probability of requests for it .",
    "we consider a model where the popularity of content is uniformly similar in all parts of the network , i.e. , all users in the network have the same file popularity distribution .",
    "analyzing the impact of different per - user file popularities is an open problem . as in previous works ( e.g. @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) , in this paper the distribution of user requests for content is described by a generalized zipf distribution function as follows :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the exponent characterizing the zipf distribution in which @xmath8 makes the distribution uniform and all the content will be identical in popularity , whereas the case of @xmath9 corresponds to one where the content popularity distribution is following the classic zipf s law and more popular content is dominant in the network .",
    "the content is ranked in order of their popularity where content @xmath10 is the @xmath10th most popular content , i.e. , @xmath11 is the most popular content and @xmath12 is the least popular content .    in most of the aforementioned works that have studied in - network caching , the popularity profile of content was assumed to be identical and perfectly known by all the network components . in reality , the demand and popularity are not predictable and certain @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the problem of caching has been studied in @xcite wherein the users have access to demand history but no knowledge about popularity .",
    "several other papers have used learning - based approaches to estimate the popularity profile at the user side @xcite-@xcite . while content learning is more accurate for modeling content popularity , the reason we have used the zipf model is due to ( 1 ) experimental results showing reasonable fit to the zipf model and ( 2 ) analytical tractability provided by the zipf model .",
    "our framework can be extended by changing the demand model and considering a repeated game with a parametric zipf distribution . in each time slot of the game , this parameter can be estimated in an optimal way using a learning process .",
    "although the prices are fixed for all types of content , since the icns want to earn more profit by caching the content , they are more willing to locally store the content which is more popular .",
    "thus , the access icns and the transit icn s caches treat the content differently in regard to their popularity . as the content gets more popular ,",
    "the icns incur less caching costs to locally store the content .",
    "[ t1 ] for a finite cache , the caching costs of access and transit icns is defined to be inversely proportional to the content popularity as follows @xmath13 where , without loss of generality , @xmath14 is a fixed initial caching cost at icn @xmath15 .",

    "the content provider incurs the constant cost @xmath17 for every unit of data that it serves for the transit icn .      for simplicity in illustration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we begin with a hierarchical network model @xcite , @xcite with two access icns ( a and b ) , one transit icn ( c ) , one content provider ( o ) and an arbitrary number of users who can switch from one access icn to another .",
    "the access icns connect the end - users to the content network and the transit icn provides wide - area transport for the access icns while the content provider provides the content for the users .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] also shows the monetary and data flows among different entities with the various prices described in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the network economy depends on two effective factors : caching and pricing . under the assumption that each icn can have access to all content",

    "the caching strategy adopted by each entity is denoted by the parameter @xmath18 that takes values in the interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "every icn decides to cache different types of content independently , therefore , we have a specific caching variable for each type of content . we have denoted @xmath20 , where @xmath21 can either be access or transit icn and @xmath22 is any cache in the network ( possibly another icn or content provider ) , as the fraction of icn @xmath21 s demand for content type @xmath0 that comes from cache @xmath22 .",
    "each icn also has different pricing strategies .",
    "these strategies are the prices that each player charges others for the provided service .",
    "the pricing is based on the usage , i.e. , price per unit data .",
    "each access icn sets two different prices : ( 1 ) the network price per unit data for transporting the content ; and ( 2 ) the storage price per unit data for providing content from its cache for other icns .",
    "for example , the network and storage prices for access icn @xmath23 are denoted as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the total price per unit data is the sum of these two prices and is denoted by @xmath26",

    "as the analytical results show , the nash equilibrium for the symmetric case is independent of number of access icns .",
    "so , for the numerical results section , we consider the scenario with only two access icns .",
    "we consider the interaction among two symmetric access icns , one transit icn and a content provider who are competing to maximize their utilities . in this scenario , the reflective coefficients of price s influence on users demands @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are set identically to 0.1 .",

    "is examined in fig .",
    "[ fig : threshold5 ] . in this case , the transit icn caching cost is half of the access icn caching cost for each type of content .",

    "@xmath141 decreases as the @xmath3 gets higher when the content provider cost @xmath17 is relatively low .",
    "the reason is that as @xmath3 increases , the caching costs of more popular content at access icns caches are getting lower .",
    "therefore , the access icns need to decrease their price @xmath141 in order to compete with other access icns .",
    "but as the relative content provider cost @xmath17 increases , the access price is getting higher since both the access icn and the transit icn have a greater incentive to locally cache the content .",
    "however , the price for greater value of @xmath17 displays a bimodal behavior as a function of @xmath3 . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : accessc2 ] , for relatively small value of @xmath3 , the different types of content have similar popularity and the access and transit icn should incur more or less similar caching costs for each type of content .",
    "but as @xmath3 increases , some of the content is getting more popular and the cost of caching them at the access icn is decreasing .",
    "therefore , the access icn decreases it s access price in order to induce increased demand from the users ( see relationship between @xmath141 and demand in equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) . on the other hand , when @xmath3 keeps increasing , the transit price and the content provider storage price increase .",
    "thus , the access icn needs to slightly increase its price to compensate the increase in the transit price .",
    "after the slight increase , as @xmath3 increases further , the access price @xmath141 decreases again .",
    "this is because , as seen from fig .",
    "4 , the caching strategies @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the same for large @xmath3 . at this point , the access icns decide to cache the content that are more popular to get higher payoff . as a result",
    ", the access icn decreases the price to further incentivize greater user demand for popular content .",
    "the transit price @xmath105 and the content provider storage price @xmath33 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transit ] . as @xmath3 increases , the caching costs of less popular content that are going to be cached in transit icn or content provider caches are increasing .",

    "for various content provider cost @xmath17 and @xmath135,width=377,height=302 ]",
    "in this paper , we developed an analytical framework for distribution of popular content in an information centric network ( icn ) that comprises of access icns , a transit icn and a content provider . by modeling the interaction of the above entities using game theory and under the assumption that the caching cost of the access icns and transit icns is inversely proportional to popularity , which follows a generalized zipf distribution",
    ", we first showed that at the ne , the caching strategies turn out to be 0 - 1 ( all or nothing ) .",
    "further , for the case of symmetric access icns , we showed that a unique nash equilibrium exists and the caching policy ( 0 or 1 ) is determined by a threshold on the popularity of the content ( reflected by the zipf probability metric ) , i.e. , all content more popular than the threshold value is cached .",
    "moreover , we showed that the resulting threshold indices and prices can be obtained by a decomposition of the joint caching and pricing problem into two independent caching only and pricing only problems .",
    "finally , using numerical results we showed that as the zipf s factor @xmath3 increases and the relative popularity of the content gets skewed , the access icn just caches the more popular content and the content provider serves only requests for less popular content while the transit icn just forwards the demands to the content provider without locally caching any content itself .",
    "the insights obtained from the analysis here warrants further investigation into the case of asymmetric access icns . in this paper , we discussed a hierarchical scenario with @xmath38 access icns , one transit icn and one content provider . in the special case that the transit icns are not `` interconnected to each other , the model in this paper is readily extendable for multiple transit icns",
    "however , a generalized scenario with either multiple ' ' interconnected \" transit icns or multiple content providers is a direction for future work .",
    "two sequences @xmath142 and @xmath143 defined in proposition [ p2 ] are concave sequences .              @xmath153\\sum\\limits_{i = th + 1}^{m + 1 } { { q_m}(i ) }   + th{c_{{c_0}}}\\\\   \\rightarrow f\\left ( { th } \\right ) = \\left [ { { c_0}{{\\left ( { th + 1 } \\right)}^\\gamma } } \\right]\\sum\\limits_{i = th + 1}^{m + 1 } { { { \\left ( { \\frac{1}{i } } \\right)}^{^\\gamma } } }   + th{c_{{c_0 } } } \\end{array}$ ]        if this inequality holds for all @xmath4 and @xmath150 , then sequence @xmath152 is concave .",
