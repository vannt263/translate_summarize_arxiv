    "-5 mm    many physically interesting phenomena involve evolutions of singular flows whose velocity fields or vorticity fields change dramatically .",
    "shock waves , vortex sheets , and boundary layer are some of the well - known examples of such singular flows which provide better approximations for significant parts of the flow fields near the physical boundaries , in the mixing layers and trailing wakes , etc . , at high reynolds numbers .",
    "the better understanding of the dynamics of such singular flows is the key in the analysis of general fluid flows governed by the well - known euler ( or navier - stokes ) systems or their variants for both compressible and incompressible fluids , and has been one of the main focuses for applied analysists for decades .",
    "substantial progress has been made in the past in studying singular flows by either rigorous analysis , or numerical simulations , or asymptotic methods [ 18 ] .",
    "in particular , a rather complete theory exists for the 1-d shock wave problems , and both the theoretical understanding and numerical methods for 2-d smooth incompressible flows are quite satisfactory .",
    "yet there are still many important issues to be settled , such as , the global existence of weak solutions and asymptotic structures of various approximate solutions generated by either physical considerations or numerical methods for such singular flows .",
    "one of the fundamental problems in the mathematical theory of shock waves for hyperbolic conservation laws is the well - posedness of the multi - dimensional gas - dynamical shock waves , for which the celebrated glimm s method does not apply .",
    "most of the previous studies along this line deal with either short time structural stability of basic fronts or asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations of dynamics of shock fronts .",
    "due to the great complexity and the lack of understanding , it is reasonable for one to begin with some of the physically relevant wave patterns where a lot of experimental data , numerical simulations , and asymptotic results are available .",
    "one of the basic model for such studies is the supersonic flow past a pointed body [ 4 ] , which is one of the fundamental problems in gas dynamics .",
    "we first study the stationary supersonic gas flow past an infinite curved and symmetric cone .",
    "the flow is governed by the potential equation as well as the boundary conditions on the shock and the surface of the body .",
    "this problem has been studied extensively by either physical experiments or numerical simulations .",
    "the rigorous analysis starts with the work of courant and friedrichs in [ 4 ] , where they show that if a supersonic flow hits a circular cone with axis being parallel to the velocity of the upstream flow and the vertex angle being less than a critical value , then there appears a circular conical shock attached at the tip of the cone , and the flow field between the shock front and the surface of the body can be determined by solving a boundary value problem of a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the local existence of supersonic flow past a pointed body has been established recently [ 1 ] .",
    "our interest is on the structure of the global solution to this problem .",
    "we show that the solution to this problem exists globally in the whole space with a pointed curved shock attached at the tip of the cone and tends to a self - similar solution [ 2 ] .",
    "our analysis is based on a global uniform weighted energy estimate for the linearized problem .",
    "the method we developed in [ 2 ] seems to be quite effective for other multi - dimensional problems . indeed",
    ", similar approach can be used to study unsteady supersonic flows past a curved body for both potential flows and the full euler system , and we obtain the local existence of shock waves in these cases [ 3 ] .    another challenging problem in the mathematical theory of fluid - dynamics is the theoretical foundation of the prandtl s boundary layer theory [ 14 ] . in the presence of physical boundaries , the solutions to the invisicid euler system can not be the uniform asymptotic ansatz of the corresponding navier - stokes system for large reynolds number due to the discrepancies between the no - slip boundary conditions for the navier - stokes system and the slip boundary condition for the euler system . indeed , the physical boundaries will creat vorticity and there is a thin layer ( called boundary layer ) in which the leading order approximation of the flow velocity is governed by the prandtl s system for the boundary layers ( see ( 3.1 ) in section 3 ) .",
    "there are extensive literatures on the theoretical , numerical , and experimental aspects of the prandtl s boundary layer theory [ 14 ] .",
    "yet very little rigorous theory exists for the dynamical boundary layer behavior of the navier - stokes solutions for both compressible and incompressible fluids .",
    "one of the main difficulties is the well - posedness theory in some standard hlder or sobolov spaces for the initial - boundary value problems for the prandtl s system for boundary layers which is a severely degenerate parabolic - elliptic system , for which the only known existence results are proved locally in the analytic class in [ 15 ] , except the series of important works of oleinik who dealt with a class of monotonic data [ 12 ] .",
    "indeed , oleinik considered a plane unsteady flow of viscous incompressible fluid in the presence of an arbitrary injection and removal of the fluid across the boundary . under the monotonicity assumption ( see ( 3.5 ) in section 3 ) , oleinik proved the well - posedness of local classical solutions to the prandtl s system [ 12 ] .",
    "one of the open questions posed in [ 12 ] is to prove the global well - posedness of solution for the prandtl s system under suitable conditions .",
    "recently , we establish a global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the 2-d prandtl s system for unsteady boundary layers in the class considered by oleinik provided that the pressure is favorable .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a viscous splitting method and new weighted total variation estimate [ 16,17 ] .",
    "see section 3 and [ 16,17 ] for more details .",
    "finally , we turn to the motion of vortex sheets , which corresponds to a singular inviscid flow where the vorticity field is zero except on lower - dimensional surfaces , the sheets , and can be characterized as inviscid flows with finite local energy and with vorticity fields being finite radon measures .",
    "the study on the existence and structure of solutions for the inviscid euler system for incompressible fluids with data in such class is of fundamental importance both physically and mathematically .",
    "physically , vortex sheets can be used to model important flows such as high reynolds number shear layers , and have many engineering applications .",
    "mathematically , the evolution of a vortex sheets gives a classical example of ill - posed problem in the sense of hadamard , a curvature singularity developes in finite time , and the nature of the solution past singularity formation is of great interest to know .",
    "this gives rise to many interesting yet challenging problems .",
    "some of these are : is there a well - posedness theory of classical weak solutions to the inviscid euler system with general vortex sheets initial data ?",
    "what are the structures of the approximate solutions to vortex sheets motions generated by either navier - stokes solutions or pratical numerical methods ( such as particle method ) ?",
    "can vorticity concentration and energy defects occur dynamically ? etc .. despite the importance of these problems and past intensive effort in rigorous mathematical analysis , these problems are far from being solved .",
    "better understanding has been achieved before singularity formation in the analytical setting , and studies on global weak solutions and their approximations start with the important works of diperna - majda [ 6 ] .",
    "delort observes that no vorticity concentration implies that a weak limit in @xmath0 of an approximate solution sequences is in fact a classical weak solution to the two - dimensional euler system , and thus proved the first existence of global ( in time ) classical weak solution to the 2-d incompressible euler equations with vortex sheets initial data provided that the initial vorticity is of distinguished sign [ 5 ] .",
    "similar ideas have been used to study the convergence of approximate solutions generated by either viscous regularization [ 11 ] or partical methods [ 8,9 ] for vortex sheets with one sign vorticity . in the case",
    "that vorticity may change sign , the vortex sheets motion becomes extremely complex after singularity formation .",
    "indeed , many important features of irregular flows seem to be connected with interactions and intertwining of regions of both positive and negative vorticities . here",
    "we consider a mirror - symmetric flow which allows interactions but excludes intertwining of regions of distinguish vorticity , prove that there is no vorticity concentrations for approximate solution of such flow , and thus give the first global ( in time ) existence of vortex sheets motion with two - sign vorticity .",
    "we also consider the 3-d axisymmetric vortex motions .",
    "it is well - known that for smooth flows , the analysis for the axisymmetric 3-d euler system without swirls is almost identitial to that of 2-d incompressible euler system .",
    "however , this parallelness breaks down for the vortex sheets motions .",
    "indeed , we will show that there exist no energy concentrations in approximate solutions to vortex sheets motion with one - sign vorticity for steady axisymmetric 3-d euler system without swirls [ 7 ] .",
    "some partial results on unsteady axisymmetric vortex sheets motion will also be discussed .",
    "-5 mm    a projectile moving in the air with supersonic speed , is governed by the inviscid compressible euler systems @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the density , the velocity and the pressure respectively .",
    "we will only treat the polytropic gases so that @xmath4 with gas constant @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the adiabatic exponent .",
    "suppose that there is a uniform supersonic flow @xmath8 with constant density @xmath9 which comes from negative infinity .",
    "then the flow can be described by the steady euler system . if we assume further that the flow is irrotational , so that one can introduce a potential function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "then the bernoulli s law implies that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the specific enthalpy defined by @xmath14 . in this case , ( 2.1 ) is reduced to a second order quasilinear equation @xmath15 which can be verified to be strictly hyperbolic with respect to @xmath16 if @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the sound speed given by @xmath19 .",
    "the flow hits a point body , whose surface is denoted by @xmath20 . since no flow can cross the boundary , the natural boundary condition is @xmath21    if the vertex angle of the tangential cone of the pointed body is less than a critical value , it is then expected that a shock front is attached at the tip of the pointed body .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the equation of the shock front , then the rankine - hugoniot conditions become @xmath23 = 0 , \\quad \\phi \\quad { \\rm is\\ continuous } , \\quad { \\rm on } \\quad \\mu ( x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) = 0.\\ ] ]    our aim is to find a solution to this free boundary value problem , ( 2.2)(2.4 ) .",
    "when the pointed body is small perturbation of a circular cone , the local existence of solution to the problem ( 2.2)(2.4 ) has been established in [ 1 ] .",
    "our main goal is to establish a global solution .",
    "however , such a global shock wave might not exist in general for arbitrary pointed body due to the possibility of development of new shock waves in the large .",
    "thus we assume further that the pointed body is a curved and symmetric cone . in this case",
    ", it will be more convenient to rewrite the problem ( 2.2)(2.4 ) in terms of polar coordinates @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "assume that the tip of the pointed body locates at the origin , the equation of the surface of the body is @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and the equation of the shock front is @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "set @xmath31 .",
    "then ( 2.2) ( 2.4 ) become @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 s^{'}(z ) + [ \\ptl_r\\,\\varphi\\,h ] = 0 \\quad { \\rm on } \\quad r = s(z).\\ ] ] moreover , the potential @xmath35 is continuous on the shock , so it should satisfy @xmath36 .",
    "then in [ 2 ] , we have shown that the problem ( 2.5)(2.7 ) has a globally defined solution as summarized in the following theorem :    assume that a curved and symmetric cone is given such that @xmath37 , and @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being some suitable integers .",
    "suppose that a supersonic polytropic flow parallel to the @xmath41-axis comes from negative infinite with velocity @xmath42 , and density @xmath43 .",
    "then for suitably small @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the boundary value problem ( 2.5)(2.7 ) admits a global weak entropy solution with a pointed shock front attached at the origin .",
    "moreover , the location of the shock front and the flow field between the shock and the surface of the body tend to the corresponding ones for the flow past the unperturbed circular cone @xmath47 with the rate @xmath48 .    it should be noted that there are no other discontinuities in our solution besides the main shock . since the deviation of the surface of the body from that of a circular cone is sufficiently small ( see ( 2.8 ) ) , any possible compression of the flow will be absorbed by the main shock .",
    "this is the mechanism to prevent the formation of any new shocks inside the flow field caused by the perturbation of the body . in particular ,",
    "our results demonstrate that self - similar solution with a strong shock is structurally stable in a global sense .",
    "indeed , the key element in the proof of theorem 2.1 is to establish some global uniform weighted energy estimates for the linearized problem of ( 2.5)(2.7 ) around the self - similar solution with a strong shock obtained when the pointed body is a circular cone .",
    "this is achieved by a deliberate choice of multipliers which must satisfy a system of ordinary differential inequalities with complicated coefficients due to the structure of the background self - similar solution and the requirement of obtaining global estimates independent of @xmath41 for the potential function and its derivatives on the boundary as well as its interior of a domain .    when the projectile changes its speed , or it confronts some airstream , then the flow around the projectile will be time - dependent .",
    "thus , we also consider the unsteady supersonic flow past a pointed body .",
    "although our analysis applies to more general case [ 3 ] , here we will only present the result for two - dimensional polytropic , unsteady , and irrotational flow past a curved wedge . for simplicity in presentation , we also assume that both the wedge and the perturbed incoming flow from infinity are symmetric about @xmath49-axis .",
    "let @xmath50 with @xmath51 be the equation of the wedge , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 be the equation of the shock front .",
    "then in terms of the velocity potential function @xmath54 ( so that @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , we are looking for solutions to the following initial boundary value problem @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 \\ptl_t\\,s + [ h\\,\\ptl_{x_1}\\,\\varphi ] \\ptl_{x_1}\\,s - [ h\\,\\ptl_{x_2}\\,\\phi ] = 0 \\quad { \\rm on } \\quad x_2 = s(t , x_1),\\ ] ] @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are suitably small perturbations of the corresponding shock location and potential function respectively for the steady flow",
    ". then we have the following local existence result [ 3 ] .",
    "there exist positive constant @xmath64 and @xmath65 and functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 defined on the regions @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 respectively such that @xmath71 , @xmath72 solves the problem ( 2.9)(2.12 ) .",
    "-5 mm    consider a plane unsteady flow of viscous incompressible fluid in the presence of an arbitrary injection and removal of the fluid across the boundaries . in this case",
    ", the corresponding prandtl s system takes the form @xmath73 in the region , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are positive constants .",
    "the initial and boundary conditions can be imposed as @xmath77 with @xmath78 given as is determined by the corresponding euler flow .",
    "the pressure @xmath79 in ( 3.1 ) is determined by the bernoulli s law : @xmath80 .",
    "it follows from the physical ground that one may assume that @xmath81    due to the degeneracy in the prandtl s system ( 3.1 ) , the problem of well - posedness theory of solutions to the problem ( 3.1)(3.3 ) in the standard hlder space or sobolov space is quite difficult . in a series of important works by oleinik and her coauthors [ 12 ] , they studied this problem under the additional assumption that the data are monotonic in the sense that @xmath82 and prove that there exists a unique local classical smooth solution to the initial - boundary value problem ( 3.1)(3.3 ) provided that the data are monotonic in the sense of ( 3.4 ) . here by local we mean that @xmath76 is small if @xmath83 is given and fixed , and @xmath76 is arbitrary if @xmath83 is small .",
    "one of the open problem in [ 12 ] is : what are the conditions ensuring the global in time existence and uniqueness of solutions to the problem ( 3.1)(3.4 ) for arbitrarily given @xmath83 ? in [ 16,17 ] , we study such problem and establish the global ( in time ) existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the initial - boundary value problem ( 3.1)(3.4 ) in the case that the pressure is favorable , i.e. , @xmath84    more precisely , we have ( [ 16,17 ] ) :    consider the initial - boundary value problem for the 2-d prandtl s system , ( 3.1)(3.2 ) .",
    "assume that the initial and boundary data satisfy the constraints ( 3.3 ) , ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) .",
    "then there exists a unique global bounded weak solutions to the initial - boundary value problem ( 3.1)(3.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , these solutions are lipschitz continuous in both space and time .",
    "we remark here that the condition ( 3.5 ) , that the pressure is favorable , is exactly what fluid - dynamists believe for the stability of a laminar boundary layer .",
    "this is also consistent with the case of stationary flows [ 12 ] . in the case of pressure",
    "adverse , i.e. , @xmath85 , separation of boundary layer may occur , so one would not expect the long time existence of solution to ( 3.1)(3.3 ) . finally , we remark that in the case that ( 3.5 ) fails as in many pratical physical situations , short time existence of regular solution is still expected , which has not been established yet .",
    "-5 mm    two - dimensional vortex sheets motion corresponds to an inviscid flow whose vorticity is zero except on one - dimensional curves , the sheets .",
    "thus , it is governed by the following cauchy problem @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the velocity field , @xmath88 is the vorticity , and @xmath89 is the biot - sawart kernel , and @xmath90 denotes the space of finite radon measures in @xmath91 . let @xmath92 be a sequence of approximate solution to ( 4.1 ) with the following bounds @xmath93      two main questions arise : is @xmath98 a classical weak solution to problem ( 4.1 ) ? does either vorticity concentration ( i.e. @xmath99 for some @xmath100 ) occur ?",
    "it is clear from the structure of the 2-d euler system that no energy defects implies strong @xmath0-convergence of the velocity field and thus the existence of the classical weak solution to ( 4.1 ) .",
    "a less obvious fact is that no vorticity concentration also implies the weak limit @xmath98 being a classical solution to ( 4.1 ) , which follows from the vorticity formulation of ( 4.1 ) as observed by delort [ 5 ] .",
    "then the convergence to a classical weak solution to the cauchy problem ( 4.1 ) is proved for approximate solutions generated by either regularizing the initial data [ 5 ] , or navier - stokes approximation [ 11 ] , or vortex blob methods [ 8 ] , or point vortex methods [ 9 ] provided that the initial vorticity is of distinguished sign . to study the corresponding issues for flows where interactions of regions of both positive and negative vorticities are allowed , in [",
    "10 ] , we study a 2-d mirror - symmetric vortex sheets motion whose vorticity is a integrable perturbation of a non - negative mirror - symmetric radon measure . here a radon measure @xmath101 is said to be non - negative mirror - symmetric ( nms ) if @xmath102 and @xmath101 is odd with respect to @xmath103 .",
    "then the main results in [ 10 ] can be summarized as    assume that @xmath104 such that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "then there exists a global ( in time ) classical solution @xmath107 to the initial value problem ( 4.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , this weak solution can be obtained as a limit of either a sequence of smooth inviscid solutions or a sequence of solutions to the navier - stokes system .",
    "it should be noted that this is the only result of existence of classical weak solution to ( 4.1 ) involving vorticities with different signs .",
    "this is proved by showing @xmath108 as @xmath109 uniformly in @xmath110 , i.e. , no vorticity concentration occur any where .",
    "theorem 4.1 also indicates that interactions of regions of positive and negative vorticities without interwining may not cause concentration in vorticity .",
    "there remain many important open problems for the 2-d vortex sheets motion such as the existence of classical weak solution to ( 4.1 ) for general vortex sheets initial data , and whether energy defects occur dynamically even in the case of one - sign vorticity .",
    "finally , we consider 3-d axisymmetric vortex sheets motions . in cylindrical coordinate ,",
    "@xmath111 , axisymmetric solutions of 3-d euler system have the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "the axisymmetric flow is said without swirls if @xmath116 . in this case , the vorticity field is given by @xmath117 with @xmath118 , and @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "thus , for smooth data , the theory for 3-d axisymmetric euler system without swirls is almost parallel to that of 2-d euler equation .",
    "however , this similarity breaks down for vortex sheets motions . indeed , in sharp contrast to the 2-d case , we show in [ 7 ] that there are no energy defects for a suitable sequence of approximate solutions for 3-d steady axisymmetric vortex sheets motion with one - signed vorticity .",
    "precisely , we have    let @xmath121 be smooth axisymmetric solution to the 3-d steady euler system : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , for some given axisymmetric function @xmath125 with @xmath126 weakly in @xmath127 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath130 be the weak limit of @xmath131 in @xmath132 .",
    "then @xmath130 is a classical weak solution to @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , there exists a subsequence @xmath135 of @xmath136 such that @xmath137 converges to @xmath130 strongly in @xmath132 .",

    "theorem 4.3 implies that if there are no energy defects away from the symmetry axis , then strong @xmath0-convergence takes place .",
