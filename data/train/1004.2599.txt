    "in modern cosmology , the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe is a great encouraging development .",
    "this result was firstly shown by the observations of the distant sne ia @xcite , which can be seen as a standard candle @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the cmb measurement by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and the large scale structure survey by sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite support the same result as the sne ia presented .",
    "to explain the acceleration of the universe , many cosmological models were introduced , including the quintessence @xcite , the brane world @xcite , the chaplygin gas @xcite and the holographic dark energy models @xcite and so on .",
    "the most popular model is referred as @xmath1cdm cosmology composed of cold pressureless dark matter with the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath5 and einstein s cosmological constant @xmath1 which is the most economic and the oldest form of dark energy with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this model provides a reasonably good fit to most current cosmological data @xcite .",
    "additionally , one also consider another cosmological model ",
    "xcdm parametrization which is useful in describing the time - varying dark energy models . in this model",
    ", the dark energy is assumed to be a perfect fluid with the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a number less than @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath10 gravity models are also constrained using the statistical lens sample from sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search data release 3 ( sqls dr3 ) @xcite .    with the perfect observational data , one can compare the observational results with theoretical predictions of different models and determine which model is better @xcite .",
    "besides , another important task of cosmology is to constrain the cosmological parameters of various cosmological models using the redshift - dependent quantities , for example the luminosity distance to a particular class of objects such as sne ia and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "x - ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters is also very popular @xcite .",
    "recently , the size of the bao peak detected in the large - scale correlation function of luminous red galaxies from sdss @xcite and the cmb shift parameter @xmath11 obtained from acoustic oscillations in the cmb temperature anisotropy power spectrum @xcite are also widely used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "recently , one method based on the observational hubble parameter @xmath0 data as a function of redshift @xmath12 , which are related to the differential ages of the oldest galaxies has been used to test cosmological models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the new observations have given more ohd data @xcite .",
    "these new released data may improve the constraints of cosmological parameters evidently .",
    "except that , the latest measurements of the radial baryon acoustic oscillation ( rbao ) were discussed deeply @xcite .",
    "lin et al s work @xcite has shown that the constraints using different data can provide some different results but more consistent with each other . and",
    "the combinations of varieties of data can also make the constraints tighter @xcite . following this direction ,",
    "we intend to further examine the role ohd played in constraining the cosmological parameters by using rbao .",
    "we compare the constraints on the @xmath1cdm cosmology and xcdm cosmology using ohd and sne ia data combined with rbao and cmb data .",
    "we find that the ohd plays the same role as sne ia for joint cosmological constraints .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : data ] we describe the observational data we used in this paper . in sec.[sec : model ] we present the dark energy models . in sec.[sec : constraint ] , we show the constraints . and finally , we give our conclusion .",
    "the luminosity distance of type ia supernova(sne ia ) , @xmath13 , can be estimated by the relation    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the k - corrected observed apparent magnitude and @xmath16 the absolute magnitude of sne ia .",

    "the function @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the expansion rate that has different forms in different cosmological models .",
    "@xmath29 is the hubble constant and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the matter , cosmological constant and curvature density parameters respectively .",
    "the distance modulus is    @xmath33},\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 .",
    "we use the observational sne ia data @xcite with redshift spans from about 0.01 to 1.75 .",
    "in addition , the measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath0 is increasingly becoming important in cosmological constraints , and it can be derived from the derivation of redshift @xmath12 with respect to the cosmic time @xmath35",
    "@xcite    @xmath36    which provides a direct measurement for @xmath0 through a determination of @xmath37 .",
    "jimenez et al demonstrated the feasibility of the method by applying it to a @xmath38 sample@xcite . with the availability of new galaxy surveys , it becomes possible to determine @xmath0 at @xmath39 . by using the different ages of passively evolving galaxies determined from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) @xcite and archival data @xcite , simon et al .",
    "derived a set of observational @xmath0 data @xcite .",
    "the detailed estimation method can be found in the work @xcite . as @xmath12 has a relatively wide range , @xmath40 ,",
    "these data are expected to provide a more full - scale description of the dynamical evolution of our universe .",
    "the application of ohd to cosmology can be referred to @xcite .",
    "the cmb shift parameter @xmath11 is arguably one of the most model - independent parameters among those which can be inferred from cmb data , provided that the dark energy density parameter is negligible at recombination , and it does not depend on @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "it is directly proportional to the ratio of the angular diameter distance to the decoupling epoch divided by the hubble horizon size at the decoupling epoch .",
    "that is ,    @xmath41,\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the redshift of recombination .",
    "the value of @xmath11 obtained from acoustic oscillations in the cmb temperature anisotropy power spectrum is @xmath43 @xcite .      the measurement of the large - scale structure baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak length scale has been found efficient to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "gazta@xmath44aga recently used sdss data to measure the radial baryon acoustic scale in two redshift ranges @xmath45 .",
    "the radial baryon acoustic scale is independent from the previous bao measurement which was either averaged over all direction or just in the transverse direction .",
    "the data used was listed in their table.i in @xcite . theoretically the radial bao peak scale is given by    @xmath46    where @xmath0 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath12 , @xmath47 is the sound horizon at the time of recombination , and @xmath48 is the speed of light respectively .",
    "@xmath47 can be computed as @xcite    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the redshift of the last - scattering surface .",
    "we adopt the wmap 5-year recommended values @xmath51 . while @xmath52 is the angular diameter distance , it can be easily computed in a given cosmological model .",
    "we apply the data listed in sec.ii with the predictions of two cosmological models including dark energy .",
    "the models we consider are standard @xmath1cdm and xcdm parametrization of the dark energy s equation of state .",
    "as mentioned above , the difference of the two models is existed in the expansion rate    @xmath53    in both of the two models the background evolution is described by two parameters .",
    "one is the nonrelativistic matter fractional energy density parameter @xmath30 and the other one is a parameter that characterizes the dark energy . for the @xmath1cdm model ,",
    "the parameter is the cosmological constant fractional energy density parameter @xmath31 . in the xcdm parametrization ,",
    "it is the equation of state parameter @xmath8 . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the xcdm model is the spatially - flat while in the @xmath1cdm case , the spatial curvature is allowed to vary , with the space curvature fractional energy density parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the role of ohd and sne ia data in the constraints on cosmological parameters with different cosmological models .",
    "the likelihood for the cosmological parameters can be determined from a @xmath55 statistics .",
    "for rbao in @xmath1cdm as an example , @xmath56 to get the constraint results of two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we marginalize the likelihood functions over @xmath2 by integrating the probability density @xmath57 .",
    "thus we can obtain the best fitting results and the confidence regions in the @xmath4 plane . in the calculation , we assume a prior of @xmath58 as wmap5 suggested , and this method can improve the constraints greatly @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : lcdmfull ] shows the constraints of each data without any combination for @xmath1cdm model .",
    "it can be easily seen that the confidence regions for each data are almost different . and the best fitting results they give are also different .",
    "both rbao and cmb data prefer a nearly flat universe .    0.0 in    0.1 in    0.1 in    0.0 in    0.1 in    0.1 in    in order to compare the contribution of ohd and sne ia data in constraining the cosmological parameters clearly , it is effective to combine the different data together .",
    "fig.[fig : lcdm ] presents the combined constraints of ohd and sne ia data with rbao and cmb respectively .",
    "it is shown from the table.[tab : lcdm ] that there are slight differences on the best fitting values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "however , the consistency of the results which is more important indicates that the ohd and sne ia data give almost the same contribution in constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "we also calculate the one - dimensional probability distribution function(pdf)@xmath59 for selections of parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 with a prior of @xmath2 .",
    "fig.[fig : lcdmohd ] presents the pdf of @xmath30 and @xmath31 for rbao+cmb+ohd and rbao+cmb+sne ia respectively .",
    "the 1 and 2@xmath60 confidence levels are also shown .",
    "it is easy to see that the most probable value of the two results are roughly consistent with each other .    from the constraints of combined data and the one - dimensional probability distribution function",
    ", we can see that some slight discrepancy are shown between the constraints of ohd and sne ia combined with other data .",
    "however , both the constraints are almost the same restrictive .",
    "and their results prefer a nearly flat universe . applying the data we used above to the xcdm model ,",
    "first we get fig.[fig : xcdmfull ] that shows the constraints of the alone data used in fig.[fig : lcdmfull ] . while fig.[fig : xcdm ] shows the combined constraints as fig.[fig : lcdm ] .",
    "it is clear that the constraints of rbao+cmb+ohd and rbao+cmb+sne ia are both restrictive at the confidence level of 68.3% .",
    "the best - fit results of these constraints are listed in table.[tab : xcdm ] . in order to examine",
    "if the ohd and sne ia data play the same role in constraining the cosmological parameters as in @xmath1cdm model , the one - dimensional probability distribution function(pdf ) is also calculated .",
    "the pdf curves are plotted in fig.[fig : xcdmohd ] . from the results listed above",
    ", we can see that the constraints of the parameter @xmath30 using the two data combinations are consistent with each other .",
    "the main discrepancy is in constraining @xmath8 .",
    "the 1@xmath60 confidence region of @xmath8 achieved from rbao+cmb+ohd is @xmath61 , while rbao+cmb+sne ia suggests @xmath62 .",
    "the reason that causes the difference is that the amount of the ohd is so few . with more data achieved in the future",
    ", many deficiencies will be improved .",

    "recent observations have provided a lot of information to analyze the dynamical behavior of the universe .",
    "most of them are based on distance measurements , such as sne ia . and",
    "the present bao peak scale data and cmb data are both sparse and can not provide a tight constraint on dark energy parameters .",
    "it is important to use other different probes to set bonds on the cosmological parameters .",
    "following this direction , we used the observational @xmath0 data from the differential ages of the passively evolving galaxies to constrain the @xmath1cdm cosmology and xcdm cosmology , combining rbao and cmb . in order to verify the ohd data",
    "can give almost the same contribution in constraining the cosmological parameters as other widely used data , we compared the sne ia data in the same way of calculation .    for the @xmath1cdm universe with a prior of @xmath2 ,",
    "the best - fit result of rbao+cmb+ohd and rbao+cmb+sne ia indicate a nearly flat universe . the constraints of these two data combinations are both very tight and consistent with each other . for the flat xcdm universe with the same prior",
    ", there exists some discrepancy in the constraints , especially for the parameter @xmath8 , however , the constraint results of @xmath30 obtained from the two data combination rbao+cmb+ohd and rbao+cmb+sne ia are almost the same .    from the above comparison and previous works @xcite , we find that our results from the observational @xmath0 data are believable and the computation results are consistent with the results using the data of sne ia .",
    "so the observational @xmath0 data can be seen as a complementarity to other cosmological probes . with a large amount of ohd in a wider range of redshift @xmath12 in the future",
    ", we probably can constrain the cosmological parameters using ohd instead or combined with other data .",
