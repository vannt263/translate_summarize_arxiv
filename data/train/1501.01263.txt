    "an intense laser field significantly modifies the bremsstrahlung ( brs ) process accompanying electron - atom or electron - ion scattering , i.e. , an electron colliding with a target can efficiently convert the combined energies of a number of laser photons , each with energy @xmath0 , into the energy of a spontaneously emitted photon @xmath1 . in comparison with field - free brs , in laser - assisted brs ( labrs ) the spectral energies can be significantly extended and resonant - like enhancements of the labrs cross sections may appear .",
    "there have been relatively few prior studies of labrs processes .",
    "karapetyan and fedorov  @xcite have shown that labrs spectra for electron scattering from a coulomb potential exhibit resonant peaks ( at @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is integer ) , which occur only in the limit of an intense laser field .",
    "the electron - coulomb interaction was treated in  @xcite within the born approximation .",
    "zhou and rosenberg  @xcite investigated labrs beyond the born approximation in the scattering potential for the case of a low - frequency laser field .",
    "they found a series of resonant peaks in the brs spectrum , separated by @xmath0 , that are related to resonant features in field - free electron - atom scattering .",
    "the approach used in  @xcite is based on the low - frequency kroll - watson result  @xcite for the electron scattering state and its `` resonant '' modification .",
    "these two seminal works by karapetyan and fedorov  @xcite and by zhou and rosenberg  @xcite have led to a number of more recent analyses .",
    "these have been described briefly in section 4.5 of the review of ehlotzky _ et al . _",
    "a comparative analysis of labrs for electron - coulomb scattering within the born and low - frequency approximations ( in accordance with  @xcite and  @xcite respectively ) has been given in a recent paper by dondera and florescu  @xcite , who also review there other works on non - relativistic labrs .",
    "a common feature of the above works is that they do not describe effects of laser - induced electron rescattering on an atomic target .",
    "these rescattering effects are well known in multiphoton processes involving bound atomic states , such as high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) and above - threshold ionization / detachment ( ati / atd ) . in those processes",
    "they lead to the appearance of broad , plateau - like structures in the hhg and ati / atd spectra  @xcite .",
    "also , plateaus in the high - energy ( multiphoton ) spectra of laser - assisted collisional processes involving an initially free ( i.e. , continuum ) electron have been predicted for laser - assisted electron scattering ( laes )  @xcite and laser - assisted radiative recombination / attachment ( larr / lara )  @xcite .",
    "interest in such plateaus centers on the possibility of transferring large amounts of energy from a laser field into either electron kinetic energy or high - energy spontaneous photons ( or harmonics ) without significant decreases in the yields as the number @xmath4 of absorbed photons increases over a wide interval of @xmath4 .",
    "the theoretical description of laser - assisted electron - atom processes for the case of an intense laser field necessarily requires an accurate treatment of both the electron - laser and electron - atom interactions in order to properly describe the strong field plateau phenomena . an appropriate approach that meets this requirement",
    "is based on time - dependent effective range ( tder ) theory  @xcite , which combines the effective range theory ( for the electron - atom interaction ) with the quasienergy or floquet theory ( for the electron - laser field interaction ) .",
    "this approach was employed recently to describe resonant phenomena in the labrs process  @xcite .",
    "namely , a resonant mechanism for labrs involving the resonant transition into a laser - dressed intermediate quasi - bound state ( corresponding respectively to a field - free bound state of either a neutral atom or a negative ion ) accompanied by ionization or detachment of this state by the laser field has been considered . however , rescattering effects were not investigated in  @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the tder theory is that it allows an accurate quantum derivation of closed - form analytic formulas for the cross sections of strong field processes that take into account the rescattering effects non - perturbatively in the limit of a low frequency laser field .",
    "such formulas were obtained for both laser - induced processes ( such as hhg  @xcite and ati / atd  @xcite ) and laser - assisted collisional processes ( such as laes  @xcite and larr / lara  @xcite ) . for collisional processes ,",
    "the analytic formulas describe accurately the high - energy part of the electron ( for laes ) or photon ( for larr / lara ) spectra , which can not be described using the well - known bunkin - fedorov  @xcite or kroll - watson  @xcite approximations .",
    "the analytic results have a factorized structure , in which the atomic factors represent exact field - free amplitudes evaluated using the instantaneous kinetic electron momenta in the laser field , thus allowing us to generalize the effective range approximation to the case of an arbitrary atomic potential .    in this paper , we consider rescattering effects in nonresonant labrs , i.e. , we study the process of spontaneous photon emission during electron - atom scattering for electron energies and laser field parameters such that resonant radiative ( spontaneous or stimulated ) transitions into an intermediate quasi - bound state are negligible and thus are not taken into account . in the low - frequency approximation",
    ", we derive an analytic description of the rescattering plateau features in labrs spectra and analyze numerically the accuracy of the derived analytic formulas .",
    "these analytic results permit a transparent physical interpretation and present the first quantum justification of the three - step rescattering scenario for the description of radiative ( with emission of a spontaneous photon ) continuum - continuum transitions of an electron interacting with both an atomic potential and an intense laser field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present results for the labrs amplitude in terms of the exact tder expressions for initial and final states of the scattered electron . in section 3",
    "we present an analysis of the labrs amplitude in the limit of low frequencies .",
    "we start in section 3.1 with the low - frequency expansion of the most important ingredient determining a tder scattering state . in section 3.2",
    "we present the low - frequency result for the amplitude for `` direct '' labrs , i.e. , neglecting rescattering .",
    "basic results ( [ d : resc2 ] )  ( [ tdp2 ] ) for the `` rescattering '' part , @xmath5 , of the labrs amplitude are obtained in section 3.3 using the regular saddle point method .",
    "based on results of section 3.3 , in section 3.4 we discuss the three - step rescattering scenario for the labrs process and its relation to the corresponding scenario for laes . in section 3.5",
    "we consider the case of two merging saddle points , which requires the use of special saddle point methods in order to estimate the contributions of coalescing electron trajectories to the rescattering amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "our numerical results and discussions are presented in section 4 . in section 4.1",
    "we demonstrate good agreement between exact tder results and those obtained in the low - frequency approximation for the high - energy rescattering plateau part of labrs spectra .",
    "we discuss there also some peculiarities in labrs spectra ( such as their oscillation patterns and interference enhancements ) . in section 4.2",
    "we generalize our tder results , which are valid for a short - range atomic potential , to the case of labrs in a coulomb potential and present numerical estimates for electron - proton labrs . in section 5",

    "the strong enhancement of the spectral density beyond the rescattering plateau cutoff ( for @xmath422  ev ) is related to resonant labrs due to radiative recombination into an intermediate quasibound state of the h@xmath423 ion  @xcite . as shown in  @xcite ( cf .",

    "the disagreement of the nonresonant low - frequency results with the exact tder theory results for energies 2.5  ev@xmath428  ev ( where the labrs spectrum exhibits a suppression similar to the suppression in figure  [ spectr ] for 2  ev@xmath428  ev ) is also caused by the previously discussed resonant channel .      since the analytic results  ( [ dipzr ] ) , ( [ tdp1 ] ) and  ( [ tdp2 ] ) contain field - free atomic factors evaluated at laser - modified instantaneous momenta , they allow one to extend their applicability beyond the assumptions of the tder theory .",
    "this extension is very straightforward and consists in the replacement of the atomic factors @xmath183 and @xmath429 obtained within the tder approach by their counterparts for a real atomic potential .",
    "we emphasize that the propagation factors @xmath220 and @xmath418 ( that describe key aspects of rescattering in the labrs process ) do not involve any information about electron - atom interactions and are general for any atomic target . in figure",
    "[ spectr : c ] we present labrs spectra for the case of the electron - coulomb interaction , i.e. for electron - proton brs .",
    "the field - free quantities for this case are the electron - coulomb scattering amplitude @xmath199 , obtained from  @xcite , and the brs dipole moment @xmath430 , obtained from  @xcite . in figure",

    "in this paper , we have developed an analytic description of the labrs process taking into account the rescattering effects of the active electron on the atomic target .",
    "these effects are responsible for the occurrence of the high - energy plateau in the dependence of the labrs spectral density on the emitted photon energy ( or on the number of laser photons exchanged )",
    ". the key results of our analytic approach are the expressions  ( [ tdp1 ] ) and  ( [ tdp2 ] ) , which present the labrs dipole moment ( the labrs amplitude ) in the nonresonant low - frequency approximation .",
    "these results have a transparent interpretation in terms of the rescattering scenario .",

    "similarly , the result  ( [ tdp2 ] ) for @xmath447 describes the scenario ii : ( i ) the brs process happens at the first electron - atom collision at the time @xmath188 , ( ii ) the laser field returns the electron back to the atom at the moment @xmath106 ( @xmath448 ) , followed by ( iii ) the elastic electron scattering ( the rescattering event ) .",
    "the pair of times @xmath449 corresponds to some closed trajectory of the electron s motion in the laser field between the events of the first and second electron - atom collisions .",
    "we have found that the scenario ii with spontaneous photon emission during the first collision is allowed for an arbitrary incident electron energy @xmath226 .",
    "numerical analysis shows that this scenario is significant for such values of the final electron energy @xmath271 that @xmath280 .",
    "another situation is realized for the scenario i , with photon emission during the second collision ( rescattering ) . for this case",
    ", the dipole moment @xmath445 can contribute to the labrs amplitude for @xmath450 , and exceeds the term @xmath447 only for @xmath451 ( for the case of the parallel geometry @xmath452 ) . in comparison with the direct labrs process ,",
    "the rescattering effects significantly extend the maximum energy of the emitted photon ( up to the rescattering plateau cutoff ) , while the averaged value of the spectral density is about 2    3 orders of magnitude smaller than for the direct process .",
    "finally , the clear physical meaning of the key factors involved in the tder results  ( [ tdp1 ] ) and  ( [ tdp2 ] ) allow us to generalize those factors to the case of real atoms or ions .",
