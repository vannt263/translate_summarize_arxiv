    "cooperative control of multi - agent systems constitutes a highly active area of research during the last two decades .",
    "typical objectives are the consensus problem , which is concerned with finding a protocol that achieves convergence to a common value @xcite , reference tracking @xcite and formation control @xcite .",
    "a common feature in the approach to these problems is the design of decentralized control laws in order to achieve a global goal .    in the case of mobile robot networks with limited sensing and communication ranges ,",
    "connectivity maintenance plays a fundamental role @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is required to constrain the control input in such a way that the network topology remains connected during the evolution of the system .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the rendezvous and formation control problems are studied while preserving connectivity , whereas in @xcite swarm aggregation is achieved by means of a control scheme that guarantees both connectivity and collision avoidance .    in our approach",
    "we provide a control law for each agent comprising of a decentralized feedback component and a free input term , which ensures connectivity maintenance , for all possible free input signals up to a certain bound of magnitude .",
    "the motivation for this approach comes from distributed control and coordination of multi - agent systems with locally assigned linear temporal logic ( ltl ) specifications . in particular , by virtue of the invariance and robust connectivity maintenance properties , it is possible to define well posed decentralized abstractions for the multi - agent system which can be exploited for motion planning .",
    "the latter problem has been studied in our recent work @xcite for the single integrator dynamics case .    in this work ,",
    "we design a bounded control law which results in network connectivity of the system for all future times provided that the initial relative distances of interconnected agents and the free input terms satisfy appropriate bounds .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a spherical domain , it is shown that adding an extra repulsive vector field near the boundary of the domain can also guarantee invariance of the solutions and simultaneously maintain the robust connectivity property .",
    "the latter framework enables the construction of finite abstractions for the single integrator case .",
    "the rest of the report is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces basic notation and preliminaries . in section 3 ,",
    "results on robust connectivity maintenance are provided and explicit controllers which establish this property are designed . in section 4 ,",
    "the corresponding controllers are appropriately modified , in order to additionally guarantee invariance of the solution for the case of a spherical domain .",
    "we summarize the results and discuss possible extensions in section 5 .",
