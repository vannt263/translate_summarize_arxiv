    "<S> studies of limits on active - sterile neutrino mixing derived from big bang nucleosynthesis considerations are extended to consider the dependance of these constraints on the primordial deuterium abundance . </S>",
    "<S> this study is motivated by recent measurements of d / h in quasar absorption systems , which at present yield discordant results . </S>",
    "<S> limits on active - sterile mixing are somewhat relaxed for high d / h . for low d / h ( @xmath0 ) , no active - sterile neutrino mixing is allowed by currently popular upper limits on the primordial @xmath1he abundance @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for such low primordial d / h values , the observational inference of active - sterile neutrino mixing by upcoming solar neutrino experiments would imply that @xmath2 has been systematically underestimated , unless there is new physics not included in standard bbn .    </S>",
    "<S> upper limits on the abundance of @xmath1he produced in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) have been used to limit mixing between active ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 ) and sterile ( @xmath6 , no standard model interactions ) neutrinos @xcite . in this paper , we point out and discuss how these constraints are dependant on the adopted primordial deuterium abundance . </S>",
    "<S> previous limits on sterile neutrino mixing have assumed a value for the lower bound on the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath7 derived from interstellar medium and solar system measurements of deuterium ( d ) and @xmath8he , and models of chemical and galactic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements of d / h in quasar absorption systems ( qas ) have yielded discordant values of this ratio , some higher than previously derived ranges @xcite , and some lower @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several factors make an investigation of the primordial d / h dependance of bbn constraints on active - sterile neutrino mixing timely : the discordant qas measurements of d / h ; the fact that future solar neutrino experiments may be able to distinguish and identify @xmath9 mixing @xcite ; and the use of sterile neutrinos in schemes for neutrino masses and mixings that explain all available data @xcite .    as is well known ( _ e.g. _ , ref </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , the abundance of @xmath1he produced by bbn is essentially determined by the ratio of neutron to proton number densities ( n / p ) at `` weak freeze - out '' ( wfo ) . </S>",
    "<S> wfo occurs when the reactions that interchange neutrons and protons proceed too slowly relative to the expansion rate of the universe to keep n / p at its equilibrium value of n / p @xmath10 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 mev is the neutron - proton mass difference , and @xmath12 is the photon temperature . mixing between active and sterile neutrinos increases ( n / p)@xmath13 , and therefore the primordial @xmath1he mass fraction @xmath2 , in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , active - sterile neutrino mixing effectively brings more degrees of freedom into thermal contact , increasing the energy density and hence the expansion rate of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> second , active - sterile mixing  especially @xmath9 mixing  depletes the electron neutrino and antineutrino populations , reducing the rates of the n @xmath14 p interconversion reactions . </S>",
    "<S> both of these effects cause n / p to freeze out at a lower temperature .    using a neutrino ensemble evolution formalism @xcite that includes both neutrino oscillations ( with matter effects ) and neutrino collisions , previous authors </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have produced exclusion plots in the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane for both @xmath9 and @xmath17 mixing @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the difference of the squares of the neutrino vacuum mass eigenvalues and a measure of the vacuum mixing angle , respectively , associated with two - flavor neutrino mixing . </S>",
    "<S> these studies showed that for @xmath18 , both the @xmath17 solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem @xcite and the @xmath9 large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite are excluded for @xmath19 .    in our study of the primordial d / h dependance of bbn constraints on active - sterile neutrino mixing , </S>",
    "<S> we have employed the same neutrino evolution formalism @xcite as previous authors . </S>",
    "<S> we have neglected any net lepton number contributed by the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> ( the recently reported effect of active - sterile neutrino mixing _ generating _ net lepton number does not occur in the regions of parameter space we consider here @xcite . ) in this case , the neutrino and antineutrino sectors evolve identically . </S>",
    "<S> a fermi - dirac momentum distribution for all neutrinos is assumed , but allowance is made for non - equilibrium number densities . </S>",
    "<S> the differential equations in the formalism yield @xmath20 , and @xmath12 as functions of time . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 denotes the fraction of a full fermionic degree of freedom contributed by neutrino species @xmath22 , which we shall hereafter call the `` number density parameter '' of neutrino species @xmath22 . in the equations below we will take @xmath23 , since we are working under the assumption that the net lepton number contributed by the neutrinos is negligible .    in our bbn computation </S>",
    "<S> we have employed the kawano @xcite update of the wagoner @xcite code , with the latest world average neutron lifetime , @xmath24 s @xcite ; the reaction rates of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; and a correction of @xmath25 to @xmath2 due to finite nucleon mass and timestep - dependant effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have altered the kawano code to use the ` temperature series ' of neutrino number density parameters , @xmath26 , to compute the energy density contributed by neutrinos and the n @xmath14 p interconversion rates . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino energy density is @xmath27 the n @xmath14 p rates are @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 in these expressions @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the total electron ( or positron ) energy and rest mass , respectively ; @xmath37 ; @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the appropriate neutrino temperature ; @xmath40 ; and @xmath41 is a constant obtained by solving the equation @xmath42 for @xmath41 , where @xmath43 is the experimentally measured neutron lifetime .    </S>",
    "<S> the lower limit on @xmath7 obtained from a standard bbn calculation with @xmath44 is not appropriate for bbn with active - sterile mixing . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the lower limit on @xmath7 depends on the expansion rate , often codified as an effective number of neutrino generations @xmath45 @xcite . since active - sterile mixing increases @xmath45 ( at least for the range of parameter space we consider here @xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> it affects the lower bound on @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will plot our results as a function of the primordial d / h value  the experimentally determined quantity  rather than as a function of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations are most important for the @xmath17 atmospheric neutrino mixing solution , and much less important ( nearly negligible ) for the @xmath9 small - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , a representative @xmath17 atmospheric neutrino mixing solution ( @xmath46 ev@xmath47 , @xmath48 @xcite ) is _ assumed _ , and the resulting bbn @xmath1he yield is plotted as a function of the bbn d / h yield . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath7 ( given as @xmath49 ) at various values of d / h is also indicated on the figure . for a given value of d / h </S>",
    "<S> , the implied abundance of @xmath1he can be interpreted as the observational upper limit required to constrain the solution . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a _ detection _ of these neutrino mixing parameters by , for example , future atmospheric neutrino experiments would yield an independent determination of the primordial @xmath1he abundance , so long as d / h were known from qas studies . </S>",
    "<S> this could be very interesting , given the recent emphasis on the systematic uncertainties in the determination of the primordial @xmath1he abundance as derived from helium recombination lines in extragalactic hii regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions reached from fig . 1 are essentially the same over the range of @xmath15 ( @xmath50 ev@xmath47 ) for the proposed @xmath17 mixing explanation of the atmospheric neutrino problem .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 is similar to fig . 1 , but with a representative @xmath9 small - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem assumed ( @xmath51 ev@xmath47 , @xmath52 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these mixing parameters have only a very small effect on the bbn @xmath1he yield . for the most recent data from solar neutrino experiments and the standard solar model @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> there is no @xmath9 large - angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some of the qas data suggest d / h @xmath53 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1 - 2 show the range d / h @xmath54 , as determined in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this range of d / h implies a lower bound on @xmath7 that is significantly lower than that used in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> since a lower @xmath7 implies a lower @xmath1he yield , high d / h relaxes constraints on any effect that increases the expansion rate , including mixing with sterile species @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows , however , that for d / h @xmath53 , the @xmath17 atmospheric neutrino solution is still somewhat constrained @xcite if current observational inferences @xcite of primordial @xmath1he are correct : @xmath55 , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic . </S>",
    "<S> of course , if this @xmath17 atmospheric neutrino mixing solution were inferred from atmospheric neutrino experiments , and qas studies confirm d / h @xmath53 , the implied @xmath1he abundance of @xmath56 would be significantly higher than the central value of @xmath57 cited above .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 small - angle msw solar neutrino solution is allowed for d / h @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows that an observational upper bound of @xmath58 would be required to restrict this small angle solution if such a high d / h is indeed the primordial value .    </S>",
    "<S> other very high quality qas data  arguably better @xcite for the determination of d / h than that used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  suggest d / h @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this value of d / h is incompatible with standard bbn with @xmath44 @xcite for current observational inferences of the primordial @xmath1he abundances @xcite , and any mixing with sterile neutrinos would only exacerbate the problem . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned previously , however , it has been argued that @xmath2 has been systematically underestimated , and a more appropriate upper limit on @xmath2 may actually be @xmath59 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is unlikely that the systematic error in @xmath2 is enough to allow the @xmath17 atmospheric neutrino solution for d / h @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , observation of the @xmath9 small - angle msw solar neutrino solution , together with a solid determination of d / h @xmath0 , would require that @xmath2 has been systematically and significantly underestimated by about @xmath60 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , unless there is non - standard physics during the bbn epoch @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a somewhat trivial point , since the mixing parameters of the small - angle @xmath9 msw solution produce only very slightly more @xmath1he than the standard bbn picture with @xmath44 , for which the `` crisis '' at low d / h is well - known @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> useful constraints on the @xmath9 small - angle msw solar neutrino solution would require very precise observational knowledge of @xmath7 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this may , however , still be interesting in view of the fact that future solar neutrino experiments may be able to distinguish the sterile neutrino oscillation - based solution from other solutions @xcite . also , many models that seek to satisfy all available constraints on neutrino properties employ the @xmath9 small - angle msw solar neutrino solution @xcite ( but see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>"
