    "based on the cold dark matter theory , the models of `` hierarchical formation '' give a step - wise process in which small objects merge , inducing bursts of star formation that create different types of massive and bright galaxies which we see today @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the monolithic models suggest a top - down formation scenario assuming that stars form through a direct collapse of a large gas cloud , and flatten over time as the gas cools @xcite .    according to hierarchical galaxy formation models ,",
    "galactic sizes should grow with time , and massive disk galaxies were formed at @xmath10 @xcite . to place tight constraints on the galaxy formation scenario , observational studies of high redshift galaxies on the size , morphology , stellar mass and age et al .",
    "have been carried out over the past decade @xcite .",
    "studies of the galaxy size evolution at high redshift ( @xmath11 ) from the great observatories origins deep survey(goods ) , as well as ultra deep field ( udf ) and udf - parallel advanced camera for surveys fields showed a clear decrease in size from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and a possible extension to @xmath14 , indicating that high redshift galaxies are compact in size ( @xmath15 ) and that large ( @xmath16 ) low surface brightness galaxies are rare @xcite . on the other hand , observational evidences of massive disk galaxies at redshift much beyond one has become considerably abundant in literatures recently @xcite .",
    "the most direct edvidences for the existence of large disks at high redshift are usually from the deep near - infrared imaging of high redshift qso field , clusters and hubble deep field - south @xcite .",
    "this is probably because previous u - dropout technique revealed only the unobscured star forming regions rather than the more evolved underlying population that forms the disk , and multiwavelength surveys with high quality photometry are suggested for an unbiased census of massive galaxies in the early universe @xcite .    in this paper , we present the results from @xmath0 broad - band deep images of the qso 1508 + 5714 field ( @xmath17 ) , as well as the analysis of the rest frame uv / optical morphology and the sed of a b - dropout galaxy nearby qso .",
    "in addition , the low dispersion spectrum of the qso , showing clearly the strong and sharp lyman  @xmath18and @xmath19 emission lines , as well as a lyman limit system at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , corresponding to a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath22 ) @xcite . a possible connection between the lyman limit absorption and the galaxy would be discussed in the next paper .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are adopted throughout .",
    "the @xmath25 deep imaging of the qso1508 + 5714 field was made on may 28 , 2001(ut ) during a test run , using the focas camera on subaru 8.2 m telescope at mauna kea .",
    "the camera is made of two @xmath26 ccds and a pixel scale of @xmath27 , providing a field size of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we adopted in the observation a binned mode to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath29 .",
    "the total exposure times were 2800 , 1500 and 1700 seconds for @xmath30(@xmath31 ) , @xmath32(@xmath33 ) and @xmath34(@xmath35 ) respectively .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the iraf package .",
    "after bias subtraction , each frame was subsequently flat - fielded using a combination of dome flats or twilight sky flats to remove pixel - to - pixel variations across the ccd chips .",
    "we perform sky background subtraction by removing a 2nd - order polynomial fitted to the sky components .",
    "finally , the dithered frames within each bandpass were averaged using an outlier rejection algorithm . the weather was clear and the observational condition was good .",
    "the final combined image has a stellar psf with full width at half maximum ( fwhm)@xmath36 in the @xmath32 band .    in order to constrain the redshift range of the detected galaxies",
    ", we obtained a one hour deep - b exposure by service observing mode on july 14 , 2007(ut ) with the subaru suprime camera , which is a mosaic of ten @xmath37 ccds and covers a @xmath38 field of view with a pixel scale of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the final combined image has a stellar psf with full width at half maximum ( fwhm)@xmath36 .",

    "we use data reduction packages `` sdfred '' for the suprime - cam image @xcite , as well as the package `` mcsred '' developed by ichi tanaka ( 2008 ) for the moircs data , to reduce the raw data and produce the scientific images for further photometry .",
    "the weather was clear and we have gotten a stellar psf with full width at half maximum ( fwhm)@xmath48 in the @xmath44 band for the final combined image .",
    "we retrieved from the hst data archive a 4800 seconds exposure taken by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) wfpc2 in the f814w - band ( approximately @xmath34 band , and a pixel scale of @xmath49 ) .",
    "considering the high resolution of the hst image , we will rely on it for the morphological analysis of the galaxy candidates .",
    "for the current study , we have performed : i ) careful psf subtraction on the combined images of all bandpasses , to reduce the effects of qso light .",
    "the modeled psf was determined using a set of bright stars in the same image with daophot ; ii ) because our image is more sensitive in the @xmath32 than in the @xmath34 band , the object detection was done by running the sextractor package on the combined and psf subtracted image in the @xmath32-band , and a detection threshold of @xmath50 of the skylevel was adopted ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "colors were determined by re - running sextractor in the double - image mode , in which the faint objects detected on the `` detection image''(in the @xmath32-band ) were measured with the same aperture in the registered other bands .",
    "the photometric results are shown in tab.[tab : color1 ] and tab.[tab : color2 ] , where the data with footnote @xmath51 for galaxy `` g1 '' and `` g2 '' are measured with a small diameter aperture ( @xmath52 ) using sextractor and those with footnote @xmath53 are measured with a large diameter aperture ( @xmath54 ) using sextractor .",
    "also observed were several standard stars selected from landolt ( 1992 ) for @xmath55 bands on the same night and at similar airmasses .",
    "the standard star fs27 was observed as the photometric calibrator for @xmath56 bands , which was selected from hunt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the 2mass all - sky catalogue of point sources .",
    "we have adopted the equation b(ab)=b-0.11 , v(ab)=v+0.02 , r(ab)=r+0.20 , i(ab)=i+0.45 , j(ab)=j+0.9 , h(ab)=h+1.38 , ks(ab)=ks+1.86 , to put the magnitude onto the ab system @xcite .",

    "two objects standout in the images of @xmath55 bands , within a distance of @xmath2 northwest and southeast of the qso line of sight , which are designated as `` g1 '' and `` g2 '' in this work .",
    "galaxy `` g1 '' is marked by blue circles in the images , and `` g2 '' is marked by green circles in the images of @xmath55 bands .",
    "galaxy `` g2 '' is not detected in the nir images .",
    "firstly , we adopt the v - dropout selection criteria designed by fukugita et al.(2004 ) to select galaxies at @xmath58 , who use the same set of filters as ours to select galaxies at @xmath59 . @xmath60",
    "the colors of galaxies `` g1 '' and `` g2 '' , with small diameter aperture ( @xmath52 ) and large diameter aperture ( @xmath54 ) , are shown in tab.[tab : color2 ] .",
    "considering the peculiar colors of galaxy `` g1 '' with @xmath61 , we tentatively suggest that it is most likely a candidate galaxy at redshift @xmath59 , and might be responsible for the lyman limit absorption at @xmath20 seen in the qso spectrum .    however , we understand that the @xmath25 filter set is not ideal for two - color photometric selection of galaxies at @xmath59 , according to various model calculations @xcite .",
    "this is because an evolved galaxy at @xmath62 is likely to have similar colors to the high redshift object owing to the presence of the @xmath63 break .",
    "we therefore made deep b - imaging of the field centered on qso1508 + 5714 with the suprime camera on subaru telescope to constrain the redshift range of galaxies `` g1 '' and `` g2 '' .",
    "with one hour exposure , we clearly detected galaxy `` g2 '' , with a detection threshold of @xmath64 over the sky level .",
    "however , galaxy `` g1 '' is much fainter , and gives a @xmath65 detection of @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the spectrum properties of galaxy `` g1 '' do show the lyman break , and indicates that galaxy `` g1 '' might be a high redshift galaxy at @xmath59 . comparing with the bri color selection for @xmath59 lbgs given by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we found that the colors of galaxy `` g1 '' satisfy their criteria , but not for galaxy `` g2 '' .",
    "@xmath67    although we can not completely exclude the possibility that galaxy `` g2 '' is also at high - z with @xmath68 , we suspect that it is most likely a foreground contaminator .",
    "the reasons are as following : 1)considering the surface density of lyman break galaxies at @xmath59 , down to magnitude @xmath69 ( @xmath70 per square arcmin ) , the probability of finding two objects at such high redshift and within such a small area ( @xmath57 15square ) is very low ; 2)meanwhile , inferred from the presence of only one absorption line system in the qso spectrum @xcite , we suspect that most likely only galaxy `` g1 '' is a high - z object .",
    ".photometric results 1 .",
    "the footnotes a and b for `` g1 '' and `` g2 '' indicate the measurements with small and large apertures described in detail in sec .",
    "2 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we used the public code ( hyperz ) to obtain the photometric redshift for the galaxy candidate , @xmath71 .",
    "this code uses sed fitting through a standard @xmath72 minimization procedure .",
    "the photometric uncertainties in the @xmath0 fluxes of the object are accounted for and the fluxes are compared with a set of template spectra . for a complete description of the code and the accuracy of its results , we refer the readers to bolzonella et al.(2000 ) .",
    "we adopted a full range of solar metallicity stellar population models , including models matching the sequence of colors from e - s0 to sd , as well as a single starburst model , which was built by the bruzual & charlot evolutionary code ( bc03 , bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the template seds were reddened by applying the calzetti reddening law with a wide range of reddening values from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , with steps of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure allowed redshifts in the range of @xmath76 .",
    "[ sed ] shows the best fit sed for galaxy `` g1 '' from our multi - band photometry , which is a @xmath77 myr old young starburst at @xmath5 with a@xmath78mag , giving a fitting result of @xmath79 and the corresponding probablity of @xmath80 . the estimated error on",
    "the redshift is 0.05(0.11 ) at @xmath81(@xmath82 ) confidence level .",
    "the nir color of galaxy `` g1 '' ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) indicates that galaxy `` g1 '' is slightly bluer than the distant red galaxies ( drgs ) at @xmath85 , which would have a strong balmer/4000break .",
    "the stellar mass of galaxy `` g1 '' is estimated from the multi - band photometry sed fitting .",
    "we get a value of @xmath86 , which is consistent with the relation between stellar mass and observed total @xmath87 magnitude for galaxies at @xmath88 in the fires , goods and musyc fields , given by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "galaxy `` g2 '' is not detected in the @xmath56 bands .",
    "we will not include its fitting result here , due to the poor accuracy of the photometric redshift calculation .",
    "even for galaxy `` g1 '' , we understand that the low detection limits in @xmath89 bands ( @xmath90 ) would affect the precision of the photometric redshift estimation .",
    "this is because it would cause relatively `` flat '' probability function due to a lack of sufficient photometric information . for detailed scientific research , further spectroscopy to confirm the redshift of the candidates",
    "is strongly required .",
    "to study the morphologies and sizes of both detected objects , we estimated their structural parameters by running a 2-d fitting algorithm galfit @xcite on the hst wfpc2 archive image in the f814w filter .",
    "we also show a montage figures of galaxy `` g1 '' in fig.[montage ] , to confirm the disk morphology in other bands .",
    "we used the public software tiny - tim to create a psf for the convolution of the hst wfpc2 image , and made a model fitting to the qso field where the qso ( psf ) and the two galaxies `` g1 '' and `` g2''(s@xmath6rsic profiles ) are fitted simultaneously to deblend everything together , and to reduce the contaminating flux from the wings in the psf of the qso .",
    "haeussler et al.(2007 ) shows that this kind of simultaneous fitting gives the most reliable results against the neighboring contamination , especially in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields .",
    "this is because the simultaneous fit of the profiles of multiple companions thereby deblends their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest .",
    "the output images from galfit are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : block ] , which shows from left to right , the original image specified by the convolution box size , the final model of the objects in the selected field and the residual image by subtracting the second from the first image .",
    "the surface brightness radial profiles of galaxy `` g1 '' is shown in fig.[fig : prf.g1 ] , which is measured by fitting ellipses to the wfpc2 images with the stsdas task ellipse .    for galaxy",
    "`` g1 '' , the best fit structural parameters are @xmath91 , the s@xmath6rsic index @xmath92 , and an effective radius @xmath93 .",
    "in addition , we have done several checks of the systematics , such as , by masking out the central region of the qso which can not be fitted well , and running again the simultaneous model fitting to the qso field .",
    "we found that there is no significant systematic errors for the current results , especially for the s@xmath6rsic index .",
    "however , the wfpc2/f814 image maps the unobscured star - forming regions at rest frame uv wavelengths , it would not be appropriate for discussing the radial profile or morphology of the galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , moircs ks - band imaging is looking at the rest - optical wavelength which has a stellar psf with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath48 for the combined image .",
    "we understand that the parameters of the s@xmath6rsic profiles would be affected by seeing . in case of a @xmath48 ( fwhm ) resolution",
    ", we hope to see at least the radial profile in the outer region .",
    "so , the seeing - limited ground - based ks imaging would be a good complement to the wfpc2/f814 results for the morphological studies .",
    "similar as we have done for the wfpc2 f814 image , we made a galfit fitting to the ks image by convolving a psf to the models .",
    "the psf image for convolution is created by fitting a nearby bright star with a number of s@xmath6rsic profiles .",
    "the surface brightness radial profile of galaxy `` g1 '' is shown in fig.[fig : prf.k.g1 ] , which is measured by fitting ellipses to the wfpc2 images with the stsdas task ellipse .",
    "the overplotted lines are the best - fit exponential and @xmath94 laws from galfit fitting .",
    "the measured angular size corresponds to a physical radii of @xmath95 at @xmath5 . according to the relationship between the s@xmath6rsic index ( @xmath96 ) and the morphological type",
    ", we propose that galaxy `` g1 '' is most probably a large disk galaxy at high - z @xcite .",
    "the studies of the size and morphology of distant objects have been carried out by several authors , and the detections of large disk galaxies at high redshift have been accumulating @xcite .",
    "recently , a few large disk systems at @xmath97 , with @xmath98 are reported by stockton et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and akiyama et al .",
    "if the redshift of galaxy `` g1 '' could be confirmed , it would give evidence for the existence of such large disks at even higher redshift , which might be the progenitors of the similar systems detected by stockton et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and akiyama et al .",
    "considering that most of the large disks detected by other groups are old galaxies , galaxy `` g1 '' has a bluer color , and a young `` dusty '' starburst spectrum .",
    "this provides strong evidence for a large disk formation in the early universe with on - going star formation .",
    "meanwhile , the presence of such a population at high redshift would require the current galaxy formation models to allow for the presence of early - forming massive disks .",
    "we have presented an analysis of deep images in the @xmath0 bands centered on qso 1508 + 5714 at @xmath99 , which is known to contain a lyman limit system at @xmath100 seen in the qso spectrum .    a b - dropout galaxy `` g1 '' which is about @xmath2 northwest of the qso sightline is clearly detected . to complement the color selection ,",
    "a photometric redshift analysis is presented and gives a value of @xmath101 .",
    "we estimate its projected distance of @xmath102 at @xmath103 , and further derive the absolute magnitude @xmath104 , making it about @xmath105 for a star - forming galaxy spectrum .",
    "the stellar mass of galaxy `` g1 '' is estimated from the multi - band photometry sed fitting method .",
    "we get a value of @xmath106 , consistent with the relation between stellar mass and observed total @xmath87 magnitude for galaxies at @xmath88 in the fires , goods and musyc fields , given by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "we have run a 2-d imaging decomposition on the hst wfpc2 archive image of the qso nearby field by galfit , which gives a s@xmath6rsic index ( @xmath107 ) for galaxy `` g1 '' , indicating a possible late - type morphology according to the s@xmath6rsic index  morphological type relation .",
    "the radial profile of the seeing - limited ground - based ks image is shown as a complement to the wfpc2/f814 results ( rest frame uv wavelengths ) for the morphological studies , since it is looking at the rest - optical wavelength .",
    "we can see in fig.6 the radial profile can be well described by exponential curve at least at the larger radii ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "if galaxy `` g1 '' is placed at @xmath103 , we derive its effective radius ( @xmath109 ) , with the wmap cosmology adopted by this study .",
    "given the small impact parameter , the peculiar colors , the estimation of the photometric redshift , as well as various lines of evidence discussed in the previous sections , we suspect that galaxy `` g1 '' is most likely to be a massive disk at high redshift , and might give rise to the known lls ( @xmath100 ) seen in the qso spectrum .",
    "such a large disk galaxy at high redshift would have a strong impact on the galaxy formation theory , if the redshift of galaxy `` g1 '' could be confirmed .",
