    "latest theoretical studies @xcite showed that simple coarse - grained models can provide reasonable estimates for those quantities .    in recent experimental works",

    "single molecule force measurements allow the distance @xmath5 between the native and the first transition state ( ts1 ) and the distance @xmath6 between the intermediate state ( is ) and the second transition state ( ts2 ) to be evaluated .",
    "the unfolding barriers @xmath7 and @xmath8 can also be determined .",
    "as far as we know , there were no theoretical attempts to calculate these important parameters .",
    "therefore , the goal of this work is to develop a new method for computing them from simulations . using the go model @xcite and our new method",
    ", we calculated the free energy landscape parameters for the three - state titin domain i27 and the domain ddfln4 .",
    "our results are in reasonable agreement with the experiments @xcite .",
    "the new method is based on the fact that the end - to - end extension , @xmath0 , is a good reaction coordinate for describing mechanical unfolding .",
    "it should be noted that the direction of the force and therefore @xmath0 is changing upon partial unfolding of a protein .",
    "the time @xmath9 for a molecule to go from the ns to the is is defined as a time needed to achieve the intermediate point @xmath1 between the ts1 and ts2 ( fig .",

    "using the force dependencies of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the bell formula @xcite , we can extract @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the unfolding barriers @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be estimated in the framework of the microscopic kinetic theory @xcite .    to illustrate our method",
    ", we used the go model @xcite , which is an appropriate choice not only because the construction of fel for long enough biomolecules by all - atom models is beyond present computational facilities , but also because unfolding of biomolecules is mainly governed by the native conformation topology @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown @xcite that the go model provides reasonable estimates for @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the two - state approximation and is expected to be applicable to three - state molecules .",
    "details of the go model are given in our previous works @xcite .",
    "we use the same set of parameters as for go modeling of ubiquitin @xcite .",
    "the main computations were carried out at @xmath13 k @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath16 is the hydrogen bond energy .",

    "for the water viscosity , one can neglect the inertia term and use the euler method with the time step @xmath22 to solve the corresponding langevin equation .    since native titin is a highly heterogeneous polymer , in experiments , one used a poly - protein composed of identical tandem repeats of the ig module ( i27@xmath23 @xcite ) to study elastic properties of a single domain at high solution . in the ddfln4 case",
    ", a single ddfln4 domain is sandwiched between ig domains i27 - 30 and domains i31 - 34 from titin @xcite .",
    "unfolding of ddfln4 can be easily studied , as its mechanical stability is much lower than that of ig - domains ( ddfln4 would have lower peaks in the force - extension curve ) . in afm experiments , one end of a poly - protein",
    "is anchored to a surface and the another end to a tip of a very soft cantilever .",
    "the molecule is stretched by increasing the distance between the surface and the cantilever as the external force acts on one of termini via the tip . because a poly - protein mechanically unfolds domain by domain",
    ", one can consider that one end of a single domain is anchored and the force is applied to the another one .",
    "therefore , as in all - atom steered molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , when the force is ramped linearly with time , we fix the n - terminal and pull the c - terminal by applying a force @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the displacement of the pulled atom from its original position @xcite , and the spring constant @xmath26 is set to be the same as in the harmonic term of the potential energy for the studied system @xcite .",
    "the pulling direction was chosen along the vector directed from the fixed atom to the pulled one .",
    "the pulling speed was set equal to @xmath27 nm / s , which is about 3 - 4 orders of magnitude faster than those used in experiments . in the constant force simulations ,",
    "we add the term @xmath28 to the total energy of the system , where @xmath29 is the end - to - end distance , and @xmath30 the force applied to the both termini .",

    "the unfolding time @xmath10 is an average of the first passage times needed for the molecule to achieve the rod state starting from the extension @xmath1 . in order to get a reasonable estimate for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "we have generated 30 - 50 trajectories for each value of @xmath30 .",
