    "the orientational ordering of @xmath16 tetrahedra drives a rich sequence of structural phases in ionic @xmath2 compounds of @xmath4 type . in the present communication",
    "we are interested in the nature of the phase transition from the parent high - symmetry phase @xmath17 ( like @xmath18-@xmath4 ) to the orthorhombic phase @xmath1 ( like @xmath19-@xmath4 ) that occurs at high temperatures ( @xmath20 ) either directly : @xmath21 ( e.g. in @xmath4 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) or via an intermediate @xmath24incommensurate ( @xmath25 ) phase :    @xmath26    as in molybdates and tungstates @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the last one has the modulation vector @xmath27 that can be alternatively directed in two other equivalent directions of the @xmath28 star of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "all the transitions are of the order - disorder type and are characterized by the vertical ( up / down ) orientations of @xmath16 tetrahedra .",
    "other , low temperature transitions in @xmath29 compounds that are related with the planar orientation of tetrahedra are beyond our consideration ( for details , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    from the viewpoint of the landau theory of phase transitions ,",
    "only the lock - in @xmath30 transition should be of the first order .",
    "the @xmath5 transition should be of the second order since @xmath1 is a subgroup of @xmath0 and in the landau functional neither third order nor lifshits terms are present .",
    "the transition @xmath31 should also be of the second order as a transition to the incommensurate phase of the type ii .",
    "the recently proposed hcp ising model @xcite correctly describes the high - temperature phase diagram of @xmath2 compounds . in this model",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath31 transitions are of the second order .",
    "the experimental properties of @xmath32the @xmath5 transitions in various compounds of @xmath2 family are collected from refs.@xcite in table i as function of the geometrical factor @xmath3 of their hcp structure . as was shown in our previous study @xcite this",
    "is the unique parameter that drives the actual phase sequence : for @xmath33 the transition is direct , whereas for @xmath34 the sequence ( [ inc ] ) takes place .    in disagreement with the theoretical prediction ,",
    "the direct @xmath5 transition is of the first order with a large jump of the molar entropy ( @xmath6 ) @xcite and of the lattice constants ( @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "the incommensurate phase in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 was relatively poorly studied because of the high hygroscopic nature of these compounds @xcite .",
    "it is known that the @xmath31 transition reveals a substantial discontinuity of the lattice parameter ( @xmath36 ) @xcite . to characterize the thermodynamics of the @xmath12 transition we performed differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) measurements in @xmath7 that are reported in sec .",
    "it was found that both transitions are of the first order with entropy jumps of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 transition is a rare example of incommensurate transition that occurs discontinuously .    at @xmath40 the critical temperatures @xmath41 , @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath43 coincide and the @xmath2 compounds seem to reveal a triple lifshitz point , that was found previously only in few experimental systems ( for a review see ref .",
    "the particular property of this lifshitz point in @xmath2 compounds is that all the incoming transition lines are of the first order .",
    "this possibility was theoretically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where the discontinuities were modeled by the negative forth - order terms in the landau functional . to our knowledge",
    "this is also the unique example of lifshitz point in a system where the modulation vector can be directed in more than one equivalent direction .",
    "the main question raised by these systems is why strong discontinuities at @xmath5 and @xmath31 transitions appear .",
    "note first that they can not be ascribed to fluctuation effects that were widely studied last decades in relation with transitions to the modulated phases @xcite .",
    "in such a case the first order character is attributed to the lack of a stable fixed point as in @xmath44 @xcite and the discontinuity is expected to be small due to the smallness of the critical region .",
    "we propose that the observed discontinuities are caused by the coupling of the order parameter with elasticity of the crystal that is known @xcite to be able to change the order of transition .",
    "introducing in sec .",
    "iii the corresponding coupling to the mean - field treatment of the hcp ising model @xcite and comparing the results with the measured jumps of the lattice constant and molar entropy we demonstrate that this coupling can be responsible for the transitions discontinuity .",
    "dsc experiments were performed in @xmath7 crystals to characterize the thermodynamics of the @xmath12 transitions . due to the very high hygroscopic nature of the material ,",
    "powder samples were prepared in a special camera in a dry nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "dsc experiments have been performed using a mettler - ta3000 equipment , between room temperature and @xmath45 .",
    "the heating / cooling rate was @xmath46 .",
    "dsc thermograms of the investigated sample show the presence of two reversible enthalpic anomalies at about @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the lock - in and the incommensurate phase transitions , respectively ( see fig .",
    "the measured molar entropy jumps are @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( approximately @xmath51 of @xmath52 are taken from the @xmath53peak of dsc anomaly at @xmath42 and other @xmath54 from the residual specific heat decrease in the temperature interval of about @xmath55 below @xmath42 , see fig .",
    "these values are given in the table i in units of @xmath56 .",
    "an hysteresis of @xmath57 was observed for the @xmath30 transition , ( @xmath58 for heating and @xmath59 for cooling ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath31 transition reveals no hysteresis within the error bar of @xmath60 .",
    "this is consistent with extremely small hysteresis of @xmath61 observed for @xmath5 transition in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature order - disorder transitions in @xmath62 compounds are described by the in - site averages of the vertical orientation of @xmath16 tetrahedra , @xmath63 where the pseudo - spin @xmath64 is equal to @xmath65 for the up / down tetrahedra orientations @xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath66 are equal to zero in the disordered high - temperature phase @xmath0 . in the low - temperature phase @xmath1 , they take the equal amplitudes @xmath67 and alternate according to @xmath1 symmetry . in the incommensurate phase a modulation @xmath68 occurs .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath69 , and hence of amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( that define the corresponding order parameters ) , are smaller than one ; the less they are , the more @xmath16 tetrahedra are disordered . because of the discontinuity of the @xmath5 and @xmath72 transitions the amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath73 have nonvanishing values below the critical temperatures @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "we estimate @xmath74 and @xmath73 in the ordered states from the entropy jump at the transition :      that is measured experimentally ( see table i ) . for @xmath23 and @xmath76 , the inequality @xmath77 holds , which means that in the low temperature phase the @xmath16 tetrahedra are perfectly ordered ( @xmath78 ) and , possibly , other degrees of freedom are involved in the transition . taking @xmath69 in the incommensurate phase of @xmath79 as @xmath80 , from @xmath81 we get @xmath82 that again demonstrates the high degree of tetrahedra ordering",
    ".    in the mean - field approach of the hcp ising model @xcite ,",
    "the phase transitions from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and to @xmath25 phases were found to be continuous and the free energy ( per molecule ) was expanded over the small values of parameters @xmath70 and @xmath73 as :            the critical temperatures @xmath43 , @xmath42 are functions of interaction parameters @xmath85 .",
    "they coincide at the lifshitz point and are correlated with the geometrical factor @xmath3 as follows : @xmath86 when @xmath87 and @xmath88 when @xmath89 .    to account for the discontinuity of the transitions we propose that coupling of tetrahedra orientation with crystal elasticity is responsible for this phenomenon .",
    "our further consideration is analogous to compressible ising model , proposed by domb @xcite . for estimation purpose",
    "we consider here only the coupling with the strain @xmath90 along the hexagonal axis and omit other elastic degrees of freedom .",
    "account of those is difficult because of the absence of experimental data , but it can only improve our estimations .",
    "the elastic contribution to the free energy is written as : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the coupling of the order parameter with elastic strain and @xmath93 is the proper elastic energy of the crystal ( per unit volume @xmath94 of the molecule ) .",
    "after minimization we get the strain in the @xmath1 phase : @xmath95 . substituting it back to ( [ felcom ] )",
    "we find that coupling with elastic strain renormalizes the quartic term in ( [ fcom ] ) and the total free energy is written as :      the quartic term becomes negative when the elastic contribution @xmath97 exceeds the ising thermal energy @xmath98 .",
    "the transition then is of the first order and the amplitude of @xmath1 order parameter is stabilized by the higher order terms .",
    "we estimate the value of the coupling constant @xmath99 from the relation @xmath100 = @xmath101 that , in @xmath102 with @xmath103 @xcite , @xmath104 @xmath105 @xcite and @xmath106 gives @xmath107 .",
    "then , the elastic contribution @xmath108 is indeed larger than @xmath109 that justifies the role of the elastic degrees of freedom in the discontinuity of @xmath5 transition .",
    "we perform the estimation of the quartic coefficient for @xmath7 in an analogous way as the precedent , taking @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "since the elastic constant @xmath115 is not available we assume it has the same value as in @xmath4 .",
    "the jump of the lattice parameter @xmath116 is assumed to be of the same order of @xmath117 as in @xmath8 .",
    "the calculation gives : @xmath118 and @xmath119 that again is larger than the bare forth - order coefficient @xmath120 .    to conclude , we suggest that the lifshitz point occurs in @xmath121 compounds at @xmath40 where three first - order transition lines meet together .",
    "one can expect to achieve this point experimentally , either by preparation of solid solution @xmath122 or by submitting @xmath23 or @xmath123 ( with @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) to an uniaxial pressure along @xmath126 . analyzing experimental data",
    "we demonstrate that the coupling of the order parameter with crystal elasticity can be responsible for the discontinuity of transition .",
    "we stress another peculiar feature of the @xmath5 and @xmath72 transitions . despite of the strong entropy jump ( @xmath127 ) , they have a very low hysteresis ( less than @xmath61 ) that can not be explained on the basis of the available models @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath5 transition occurs also in another compound of @xmath2 family - @xmath128 that has a large ratio @xmath129 . unlike other cases",
    ", this transition is either of the second or of the weak first order with the entropy jump less then @xmath130 @xcite and with no visible jump of the lattice constants @xcite .",
    "then , it is quite probable , that the order of transition changes from the first to the second one and that the @xmath5 transition line reveals a tricritical point when @xmath3 increases .",
    "more systematic experiments however are needed to verify this hypothesis .",
