    "planar two - dimensional graphene has been considered to be a very promising new material since its preparation by novoselov _",
    "et al._@xcite and berger _ et al._@xcite in 2004 .",
    "recent interest is focused on the appearance of magnetism around point defects in graphene@xcite and the possibility of hydrogen storage@xcite . a global understanding of the origin of magnetism in finite graphene systems is provided by lieb s theorem on bipartite lattices@xcite .",
    "any unbalance between the numbers of sites belonging to each of the two sublattices gives rise to a magnetic groundstate@xcite .",
    "this result rests on the validity of a simple hubbard hamiltonian which certainly works for the semi - quantitative description of the spin states of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules but not for the corresponding charged states@xcite .",
    "the saturation of a carbon @xmath0-electron by hydrogen is one of the simplest ways to change the balance between sublattice sites and , consequently , it produces spin polarization in the neighborhood .",
    "this provides an interesting link between hydrogenation and spin production that motivates this work .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the 1/2 spin originated by the presence of an isolated hydrogen atom on top of a carbon atom belonging to planar graphene can be quenched if an extra electron bounds to the defect . numerical results obtained by _ ab initio _ open - shell density functional methods ( dft ) suggest that the complex defect is energetically favorable .",
    "a similar spin quenching phenomenon was discussed some years ago by duplock , scheffler , and lindan for hydrogen near a stone - wales defect@xcite .",
    "these authors have shown that the spin polarized groundstate around chemisorbed hydrogen disappears in the presence of a stone - wales defect . in their interpretation , this result is probably due to the strong destruction of alternation near the defect that eliminates the tendency to antiferromagnetic order . in our case , however , we argue that the mere flow of charge is enough to heal the local unbalance between sublattices due to the existence of one chemisorbed hydrogen on an otherwise ideal graphene material .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the _ ab initio _ methods used in this work are presented in section ii followed by the discussion of our main numerical results .",
    "final section iii just remarks our main message .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ electronaffinities ]    let us briefly discuss the results given in table ii .",
    "the electron affinity of @xmath1 cluster , i.e. , the cluster with one hydrogen chemisorbed on top of one of the six carbon atoms on the inner ring of coronene ( see , fig .",
    "1 ) is 1.18 ev larger than the electron affinity of coronene .",
    "also , the value for @xmath2 , that is , h on top of supercoronene is 0.89 ev larger than the supercoronene electron affinity .",
    "although , only two cluster sizes have been studied , it seems that the difference is approaching a limiting value close to the electron affinity of free hydrogen , that is , close to 0.75 ev .",
    "if this were the case , the extra charge would be attracted by hydrogen with a similar strength as in free space and the screening by the rest of @xmath0-electrons of graphene would remain unnoticed .",
    "nevertheless , we show later that only part of the extra charge remains close to the defect .",
    "therefore , we assume that for an infinite system only a fraction of 0.75 ev proportional to the localized charge would remain .",
    "there is an alternative elaboration of the results given in table i focusing on the variation of the binding of a hydrogen atom on top of a charged surface compared to the binding by the neutral one . from this point of view , h binding energy increases from 0.59 ev to 1.77 ev on coronene and from 0.36 ev to 1.25 ev in supercoronene using pc2 values in table i@xcite .",
    "this means that the charged systems bind hydrogen about one ev stronger than the neutral ones .",
    "from this perspective , the larger values of the electron affinity obtained for hydrogenated clusters can be asigned to a stronger hydrogen binding to graphene .    the relative facility to move charge across the overall system implied by the semi - metallic character of graphene and our results in table ii point towards the formation of a complex point defect with an extra electron in the neighborhood of the chemisorbed hydrogen atom .",
    "this picture is further supported by the spatial distribution of this extra electron in the studied clusters as it is shown in figs .",
    "[ resta ] and  [ restasc ] .",
    "charge densities obtained with pc2 gaussian basis for coronene anion and neutral coronene have been subtracted in fig .",
    "[ resta ] using the molden package@xcite . the same difference for supercoronene",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ restasc ] .",
    "in both cases , the charge around `` on top '' h is similar to the extra charge of the h anion . on the other hand ,",
    "the spreading positive and negative densities are similar but not equal in coronene and supercoronene .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that the extra electron is occupying the partially occupied homo level of the corresponding neutral clusters .",
    "[ homosc ] gives a picture of the homo orbital of h on supercoronene that nicely explains the charge difference previously shown in fig .",
    "[ restasc ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice , however , that although the extra charge clusters around the adsorbate , it is partly delocalized as it is expected from quantum mechanics principles . in fact , from independent tight - binding calculations in periodic systems we do nt find a true _ exponential _ localization around the defect ( see appendix ) . on the contrary , a percentage of the charge is extended all over the system ( e.g. , see fig .  [ restasc ] ) .",
    "however , as our detailed quantum - mechanical calculations show , the net effect of the localized part is enough to quench the spin",
    ".    our _ ab initio _",
    "results on periodic extended systems fully support the interpretation given in the previous paragraph .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig4x4 ] how the extra charge is accumulated around the adsorbed h. in this case , bonding charges for the neutral and charged supercells are depicted in the upper and lower panels of the figure , respectively .",
    "bonding charges are defined as density charge differences between the whole system and conveniently defined fragments . in our case ,",
    "hydrogen atom is one fragment while the graphene @xmath3 supercell is the second one .",
    "the upper difference integrates to one electronic charge since the whole system is charged while the fragments are neutral .",
    "we notice that a small part of the extra electron is on carbon atoms while an important part attaches to hydrogen ( the violet negative density in the lower panel does not appears in the upper panel meaning a positive contribution to the extra charge in the upper panel ) . the same picture is extracted from a mulliken analysis of populations around different atoms . in the neutral system ,",
    "charge flows upon adsorption from hydrogen to graphene , so approximately @xmath4 e is located around hydrogen while the transferred charge resides mostly around the closest carbon behind hydrogen ( @xmath5 e ) . on the other hand , in the charged system we find @xmath6 e around hydrogen ,",
    "while the carbon behind keeps nearly the same occupation ( @xmath7 e ) and the rest of the charge is distributed over nearest neighbors and next - nearest neighbors . therefore , about 80% of the extra electron is located near the chemisorbed hydrogen . along the same line ,",
    "the h - c bond population analysis is about three times larger for the anion , although the bond length is nearly not affected .",
    "finally , integration of the spin density and the absolute value of the spin density over the simulation cell give further support for this picture . in the neutral system",
    "these values amount to @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 respectively , while in the charged one decrease to values of amount to @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath10 respectively .",
    "therefore , the accumulation of charge around the adsorbed h and the c nearest and next nearest neighbors plays the role to cancel the extra spin polarization brought by the adsorption of h on the clean graphene layer in accordance with the results obtained on finite clusters .",
    "there is a subtle chemical argument that helps the understanding of our numerical results . in ref .",
    "( ) , trivalent carbon atoms with an unpaired electron were unraveled in the studied geometry of carbon tetrapod .",
    "this carbon radicals were stabilized by steric protection giving rise to unpaired localized electrons that polarize the carbon neighborhood and explain the appearance of magnetism in pure organic systems .",
    "the original paradigm is tryphenilmethyl , synthesized by gomberg in 1900@xcite , where a trivalent carbon atom is stabilized by three bonds to benzene rings impeding the reaction with a similar molecule .",
    "nevertheless , the anion of tryphenilmethyl reacts with a proton to form a strong c - h bond ( heat of reaction amounts to 15.65 ev per molecule ) : @xmath13 producing a neutral non - magnetic molecule resembling the clusters that we have studied here@xcite .",
    "both the number of h atoms and electrons are even allowing an easy shell closing and stabilization of the resulting molecule .",
    "we can adapt the underlying chemistry of these phenomena to the binding of h on graphene using the following argument : it can be thought that when h forms a covalent bond with a c atom of graphene the two binding electrons are paired but additionally and due to the particular topology of graphene lattice one @xmath0-electron becomes unpaired and , therefore , spin polarized . since there is no steric protection around the defect ( a kind of radical ) any more or less free electron of the system will flow into the defect to restore the equilibrium between sublattices .",
    "consequently , spin polarization around chemisorbed hydrogen disappears .",
    "this qualitative argument is fully supported by our total energy calculations showing a gain in potential energy following the spin neutralization ( remember that the binding energy of h increases about one ev for the charged system ) .",
    "from a detailed analysis based in first - principles dft calculations we find that in the presence of an extra electron chemisorbed h plays to keep most of the extra charge in its vicinity .",
    "the electron affinities computed on finite cluster models seem to converge to a value that is somewhat smaller than the free atomic hydrogen value of @xmath14 ev .",
    "our calculations suggest that being graphene a semimetal with zero density of states at the fermi energy , screening of coulomb interactions by the @xmath0-electrons liquid is weak and allows the electron flow to sites where h is chemisorbed , forming a complex point defect .",
    "accumulation of extra charge around the defect , otherwise giving rise to spin polarization , works to quench it .",
    "we suggest that this physical effect is behind the difficulties to observe magnetism in graphene derived systems",
    ".    financial support by the spanish micinn ( mat2006 - 03741 , mat2008 - 1497 , fis2009 - 08744 and csd2007 - 41 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "a tight - binding model including carbon @xmath0-orbitals and hydrogen 1s orbital allows a straightforward although approximate solution of the topic covered in this paper .",
    "since larger sizes can be studied , qualitative conclusions on the scaling behavior of the charged system can be obtained .",
    "this calculation fully supports our arguments based on the computationally demanding _ ab initio _",
    "study done in the main part of the paper for smaller systems .",
    "although total energies are not attainable by the method , both the density of states and the charge distribution of an extra electron suggest the stability of a charged hydrogen atom bonded to graphene .",
    "the p@xmath15-p@xmath15 hopping term of the hamiltonian is -2.71 ev . comparing the ionization energy h ( 13.60 ev ) to the value for the methyl radical ( 9.84 ev ) we take the h level relative to the @xmath0 one as -3.76 ev .",
    "this is justified because of the similarity between graphene and methyl radical p@xmath15 orbital . for the c - h coupling",
    "we have taken -5.39 ev based on a simple scaling argument .",
    "a standard supercell procedure and a carefully bz integration have been used to get accurate density of states and local charge magnitudes .",
    "although very large supercells have been explored ( @xmath16 ) , we will give here results for a @xmath17 system because it shows almost converged results that are better depicted .",
    "fig.([dos ] ) shows the total density of states per spin of the supercell .",
    "it integrates to 402 ( total number of states of the cell ) and shows two salient features : ( i ) a deep level below the valence band describing the bonding c - h orbital , and ( ii ) strongly perturbed values below dirac s point energy ( 0 in the clean system ) .",
    "nevertheless , the most interesting feature relative to this density of states ( dos ) is that it integrates to 202 up to the dirac energy ( e=0 ) , i.e. , the complete occupation of the valence band describes one extra electron above half - filling which is only 201 ( 200 electrons corresponding to the 200 @xmath0-orbitals of c atoms plus one electron contributed by h ) .",
    "this means that when the fermi level coincides with the dirac point of graphene , a region with a quimisorbed h atom becomes charged by an extra electron . since the full occupancy of the valence band can be thought as closing electronic shells , some stabilization of the system can be inferred from this property of the dos .",
    "the ideas suggested by the dos are confirmed by the spatial distribution of the electronic charge induced by the addition of an extra electron to the system .",
    "fig.([mulliken ] ) ( upper panel ) has been obtained subtracting the background charge of one electron per site from a @xmath17 supercell with an additional electron .",
    "the resulting distribution can be compared with the corresponding variations of mulliken populations of our _ ab initio _ results ( lower panel ) .",
    "it shows that an important amount of charge directly resides on the hydrogen atom although the underlying carbon atom somewhat reduces the net value on the binding site in the empirical model results .",
    "yet another important part of the electron lies close to this site whereas the rest is spread over the whole supercell .",
    "the most intriguing characteristic of the charge distribution is its dual nature of localized around the defect and extended over the whole system@xcite . in any case , a tight binding model with a minimum number of orbitals reinforces our idea signaling the tendency of electrons to remain in the neighborhood of bounded hydrogen .",
