    "the search for supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite is one of the main issues in the experimental programs at lep2 and tevatron",
    ". it will play an even more important rle at the future colliders lhc , @xmath3 linear colliders with an energy range up to 2  tev , and @xmath0 colliders with an energy range up to 4  tev .",
    "tevatron and lhc are well  designed to discover susy . at these machines even some precision measurements are possible @xcite . however , for a precise determination of the underlying susy parameters lepton colliders will be necessary . owing to their good energy resolution @xmath0",
    "colliders are well suited for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the most exciting feature is the possibility of producing higgs bosons in the s ",
    "channel @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the production of third generation sfermions in @xmath0 annihilation , paying particular attention to the energy range near the higgs boson resonances .",
    "our framework is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "the mssm implies the existence of five physical higgs bosons : two scalars @xmath4 , one pseudoscalar @xmath5 , and two charged ones @xmath6 @xcite . every standard model ( sm ) fermion has two supersymmetric partners , one for each chirality state denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the sfermions of the third generation are particularly interesting @xcite because their phenomenology is different compared to that of the sfermions of the first and second generation .",
    "the reasons for this are the mixing between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the large yukawa couplings .",
    "in particular , the top quark and the stops give substantial contributions to higgs boson masses due to radiative corrections ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the top and stop contributions to the renormalization group equations play an essential rle in inducing electroweak symmetry breaking , when the higgs parameters evolve from the gut scale to the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "therefore , the couplings of the stops to the neutral higgs bosons are of special interest . also the tau and bottom yukawa couplings can be large if @xmath9 is large , giving rise to similar effects in the phenomenology of sbottoms and staus .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .  ii we present the underlying parameters and give the formulae for the production cross sections . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss numerical results for sfermion pair production . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize the main results . in the appendix",
