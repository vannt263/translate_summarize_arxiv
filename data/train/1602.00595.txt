    "the currently accepted scenario for canonical glasses includes different relaxation mechanisms that are universally present in all systems .",
    "experimentally , these different mechanisms are clearly revealed by the dielectric spectra that shows a broad low frequency peak referred to as @xmath3-relaxation @xcite and a higher frequency peak or shoulder usually called johari - goldstein @xmath4-relaxation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-relaxation is generally attributed to processes involving the cooperative dynamics of regions of molecules @xcite .",
    "the microscopical origin of the @xmath4 relaxation is still a matter of wide debate@xcite .",
    "the proposed models explain this peak as a consequence of the nonuniformity of the glassy state involving only local regions in which molecules can diffuse ( islands of mobility ) .",
    "an alternative homogeneous explanation attributes the secondary relaxation phenomena to small - angle reorientations of all the molecules @xcite .",
    "systems having translational crystalline order but rotational degrees of freedom also display a glassy behavior .",
    "since in these cases one type of degree of freedom is completely absent , they represent simplified models on which to test theoretical concepts on glassy dynamics @xcite . compounds of molecules of the type cbr@xmath1cl@xmath2 , with n=0,1,2 , are examples of systems with this characteristics @xcite .",
    "they have a series of solid - solid phase transitions attributed to the ability of the molecules to acquire rotational degrees of freedom as the temperature is increased .",
    "all these compounds crystallize from the melting to a plastic fcc phase",
    ". further reduction of the temperature leads to a @xmath6 monoclinic phase @xcite . the cases n=1 and n=2 exhibit a glass transition at 90 k that is clearly visible through calorimetric techniques and its structure shows disorder in the position of the cl and br atoms @xcite .",
    "the case n=0 can not display such a disorder and , in fact , the calorimetric curve does not show a glass transition at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the dielectric spectra of cbrcl@xmath7 and cbr@xmath8cl@xmath8 was reported by zuriaga _",
    "@xcite in the temperature range 100  250 k and 100  210 k , respectively . at the lower end of the temperature range",
    "the most relevant characteristic is that both spectra display a well - defined shoulder on the high frequencies flank of the @xmath3-peak , which is attributed to the @xmath4-relaxation .",
    "since ccl@xmath0 has no molecular dipole moment it is not accessible to dielectric experiments but it can be studied using nuclear quadrupolar resonance .",
    "interestingly , the resolution of the nqr spectra for ccl@xmath0 is well superior to the corresponding spectra for cbr@xmath8cl@xmath8 and cbrcl@xmath7 and the two techniques complement each other . on the other hand , the nqr experiments are limited to a temperature range between 77 k and 140 k , with the upper end determined by the broadening of the signal . the picture that emerges from the combined analysis",
    "is that the three compounds have a very similar dynamic evolution in the monoclinic phase as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the isostructural ccl@xmath0 shows that nonequivalent molecules in the unit cell perform reorientational jumps at different time scales due to their different crystalline environments .",
    "these results support the conclusion that the dynamic heterogeneity is intimately related to the secondary relaxation observed in these compounds @xcite .",
    "this work is a direct extension of our previous works involving halogenomethanes @xcite . in this case",
    "we have studied the monoclinic phase of ccl@xmath0 using extensive molecular dynamics simulations on a fully anisotropic cell , and the results were compared with an analytical stochastic model .",
    "the advantage of this particular system is that it allows for the determination of rotational correlation times from nqr measurements with sufficient precision to distinguish between the nonequivalent groups of molecules .",
    "the same distinction is easily done in the molecular dynamics simulations , which in turn allows for an analysis at the individual nonequivalent groups and correlate the results with the location of the molecules in the lattice .",
    "the temperature range affordable by the simulations covers from the fcc phase down to 160 k. simulations at lower temperatures became impossible as the relaxation times go beyond 10 @xmath9s .",
    "is is found that , when the spin - lattice relaxation times from the experiments and from the simulations are plotted in the 100  220 k temperature range , the two sets of curves correspond to each other very well for the five distinguishable modes suggesting that ccl@xmath0 behaves as a strong glass in the whole temperature range , in spite of the fact that the compound can not glassify due to its lack of orientational entropy .",
    "ccl@xmath0 is a tetrahedral molecule having three equivalent @xmath10 and four equivalent @xmath11 symmetry axes .",
    "following our previous work@xcite , we have modeled the ccl@xmath0 molecule as a rigid , non - polarizable tetrahedron with the carbon atom at its center and a chlorine atom at each one of the vertices .",
    "the interaction between molecules is represented by a combination of lennard - jones and coulombic terms summarized in table [ table : potential ] .",

    "the classical newton s equations were integrated using the leap - frog algorithm and the time step of the integration of the equations of motion was set to 1 fs .",
    "the production runs were extended up to 100 ns or 10 @xmath9s depending on the temperature , using in this case a time step of 5 fs .",
    "the control of the temperature was made by using a nos - hoover thermostat , with a time constant of 2.0 ps .",

    "the spatial positions of the molecules in the unit cell of the system are defined through the application of 8 symmetry operations over the 4 nonequivalent molecules ( 16 cl atoms with nonequivalent positions ) . as a consequence , the system has four distinctive groups of molecules that we will refer to as g@xmath23 , g@xmath24 , g@xmath25 and g@xmath26 . in our simulation cell ,",
    "each group contains 128 molecules .",
    "each molecule belonging to a given group has the same specific arrangement of neighboring molecules .",
    "all the molecular reorientation processes occurring during the simulations are sudden large - angle jumps of the cl atoms .",

    "the molecular jumps are detected by a spike in the test function as explained in the supporting information file .",

    "normalized frequency distribution of reorientation angles for the four distinct group of molecules , as indicated .",
    "the results correspond to the production run at 160 k. the maximum at the tetrahedral angle indicate that all jumps are @xmath5 type rotations.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in order to characterize the molecular rotations using standard self correlation methods , we calculate the relaxation of the bond orientation through self correlation functions defined as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 represents a particular c - cl bond , @xmath38 represents the position of the c - cl@xmath39 bond at the initial condition , and the angular brackets represent the average over the 128 molecules of the same group .",
    "the resulting self correlation functions are shown in figure [ cgroups ] with solid lines .",
    "the correlation times for the reorientations of the molecules depend not only on the groups but also the curves reveal that one bond ( green lines ) maintains its orientation for a time considerably longer than the other three bonds .",
    "this indicates that the molecules have preferential axes of rotation .",

    "moreover , it is found that the orientation of the two fast axes of rotations is the same , suggesting an overall dynamics anisotropy correlated to the molecular orientations .",
    "finally , our results on ccl@xmath0 suggest that the observed heterogeneous dynamic of molecules of type cxcl@xmath120 with the same crystal structure could be due to the molecular environment on the crystal and not to the breaking of the tetrahedral symmetry of the molecule . then",

    "<S> carbon tetrachloride ( ccl@xmath0 ) is one of the simplest compounds having a translationally stable monoclinic phase while exhibiting a rich rotational dynamics below 226 k. recent nuclear quadrupolar resonance ( nqr ) experiments revealed that the dynamics of ccl@xmath0 is similar to that of the other members of the isostructural series cbr@xmath1cl@xmath2 , suggesting that the universal relaxation features of canonical glasses such as @xmath3- and @xmath4-relaxation are also present in non - glass formers . using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations we studied the rotational dynamics in the monoclinic phase of ccl@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the molecules undergo @xmath5 type jump - like rotations around each one of the four c - cl bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational dynamics is very well described with a master equation using as the only input the rotational rates measured from the simulated trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the heterogeneous dynamics emerges from faster and slower modes associated with different rotational axes , which have fixed orientations relative to the crystal and are distributed among the four non - equivalent molecules of the unit cell . </S>"
