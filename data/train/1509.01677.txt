    "first we observed that , as soon as the appearance threshold is introduced ( @xmath100 hz ) , the high dimensional simplexes start braking up , releasing large numbers of lower dimensional subsimplexes : the number of @xmath22-dimensional subsimplexes in a @xmath2-dimensional simplex grows as combinatorial coefficient @xmath101 , e.g. , for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 . as a result , the complex @xmath85 rapidly inflates .",
    "as @xmath89 increases further ( @xmath94 ) , the number of `` passing '' simplexes decreases , and @xmath85 begins to shrink in all dimensions ( i.e. , @xmath105 for @xmath106 , for all @xmath107 , ( fig .

    "[ supplfigure2 ] , for @xmath117 hz , only @xmath118 of the environment is covered by the remaining simplex fields , and for @xmath111 hz the simplex map barely retains its one - piece connectedness : in some cases the complex @xmath18 splits in two ( the corresponding betti numbers , @xmath42 , are listed in table  [ suppltable1 ] , for an illustration see fig .",

    "an additional problem is that reducing the order of the assemblies violates the `` assembly code '' for spatial locations : every time several subsimplexes @xmath32 are selected from a high - order maximal simplex @xmath56 , several overlapping simplex fields @xmath122 are produced in place of a single @xmath57 . as a result , the parsimony of the representation is compromised : a location that was previously represented by a single simplex becomes represented by a few of its subsimplexes ( fig .",

    "overall , since most of the @xmath18-requirements listed in the methods fail , we are led to conclude that the most straightforward selection rule , based on selecting high appearance rates , does not produce the desired trade  off between the order of the assemblies , the frequency of their appearances , and the quality of topological representation of the environment .",

    "this improvement of the behavior of @xmath85 suggests that , despite all the shortcomings , the link - selection strategy may lead to a successful model of the place cell assembly network .",
    "after all , it is not surprising that a single selection rule does not resolve all the aspects of the cell assembly formation .",
    "yet if it captures the essence of the process , it should be possible to correct or to adjust its outcome .",
    "for example , one of the difficulties faced by the coactivity selection algorithm is that , for high @xmath89 , @xmath85 may brake into several pieces .",
    "however , the gaps between them are small . thus ,",
    "if a few discarded edges of the relational graph that originally bridged these gaps are retained , then the connectedness of @xmath85 may be spared ( fig .",
    "[ corrections]a ) .",
    "similarly , a `` hole '' in the relational graph is a linear chain of edges , connected tail to tail , with no shortcuts .",
    "however , if the links with the lower appearance rate ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) that span across the hole exist at @xmath169 , then they also can be restored ( fig .",

    "this may remove the non - contractible chains of @xmath16 simplexes in @xmath85 that compromised its path connectivity ( fig .",
    "[ corrections]c , d ) .",
    "thus , we implemented the following two _ rectification algorithms _ :",
    "1 .   * filling gaps * : find pairs of vertexes @xmath170 and @xmath171 separated in @xmath144 by more than @xmath172 edges and then test whether these vertexes are connected directly by links ( from @xmath173 whose appearance rate exceeds a lower threshold @xmath174 .",

    "* closing holes * : a closed chain containing @xmath175 edges in @xmath144 , with no shortcuts , is likely to produce a hole in @xmath85 .",
    "we identified such chains and restored the discarded cross - links whose appearance rate exceeds a lower threshold @xmath168 .",
    "thus , both rectification algorithms depend on two parameters : the length of the involved chains ( @xmath172 for gaps and @xmath176 for holes ) and the value of the reduced threshold @xmath177 and @xmath178 . in our numerical experiments",
    ", we found that the optimal value for the thresholds is @xmath179 , and the parameters range between 5 and 10 ( @xmath176 ) and 10 and 15 ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "typically , each rectification procedure is applied once or twice before the right signature of @xmath85 is achieved , and this without producing significant changes of the complex s structure , such as altering the appearance of its simplexes or increasing its size @xmath29 . as illustrated in the table  [ suppltable2]b , the correct signature in the `` repaired '' complex is achieved for all cases at @xmath111 hz .",
    "in particular , at @xmath111 hz we obtain a simplicial complex @xmath18 with the correct signature , having @xmath180 vertexes and about the same number of maximal simplexes , @xmath181 .",

    "* statistics of the vertex degrees in relaitonal graphs*. ( * a * ) the histogram of the vertex degrees @xmath22 in the neighbor - controlled relational graph @xmath184 , computed for four different @xmath185 ( method ii ) and fitted to a power law distribution @xmath186 .",

    "[ corrections]c ) where the occupancy rate is highest ( fig .  [ maps]a ) . on the one hand ,",
    "this is natural since the frequency of the place cells spiking activity certainly does depend on the frequency of the rat s visits to their respective place fields , which therefore affects the hippocampal network s architecture @xcite .",

    "however , the path connectivity of the complex @xmath202 remains deficient for all @xmath190 because the number of stable spurious @xmath16 loops remains high ( table  [ suppltable3 ] ) . after filling the gaps and closing the holes , most complexes constructed for @xmath206 acquire correct topological signatures ( table  [ suppltable3 ] ) , and the requirements to @xmath18 are satisfied",
    "thus , the simplicial complex obtained by the neighbor selection method for @xmath206 can also be viewed as a `` cell assembly complex , '' meaning it can serve as a formal model of the place cell assembly network with mean contiguity @xmath116 .",
    "the proposed approach allows creating schematic models of the place cell assembly network  the cell assembly complex @xmath18by controlling the basic phenomenological parameters of place cell coactivity and then relating the network s architecture to the net topological information it encodes .",
    "the coactivity complex @xmath4 was previously used for representing the pool of place cell coactivities @xcite .",
    "specifically , the low order ( pair and triple ) coactivity events were used to construct the @xmath55 skeleton of @xmath4 , and then its @xmath38 and @xmath16 topological loops were matched with the corresponding topological signatures of the environment . in the current study ,",
    "the entire pool of place cell coactivities is used to model the full place cell assembly network , including the higher order assemblies representing both the low - dimensional spatial environment as well as high - dimensional memory space @xcite .",
    "the learning times @xmath39 estimated from the dynamics of the @xmath38 and @xmath16 loops in @xmath18 remain close to the learning times computed for the full coactivity complex @xmath4 ( see table  [ suppltable4 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the selected , `` core '' pool of coactive place cell combinations captures the topological structure of the environment as fast and as reliably as the entire set of the place cell coactivities .",
    "we view the proposed algorithms as basic models of a more general `` phenomenological '' approach , one which can be further developed along several broad lines .",
    "first , the structure of the relational graph is currently deduced from the activity vectors defined over the entire navigation period @xmath54 minutes .",
    "a biologically more plausible selection algorithm should be adaptive : the structure of the relational graph at a given moment of time @xmath207 should be based only on the spiking information produced before @xmath208 . hence , in a more advanced model , the structure of the relational graph should develop in time , and in general the cell assemblies comprising @xmath18 should be derived using synaptic and structural plasticity mechanisms .",
    "second , the selection criteria in methods i and ii above may be individualized : the appearance threshold used to construct the relational graph can be assembly - specific , i.e. @xmath209 , so that the properties of the resulting network would be described in terms of the probability distribution of the threshold values across the cell assembly population .",
    "similarly , the number of closest neighbors can be made cell - specific , @xmath210 , which should permit better control over the topological properties both of the network and of the cell assembly complex .",
    "third , threshold control can be implemented using different coactivity metrics , for instance via the pairwise correlation coefficient @xmath211 which would connect cells with correlated spiking ( irrespective of their firing rates ) , in contrast with the metric ( [ metric ] ) , which does the opposite . in general ,",
    "two metrics @xmath212 and @xmath213 , produce relational graphs with different topologies .",
    "nevertheless , they may produce similar or identical large - scale effects , such as generating topologically identical cell assembly complexes @xmath18 , or exhibit similar learning times , @xmath39 .",
    "identifying classes of metrics that produce topologically similar results will be examined in future research .",
