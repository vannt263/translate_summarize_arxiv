    "motivated by speculation about the formation of black holes in high - energy particle collisions , there has recently been interest in binary black hole mergers with large initial boosts ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "a critical surface in phase space separates initial data which lead to merger from data which scatter at first approach , thus defining a _ threshold of immediate merger _ in the space of initial data .",
    "( note that `` scatter at first approach '' here includes data which merge at a subsequent approach . )",
    "pretorius and khurana @xcite have numerically evolved initial data near this threshold for equal mass , nonspinning black hole binaries .",
    "they find that generic smooth one - parameter families of initial data intersect the threshold once , consistent with it being a smooth hypersurface in phase space .",
    "moreover , they find that the number @xmath5 of orbits before either merger or flying apart increases with fine - tuning to the threshold , with @xmath5 scaling approximately as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is any _ smooth _",
    "parameter along the family of initial data , and @xmath8 its value at the threshold of immediate merger .",
    "the additive constant depends on the family and on how @xmath7 is defined , but the dimensionless _",

    "@xmath2 is independent of the family ( for the reasons reviewed in sec .",
    "[ section : dynsim ] ) . in @xcite , where initial data with relative boosts of around @xmath9 are evolved , ( [ nscaling ] ) is found to be a good fit for @xmath10 with @xmath11 .    in this regime , a fraction of @xmath12 to @xmath13 of the rest mass is radiated per orbit @xcite . while their initial data are rest mass - dominated , pretorius and khurana speculate that in large - boost initial data fine - tuned to the critical impact parameter , most of the initial kinetic energy , and hence most of the total energy , can be turned into gravitational radiation over a large number of orbits .",
    "this is quite different from the situation for either large @xcite or small @xcite impact parameter .",
    "hence in a particle physics context , there is a small cross section ( corresponding to fine - tuned impact parameter ) in which the gravitational wave energy emitted is much larger than in a generic collision .    in a subsequent paper",
    "using a different numerical code , sperhake and collaborators @xcite evolved initial data with boosts around @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath2 is estimated as @xmath16 , and the scaling law is observed for the range @xmath17 .",
    "no data for critical scaling of the energy are given but in these more relativistic collisions , the fraction of total energy radiated is reported to be as high as @xmath18 for the higher boost .",
    "comparison with the results of @xcite suggests that @xmath2 and the energy radiated depend on the initial boost ( initial energy ) .",
    "pretorius and khurana @xcite note that what they observe in full numerical relativity is similar to `` zoom - whirl '' behaviour @xcite in the timelike geodesics of test particles in a black - hole spacetime when the impact parameter is fine - tuned to its critical value , now characterising the threshold of immediate capture .",
    "hence they propose equatorial orbits of a test particle on a kerr spacetime ( with mass and angular momentum set to the total mass and angular momentum of the binary ) as a toy model for the equal mass binary .",
    "they point out that the critical solutions mediating this behaviour are the unstable circular orbits , and use this to calculate the critical exponent for this toy model .",
    "we obtain their results as a limiting case of ours in sec .",
    "[ section : geodesicscaling ] below .",
    "the presence of critical phenomena suggests the existence of a critical solution defined by having a single growing perturbation mode and usually also characterised by a symmetry . because energy is lost through gravitational radiation , the critical solution can not be stationary , and because the black holes have rest mass it can not be self - similar",
    "we suggest that the critical solution is an unstable `` as circular as possible '' orbit that in the limit where one of the two objects becomes a test particle is indeed one of the unstable circular orbits considered by pretorius and khurana .    in this paper",
    ", we extend their analysis to binaries with large but finite mass ratio , and include radiation reaction in the self - force approximation .",
    "we restrict to the case where the large black hole is schwarzschild , but our methods are in principle applicable to kerr .",
    "this mathematical approach allows us to clarify the nature of the critical solution as adiabatically stationary and , based on this , compute the orbit and radiation as a function of the initial data .    in the large mass ratio regime",
    ", we confirm the conjecture of pretorius and khurana that almost all the kinetic energy of the binary ( which in turn is almost all the total energy for ultrarelativistic collisions ) is radiated if the fine - tuning of the initial data is sufficiently good .",
    "we find , however , that the number of orbits remains finite as fine - tuning is improved , while ( [ nscaling ] ) holds only for sufficiently small @xmath4 and @xmath19 .",

    "for the basic critical phenomena picture , we do not need to distinguish between field theories and finite - dimensional dynamical systems ( and so do not write any @xmath25-dependence ) .",
    "this will later allow us to approximate a field theory ( general relativity ) by a finite - dimensional dissipative dynamical system ( particle orbits with self - force ) .",
    "assume that at late times there are two qualitatively distinct outcomes , such as scattering and plunge in our system .",
    "there must then be a hypersurface in phase space separating these two basins of attraction , called the _",
    "critical surface_. as solution curves in phase space can not intersect , the critical surface must be a dynamical system in its own right .",
    "assume that the critical surface , considered as a dynamical system , has an attractor , called the _",
    "critical solution _ @xmath26 . as @xmath26 is a fixed point ( independent of @xmath27 ) , its linear perturbations must be a sum of modes of the form @xmath28 , with @xmath29 also independent of @xmath27 . as @xmath26 is an attractor within the critical hypersurface ,",

    "consider now initial data near the critical surface , with @xmath31 sufficiently small so that @xmath24 passes close to @xmath26 during the evolution , and we can use perturbation theory about @xmath26 .",
    "there is then a range of @xmath27 where the decaying modes can be already neglected and the growing mode @xmath32 is still small enough for perturbation theory to hold , leading to the approximation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is some constant that depends on the particular one - parameter family .",
    "now define @xmath35 by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a fairly arbitrary constant , representing a reference deviation from the critical solution where it becomes apparent on which side of the critical surface the solution is going to end up .",
    "one then finds @xmath38 where @xmath39 depends on @xmath34 and @xmath37 , and @xmath40 is called the _",
    "critical exponent_.    essentially the same picture holds if @xmath26 is not a fixed point but a limit cycle ( periodic in @xmath27 ) .",
    "then @xmath32 is also periodic in @xmath27 and so is @xmath39 , and this leads to a modulation of the scaling law periodic in @xmath41 .",
    "this generalisation is not relevant for our application , but might be for extreme - mass ratio orbits in kerr not in the equatorial plane , or more generally for binaries with spin .",
    "however , another generalisation is relevant here .",
    "as we shall see , in the geodesic toy model of pretorius and khurana the critical solution is not an isolated attractor , but instead there is a line of critical solutions ( each of which represents an unstable circular orbit , and has precisely one growing mode ) . in the self - force approximation to extreme mass ratio binaries , by contrast , these merge into a single critical solution , which can be approximated as an adiabatic motion along the line of unstable circular geodesic orbits , and so is slowly time - dependent .",
    "the general dynamical system picture above remains again basically unchanged , except that in the first case @xmath26 , @xmath32 and @xmath42 form a one - parameter family ( parameterised for example by the energy of the orbit ) , and in the second case they become slowly varying functions of @xmath27 .",
    "to establish notation , we review the trajectories of test particles , modelled as geodesics , on schwarzschild spacetime . let @xmath43 be the usual schwarzschild coordinates , so that the schwarzschild metric is @xmath44 and let a dot denote the derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath45 of the particle .",

    "two surprising features of the critical solution at the threshold of immediate merger , at least in the extreme - mass ratio approximation , are its unfamiliar ( approximate ) symmetry , and the fact that the _ fraction _ of @xmath58 radiated per orbit increases with @xmath58 fast enough that the critical solution evolves from @xmath144 ( or at least from @xmath390 , for any fixed finite mass ratio @xmath4 ) to plunge at @xmath391 in a finite number of orbits .",

    "evidence that the fraction of energy radiated per orbit increases with energy is given by comparing the numerical relativity results of @xcite ( @xmath392 at a boost of @xmath393 ) and @xcite ( @xmath394 at a boost of @xmath395 @xcite ) .",
    "we should stress again that for any given mass ratio @xmath4 ( and spins ) there is only one critical solution , which begins with infinite energy .",
    "we also conjecture that this solution radiates an infinite amount of energy over a finite , probably quite small , number of orbits . at low energies ,",
    "an adiabatic approximation should be possible , where the critical solution evolves along a sequence of stationary solutions with a helical killing vector under the influence of radiation reaction , but if our conjecture is correct this breaks down at sufficiently large energy .    in the comparable mass case",

    "as the critical solution is by definition always between scattering and merger , we also expect @xmath403 along the critical solution . in the limit @xmath404 , ( [ bsime ] ) gives us @xmath405 and from ( [ rsime ] ) the critical solution _",
