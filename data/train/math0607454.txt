    "we expand the discussion in the introduction concerning the relations between the three problems .",
    "we first discuss the relation between problems 2 and 3 .",
    "the ( a)-part of the following theorem is standard , see for example the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the ( b)-part follows from theorem 1.2 of @xcite , see also theorem 1.3 of @xcite and the paragraph following it . of course , the ( b)-part is clear for the simply - laced groups .",

    "= 3.5 in    we may restate the previous theorem by saying that the semigroup @xmath145 is the saturation of the semigroup @xmath72 in the semigroup @xmath73 .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly indicating why the solutions of problems 1 and 2 coincide .",
    "first of all , problem 2 ( in the case of an @xmath146fold sum ) can be reformulated geometrically as a problem of the existence of geodesic polygons in @xmath147 with fixed @xmath148valued side - lengths . both @xmath147 and the symmetric space @xmath30 admit compactifications by a `` visual '' sphere @xmath149 which also has the structure of a spherical building @xmath150 .",
    "the vertices of this building are points in the flag manifolds @xmath48 ( where @xmath151 s are the maximal parabolic subgroups in @xmath10 )",
    ".    then one can define the _ gauss map _",
    "@xmath152 which sends the geodesic polygon @xmath153\\subset x$ ] to the weighted configuration @xmath154)=((m_1 , \\xi_1 ) , ... , ( m_n , \\xi_n))\\ ] ] of points in @xmath149 . here @xmath155 are the ordinary distances , which serve as _ weights _ at the points @xmath156 .",
    "the same definition also works for @xmath30 replaced by @xmath147 .",
    "the gauss map from quadrilaterals in the hyperbolic plane to configurations of four points @xmath157 on the visual boundary ( the circle ) is depicted in figure [ gauss.fig ] .",
    "the key problem then is to identify the images of gauss maps @xmath152 for @xmath30 and @xmath147 .",
    "it turns out that both consist of nice semistable weighted configurations on @xmath149 , where the notion of stability is essentially the one introduced by mumford in geometric invariant theory ( in the case when the weights are natural numbers ) .",
    "we refer the reader to theorems 5.2 and 5.9 of @xcite for the precise statements .",
    "therefore , problems 1 and 2 are both equivalent to the existence problem for semistable weighted configurations on @xmath149 and hence problems 1 and 2 are equivalent .",
    "we need more notation . we let @xmath158 be the set of ( simple ) reflections in the root hyperplanes defined by the simple roots and",
    "let @xmath159 be the weyl group generated by @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath160 be the basis of @xmath20 dual to the basis @xmath161 , i.e. , @xmath162 .",

    "the naive triangle inequality @xmath173 does not hold @xcite . here",
    "the order @xmath174 is the one defined by the ( acute ) cone @xmath2 .",
    "this can be remedied if we replace @xmath2 by the dual ( obtuse ) cone @xmath175 and let @xmath176 denote the associated order .",
    "then , the analogue of the above inequality holds and , in fact , for any element @xmath177 of the weyl group @xmath164 , the inequality @xmath178 holds .",
    "we call the resulting system of inequalities ( as @xmath177 varies ) the _ weak triangle inequalities _ to be denoted @xmath179 .    for the root systems @xmath107 of ranks one and two",
    ", the weak triangle inequalities already give a solution to problems 1 and 2 of the introduction .",
    "however , they are no longer sufficient in ranks three or more .",
    "we now describe a system of linear inequalities on @xmath180 which describes the cone @xmath181 . however , this system is usually not irredundant .",
    "these inequalities ( based on the cup - product of schubert classes ) will be called the _ extended triangle inequalities_. the system of extended triangle inequalities is independent of the choice of @xmath10 corresponding to a fixed lie algebra @xmath17 , hence depends only on the root system @xmath107 associated to @xmath10 .",
