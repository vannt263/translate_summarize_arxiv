    "inclusive decays of @xmath1 mesons can be analyzed via an operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite as a power series in @xmath3 . at leading order",
    "the ope reproduces the parton model results , while non - perturbative physics is parametrized by matrix elements of higher dimensional operators and suppressed by powers of the heavy quark mass .    in practice ,",
    "higher dimensional operators in the ope are only suppressed for sufficiently inclusive observables . in the resonance regime , where the invariant mass of the final hadronic state is restricted to be @xmath4 , the decay is no longer inclusive and it is not surprising that the ope completely breaks down .",
    "however , the ope includes terms suppressed by @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energy and invariant mass of the final hadronic state ) which are suppressed over most of phase space , but are @xmath8 in the region of high energy , low invariant mass hadronic states , @xmath9 in this  shape function region \" the ope breaks down , even though it is far from the resonance regime . thus an inclusive description is still appropriate , but the expansion parameter in the ope has to be modified .",
    "it has been shown that the most singular terms in the ope may be resummed into a non - local operator@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a light - like vector in the direction of the final hadrons , @xmath12 is a hqet heavy quark field and we denote variables normalized to @xmath13 by a hat : @xmath14 .",
    "the matrix element of this operator in a @xmath1 meson is the light - cone structure function of the meson , @xmath15 the rate in the shape function region is determined by @xmath16 .",
    "however , since it is a non - perturbative function , @xmath16 can not be calculated analytically , and the rate in the shape function region is model - dependent even at leading order in @xmath3 .    unfortunately , for @xmath17 decay ( and to a lesser extent @xmath18 )",
    ", the experimental cuts which must be imposed on the phase space to eliminate large backgrounds from @xmath19 decay typically put the decay into the shape function region , introducing large model - dependence in the predicted rate . for semileptonic @xmath20 decay , this is the case for cuts on either the charged lepton energy or the hadronic invariant mass@xcite , and this model dependence is the major theoretical stumbling block to a precise determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath21 from inclusive decays .",
    "however , since the distribution function ( [ distfn ] ) determines the shape of the photon spectrum in @xmath18 as well as the charged lepton or hadronic invariant mass spectrum in @xmath17 , it was suggested a number of years ago@xcite that @xmath22 could be measured in @xmath18 , and then used to extract @xmath21 from semileptonic decay .",
    "the perturbative corrections to the relation between these processes have been intensely studied in recent years@xcite .",
    "in addition to the radiative corrections , however , there are non - perturbative corrections to the relation between the photon spectrum in @xmath23 and the lepton or hadronic invariant mass spectra in @xmath24 .",
    "the light - cone distribution function ( [ distfn ] ) only resums the most singular terms of the ope in the shape function region .",
    "there are corrections to this from less singular terms suppressed by @xmath3 , analogous to higher - twist corrections to deep inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "these corrections are important for a precision measurement of @xmath21 via this method , but have not yet been studied .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the subleading corrections to heavy - light @xmath1 decay in the shape function region by performing a twist expansion rather than the usual ope in terms of local operators qcd is matched onto an intermediate theory with collinear and soft degrees of freedom , while at a lower scale the non - local ope is performed .",
    "since we are not concerned with summing sudakov logarithms in this paper , we may neglect the intermediate theory . ] . at",
    "leading order in the twist expansion we reproduce the known results , while at subleading order we find four new non - local operators relevant for @xmath1 decays .",

    "we introduce a light - like vector @xmath11 to define the expansion of the jet about the light - cone , and the velocity of the heavy quark then defines a second light - like vector @xmath35 .",
    "these vectors satisfy @xmath36 in the frame in which the @xmath0 quark is at rest and the emitted hadrons move in the @xmath37 direction , these vectors are given by @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40",

    "thus , instead of resumming terms of this form to all orders , we perform an ope in powers of @xmath3 , but using the scaling ( [ qscaling ] ) .",

    "since the leading distribution function is not known , much less to 10 - 20% accuracy , these results are of limited utility for @xmath18 decays ( although they do indicate the region where the twist expansion breaks down ) .",
