    "for wide - field adaptive optics  ( wfao ) systems , the turbulence is compensated in a large field of view  ( fov ) using a tomographic reconstruction of the phase in the entire volume  ( @xcite ) or in discrete directions  ( @xcite ) , from wave - front sensor  ( wfs ) measurements distributed over the system fov .",
    "knowledge of the statistical turbulence parameters is paramount , with several methods being dedicated to estimating them as slodar  ( @xcite ) , mass  ( @xcite ) and scidar  ( @xcite ) techniques .    as a moao on - sky demonstrator ,",
    "canary has been observing at the william herschel telescope  ( wht ) since 2010  ( @xcite ) . since an open - loop configuration",
    "is adopted , the lack of feedback between the deformable mirror  ( dm ) and wfs makes the control more sensitive to inaccuracies on the command matrix calibration .",
    "the recursive nature of a closed - loop tends to wash out these effects , which clearly is not the case here .",
    "vidal et al has proposed in  @xcite the the learn & apply  ( l&a ) technique that combines both turbulence profiling and system mis - registration identification / calibration .",
    "the efficiency of this method has been demonstrated on - sky with canary  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the l&a consists in model - fitting the spatial covariance matrix of wfs measurements .",
    "the fitting is ensured thanks to the levenberg - marquardt iterative algorithm which estimates a number of model - parameters , as the @xmath0 profile , the outer scale profile and the stars position . in view of calibration ,",
    "the primary model proposed by vidal @xcite included system mis - registration : pupil shifts , rotation and magnification between wfs .",
    "we used in the past a model @xcite based on a fourier transformation of the von - krmn spectrum to get the bi - dimensional ( 2d ) spatial covariance of the wave - front slopes .",
    "the algorithm was particularly efficient when coupled to wave - front sensors with fixed sub - aperture sizes , because the computation using fast fourier transforms ( fft ) could be used to extract in one shot from the same 2d map all the covariance values between two wave - front sensors with arbitrary separation , without requiring any re - interpolation of the map -provided the sub - aperture size is a multiple of the fft sampling .",
    "now , the cone effect inherent to lgs induces layer - projected sub - aperture sizes and pupil sizes to vary with the altitude , which breaks the efficiency of the implementation when it s a matter of computing covariances between lgs and ngs .",
    "at least , an interpolation procedure could be implemented in order to access values that lay between covariance samples of the fft , but unfortunately this kind of approximation does not go well with a fitting procedure that internally requires to compute derivatives as finite differences of the covariance function .",
    "we propose thus in sect .",
    "[ s1 ] a fast - computable model that includes both turbulence characteristics and system mis - registration .    to speed up the fitting algorithm",
    ", we propose in sect.[s : l3s ] an upgrade to the l&a , called the _ learn 3 steps  ( l3s ) _ , that splits the identification of the ground layer parameters from those of altitude layers .",
    "the ground layer is known to dominate the turbulence strength with relatively slow time - variations  ( @xcite ) .",
    "it appears thus that a large time - span of accumulated data would be required to obtain statistical convergence on the generation of the covariance matrices of phase  ( @xcite ) , the latter being an input to the tomography . in splitting the ground and altitude parts",
    ", we mitigate the mis - convergence of statistics obtained from system telemetry .",
    "in addition , we have included in the l3s a separate estimation of the wind - speed profile . from the turbulence profile ,",
    "we reconstruct the phase at each retrieved altitude using an mmse approach .",
    "the wind - speeds on those layers is then determined from the full width at half maximum  ( fwhm ) of the average temporal auto - correlation function of slopes .",
    "we present then in sect .",
    "[ s : stats ] a characterization of the turbulence along altitude above the wht from the canary on - sky data acquired in september 2013 .",
    "we have processed about 2,000 data sets with the l3s algorithm to present plots of distribution of the seeing , outer scale and wind - speed .",
    "we have also characterized the median values for the ground layer  ( below 1.5 km ) the altitude layers  ( between 1.5 and 20  km ) and the very high altitude layers  ( above 20  km ) inaccessible to tomography with canary .",

    "we get on average a ground seeing of 0.67 \" , which is close to the reported value at the wht  ( http://www.ing.iac.es/astronomy/telescopes/wht/ ) .",
    "according to histograms in fig .",
    "[ f : cnhprof ] , the ground layer also dominates the seeing variability .",
    "altitude layers below 20  km reach an average seeing of 0.26 \" and stay relatively constant in strength with time .",
    "we also notice negative altitude layers .",
    "they may appear between the wht primary and secondary mirror , but we can not determine if they really exist or if this is a lma artifact .    note the very altitude layers , above 20  km and too high for being reconstructed by tomography with canary , reach 7.5% of the total turbulence in median value , with 0.187 \" of seeing .",
    "however this only occurs in 16% of cases .",
    "it means this phenomena is not so frequent , but significant in terms of seeing .",
    "[ f : cnhprof ] displays the vertical outer scale distribution .",
    "the relevance of the outer scale for tomography and psf reconstruction is one of the actual preoccupation  ( see .",
    "paper 9909 - 16 _ review on ao real - time turbulence estimation _ in that conference ) .",
    "the plot is less dense than the ones from the seeing and wind - speed distribution since 55% of samples have reached more than 100  m of outer scale .",
    "this is a software breakdown in the l3s code : above 100  m of outer scale , we no longer consider these is any physical meaning .    from the outer scale distribution ,",
    "we draw two other observations : firstly , in more than 55% the l3s  ( and generally the l&a approach ) retrieves an outer scale larger than 100  m. this is a software breakdown we have implemented into the spatial covariance model  : if the lma reaches this limit , we stick the value to 100  m , we consider there is no more physical meaning on that . in",
    "excluding those 55% of cases , we have 6% of cases that reach more than 20  m , 2.7% with more than 30  m and only 1% of cases with an outer scale greater than 50  m.    the question now is why in 55% of cases is the l&a approach retrieved a fake value of the outer scale ?    a main reason is we are observing with a 4.2  m telescope and we are not sensitive to large values of outer scale .",
    "but now , we can wonder whether we are reaching the software breakdown of 100  m because the aperture - size of the telescope or because any other reason to be determined using end - to - end simulation .",
    "+ secondly , this distribution of @xmath117 is quite constant around twice the telescope diameter and is constrained by the ground layer .",
    "[ t : statturbu ] shows @xmath118 becomes larger in altitude compared to the ground value .",
    "the conclusion on that is the estimation of the outer scale we have is biased by the finite aperture size from which we observe the turbulence .    in altitude , because the stars angular separations , the meta - pupil size is increasing with the altitude .",
    "it is exactly like the aperture - size through which we observe the turbulence is increasing as well , as the outer scale in altitude looks to do according to fig .  [",
    "f : cnhprof ] .    from those two observations ,",
    "we conclude the estimation of the outer scale we are doing on a 4.2  m telescope is not directly related to a physical quantity .",
    "the problem we have now is to determine whether taking into account the entire outer scale profile is relevant for tomography and psf - reconstruction on canary and demonstrate and understand why , using end - to - end simulations , the outer scale , as we have defined in eq .",
    "[ e : l0eff ] , is twice the meta - pupil size .",
    "figure  [ f : cnhprof ] illustrates the wind - speed profile as well .",
    "it appears the ground turbulence is the slowest one , with 2.89 m.s@xmath1 , against 5.22 m.s@xmath1 in altitude .",
    "we get a very strong variability of wind - speed values , especially in altitude , it makes thus the l3s approach more valuable .",
    "+ finally , the distributions of seeing , outer scale and wind - speed in fig .",
    "[ f : cnhprof ] are denser around particular altitudes .",
    "these are the most contributing layers to the turbulence and are located at the ground , around 2  km , 6  km , 10  km and 16  km .",
    "the tomographic resolution we have on canary allows to retrieve on average five turbulent layers .",
    "we have discussed on the l3s approach , an upgrade of the learn & apply algorithm , which dissociates the identification of the altitude layers from the ground layer . under nominal observation conditions , the parameters it estimates lead to the same level of tomographic error than the l&a approach in using five time less temporal frames than the latter .",
    "moreover , we can gain up to 30% on the tomographic error using the l3s .",
    "the l3s technique has been applied over a large set of canary data to characterize the turbulence above the william herschel telescope  ( wht ) : we find 0.67``/8.9m/3.07m.s@xmath1 of total seeing / outer scale / wind - speed against 0.55''/9.2m/2.89m.s@xmath1 below 1.5  km and 0.263``/10.3m/5.22m.s@xmath1 between 1.5 and 20 km .",
    "we have also determined that the high altitude layers above 20  km , that can not be compensated by canary , appear only 16% of time with a median seeing of 0.187 '' .",
