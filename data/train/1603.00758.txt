    "over the past few years , an increasing attention has been paid to the interaction between a particle and a ( perfect or imperfect ) mirror or any dielectric surface @xcite .",
    "one of the main interests has been to calculate the frictional force exerted over the particle by the plate , mediated by the vacuum field fluctuations . as in the case of the quantum friction between two plates",
    "@xcite , there is still no general agreement about the nature of this frictional force .",
    "these frictional effects are interesting , macroscopically observable consequences of the quantum nature of microscopic systems",
    ". however , frictional and normal ( casimir ) forces are not the only effects of the vacuum quantum fluctuations .",
    "any quantum system that interacts with an environment will suffer the process of decoherence , which is one of the main ingredients necessary to understand the quantum - classical transition .",
    "the vacuum field is , clearly , an environment that can not be switched off , since any particle ( charged or with non - vanishing dipole moment ) will unavoidably interact with the electromagnetic field fluctuations .",
    "the effects of the electromagnetic field over the coherence of the quantum state of a particle , and the way in which this effect is modified by the presence of a conducting plate , has already been studied for interference experiments @xcite .",
    "however , in the many studies of the quantum friction over a moving particle in front of a dielectric plate , the effects of decoherence have not yet been taken into consideration . in this work",
    ", we will study the decoherence of the internal degree of freedom of the particle .",
    "the loss of coherence of the particle s dipolar moment becomes relevant in any ramsey interferometry experiment , where the depolarization of the atom could be macroscopically observed by means of the ramsey fringes . in the case of a rydberg atom , this phenomenon could be also observed as a decay of the raby oscillations @xcite .    on this work we consider a neutral particle moving in front of an imperfect mirror .",
    "the trajectory of the particle will be , along this paper , kept as an externally - fixed variable .",
    "this accounts for many of the cases of interest , for example , when the particle is the tip of a atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "when we specify the system , we will have the particle moving at a constant velocity @xmath0 , as is the most popular scenario in the literature @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of the internal degree of freedom of the particle , that we will model as a quantum harmonic oscillator , being a simple model for the particle s electric dipole , and that will be coupled in position to the vacuum field .",
    "we will also use a simple model for the microscopic degrees of freedom of the mirror , as we have done in a previous work @xcite : a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators , each of them also interacting locally with the vacuum field . even though this is a simple model , it allows us to calculate some relevant quantities without much further assumptions .",
    "we will study both the effects of friction and of decoherence over the moving particle , from the perspective of quantum field theory . in order to do so",
    ", we will use two different but similar approaches . to study the friction",
    ", we will follow the procedure presented in our previous work @xcite , where we studied the friction generated by the relative motion of two dielectric plates .",
    "we will calculate the imaginary part of the in - out effective action , that will account for the dissipative effects . to study the decoherence",
    ", we will switch to the closed time path ( ctp ) formalism and calculate the action of influence of the environment ( vacuum field + plate ) over the particle , and use it to obtain an estimation of the decoherence time , following an approach similar to the one in a previous work by some of us @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : inout ] we define the system we study , and present the formalism in minkowski space .",
    "we then calculate the in - out effective action for a specific microscopic model , and obtain an expression for the imaginary part of the effective action ( and hence the dissipative effects over the system ) as a function of the relative velocity . in section [ sec : ctp ]",
    "we review the schwinger - keldysh formalism and obtain a general expression for the ctp influence action for the internal degree of freedom of the particle , and use it to obtain the stochastic equations of motion for the particle s internal degree of freedom . in section [ sec :",
    "deco ] , we present a way to estimate of the decoherence time , and then analyze the way in which it is modified by the presence of the plate . finally , in sec .",

    "a clear minimum appears for every value of @xmath0 , and it is located in @xmath251 .",
    "this means that the decoherence is maximal in the resonant case , hence making the decoherece time vanish .",
    "far from the resonance , that is , for values of @xmath252 ( or the opposite limit when possible ) , the decoherence time tends to the limiting value that corresponds to the case @xmath253 ( the case with no plate ) .    from the results shown above",
    ", we can see that , in this simple model , the presence of the plate enhances the decoherence over the particle .",
    "the decoherence effects can be maximized by an appropiate choice of the atom s fine - grained history ( @xmath254 the classical amplitud difference in our example ) and the plate s material ( for a relation between the @xmath255 function of the material and its dielectric permitivity @xmath256 , see ref .",

    "we also show that the relative velocity contributes to the enhancing of the decoherence effects .",
    "in this paper we have used a functional approach to study the effects of quantum vacuum fluctuations on a particle moving parallel to an imperfect mirror .",
    "we have presented a simple model in which the vacuum field is a massless , real , scalar field coupled to the microscopic degrees of freedom of the mirror and the internal degree of freedom of the particle . in our simple model , the plate is formed by uncoupled unidimensional harmonic oscillators , each of them interacting locally in position with the vacuum field .",
    "the macroscopic trajectory of the particle was externally fixed , and its internal degree of freedom was also an unidimensional harmonic oscillator , also coupled in position with the scalar field , resulting in a dipole - like interaction .",
    "we first studied the dissipative effects over the system . in order to do that",
    ", we followed the same approach we had used in our previous work @xcite : we calculate the in - out effective action for the whole system , which presented an imaginary part that accounted for the non - vanishing probability of decay of the system s initial state due to friction .",
    "we found that these dissipative effects depended on the relative velocity between the particle and the mirror , and on the characteristic of the materials .",
    "we also found that , within our simple model , the imaginary part of the effective action for a particle moving in front of a mirror is the same as the imaginary part of the effective action per unit of area for two mirrors in parallel relative motion @xcite .",
    "then , we switched to the schiwinger - keldysh or ctp formalism in order to study the decoherence suffered by the particle due to its interaction with the vacuum field fluctuations , and its effective ( mediated by the vacuum field ) interaction with the mirror .",
    "we calculated the ctp effective action describing the influence of the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of freedom of the mirror over the internal degree of freedom of the particle .",
    "this action of influence allowed us to estimate the decoherence time , in which two different quantum states for the particle could no longer be distinguished from one another .",
    "we found the decoherence time to decrease with the presence of the mirror , and to be minimized when the characteristic frequencies of the mirror and the particle are the same ( resonant case ) .",
    "we also found that the relative velocity between the mirror and the plate increases the decoherence , as does the increasing of any of the coupling constants .",
    "we expect that in a ramsey - like interference experiment , the parameters of our model could be chosen in a way that would maximize the decoherence effects . as we have modeled the atom as the lowest energy levels of a harmonic oscillator , it is possible to choose its characteristic frequency close to the resonance with the plate .",
    "in addition , with a non - vanishing relative velocity , we expect decoherence effects to be observed by means of the attenuation of the contrast in the ramsey fringes .",
