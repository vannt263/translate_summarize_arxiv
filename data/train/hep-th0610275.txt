    "the wilson loop is one of the most interesting quantities which appeared in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in the computation of the expectation value of the wilson loop , the stringy effect ( not just the supergravity ) is essential .",
    "actually , it is calculated on the ads side as the on - shell action of a classical macroscopic string@xcite in the limit of large @xmath3 and large t hooft coupling @xmath4 .",
    "recently , certain d - brane pictures of wilson loops have drawn wide attention because they are powerful in evaluating the wilson loop of higher rank representation .",
    "the d3-brane with electric flux , which has already been investigated in @xcite , is found to describe wilson loops of symmetric representations ( or multiply wound wilson loops ) by drukker and fiol @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the wilson loop of anti - symmetric representation is found to be described by a d5-brane with electric flux@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the results show successful agreement with the gauge theory side calculations @xcite .",
    "other further investigations along this line can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena in the ads picture of wilson loops is the phase transition , which occurs in the two wilson loop correlator .",
    "this is first anticipated by gross and ooguri @xcite , and further explored in @xcite .",
    "if the two loops are close enough , the classical string of annulus topology leads to the smallest action , which dominates the connected correlator .",
    "by contrast , when the two loops get far enough , two disk solution with massless propagating modes dominates the connected correlator . between them",
    ", there exists a critical point .    in this paper",
    ", we study two concentric circular wilson loop correlator of different representations , i.e. one is fundamental and the other is anti - symmetric .",
    "because the circular anti - symmetric wilson loop has a gravity dual as a d5-brane with electric flux , this correlator can thus be recognized as a system of a d5-brane and an f - string .",
    "more explicitly , it is realized as a string which propagates between the ads boundary and the d5-brane .    here",
    "let us summarize the results of this paper .",
    "we calculated the correlator by evaluating the on - shell action of the string worldsheet .",
    "this correlator also exibits the phase transition .",
    "the phase structure is shown in figures  [ pi/2 ] , [ 2pi/3 ] and [ pi/3 ] .",
    "the critical surface of the phase transition is represented by a solid line .",
    "there is also a critical surface represented by a dashed line where the annulus solution becomes unstable .    the parameter @xmath5 ( direction in @xmath6 ) dependence is quite nontrivial and interesting . as easily seen from the figures [ pi/2 ] , [ 2pi/3 ] and [ pi/3 ] , as well as from the expression in section 3",
    ", the correlator has the symmetry @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a function of @xmath9 as in eq .. especially , the point @xmath10 looks similar to the point @xmath11 . at @xmath11 ,",
    "it is always in the disk phase , since it is bps even when two loops get on top of each other . on the other hand , @xmath10 is not a priori related to the bps configuration , but it is always in the disk phase .",
    "this fact implies that overlapped loops at @xmath10 bear a similar nature to the bps loops .",
    "another interesting feature related to @xmath5 dependence is the maximum of the critical distance .",
    "the critical distance is maximal at @xmath12 .",
    "this is reasonable in the ads picture since the d5-brane sits at @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is rather misterious because the origin of @xmath8 is quite different from @xmath5 on the gauge theory side",
    ". it should be interesting and useful to consider the origin of @xmath8 more geometrically on the gause theory side .",
    "we also studied a couple of limiting cases .",
    "the solution of two fundamental wilson loop correlator first examined by zarembo@xcite is recovered , meanwhile the coulomb - like behavior is found when the separation is much smaller than the circle radii .    as a future work",
    ", the yang - mills side analysis like @xcite seems to be interesting .",
    "correlators of wilson loops of other representations by using the d3-brane @xcite or supergravity solutions @xcite are as well worthy of study . also , the extension to finite temperature cases is in progress .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2 ,",
    "the detailed setup is given .",
    "in sec.3 , the ads side calculation is performed through a series of elliptic integrals .",
    "finally , in sec.4 , we plotted the phase diagram , which visualizes clearly the gross - ooguri transition .",
    "comments on these solutions are also provided , where known results appear as limiting cases . some definitions and algebra involving elliptic integrals",
    "are added in the appendix [ app - a ] .",

    "the d5-brane is rigid because it is much heavier than the fundamental string .",
    "by contrast , the string is flexible , so various kinds of contributions should be considered .",
    "there are two possible leading contributions to @xmath34 .",
    "one is a disk bounded by @xmath24 with massless propagating modes connecting the f - string and the d5-brane ( see figure [ fig - disk ] ) .",
    "the other is an annulus whose boundaries are attached to the d5-brane and @xmath24 ( see figure [ fig - annulus ] ) .",
    "these two contributions are of the same order @xmath35 in @xmath29 expansion .",
    "their magnitudes are estimated by the on - shell action of the annulus and the disk to the amplitude . while is compared to @xmath36",

    ", the massless propagator is of order @xmath38 and the coupling to the d5-brane is of order @xmath39 .",

''",
    "] @xmath53 on the ads side , this simple dependence on @xmath54 is not quite trivial .",
    "this is due to the introduction of the cutoff , which makes the conformal symmetry not manifest . in order to check this conformal symmetry ,",
