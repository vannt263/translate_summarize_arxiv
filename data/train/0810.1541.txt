    "this common proper motion pair moves at a relatively large angular speed of roughly 2  arcsec per year , which may be indicative of population  ii membership .",
    "because of this , it has been considered a useful system for estimating the primordial helium abundance of the universe through the detailed study of its components @xcite .",
    "cm  dra was first investigated spectroscopically and photometrically by @xcite , and more recently by @xcite .",

    "the unique position of cm  dra as the best known binary system composed of fully convective stars makes it exceptionally important for testing models of such objects , and fully justifies a reanalysis in the light of our new observations .",
    "an important feature of this system is that , unlike other well - known low - mass ebs , its orbit has a small but measurable eccentricity .",
    "the precise measurement of eclipse timings over a sufficiently long period can thus potentially lead to the detection of apsidal motion .",
    "the rate of this motion can be used to infer the internal structure constant @xmath14 @xcite , with which further tests of the models are possible .",
    "in addition , the investigation of the times of eclipse can also reveal the presence of third bodies in the system through the light - time effect .",
    "attempts to detect planets around cm  dra in this way have been carried out in the context of the transit of extrasolar planets project ( tep , @xcite ) , although no compelling evidence of such objects has been found as yet .    in this paper",
    "we present a thorough reanalysis of cm  dra to determine the fundamental properties of its components , including the masses , radii and effective temperatures .",

    "the template for both components was chosen to be an observation of barnard s star ( gj  699 , m4ve ) taken with a similar instrumental setup , which provides a close match to the spectral type of cm  dra . unlike the original study , here we have made a special effort to match the rotational broadening of each component by convolving the spectrum of barnard s star ( assumed to have negligible rotation ) with a standard rotational profile .",

    "* ) , which might bias the mass determinations . the use of a template made from an observation of the star gj  725a ( m3.5v ) produced rather similar velocities , and an orbital solution with nearly identical elements and formal uncertainties only slightly higher than our previous fit .",
    "the minimum masses from this solution were smaller than our previous results by only 0.23% and 0.14% for the primary and secondary , respectively , which are below the formal errors in those quantities .",
    "a template from an observation of gj  51 ( m5.0v ) gave an orbital solution that was significantly worse , and minimum masses 0.67% and 0.72% higher than those from our reference fit .",
    "as a measure of the closeness of the match to the real components of cm  dra , we computed for each template the cross - correlation value from todcor averaged over all exposures . both of the alternate templates , which bracket the spectral type of cm  dra , gave average correlation values that were lower than we obtained with the gj  699 template ( particularly for gj  51 ) , indicating the match is not as good .",
    "the results using barnard s star are thus preferable , and the above tests indicate template mismatch is unlikely to be significant .",
    "the spotted nature of the cm  dra implies the possibility of systematic effects on the measured radial velocities that could bias the inferred masses and radii of the stars . in principle",
    "the wd code can approximately take into account these effects in solutions that use spectroscopic and photometric observations simultaneously , as long as those observations are contemporaneous .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case here , and as seen in table  [ tab : spots ] the properties of the spots change significantly with time . in order to at least provide an estimate of the effect ,",
    "we have performed experiments in which we perturbed the individual velocities by adding the radial - velocity corrections that wd computes for each of the spot configurations in table  [ tab : spots ] .",

    "the differences in the key parameters ( i.e. , the minimum masses @xmath53 , projected semimajor axis @xmath54 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath32 ) are always within the formal errors .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the individual velocity corrections are typically smaller than 0.2  . nevertheless , to be conservative , we have taken half of the maximum difference in each parameter as a measure of the possible systematic effect due to spots , and added this contribution in quadrature to the uncertainties determined from the analysis described in  [ sec : lc_rv ] .",

    "magnetic activity on the components of similar low - mass eb systems has often been proposed as an explanation for these discrepancies between models and observations ( see  [ sec : introduction ] ) .",

    "one manifestation of this activity is the presence of surface features ( spots ) that tend to block a fraction of the outgoing radiation .",

    "the first of these effects is equivalent to a reduction in the mixing length parameter ( @xmath155 ) , whereas the second can be parametrized in terms of the fractional spot coverage .",
    "the results show that for stars in the fully convective regime ( @xmath156  m@xmath157 ) the effect of a reduction in @xmath155 is minimal , while the presence of spots has a significant effect , and accounting for this can in fact reproduce the properties of cm  dra with a spot fraction of about 30% . for somewhat more massive stars theory predicts that both a reduced @xmath155 and spot coverage lead to similar effects on the global properties .",
    "although further observational and theoretical work is needed , these predictions appear at least qualitatively consistent with the findings of previous eb studies that suggest the radius discrepancies with the models are roughly 5% for stars with @xmath158  m@xmath157 , and about 10% for higher mass stars with convective envelopes .",
    "the implication is that in the former case the deviations are due only to spots , whereas for stars with radiative cores both spots and the reduction in the convection efficiency are important .",
    "a more detailed study of the relationship between activity and the radius discrepancies is underway by a subset of the present authors , including consistency checks with all observational constraints for late - type stars in binaries .",
    "this work will be presented in a forthcoming paper , placing cm  dra in context with the rest of the low - mass ebs .    the value of the apsidal motion found in ",
    "[ sec : tmin ] provides a different type of test of internal structure models since the rate of classical precession induced by tidal effects depends on the density profile of the stars . following the prescriptions in @xcite ,",
    "tidal apsidal motion is given by : @xmath159 where @xmath160 are coefficients that depend on the properties of each component , and @xmath161 are the internal structure constants dependent on the density profile .",
    "using the internal profile models of @xcite , we derive @xmath162 and @xmath163 for the primary and secondary components , respectively .",
    "these values yield @xmath164  deg  cycle@xmath87 .",
    "however , several more phenomena can contribute to the magnitude of the total apsidal motion , aside from the classical effects of tidal interaction .",
    "one is relativistic precession , which depends essentially on the masses and orbital period of the binary system .",
    "following the formula given by @xcite , and based on the properties derived here for cm  dra , the predicted effect is @xmath165  deg  cycle@xmath87 . combining the tidal and relativistic contributions",
    ", we obtain a theoretical value of the total apsidal motion of @xmath166  deg  cycle@xmath87 .",
    "this value is incompatible with the observed @xmath167  deg  cycle@xmath87 .",
    "the discrepancy is significant , at the 12-@xmath21 level .",
    "a third body may also alter the apsidal motion rate of the binary .",
    "interaction with the distant white dwarf companion needs in principle some consideration .",
    "the typical period of the apsidal motion resulting from a third - body perturbation is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : third_modulation ] .",
    "as described earlier , for the white dwarf cm dra companion this modulation period is about 2  gyr , thus the contribution of the white dwarf to the apsidal motion is completely negligible compared to the relativistic contribution , which has a much shorter period of @xmath54600  yr .",
    "there have been some claims of detections of low - mass companions orbiting cm  dra from analyses of the eclipse timings ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) , but the evidence so far does not seem compelling . as we discuss in  [ sec : third ] a third body may help to explain the small but signifincant eccentricity and remain undetected to via the light - time effect .",
    "given the possible range in mass and orbital period of such putative substellar object , we estimate that its contribution to the apsidal motion of cm  dra may be sufficient ( depending on the relative orbital inclination ) to explain the observed differences .",
    "note that scenario has been advocated to resolve the discrepancy found in the eclipsing binary di her @xcite .",
    "cm  dra has often been regarded in the past as a favorable system for inferring the primordial helium abundance , assuming that it is a population  ii star .",
    "@xcite described a method using polytropic stellar models that was followed by @xcite , who obtained bulk helium abundances of about 0.3 for both stars .",
    "these values are significantly higher than estimates using other methods .",
    "another analysis by @xcite led to a much lower value of 0.25 , through a comparison between their models and the physical properties of the cm  dra components reported by @xcite .",
    "those authors indicated , however , that for masses as low as those of cm  dra the models depend only weakly on the helium abundance .",
    "the present work shows that standard models are as yet unable to reproduce the observed values of @xmath16 and @xmath132 for the components of this binary at their measured masses .",
    "it would seem , therefore , that a determination of the helium abundance by comparison with model predictions ( or simpler polytropes ) is not particularly meaningful at the moment , given that the significant effects of activity on the global properties of these stars are not yet properly accounted for .",
    "prompted by significant improvements in eclipsing binary analysis methods since the most recent major photometric study by @xcite , and aided by new photometric observations gathered here to complement existing data , as well as improvements in the spectroscopy , we have conducted a thorough reanalysis of the classical low - mass double - lined eclipsing binary cm  dra .",
    "the goal has been to provide the best possible determinations of the physical properties to enable stringent tests of stellar theory .",
    "our results for the masses and radii of the stars , which we estimate to be about 4.1  gyr old , are @xmath0  m@xmath1 , @xmath2  m@xmath1 , @xmath3  r@xmath1 , and @xmath4  r@xmath1 , with formal relative uncertainties of only @xmath50.5% .",
    "a special effort has been made in this study to investigate possible sources of systematic error in these quantities and to assess their importance .",
    "we have performed a number of tests during the light - curve analysis , the spectroscopic analysis , and the determination of effective temperatures .",
    "the resulting uncertainties of these physical properties are thus believed to be realistic , and to offer the best opportunity for carrying out meaningful tests of models of stellar evolution and stellar structure for fully convective main - sequence stars .",
    "we find that the radii and temperatures of cm  dra show the same sort of discrepancy with model predictions as found previously for other low - mass ebs , which are at the level of @xmath557% in this particular case .",
    "mounting evidence indicates that such differences can be ascribed to magnetic activity effects .",
    "further research is underway to estimate the corrections needed in the models in order to reproduce the observations of low - mass ebs , given the prescriptions proposed by @xcite .",
    "measurements of the times of minimum for cm  dra clearly show the presence of apsidal motion in the system .",
    "however , its value is still poorly determined on account of observational errors , other errors due to distortions caused by spots , and the limited time coverage of the data .",
    "there also seems to exist a discrepancy bewteen the observational value and that derived from general relativity and tidal theory .",
    "a third body in the system , which may be responsible for the non - zero eccentricity , could provide an explanation to the observed difference .",
    "further measurements over the coming years will greatly help to constrain the precession of the line of apsides and separate the two effects more clearly , in addition to providing a better basis for investigating the possible presence of a third body in the system .",
