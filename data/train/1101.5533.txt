    "when two bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) collide at sufficiently high velocity , pairs of atoms are scattered out of the condensates . after many scattering events ,",
    "a distinct halo of atom pairs is formed in momentum space .",
    "this was observed in many experiments @xcite and analyzed in numerous theoretical works @xcite .",
    "the formation of a halo starts spontaneously and is analogous to the generation of photon pairs in parametric down conversion .",
    "such photon pairs were used to observe bell inequality violation @xcite , and can be applied for quantum cryptography @xcite or quantum teleportation @xcite . in analogy , atoms formed in the collision of two becs have a potential application for precision measurements @xcite , interferometry @xcite , or tests of quantum mechanics @xcite .    the simplest model that captures the formation of a halo in the condensate collision is the `` reduced bogoliubov '' model ( rbm ) . in this formulation , the two condensates",
    "counter - propagate at a constant relative velocity and without change of shape .",
    "the wave - packets enter in the bogoliubov equation for the field of scattered atoms as a classical source @xcite .",
    "the rbm can be used to calculate various observables , such as the density of scattered atoms or their second - order correlation functions , which can be directly compared with the experimental data .",
    "the predictions of the rbm are often in good agreement with experiment @xcite , but there are cases where more complete models have shown significant departures from the rbm @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compare results of the rbm and the complete bogoliubov equation for a range of parameters . in section [ meth ]",
    "we introduce both models and the numerical method of solving the equations of motion .",
    "two additional simplified formulations , also introduced in section [ meth ] , are used to investigate the properties of the halo .",
    "the dependence of the halo shape on the model is shown in section  [ eg1 ] for two characteristic cases , whereas sec .",
    "[ eg ] explains in detail the dependence of the halo position on the degree of simplifications made .",
    "we also indicate the range of interaction strength for which the rbm is quantitatively accurate .",
    "initially the gas is trapped by a harmonic potential . in order to start the ( half- ) collision ,",
    "a superposition of two counter - propagating , mutually coherent , atomic clouds of equal density is prepared by shining a bragg pulse .",
    "the trap is simultaneously turned off .",
    "the two fractions move apart with relative speed @xmath0 along the @xmath1 axis , where @xmath2 is the atomic recoil velocity . if the relative velocity is larger than the speed of sound at the condensate center , the collision is supersonic , superfluidity breaks down and a halo of scattered atoms is formed .",
    "the physical properties of this halo are the main subject of our studies . in our approach",
    "we model the process of the halo formation using a time dependent bogoliubov method , where the field operator is defined as @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the condensate wave function governed by the gp equation @xmath5 it is normalized to @xmath6  the number of atoms in the condensate , which remains undepleted during the dynamics .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath7 relates to the scattering length @xmath8 through @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a mass of an atom . the field operator @xmath11 describes the non - condensed atoms ( both the quantum depletion and the scattered halo ) and satisfies the following equation @xmath12 from this equation",
    ", we can trace back an effective bogoliubov hamiltonian :    [ heff]@xmath13    line ( [ heffkin ] ) stands for kinetic energy , while line ( [ heffmf ] ) results from the interaction of the condensate mean - field with the scattered atoms .",
    "finally ( [ heffpair ] ) describes the creation / annihilation process of pairs of non - condensed atoms .",
    "( 8,6.0 )    ( -0.15,3.0 )    ( 0.45,5.6 )    ( 2.8,5.8 )    ( 3.85,3.0 )    ( 4.45,5.6 )    ( -0.15,0.1 )    ( 0.45,2.7 ) ( 3.2,2.8 )    ( 3.85,0.1 )    ( 4.45,2.7 )    ( 3.8,-0.05)@xmath14    ( -0.2,2.85 )    most salient features of bec collisions are already found for the case of initially spherically symmetric condensates . before the numerical simulation of the collision",
    ", we find the condensate wave - function as a ground state of the gross - pitaevskii equation with harmonic trap of frequency @xmath15 , [ gp ] _ 0 ( ) = ( - ^2 + m^2 ^ 2 + g|_0()|^2)_0 ( ) .",
    "next , the trap is turned off and at the same time a set of bragg pulses is applied @xcite . in the center - of - mass frame , the initial state is then [ gpic ] ( , 0 ) = a_0 ( ) ( e^ik_0 z+e^-ik_0 z ) , where @xmath16 is the normalization constant and @xmath17 is the wave - vector associated with the recoil velocity .",
    "the initial state of the non - condensed part is taken to be a vacuum @xmath18 from this initial state the system evolves according to equations ( [ gpeq ] ) and ( [ bog ] ) .",
    "we point out that in our approximate description ( bogoliubov method ) , there is a universal scaling such that the non - condensed field @xmath19 is identical in all systems having the same value of @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 , where @xmath8 is a scattering length ) .",
    "hence the dynamics is described by the length scale @xmath21 rather than by the scattering length @xmath8 or the number of particles @xmath6 separately .",
    "other important length scales are @xmath22  the harmonic oscillator length , and @xmath23 . alternatively , since there is no trap for @xmath24 , we can use the width of the initial condensate @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 .",
    "if we apply the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite , a good choice of characteristic width @xmath25 is the thomas fermi radius @xmath27 . in conclusion : there are three relevant length scales , hence our system can be characterized by two dimensionless parameters .",
    "we choose : @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first parameter @xmath30 is independent of interactions and has a kinetic character .",
    "it can be viewed as the number of fringes created by the bragg pulses on the initial condensate , or as a ratio of the dispersion time scale , @xmath31 to the collision timescale , @xmath32 , see for instance @xcite . in realistic situations @xmath33 .",
    "the second parameter @xmath34 is proportional to the ratio of the interaction energy per particle @xmath35 to the kinetic energy per particle in the initial condensate @xmath36 .",
    "it is related to @xmath37 which has been used previously @xcite , but differs by a numerical factor : @xmath38 .",
    "the ratio between @xmath34 and @xmath30 quantifies the strength and nature of scattering .",
    "it has been shown that bose enhancement of scattering occurs for @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the bogoliubov equation ( [ bog ] ) can be solved numerically using the positive - p representation method @xcite , where the field operator @xmath40 is replaced with two complex - number fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is governed by a pair of stochastic ito equations ,    [ stabeq]@xmath43    here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are delta - correlated , independent , real stochastic noise fields with zero mean .",
    "the second moments are equal to @xmath46 numerically , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are approximated by real gaussian random variables of variance @xmath49 that are independent at each point at the computational lattice ( of volume @xmath50 ) , and at each time step of length @xmath51 .",

    "observables in k - space follow from the fourier transformation .",
    "for example , the one - particle density reads @xmath57    the stochastic equations ( [ stabeq ] ) strictly reproduce the full quantum dynamics described by @xmath58 when the number of samples tends to infinity . for finite sample sizes ,",
    "one obtains an estimator for the full quantum dynamics , with an uncertainty that is calculated by standard methods @xcite .",
    "a fortuitous `` side - effect '' of the method formulated above is the possibility to systematically add or remove parts of the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) and gp equation ( [ gpeq ] ) to understand their impact on the dynamics of the @xmath59 field .",
    "this includes a numerical simulation of the rbm.to do this , we first write the condensate wavefunction as a sum of left- and right - moving wavepackets , @xmath60 where @xmath61 with the gp equation    [ gpeqlr ] @xmath62    the terms proportional to the coupling constant @xmath7 can be interpreted as the self - interaction of the wavepacket ( [ gpeqlrbroad ] ) and cross - interaction between different wavepackets ( [ gpeqlrpush ] ) respectively .",
    "the remaining processes are in line ( [ gpeqlrintf ] ) .    next , the decomposition ( [ philr ] ) is put into the bogoliubov hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) giving    [ hefflr ] @xmath63    the resonant term ( [ hefflrpair ] ) governs the process where two atoms , one from @xmath64 and one from @xmath65 , collide and elastically scatter into the halo localized around the radius @xmath66 as in the usual rbm .",
    "the line ( [ hefflroffres ] ) leads to creation of two atoms in the @xmath59 field originating from one wave - packet , and we call this here `` on - condensate pairing '' .",
    "this incudes quantum depletion processes .",
    "note that the specific form of equations ( [ gpeqlr][hefflr ] ) allows for removal of chosen terms .",
    "this way , one can inspect their role in the dynamics of the system .",
    "cross - sections through the halo of scattered atoms along the @xmath67 axis after the end of the collision for @xmath68 * ( a ) * and @xmath69 * ( b)*. the curves are calculated using the models a ( red ) , b ( green ) , c ( black ) and d ( blue ) .",
    "triple lines indicate the best statistical estimate and the @xmath70 statistical uncertainties in the mean . ]    for instance , we can neglect all terms but the kinetic energy ( [ hefflrkin ] ) and pair production ( [ hefflrpair ] ) in the bogoliubov hamiltonian . this simplification we call the pair production ( pp ) dynamics . within this approximation",
    ", the positive p formulation takes the form :    [ reducedbogh ] @xmath71    we can also simplify the gp equation ( [ hefflr ] ) neglecting all the nonlinear terms and approximating the kinetic energy operator . as a result of this treatment",
    "we obtain the stiff movement ( sm ) of the counter - propagating wave - packets ,    [ reducedboggp ] @xmath72    the rbm , described in literature , consists of both the pp and sm simplifications . also , using alternative combinations of the approximations described above , we can generate four different models : +    a : :    gp equation ( [ gpeq ] ) + full bogoliubov ( [ stabeq ] ) b : :    sm ( [ reducedboggp ] ) recombined to ( [ philr ] ) + full bogoliubov    ( [ stabeq ] ) .",
    "c : :    sm ( [ reducedboggp ] ) + pp ( [ reducedbogh ] ) equation    @xmath73 we call it rbm d : :    gp equation ( reduced as in ( [ gpeqlr ] ) ) + pp ( [ reducedbogh ] ) equation .    in the following section we compare the distributions of scattered atoms obtained using the four above models .",
    "we first investigate the dynamics of the system in two characteristic cases , varying only @xmath34 , while @xmath74 is kept constant .",
    "it has been previously shown , that for gaussian colliding clouds , significant bose enhancement of scattering occurs when @xmath75 or greater , i.e. @xmath76 . figures [ big ] and [ small ] show the cross - section through the halo of scattered atoms in the @xmath77 plane at the end of the collision , for the case of appreciable ( @xmath68 ) and negligible ( @xmath69 ) bosonic enhancement of scattering .",
    "density profiles of the halo in these two cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - halo ] .    when the dynamics of the @xmath59 field is described by the simplified models c and d , the density of scattered atoms is spherically symmetric . on the other hand ,",
    "this symmetry is lost within models a and b , where the halo of atoms is weakened near the condensates .",
    "this effect can be attributed primarily to the mean field ( [ hefflrmf ] ) , with some enhancement resulting from ( [ hefflroffres ] ) .",
    "notice that for larger interaction strength  and consequently larger @xmath34",
    " these phenomena are more pronounced .",
    "moreover , models a and b predict some non - condensed atoms appearing on top of the becs ( in the same location as the becs ) .",
    "the latter effect results from the term ( [ hefflroffres ] ) only , and it as related to quantum depletion .      in the momentum space we denote location of the maximum of the halo density by @xmath78 .",
    "this parameter , briefly discussed in @xcite , varies between models a - d , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ big ] and [ small ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - halo ] in more detail .",
    "the shift of the position of the halo can be explained when the becs are modelled with two counter - propagating plane - waves @xcite , and using energy conservation argument .",
    "the energy of a particle released from the condensates depends on the form of the gp equation we use to describe it . the full gp equation , with @xmath79 - the mean density of the system , gives @xmath80 , while the sm ( [ reducedboggp ] ) gives a purely kinetic value @xmath81 .",
    "on the other hand the energy needed to place a particle in a noncondensed mode with momentum @xmath82 is equal to @xmath83 in the case of full bogoliubov and @xmath84 in the case of the pp equation ( [ reducedbogh ] ) .",
    "hence , using energy conservation we obtain    a : :    @xmath85 b : :    @xmath86 c : :    @xmath87 d : :    @xmath88    this simplified model gives quantitative agreement with the results presented in figure [ fig - halo ] .     dependence of the halo peak position @xmath78 on @xmath89 , calculated with a ( red circles ) , b ( green squares ) , c ( black triangles ) and d ( blue @xmath90 ) .",
    "error bars indicate the @xmath70 statistical uncertainties in the mean . ]",
    "notice that in all models @xmath91 is a linear function of the parameter @xmath92 . in order to generalize this dependence to the case of non - uniform condensates",
    ", we replace @xmath79 with half of the maximal density , which in the thomas - fermi approximation is @xmath93 . recalling the definitions of @xmath34 and @xmath30",
    ", we obtain the shift proportional to @xmath89 . to verify this conjecture , in fig.[fig - pos ]",
    "we plot @xmath94 as a function of @xmath89 for all four models .",
    "we observe that for growing @xmath89 ( and thus growing @xmath34 , as we keep constant @xmath74 ) , there is some deviation from the linear behaviour for models a and d. what these two models have in common is the full evolution of the condensates , which might make the picture of plane wave collisions with a time - independent density difficult to uphold .",
    "finally , we note that for small enough @xmath34 , the discrepancy between the rbm and full bogoliubov treatment is negligible , as expected .",
    "the region of agreement ( @xmath95 ) matches approximately the region where stimulated scattering ( bose enhancement ) is absent , although investigation with various values of @xmath30 would be necessary to confirm or refute a link .",
    "we have demonstrated how different approximations of the full bogoliubov equation dramatically influence the results of numerical simulations of bec collisions .",
    "although the simpliest rbm approach predicts a spherical density of scattered atoms , more involved models show significant discrepancies from this distribution .",
    "these differences can be understood as a result of the action of mean - field terms in the gp and bogoliubov equations . also , the position of the density maximum changes from model to model .",
    "this effect , which was investigated when the becs are approximated by the plane - waves , is here interpreted for non - uniform condensates .",
    "the rbm model is quantitatively correct when the interaction strength , as quantified by @xmath34 , is sufficiently small .",
