    "at first glance it may appear that the title of this contribution is somewhat unrelated to the main subject of this workshop .",
    "there are , however , several aspects concerning the physics of strong radio galaxies ( frii ) that may be relevant to the subject being discussed .",
    "first , one can mention the general question of the magnetic field strengths and of the energy deposited in relativistic particles in the lobes of radio galaxies .",
    "this has a direct bearing on the pressure balance with the ambient gas and , by inference , on the estimates of these quantities in the radio halos of galaxy clusters .",
    "a related aspect is the prediction of large fluxes of x - rays from the inverse compton ( ic ) process in the lobes of extended frii radio galaxies ; this may account for a sizeable fraction or all of the extended soft x - rays emission detected in the direction of frii s at large redshifts and generally attributed to the presence of surrounding hot intracluster gas . as a third point",
    "it is worth mentioning the possibility of obtaining important information on the intracluster gas properties from the interaction with the relativistic plasma in the lobes .",
    "we adopt the unification scheme linking frii radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars ( barthel , 1989 ) .",
    "then the radio lobes are flooded by the radiation from the hidden quasar , leading to very significant x - ray emission from the ic of the quasar s far / near ir photons with relativistic electrons having lorentz factors in the range 100300 ( brunetti , setti & comastri , 1997 ; hereafter paper i )",
    ". the energies of these electrons are much lower than those typically sampled by the synchrotron radio emission and , therefore , their presence must be assumed . however ,",
    "evidence that this might indeed be the case has been recently gathered by high angular resolution x - ray observations of 3c 219 with rosat - hri ( brunetti et al . , 1999 ;",
    "hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "in general magnetic field intensities in the radio lobes have been evaluated assuming the minimum energy condition ( equipartition ) . by convention",
    "this is based on the observed , and extrapoleted as required , synchrotron spectrum in the 10 mhz-100 ghz radio band ( source frame ) , involving electrons with @xmath0 in typical fields to be found in the lobes .",
    "only recently the detection of diffuse x - rays from the extended radio lobes of fornax a and cen b , interpreted as ic scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons ( cmb ) , has permitted an independent estimate of the ultra - relativistic electron ( @xmath0 ) densities with the conclusion that the energy in the relativistic particles , the energy densities of positive and negative charges being equal , exceeds that in the magnetic fields ( kaneda et al.1995 ; tashiro et al.1998 ) . the departure from the equipartition would be further enhanced with increasing ratio of the energy density in positive charges ( protons ) to that in the electron component .",
    "of course , there is no basic reason why the equipartition argument should strictly apply , except that it minimizes the energy requirements .",
    "since the ic production of ( soft ) x - rays from the scattering of the hidden quasar ir photons requires relativistic electrons of much lower energies , it is convenient ( and in any case more correct ) to work out the minimum energy condition based on a low energy cut - off ( @xmath1 ) in the electron energy distribution ( paper i ) .",
    "ionization losses may provide a natural mechanism to obtaining a low energy break in the particle spectra . under the assumption that the particle energy distribution follows a power law with exponent @xmath2 and that particles and fields are uniformely and isotropically distributed ,",
    "one finds that the equipartition field is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the equipartition field computed with standard formulae ( pacholczyk , 1970 ) .",
    "( the ratio between particles and fields energy densities depends on the spectral slope , being 1 for @xmath5 and the classical 4/3 for @xmath6 ) . for @xmath7 , @xmath8 if @xmath9 , a condition always satisfied in the radio lobes . with @xmath10 in the range",
    "0.81.0 it is found that @xmath11 is typically comprised in the range 1.5  3.0 , depending on @xmath1 and on @xmath4 .",
    "correspondingly the normalization of the electron spectrum is decreased by at least a factor 2 , or larger , an effect that should be taken into account in computing the ic emission expected on the basis of the equipartition value , whereas the ratios of the total energy densities and of the pressures ( particles plus fields ) is increased by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "the last point is of particular importance not only for the evaluation of the minimum energy stored in the radio volumes , but even more so in any discussion concerning the pressure balance with the surroundig intergalactic gas .",
    "for instance , by applying the conventional equipartition relationships it has been found ( feretti , perola & fanti , 1992 ) that radio tails are underpressurized by factors 5  10 compared with the hot confining intracluster gas . by considering , as an example , the sources with the weakest equipartition fields ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 , we find that the tail internal pressure should be increased by a factor @xmath15",
    ". this may not fully solve the problem of the pressure balance for the large sample of sources considered by these authors , but it certainly alleviates the need of strong departures from the equipartition and/or the assumption of large ratios between relativistic nuclei and electrons .",
    "3c 219 is a well known powerful double - lobed frii radio galaxy , identified with a cd galaxy at a redshift z = 0.174 ( clarke et al .",
    "1992 and ref . therein ) .",
    "the total projected size is @xmath16 460 kpc ( 180 arcsec ) ; it has a strong jet protruding in the direction of the south - western lobe with a projected size @xmath16 50 kpc ; its radio spectrum , largely dominated by the extended structures , is a typical power law with spectral index @xmath17 = 0.81 in the 178750 mhz interval . from the combined analysis of rosat - pspc and asca archival data",
    "we have concluded ( paper ii ) that the 0.1 - 10 kev emission spectrum of 3c 219 can be best represented by a partially ( @xmath18 ) absorbed power law ( photon index @xmath19 , absorption column density @xmath20 @xmath21 ) .",
    "this could be interpreted as indicating a two component model : an absorbed nuclear source , with a spectrum typical of steep spectrum radio- loud quasars , and a scattered component contributing @xmath22 of the total flux in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy interval and with a spectral index @xmath23 , close to the spectral slope measured in the radio band .",
    "in addition , from the spectral analysis we were able to exclude any thermal component contributing more than 10% to the total flux in the rosat band .",
    "the above scenario has been largely confirmed by a subsequent deep rosat hri ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) observation as described in paper ii .",
    "the x - ray image of 3c 219 is dominated by a point - like source coincident , within the positional errors , with the radio core ( nucleus ) of the galaxy , but a diffuse component extending up to the hundred kpc scale is also present . taking into account the results of the spectral anlysis",
    "we find that the point - like source accounts for @xmath24 of the total net counts , while its de - absorbed isotropic luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band is @xmath25 erg s@xmath26 , thus strengthening the suggestion that we are dealing with the emission of a quasar hidden in the nucleus of the galaxy in agreement with the unification scheme .",
    "the distribution of the extended emission after subtraction of the point - like source is shown in fig.1 superposed on the vla radio image at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the striking result is the very close coupling between the x - ray and the radio images .",
    "one can distinguish three main components : the central component ( c ) , which accounts for @xmath2750% of the extended flux and appears more elongated in the northern direction along the bottom part of the northern radio lobe , the south component ( s ) , located mid way between the nucleus and the southern hot - spot , and the northern component ( n ) .",
    "it is also striking that the x - ray isophotes appear to carefully avoid the regions of the hot - spots .    since we know from the spectral analysis that the x - ray spectrum up to 10 kev has a slope very close to that measured in tha radio band , it is tempting to associate the x - ray emission to the ic process involving the relativistic electrons in the radio lobes .",
    "if so , the emission of component c , whose brightness distribution falls off roughly as the inverse distance from the nucleus , must be dominated by the ic scattering of the ir photons from the hidden quasar with relatively low energy electrons ( @xmath28 ) . by considering various observational upper limits and the correlations linking ir , optical , radio and x - ray radiation properties of quasars and radio galaxies ,",
    "we have estimated that the isotropic 6 - 100 @xmath29 luminosity of the hidden quasar could be @xmath30 erg s@xmath26 , about an order of magnitude less than that of a _ typical _ radio - loud quasar ( see the next section ) .",
    "we have also included in the photon bath of the electrons the cmb radiation .",
    "we have then constructed an ic model of the source taking into account the following constraints and assumptions :    @xmath31 assume a uniform distribution of the relavistic electrons throughout the source and the power law energy spectrum of the radio electrons ( @xmath32 ) extrapolated downward to a @xmath33 ;    @xmath31 consider the radiation from the hidden quasar , as seen by the electrons , made of two components : a direct radiation within two opposite cones of half - opening angle 45 deg and that re - radiated by the surrounding dusty torus ;    @xmath31 assume , according to bridle et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , that the radio jet makes an angle of 30 deg with respect to the plane of the sky ;    @xmath31 let the orientation of the torus axis be a free parameter subject to the constraint that the inner part of component c appears to be elongated in a direction making a large angle with the radio jet ( fig.1 ) and that the line of sight to the quasar must intercept the torus .    -0.5 cm",
    "-0.5 cm    the results of our model computations are shown in fig.2 for the case in which the torus axis makes an angle of @xmath16 37 deg with the radio jet and one of @xmath1673 deg with the line of sight .",
    "clearly the model reproduces fairly well the main features of component c , including the extension of the brightness distribution toward the northern lobe due to the dominance of nearly front scatterings in the far lobe in the observer s direction ( as discussed in paper i ) .",
    "the observed flux densities , however , can only be matched under the assumption that the electron density exceeds the equipartition value ( the particle energy density being equally shared among the electrons and the nuclei ) by about a factor 10 , the corresponding magnetic field strength being @xmath34 . a similarly strong departure from the equipartion has been proposed by tashiro et al.(1998 ) to explain the x - ray emission from cen b.    we have considered the possibility , also in view of the cluster membership of 3c 219 , that component c could be the result of a non - symmetric cooling flow .",
    "the main point here is that a cooling flow model implies a thermal contribution far in excess ( at least an order of magnitude ) of the upper limit set by the spectral analysis within 2 arcmin radius from the source and , in addition , a cluster emission exceeding the rosat hri background .",
    "we conclude that at this stage our ic model represents the most solid interpretation of component c , providing at the same time strong supportive evidence in favour of the unification scheme linking frii radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , if the ic interpretation holds , then the observed coincidence of the x - ray and radio spectral slopes implies a sufficiently uniform distribution of particles ( with the same spectrum ) and fields throughout the source .",
    "our model is unable to explain the s and n components without introducing significant changes in the basic assumptions .",
    "for instance , both components can be accounted for by the ic mechanism ( mainly from up - scattering of cmb photons ) if one is prepared to admit an increase of a factor 2 - 2.5 in the density of the relativistic electrons at the location of the two components .",
    "an inspection of the radio maps , including the spectral index distribution and polarization , reveals that both components are located in regions where there is an indication of back - flows from the hot - spots .",
    "it is also possible that there is a thermal contribution due to a hot ( @xmath35 kev ) and clumpy intracluster gas surrounding the radio source in localized regions .",
    "this is particularly true for the s component whose almost precise coincidence with a region of moderate depolarization is striking .",
    "the nature of the emission of these components may soon be clarified by upcoming observations of 3c 219 with _",
    "we briefly report here on a previous work on six strong frii s ( 3c 277.2 , 280 , 294 , 324 , 356 , 368 ) at large distances ( z @xmath36 0.7  1.8 ) which had been detected by rosat pspc / hri and discussed in published papers ( paper i and ref . therein ) . these sources show direct or indirect evidence of extended emission , but appear very weak typically contributing only several tens of net counts after long exposure times , so that also their spectra are in general poorly constrained .",
    "the main steps of our procedures were as follows :    @xmath31 derive a _",
    "typical _ quasar ir - optical spectrum ( 100 @xmath29 - 350 @xmath37 ) and the corresponding ( isotropic ) luminosity @xmath38 erg s@xmath26 ( @xmath39 -26.1 ) typical of high redshift radio - loud quasars ;    @xmath31 for each source assume a relativistic particle power law spectrum from the synchrotron radio emission extrapolated downward to a lorentz factor @xmath1 = 20 and derive the equipartion field for equal energy density of relativistic electrons and protons ;    @xmath31 compute the hidden quasar luminosity required to match the observed x - ray flux of each source by the ic scattering of the quasar photons emitted within two opposite cones of half opening angle 45 deg coaxial with the radio axis , including possible corrections due to enhanced anisotropic ic emission toward the observer for the ( unknown ) inclination of the radio axis on the plane of the sky and taking into account the ic x - rays from the scattering of the cmb photons ( non negligeable at these large redshifts ) .",
    "we have concluded that the soft x - ray luminosities and spectra of five sources could be satisfactorely explained by our model , with the exception of 3c 324 for which there is independent evidence that the emission is due to a hot intracluster gas .",
    "three radio galaxies ( 3c 277.2 , 280 , 368 ) require a hidden quasar of _ typical _ luminosity ; in particular , for 3c 277.2 we derived a v magnitude in very good agreement with that obtained by manzini & di serego alighieri ( 1996 ) to explain the optical spectropolarimetric data . for the remaining two radio galaxies ( 3c 294 , 356 ) the required hidden quasar luminosities are larger than _ typical _ ( 1 - 1.5 magnitude brighter ) , but consistent with the indication inferred from spectral and polarimetric data .",
    "the detection of extended x - ray emission from the frii radio galaxy 3c 219 can be best interpreted as ic scattering of the ir radiation emitted by a quasar , hidden in the nucleus of the galaxy , with the relativistic electrons residing in the lobes .",
    "this implies an extension of the electron spectrum to energies much lower than those of the synchrotron electrons and a substantial departure from the equipartition , that is a factor @xmath40 more energy in particles than in the magnetic fields .",
    "this result provides further support to the unification scheme linking friis and radio - loud quasars .",
    "the soft x - ray fluxes of five strong friis at large redshifts can also be accounted for as ic scattering of the hidden quasar ir photons with the relativistic electrons in the radio lobes : under equipartition conditions the required luminosities of the quasars are very reasonable and consistent with spectral and polarization data analysis when available .",
    "this also implies that for such distant objects one should be careful in ascribing the observed x - ray emission to a different origin , such as a hot intracluster gas in which these sources might be embedded .",
    "the equipartition values referred to in our analysis have been obtained by extrapolating the synchrotron electron spectra downward to a minimum cut - off energy , implying equipartition fields that are significantly stronger than those derived by the conventional equipartition relationships .",
    "it follows that the total energy and internal pressure in the radio emitting regions could be much larger than usually estimated .",
    "this should be taken into account while discussing the pressure balance for the confinement of the radio volumes .",
