    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are violent phenomena in the universe , which radiate tremendous energy about @xmath0 ergs from fractions of a second to tens of seconds .",
    "the widely accepted model is the fireball shock model ( goodman 1986 ; rees & mszros 1992 , 1994 ; mszros & rees 1992 ; piran 1999 ) . in this model",
    ", it is believed that the electrons are accelerated by internal shocks or external shocks .",
    "internal shocks are likely developed near the site of optically thin fireball ( rees & mszros 1994 ) , which give birth to the prompt emission due to collisions of shells with each other .",
    "soon after the burst , the relativistic ejecta continue to spread out to form an external shock .",
    "the external shock sweeps up interstellar medium ( blandford & mckee 1976 ; piran et al .",
    "1993 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is believed to produce x - ray , optical / ir and radio emission , i.e. the afterglow .",

    "2004 ) , which was launched by nasa on november 20 , 2004 , opened a new era for grbs researches .",
    "the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) ( burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) onboard the _ swift _ has detected several hundreds of x - ray afterglows and the results are fruitful ( mzros 2006 ; zhang 2007 ) . in the summarization of the x - ray afterglow data ,",
    "a canonical x - ray afterglow light curve includes five components ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "these five components include the steep decay phase ( zhang et al . 2007 ; zhang et al . 2009 ) , the shallow decay phase ( liang et al .",
    "2007 ) , the normal decay phase ( willingale et al . 2007 ) , the post - jet break phase ( liang et al . 2008 ) and x - ray flares ( burrows et al . 2005a ; dai et al . 2006 ) , respectively . for many bursts",
    ", we do not observe all components simply because of inadequate observations .",
    "lots of samples only consist of single - power component ( liang et al .",

    "different samples show different temporal structures , increasing our perplexity .",
    "meanwhile , li et al . (",
    "2012 ) had systematically decomposed the optical afterglow light curves , indicating that the structures and composition of the optical afterglows were more complex than the x - ray afterglows .    for x - ray afterglows ,",
    "the shallow decay phase is still a puzzle ( zhang 2007 ) .",
    "the broadband afterglows , which usually decay as a power - law function of time with an index of @xmath1 ( normal decay phase ) , are believed to be associated with the external shock . if the external shocks are refreshed by continuous energy injection into the blast wave , a shallow decay phase prior to the normal decay phase could be observed .",
    "the shallow decay may be due to the following mechanisms : ( i ) energy injection invoking a long - term central engine ( dai & lu 1998 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) , ( ii ) late internal shock model ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; zou et al .",

    "2006 ) , ( iv ) central engine model ( kumar et al . 2008",
    "; geng et al .",
    "2013 ) . to determine which one of these models is correct ,",
    "we need more observational data .    a quite long plateau followed by a very late rebrightening is observed in the afterglow of grb 120326a in x - ray and optical bands , which is observed for the first time .",

    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "the x - ray light curve has a steep decay , of which the decay index is about 3.4 and it lasts from 52 s to 268 s after the bat trigger .",
    "then there is a data gap until about @xmath26 s due to the first earth occultation .",
    "a plateau emerges in the second orbit observation ( or maybe before it ) and ends at about 20 ks after the bat trigger . after the plateau",
    ", the light curve shows a rebrightening which peaks at about 30 ks - 40 ks after the bat trigger with the rising slope @xmath27 2.22 .",

    ", we can see the optical afterglow light curve is composed of three parts : a decay from about 100 s to 1000s , a plateau from about 1000 s to 10 ks ( may be more longer ) , and a brightening from 10 ks to dozens of thousands seconds .",
    "the detailed optical data are listed in table 1 .    at early stage of afterglow",
    ", the x - ray shows a steep decay which is to be due to the curvature effect from the internal shock and the optical band shows a normal decay from the forward external shock .",
    "optical and x - ray light curves in the late stage are very similar , though there may be a color evolution during the rebrightening ( kuin et al .",
    "2012 ) . due to their similar shapes",
    ", they may be of the same origin .",
    "the shallow decay phase is often observed in x - ray and optical afterglows ( liang et al .",
    "the temporal decay slope is about 0.5 , which is flatter than the temporal slope of normal decay ( @xmath32 1.2 ) .",
    "the slope of shallow decay can not be explained by the standard afterglow model ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is difficult to understand .",
    "for some bursts , no spectral evolution is observed during the phase transition , which rules out the crossing of spectral break frequencies in the observing band ( zhang 2007 ) .",
    "the energy injection model is still a preferred model to explain the shallow decay phase . in the framework of the fireball shock model ,",
    "all the shells merge into a thick shell which continues to move forward and interact with the surrounding medium to form the external shock after the prompt emission .",
    "the external shock accelerates electrons to relativistic speed .",
    "so a fraction of shock energy will be transported to the swept - up medium as internal energy .",
    "the synchrotron radiation from the relativistic electrons contribute to the afterglow in x - ray , optical and radio bands .",
    "but after the prompt emission , a new born millisecond pulsar ( or black hole ) with strong magnetic field and rapid rotation can be born .",
    "it can produce a poynting - flux - dominated wind ( dai & lu 1998 ) . the strong poynting flow can be injected directly into the external shock and its energy might be much larger than the initial energy of the external shock .",
    "this so - called energy injection process is used to interpret the plateau or `` bump '' features in x - ray and optical afterglow light curves .      a generic dynamical model of grb outflows",
    "was proposed by huang et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) , and it had been widely used to calculate the afterglow light curves . recently ,",
    "the effects of some subtle factors such as the adiabatic pressure and radiative losses on the dynamics were further studied ( van eerten et al .",
    "2010 ; peer 2012 ; nava et al .",
    "2013 ) . when poynting - flux energy injection is taken into account , the basic equation for grb outflow dynamics during the afterglow phase can be modified as ( also see kong & huang 2009 ; liu et al .",
    "2010 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the bulk velocity and lorentz factor of the shocked medium , @xmath36 is the mass of the swept - up surrounding medium by the shock , @xmath37 is the beaming factor of the grb outflows , @xmath38 is the half - opening angle of the jet , @xmath39 is the initial mass of the jet , @xmath40 is the radiative efficiency , @xmath30 is the radius , @xmath41 is the speed of light , and @xmath42 is the luminosity of the additional energy injection into the forward shock .    if the central engine is a magnetar , the poynting flux power evolves with time as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the initial luminosity at @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the characteristic spin - down timescale .",

    "the afterglow photons mainly come from synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated by the external shock ( sari et al .",

    ", there are two types of medium surrounding the massive star : homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) type and wind type .",
    "liang et al . ( 2013 ) argued that the medium surrounding some grbs evolved from the wind case to the ism case at certain radius .",
    "however , yi et al . ( 2013 ) suggested that the environment was neither a wind case nor a ism case . for simplicity",
    ", we use the wind + energy injection model and the ism + energy injection model to calculate the afterglow , respectively .    in the wind case , the typical synchrotron frequency , the cooling frequency and the maximum peak flux density are @xmath69 hz , @xmath70 hz , and @xmath71 @xmath72jy , where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is shock energy equipartition parameter for magnetic fields , @xmath75 is the wind parameter ( the number density of the wind is @xmath76 @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 is the luminosity distance @xmath79 in units of @xmath80 cm , and @xmath81 is the initial isotropic kinetic energy @xmath82 in units of @xmath83 ergs . taking the energy injection power as @xmath84 ( so @xmath85 ) , then the typical synchrotron frequency scales as @xmath86 , the synchrotron cooling frequency scales as @xmath87 , and the the peak flux density @xmath88 ( zhang et al .",

    "in the ism case , the typical synchrotron frequency , the cooling frequency and the maximum peak flux density are @xmath94 hz , @xmath95 hz , and @xmath96 @xmath72jy , respectively , where @xmath97 is the density of the circumburst environment . assuming the energy injection power as @xmath84 , then the typical synchrotron frequency scales as @xmath86 , the synchrotron cooling frequency scales as @xmath98 , and the the peak flux density scales as @xmath99 ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) . here",
    ", the synchrotron radiation flux density at the observing frequency @xmath89 can also be described by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the energy injection should be carried out within a period of time , starting from @xmath100 and ending at @xmath101 . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider a constant injection luminosity , i.e. , @xmath102 combining eq.(4 ) and eq.(1 ) , we can calculate the evolution of the external shock subjecting to the energy injection from a strongly magnetized millisecond pulsar . following the procedure described in huang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we can calculate both x - ray and optical afterglows using any set of model parameter values .",
    "besides , our numerical code has also included the effect of equal arrival time surface ( eats , see huang et al .",
    "2007 ) and the effect of synchrotron self - absorption by electrons which might be important for optical emission during the early phase ( wu et al . 2003 ) .    here",
    ", we respectively analyze the afterglow light curves in the wind and ism model :    _ in the wind model : _ we investigate the effects of the wind parameter @xmath75 , the starting time @xmath100 and ending time @xmath101 of energy injection , and the injection luminosity @xmath44 on the light curves of the afterglow through numerical calculations . to explore the effect of one of the above model parameters",

    "the typical values adopted for the remaining model parameters of the afterglow are @xmath108 , @xmath109 ergs , @xmath110 rad , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the initial lorentz factor of the jet . with these parameters ,",
    "we calculate the afterglow light curves under different conditions , as shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "we briefly describe the effects of the different parameters on the x - ray light curves .",
    "figure 3a shows the light curves for different wind parameter @xmath75 .",
    "we set the @xmath115 30 ks . when @xmath75 is 0.05 , the peak time of the `` bump '' is about 3 ks , while when @xmath75 is 0.2 , the peak time of the `` bump '' is about 10 ks . for a smaller @xmath75 ,",
    "the peak time is earlier and the peak flux is larger .",
    "in addition , the peak time is always less than @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath75 is small enough , there will be a plateau / shallow decay after the peak of the `` bump''(e.g .",
    ", @xmath75 = 0.1 ) .",
    "when @xmath75 is large enough , there will be a shallow decay prior to the peak ( e.g. , @xmath116 ) .",
    "these phenomena reveal that the wind parameter @xmath75 determines the peak time of the `` bump '' .",
    "it also proves that the medium density plays a very important role in shaping the afterglow light curves in the energy injection model .",
    "the calculated light curve showing early shallow decay and late narrow `` bump''/rebrightening is a novel prediction by the energy injection model with a wind - type environment . as we will show in the next subsection",
    ", such a specific model can interpret the peculiar x - ray and optical afterglows of grb 120326a quite well .",
    "@xmath101 affects the duration of the plateau / shallow decay as well as the late - time x - ray flux .",
    "when @xmath101 is larger than the peak time which is determined by @xmath75 , the light curve will show a `` shallow decay '' or `` plateau '' from the peak time to @xmath101 , as shown in figure 3b .",
    "this is understandable because a larger @xmath101 corresponds to more energy injected into the external shock .",
    "figure 3c shows to the effect of the energy injection starting time @xmath100 .",
    "we find that the later the energy injection begins , the more obvious the rebrightening will be .",
    "this is in fact the zero - time effect .",
    "we also note that the @xmath100 affects the peak time and the peak flux of the `` bump '' .",
    "the later @xmath100 is ( the less the energy is injected into the external shock ) , the later the peak time will be , and the smaller the peak flux will be .",
    "figure 3d shows the effect of the energy injection luminosity @xmath44 . from the figure 3d , we can see that an obvious rebrightening is positively correlated with the @xmath44 .",
    "the larger the injection luminosity is ,",
    "the more obvious the rebrightening can be .",
    "the parameter effects on the optical afterglow light curves ( fig .",
    "4 ) are quite similar to those on the corresponding x - ray light curves .    _ in the ism model : _ similar to the wind model , we study the effects of the density of the circumburst environment @xmath97 , the starting time @xmath100 and ending time @xmath101 of energy injection , and the injection luminosity @xmath44 on the light curves of the afterglow through numerical calculations too .",
    "when we study the effect of one of the above model parameters , we take the standard parameters as @xmath117 @xmath118 , @xmath104 s , @xmath106 ks , and @xmath107 erg s@xmath53 , respectively .",
    "we find that although the light curve is also affected by these parameters , there is not a `` bump '' at the late time in the light curve which is like the shape of grr 120326a ( see fig . 5 and 6 , corresponding to x - ray and optical light curves , respectively ) .",
    "in same case , when the starting time @xmath100 is relatively later and the injection luminosity @xmath44 is relatively larger , there is also a wide bump .",
    "but it is very similar to grb 121027a ( wu et al . 2013 ) and is different from grb 120326a ( see fig .",
    "more detailed analysis can also be found in geng et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the long plateau and a very late rebrightening of grb 120326a in x - ray and optical bands at the same time are almost an ideal template for testing the energy injection + wind model .",
    "this case may help us to reveal the details of the underlying energy injection and circum - burst environment .",
    "note that we only consider the forward shock emission as in our modeling and assume the injection energy is purely in the form of poynting flux .    for the normal afterglows in the non - injection cases ,",
    "the model parameters can be roughly estimated from the analytical results according to the multi - band observations ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2013 ) . however , in grb 120326a , it is unable to constrain all the parameters analytically from the light curves only in two bands .",
    "in fact , the energy injection process will even make the justification more difficult since the evolution of @xmath119 and @xmath120 also depends on the injection luminosity . in our model , there are ten parameters .",
    "we set some parameters as the typical values ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ; wu et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath121 , @xmath113 , @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath121 is consistent with the photon index of 1.89 of the spectrum from 3700 s to 80 ks if @xmath122 .",
    "we set the half - opening angle a typical value too : @xmath38 = 0.05 rad ( frail et al . 2001 ; lu et al .",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath114 are estimated from section 2.1 .",
    "the plateau of the optical light curve indicates that the injection starting time is around 600 s though the data seems scattering , thus we set @xmath124 s. on the basis of the rebrightening of optical and x - ray light curve , we set @xmath101 @xmath125 30 ks .",
    "when @xmath75 is large enough , there will be a shallow decay prior to the peak .",
    "these phenomena reveal that the wind parameter @xmath75 determines the peak time of the `` bump '' , which is discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "grb 120326a is just an example of this case . through the @xmath101",
    "@xmath125 30 ks , we can get the @xmath75 @xmath126 0.4 .",
    "then there are only two parameter @xmath44 and @xmath75 , which need to be determined by fitting the observations .",
    "there is a relatively large scattering in the plateau phase of the optical data , which makes it difficult for us to search the best parameters during the parameter space .",
    "note that we want to address in this article is the origin of the plateau and rebrightening in grb 120326a .",
    "after some trials , the rough fitting result is shown in figure 2 , in which @xmath127 erg s@xmath53 and @xmath75 = 0.45 are adopted .",
    "two points should be emphasized in the fitting process : first , we only consider the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands optical data and the unfiltered band data are only used for reference .",
    "second , we are mainly concerned with the plateau and rebrightening stage .",
    "figure 7 shows the evolution of @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath128 with time .",
    "the left panel of figure 7 shows that the evolution of these two frequencies differs slightly from the analytical ones since there exists a transition period from the non - injection case to the full injection case .",
    "this kind of evolution rests with the evolution of @xmath128 given in the right panel of figure 7 .",
    "this difference finally results in the small bump during the energy injection .",
    "the same reason will also hold for the rising segment in the optical afterglow .",
    "note that there is a steep rise for @xmath119 after @xmath129 , it is caused by synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) scattering between the photons and electrons and will have an obvious effect near @xmath119 = @xmath120 ( sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "however , this steep rise could not be responsible for the observed bump since it is after the peak time ( @xmath130 s ) .",
    "grb 120326a is an unusual grb , which shows a quite long plateau and a very late rebrightening in x - ray and optical bands at the same time .",
    "the similar shape in x - ray and optical bands of grb 120326a suggests the same origin for them .",
    "the long plateau starts at several hundred seconds and ends at tens of thousands seconds .",
    "the peak time of the late rebrightening is about 30000 s. because of such a curious phenomenon , a lot of telescopes did the follow - up observations of this grb .",
    "we collect a lot of observational data , having early and late afterglow data to deepen our understanding of the energy injection mechanism .",
    "plateaus and rebrightenings / bumps in grb afterglow light curves usually hint late reactivity of the grb central engine ( dai & lu 1998 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; geng et al .",
    "however , it is rare that two phenomena take place in one grb . in this study",
    ", we consider a new born millisecond pulsar with strong magnetic field as the central engine ( dai & liu 2012 ) .",
    "zhang and yan ( 2011 ) also suggested that the central engine could produce a poynting - flux dominated outflow . due to the strong magnetic field and rapid rotation ,",
    "the new born millisecond pulsar can release the energy comparable to that of the impulsive energy of the initial fireball .",
    "in this case , the very early afterglow may be directly powered by ultra - relativistic mildly magnetized outflows ( fan et al .",
    "it is also very possible that the continuous energy release by the pulsar will be injected into the external shock driven by the initial jet , which is currently the standard scenario for afterglow plateaus .",
    "we analyze the energy injection model by means of numerical and analytical solutions , considering both the wind scenario and ism scenario .",
    "the influence of the injection starting time , ending time , stellar wind density ( or density of the circumburst environment ) , and injection luminosity on the shape of the afterglow light curves are explored .",
    "we find that the light curve of the afterglow is largely affected in the wind model by the parameters .",
    "we also find that although the light curve is slightly affected in the ism case by these parameters , there is a significant `` bump '' at the late time only in the wind model .",
    "for different grbs , the circumburst environment ( wind parameter @xmath75 ) , the luminosity ( @xmath131 ) and duration ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) of the energy injection may vary markedly .",
    "this may be one possible explanation to the observed diverse afterglow light curves . from figure 3a and 4a ,",
    "we show that the plateau and the late bump is an indicator of a wind type circumburst environment .",
    "grb 120326a with such temporal behavior is an ideal template .",
    "our results suggest that the circumburst environment of grb 120326a is very likely a stellar wind . with reasonable parameter values",
