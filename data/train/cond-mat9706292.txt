    "it is well known that magnetic ordering is an essentially quantum phenomenon . according to the bohr  van leeven theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the magnetization of a thermodynamically equilibrium classical system of charged particles is zero even in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "classical theories of magnetic properties were based on certain assumptions going beyond the limits of classical physics ( e.g. , the existence of stable micro - particles with nonzero magnetic moment assumed in langevin s theory of paramagnetism @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of magnetic ordering was revealed only after the discovery of modern quantum mechanics in the works of heisenberg , frenkel and dorfman . in 30s , many remarkable results were obtained within the microscopic quantum theory : bloch @xcite predicted the existence of magnons and low - temperature behavior of magnetization ; bethe @xcite was able to construct the complete set of excited states for a spin-@xmath0 chain , including nonlinear soliton - type excitations ( spin complexes ) .",
    "the ` undivided rule ' of the quantum theory of magnetism lasted only till 1935 , when in the well - known work landau and lifshitz @xcite formulated the equation describing the dynamics of macroscopic magnetization of a ferromagnet ( fm ) . when deriving the landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation ,",
    "a quantum picture of magnetic ordering was used , particularly , the exchange nature of spin interaction , but the ll equation itself has the form of a classical equation for the magnetization @xmath1 . later on the basis of the ll equation the macroscopic theory of magnetism was developed and enormous number of various phenomena were described @xcite ( an overview of modern phenomenological theory of magnetically ordered media can be also found in this book in the lecture by v.g.baryakhtar ) .",
    "this lecture presents an introduction to the foundations of a new , fast - developing topic in the physics of magnetism , macroscopic quantum tunnelling ( mqt ) .",
    "let us first address briefly the scope of problems belonging to this field .",
    "mqt problems can be roughly divided into two main types .",
    "first of all , there are phenomena connected with the underbarrier transition from a metastable state , corresponding to a local minimum of the magnet energy , to a stable one",
    ". such effects were observed in low - temperature remagnetization processes in small fm particles as well as in macroscopic samples ( due to the tunneling depinning of domain walls ) , see the recent review @xcite .",
    "such phenomena of `` quantum escape '' are typical not only for magnets , e.g. , quantum depinning of vortices contributes significantly to the energy losses in htsc materials @xcite .    here",
    "we will concentrate on another type of phenomena , the so - called _ coherent mqt . _ to illustrate their main feature , let us consider a small fm particle with the easy axis along the @xmath2 direction . if the particle size is small enough ( much less than the domain wall thickness @xmath3 )",
    ", the particle is in a single - domain state , because the exchange interaction makes the appearance of a state with magnetic inhomogeneities energetically unfavorable .",
    "then , from the point of view of classical physics , the ground state of the particle is twofold degenerate .",
    "those two states correspond to two local minima of the anisotropy energy and are macroscopically different since they have different values of macroscopic magnetization @xmath4 .",
    "the situation is the same as in the elementary mechanical problem of a particle in two - well potential @xmath5 having equivalent minima at @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : two - well ] . in classical mechanics",
    "the minimum of energy corresponds to a particle located in one of the two local minima of the potential .",
    "however , from quantum mechanics textbooks it is well known that the actual situation is _ qualitatively _ different : the particle is `` spread '' over two wells , and the ground state is nondegenerate @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the same should be true for a fm particle : its correct ground state will be a superposition of `` up '' and `` down '' states , and the mean value of magnetization will be zero .",
    "such picture was first proposed by chudnovsky @xcite ; further calculations showed @xcite that such effects are possible for fm particles with rather large number of spins ( about @xmath7 ) .",
    "the tunneling effects , according to the theoretical estimates @xcite , should be even more important for small particles of antiferromagnet ( afm ) ; the effects of quantum coherence in afm particles were observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus , an important feature of quantum mechanics , a possibility of underbarrier transitions , can manifest itself in magnetic particles on a macroscopic ( strictly speaking , mesoscopic ) scale .",
    "maybe even more interesting is the manifestation of another characteristic feature of quantum physics , viz .",
    "the effects of quantum interference .",
    "such effects arise in the problem of mqt in magnetic nanostructures and can partially or completely suppress tunneling , restoring the initial degeneracy of the ground state @xcite .",
    "we wish to remark that understanding that motion of particles along very different classical trajectories can `` sum up '' in some sense and yield an interference picture was one of the crucial points in the development of quantum mechanics , and a considerable part of the well - known discussion between bohr and einstein was devoted to this problem .",
    "besides the importance of the tunneling phenomena in magnets from the fundamental point of view , they are potentially important for the future magnetic devices working on a nanoscale .    in the present lecture we restrict ourselves to discussing the problems of coherent mqt in various mesoscopic magnetic structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sect .  [",
    "sec : basics ] contains the elementary description of the instanton formalism , traditionally used in the theoretical treatment of mqt problems . since the instanton approach , though being the most straightforward one , is based on rather complicated mathematical formalism , we will discuss it in parallel with simple and widely known semiclassical approximation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the point is that those two approaches are equally adequate for treating the problem of mqt in small particles , and the `` standard '' semiclassical calculations , easily reproducible by anybody who learned foundations of quantum mechanics , may be helpful for understanding the structure of the results derived within the instanton technique .",
    "further , in sections [ sec : fm ] and [ sec : afm ] we discuss the problem of mqt in ferro- and antiferromagnetic small particles , with a special attention to the interference effects . for the description of afm we use simple but adequate approach based on the equations for the dynamics of the antiferromagnetism vector @xmath8 .",
    "this approach easily allows one to keep trace of the actual magnetic symmetry of the crystal ; the symmetry is lowered when external magnetic field is applied or when certain weak interactions , e.g. , the so - called dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction , are taken into account , which leads to quite nontrivial interference phenomena .",
    "section [ sec : top ] is devoted to the analysis of coherent mqt in `` topological nanostructures , '' i.e.  static inhomogeneous states of magnets with topologically nontrivial distribution of magnetization ; among the examples considered there are domain walls in one - dimensional ( 1d ) magnets @xcite , magnetic vortices @xcite and disclinations @xcite in 2d antiferromagnets , and antiferromagnetic rings with odd number of spins @xcite . for those problems , when the description of tunneling involves multidimensional ( space - time ) instantons , there is no alternative to the instanton approach and its use is decisive .",
    "finally , section [ sec : summary ] contains a brief summary and discussion of several problems which are either left out of our consideration or unsolved .",
    "for the sake of the presentation completeness , let us recall briefly the main concepts of the instanton technique , since we will extensively use them below .    in quantum field theory , the propagator , i.e. , the amplitude of probability @xmath9 of the transition from any given state with the field configuration @xmath10 at @xmath11 to another state @xmath12 at @xmath13 is determined by the path integral @xmath14/\\hbar \\big\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath15=\\int_{0}^{t_{0 } } dt\\int dx\\ , { \\cal l}[\\varphi(x , t)]\\ ] ] is the action functional . here",
    "@xmath16 is the lagrangian density , and the integration in ( [ 1to2 ] ) goes over all space - time field configurations @xmath17 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "( we leave out the problem of a consistent definition of the measure @xmath20 that arises for systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom , keeping in mind that we are going to talk about the application of field theory to the physics of spin systems on a discrete lattice , and thus all necessary regularizations are provided by the lattice in a natural way . )    instead of working with the propagator ( [ 1to2 ] ) in usual minkovsky s space - time , it is convenient to make the wick rotation @xmath21 ( essentially this procedure is an analytical continuation in @xmath22 ) , passing to the euclidean space - time",
    ". then one has the euclidean propagator @xmath23 the main contribution to the path integral comes from the global minimum of the euclidean action functional @xmath24 .",
    "this minimum corresponds to a trivial solution @xmath25 , where @xmath26 determines the minimal energy of the system .",
    "however , if several different values of @xmath26 are possible , it is often important to take into account the contribution from the _ local _ minima of the euclidean action as well .",
    "such a local minimum can correspond , e.g. , to a trajectory @xmath27 connecting two possible @xmath26 values ; it is clear that the probability @xmath28 will contain the factor @xmath29\\}/\\hbar$ ] .",
    "such a contribution can be calculated in a semiclassical approximation and describes effects which can not be accessed by means of the perturbation theory .",
    "we will illustrate the above arguments on the example of a simple quantum - mechanical problem .",
    "consider the motion of a particle of mass @xmath30 in a symmetric two - well potential @xmath5 of the type shown in fig.[fig : two - well ] , with two equivalent minima at @xmath6 .",
    "following the popular choice @xcite , we will assume this potential in the form @xmath31 where the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 determine the height and width of the barrier between two wells .",
    "this model is described by the lagrangian @xmath34 after passing to the imaginary time , the euclidean action is easily obtained in the form @xmath35 the classical ( global ) minimum of this functional is reached at @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "equations of motion for the action ( [ fi4a ] ) @xmath38 correspond to the particle moving in the potential @xmath39 , so that @xmath6 are _ maxima _ of this effective potential , and there exist classical low - energy trajectories connecting them .",
    "such trajectories represent _ local _ minima of the euclidean action functional and are called _ instantons_. they can be easily found in implicit form , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an arbitrary parameter determining the `` centre '' of instanton solution . for many potentials",
    "the integration can be performed explicitly , e.g. , in case of ( [ fi4 ] ) one obtains @xmath42\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the frequency of linear oscillations around one of classical minima .",
    "euclidean action for the instanton trajectory can be written as @xmath44 for the model ( [ fi4 ] ) one has @xmath45 .",
    "thus , instantons are very much like solitons with the difference that they are localized in time . trajectories ( [ fi4inst ] ) begin at @xmath46 in one of the minima of @xmath47 and end at @xmath48 in the other one ; the contribution of those trajectories is responsible for the tunneling splitting of the lowest energy level in the two - well potential .",
    "indeed , the tunneling level splitting is proportional to the matrix element @xmath49 of the transition from one well to the other , and the probability amplitude of such a transition is given by the path integral from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "it is thus clear that the contribution of a single instanton to the transition amplitude is proportional to @xmath50 .    the full calculation of this amplitude , however",
    ", is more complicated and should take into account not only the instanton trajectories but all trajectories close to them .",
    "further , the full variety of multiinstanton paths which bring the particle from one well to the other should be taken into account .",
    "if the problem is semiclassical , i.e.  @xmath51 is large and the probability of tunneling is small , integration over `` close '' trajectories can be described as an effect of small fluctuations above the instanton solution .",
    "even this , usually elementary , problem of integrating over small ( linear ) fluctuations is nontrivial in case of instantons , because some of those fluctuations do not change the action .",
    "particularly , from ( [ fi4inst ] ) it is easy to see that changing the position of instanton centre @xmath41 has no effect on @xmath52 .",
    "such `` zero modes '' _ always _ arise in instanton problems and their contribution requires a special analysis . detailed description of this technique would take us out of the space limits , and we refer the interested reader to textbooks and review articles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will attempt to get the correct result for the probability amplitude @xmath28 by means of the `` traditional '' quantum mechanics ( without use of path integrals and instantons ) .",
    "first , let us note that , due to the symmetry of the potential @xmath53 , two lowest levels correspond to even and odd eigenfunctions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with the energies @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . multiplying the schrdinger equation for @xmath58 by @xmath59 and vice versa , then taking the difference of those two equations and finally integrating over @xmath60 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , one obtains the relation @xmath63_{x=0}= \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\psi_{a}\\psi_{s}\\ , dx\\,,\\ ] ] which is _ exact _ and is nothing but a mere consequence of the symmetry properties .",
    "it is natural to try to use a semiclassical approximation .",
    "the semiclassical result is given , e.g. , in a popular textbook by landau and lifshitz ( @xcite , see the problem 3 after ",
    "according to that result , @xmath64 , where @xmath65^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath66 and @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] , here @xmath68 is the turnover point of the classical trajectory with energy @xmath69 ( corresponding to a non - split level ) defined by the equation @xmath70 .",
    "however , this result is not adequate for our problem , and it does not coincide with the result of instanton calculation .",
    "the point is that , surprisingly , the problem of tunneling from one classical ground state to another _ is not semiclassical : _ semiclassical approximation can not be directly applied to the ground state wavefunction inside one well .",
    "therefore we will do as follows : let us represent the wavefunctions inside the barrier region as symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the wkb exponents , @xmath71 where @xmath72}$ ] .",
    "those wavefunctions can be used inside the entire barrier region , except narrow intervals @xmath73 near the well minima , where @xmath74 is the amplitude of zero - point fluctuations .    on the other hand , if the condition @xmath75 is satisfied , then for the description of the wavefunction inside the well any reasonable potential @xmath5 can be replaced by the parabolic one , @xmath76 . then in `` non - semiclassical '' regions one may use well - known expression for the ground state wavefunction of a harmonic oscillator , @xmath77\\,.\\ ] ] thus , in the regions @xmath78 both the expressions ( [ wkb ] ) and ( [ harm ] ) are valid . then ,",
    "normalization factors @xmath79 can be determined from the condition of matching ( [ wkb ] ) and ( [ harm ] ) in the two above - mentioned regions , and after that the integration in ( [ rel1 ] ) can be performed explicitly . after some amount of algebra the tunneling level splitting can be represented in the form @xmath80 where the quantity @xmath81 coincides with the euclidean action for the instanton trajectory .",
    "one can see that the difference between the formula ( [ tunnel - qm ] ) and the usual semiclassical result consists in the pre - exponential factor containing the integral of the type @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that the main contribution into this prefactor comes from the region @xmath83 , where the integral can be approximated as @xmath84 , so that it diverges logarithmically at @xmath85 .",
    "thus for any potential @xmath5 the prefactor can be represented in the form @xmath86 or , equivalently , @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath88 is a numerical constant of the order of unity , it can be easily calculated for any given potential @xmath5 .",
    "so , finally we arrive at the following universal formula : @xmath89 for the model potentials @xmath90 and @xmath91 the value of @xmath88 is equal to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the formulas ( [ tunnel - qm],[tunnel - inst ] ) give the desired result for any two - well potential with sufficiently large barrier .",
    "the main feature of this result is the presence of an exponentially small factor .",
    "the small parameter of the mqt problem is @xmath94 , which can be represented as a ratio of the zero - point fluctuations amplitude to the distance between wells , @xmath95 .",
    "the expression @xmath96 is non - analytical in the small parameter , and thus the mqt phenomenon can not be obtained in any order of the perturbation theory .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the correct result is roughly @xmath97 times greater than that following from `` naive '' semiclassical formula .",
    "this large additional factor appears due to the contribution from the regions close to the minima of the potential , where the motion is not semiclassic .",
    "let us try to understand this in the instanton language .",
    "as we mentioned before , the small exponential factor @xmath98 arises immediately in the instanton approach ; the main problem is to compute the pre - exponential factor , which is determined by the integration over all small deviations from the instanton solution .",
    "those deviations are of two types : real fluctuations of the instanton structure , which increase the euclidean action , and `` zero modes '' which correspond to moving the instanton centre .",
    "it is rather clear that `` nonzero '' modes have a characteristic energy of the order of @xmath99 , and that the quantity @xmath100 has nothing to do with the zero mode .",
    "thus , it is obvious that the factor @xmath99 arises from the integration over all `` nonzero '' modes , and the large factor @xmath101 arises due to the zero ( in our case  translational ) mode .",
    "such a `` separation '' naturally arises in rigorous calculations @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the above result can be generalized to the case of much more complicated problems involving space - time instantons ( which , as we will see later , is important for the problem of mqt in topological nanostructures ) . for any instanton",
    "_ all _ nonzero modes yield a factor like @xmath99 , and _ each _ of the zero modes yields the factor @xmath102 @xcite , so that the final result can be reconstructed practically without calculations ( up to a numerical factor of the order of unity ) .    to illustrate one more feature typical for tunneling problems , let us consider another model @xcite : a particle of mass @xmath30 which can move along the circle of radius @xmath103 , so that its coordinate is determined by a single angular variable @xmath104 , @xmath105 , in the two - well potential @xmath106 the model",
    "is described by the following lagrangian : @xmath107 the classical lagrangian can be modified by adding the arbitrary full derivative term , e.g. , @xmath108 which of course does not change the corresponding _ classical _ equations of motion .",
    "however , adding the full derivative ( [ poctop ] ) changes the definition of the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath104 , which , as one can easily check , leads to a considerable change in the hamiltonian of the corresponding _ quantum - mechanical _ system after canonical quantization : for nonzero @xmath109 the correct hamiltonian would be @xmath110 thus , there is no one - to - one correspondence between classical and quantum - mechanical systems : several quantum systems can have the same classical system as a classical limit .    for this model problem",
    "the instanton trajectories can be written down explicitly : @xmath111\\,,\\\\ & & \\omega=(4u_{0}/mr^{2})^{1/2}\\ , .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is the arbitrary parameter determining the instanton position in the imaginary time axis and @xmath113 is the topological charge distinguishing instantons and antiinstantons ; the instanton action is finite and is given by @xmath114 .",
    "the importance of the full derivative term ( [ poctop ] ) can be most easily understood in terms of instantons .",
    "indeed , let us consider the tunneling amplitude @xmath9 from the @xmath115 well to @xmath116 one : it is clear that the contribution to this amplitude is made equally by instantons ( with @xmath104 changing from @xmath61 to @xmath117 ) and antiinstantons ( with @xmath104 changing from @xmath61 to @xmath118 ) .",
    "however , the term ( [ poctop ] ) becomes an _",
    "part of the euclidean action and leads to the additional factor @xmath119 associated with the instanton contribution and a similar factor @xmath120 for antiinstanton paths .",
    "thus , the resulting transition amplitude for nonzero @xmath109 is modified as follows : @xmath121_{\\gamma=0}\\cos(\\pi\\gamma/\\hbar)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath122_{\\gamma=0 } \\propto \\omega \\left({{\\cal a}_{0}/\\hbar}\\right)^{1/2}e^{-{{\\cal a}_{0}/\\hbar}}$ ] , according to the general result described above .",
    "one can see that for half - integer @xmath123 the interference of instanton and antiinstanton paths is _ destructive , _ so that at @xmath124 the tunneling between two wells is _ completely suppressed .",
    "_ this effect is essentially _ topological _ because the topological charge appears in the answer : the contribution of configurations with different topological charge is different . the same result can be obtained directly by solving the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ poch ] ) : for half - integer @xmath123 it can be mapped to the mathieu equation with _",
    "antiperiodic _ boundary conditions , and the corresponding energy levels",
    "are known to be doubly degenerate @xcite , which also means absence of tunneling .",
    "in this section we consider the basic technique of field - theoretical description for spin systems on the simplest example , namely a nanoparticle of a ferromagnetic material .",
    "such an object may be viewed as a zero - dimensional magnetic system , because at very low temperature all spins in the particle can be considered as pointing in the same direction .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider first the dynamics of a single spin @xmath125 . in order to obtain the effective lagrangian describing the spin dynamics , it is convenient to use a coherent state path - integral approach ( see , e.g. , the excellent textbook by fradkin @xcite ) .",
    "let us introduce a set of generalized coherent states @xcite @xmath126 parameterized by the unit vector @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 is a unit vector pointing along the @xmath129 axis , and @xmath130 denotes a spin-@xmath125 state with @xmath131 .",
    "they form a non - orthogonal ` overcomplete ' basis so that the following property , usually called a resolution of unity , holds : @xmath132 another useful property is that quantum average of @xmath133 on those coherent states is the same as of classical vector of length @xmath125 : @xmath134 in case of @xmath125=1/2 those coherent states have a very simple form and are general single - spin wavefunctions : @xmath135    we again start from the formula for propagator ( [ 1to2 ] ) which is essentially a definition of the effective lagrangian . slicing the time interval",
    "@xmath136 $ ] into infinitely small pieces @xmath137 , and successively using the identity ( [ complete ] ) , one can rewrite this propagator in @xmath138-representation as @xmath139    passing to the function @xmath140 of the continuum variable @xmath22 , one ends up with the coherent state path integral ( [ 1to2 ] ) where the action @xmath141 is determined by the effective lagrangian @xmath142    it can be shown that the dynamical part of this lagrangian has the form @xmath143 for arbitrary @xmath125 this calculation requires some algebra , but for the simplest case @xmath144 it is straightforward . the expression ( [ berry ] ) is nothing but the berry phase @xcite for adiabatic motion of a single spin .",
    "it should be remarked that the presence of the full derivative term @xmath145 is rather nontrivial and allows one to capture subtle differences between integer and half - integer spins , as we will see below .",
    "for example , consider a single spin @xmath125 in some crystal - field potential , with the effective hamiltonian @xmath146 where @xmath147 and the easy - plane anisotropy @xmath148 is much stronger than the in - plane anisotropy @xmath149 .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath150 there are two equivalent classical minima of the potential at @xmath151 , @xmath115 and @xmath151 , @xmath116 .",
    "paths with @xmath152 make the main contribution into the tunneling amplitude , so that we can approximately set @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and expand in @xmath155 up to quadratic terms in the lagrangian ; in the term proportional to @xmath156 the @xmath149 contribution may be neglected as small comparing to the contribution of @xmath148 .",
    "after that , the `` slave '' variable @xmath155 can be excluded from the lagrangian ( `` integrated out '' of the path integral ) because the corresponding equation of motion @xmath157 allows to express @xmath155 through @xmath104 explicitly : @xmath158 substituting this solution into the original lagrangian ( [ singspinl ] ) , one obtains the effective lagrangian depending on @xmath104 only : @xmath159 we see that we end up with the lagrangian of a particle on a circle from the previous section , with the topological term @xmath160 . for each path where @xmath104 changes from @xmath61 to @xmath117",
    "there is a corresponding antiinstanton path with @xmath104 changing from @xmath61 to @xmath118 , and those paths contribute to the tunneling amplitude with phase factors @xmath161 and @xmath162 . for half - integer @xmath125",
    "those contributions precisely cancel each other , making the tunneling impossible .",
    "this is exactly in line with the well - known kramers theorem , which states that in absence of external magnetic field all energy levels of a system with half - integer total spin should be twofold degenerate .",
    "one can also straightforwardly check that for a single spin in magnetic field , i.e. , for @xmath163 , the correct energy levels can be obtained only with the full derivative term taken into account .",
    "now we are prepared enough , finally , to consider the problem of tunneling in a small ferromagnetic particle consisting of @xmath164 spin-@xmath125 spins .",
    "if we assume that ferromagnetic exchange interaction is so strong that we may consider all spins as having the same direction , then we come to the `` giant spin '' model where the entire particle is described as a quantum - mechanical ( `` zero - dimensional '' ) system with only two degrees of freedom @xmath165 and @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , we should postulate that in our path integral , when integrating over the coherent state configurations latexmath:[$\\prod_{i=1}^{n } \\otimes    with all @xmath164 vectors @xmath167 replaced by the same vector @xmath127 , and we take into account only configurations from this subspace . assuming that the crystal - field anisotropy has the form ( [ singspinh ] ) , we come to essentially the same effective lagrangian ( [ singspinleff ] ) , and the only difference is that eq.([singspinleff ] ) should now be multiplied by the total number of spins @xmath164 .",
    "the tunnel splitting of the ground state level , according to eq.([ampltop ] ) , is given by @xmath168 where @xmath88 is a numerical constant of the order of @xmath169 .",
    "a remarkable property of the result ( [ splitfm ] ) is that presence of a large number @xmath164 in the exponent can be to some extent compensated by smallness of the ratio @xmath170 .",
    "however , when the in - plane anisotropy @xmath171 , the splitting vanishes ( this reflects the fact that in uniaxial case tunneling is impossible because of the conservation of the corresponding projection of the total spin ; the same is true for @xmath172 ) .",
    "another remarkable feature is that for half - integer @xmath125 the finite splitting can be observed only in particles with even number of spins @xmath164 ; since in any statistical ensemble @xmath164 fluctuates a bit , this roughly means that only one half of all particles gives nonzero contribution .",
    "statistical fluctuations of @xmath164 have another , more painful consequence : since @xmath164 stays in the exponent , even small fluctuations of the total number of spins in the particle lead to large fluctuations of the splitting . moreover , since @xmath164 scales as the third power of the linear size @xmath173 , small fluctuations of @xmath173 will be considerably enhanced in @xmath164 .",
    "this may be crucial if one tries to detect the splitting by means of some resonance technique : the initially weak signal would be even more weakened by the strong broadening of the resonance peak .",
    "actually , many factors can prevent one from observing the tunneling resonance , e.g. , relaxation , temperature effects , etc .",
    "here we will not at all touch the problem of relaxation because of its complexity ; instead of that we refer the interested reader to the review @xcite .",
    "taking into account the finite temperature effects is also nontrivial , particularly because it requires changing the procedure of taking averages in the path integral : statistical averages should be taken simultaneously with quantum - mechanical ones .",
    "roughly ( and without taking into account the temperature dependence of relaxation mechanisms ) the effects of finite temperature can be estimated with the help of the concept of a characteristic temperature @xmath174 below which the effects of quantum tunneling prevail over thermal transitions .",
    "rough estimate for @xmath174 is obtained from the comparison of the relative strength of two exponential factors : thermal exponent @xmath175 and tunneling exponent @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the height of barrier separating two equivalent states and @xmath52 is the corresponding instanton action , then @xmath178 . it is easy to see that for the ferromagnetic particle problem considered above @xmath179 i.e. the temperature of crossover from classical to quantum transitions is in this case rather small since it is determined by weak ( relativistic ) anisotropy interaction constants ; for typical anisotropy values @xmath180 is about @xmath181  k.",
    "the problem of continuum field description of antiferromagnet ( afm ) is more complicated but also much more interesting than a similar problem for ferromagnet .",

    "in fact , the only justification of this approximation is energetical : if the particle size is much smaller than the characteristic domain wall thickness , any inhomogeneous perturbation costs much energy . on the other hand , for the hamiltonian ( [ singspinh ] ) neither @xmath415 nor @xmath416 are good quantum numbers , which means presence of magnons ( deviations from collinear order ) in the ground state .",
    "our lecture was devoted first of all to the fundamental aspects of mqt considered as a beautiful physical phenomenon which is rather difficult to observe .",
    "but technological development can lead to the situation when this phenomenon will become practically important .",
    "the present tendency of increasing the density of recording in the development of information storage devices means decrease of the elementary magnetic scale corresponding to one bit of information , and one may expect that quantum effects will determine the `` natural limit '' of miniaturization in future .",
    "sections [ sec : dm ] and [ sec : rings ] were written together with v.  kireev whom the authors wish to thank for cooperation .",
    "this work was partially supported by the grant 2.4/27 `` tunnel '' from the ukrainian ministry of science .",
