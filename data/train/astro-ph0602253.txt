    "accretion disks are tremendous energy sources in the active universe ( see kato et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) .",
    "in particular , when the mass - accretion rate highly exceeds the critical rate , the disk local luminosity exceeds the eddington one , and mass loss from the disk surface driven by radiation pressure takes place .",
    "such a radiatively driven outflow from a luminous disk has been extensively studied in the context of models for astrophysical jets by many researchers ( bisnovatyi - kogan , blinnikov 1977 ; katz 1980 ; icke 1980 ; melia , knigl 1989 ; misra , melia 1993 ; tajima , fukue 1996 , 1998 ; watarai , fukue 1999 ; hirai , fukue 2001 ; fukue et al .",

    "; renaud , henri 1998 ; luo , protheroe 1999 ; fukue 2005a ) , as outflows confined by a gaseous torus ( lynden - bell 1978 ; davidson , mccray 1980 ; sikora , wilson 1981 ; fukue 1982 ) , or as jets confined by the outer flow or corona ( sol et al . 1989 ; marcowith et al . 1995 ; fukue 1999 ) , and as numerical simulations ( eggum et al . 1985 , 1988 ) . in almost all of these studies , however , the disk radiation fields were treated as external fields , and the radiation transfer was not solved .",
    "the radiation transfer in the disk , on the other hand , was investigated in relation to the structure of a static disk atmosphere and the spectral energy distribution from the disk surface ( e.g. , meyer , meyer - hofmeister 1982 ; cannizzo , wheeler 1984 ; shaviv , wehrse 1986 ; adam et al .",

    "2005 ) . in these studies ,",
    "however , the vertical movement and mass loss were not considered . moreover ,",
    "their treatments were restricted in the non - relativistic regime , and the relativistic effects were not considered .    in order to break such a situation , where radiation transfer has not been considered in the radiatively driven wind from the disk , we recently examined the radiatively driven vertical outflow  _ moving photosphere _  in a luminous flat disk ( fukue 2005b , c ) .",
    "in these papers , the radiative transfer flow was analytically or numerically solved , but the obtained flow speed was limited in the subrelativistic regime , since the problem was treated up to the order of @xmath3 . in some astrophysical jet sources , however , the jet speed is mildly or highly relativistic . in gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "the flow speed is supposed to be extremely relativistic .",
    "hence , in the next step , we should consider the transfer flow up to the full order of @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "fukue 1999 ; hirai , fukue 2001 ; fukue et al . 2001 ; orihara , fukue 2003 ; fukue 2005a without transfer ) .",
    "moreover , although it was incorporated in the previous paper ( fukue 2005b ) , which were up to the first order of the flow velocity , the effect of radiation drag must become much more important ( phinney 1987 ; icke 1989 ) .",
    "other relativistic effects would further appear in the fully relativistic regime .    in this paper , we thus examine the radiatively driven transfer outflow in a luminous flat disk within the fully relativistic regime of @xmath4 . at the preliminary stage , we ignore the gravity of the central object , the gas pressure , and the viscous heating , and we treat the wind as a vertical one - dimensional flow without rotational motion .    in the next section",
    "we describe basic equations in the vertical direction . in section 3",
    "we examine the boundary condition at the flow top , and show the magic speed above the moving source . in section 4",
    "we then solve and examine a radiative flow under the appropriate boundary conditions at the flow base and top .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose a luminous flat disk , deep inside which gravitational or nuclear energy is released via viscous heating or other processes .",
    "the radiation energy is transported in the vertical direction , and the disk gas , itself , also _",
    "moves _ in the vertical direction due to the action of radiation pressure ( i.e. , plane - parallel approximation ) . for the sake of simplicity , in the present paper , the radiation field",
    "is considered to be sufficiently intense that both the gravitational field of , e.g. , the central object and the gas pressure can be ignored : tenuous cold normal plasmas in the super - eddington disk , cold pair plasmas in the sub - eddington disk , or dusty plasmas in the sub - eddington disk .",
    "internal heating is also ignored : the flow in or near to the surface envelope of the disk . as for the order of the flow velocity @xmath1",
    ", we consider the fully special relativistic regime , where the terms are retained up to the second order of @xmath5 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the radiation hydrodynamic equations for steady vertical ( @xmath6 ) flows are described as follows ( kato et al .",

    "the first term in the brackets on the right - hand side of equation ( [ u1 ] ) means the radiatively driven force , which is modified to the order of @xmath21 , whereas the second term is the radiation drag force , which is also modified , but roughly proportional to the velocity .    in the no - gas pressure approximation and without heating ,",
    "the energy equation is reduced to a radiative equilibrium relation , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the emissivity defined in the comoving frame . in this equation ( [ j1 ] ) , the third and fourth terms on the right - hand side appear in the relativistic regime .    for radiation fields , the zeroth - moment equation becomes @xmath24 .",

    "are usually adopted as boundary conditions ( e.g. , artemova et al .",
    "1996 ) . as will be shown below , however , the radiation fields above the luminous disk are changed when the disk gas itself does move upward ( `` moving photosphere '' ) .",
    "even in such a case , however , if the flow speed is small compared with the speed of light , the conditions for a static photosphere would be approximately adopted , and we can use these conditions in a previous paper ( fukue 2005b ) , where the flow speed is limited in the subrelativistic regime .",
    "when the flow speed is of the order of the speed of light , on the other hand , we should carefully treat the boundary condition for the moving photosphere .",
    "thus , in the present paper , where the flow is treated in a fully relativistic manner , we must derive the exact boundary conditions above the moving photosphere .",
    "in addition , for the radiatively driven flow in the relativistic regime , it becomes important the effect of radiation drag , which suppresses the jet speed ( phinney 1987 ; icke 1989 ) .",

    "applying these boundary conditions to equations ( [ k ] ) and ( [ l ] ) , we have two relations on the boundary values and mass - loss rate : @xmath73    physically speaking , in the radiative flow starting from the flow base with an arbitrary optical depth @xmath66 , for initial values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 at the flow base , the final values of the radiation fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the flow velocity @xmath71 at the flow top can be obtained by solving basic equations .",
    "furthermore , the mass - loss rate @xmath10 is determined as an eigenvalue so as to satisfy the bondary condition at the flow top ( cf .",
    "fukue 2005b in the subrelativistic regime ) .    in the present full relativistic case ,",
    "however , the final values of the radiation fields at the flow top depend on the flow velocity there , and the final values at the flow top can not be analytically expressed by the initial values at the flow base .",
    "hence , in this paper we determine the mass - loss rate as follows .    in radiative flow with optical depth @xmath66 ,",
    "we first give the final flow velocity @xmath71 ( and @xmath46 ) , instead of the initial value of @xmath68 .",

    "this singularity originates from the closure relation ( [ e ] ) , and coincides with the _ sound speed _ of the relativistic ( photon ) gas . in other words ,",
    "equation ( [ u ] ) has a form of the transonic wind equation for the relativistic ( photon ) gas with sound speed @xmath78 . in usual wind equations from a gravitating source",

    "in addition , from the linear analysis around a critical point , the velocity gradient near to the singularity is found to be @xmath82 .",
    "we show an example of `` critical solutions '' in figure 3 , where the parameters are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "as can be seen in figure 3 , one of the critical solutions ( a solid curve ) has a positive velocity , and is an outward breeze solution , which decelerates toward low optical depth .",
    "another ( a dashed curve ) has a negative velocity , and is an inward settling solution , which decelerates toward a high optical depth .",
    "both solutions decelerate in the direction of the flow due to the radiation drag force .",
    "however , neither satisfies the present boundary conditions at the flow base and the flow top . indeed , in order for flow to be accelerated , the velocity gradient @xmath86 should always be negative , but it is positive around a critical point for an outward solution .",
    "hence , the flow in the present framework can not pass through the critical point .",
    "thus , for the present purpose , such `` critical solutions '' are inadequate , and the flow is always subsonic or supersonic in the sense that the flow speed is always less than or greater than @xmath78 . and since we assume that the flow starts with @xmath87 at @xmath74 , we suppose a _ subsonic _ flow in the present paper : @xmath88 .",

    "another relativistic manifestation is the existence of the singular point in the equation , which is related to the sound speed of the relativistic ( photon ) gas .",
    "since the `` critical solutions '' for the present problem do not satisfy the present boundary conditions , we obtained _ subsonic _ solutions , which is always less than the relativistic sound speed of @xmath78 .",
    "nevertheless , we can find the relativistic solution , whose final speed is greater than the magic speed above a static source .",
    "the appearance of this singularity may come from the closure relation for the quantities of radiation fields , which assumes the usual eddington approximation in the comoving frame ( kato et al .",
    "1998 ) . that is , in the comoving frame",
    "we assume @xmath102 where subscript 0 denotes the quantities in the comoving frame .",
    "the appearance of the singularity suggests that the eddington approximation would be violated in the relativistic flow , whose velocity is greater than @xmath78 .",
    "this may be because the diffusion speed in the comoving frame can not exceed @xmath78 , and/or the diffusion would not be isotropic in the comoving frame . indeed , if we assume that the diffusion in the comoving frame is no longer isotropic , but the factor @xmath103 in equation ( [ p0e0 ] ) is variable , similar to the usual variable eddington factor , we can formally extinguish the singularity .",
    "the plane - parallel assumption may also play a role in the existence of the singularity , as well as the existence of the radiation drag force , which is related to the closure approximation transformed to the inertial frame .",
    "the nature of critical points should be examined more carefully . in any case",
    ", the existence of the singularity does not mean that the flow velocity can not exceed @xmath78 , but merely suggests a possible failure of the formalism adopted in the present analysis .",
    "the relativistic radiative flow investigated in the present paper must be quite _ fundamental _ to accretion disk physics , astrophysical jet formation , gamma - ray bursts , etc . ,",
    "although the present paper is only the first step and there are many simplifications at the present stage .    at first ,",
    "in a rigorous sense , the present situations , such as a plane - parallel assumption , are valid only in very specific circumstances . indeed ,",
    "when the accretion rate exceeds the critical one , the disk would puff up to be geometrically thick , and the plane - parallel approximation would be violated . in a rough sense , however , the present situations could be approximately valid in such a thick disk , as long as the gas motion and the radiative flux are almost vertical .",
    "if the gas motion is not vertical , but expands like a spherical flow , the present treatment must be reexamined .",
    "in contrast to the plane - parallel case considered in the present paper , the spherically expanding case is also of great interest to us , and should be examined in the future .    in the present paper",
    ", we have assumed that the opacity is frequency - independent ( gray ) , and therefore the radiation pressure force is independent of the velocity . in a cold gas",
    ", however , atomic absorption opacities become important .",
    "such opacities are frequency - dependent , and therefore the radiation pressure force would be a function of the doppler shift between the main absorption troughs and the peak of the black body spectrum from the disk . hence , the radiation energy flux @xmath104 would generally be a function of the velocity @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , in such a case of atomic opacities , the super - eddington radiation - pressure force on the flow may arise from a larger absorption opacity .",
    "since the acceleration nature would be drastically changed , such a _ line - driven radiative flow _ must be carefully examined .",
    "furthermore , we ignored the gravitational field produced by the central object .",
    "this means that the flow considered in the present paper would correspond to normal plasmas in the super - eddington disk , pair plasmas in the sub - eddington disk , or dusty plasmas in the luminous disk .",
    "in other cases , or even for normal plasmas in the super - eddington disk , the gravitational field would affect the flow properties ( cf .",
    "fukue 2005c for a subrelativistic case ) .",
    "in particular , since the gravitational field in the vertical direction is somewhat complicated ( e.g. , fukue 2002 , 2004 ) , the influence of the gravitational field is important",
    ".    we also ignored the gas pressure .",
    "this means that the radiation field is sufficiently intense . in general cases , where the gas pressure is considered ,",
    "there usually appear sonic points ( e.g. , fukue 2002 , 2004 ) , and the flow is accelerated from subsonic to supersonic .    in the high - energy regime , including relativistic flow and hot gas , the compton heating and cooling would be important , although we have dropped such an effect .",
    "if the compton heating of the gas by intense radiation fields works , the gas might be radiatively heated to very high temperatures , and the atomic absorption opacity could be significantly reduced .",
    "such a radiative effect in the energy equation should also be examined in future work .",
    "the authors would like to thank professors s. kato and s. inagaki for their useful comments and discussions .",

    "<S> radiatively driven transfer flow perpendicular to a luminous disk was examined under a fully special relativistic treatment , taking into account radiation transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the flow was assumed to be vertical , and the gravity , the gas pressure , and the viscous heating were ignored . in order to construct the boundary condition at the flow top , the magic speed above the flat source was re - examined , and it was found that the magic speed above a moving source can exceed that above a static source ( @xmath0 ) . then , the radiatively driven flow in a luminous disk was numerically solved , from the flow base ( disk `` inside '' ) , where the flow speed is zero , to the flow top ( disk `` surface '' ) , where the optical depth is zero . for a given optical depth and appropriate initial conditions at the flow base , where the flow starts , a loaded mass in the flow was obtained as an eigenvalue of the boundary condition at the flow top . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a loaded mass and the flow final speed at the flow top were obtained as a function of the radiation pressure at the flow base ; the flow final speed increases as the loaded mass decreases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the flow velocity and radiation fields along the flow were obtained as a function of the optical depth . within the present treatment , the flow three velocity @xmath1 </S>",
