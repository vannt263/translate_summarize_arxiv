    "a quantized vortex is a topological excitation of superfluidity and superconductivity as the hallmark of a single wave function for the macroscopic quantum state .",
    "revealed first by abrikosov based on the celebrated ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory , a vortex in superconductor carries a normal core with size of the order of superconducting coherence length @xmath1 , and a quantized magnetic flux distributed over the london penetration depth @xmath2 ; in superconductors categorized as type ii with @xmath3 , as opposed to type i with @xmath4 , vortices repel each other because of the circular supercurrents and thus form a triangular vortex lattice . in type",
    "i superconductors , vortices would attract each other in order to gain the superconducting condensation energy , and thus collapse into a continuum of normal region at equilibrium .",
    "the recently discovered multi - band superconductors , such as @xmath0 @xcite and iron pnictide superconductors@xcite , can exhibit novel phenomena@xcite ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) , without counterpart in single - band superconductors .",
    "it was first proposed theoretically by babaev and speight@xcite that , when the london penetration depth falls in between the two coherence lengths , vortices may attract at large separation and repel at short distance because of the competition of different length scales in different condensates .",
    "it was then discussed by moshchalkov _",
    "_ that this situation was realized in their sample of @xmath0 , as manifested by the unconventional stripe and gossamer - like vortex patterns@xcite .",
    "they coined the term of type 1.5 superconductor for the class of multi - band superconductors .    while this scenario is intriguing and",
    "has attracted considerable interests @xcite , there are several points waiting for further investigation . in the theoretical side ,",
    "one notices that the original proposal was based on weak inter - component coupling limit , and the discussions were implicitly extended to low - temperature regime .",
    "in doing so , one should always keep in mind that gl theory works only close to the critical point of the composite system , at least in principle .",
    "any result appearing only away from the critical point needs a careful and independent check . in the experimental side ,",
    "the observed inter - vortex separation @xmath5 m is much larger than the distance associated with the possible energy minimum estimated by the theory @xcite , lacking a consistent understanding .",
    "the random vortex configurations reported in refs .",
    "@xcite seem incompatible with common experiences in material science : particles governed by the lennard - jones interactions form solids with regular orders , and thus those random patterns are hard to be considered as a property of equilibrium at usual conditions in absence of random pins .    in the present work ,",
    "we reveal first a case that the bare mean - field critical points of the two components coincide with each other , and furthermore the inter - band coupling disappears at the same temperature .",
    "we introduce two vortices into a square superconductor by setting appropriate boundary condition , and find with the approach of time - dependent gl ( tdgl ) that , for appropriate parameters in the gl free energy functional , the two vortices are separated by a distance associated with an energy minimum , which does not change with the system size for simulations .",
    "this verifies the attraction between vortices at large distance and repulsion at short distance .",
    "the vortices are found stable against thermal fluctuations .",
    "we evaluate the full dependence of interaction potential on vortex separation by the variational method .",
    "distribution of vortices are then simulated based on the langevin dynamics . instead of uniform vortex lattice in type ii superconductors as well as the lamella structure in type i superconductors ,",
    "we observe phase separations among clusters of triangularly ordered vortices and meissner regions , which indicates a first - order phase transition associated with penetration of vortices into the system upon increase of external magnetic field .",
    "based on these observations we construct the phase diagram for superconductors with the novel vortex interaction .",
    "we also investigate the vortex interaction when two components have different bare critical points and a finite inter - band coupling .",
    "close to the critical point of the composite system , the superconductivity in different components is strongly correlated and only one divergent length associated with the variation of order parameters at the vortex core exists . thus vortices are purely repulsive or attractive close to the critical point .",
    "it is noticed that novel vortex attractions were discussed 40 years ago in single - band superconductors , which caused phase separation between meissner phase and vortex lattice , and discontinuous jumps in magnetization , especially at low temperature ( see ref.@xcite for review ) .",
    "these superconductors are characterized by small gl numbers , and the attractive vortex interactions were attributed to correction to the gl approach from the bcs theory@xcite , which is different from the system discussed by @xcite and addressed in the present work .    the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "since it was discussed that vortex attraction originates from the overlapping of normal vortex cores,@xcite let us check the temperature dependence of the structure of a single vortex ranging from 0 to @xmath12 . for simplicity , we take @xmath239 and assume @xmath240 and @xmath7 are @xmath173-independent .",

    "this result is understandable since the inter - band coupling is dominant at @xmath242 , and thus the superconductivity in the two bands is strongly correlated and described by a unique coherence length . nevertheless ,",
    "if the inter - band coupling @xmath243 and @xmath228 all vanish at a single temperature @xmath12 as discussed in the previous sections , there will be two divergent lengths and thus different core sizes for the two components .",

    "we have investigated the interaction between vortices in two - band superconductors . when the size of the magnetic flux of a vortex lies between the sizes of the two normal cores associated with the two condensates ,",
    "the interaction between vortices is attractive at large separation and repulsive at small separation .",
    "this was demonstrated clearly by the time - dependent ginzburg - landau calculations on two vortices in a superconducting disk .",
    "the equilibrium distance between two vortices is independent of the size of the disk for simulations , which clearly shows the existence of energy minimum in the interaction potential .",
    "the full dependence of interaction energy on the vortex separation is obtained by the variational calculations .",
    "the two methods give the same estimate on the vortex separation with minimal free energy .",
    "we have studied stable vortex configurations for a large number of vortices by langevin dynamics adopting the novel distance dependence of vortex interaction .",
    "circular vortex clusters coexisting with meissner phase are observed for small and intermediate vortex densities . the transition from meissner state into vortex states is therefore of first order associated with a sharp increase of magnetization .",
    "the superconductivity associated with the triangular vortex lattice is suppressed by a strong magnetic field in the same way of a type ii superconductor .",
    "therefore , the magnetic behavior of these superconductors as summarized in the mean - field phase diagrams interpolates those of the type i and type ii superconductors .",
    "in most temperature regions except very close to the critical point , thermal fluctuations are weak for small ginzburg number , the same as single - band superconductors .",
    "the above interesting phenomena take place provided , first , the bare mean - field critical points of the two bands coincide with each other and the inter - band coupling vanishes at the same temperature , which permit two divergent core sizes associated with the two condensates even close to the critical point ; second , the parameters in the ginzburg - landau free energy are appropriate to achieve the relations among the two coherence lengths and the penetration depth .    when two condensates have different bare transition temperatures and the inter - band coupling is finite , the superconductivity is induced by the inter - band scattering when temperature is sufficiently close to the critical point of the composite system . in this case , superconductivity in the two bands couples strongly , and only one divergent coherence length exists , and thus the superconductors are either type i or type ii .",
