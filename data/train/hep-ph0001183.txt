    "low energy hadron dynamics is determined by the structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "once we thought this ground state was empty , but now we know it is a seething cauldron of quarks , antiquarks and gluons . indeed , so strong are their interactions that they form all measure of condensates : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc .",
    "it is the nature of this vacuum and the scale of these condensates that determine low energy hadron physics .",
    "it is this that we can learn about at da@xmath3ne .",
    "most importantly , the vacuum determines the spectrum of hadrons and its scale .",
    "thus the nucleon has a mass of 1 gev , while conventional @xmath4 mesons , like the @xmath5 , are two - thirds of this mass , but pions merely 140 mev .",
    "indeed , it is these masses squared that determines dynamics and having @xmath6 gev@xmath7 makes pions by far the lightest of all hadrons .",
    "this is a question for which we have had a good idea of the answer for many decades , but in fact its only now that we are on the threshold of definitively testing .",
    "we begin with qcd with two flavours of quark , for simplicity .",
    "then we have kinetic energy and interaction terms in the lagrangian for both the up quark and the down .",
    "since the proton and neutron masses are almost equal , we can imagine that @xmath8 .",
    "then qcd has an exact @xmath9 symmetry , which is reflected at the hadron level by the proton and neutron having the same strong interactions .",
    "now , the scale of qcd is fixed on renormalization by the momentum scale at which the strong interaction is strong .",
    "this @xmath10 mev .",
    "the current masses of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks are very small . at a few mev , they are much smaller than @xmath13 and so almost massless .",
    "if we separate the quark wavefunction into left - handed and right - handed components , it is only the mass term in the lagrangian that couples left and right .",
    "so , if @xmath14 , there is no such coupling and we can make @xmath9 transformations in the right - handed space , quite independently of those on the left . while this is a symmetry at the quark level , it is not there at the hadron level .",
    "scalar and pseudoscalars , vectors and axial vectors are not degenerate in mass .",
    "thus this symmetry must be broken at the hadron level .       a way to picture this",
    "was introduced by nambu  @xcite nearly forty years ago , long before the advent of qcd . consider a hadron world with just scalar , @xmath15 , and pion fields @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "then we can imagine that the form of the potential generated by their interactions , though symmetric in @xmath15 and @xmath17 , may not be simply parabolic with a minimum when these fields are zero , but could be mexican hat shaped , fig .",
    "the ground state chosen by nature is where the @xmath15 field has a non - zero vacuum expectation value , fig .  1 .",
    "the particles we observe correspond to quantum fluctuations about this ground state .",
    "the scalar field is massive as the fluctuations go up and down the sides of the _ hat _ , while the goldstone fluctuations are massless corresponding to motion round the _",
    "hat_. this is an illustration of goldstone s theorem with nambu s ferromagnetic analogy .",
    "it is natural to identify these goldstone modes with the pions , or in a world with 3 massless quark flavours with the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is only a model of the hadron world  @xcite .",
    "what does qcd tell us is happening at the quark - gluon level ?",
    "we can calculate the fully dressed quark propagator by summing all possible gluonic emissions and absorptions .",
    "if the current mass of the quarks is zero , then it is well known that the fermion mass function remains zero at all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "thus any breaking of chiral symmetry must be non - perturbative .",
    "this we might calculate on the lattice , but zero mass particles do nt fit on a finite sized lattice .",
    "consequently , we most naturally calculate the quark propagator in the continuum using the schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "these provide a genuinely non - perturbative set of integral equations in which the behaviour of the quark propagator is determined in terms of the dressed gluon ( and ghost ) propagators , and quark - gluon interactions  @xcite .",
    "such calculations have reached a stage of maturity that we can be certain that provided the effective quark - gluon coupling is large at infrared momenta less than @xmath13 , then a non - zero mass function is generated even though the current mass is zero .",
    "this mass function , fig .",
    "2  @xcite , produced by gluonic clouds and the @xmath0 sea is 350400 mev at low euclidean momenta .",
    "thus a quark s constituent mass is dynamically generated .",
    "importantly , this is merely an _ effective _ low energy mass : quarks being confined have no poles in their propagators and are never on - shell . from the large momentum behaviour of this mass function",
    "we learn this corresponds to the formation of @xmath0 condensates of size @xmath21 a value totally consistent with qcd sum - rule phenomenology .",
    "with the light quark propagator determined , one can consider the @xmath0 bound states with pseudoscalar and scalar quantum numbers , fig .",
    "the pseudoscalar bound state is massless , as one would expect for an explicit realisation of goldstone s theorem .",
    "in contrast , the scalar is massive , with a mass of roughly twice that of the dressed ( or constituent ) quark .",
    "these scalars are the higgs bosons of the strong interaction , responsible for the masses of all light hadrons  @xcite .",
    "though these qcd calculation and nambu s modelling are quite consistent in their phenomenology , there has been the proposal of jan stern and collaborators  @xcite that chiral symmetry breaking need not be the result of such a large @xmath0 condensate .",
    "instead this condensate could be small , perhaps @xmath22 , as in an antiferromagnetic analogy , and other condensates could be important in breaking chiral symmetry . since physics is an experimental subject , we must test this hypothesis .",
    "the study of low energy @xmath23 scattering provides just such an opportunity .",
    "consider the amplitude @xmath24 for the process @xmath25 in the @xmath26channel",
    "if one of the pions is massless , chiral symmetry requires that in the limit when the 4momentum of this massless pion goes to zero , the amplitude vanishes .",
    "thus we have at the symmetry point of the mandelstam triangle @xmath27  this is known as the adler condition .",
    "this means that , though @xmath23 scattering is by definition a strong interaction process , it is actually weak at low energies .",
    "it is then natural that we can make a taylor series expansion of the low energy amplitude about the adler point in powers of momenta and the mass of the off - shell pion .",
    "the scale for this expansion is supplied by @xmath28 in hadron dynamics , or more naturally by @xmath29 in chiral dynamics terms .",
    "then at the symmetry point of the mandelstam triangle with all the pions having their physical mass , we have the prediction @xmath30 where the parameter @xmath31 depends of the size of @xmath32 .",
    "in fact , @xmath33 for standard chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath34 )  @xcite with a large condensate and @xmath35 with a small condensate  @xcite , as is possible in generalised @xmath36 . thus , @xmath37",
    "though the size of the @xmath38condensate can engender a factor of 4 variation in the amplitude at the centre of the mandelstam triangle , both versions of the chiral expansion agree in the physical regions , where for instance at the @xmath5 their parameters are fixed by experimental data , fig .",
    "thus only very close to threshold is there any testable difference between the large and small condensate predictions .",
    "the closest to the symmetry point that one can get experimentally is by considering the lifetime of pionic atoms .",
    "this provides a direct measurement of the amplitude @xmath24 at @xmath39 , fig .",
    "the decay rate , which is the inverse of the lifetime , is proportional to the modulus squared of this amplitude , with proportionality constants that have recently been corrected by higher orders in the electromagnetic coupling , fig .  5 , and for higher orders in the chiral expansion , among other considerations  @xcite .",
    "there is now a consensus on the relationship  @xcite .",
    "ps212 at cern , the dirac experiment  @xcite , is designed to measure the lifetime of such pionic atoms .",
    "dirac has had a successful run this year and the expectation is that with further running scheduled for 2000 , they will be able to determine the scattering length for @xmath25 to an accuracy of 10% , with the ultimate hope of @xmath40 in later years .",
    "another experiment that we will hear about at this meeting involves @xmath41 decays , both in e865 at brookhaven  @xcite and here with the kloe detector  @xcite . with a branching ratio of @xmath42 , kaons decay into a dilepton pair , mainly @xmath43 , and a charged dipion pair . measuring the dependence of the decay distribution on its five kinematic variables , one can in principle determine the relative phase of the @xmath23 system in an @xmath44 and @xmath45wave . by the famous theorem of final state interactions of watson ,",
    "this phase difference is exactly the same phase difference as in @xmath23 scattering .",
    "the pions scatter universally , independently of the way they are produced .",
    "the results for this phase difference from previous experiments by the university of pennsylvania  @xcite with 7000 decays and by the geneva - saclay group  @xcite with 30000 are shown in fig .",
    "6 , together with the predictions of s@xmath46pt and for g@xmath46pt with @xmath47 and 3 .",
    "one sees that the error bars from the current experiments have to be substantially smaller than those in fig .  6 if we are going to be able to discriminate between values of @xmath31 and hence the size of the @xmath48condensate . however , the correlation with energy is just as important as individual data - points for this determination .",
    "this we will hear about too at this meeting  @xcite .",
    "another topic that addresses the nature of the qcd vacuum is the study of @xmath49 mixing .",
    "we are all familiar with the mixing among the vector and tensor mesons , where the octet and singlet components mix ideally to give physical states of definite quark flavour .",
    "we know the @xmath50 and @xmath51 are within @xmath52 of this ideal situation .",
    "the same pattern emerges whether one considers the meson masses , their hadronic decays , their production in @xmath53 , etc .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that @xmath49 mixing depends critically on the quantity considered  @xcite .",
    "as recognised by leutwyler  @xcite , two mixing angles are in fact required : one for the octet sector and the other for the singlet .",
    "these differ because the singlet couples to the vacuum .",
    "first we specify decay constants @xmath54 for the nine pseudoscalars @xmath55 ( with momentum @xmath56 ) by analogy with that of the pion from @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "we can then define two mixing angles @xmath59 and @xmath60 by  @xcite @xmath61 these angles are defined so that in the limit in which they vanish the @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the limit of exact @xmath64 flavour , @xmath65 .",
    "now , leutwyler  @xcite has shown how one can expand the difference in these angles as @xmath66 as the physical kaon decay constant @xmath67 , this implies that @xmath68 .",
    "we are thus far from the @xmath69 symmetry in this sector  the singlet couples to the vacuum . in a recent comprehensive survey of @xmath49 mixing ,",
    "feldmann  @xcite has shown how the mixing in different situations for different quantities can all be reconciled by introducing these two mixing angles , which differ by @xmath70 .",
    "the reason for the interest in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 is because of the way these states are intimately tied to the structure of the qcd vacuum . clearly , the @xmath71 is only a little heavier than the kaons , but the @xmath72 at 958 mev is much heavier , particularly as it is the mass squareds that are relevant . in the @xmath64 chiral",
    "limit , when the masses of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath73 quarks all go to zero , the 8 flavour components of the octet axial vector current of eq .",
    "( 3 ) are all conserved and the @xmath20 is massless .",
    "however , the divergence of the singlet current is given by the topological charge density and according to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly is non - zero .",
    "in contrast , in the limit of large @xmath74 , all nine components of the divergence of the axial vector current vanish and the @xmath75 becomes a ninth goldstone boson . thus the mixing in this sector teaches us how close nature is to the chiral or to the large @xmath74 limits of qcd .       from the quark line diagrams shown in fig .",
    "7 , it was recognised long ago by deshpande and eilam  @xcite , and then by rosner  @xcite , that @xmath51 radiatively decaying to the @xmath71 and @xmath72 can test their strange quark content , the @xmath51 acting as an @xmath76 source . at that time",
    "the mixing was assumed to be simply governed by one mixing angle .",
    "now we know better .",
    "nevertheless , these decays provide a key test of the mixing , fixing parameters such as @xmath77 , the coupling to the wess - zumino term  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath78 is reasonably well determined to be @xmath79%  @xcite . from this , one predicts that the corresponding ratio for @xmath80 is between 4 and 8 times @xmath81 depending on the value of @xmath82 . the 1997 experimental value from cmd2  @xcite gave a far bigger range from the branching ratio of @xmath83 .",
    "however , the more recent results from vepp-2 m  @xcite show that with much improved statistics , da@xmath3ne should be able not only to test our current understanding of @xmath49 mixing , but to fix the parameters in such a scheme .",
    "the nature of the lightest scalar mesons has long been an enigma  @xcite .",
    "there are far more than can fit into one quark model multiplet , table  1 .",
    "some have claimed that there is a @xmath84 at 900 mev  @xcite , as well as at 1430 mev , and so perhaps there are two nonets .",
    "the lass data rules this out  @xcite , just as a re - analysis of the cern - munich polarised target data  @xcite rules out the oft - claimed _ narrow _ @xmath85 , see for example  @xcite .",
    "even so , there are too many isoscalar states , table  1 .",
    "one may be a glueball , or several may be mixed with glue  @xcite .    0.1 in    . _",
    "the light scalar mesons .",
    "_ [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     in reality , the choices are not likely to be so stark . in the calculation of tornqvist",
    "( and boglione and myself )  @xcite the physical @xmath86 is only 20% @xmath0 and 70% @xmath87 .",
    "an outstanding calculation is to deduce what this inevitable mixture means for the predictions for their two photon decays and for their appearance in @xmath88radiative decays .",
    "that is a challenge for theorists .",
    "the challenge for da@xmath3ne is to produce high statistics results on @xmath89 , and on all of @xmath78 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "then we have the hope of understanding the nature of the qcd vacuum a little more clearly : a vacuum that shapes the world of hadrons , of hadronisation and all other aspects of confinement  an exciting prospect .",
