    "we report here on the results of a search for the lepton flavour violating decay @xmath0 , based on data collected during the first three months period of the meg experiment .",
    "this operates at the 590@xmath4mev proton ring cyclotron facility of the paul scherrer institut ( psi ) , in switzerland .",
    "lepton flavour conservation in the standard model @xmath4(sm ) is associated with neutrinos being massless .",
    "recent observations of neutrino oscillations  @xcite imply a non - zero mass and hence the mixing of lepton flavours .",
    "however , in minimal extensions to the sm , with finite but tiny masses , charged lepton flavour violating processes are strongly suppressed and beyond experimental reach .",
    "additional sources of lepton flavour violation ( lfv )  @xcite appear in theories of supersymmetry , grand unification or in extra dimensions , giving predictions that have now become accessible experimentally .",
    "hence , the present lack of observation of a signature of charged lfv may change with improved searches and reveal new physics beyond the sm or significantly constrain the parameter space of such extensions .",
    "the strongest bounds on charged lfv come from the muon system , with the current limit for the branching ratio br@xmath5 ( 90@xmath6  c.l . ) , set by the mega experiment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 process is characterized by a simple two - body final state , with the positron and photon being coincident in time and emitted back - to - back in the rest frame of the muon , each with an energy equal to half that of the muon mass .",
    "there are two major sources of background , one from radiative muon decay ( rmd ) @xmath8 and the other from accidental coincidences between a high energy positron from the normal muon decay @xmath9 ( michel decay ) and a high energy photon from sources such as rmd , positron annihilation - in - flight or bremsstrahlung",
    ". both types of background can mimic a @xmath10 event by having an almost back - to - back photon and positron .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite , taking into account the muon rate as well as the acceptances and resolutions , that the accidental case dominates .",
    "hence the key to suppressing such backgrounds lies in having a continuous muon beam , a good quality beam transport system and precision detectors with excellent spatial , temporal and energy resolutions .",
    "this is the basis for the novel design of meg .",
    "a schematic of the experiment is shown in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "surface muons of 28@xmath4mev / c from one of the world s most intense sources , the @xmath11e5 channel at psi , are stopped in a thin , partially depolarizing polyethylene target , placed at the centre of the positron spectrometer . to facilitate a stopping rate of @xmath12 in the 18@xmath4mg/@xmath13 thick target , with minimum beam - related background , a wien filter and a superconducting transport solenoid ( bts ) with a central degrader system",
    "are employed .",
    "the meg beam transport system so , cleanly separates ( 7.5@xmath14 ) the eight times higher positron contamination to provide a pure muon beam .",
    "the use of a helium environment in the spectrometer , together with a slanted target , ensures minimal multiple scattering for both the muons and the out - going positrons .",
    "this is essential also for limiting background production , such as annihilation - in - flight and bremsstrahlung , in the acceptance region , centred around 90@xmath15 to the incoming beam .",
    "positrons originating from muon decay are analyzed in the cobra ( constant - bending - radius ) spectrometer consisting of a thin - walled superconducting magnet with a gradient magnetic field , a tracking system of low - mass drift chambers and two fast scintillator timing - counter arrays .",
    "the gradient magnetic field in the spectrometer , ranging from 1.27 tesla at the centre to 0.49 tesla at either end , is designed such that positrons emitted from the target with the same momentum follow trajectories with an almost constant projected bending radius , independent of their emission angle .",
    "this allows a preferential acceptance of higher momentum particles in the drift chambers as well as sweeping away particles more efficiently , compared to a uniform field .",
    "the drift chamber system ( dch ) consists of 16 radially aligned modules , spaced at @xmath16 intervals , forming a half - circle around the target .",
    "each drift chamber module contains two staggered layers of anode wire planes each of nine drift cells .",
    "the two layers are separated and also enclosed by 12.5@xmath17 m thick cathode foils with a vernier pattern structure .",
    "the chambers are operated with a helium : ethane ( 50:50 ) gas mixture , allowing this low - mass construction to total @xmath18@xmath19 along the positron trajectory .",
    "positron timing information originates from fast , scintillator timing - counter arrays ( tc ) , placed at each end of the spectrometer .",
    "each array consists of 15 bc404 plastic scintillator bars , with 128 orthogonally placed bcf-20 scintillating fibres .",
    "each bar is read - out at either end by a fine - mesh photomultiplier tube , while the fibres are viewed by avalanche photo - diodes . the precise timing and",
    "charge signals provide both the impact point on the tcs and give directional information on the positron .",
    "the photon detector is a 900  litre homogeneous volume of liquid xenon ( lxe ) that subtends a solid - angle acceptance of @xmath20 .",
    "it uses scintillation light to measure the total energy released by the @xmath21-ray as well as the position and time of its first interaction . in total , 846 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , internally mounted on all surfaces and submerged in the xenon , are used .",
    "the advantage of using liquid xenon is its fast response , large light yield and short radiation length .",
    "stringent control of contaminants is necessary since the vacuum ultra - violet ( vuv ) scintillation light is easily absorbed by water and oxygen even at sub - ppm levels .",
    "the xenon is therefore circulated in liquid phase through a series of purification cartridges , and in gas phase through a heated getter .",
    "both the optical properties of xenon as well as the pmt gains and quantum efficiencies are constantly monitored by means of leds and pointlike @xmath22am @xmath23-sources deposited on thin wires stretched inside the active volume . the detector is maintained at 165  k by means of a pulse - tube refrigerator with a cooling power of 200  w.    to select matched photon and positron candidates in a high rate , continuous beam environment and store sufficient information for offline analysis requires a well matched system of front - end electronics , trigger processors and data acquisition ( daq ) software .",
    "the front - end electronics signals ( 2748 ) are actively split and go to both the trigger and the in - house designed waveform digitizer boards . the latter are based on the multi - ghz domino ring sampler chip ( drs ) , which can sample ten analogue input channels into 1024 sampling cells each at speeds of up to 4.5@xmath4ghz .",
    "the sampling speed for the drift chamber anode and cathode signals is 500@xmath4mhz , while that of the pmt signals from the photon detector and timing counters is 1.6@xmath4ghz .",
    "this strategy gives maximum flexibility , allowing various read - out schemes , such as zero suppression , on an event - by - event basis for various trigger types .",
    "the system achieves an excellent pile - up recognition , together with superior timing and amplitude resolutions , compared to conventional schemes .",
    "the trigger is based on fast information from the two detectors using pmts : the liquid xenon photon detector and the positron timing counters .",
    "it makes use of a subset of the kinematic observables from @xmath17-decay at rest , requiring an energy deposit in the photon detector in an interval around @xmath24mev , a time coincident positron hit on the timing counters and a rough collinearity of the two particles , based on their hit topology .",
    "the decay kinematics is reconstructed by electronics boards arranged in a triple layer tree - structure .",
    "the signal digitization is executed by means of a @xmath25  mhz ,",
    "@xmath26-bit flash analogue - to - digital converter .",
    "a pre - scaled , multi - trigger event scheme is used for data - taking allowing calibration , background and signal events to be read - out together . the typical signal event rate was @xmath27  hz , and the total daq rate was @xmath28  hz , with an average livetime of @xmath29 .    in total ,",
    "nine front - end computers are used for the daq , each sending an event fragment to a central event building computer over a gigabit ethernet link .",
    "an integrated slow - control system enables both equipment control and monitoring .",
    "a detailed geant 3.21 based monte carlo simulation of the full apparatus ( transport system and detector ) was developed and used throughout the experiment , from the design and optimization of all sub - systems to the calculation of acceptances and efficiencies .",
    "the long term stability of the meg experiment is an essential ingredient in obtaining high quality data over extended measurement periods .",
    "continuous monitoring and frequent calibrations are a prerequisite .",
    "apart from such items as the liquid xenon temperature and pressure , the drift chambers gas composition and pressure and the electronics temperature , a number of additional measurements must be performed to keep the subdetectors calibrated and synchronized .",
    "the three most important are nuclear reactions from a cockcroft - walton ( cw ) accelerator , radiative muon decay ( rmd ) runs and pion charge - exchange ( cex ) reaction runs .",
    "three times a week during normal data - taking , @xmath21-rays of moderate energy coming from nuclear reactions of protons on a li@xmath30b@xmath31o@xmath32 target are used .",
    "protons of variable energy ( @xmath33  kev ) are produced by a dedicated cw - accelerator placed downstream of the experiment .",
    "the muon stopping target is automatically replaced by a remotely extendable beam pipe which places the nuclear target at the centre of the detector .",
    "photons of @xmath34  mev from @xmath35li(@xmath36)@xmath37be allow the monitoring of the lxe detector energy scale , while coincident @xmath21 s from @xmath38b(@xmath36)@xmath39c ( @xmath40  mev ) detected simultaneously by the timing counter and the xenon detector allow the determination of time offsets of tc bars .",
    "once a week an entire day of rmd data - taking at reduced beam intensity was performed , with the trigger requirements relaxed to include non back - to - back positron - photon events in a wider energy range .",
    "two cex runs ( @xmath41 ) were also conducted , one at the beginning and one at the end of the data - taking period .",
    "pion capture at rest in a liquid hydrogen target produces photons with energy @xmath42  mev . by detecting one of these photons with the lxe detector and the other at 180@xmath15 by means of a set of nai crystals , preceded by a lead / scintillator sandwich ,",
    "two mono - energetic calibration lines at the extremes of the energy spectrum are obtained . these enable measurement of the energy scale and uniformity .",
    "dalitz decays ( @xmath43 ) were also collected by using a photon - positron coincidence trigger , and used to study the detector time synchronization and resolution .",
    "the combined use of all these methods enables the investigation of possible systematic variations of the apparatus .",
    "the data sample analyzed here was collected between september and december 2008 and corresponds to @xmath44 muons stopping in the target . at the first stage of the data processing ,",
    "a data reduction is performed by selecting events with conservative criteria that require the time of the photon detector signal to be close to that of a timing counter hit , and at least one track to be detected by the drift chamber system .",
    "this reduces the data size to 16% of the recorded events .",
    "the pre - selected data are again processed and those events falling into a pre - defined window ( blinding - box ) , containing the signal region on the @xmath21-ray energy and the time difference between the @xmath21-ray and the positron , are `` hidden '' , _",
    "i.e. _ written to a separate data - stream , in order to prevent any bias in the analysis procedure . only the events outside the blinding - box are used for optimizing the analysis parameters and for studying the background .    during the course of the data - taking period the light yield",
    "of the photon detector was continuously increasing due to the purification of the liquid xenon , which was performed in parallel .",
    "furthermore , an increasing number of drift chambers suffered from frequent high - voltage trips resulting in a reduction of the positron detection efficiency by a factor of three over the period .",
    "the increase of the xenon light yield was carefully monitored with the various calibration tools and it is taken into account in the determination of the energy scale .",
    "the trigger thresholds were also accordingly adjusted to guarantee a uniform efficiency . for the drift chamber system we adopted a normalization scheme which depends only on the ratio of the signal positron reconstruction efficiency relative to that of the michel positron , in order to be insensitive to absolute efficiencies .",
    "a candidate @xmath0 event is characterized by the measurement of five kinematic parameters : positron energy ( @xmath45 ) , photon energy ( @xmath46 ) , relative time between the positron and photon ( @xmath47 ) and opening angles between the two particles ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "the positron track is reconstructed with the kalman filter technique @xcite , in order to take into account the effect of the multiple scattering and energy loss in the detector materials in the variable magnetic field .",
    "the positron energy scale and resolution are evaluated by fitting the kinematic edge of the measured michel positron energy spectrum at 52.8mev as shown in figure  [ fig : michel spectrum ] .",
    "the fit function is formed by folding the theoretical michel spectrum form with the energy - dependent detector efficiency , and the response function for mono - energetic positrons .",
    "the latter is extracted from the monte carlo simulation of @xmath51 decays , and is well described by a triple gaussian function ( a sum of a core and two tail components ) .",
    "the resolutions extracted from the data are @xmath52  kev , @xmath53  mev and @xmath54  mev in sigma for the core component and the two tails , with corresponding fractions of @xmath55% , @xmath56% and @xmath57% , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty on these numbers is dominated by systematic effects and was determined by varying both the event selection and fitting criteria .",

    "a small correction is made to take into account the different background present in the lxe volume during the operation with the pion beam .",
    "the line shape is asymmetric with a low energy tail due to @xmath21-rays converting in front of the lxe sensitive volume .",
    "a 3d mapping of the parameters is also made , since they depend to some extent on the position of the @xmath21-ray conversion , mainly on the conversion depth inside the detector ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "as an example , the average resolution for deep events ( @xmath60  cm ) is measured to be @xmath61  fwhm with a right tail of @xmath62 , where the error quoted includes the variation over the acceptance .",
    "the energy scale is constantly monitored by looking at the reconstructed @xmath63  mev energy peak from cw protons on li and confirmed by a fit of the photon energy spectrum to the expected spectra from the @xmath64 decay , positron annihilation - in - flight and @xmath65ray pile - up , folded with the line - shape determined during the @xmath66-experiment .",

    "the trigger efficiency ratio is different from one due to the imposition of stringent angle matching criteria at the trigger level .",
