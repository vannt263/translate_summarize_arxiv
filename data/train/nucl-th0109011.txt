    "the @xmath0 optical potential in nuclear matter is computed using a @xmath1 effective interaction , g - matrix , derived microscopically from a meson - exchange potential @xcite .",
    "the g - matrix is given by the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation    @xmath8    which takes into account the different channels ( @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , which are coupled by the strong interaction .",
    "at lowest order in the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory , the single - particle potential for antikaons @xmath11 at @xmath2 is given by    @xmath12    in which @xmath13 is self - consistently determined .    in order to introduce in - medium effects on the intermediate states of the g - matrix ,",
    "we have employed mean field single - particle propagators for the baryons .",
    "the single - particle potential for nucleons has been derived from a @xmath14 model , while for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we have followed the parameterization of ref .",
    "finally , the pion is dressed with the momentum and energy dependent self - energy of ref .",
    "@xcite , that incorporates the coupling to particle - hole , @xmath17-hole and two particle - two hole excitations .",
    "fig.1 shows the real and imaginary part of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath18 at @xmath2 for @xmath19 including or not the dressing of pions .",
    "the long - dashed line has been calculated determining the complex @xmath0 single particle energy self - consistently .",
    "however , the pion self - energy in the intermediate states is not included .",
    "this procedure is similar to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite with the inclusion here of a @xmath14 model for the nucleon dressing .",
    "the presence of the @xmath20 resonance , dynamically generated in our model , introduces a strong energy dependence on the @xmath1 amplitude which governs , in turn , the behaviour of @xmath11 .",
    "the pauli blocking on the intermediate nucleons has a repulsive effect on the resonance , produced by having moved the threshold of intermediate states to higher energies .",
    "the self - consistent incorporation of the @xmath0 properties on the @xmath1 g - matrix moves the resonance back in energy , but it dilutes as the density increases . if we now include the dressing of pions ( solid line ) , we obtain a less attractive real part , going from @xmath21 mev to @xmath22 mev at @xmath23 mev , and a smoother behaviour for the imaginary part .",
    "this can be understood by looking again to the @xmath1 amplitude , specially for @xmath24 . due to the additional dressing of the pions",
    ", the resonance dissolves even faster loosing structure , although it shows a tendency to move to higher energies .",
    "the introduction of temperature in the calculation affects the pauli blocking of the intermediate nucleon states in the g - matrix .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 optical potential is calculated according to    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the nucleon momentum distribution at finite temperature . by looking at fig.2",
    ", one observes that , as the temperature increases , @xmath27 is less attractive and shows a smoother behaviour in momentum . at finite @xmath6 , the sum over momenta in eq.([uk ] )",
    "is extended over the corresponding fermi distribution , and higher nucleon momentum translates into a weaker interaction .",
    "moreover , the effective interaction has also changed .",
    "however , this last effect is less important . at @xmath28 mev ,",
    "the momentum dependence is very smooth , reducing in a factor of three the difference between low and high momentum .",
    "however , @xmath27 is still attractive .",
    "this fact can be used to understand the enhancement of the observed ratio @xmath29 in heavy - ion collisions at gsi energies .",
    "_ heavy - ion collisions _ provide a unique possibility to create a dense and hot nuclear system to study the in - medium properties of hadrons , like in - medium effects on the @xmath0",
    ". the measured ratio of particles @xmath29 gives us information about the necessity of an in - medium attractive potential for the @xmath5 , already corroborated in the analysis of kaonic atoms .    in direct nucleon - nucleon collisions",
    ", the production of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is governed by quite distinct thresholds ( for @xmath30 , the threshold is at 1.58 gev and for @xmath31 is 2.5 gev ) , and the @xmath4 multiplicity exceeds the @xmath5 one by 1 - 2 orders at a given energy above thresholds .",
    "however , this large difference disappears for nucleus - nucleus collisions ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xcite ) , where the data nearly fall on the same curve .",
    "furthermore , we observe that this ratio is approximately constant for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite , although absorption of @xmath5 via @xmath35 is supposed to be higher for heavier nuclei @xcite .",
    "it turns out that both effects can be interpreted by assuming an in - medium attractive @xmath11 @xcite    analysis of @xmath36 in @xmath33 at gsi energies @xcite gives a ratio around @xmath37 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that this ratio can be explained in terms of a _ thermal model _ , i.e.",
    ", the final state can be described as a _ hadronic gas _ in chemical equilibrium at a given temperature . imposing exact strangeness conservation , one obtains ,",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 are the spin - isospin degeneracies and @xmath40 is the interaction volume .",
    "the above expression shows that the presence of @xmath4 must be compensated by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath5 to conserve strangeness equal to zero , while @xmath5 can only be compensated by @xmath4 .",
    "it is found that the data @xcite can be explained using a @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev .",
    "g.brown @xcite introduced the notion of `` broad - band equilibration '' in heavy - ion processes at gsi energies . in this interpretation , due to the compensation between the increase in @xmath43 as the density increases and the density dependence of @xmath11 ,",
    "the ratio is constant over a large range of densities , not only for @xmath44 , but also up to @xmath45 .    in fig.3",
    ", we show the importance of dressing @xmath5 . plotting the ratio @xmath36 as function of density",
    ", it can be seen that the effect of including @xmath11 reduces the ratio that , otherwise , would increase steadily ( short - dashed line ) .",
    "it is also seen that dressing the pions induces appreciable differences in the calculations ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "once the full dressing is included , fig.4 shows the sensitivity of the ratio to the chemical potential , and hence to density , as well as the importance of introducing the @xmath16 in the balance equation .",
    "the `` broad - band equilibration '' is hardly reproduced when the @xmath16 is taken into account , and one obtains large differences depending on the character ( attractive or repulsive ) of the @xmath16 optical potential .",
    "performing a microscopic calculation of the brueckner - hartree - fock type , we conclude that dressing pions in the calculation of @xmath11 introduces significant differences , around 13@xmath46 at zero momentum .",
    "moreover , the introduction of temperature gives rise to a smoother behaviour in momentum , being attractive even at momentum as large as 500 mev , relevant in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "heavy - ion collisions are the perfect scenario to test in - medium @xmath0 properties , specially in understanding the ratio @xmath29 .",
    "the attempts to reproduce this ratio require an attractive @xmath11 .",
    "the ratio shows a measurable density dependence .",
    "the `` broad - band equilibration '' is far from being reproduced if hyperons like @xmath16 are taken into account , showing large differences with regard to only including @xmath15 hyperons .",
    "we are very grateful to dr .",
