    "<S> some work has been devoted to observer design for systems possessing symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite consider a finite - dimensional group of symmetries acting on the state space , and @xcite a left - invariant dynamics on a lie group . </S>",
    "<S> symmetries generally correspond to invariance to some changes of units and frame . </S>",
    "<S> invariance to any change of coordinates was raised by @xcite who designed an intrinsic observer for a class of non - linear systems : lagrangian systems with position ( configuration ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to estimate the velocity , independently from any nontrivial choice of coordinates , and of course never differentiate the ( noisy ) output . </S>",
    "<S> the observer was adapted to the specific case of a left - invariant system on a lie group by  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> observer @xcite is based on the riemannian structure of the configuration manifold endowed with the kinetic energy metric . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry had already been used in control theory of mechanical systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the observer is local .    according to the maupertuis principle , the motion of a conservative lagrangian system is a geodesic flow ( motion along a geodesic with constant speed ) for the jacobi metric , </S>",
    "<S> intrinsically defined using the kinetic and potential energies , up to a time reparametrization . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the general problem of building a reduced order velocity observer for geodesic flow on a riemannian manifold with position measurements . a reduced observer is meant to estimate only the unmeasured part of the system s state ( here the velocity ) . under some basic assumptions relative to the injectivity radius ( also formulated in @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> we have the following results ( theorem 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if there is an upper bound @xmath0 on the sectional curvature in all planes , choosing @xmath1 , the reduced velocity observer always converges exponentially to the true velocity , as long as the gain is larger than a linear function of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the higher the gain is the most sensitive to noise the observer is . </S>",
    "<S> an even better situation occurs when the sectional curvature is non - positive in all planes : the reduced observer is globally exponentially convergent for all positive gain . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the more negative the curvature is the faster the observer converges . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is surprising enough as negative curvature implies exponential divergence between two nearby geodesics , and thus  amplifies \" initial errors . </S>",
    "<S> this is a major difference with @xcite who used additional terms precisely to cancel the effects of ( negative ) curvature .    for mechanical lagrangian systems </S>",
    "<S> the observer of aghannan and rouchon is only locally convergent . in the absence of external forces </S>",
    "<S> the reduced observer provides an alternative observer which allows to always estimate the true velocity . when there are external forces , the reduced - observer can be used as a complement to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gain must be chosen large enough , so that the reduced observer converges before the energy varies significantly . </S>",
    "<S> if so , it provides an estimated velocity close to the true one , with which the observer @xcite can be initialized .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduced observer is also applied , formally , to a basic velocimetry problem : compute the velocity of a perfect incompressible fluid observing the fluid particles . </S>",
    "<S> the principle of least action implies that the motion of an incompressible fluid can be viewed as a geometric flow . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case of a two - dimensional fluid . as the convergence properties of the observer </S>",
    "<S> depend on the sign of the curvature , we will use results and heuristics of arnold @xcite . following them , </S>",
    "<S> we show that global convergence could be expected for a large class of trajectories , since the curvature is positive only in a few sections . </S>",
    "<S> this latter fact also implies instability of the flow , and arnold interpretes the difficulty of weather s prediction as a consequence of this result . </S>",
    "<S> note that the problem tackled is nontrivial , as the system is nonlinear , infinite dimensional , and possibly sensitive to initial conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> in section i we give the general motivations introducing lagrangian systems on manifolds and maupertuis principle . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii we introduce the observer . in section iii </S>",
    "<S> we consider applications to some mechanical and hydrodynamical systems . in section iv the convergence in the case of positive constant curvature is illustrated by simulations on the sphere . </S>"
