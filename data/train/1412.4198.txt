    "one of the earliest solution concepts considered in game theory are _ saddle points _ ,",
    "combinations of actions such that no player can gain by deviating  ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in two - player zero - sum games",
    ", every saddle point happens to coincide with the optimal outcome both players can guarantee in the worst case and thus enjoys a very strong normative foundation .",
    "unfortunately , however , saddle points are not guaranteed to exist .",
    "this situation can be rectified by the introduction of _",
    "mixed_randomized  strategies , as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "proved that every zero - sum game contains a mixed saddle point , or equilibrium .",
    "while equilibria need not be unique , they maintain two appealing properties of saddle points : _ interchangeability _ ( any combination of equilibrium strategies for either player forms an equilibrium ) and _ equivalence _ ( all equilibria yield the same expected payoff ) .",
    "mixed equilibria have been criticized for resting on demanding epistemic assumptions such as the expected utility axioms by @xcite .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite . as @xcite puts it : `` when randomized strategies are used in a strategic game , payoff must be replaced by expected payoff . since the game is played only once , the law of large numbers does not apply , so it is not clear why a player would be interested specifically in the mathematical expectation of his payoff ''  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the existence of saddle points can also be guaranteed by moving to _ minimal sets _ of actions rather than randomizations over them .",
    "@xcite defines a _ generalized saddle point ( gsp ) _ to be a tuple of subsets of actions for each player that satisfies a simple external stability condition : every action not contained in a player s subset is dominated by some action in the set , given that the other player chooses actions from his set .",
    "a gsp is minimal if it does not contain another gsp .",
    "minimal gsps , which shapley calls _ saddles _ , also satisfy internal stability in the sense that no two actions within a set dominate each other , given that the other player chooses actions from his set . while shapley was the first to conceive gsps , he was not the only one .",
    "apparently unaware of shapley s work , @xcite uses the very related concept of a _",
    "consistent pair _ to point out epistemic inconsistencies in the concept of iterated weak dominance . also , _",
    "weakly admissible sets _ as defined by @xcite in the context of spatial voting games and the _ minimal covering set _ as defined by @xcite in the context of majority tournaments are gsps @xcite .    in this paper , we consider gsps with respect to weak dominance .",
    "an action weakly dominates another action if it always yields at least as much utility .",
    "@xcite notes that no general uniqueness result is available for this type of saddle .",
    "later , uniqueness has been shown for restricted classes of zero - sum games , namely tournament games @xcite and confrontation games @xcite .",
    "we show that all weak saddles of a given zero - sum game are interchangeable and equivalent .",
    "this implies the above - mentioned uniqueness results and shows that every zero - sum game possesses a unique set - based value .",
    "our result can be interpreted as an ordinal variant of the minimax theorem .",
    "a finite two - player zero - sum game is given by a matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the finite set @xmath1 of rows represents the row player s actions , and the finite set @xmath2 of columns represents the column player s actions .",
    "if the row player chooses action @xmath3 , and the column player chooses action @xmath4 , then the _ payoff _ ( or _ utility _ ) of the row player is given by the entry @xmath5 of the matrix , while the payoff of the column player is given by @xmath6 .",
    "for nonempty subsets @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 denotes the _ subgame _ in which the row player has action set @xmath10 and the column player has action set @xmath11 .",
    "an action @xmath12 _ weakly dominates _ another action @xmath13 with respect to a set @xmath8 of columns , denoted @xmath14 , if @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "] similarly , an action @xmath17 _ weakly dominates _ another action @xmath18 with respect to a set @xmath19 of rows , denoted @xmath20 , if @xmath21 ( and thus @xmath22 ) for all @xmath23 .",
    "_ strict dominance _ is defined analogously , with the weak inequalities replaced by strict inequalities .",
    "dominance relations can be extended to sets of actions as follows .",
    "a set @xmath24 of rows _ weakly _ ( resp . _ strictly _ ) _ dominates _ a set @xmath25 of rows with respect to @xmath26 if for every row @xmath27 , there exists a row @xmath28 such that @xmath29 weakly ( resp .",
    "strictly ) dominates @xmath30 with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "we denote this by @xmath31 ( resp .",
    "@xmath32 ) .",
    "dominance between sets of columns is defined analogously , and denoted @xmath33 ( for weak dominance ) and @xmath34 ( for strict dominance ) .",
    "we are now prepared to define _ saddles _ , which are based on the notion of a _",
    "generalized saddle point ( gsp ) _",
    "given a subset @xmath19 of rows and a subset @xmath8 of columns , the product @xmath35 is a _ weak gsp _ if @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the product @xmath38 is a _ weak saddle _ if it is a weak gsp and no proper subset of it is a weak gsp .. in some papers @xcite , the dominance used for weak saddles requires at least one strict inequality . in the context of confrontation games ( see ) , where weak saddles have usually been considered , both notions of weak saddles coincide .",
    "@xcite defines weak saddles as we do here .",
    "it is easily seen that our theorem does not hold for weak saddles that require at least one strict inequality ( see , for example , the restriction to the first two rows and columns of game @xmath39 in ) . ]",
    "strict gsps and strict saddles are defined analogously .",
    "@xmath40    in contrast to strict saddles , weak saddles are extensions of saddle points in the sense that every saddle point constitutes a weak saddle .",
    "since the product @xmath41 containing all actions is a trivial weak and strict gsp of any game , weak and strict saddles are guaranteed to exist . while strict saddles have been shown to be unique in zero - sum games ( see ) ,",
    "this is not the case for weak saddles .",
    "it is noteworthy that saddles generally _ can not _ be found by the iterated elimination of ( weakly or strictly ) dominated actions .",
    "see for examples .",
    "in this section , we prove that weak saddles in zero - sum games are interchangeable and equivalent . we begin with a lemma .",
