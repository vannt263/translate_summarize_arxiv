    "recent investigations have fostered new interest in globular cluster ( gc ) stellar populations .",
    "the traditional vision of gcs hosting simple , single age , single metallicity stars has been shattered by the discovery of multiple sequences in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) and of large dispersions in light or heavy element abundances , often showing well defined patterns , which are the result of nuclear processes in a previous generation of stars . + ngc 1851 is one of the gcs where multiple stellar populations have been clearly identified . indeed , in recent years",
    ", this gc has been the subject of a wide photometric and spectroscopic observational campaign .",
    "first of all , @xcite have identified a double subgiant branch ( sgb ) in the cluster cmd , clearly suggesting the presence of at least two stellar generations .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , if the sgb split would be due to a different age between the two populations with similar metal content , the second generation of stars should have formed @xmath1 1 gyr after the first one .",
    "however other factors could be at work . as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the sgb splitting",
    "could also be explained by a difference in the total c+n+o content , with an abundance for the fainter sgb 2 - 3 times larger than that of the brighter one . in this case",
    ", the age spread would be smaller , of the order of a few hundred myrs .",
    "unfortunately , we have scarce information on detailed abundances of ngc 1851 stars .",
    "@xcite collected low resolution spectra for 18 stars .",
    "they found a constant iron content , but 3 out of 8 of their bright rgb stars show anomalously strong cn bands .",
    "more recently , @xcite analyzed uves spectra of eight giants .",
    "with all the limitations coming from the small number statistics , @xcite results seem to indicate the presence of a na - o anticorrelation , and the presence of a large star to star abundance scatter of s - process elements zr and la , with some hints of a bimodal distribution .",
    "they also find a large star to star variation in the strength of the ba lines .",
    "they also show that the split of the rgb found by @xcite in a strmgren photometry cmd is related to the double sgb .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of la / zr - strong stars ( 40% ) is tantalizing similar to the fraction of sgb - faint stars ( 45% ) , and to the fraction of the cn - strong , ba - strong , and sr - strong rgb stars ( 40% ) of @xcite .",
    "but the sample statistics for stars with abundance estimates is very poor .",
    "+ recently , @xcite suggested the presence of a large c+n+o spread ( @xmath10.6 dex ) among ngc 1851 giant stars .",
    "their work is based on high resolution spectra of four stars .",
    "this spread could imply that one population has 4 times larger c+n+o content with respect to the other , supporting the scenario proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , also in this case , the statistics is very poor .        in order to account for such observational results",
    ", it has been proposed that a second generation of stars may have formed from a residual reservoir of gas polluted by intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star ejecta @xcite , or from the ejecta of massive fast rotating stars @xcite . +",
    "a very recent work by @xcite proposes another possibility . using strmgren photometry and the ca narrow - band filter centered on the h - k ca lines at @xmath13950  , @xcite",
    "find a significant color split in the rgb of many clusters , including ngc  1851 . because of the observed split , @xcite propose that the two rgbs have a different ca content , of the order of @xmath2 dex . in this case , the second generation of stars could originate from gas polluted by sneii explosions , the only mechanism able to produce a ca enhancement . however , this scenario is quite controversial , because multiple cmd sequences have been found in other clusters , where abundances based on high resolution spectra give a negligible or very low ca spread .",
    "for example , there is the case of m4 , where @xcite and @xcite found no ca spread at all , while @xcite presented a cmd with a double rgb . in m4 ,",
    "a clear rgb spread is visible in ultraviolet broad - band photometry ( see fig .",
    "11 of @xcite ) , but , as discussed in @xcite , the photometric spread can be better explaind by a spread in c , n , o .",
    "+ the only way to solve the enigma is to measure c ,",
    "n , o , @xmath0 , iron - peak , and s - process element abundances for a statistically significant sample of rgb stars . for this purpose",
    "we observed a sample of 15 rgb stars distributed among the two rgbs of the strmgren ( v , v - y ) cmd with high and medium resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the observations , data reduction , chemical abundance analysis , and results will be presented in the following sections .    in this letter",
    "we discuss only the results on fe , ca , s - process , and c+n+o content , i.e. the most relevant elements in the context of the present debate on multiple stellar populations in gcs .",

    "our dataset consists of high and medium resolution spectra collected in november - december 2008 .",
    "the spectra come from single @xmath11500 and @xmath1500 s exposures , obtained with the mike and mage slit spectrographs respectively , mounted at the magellan / clay telescope .",
    "weather conditions were excellent with a typical seeing of 0.5 arcsec .",
    "we selected 15 isolated stars from 0.5 magnitudes above the rgb - bump to the tip of the rgb , in the magnitude range 15.5@xmath313.5 .",

    "the mage spectra have a spectral coverage from 3700 to 9500   with a resolution of @xmath1 5000 and s / n@xmath450 at 4300  .",
    "data were reduced using iraf including bias subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration , scattered - light and sky subtraction , and spectral rectification . + in the case of mike observations , spectra were corrected for fringing using the spectrum of a hot fast rotating star , which gave the best result compared with other methods . however",
    ", fringing did not affect the spectral region we were interested in ( below 8100  ) .",
    "targets were carefully selected in order to have stars in each of the two distinct rgbs clearly separated in the high quality v vs. v - y strmgren photometry cmd ( see fig .",

    "all stars were observed with both spectrographs .",
    "radial velocities were measured by the _ fxcor _",
    "package in iraf , using a synthetic spectrum as a template .",
    "the mean heliocentric value for our targets is 320.3@xmath51.1 km / s , while the dispersion is 4.4@xmath50.8 km / s .",
    "@xcite gives 320.5@xmath50.6 km / s as heliocentric radial velocity for ngc1851 , and the typical dispersion for a cluster of its mass is @xmath14 - 5 km / s @xcite .",
    "all our targets have a radial velocity within @xmath515 km / s of the cluster radial velocity . on the basis of this result",
    ", we conclude that all our targets are cluster members .",
    "the chemical abundances for na , si , ca , ti , fe , and ni were obtained from the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the spectral lines .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed explanation of the method we used to measure the ews and for the adopted solar abundances . for the other elements ( c , n , o , y , zr , ba ) , whose",

    "na presents few features in the spectrum , so in this case abundances derived from the ews were cross - checked with the spectral synthesis method in order to obtain more accurate measurements .",

    "first of all t@xmath6 was derived from the v - i color using the relation by @xcite and the reddening from @xcite .",
    "surface gravities ( @xmath7 ) were obtained from the canonical equation :    @xmath8    where the mass @xmath9 was derived from isochrone fitting using the padova database @xcite , and the luminosity @xmath10 was obtained from the absolute magnitude @xmath11 assuming an apparent distance modulus of @xmath12=15.47 @xcite . the bolometric correction ( bc )",
    "was derived by adopting the relation bc - t@xmath6 from @xcite .",
    "finally , microturbulence velocity ( @xmath13 ) was obtained from the relation of @xcite . + these atmospheric parameters were considered as initial estimates and were refined during the abundance analysis . as a first step atmospheric models were calculated using atlas9 @xcite and assuming the initial estimate of t@xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath13 , and the [ fe / h ] value from @xcite .",
    "+ then t@xmath6 , @xmath13 , and @xmath7 were adjusted and new atmospheric models calculated in an interactive way in order to remove trends in excitation potential ( e.p . ) and equivalent widths vs. abundance for @xmath14 and @xmath13 respectively , and to satisfy the ionization equilibrium for @xmath7 .",
    "fei and feii were used for this purpose .",
    "the [ fe / h ] value of the model was changed at each iteration according to the output of the abundance analysis .",
    "+ the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) program moog @xcite was used for the abundance analysis .",
    "we checked the reliability of our atmospheric parameters in the following way .",
    "intrinsic v - i colours of our stars were obtained from our t@xmath6 by inverting the @xcite equation . comparing intrinsic and measured colours we got a reddening of e(b - v)=0.01@xmath50.01 ( assuming e(v - i)=1.24@xmath15e(b - v ) ) .",
    "+ this value is in very good agreement with @xcite , that gives e(b - v)=0.02 . +",
    "a further check to test the reliability of our t@xmath6 and log(g ) values was performed on arcturus , which is an important reference for every study on rgb stars .",
    "+ in order to have statistically independent estimations , we measured the atmospheric parameters on 3 high - resolution high - s / n spectra obtained with harps , the high precision spectrograph mounted at the 3.6 m telescope in la silla . + we obtained  t@xmath6=4290@xmath511 k  and log(g)= + 2.00@xmath50.02 as mean values and internal errors , which agree extremely well with literature values ( t@xmath6=4290@xmath530 k , log(g)=1.9@xmath50.1 , @xcite ) .",
    "+ our conclusion is that our t@xmath6 and log(g ) scales appear free from significant systematic errors .",
    "the linelists for the chemical analysis were obtained from many sources ( @xcite , vald & nistvald / php / vald.php and http://physics.nist.gov/physrefdata/asd/lines_form.html ] , @xcite , @xcite , spectrum , and scanuffegj/ ] ) , and calibrated using the solar - inverse technique by the spectral synthesis method .",
    "for this purpose we used the high resolution , high s / n noao solar spectrum @xcite . for ba lines we took the hyperfine splitting into account .",
    "we emphasize the fact that all the linelists were calibrated on the sun , including those used for the spectral synthesis .",
    "+ in particular , our determinations of c , n , o abundances are based on the g - band at 4310  , the cn lines at 8003  , and the forbidden o line at 6300   respectively .",
    "cn lines at 8003   were used also to estimate the c@xmath16/c@xmath17 ratio . + for the sun we have log@xmath18(c)=8.49 ,  log@xmath18(n)=7.95 , and log@xmath18(o)=8.83 , values that agree with @xcite within 0.03 dex .",
    "+ these three features were also checked on the high resolution , high s / n spectrum of arcturus by @xcite in order to verify if further blends affecting cool rgb stars but not the sun were present .",
    "we found no significant contamination .",
    "+ we obtained the following results for arcturus : [ c / fe]=-0.10@xmath50.05 ,  [ n / h]=+0.34@xmath5 + 0.05 , [ o / fe]=+0.38@xmath50.05 ( internal errors ) .",
    "these values well agree with @xcite , which gives [ c / fe]=+0.0@xmath50.1 , [ n / h]=+0.3@xmath50.1 , [ o / fe]=+0.4@xmath50.1 .",
    "we consider this as a test which proves the reliability of our linelists for c , n , o not only on sun - like stars , but also on cool rgb stars .",
    "+ abundances for c , n , and o were determined all together in an interactive way , because for the temperature of our stars , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen form molecules and as a consequence their abundances are related to each other .",
    "+ our c@xmath16/c@xmath17 estimation ( c@xmath16/c@xmath17@xmath1915 for all our targets ) confirm that the stars are affected by evolutionary mixing , as expected from their position in the cmd .",
    "this can affect the primordial c , n , o abundances separately , but not the total c+n+o content because these elements are transformed one into the other during the cno cycle .",
    "first of all , in fig .  [ f2 ] we plot the abundance of ba vs. fe . ( upper panel ) . in this plot",
    "we clearly see that the ba distribution is bimodal , while the iron abundance for the two ba groups is the same within the errors . in the following analysis",

    "<S> we present chemical abundance analysis of a sample of 15 red giant branch ( rgb ) stars of the globular cluster ngc  1851 distributed along the two rgbs of the ( v , v - y ) cmd . </S>",
    "<S> we determined abundances for c+n+o , na , @xmath0 , iron - peak , and s - elements . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the two rgb populations significantly differ in their light ( n , o , na ) and s - element content . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , they do not show any significant difference in their @xmath0 and iron - peak element content . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the two rgb populations do not show any significant difference in their total c+n+o content .    </S>",
    "<S> our results do not support previous hypotheses suggesting that the origin of the two rgbs and the two subgiant branches of the cluster is related to a different content of either @xmath0 ( including ca ) or iron - peak elements , or c+n+o abundance , due to a second generation polluted by sneii . </S>"
