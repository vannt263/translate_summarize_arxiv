    "there is a well grounded tradition of studying populations of hii regions in spiral and irregular galaxies , which goes back to the work of hodge , kennicutt , and their collaborators @xcite .",
    "it has become customary to measure their h@xmath0 luminosities and their radii , and prepare systematic catalogs . as techniques have improved and the precision of the measurements has increased the scope of the measurements has been gradually extended .",
    "the methods for discriminating an hii region from its diffuse surrounding emission have been improved , and the luminosity functions have been extended to lower limiting values . although the ultimate aim should be to improve our understanding of the star formation process and the interaction of , notably massive , stars with the ism , working on the improvement of the intrinsic data base is an objective intrinsically worth pursuing .",
    "considerable worthwhile ground based data have been reported ( a representative but in no way comprehensive list of references is : @xcite ) and , in the case of m33 , @xcite presented a list of over 9,000 detected regions in a single galaxy , but it is clearly of interest to analyze data of the quality and angular resolution provided by hst for this purpose .",
    "however relatively little work has been presented of this type , because the required narrow band filters at arbitrary recession velocities are not included in the optics of the hst instruments .",
    "a notable previous study of m51 based on wfpc2 narrow band imaging was presented by @xcite , and a parallel study of the same galaxy based on nicmos observations in pa@xmath0 was published by @xcite . in this article",
    "we use acs data for the first time to examine the statistical properties of hii regions in whole galaxies , presenting results for m51 , and also for the dwarf irregular ngc 4449 . in section 2",
    "we discuss how the archival data were processed in order to prepare the h@xmath0 maps , and in section 3 we describe the critically important processes of continuum and background subtraction , followed by the derivation of the luminosities , areas , and positions of the regions . in section 4",
    "we derive the luminosity - radius relations and the luminosity functions for both galaxies and the diameter distribution for m51 , and in section 5 we offer a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the images of m51 ( ngc 5194 ) and its companion ngc 5195 were observed with the wide field camera of the acs on hst in january 2005 within the program 10452 ( pi : steve beckwith , hubble heritage team ) .",
    "the observations consisted of 6 pointings through two broad band filters : f555w ( close to standard @xmath4 ) , and f814w ( close to @xmath5 ) , and a narrow band h@xmath0 filter , f658n .",
    "the exposures per pointing were 340s , 340s , and 680s for the three filters , respectively .",
    "the observations used here , taken from the hst archive , were corrected , calibrated , and combined by @xcite .",
    "the images of ngc4449 were also taken from the hst archive .",
    "they were taken during november 2005 through the same filters as those used for m51 , within the program go 10585 ( pi : alessandra aloisi ) .",
    "the exposures were taken at two different pointings along the axis of the galaxy , with four exposures per filter at each pointing , dithered to optimize the removal of cosmic rays and bad pixels , and to allow an improved determination of the point spread function .",
    "the total , integrated exposure times for the three filters , after combining the images using multidrizzle @xcite were 2400s , 2000s , and 360s respectively , in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and h@xmath0 .",
    "the total area imaged on the galaxy is 340@xmath6200 arcsec@xmath7 , with pixels of 0.05 arcsec .",
    "the archive data were processed _ on - the - fly _ , correcting for bias and dark current , flat - fielding , and correcting for non - linear effects using the standard pipeline calibration for acs ( calacs , @xcite ) .",
    "the images were also corrected for detector defects using multidrizzle , which also corrects each image for the distortion associated with each filter , and can then be used to combine images , and take out cosmic rays . for m51",
    ", these processes were performed by @xcite , but for ngc 4449 they were carried out by ourselves , with the help of iraf , which was employed to combine all the images for a given pointing and a given filter into single images before joining them in a mosaic to take in the whole galaxy .",
    "this was done by making use of the overlap zone in the pointings ( @xmath8 30 @xmath6 200 arcsec@xmath7 ) .",
    "the alignment errors were less than 0.3 pixels in any direction , which we derived from the differences in the centroids of the positions of the stars used for positional calibration .",
    "images processed with multidrizzle contain the signal in units of electrons / sec , and from the image headers one can find the sensitivity conversion factor , photflam , defined as the mean flux @xmath9 ( units of erg @xmath10 s@xmath3 @xmath3 ) , which yield 1 count per second in the observing mode used .",
    "any gain differences between the acs detectors are already accounted for by the photometric correction , so that to obtain a calibrated image in erg s@xmath3 @xmath10 @xmath3 one simply multiplies by the constant factor photflam . to convert this flux image into an hst magnitude one uses the expression    @xmath11    where the value of photzpt is the zero point on the st magnitude scale , and is usually listed in the image header , but can also be found on the acs website ( http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/ zeropoints ) .",
    "we list in table [ t : m1 ] the values of photflam and zpt for the three filters used @xcite .",

    "[ f : lum_func_a ] that the falling portion luminosity function of m51 at high luminosity could be well represented by a double linear fit , with a break point at luminosity 38.48 ( @xmath120.11 ) dex .",
    "the single fit described above has a coefficient of determination @xmath13 of 0.987 , while the double fit gives a coefficient of determination @xmath13 of 0.984 , which does not indicate that the double line fit is superior .",
    "the break is , however , defined more cleanly in the cumulative luminosity function , which we show here in fig .",
    "[ f : cumulative ] .",
    "breaks of this kind were first noted by @xcite who gave an estimated value for the break luminosity at @xmath14(h@xmath0 ) = 38.7 .",
    "they suggested , as did @xcite in his article on m51 , and @xcite that any galaxy would show the break , provided that it contained a sufficient number of hii regions of high luminosity .",
    "the latter authors termed the luminosity at the break the `` strmgren luminosity '' .",
    "@xcite found a value for this luminosity of @xmath14(h@xmath0 ) = 38.6 dex and @xcite in a study where they produced a summed luminosity function for almost 18,000 hii regions in 57 galaxies derived exactly the same value for the luminosity of the break point .    in order to see to",
    "what extent the value of the break point is affected by the bin size , we plotted the derived values against bin size , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : breaks ] and as complementary information the slopes of the shallower and steeper parts of the gradient , also against bin size , in fig .",
    "[ f : breaks_slopes ] .",
    "we can see that there is considerable stability in the value of the break luminosity for bins up to 0.28 dex in width , and a similar result holds for the slopes . taking the values for the break luminosity in the range of bin width from 0.1 dex to 0.28 dex we find a value for the `` strmgren luminosity '' of 38.52 ( @xmath120.14 ) dex . comparing our luminosity function with the very carefully measured ground based function of @xcite , we can see that the principal difference is that our sample is complete down to lower luminosities , and that we detect a larger number of small regions due to the superior resolution in the acs images , all of which is as expected .",
    "our study covers a slightly different fraction of the galaxy to that of rand ( the acs mosaic does not include the southernmost portion of the galaxy , but given the improved resolution of our data we did not need to cut out such a large radial portion of the galaxy near the center to take care of crowding ) , which is sufficient reason for the small discrepancy in the value of the break luminosity , though this is within mutual error limits .    for ngc 4449",
    "it is not possible to make a meaningful determination of a break luminosity , because of the paucity of high luminosity hii regions , in an object which is much smaller and less massive than m51 ( there are ten times fewer regions in ngc 4449 ) .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "6 that above @xmath2 = 38.52 , the value of our break luminosity in m51 , there is a sharp fall - off in the hii region population of ngc 4449 too , although the numbers are too small to merit a statistical treatment .      in fig",
    "[ f : cumulative_diameters ] we show the cumulative distribution of hii region diameters for m51 , defined as the sum of the numbers of regions with diameter greater than the plotted value .",
    "we have followed the functional form suggested first by van den bergh ( 1981 ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the integrated number of regions with diameters @xmath17 or greater , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants which quantify the distribution . in m51",
    "the range of diameters for the regions measured goes from 8.3 pc to 530 pc with a median value of 37.6 pc .",
    "if we fit a single function of this form to the points in fig .",
    "[ f : cumulative_diameters ] we find @xmath19 = 81.4 pc and @xmath18 = 2006 .",
    "however , as shown in the figure , we find a better fit by combining two curves of the same form , and in that case , for the curve which fits best in the range @xmath20 120 pc the parameters found are @xmath19 = 41.1 pc and @xmath18 = 3950 while for @xmath21 120 pc the corresponding parameter values are @xmath19 = 108.3 pc while @xmath18 = 556 .",
    "this graph suggests the possible presence of two population regimes .",
    "following our discussion of the break in the luminosity function , we could envisage the break point between the curves as possibly marking the difference between hii regions which are genuinely single , being ionized by a single ob cluster ( the range of diameters approaching 120 pc corresponds to regions which are far too bright and large to be produced by even the most massive single star ) and those which are compound , containing gas ionized by more than one cluster .",
    "another possible explanation is that the high luminosity curve represents exclusively the hii regions in the arms , while the lower luminosity curve represents the arm population with the addition of the regions in the interarm population .",
    "however , seeing fig .",
    "[ f : cumulative_diameters_separated ] , where we plot the cumululative distribution of hii region diameters separating the regions in the arms , in the interarms and in the 1 kpc central zone , we can conclude that this is unlikely .",
    "the fact that the break feature appears in the interarm regions as well as in the arm regions seems to low the possibility that exist a population in the arm and another in the interarm .",
    "among the more interesting results presented in this article is the dependence of the h@xmath0 luminosity of the hii regions , in both galaxies studied , on the square of the radius of the region , at least to zero order .",
    "this result is in conflict with the classical theory of the strmgren sphere or similar models , which predict that for regions of constant gas density the luminosity would be proportional to the cube of the radius , and in this context the simplest way to account for the result is to assume that the mean density of an hii region is inversely proportional to the square root of its luminosity .",
    "in fact an equivalent result was derived in a previous article , @xcite using the mean electron density of a region as a measure of the mean density of the region .",
    "this global interpretation is strengthened by the measured dependence of the mean electron density of the hii regions on galactocentric radius @xcite , which is a falling exponential with scale length equivalent to that of the neutral gas component .",
    "this demonstrates that , globally , the hii region population is in pressure equilibrium with its local gas column in the disk , so that the electron density is a useful indicator of the overall mean density of an hii region .",
    "however there is good evidence  @xcite that a significant fraction of the lyman continuum photons produced by the ob stars within the most luminous hii regions escape into the surrounding diffuse gas , an inference which is at least partially supported by the fraction of h@xmath0 emitted by the diffuse ism in ngc 4449 in the present article .",
    "this implies that a simple model for an hii region with uniform density is not satisfactory , as is in any case known from the difference between the local electron density , measured from emission line ratios , and the global mean electron density , measured using the h@xmath0 luminosity and the radius .",
    "the factor of an order of magnitude between the two densities is classically explained @xcite in terms of clumpy structure , with high density clumps producing the majority of the emission .",
    "the fractional volume occupied by the clumps , the `` filling factor '' is routinely used in calculations of radiation balance and abundance determination in hii regions . any realistic model to explain the luminosity volume relation must take this inhomogeneous structure into account .    a simple physical scheme would work as follows . if , at a given galactocentric radius the hii regions are in quasi - pressure equilibrium , but the mean density varies as @xmath22 this implies that the mean temperature varies as @xmath23 , which means that for a given luminosity @xmath14 the temperature varies as @xmath24 .",
    "the more luminous the region the more it is heated and the higher its internal gas temperature , though for a factor of 10 rise in luminosity this amounts to a factor of only 1.78 in kinetic temperature of the gas . as a consequence of this",
    "the more luminous regions are more tenuous , and the mean spacing between clumps will grow , and the low interclump gas density will fall , which leads to an increase in photon escape from the region . it may well be possible to quantify this scenario further , but we must defer this until the effects of dust extinction on all of the radiative processes involved can be quantified , which is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "we have used observations of two low redshift galaxies , m51 and ngc 4449 , with the acs on hst to quantify some of the principal physical characteristics of their populations of hii regions . for both galaxies",
    "we have produced catalogs of the luminosities in h@xmath0 , the projected areas , and center positions of the hii regions .",
    "for m51 the catalog contains 2659 regions , as the resolution and image quality of hst have allowed us to make a significant advance over previous ground based studies .",
    "our catalog goes down 0.6 dex in luminosity compared to the detailed ground based study by @xcite , and the number of regions measured is greater by a factor 4 . for ngc 4449",
    "we analyzed the emission from 273 regions , which is not in fact a striking quantitative advance on ground - based catalogs ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in this much less massive object with far fewer regions . from our databases we have derived the luminosity  volume ( or luminosity  radius ) relations for the regions of each galaxy , finding that in both cases the luminosity varies as the 2/3 power of the volume , ( i.e. as the square of the radius ) of the region . for a set of hii regions with constant uniform density",
    "the relation between luminosity and volume would have been linear .",
    "we can account for our result if the hii regions are globally in quasi pressure equilibrium with their surroundings , so that the mean electron density of a large and luminous region is less than that in a smaller less luminous region , because the mean temperature of the gas is larger in the former case .",
    "we have presented evidence for pressure equilibrium previously @xcite , as the measured electron density in the hii regions of our two measured galaxies varies with galactocentric distance with the same scale length as the neutral hydrogen , which would be the case for systems in pressure equilibrium .",
    "so there is a coherent qualitative explanation for the observed luminosity - volume relation , but a quantitative explanation for the simple relation found must await a more complete modelling exercise .",
    "we also present luminosity functions for the hii regions of both galaxies . above the completeness limit ,",
    "both functions show , to zero order approximation , a classical falling exponential . for m51",
    "there is clear evidence for a break in the exponential , at a luminosity of @xmath2 = 38.51 ( units in erg s@xmath3 ) with a steeper fall to higher luminosities confirming the previous finding by @xcite .",
    "the luminosity function for the interarm regions alone barely shows evidence for this break , but the number of highly luminous regions in this function is so small that it is not possible to state that the function is really distinct in form from the overall function for the galaxy , or from the function for the regions in the arms . for ngc 4449",
    "there is also a steepening of the luminosity function above 38.5 dex , but here again the numbers of regions are too small to show whether this is a physical effect or merely a statistical effect .",
    "explanations for the broken exponential , which has been reported previously in a number of papers , notably in @xcite , have included the blending of hii regions such that the largest regions absorb the smaller surrounding population @xcite and the increasing escape of ionizing photons from the larger regions @xcite .",
    "the first hypothesis does yield a broken exponential but when developed in due detail predicts a shallower outer slope rather than the steeper slope observed .",
    "the evidence presented here that the more luminous a region the lower is its electron density does give some indirect support to the second hypothesis , but further work , notably incorporating the effects of dust extinction on the ionizing photon budget , will be needed to clarify the situation .",

    "<S> we discuss briefly possible models which would give rise to this behavior , notably models with strong density inhomogeneities within the regions . plotting the luminosity functions for the two galaxies we find a break in the slope for m51 at @xmath2 = 38.5 dex ( units in erg s@xmath3 ) for m51 in good agreement with the previous ground - based study by rand , and above this luminosity ngc 4449 also shows a sharp decline in its luminosity function , although the number of regions is too small to plot the function well at higher luminosities . </S>",
