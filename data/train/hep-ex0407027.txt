    "the standard model has three flavors of massless dirac neutrinos @xmath3 .",
    "the results of neutrino oscillation measurements over the last decade have required that this simple picture be modified to allow mixing between the flavors and to add mass for the neutrinos .",
    "these modifications have opened up many questions that are currently being pursued experimentally .",
    "the questions include : what are the number of neutrinos ?",
    "are the masses majorana or dirac ?",
    "does the neutrino mass hierarchy follow that of the charged leptons ?",
    "why are the mixings so different from the quark sector ?",
    "the current experimental measurements in the solar ( @xmath4 ev@xmath1 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath5 ev@xmath1 ) regions combined with the lsnd result ( @xmath6 ev@xmath1 ) give three disparate mass squared differences .",
    "the three @xmath7 can not be explained with only three types of neutrinos since @xmath8 only - three models , where the atmospheric oscillations correspond to a mixture of oscillations at the @xmath9 and @xmath10 scales , are strongly disfavored by the current data since these models would demand a strong @xmath11 appearance signal that is not seen in the super - k atmospheric data .",
    "the solution to this inconsistency opens many possibilities .",
    "first , one of the experimental measurements could be wrong .",
    "the recent results from the sno and kamland experiments have substantiated the oscillation interpretation of the solar neutrino deficit , and the k2k experiment , although with large uncertainties , has seen a disappearance signal in the super - k atmospheric region .",
    "miniboone is in the process of exploring oscillations in the lsnd region and will make a definitive check of the lsnd anomaly .",
    "another possibility is that one of the experiments is not seeing neutrino oscillations but the results of another type of process such as neutrino decay ; or , for example , for lsnd , neutrino production from a lepton flavor violating decay .",
    "it also may be possible that this inconsistency has its origin in cpt violation which could imply that oscillations may be different for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the recent confirmation by kamland of oscillations in the solar region using reactor antineutrinos limits any cpt interpretation for the solar region . in the future , the minos experiment will be able to check cpt invariance for the oscillations in the atmospheric region by performing separate measurements with neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "an elegant solution that could explain the three distinct mass differences is the addition of one or more sterile neutrinos .",
    "sterile neutrinos are natural extensions to the standard model , and are demanded in many grand - unified theories , extra - dimension theories , and various types of lepton symmetry models .",
    "a confirmation that sterile neutrinos exist would have a major impact on our understanding of the neutrino sector and have far reaching effects on building models from unification to cosmology . also , additional sterile neutrinos could be a significant source of measurable cp violating effects and will make the neutrino oscillation phenomenology much more diverse .",
    "the phenomenology for adding extra sterile neutrinos involves broadening the mixing matrix and adding new extra mass values .",
    "the sterile neutrinos are weak isospin singlets and thus do not couple to either the standard w or z bosons .",
    "sterile neutrinos would therefore evade the lep bound on the number of light active neutrinos , and the detection of sterile neutrino effects could only take place through mixing with the standard active neutrinos . in the 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 schemes , additional sterile states are added with masses corresponding to the @xmath10 region . the high mass states are mainly composed of sterile components but can have small admixtures of active states as shown in figure  [ 3plusn ] .",
    "the extended neutrino mixing matrix is shown in figure  [ 3plusnmatrix ] , where the upper left @xmath12 components correspond to the usual active neutrino mixing matrix and the @xmath13 and @xmath14 components would contribute to an lsnd @xmath11 appearance signal through oscillation through the sterile neutrinos .",
    "[ ptb ]    3plusn.eps    [ ptb ]    3plusnmatrix.eps    a sterile neutrino has also been proposed to explain some small solar neutrino discrepancies such as the argon neutrino rate being two sigma smaller than expected and the lack of an upturn in the be neutrino rate at low energies@xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos may also be important in contributing to the rapid - neutron - capture process ( r - process ) in heavy element production by supernovae@xcite .",
    "the observed abundance of heavy elements is much larger than standard model predictions where the heavy element production is limited by the small size of the the neutron density .",
    "the neutron density can be increased in a model where matter effects cause more @xmath11 s to oscillate to sterile neutrinos than @xmath2 s .",
    "the excess of the @xmath2 s then produces a substantial neutron excess through the inverse beta decay process .",
    "big - bang nucleosynthesis and the anisotropy measurements of the cosmic microwave background give constraints on the number of neutrinos including sterile neutrinos .",
    "standard cosmological models using current measurements constrain the total number of neutrinos to be @xmath15 which can be somewhat relaxed to @xmath16 if the systematic uncertainty on the @xmath17he abundance is larger .",
    "these cosmological constraints can be evaded if the neutrinos have a lepton asymmetry or if equilibrium assumptions are not valid@xcite .",
    "in fact , hannestad has claimed that the lsnd result is not yet ruled out by cosmological observations  and has shown how the cosmological mass bounds would be increased from @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xmath20 ev if there are four ( five ) neutrinos instead of the usually assumed three@xcite .",
    "there have been many searches for neutrino oscillations in the high mass @xmath7 region associated with the lsnd result including the karmen , nomad , bugey , chooz , ccfr84 , and cdhs experiments .",
    "these experiments have set both appearance and disappearance limits on oscillations at various levels .",
    "global fits@xcite to these null short - baseline ( nsbl ) experiments plus the lsnd signal have been performed to determine the allowed regions in oscillation parameter space and answer the question if there are regions of compatibility . in these fits , lsnd is the only positive signal ( at the 3.8 @xmath21 level ) , but the cdhs experiment also shows a two sigma deficit in the near detector .    from fits to 3 + 1 models , a compatibility ( calculated from @xmath22 ) of 3.6% between lsnd and the nsbl experiments is obtained with the overlap regions shown in figure  [ 3plus1overlap ] .",

    "the 450-ton miniboone detector is located at l = 541 m from the production target , and the neutrino flux is produced from 8 gev fermilab booster protons impinging on a beryllium target giving neutrinos with a mean energy around 800 mev .",
    "compared to lsnd , miniboone neutrinos are produced from energetic ( not stopping ) pions and the signature and backgrounds for @xmath54 appearance are much different .",
    "as shown in figure [ mbbeam ] , the neutrino beam is produced by pion and kaon decays in a 50 m decay region downstream of single , magnetic - horn focusing system .",
    "the proton beam arrives at the production target within the horn during 1.6 @xmath55s beam spills that happens at about 5 hz .",
    "the miniboone detector shown in figure [ mbdetector ] consists of a 12.2 m diameter tank filled with pure mineral oil with the outer surface lined with 1280 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the fiducial volume corresponds to 450 tons of oil and is defined by a veto region instrumented with 240 pmts at the outer radii .",
    "neutrinos are identified and measured using the cerenkov and the small amount of scintillation light produced by outgoing charged tracks . the interaction point , time of an event , and the directions of relativistic tracks are reconstructed from the time and charge recorded in the pmts .",
    "particle identification is accomplished with a neural net that uses the difference in characteristics of the cerenkov rings and scintillation light associated with electrons , muons , protons , or @xmath56 s .",
    "most muon neutrino events can be easily identified by their penetration into the veto region or by their stopping and producing a michel electron after a few microseconds .",

    "the beam that arrives at the detector is almost all @xmath53 s with a small 0.6% contamination of @xmath11 s that mainly come from muon and kaon decay in the decay pipe . even though the kaon contribution is smaller than the muon",

    "several methods are used to calibrate the detector over the full energy range from 50 to 1000 mev .",
    "the spectrum of observed michel electrons from stopped muon decay yields a calibration point at the 53 mev michel endpoint .",
    "figure  [ michel ] shows good agreement between the data and expectation with an energy resolution of 15% at 53 mev .",

    "the agreement of the mass peak at 136.3 @xmath57 0.8 mev with the 135.0 mev expectation then gives a check on the energy scale over this range of photon energies .",
    "the miniboone collaboration is committed to performing a closed box  analysis for the @xmath11 appearance search . for this procedure ,",
    "the data events that could contain electron neutrinos in the oscillation signal region are separated off and not available for full detailed analysis . in this way ,",
    "inadvertent biases that might be introduced during the reconstruction development , tuning , and calibration can be avoided .",
    "data events in other categories such as muon and nc @xmath56 events are available for study . the plan is to complete the full development , calibration , and verification of the event reconstruction with monte carlo and the open data  before considering the closed box \"  events .",

    "the oscillation search is performed by comparing the shape of the energy distribution to the monte carlo expectation .",
    "the monte carlo expectation has inputs from measured pion production experiments for energies around 8 gev and from quasi - elastic cross section measurements . with an early data sample of 30,000 @xmath53 cc quasi - elastic events ,",
    "figure  [ numuqe ] shows a comparison of the measured quasi - elastic energy , @xmath60 , distribution in the data to monte carlo ( each normalized to unit area ) .",
    "the error bars on the monte carlo include the current assessment of the major sources of systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the errors include uncertainties associated with the @xmath53 flux , @xmath53 cc quasi - elastic cross section , and the properties of light production and transmission in the miniboone detector . substantial reductions of these uncertainties are expected as the analysis progresses . with the full data sample of several hundred thousand @xmath53 cc quasi - elastic events ,",
    "the estimated sensitivity to a disappearance signal is shown in figure  [ disappear ] along with the allowed regions from the previously described ( 3 + 1 ) sterile neutrino model fits . as that figure shows , the miniboone measurement will address important regions for the ( 3 + 1 ) and therefore also the ( 3 + 2 ) models .",
    "a prime goal of miniboone is to make a definitive search for neutrino oscillations in the lsnd parameter region by looking for an anomalous signal of @xmath11 appearance over background .",
    "the beam and detector have been designed to cover this region with good @xmath11 efficiency while minimizing backgrounds .",
    "an important feature of the miniboone design is to constrain all backgrounds through either internal or external data measurements as outlined below . for @xmath61 protons on target",
    ", the expected number of oscillation and background events is given in figure  [ events ] .",
    "one of the major sources of background events is the intrinsic electron neutrinos in the beam .",
    "this background @xmath11 flux comes from muon and kaon decay and is at the @xmath62 level with respect to the @xmath53 event rate . for the @xmath11 s from @xmath55-decay , the flux",
    "is directly tied to the observed @xmath53 flux , since the miniboone detector only subtends neutrinos from very forward pion decays .",
    "the pion energy distribution can then be determined from the observed @xmath53 events and used to predict the @xmath11 s from @xmath55-decay .",
    "the other major source of @xmath11 s is from @xmath63 decay .",
    "this source will be determined using data from two low energy production experiments that have recently taken data , the harp experiment at cern@xcite and the e910 experiment at bnl@xcite . with these production data",
    ", it is estimated that the @xmath11 flux from kaon decay can be determined with about a 5% uncertainty .",
    "an additional check will also be available from a special system , the little muon counters , that measures the decay muons from pion and kaon decay coming at wide angles from the decay pipe .",
    "the other major source of background events is nc @xmath56 production , where one of the gammas from the @xmath56 decay overlaps the other or is too low energy to be detected . over 99% of the nc @xmath56 events",
    "are rejected in the appearance analysis , and about 22% are fully reconstructed , which allows the overall number and kinematic distributions to be studied . as seen in figure  [ pi0mass ] , the invariant mass distribution is understood very well .",
    "the identified @xmath56 events in the data can then be used to extrapolate into the kinematic region of the background . as an example",
    ", figure  [ pi0asym ] shows the asymmetry distribution of the two photons for identified @xmath56 events for data and monte carlo ; the good agreement for events with large asymmetry gives confidence that this background can be understood .",
    "another handle on the background is the energy distribution of the various components as shown in figure  [ evtedist ] where the background is summed with a signal for a high ( low ) @xmath7 value of 1 ( 0.4 ) ev@xmath1 .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath11 events show a clear high energy tail which can be identified and the misidentified @xmath56 events are narrower in energy than an oscillation signal , so a fit to the energy distribution can be used to enhance the sensitivity to an oscillation signal .",
    "the miniboone sensitivity has been estimated by performing such energy - dependent fits to simulated data with no underlying oscillation signal .",
    "figure  [ osclimit ] shows the expected 90% , 3@xmath21 , and 5@xmath21 miniboone exclusion regions for an underlying null signal ; figure  [ oscsignal ] shows how well an oscillation signal can be measured at either low or high @xmath7 .                at the current time miniboone",
    "has collected about @xmath64 protons on target .",
    "the data collection rate is steadily improving as the booster accelerator losses are reduced .",
    "many improvements are being implemented into the booster and linac which not only help miniboone but also the tevatron and numi experiments .",
    "the miniboone collaboration plans to open the @xmath11 appearance box  when the analysis has been substantiated and when sufficient data has been collected for a definitive result ; this is expected to be sometime in 2005 .      whether or not miniboone sees an oscillation signal in neutrino running mode , it is also important to run with antineutrinos .",
    "antineutrino results will both directly address the lsnd anomaly , which was associated with a @xmath65 signal ; and allow investigations of possible cp or cpt violation effects .",
    "if miniboone sees a signal in neutrino mode , then it will be important to see if the mixings and @xmath7 values are the same for incident antineutrinos .",
    "the antineutrino event rate is about a factor of four lower than the neutrino rate for a given number of protons on target , but the @xmath56 and intrinsic @xmath11 backgrounds are significantly lower . because of these effects , one needs to run twice as long in antineutrinos to reach similar sensitivity as for neutrino running as shown in figure  [ osclimit_nubar ] .",
    "if miniboone sees an oscillation signal , the planned next step is to add a second detector at an optimal location ( 2 km for low @xmath7 or 0.25 km for high @xmath7 ) in order to explore the oscillation parameters ; this upgrade is referred to as the boone  experiment .",
    "this two ( or more ) detector setup would allow precision measurements of the parameters , @xmath7 to @xmath66 ev@xmath1 and @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ boonesignal ] shows an example measurement for an underlying @xmath7 value of 0.3 ev@xmath1 . with this sensitivity",
    ", there are many questions concerning the oscillation signal that the boone experiment will explore .",
    "the first question to address is if the signal is consistent with the l / e behavior expected for neutrino oscillations . in the ( 3+n ) type sterile neutrino models ,",
    "boone can determine how many separate @xmath7 there are .",
    "finally , with two detectors , boone can perform a much more precise @xmath53 disappearance search that would directly probe for indications of oscillations to sterile neutrinos .",
    "a positive miniboone signal will also prompt investigations by other experiments at fermilab , bnl , cern , and jparc .",
    "it will be important to map out the oscillations related to all three types of active neutrinos , @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 , in this high @xmath7 region with both appearance and disappearance measurements .",
    "a @xmath72 appearance experiment using , for example , an opera - style emulsion detector could explore this region but would require a higher energy neutrino beam to overcome the @xmath73 production threshold effects ; the numi 8 gev medium energy beam is a possibility .    in conclusion",
    ", neutrinos have provided many surprises over the past decade and will most likely continue to do so .",
    "although the neutrino standard model  can be used as a guide , the future direction for the field will be determined by what we discover from experiments .",
    "the possibility that sterile neutrinos exist may open up a whole new area to explore .",
