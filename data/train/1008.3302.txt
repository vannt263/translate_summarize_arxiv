    "with the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) and of coherent atomic beams all the questions inherent to the manipulation of such systems have acquired a certain importance . in particular ,",
    "early studies such as @xcite have started an interest in the manipulation of atomic structures via their interactions with coherent electromagnetic radiation .",
    "not only these studies could be of importance for applications such as atom interferometry , they also offer a possible test of the analogies between optics and quantum matter waves .",
    "in fact , becs provide us with a quantum system where matter waves can be realized on macroscopic scales and which , under the approximations of zero temperature , low densities , weak interactions and within the limits of validity of a mean field theory , is amenable to a mathematical description based on the gross - pitaevskii equation , completely akin to the basic equation of nonlinear optics , i.e. the nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xcite .",
    "the kerr - like nonlinearity is given for the atoms by the atom - atom interactions .",
    "it has been demonstrated that it is possible to reproduce typical optical and nonlinear optical phenomena with a a bec , from the generation of solitons to four - wave mixing , from parametric amplification to second harmonic generation , to mention only a few of them ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is possible to push the analogy even further and consider the electromagnetic radiation as the medium that allows for nonlinear interactions between atoms as discussed initially in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds exactly to the optics case where the medium through which radiation propagates can bring about nonlinear effects for the electromagnetic field : nonlinear effects in the dynamical evolution of the atoms and of the radiation are then a consequence of the atom - light interactions .",
    "models of this interaction were presented by several authors , @xcite and krutitsky _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite , gave a full derivation of the equations describing it starting from first principles within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "this last work showed the emergence of a resonant nonlinear term in the system dynamics as a consequence of the laser - atom dipole - dipole interaction , besides the well known kerr - like nonlinearity .",
    "the same equation for the atoms and consequently a coupled system of equations for the laser - atom system were rederived in @xcite , this time starting from a semi - classical theory .",
    "it was found there that the response of the  medium  , that is of the laser radiation , to the dynamics of the condensate could play an important role in the coupled evolution and even allow for the formation of mutually localizd atom - laser structures capable of propagating with no changes in the atom density and laser intensity , in spite of the assumed repulsive atom - atom interaction .",
    "such solitary - like structures are of interest bacause of their properties of self - localization and robust propagation and the effects of these interactions can be seen also in relation to the creation of meta - lenses and comoving potentials to refocus atom waves , @xcite .",
    "their emerging as a result of the coupling during propagation of atoms and laser was studied in @xcite while the stationary states of the coupled system and their stability properties were introduced in @xcite . however",
    ", little is known about their actual mechanism of formation . in the optics case of a focusing nonlineariry",
    ", we would expect an initial bell - shaped structure to shed away the radiation which can not be accomodated and to adjust asymptotically to a soliton wave .",
    "it is interesting to see whether the same happens in the present case of coupled atom - laser propagation and how , since the coupling may lead to novel effects .",
    "we have therefore studied numerically the process through which such coupled soliton - like objects are formed evidentiating the occurrence of a phenomenon reminiscent of soliton emission in nonlinear optics , @xcite .",
    "in fact , the equations analyzed here , predict the formation of solitary - like structures for both atoms and light which can move away from the region where they were generated .",
    "although in our case there is no external trapping but only the self - consistent interaction of atoms and laser , these results are suggestively similar to escaping solitons described and observed in completely different environments , for instance in nematic liquid crystals , @xcite .",
    "+ we will breafly review the basic physics of the semi - classical model and the limitations to be considered in sec.[sec : basics ] .",
    "sec.[sec : initial ] presents an investigation of the initial evolution of the coupled system which will than be studied numerically in sec.[sec : numerics ] .",
    "the basic physics of atom - laser interactions in the simplest dipole approximation is given by photons exciting atoms which in turn re - emit photons absorbed by other atoms , thus giving rise to a long - range interatomic interaction , @xcite .",
    "details of the semi - classical derivation of both the atom and the laser equations are given in @xcite , here we will only briefly review the two model equations and re - introduce the notation . in a semi - classical derivation , the force exerted by the light on the atoms is written as the gradient of a potential and this potential is used as the atom - laser interaction term in the hamiltonian for the atoms schrdinger equation .",
    "such force term is a generalization of the ponderomotive force and takes into account the possibility of an inhomogenoeus gas .",
    "the existence of stationary solutions is physically crucial so we will study a far - off resonant monochromatic field @xmath0 $ ] ( where @xmath1 is the complex amplitude of the laser field ) . the time averaged force ( over laser cycles ) is @xmath2 = -{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla } } v_d .",
    "$ ] here @xmath3 is the medium dielectric constant with atom density @xmath4 and is given by @xmath5 where , as derived from quantum theory , @xmath6 is the atomic polarizability at the laser frequency @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the detuning from the nearest atomic resonance frequency @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the dipole matrix element of the resonant transition,@xcite .",
    "the relative semplicity of the semi - classical derivation comes at the price of restricting the validity of the model to a well defined range of parameters : the concept of force is purely classical , therefore quantum fluctuations , stochastic heating and any incoherent process are to be neglected .",
    "this limits the validity of this model to large detunings @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the atoms natural line width ) . under these limitations ,",
    "the potential @xmath13 can be inserted into the atom gross ",

    "furthermore , since we are interested in the stationary behaviour of the system and we have already assumed a stationary form for the electromagnetic field , we will consider @xmath24 .",
    "the atom equation was already derived in @xcite within a fully quantum model and it is important to underline that , once the limitations of the semi - classical reasoning are taken into account , the two derivations lead to the same equation .",
    "+ to describe the role played by the electromagnetic field and the effect of the atoms on such field , it is necessary to include a field equation .",
    "maxwell s equations for the propagation of radiation in a medium , @xcite , yield a wave equation which , under the assumption of @xmath25 or @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the characteristic length scale of transverse density modulations and @xmath28 is the radiation wavelength ) , gives the three scalar equations ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30 when the input field distributions do no match the exact stationary solutions ( which can be found numerically , @xcite ) , propagation effects of some sort are to be expected . as demonstrated in @xcite , in the case of _ red detuning _ , the system settles down asymptotically to a stationary state with mutually localized atom - laser structures : starting from a gaussian atom density profile and a super - gaussian laser intensity one , the interaction leads to the formation of two bell - shaped structures which propagate unchanged thereon .",
    "this means that atoms and radiation in excess will be shed away , which is the process we would like to elucidate here .",
    "choosing @xmath31 as the propagation coordinate and limiting the investigation to slow envelope variation , we consider @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the dimension transverse to the propagation direction @xmath31 ( one transverse dimension only for simplicity ) , @xmath34 is the polarization vector of the field and @xmath35 is the atom wave number .",
    "the coupled system of equations ( [ eq : psi ] ) , ( [ eq : a ] ) , can then be written in normalized variables as @xmath36 @xmath37 where the following normalisation has been used : @xmath38 , for the atom wave function @xmath39 with @xmath40 , for the laser @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( for simplicity we will assume @xmath45 hereafter ) and @xmath46 . the tilde will be dropped hereafter unless otherwise stated . the red detuning case studied here",
    "will correspond to @xmath47 .",
    "notice that no mutual localization is possible in the blue detuning case . while the classical description for the laser field is justified by the choice of the intensity regime , for a mean field model to be valid for the atom wave function",
    ", we must consider not only a zero temperature limit but also a low density limit with @xmath48 , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a low density regime is required in order to avoid the singularity of the model and consequent spurious collapse - like phenomena .",
    "as done previously , we will start assuming an initial laser intensity profile in super - gaussian form much wider than the gaussian initial atom density profile , both of them definitely different from the stationary solutions of the system thus ensuring a dynamical evolution : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the supergaussian parameter ( @xmath51 in the simulations ) .",
    "the flat - top laser profile eliminates gradient forces on the atoms at the very initial stage .",
    "however , the flat top is immediately modified due to the natural evolution of the system and the initial steps will be the seed of the subsequent structure generation .",
    "the atoms will imprint a chirp on the laser with the effect of creating a central intensity peak with two lateral throughs , @xcite .",
    "this can be formally seen via a perturbative solution of the first propagation stage ( i.e. for @xmath52 ) . with @xmath53 ,",

    "this solution has the features observed in the initial evolution of the coupled system : the laser intensity profile changes in such a way as to peak in the center and at the same time two troughs are created on each side of the rising peak .",
    "the atom density profile shows the well known nonlinear defocusing behaviour - the center is depressed and two humps are created on both sides of the depression . this is the beginning of the creation of the stable mutually localized structures discussed in @xcite , in a soliton - like process",
    "the nonlinearity in the atom equation can act as a self - generated trapping potential for the bec .",
    "as a consequence of the initial evolution stage , provided the strenght of the focusing dipole - dipole interaction and that of the defocusing collisional nonlinearity are initially not completely out of balance , some atoms start to broaden away from the central structure while a part of the initial distribution remains trapped there .",
    "the radiation reacts to this process because of the dependence of the refactive index on the density profile and part of it is focused around the peak of the atom density .",
    "however , if the trap induced by the laser is much wider than the atom wave function , the atoms lost from the central core can still be trapped .",
    "what initially was a hump of disperding atoms , can get trapped in a secondary self - generated potential well and induce mutual localization on the wings .",
    "the generation of these secondary mutually localized structures , keeping the initial laser with and peak intensity fixed , should depend on having enough atoms escaping from the central peak since the escaping atoms must affect the laser wings to provoke the formation of the secondary trap .",
    "therefore we have numerically studied the coupled evolution of ( [ eq : initialpsi ] ) and ( [ eq : initiala ] ) for fixed @xmath67 and fixed @xmath68 corresponding to an initial peak laser intensity of @xmath69 mw/@xmath70 , but varying @xmath71 . in the simulations we have",

    "the central atoms affect the laser profile which creates a trapping potential .",
    "the atoms that escape this trap are not enough to modify the natural evolution of the laser wings which undergo well known modulations before diffracting away . increasing @xmath71 , the central structure generated by the system will be obviously modified , the balance of repulsive collisional interactions and attractive dipole forces has changed .",
    "furthermore , the effect of escaping atoms becomes stronger to the point that the same trapping mechanism can now be realized on the sides of the central peak .",
    "fig.[fig : run30020019_3102130301 ] shows the results of such an interaction for two values of @xmath76 the laser , as one would expect , forms analogous localized structures in correspondence of the atom density peaks .",
    "there is actually a formation of localized structures even for low @xmath71 , the very low density of escaping atoms can focus extremely weak laser peaks , the process creates continuous families of mutually localized solutions .",

    "in conclusion , proceeding from the idea that laser - bec dipole - dipole interactions can lead to mutually localized structures , we have analyzed in detail the mechanism of formation of such structures concentrating on the process through which the structures shed away the extra atoms and extra radiation .",
    "numerical simulations seem to indicate the possibility of generating and emitting secondary solitary - like wave packets in a jet - like fashon .",
    "although the model used here is strongly simplified and any comparison with experiment will require major refinements , the equations we have used enlighten the main physical effects and it seems possible to choose parameter regimes in which the effects neglected here will not destroy these results .",
    "this processes could be a further evidence of the analogy between matter waves and optical waves and even open the discussion about applications such as soliton stirring in becs .",
