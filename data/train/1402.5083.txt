    "is an extensive literature on experiments performed with dense plasma focus ( dpf ) machines , exploring both fundamental z - pinch physics @xcite and applications of the dpf to fields like x - ray lithography @xcite , fusion energy @xcite , and modeling of astrophysics @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the vast majority of research has been driven by theory and experimentation , but there is a shift towards developing new experiments informed by computational models and simulations .",
    "many of the simulations that have been used to design dpf experiments are 1-dimensional , in the sense that current , temperature , or expected neutron yield are computed as a function of a single parameter being varied @xcite .",
    "there has also been work to develop codes that are capable of full magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) modeling of the inverse pinch and run - down phases of the dpf reaction on spatial domains ( see section [ sec : setup ] for descriptions of the reaction phases ) , and there exist 2d simulations modeling the physics of the dpf , which are often extended to 3d assuming axial symmetry @xcite . despite some success with 1d and 2d simulations , fully 3d simulations of the mhd phases of the dpf",
    " which do not impose symmetry on the physics of the reaction  are difficult , and the literature presenting the results of such simulations is sparse .",
    "there are a number of challenges in the 3d modeling , including the computational complexity of the problem , a need for appropriate initial conditions to ignite the inverse pinch , insufficient equation of state ( eos ) data for the working gas and the electrodes , and incorporating radiative effects into the mhd model .    in a dpf",
    ", a working gas is charged , forming a plasma , that travels down an anode surrounded by a cathode , and the speed that the plasma shock travels down the anode is determined by the initial pressure and voltage in the system .",
    "the z - pinch occurs when the plasma shock gets to the end of the anode .",
    "the energy available to the z - pinch is maximized when the current through the dpf is maximized , which means that the rundown time is one of the most important quantities to properly simulate .",
    "if simulations correctly predict rundown for a given initial pressure and voltage configuration , those settings can be used in actual experimentation ensuring that the z - pinch occurs with maximum energy , which in turn results in maximum neutron yield .",
    "the neutron yield can be determined experimentally using a beryllium activation detector @xcite ( for deuterium fusion ) , or a praseodymium activation detector @xcite ( for deuterium - tritium fusion ) .",
    "further , when deuterium , or deuterium - tritium mixtures are used as a fill gas , the neutron yield has a power - law relationship @xcite with the maximum current , which means that it is also important to be able to faithfully simulate the maximum current . for these reasons , most of our analysis centers on comparing experimentally - measured current waveforms to the simulated current waveform .",
    "in this work , we present simulation results of a fully 3d mhd model of a dpf using the alegra @xcite multiphysics code developed at sandia national laboratories .",
    "the simulations are run in both 2d and 3d , and the results are compared to each other as well as to experiments run in the dpf lab at national security technologies , llc .",
    "the predictions of the 2d and 3d computations are qualitatively and quantitatively different , as the 2d simulations show systematically lower inductance , which results in systematically higher currents but unrealistically fast rundown times .",
    "the 3d simulations predict lower maximum current values but accurately represent the true rundown time shown in experimental data .",
    "this demonstrates that , despite the symmetric geometry of the machine , there are three - dimensional effects present in the mhd physics that must be accounted for in order to faithfully predict the outcome of dpf experiments .",
    "the dpf used in our experiments , and the geometry of which was modeled in the simulations , is formed of coaxial electrodes in a rarified deuterium atmosphere ( about 7 torr ) .",
    "a two - stage marx capacitor bank is charged , and when discharged , breaks down the gas , forming a shock and starting the `` inverse pinch '' phase of the reaction , in which the gas expands outward from the anode to the cathode bars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dpf ] ) .",
    "once the gas touches the cathode , the `` run - down '' phase begins , and the plasma moves up the anode until it z - pinches at the top of the anode .",
    "these two phases , the inverse pinch and rundown , are approximately governed by magnetohydrodynamics and are the components of the reaction that are studied and simulated .",
    "[ fig : dpf ] shows the dpf setup used in our experiments . the outer electrode ( cathode )",
    "is formed of 24 copper bars , 0.375 inches thick and 30.75 inches tall , in a ring with an inside diameter of 6 inches .",
    "the cathode is at ground potential , and its bars are shorted at the top with a ring of copper . the anode is a hollow copper tube with an outer diameter of 4 inches that stands 23.6 inches above the ground plane , capped with a hemisphere .",
    "the vacuum chamber is 1 foot in diameter , and roughly 6 inches taller than the cathode cage . a pyrex insulator tube , which is about 0.5 inches thick and stands 8.63 inches above the cathode base , separates the anode and cathode .",
    "the dpf is driven by a two - stage marx capacitor bank , which is connected to the plasma focus tube by 36 coaxial cables .",
    "the total capacitance of the bank ( when configured for discharge ) is 432 @xmath1f , and the maximum total voltage in discharge configuration is 70 kv , which makes the maximum stored energy of the bank 1 mj .",
    "the plasma shock is driven by an external circuit , and the circuit model used in the mhd simulations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit diagram ] .",
    "the discharge switch in the circuit represents a collection of eight rail - gap switches that are simultaneously triggered by a single spark gap .",
    "the series inductance represents the transmission lines that feed power to the plasma focus tube and was determined empirically by fitting exponentially - dampened sine waves to the experimental data . the 10 nf capacitor in series with the small resistor represents the imperfect capacitance of the terminal plates and the transmission lines that supply the power to the plasma focus tube .",
    "the 120 @xmath2 resistor in parallel with the plasma focus tube is the equivalent parallel resistance of the safety resistors .",
    "the discharge current diagnostic is important for comparing simulations to experiment , because it allows for the measurement of both the maximum current through and rundown time of the dpf .",
    "as was noted above , these are two of the most important quantities for simulations in order to accurately predict neutron yield and to ensure that the maximum current runs through the system at the time of the z - pinch . on the nstec dpf",
    ", the discharge current is measured with a faraday rotator @xcite , which uses the magnetically - induced linear polarization rotation in quartz fibers to measure the current in a circuit .",
    "the fiber is wound in a circular fashion around the anode , an orientation that causes the fiber to follow the direction of the magnetic field , allowing it to accurately measure the current . in ( [ faraday ] ) , the polarization rotation angle , @xmath3 ( in radians ) , is related to the permeability of the vacuum , @xmath4 , the current , @xmath5 , the verdet constant of the fiber , @xmath6 , and the number of loops the fiber makes around the anode @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction of the magnetic field , @xmath8 , with an element of the fiber s length , @xmath9 , is then integrated over the path of the fiber around the anode . in our arrangement",
    ", the fiber wraps around the anode @xmath10 turns .",
    "this path is denoted by @xmath11 , and since the fiber is either parallel with the magnetic field or perpendicular to it , the rotation angle is    @xmath12    in mksa units .",
    "the faraday rotator current diagnostic is perferred over other discharge current measurements , such as the rogowski coil , because the faraday rotator gives current measurements that are not dependent on calibration factors , but rather on an easily measurable geometric quantitiy : the number of turns around the current to be measured .",
    "the only other factor that must be determined is the verdet constant for the fiber , which can either be measured or obtained from a datasheet on the fiber . when properly set up , the faraday rotator is a reliable diagnostic .",
    "[ fig:37_compare ] shows experimentally - measured results from the faraday rotator detector for 37 dpf shots initiated with the same voltage and pressure .",
    "as can be seen , the profiles are all nearly identical , which demonstrates both the shot - to - shot consistency of the dpf and the reliability of the faraday diagnostic .",
    "the placement of the faraday loop is important for understanding the current that it measures .",
    "this is easier to show than it is to describe , so this is included as fig .",
    "[ fig : faraday setup ] .",
    "the modeling for this project was performed with sandia national laboratories alegra - mhd code .",
    "alegra is a finite - element , multi - material , arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ( ale ) shock hydrodynamic code designed for parallel computing .",
    "it uses an operator - split edge - element formulation to simulate resistive mhd in 2d and 3d high - deformation shocked media and pulsed power systems .",
    "alegra provides fine control over how the simulation is performed through a text file known as the `` input deck . ''",
    "the primary purpose of the input deck is to define the simulation geometry , material composition , and physics to be modeled , though it also allows a user to request output and provide runtime controls .",
    "part of defining the physics of a simulation is setting up the equations of state for the gases , which was among the most challenging aspects of the problem .",
    "tabular equations of state provide the most effective means of modeling the thermodynamic state of material in the simulations , which may be in the solid , liquid , gaseous , or ionized state .",
    "tabular eos models were made available through alegra s interface to los alamos national laboratory s sesame @xcite data .",
    "tabular representations of the lee - more - desjarlais ( lmd ) electrical and thermal conductivity model @xcite were also used here .",
    "the lmd model combines empirical data with inferences from quantum molecular dynamics modeling and density functional theory ( qmd - dft ) to provide a conductivity representation that spans the transition between conducting and insulating conditions and has proven quite successful in this `` warm dense matter '' regime @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to defining the geometry on which to simulate the reaction using algera .",
    "the first is using alegra s built - in functionality , by declaring pre - defined volumetric shapes ( like spheres , prisms , pyramids , etc . ) and defining the material composition of each shape .",
    "for example , many dpf machines have cylindrical copper cathode bars , and it is possible to define in the input deck a cylinder made of copper .",
    "the code then generates a 2d or 3d unstructured mesh that overlays the defined shapes , allowing for mesh elements to intersect more than one user - defined shape .",
    "the second approach to defining the geometry is by performing the computation on a body - fitted mesh generated using an external meshing tool .",
    "the body - fitted mesh method is a more accurate method of describing the material in the simulation volume , but is more time - consuming to set up than the geometric method .",
    "alegra s built - in functionality was used to define the geometry and material composition in all of the simulations shown in what follows , and boundary conditions are specified on subsets of nodes or faces within the simulation volume .    in any simulation , it is important that the geometry and the physics being simulated reflect the important geometries and physics of the experiment , and both raise several concerns in our simulations .",
    "for example , it is not necessary to include a faithful model of the vacuum chamber in our simulations , since the plasma does not interact with the top of the chamber during the simulation . evaluating the physics being modeled , it is important to understand that the plasma in the dpf reaction is driven by an external electrical network , and a great strength of the alegra - mhd code is that it has a sophisticated built - in circuit solver that can be used to couple electrical energy from user - specified circuits into the simulation volume .    near the end of the simulation , just prior to the z - pinch",
    ", the mhd simulation begins to become unphysical because of its inability to represent certain phenomena , such as , the kinetic instabilities which raise the plasma resistivity .",
    "the simulation may run past the point of z - pinch without crashing , but the time - evolution of the simulation would be unphysical . once the mhd simulation begins to approach the z - pinch ,",
    "it is possible to transfer the model state information to a particle - in - cell model to accurately simulate the z - pinch , which has been demonstrated by researchers at llnl@xcite and snl@xcite .",
    "setting up the initial condition for the simulation can also be tricky , since the dpf s starting state happens when the gas in the chamber breaks down in the vicinity of the insulating sheath and becomes a ring - shaped plasma shock .",
    "the breakdown of the gas is not covered by mhd physics , so the gas near the insulator has to be initialized in an artificial state that will quickly transition to the plasma shock known experimentally to exist in the dpf .",
    "we have found that setting up a thin layer of extremely hot ( @xmath13 k , and therefore conductive ) gas on the surface of the insulator results in the simulation initiating a plasma shock without causing observable artifacts in the time evolution of the simulation .",
    "our experience with this initial condition is that the thin layer of hot gas should be about as thin as the pyrex insulator and should touch both the anode and the cathode . using this initiation of the plasma shock results in temperatures that match data from particle - in - cell calculations @xcite .",
    "the artificially hot gas layer should stabilize its temperature near the shock temperature , @xmath14 , within a few solver timesteps ( typically , about 20 nanoseconds ) .",
    "one and two dimensional models of the dpf are the most common in the literature , frequently coming in two generic types : empirical models and finite - element mhd models .",
    "the primary strength of empirical models , such as radpfv5.5de @xcite , or scat95",
    "@xcite is that they give results that are often very close to experimental data .",
    "a significant drawback is that they require existing data to fit the model to , and can therefore only be used to simulate devices that are quite similar to the devices that one has experimental data for already . the second class",
    "are finite - element codes such as mhrdr @xcite and mach2 @xcite that perform mhd modeling in one or two dimensions or in axis - symmetric 3d .",
    "fully 3d mhd codes are not new , but can be hard to obtain and are usually more difficult to operate than 2d codes",
    ". results of fully-3d dpf modeling are not well represented in the literature .    in many experimental realizations of the dpf ,",
    "the cathode is a cylinder composed of metallic bars . while the plasma shock is traveling down the tube during rundown , the plasma spills outside of the anode - cathode gap through the spaces between the bars , a phenomenon that can be seen in the framing camera picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : framing camera ] .",
    "this can be approximated in 2d simulations , but in practice it is difficult to predict the time evolution of an actual dpf using these approximations .",
    "simulations in 2d also impose other geometric constraints : the current density must either be completely in the radial - axial plane , or perpendicular to it , but not both at the same time .",
    "this precludes modeling situations that may have currents flowing helically , or situations in which the current may be flowing asymmetrically or off - axis .",
    "these restrictions on 2d simulations are often not of concern to investigators , who may want to ensure symmetry and simplicity in their experiments in order to simplify the data they collect",
    ". nonetheless , the most general , physically realizable simulations are essential for complete understanding .",
    "the 2d simulation that was run in alegra made the _",
    "ad hoc _ assumption that there was a lower density floor below which the material was assumed to have no electrical or thermal conductivity .",
    "the floor was set at a density of 2.5@xmath1510@xmath16 kg / m@xmath17 , which was was necessary in order to eliminate unphysical behavior in the simulation .",
    "the lmd model for deuterium plasma , shown in figure [ fig : lmd ] , attributes moderate electrical conductivity to the plasma at this density for temperatures higher than approximately 1 ev , and this behavior is suppressed here , in order to cause the plasma shock to travel properly down the anode of the dpf .",
    "fully 3d magnetohydrodynamic codes are available , such as alegra and nimrod @xcite , among others , and the benefit of using these codes is that the electrode geometry in the dpf can be modeled and simulated .",
    "the ability to investigate the effects of electrode structures without presupposing symmetries allows investigators to gain deeper understanding into how the plasma shock evolves over time .",
    "the primary drawback of 3d mhd modeling is the computational complexity of solving the mhd equations on large meshes , requiring computer clusters to perform simulations in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "similar to the 2d modeling , the 3d modeling in alegra required the imposition of a density floor at 2.5@xmath1510@xmath16 kg / m@xmath17 in the electrical and thermal conductivity models .",
    "[ fig : density slice ] shows a representation of the material density midway through the rundown phase of the dpf in both the 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "the 2d modeling assumes axial symmetry , and the symmetry axis in both simulation volumes is on the far left - hand side . in the both simulations ,",
    "the cathode bars are represented as rectangles on the right of the simulation domain , and the plasma shock travels from the bottom of the image to the top of the image , where it z - pinches slightly above the hemispherical anode top .",
    "the plasma can not flow around the cathode bars in the 2d simulation as it can in the 3d simulation .",
    "the 3d simulation simulates the entire gas volume of the chamber , and it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : density slice ] that the plasma is slightly slower and less dense in the 3d simulation than in the 2d simulation .",
    "the larger inductance results in longer rundown times and lower maximum current as compared to the 2d simulation , if all other system parameters are equal .",
    "fig . [ fig:2d_compare ] shows the current profiles from a 3d simulation , two 2d simulations , and from the faraday diagnostic of an actual experimental run .",
    "the `` simulated current '' in 2d ( red , dashed line ) and 3d ( yellow , dash - dotted line ) were both initiated using the same voltage and pressure as the experimental data .",
    "the 2d simulation predicts a peak current of 2.08 ma , which differs from the peak current measured by the faraday diagnostic ( 2.17 ma ) by only 4% .",
    "the 3d simulation systematically predicts lower peak currents , due to the higher inductance of the plasma escaping the cathode bars , and estimates peak current at 1.82 ma , an error of approximately 16% .",
    "thus , for estimating peak current , the 2d simulation is more accurate than the corresponding 3d simulation .    the more important quantity of interest , however , is the duration time of the rundown phase of the reaction .",
    "the end of the rundown phase is defined at the point of maximum derivative of the current profile , which is 6.96 @xmath1sec for the experimental data .",
    "the 3d simulation predicts 6.69 @xmath1sec , an error of less than 4% , whereas the 2d simulation predicts a rundown time of 5.59 @xmath1sec , an error of almost 20% , showing that the 3d simulation vastly outperforms the 2d simulation in predicting this quantity .",
    "the two primary inputs into the alegra simulation that we have discussed so far are the initial voltage and pressure , since these are the adjustable initial conditions of the dpf machine .",
    "the simulation allows for other quantities to be tweaked as well , though , and it is natural to adjust the model parameters to attempt to match the experimental data more closely .",
    "this is difficult with the 3d simulations , since they are too computationally intensive to `` tweak '' parameters one at a time and analyze the changes in output . for the 2d simulations , however , this is possible , and fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_compare ] shows the results of a 2d simulation ( `` tweaked current , '' pink dotted line ) that was designed to match the rundown time of the experimental results .",
    "this required that the series inductance be adjusted from 25 nh to 28.2 nh .",
    "note that there is no experimental justification for this change , it is done just to show that the true rundown time can be achieved with a 2d simulation .",
    "this simulation does not outperform the 3d , however , since the 2d simulation matching the experimental rundown time results in a far inferior peak current measurement .",
    "thus a small improvement in rundown time over the 3d gives a large degradation in peak current .",
    "naturally one should use simulation input parameters that represent the experiment being simulated as faithfully as possible , and the story of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d_compare ] is that 2d simulations of a dpf can give quite good results when the peak current is the quantity of interest .",
    "when the rundown time is of interest , which is more often the case , it is necessary to use the fully 3d simulation to accurately predict the rundown time of an experiment . for comparison",
    ", a scat95 simulation was iteratively adjusted to match the experimental data .",
    "while the agreement is good for this simulation , the parameters used in the match are only good matches for geometries and setups that are close to this particular case .",
    "otherwise scat95 achieves results that are similar to the 2d mhd simulations .",
    "in this work we have presented results of fully 3d predictive simulations of a dense plasma focus , using the alegra mhd code from sandia national laboratories . as opposed to 2d or axis - symmetric 3d simulations",
    ", the fully 3d models more faithfully predict the duration of the rundown phase of the dpf , which is essential for ensuring that the maximum current runs through the system at the time of z - pinch , which is required to accurately predict neutron yield .",
    "the 2d simulations are appropriate for predicting the peak current in the dpf , but are not capable of matching both the peak current and rundown time simultaneously .",
    "the authors would like to thank aaron luttman for helpful comments and suggestions on the manuscript .",
    "we would also like to thank chris hagen for providing support and encouragement for this project , as well as his insight into the theoretical and experimental operation of the dpf .",
