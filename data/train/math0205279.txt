    "the present paper studies the possibility of determining the geometrical aspects of a discrete physical structure whose interior is accessible only through a small number of measurements of the atoms lying along a fixed set of directions .",
    "this is the central theme of _ discrete tomography _ and the principal motivation of this study is in the attempt to reconstruct three - dimensional crystals from two - dimensional images taken by a transmission electron microscope .",
    "the quantitative analysis of these images can be used to determine the number of atoms in atomic lines in certain directions  @xcite .",
    "the question is to deduce the local atomic structure of the crystal from the atomic line count data .",
    "the goal is to use the reconstruction technique for quality control in vlsi ( very large scale integration ) technology . before showing the results of this paper ,",
    "we give a brief survey of the relevant contributions in discrete tomography .    clearly , the best known and most important part of the general area of tomography is _ computerized tomography _ , an invaluable tool in medical diagnosis and many other areas including biology , chemistry and material science .",
    "computerized tomography is the process of obtaining the density distribution within a physical structure from multiple x - rays .",
    "more formally , we attempts to reconstruct a density function @xmath0 for @xmath1 in @xmath2 or @xmath3 from knowledge of its line integral @xmath4 for lines @xmath5 through the space . this line integral is the _ x - ray _ of @xmath0 along @xmath5 .",
    "the mapping @xmath6 is known as the _ radon transform_. the mathematics of computerized tomography is quite well understood .",
    "appropriate quadratures  @xcite of the radon inversion formula are used , with concepts from calculus and continuous mathematics playing the main role .",
    "usually , the physical structure has a very big variety of density values , and so a large number of x - rays are necessary to ensure the accurate reconstruction of their distribution . in some cases the structure that we want to reconstruct has only a small number of possible values .",
    "for example , a large number of objects encountered in industrial computerized tomography ( for the purpose of non - destructive testing or reverse engineering ) @xcite are made of a single homogenous material . in many of these applications there",
    "are strong technical reasons why only a few x - rays of the structure can be physically determined .",
    "_ discrete tomography _ is the area of computerized tomography in which these special cases are studied .",
    "the name discrete tomography is due to larry shepp , who organized the first meeting devoted to the topics in 1994 .",
    "an example of such a case is the above - mentioned problem of determining local atomic structure of a crystal from the atomic line count data . in a simple but highly relevant model suggested by peter schwander and larry",
    "shepp the possible atom locations in a unit cell of a crystal are defined on the integer lattice @xmath7 , while the electron beams are modeled as lines parallel to a given direction .",
    "the presence of an atom at a specific location corresponds to a pixel value one at the location ; the absence of an atom corresponds to a pixel value zero .",
    "the number of atoms along certain lines through the crystal ( i.e. , the sum of pixel values along those lines ) define the _ discrete x - rays _ of the atomic structure with respect to the family of lines involved . since in practice , one degree of freedom for moving the imaging device is used to control the position of the crystal , the view directions for which data are provided lie all in the same plane .",
    "this means that the 3d - problem leads itself to a 2d - slice - by - slice reconstruction .",
    "therefore , the crystal is represented by a binary matrix and its discrete x - ray along a direction @xmath8 is an integral vector giving the sum of its elements on each line parallel to @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "= 10.5 cm    measurements are usually only available along two , three or four directions , which is much less than what is typical used in computerized tomography ( a few hundred ) . in fact , the electron microscope makes measurements at the atomic level and uses high energy ( and so deeply penetrating ) rays which can corrupt the crystal itself .",
    "so , it can take only two , three or four images of the crystal before the energy of the radiations destroys it , or at least changes permanently its atomical configuration so that the subsequent radiations will see something different from the original one .",
    "now , the problem is to invert the _ discrete radon transform _ , i.e. , to reconstruct the binary matrix from this small set of discrete x - rays .",
    "more precisely , the basic question is to determine , given a set of directions @xmath9 and a set of integral vectors @xmath10 , whether there exists a binary matrix @xmath11 whose discrete x - rays along @xmath12 are @xmath13 .",
    "the general methods of computerized tomography can not be used effectively if the number of x - rays is so small , and they seems unlikely to work in practice .",
    "discrete tomography has its own mathematical theory mostly based on discrete mathematics .",
    "it has some strong connection with combinatorics and geometry .",
    "we wish to point out that the mathematical techniques developed in discrete tomography have applications in other fields such as : image processing  @xcite , statistical data security  @xcite , biplane angiography  @xcite , graph theory  @xcite and so on . as a survey of the state of the art of discrete tomography we can suggest the book  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , mathematicians have been concerned with abstract formulations of these problems before the emergence of the practical applications .",
    "many problems of discrete tomography were first discussed as combinatorial problems during the late 1950s and early 1960s . in 1957",
    "ryser  @xcite and gale  @xcite gave a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of vectors being the discrete x - rays of a binary matrix along horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "the discrete x - rays in horizontal and vertical directions are equal to _ row _ and _ column sums _ of the matrix .",
    "they gave an exact combinatorial characterization of the row and column sums that correspond to a binary matrix , and they derived a fast @xmath14 time algorithm for reconstructing a matrix , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote its sizes .",
    "we refer the reader to an excellent survey on the binary matrices with given row and column sums by brualdi  @xcite .",
    "the space of solutions of the reconstruction problem , however , is really huge and in general quite impossible to control .",
    "a good idea may seem to start increasing the number of x - rays one by one in order to decrease the number of solutions .",
    "unfortunately , the reconstruction problem becomes intractable when the number of x - rays is greater than two , as proved in @xcite .",
    "this means that ( unless @xmath17 ) exact reconstructions require , in general , an exponential amount of time . in polynomial time",
    "only approximate solutions can be expected . in this context , an approximate solution is close to the optimal one if its discrete x - rays in the set of prescribed directions are close to those of the original set .",
    "various approaches have been suggested for solving the problem  @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting method  @xcite for finding an approximate solutions has been proposed . even though the reconstruction problem is intractable , some simple algorithms proposed in @xcite have good worst - case bounds and they perform even better in computational practice .",
    "unluckly , this is not still enough . during the last meeting devoted to discrete tomography , gabor t. herman  @xcite and peter gritzmann  @xcite stress the fact that various approaches have been suggested for solving the general problem of reconstructing binary matrices that are given by their discrete x - rays in a small number of directions , but more work has to be done to handle the ill - posedness of the problem . in fact , the relevant measure for the quality of a solution of the problem would be its deviation from the original matrix . hence in order to establish this deviation we would have to know the real binary matrix .",
    "however , the goal is to find this unknown original binary matrix so we can only consider measures for the quality of a solution based on the given input discrete x - rays .",
    "we have a good solution in this sense if its discrete x - rays in the prescribed directions are close to those of the original matrix .",
    "unfortunately , if the input data do not uniquely determine the matrix even a solution having the given discrete x - rays may be very different from the unknown original matrix .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that extremely small changes in the data may lead to entirely different solutions .",
    "consequently , the problem is ill - posed , and in a strict mathematical setting we are not able to solve this problem and get the correct solution .    in most practical application",
    "we have some a priori information about the images that have to be reconstructed .",
    "so , we can tackle the algorithmic challenges induced by the ill - posedness by limiting the class of possible solutions using appropriate prior information .",
    "the reconstruction algorithms can take advantage of this further information to reconstruct the binary images .",
    "a first approach is given in @xcite , where it is posed the hypothesis that the binary matrix is a typical member of a class of binary matrices having a certain gibbs distribution .",
    "then , by using this information we can limit the class of possible solutions to only those which are close to the given unknown binary matrix .",
    "a modified metropolis algorithm based on the known gibbs prior provides a good tool to move the reconstruction process toward the correct solution when the discrete x - rays by themselves are not sufficient to find such solution .",
    "a second approach modelled a priori information in terms of a subclass of binary images to which the solution must belong .",
    "several papers study the problem on classes of binary matrices having convexity or connectivity properties . by using these geometric properties",
    "we reduce the class of possible solutions . for instance , there is a uniqueness result  @xcite for the subclass of _ convex binary matrices _",
    "( i.e. , finite subsets @xmath11 of @xmath18 such that @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is proved that a convex binary matrix is uniquely determined by its discrete x - rays in certain prescribed sets of four directions or in any seven non - parallel coplanar directions .",
    "moreover , there are efficient algorithms for reconstructing binary matrices of these subclasses defined by convexity or connectivity properties . for example",
    ", there are polynomial time algorithms to reconstruct _ hv - convex polyominoes _  @xcite ( i.e. , two - dimensional binary matrices which are 4-connected and convex in the horizontal and vertical directions ) and convex binary matrices  @xcite from their discrete x - rays . at the moment , several researchers are studying the following stability question : given a binary matrix having some connectivity and convexity properties and its discrete x - rays along three or four directions , is it possible that small changes in the data lead to `` dramatic '' change in the binary matrix ?    in this paper , we take the second approach into consideration , and we propose some new subclasses consisting of binary matrices with periodicity properties .",
    "the periodicity is a natural constraint and it has not yet been studied in discrete tomography . we provide a polynomial - time algorithm for reconstructing @xmath20-periodical binary matrices from their discrete x - rays in the horizontal and vertical directions ( i.e. , row and column sums ) .",
    "the basic idea of the algorithm is to determine a polynomial transformation of our reconstruction problem to 2-satisfiability problem which can be solved in linear time  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach has been described in  @xcite .",
    "we wish to point out that this paper is only an initial approach to the problem of reconstructing binary matrices having periodicity properties from a small number of discrete x - rays .",
    "there are many open problems on these classes of binary matrices of interest to researchers in discrete tomography and related fields : the problem of uniqueness , the problem of reconstruction from three or more x - rays , the problem of reconstructing binary matrices having convexity and periodicity properties , and so on .",
