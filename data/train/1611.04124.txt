    "while being a phenomenological set - up , the original soft - wall model @xcite can be modified to accommodate the regge type spectrum of radial excitations of selected hadron species at vanishing temperature @xmath5 and chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "extending the model further to @xmath6 one finds that , at temperatures @xmath7 , hadrons as normalisable states disappear @xcite .",

    "the particular choice @xmath89 mev and @xmath90 is for a scenario where , for @xmath68 , the thermal gas solution is valid for all temperatures @xmath91 .",
    "that is , for @xmath91 the vector meson spectrum is as at @xmath64 with the implication that the thermo - statistical model analysis applies in that region with standard vacuum masses of hadrons . at @xmath92 , however , the black hole solution must be accomplished .",
