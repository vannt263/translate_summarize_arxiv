    "a reactor neutrino experiment at an intermediate baseline @xmath260 km with a giant detector  @xcite will have rich physics content .",
    "precise determination of neutrino flux will greatly improve the sensitivity of these experiments . another category of reactor neutrino experiments is @xmath3-electron or @xmath3-nucleus scattering experiments , such as texono  @xcite , munu  @xcite , gemma  @xcite , etc .",
    "normally they wo nt rely on precise neutrino flux .    in this note , we will review the calculation of the reactor neutrino flux and recent progresses on the error analysis .",
    "most commercial reactors are pressurized water reactor ( pwr ) or boiling water reactor ( bwr ) .",
    "they are very similar in neutrino flux calculation .",
    "we will use pwr as examples in the following .",

    "it is normally calibrated to the primary heat balance measurement daily .",
    "this measurement is less accurate , controlled to be less than 1.5% of the full power by daya bay power plant .",
    "recently there are a lot of studies on the power uncertainties and instrumentation improvements by the power plants  @xcite , with the motivation of power uprates .",
    "the power measurements can be more accurate than what were cited in the past reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "the uncertainties of the secondary heat balance is dominated by the flow rate measurement . in the past , there are two kinds of widely used flow meters , venturi type flow meters and orifice plate flow meters .",
    "venturi flow meters are used by most us and japan reactors .",
    "the uncertainty is often 1.4%",
    ". it can be as low as 0.7% if properly calibrated and maintained .",
    "but they suffer from fouling effects , which could grow as high as 3% in a few years .",

    "they have uncertainties 0.45% for type i and 0.2% for type ii  @xcite .",
    "the orifice plate flow meters are used by french reactors .",
    "they have no fouling effects .",
    "typically they have an uncertainty of 0.72% and could be improved to 0.4% with laboratory tests .",

    "chooz estimated this contribution to be @xmath20.3% on the average and ignored it in the detailed analysis due to its small size comparing to other errors .",
    "six chains have been identified in @xcite , with half lives from 10 hours to 28 years .",
    "they only contribute to the low energy region .",

    "a pwr is normally refueled very 12 - 18 months .",
    "the spent fuel from one refueling will contribute @xmath20.2% of the total neutrino rate after first several days .",
    "before the 1980 s , the reactor neutrino flux was determined to an uncertainty of 10% . with a lot of efforts , especially by ill , bugey , chooz , palo verde , etc .",
    ", the uncertainty has improved to ( 2 - 3)% .",

    "we also have a global picture of uncertainties of fission rate simulations .",
    "however , there is no new data on neutrino spectra of fuel isotopes . for single - detector experiments , the neutrino spectrum uncertainty of about 2% will dominate .",
    "the next @xmath0 experiments with near - far relative measurements will suffer little from reactor flux uncertainties , which is estimated to be 0.1% to 0.45% , depending on the experiment layout .",
