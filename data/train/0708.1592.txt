    "the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc will give access to an unprecedented range of processes at @xmath0 scales and event rates far in excess of those generated by earlier colliders .",
    "many rare standard model ( sm ) processes will be studied with high statistics , while at the same time searches will be carried out for particles predicted to exist by theories extending the sm .",
    "the need to stabilise the mechanism for breaking electroweak ( ew ) symmetry in the sm requires that at least some of these new particles have masses of the order of the ew scale ( @xmath1 100 gev ) .",
    "hence , there is every reason to believe that they should be observable at the lhc .    in this paper",
    "we review the results of some of the studies of beyond the standard model physics at the lhc which have been carried out by atlas and cms , concentrating on those involving extra dimensions , compositeness , little higgs , and lef - right symmetric models . for reasons of space",
    ", we do not discuss results of studies of technicolor models , but further details of this and other work can be found in refs .",

    "models incorporating extra space - time dimensions ( ed ) have recently become extremely popular with phenomenologits . an attractive feature of many of these models is that the effective plank scale is brought down to the ew scale by power - law running of the gauge coupling constants , thereby removing the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "a by - product of this running is that we expect quantum gravity effects to begin to mainifest themselves at the tev scale , possibly within the range accessible to the lhc .",
    "striking potential signatures can include graviton resonances contributing to drell - yan processes and new scalar bosons .",
    "the precise characteristics of these signatures depend strongly on the size , shape , and number of extra dimensions .",
    "atlas and cms have investigated three different classes of ed models incorporating large @xcite , warped @xcite or @xmath2 scale @xcite extra dimensions .",
    "large ( @xmath3 extra dimension models such as that proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite , typically assume the existence of @xmath4 eds of size r in which only gravity can propagate . the observed plank scale @xmath5 following compactification",
    "is then related to the fundamental scale of gravity @xmath6 by the relation    @xmath7    if @xmath6 is near the ew scale then the gauge hierarchy problem is neatly solved .",
    "such models predict the existence of an infinite number of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the graviton of very small mass splitting propagating in the @xmath4 dimensional bulk space - time .",
    "this leads to possible discovery signatures based on the searches for kk gravitons + quark ( monojet ) or photon production , in which the graviton is emmitted into the bulk leaving large amount of @xmath8 .",
    "an atlas study of the monojet signature @xcite has shown that after one year of high luminosity running , atlas should be able to confirm add models with @xmath9 , 7.0 or 6.0 tev for 2 , 3 or 4 eds respectively .",
    "an alternative approach searching for associated production of kk gravitons with dileptons and diphotons @xcite has given equivalent reaches of 8.1 , 7.9 and 7.4 tev , indicating that potential signals may be observable in more than one channel .",
    "other ed models construct the universe from the usual four dimensions together with large eds and a number of smaller @xmath2 scale eds @xcite .",
    "the sm fermions propagate only in the usual 4d space - time while the sm gauge bosons propagate additionally in the @xmath2 scale eds and gravitons propagate throughout .",
    "the dynamics associated with the @xmath2 scale eds leads to 4d kk excitations of the sm bosons . with 100@xmath10 , peaks in dileptons invariant mass spectra ( fig .",
    "1 ) arising from excitations of the first kk modes of the photon and @xmath11 can be detected for compactification scale @xmath12 and excesses above sm drell - yan tails for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a third class of ed studies by atlas and cms @xcite @xcite is the warped ed scenario of randall and sundrum @xcite . in these models",
    "the ew scale is generated from the plank scale through warping of one small ed , rather than the presence of large flat eds .",
    "the universe is here envisaged to consist of two 3-branes bounding a warped 5d bulk .",
    "the sm gauge fields propagate on one of the 3-branes while gravitons are localized on the other .",
    "direct searches for new resonances in the dielectrons and diphotons mass spectra have been studied by cms @xcite @xcite , and it has been found that for a randall - sundrum model with coupling parameter c = 0.01 , the graviton excitations have weak coupling to the standard model particles . fig .",
    "2 shows the cms reach in the search for the randall - sundrum graviton decaying into diphoton ( full line ) and electron ( dashed line ) channels as a function of the coupling parameter c and the graviton mass for 10 @xmath10 and 30 @xmath10 .",
    "another important finding by atlas @xcite is that these new states can be determined to be spin-2 rather than spin-1 for masses up to 1.7 tev , allowing @xmath14 interpretations of potential signals to be tested ( fig .",

    "among possible new particles in physics beyond the sm , leptoquarks ( lqs ) are an interesting category of exotic color triplets with coupling to quarks and leptons .",

    "the litte higgs models implement the idea that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite @xcite .",
    "they are constructed by embedding the sm inside a larger group with an enlarged symmetry .",
    "the larger symmetry is then broken at some high scale @xmath40 , so that the higgs mass is protected from radiative corrections at one loop that are dependent quadratically on @xmath41 . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", the effect of this symmetry is to require the existence of new particles whose coupling ensure that the large contributions to the higgs mass are canceled .",
    "there must be three types of new particles ( heavy top , new gauge bosons , and a higgs triplet which contains a doubly charged state ) corresponding to the three contributions to radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "atlas studied @xcite the observability of these particles , and it has been found that the heavy top ( t ) can be observable up to masses of about 2.5 tev via its decay to wb .",
    "sensitivity in zt or ht is lower , but it still extends over the range expected in the model provided that the higgs mass is not too large .",
    "the decay of t to wb and zt ( fig .",
    "6 ) are , of course , independent of the higgs mass . in the case of ht ,",
    "the sensitivity will depend on the higgs mass .    in the case of the new gauge bosons ,",
    "the situation is summarized in fig .",
    "the latter shows the accessible regions via the @xmath42 final states of @xmath43 and @xmath44 as a function of the mixing angles and the scale f that determines the masses . except for a small region near @xmath45 = 1.3 and @xmath46",
    ", we are sensitive to the whole range expected in the model .",
    "however , observation of such a gauge boson will not prove that it is of the type predicted in the little higgs models . in order to do this ,",

    "doubly charged scalar particles arise in many scenarios @xcite extending the weak interaction beyond the standard model . in the left - right symmetric ( lr )",
    "model @xcite such particle is a member of a triplet higgs representation which plays a crucial part in the model .",
    "the gauge symmetry @xmath55 of the lr model is broken to the sm symmetry @xmath56 due to a triplet higgs @xmath57 , whose neutral component acquires a non - vanishing expectation value in the vacuum .",
    "the @xmath57 , called the right - triplet , consists of the complex fields @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "if the langrangian is assumed to be invariant under a discrete @xmath60 symmetry , it must contain , in addition to @xmath57 also , a left - triplet @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the lr model predicts two kinds of doubly charged particles with different interactions .",
    "in contrast with @xmath57 , the existence of @xmath62 is not essential from the point of view of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry .",
    "the vacuum expectation value @xmath63 of its neutral member is actually quite tightly bound by the @xmath64 parameter , i.e. by the measured mass ratio of the ordinary weak bosons .    the main experimental signature of a produced @xmath65 would be a hard same - sign lepton pair .",
    "there will be no substantial background due to the standard model , since in the sm a same - sign lepton pair will always be associated with missing energy , i.e. neutrinos , due to lepton number conservation .",
