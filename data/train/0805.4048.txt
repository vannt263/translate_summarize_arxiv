    "molecular gas is the driving element of star formation in galaxies , and its quantitative relation to the current star formation rate is essential to our understanding of galactic evolution .",
    "it has become increasingly clear that the dynamical properties of galaxies are responsible for redistributing molecular gas on large scales , and hence the star formation which follows is also affected by the dynamical properties .",
    "these dynamical properties are expressed as large scale features ( morphology ) of the galaxies , i.e. , the presence bars and difference between hubble type .",
    "these two features ( presence of bars and hubble type ) are most prominent and characteristic in the central kiloparsecs of galaxies , which is also where most of the molecular gas in galaxies is present .",
    "therefore , the distribution of gas within the central region of various morphologies and its relation with star formation has gained attention in recent years .",
    "bars on kpc scales at the centers of galaxies are known to redistribute angular momentum and transfer molecular gas to the centers .",
    "@xcite showed that molecular gas in barred galaxies has a higher degree of concentration in its central 1 kpc compared to gas inside the optical disk , by using interferometric data from the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) and owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) at @xmath2 resolution .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed by using the berkeley - illinois - maryland - array ( bima ) at @xmath3 resolution that the central 1 kpc of barred galaxies has four times more molecular gas compared to the global average .",
    "some barred galaxies in their sample were not detected , and they attribute it to the quenching of gas due to efficient star formation in barred galaxies .",
    "single dish observations have also proved effective . by using the nobeyama radio observatory@xmath4 ( nro ) 45 m telescope , @xcite mapped out 40 nearby galaxies at @xmath5 resolution .",
    "they defined the `` inner '' central concentration @xmath6 as the ratio between molecular mass in @xmath7 of the k band radius ( defined at 20 @xmath8 in the @xmath9 band ) and that within @xmath10 of the k band radius .",
    "they similarly defined the `` outer '' central concentration @xmath11 as the ratio between molecular mass in @xmath10 of the k band radius and that within the whole of the k band radius .",
    "they found that barred galaxies have a significantly higher @xmath6 , whereas the @xmath11 did not show much dependence .",
    "furthermore , they found a correlation between @xmath6 and the bar strength .",
    "it seems that molecular gas concentration due to bars is a well established phenomenon , and this has also been explored in terms of numerical simulations(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "molecular gas is also known to be distributed differently between early and late type galaxies .",
    "molecular gas mass in the centers of galaxies have been found to decrease in later hubble types ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this has been attributed to the existence of a stellar bulge in early type galaxies ( @xcite ) creating a deep potential well in which gas is accumulated . even in the absence of stellar bulges ,",
    "possible correlations with nuclear star clusters and stellar surface brightness have been found ( @xcite ) .",
    "sheth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) report a four - fold central molecular mass increase in barred early type galaxies compared to barred late type galaxies .",
    "early type galaxies , however , have been found to host stronger bars than late types , with larger @xmath12 and @xmath13 fourier amplitudes ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "this points to the possibility that early type galaxies may show larger central concentration simply because they host stronger bars .",
    "it is important , therefore , to quantify which factor ( the presence of bars or hubble type ) plays the larger role in ridistributing gas to the central regions of galaxies .",
    "mapping observations in co are optimum for the study of molecular gas distribution in nearby galaxies , but available galaxy samples are limited by the vast observing time needed for such projects ( e.g. , sakamoto et al .",
    "1999 ; helfer et al . 2001 ; sofue et al .",
    "2003 ) . in turn , single beam measurements at the centers of a large sample of galaxies lack the precision in terms of spatial distribution of molecular gas , but can compensate for the lack of number of sample galaxies . in this respect , quantifying the co content of nearby galactic centers for a large sample using single dish telescopes , is still rewarding .    in order to complement existing studies on molecular gas concentration in galaxies of various morphology , we have conducted a large survey of the central region of nearby galaxies using nro 45 m telescope .",
    "our data provides a unique opportunity to study the gas distribution in the central region , with several advantages : 1 ) samples are distributed mostly at the distance of 16mpc , and therefore the single beam subtends a similar scale of the central 1 kpc of galaxies .",
    "2 ) many of our samples are also observed by young et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using the fcrao 14 m dish , with an angular resolution of 45@xmath1 or a linear scale of 3 kpc .",
    "therefore , the ratio of co intensity measured by the different surveys can be interpreted as a degree of central concentration of molecular gas .",
    "the sample galaxies have been selected from those observed and detected in the fcrao catalog ( @xcite and @xcite ) of nearby galaxies .",
    "the fcrao survey is the largest co survey of nearby galaxies ( 300 galaxies ) , spanning a wide range of parameter space for spirals , but with a large beamsize of 45@xmath1 .",
    "all of our observing samples , mainly spirals , come from galaxies observed in this survey .",
    "since one of the secondary aims of our survey is compare the co data with star formation ( to be presented in forthcoming papers ) , galaxies in the fcrao survey were selected on whether they had available @xmath14 data as listed in @xcite , and also with measured @xmath15 ratio ( to be used to correct for internal dust extinction ) in @xcite .",
    "ninety - one galaxies meet this criteria , of which 14 were already observed at either the nro 45 m or the iram 30 m telescope which has a similar beamsize as the nro 45 m telescope . therefore , the final selected sample consisted of 77 galaxies .",
    "galaxies in the fcrao survey were selected to span a wide variety of galaxies , and were not magnitude or volume limited .",
    "our sample also follows this idea .    in the observation ( see following section ) , 38 of the 77 were actually observed , due mainly to weather conditions . an additional five , with @xmath14 data from @xcite but without @xmath15 , and 25 with observations from the fcrao survey but not @xmath14 , were observed .",
    "these galaxies without @xmath14 measurements were simply selected by whether they were observable at that certain perioud .",
    "thus , our observed sample consists of 68 galaxies .",
    "table [ 45msample ] lists the observed samples .",

    "this can not be explained by the classical picture of bars simply helping the inflow of molecular gas towards the center , because then we should expect barred galaxies to have a peak at a higher degree of central concentration .",

    "bars are also known to centrally concentrate gas , although not found to be statistically significant based on our current data ( see the discussion section for possible reasons ) .",
    "the main setbacks of previous studies is that they have not been able to solve the degeneracy between the effect of hubble type and bars because of small sample size .",

    "infact , figure 11 ( top ) seems to suggest that barred early type galaxies have a top - heavy molecular mass distribution compared to non - barred early types with a slightly higher mean co intensity .",

    "this is not siginificant either , and it is clear from figure 12 ( middle ) that the apparent difference in the two distribution , results from a wider distribution of co intensity in barred late type galaxies .",
    "four barred late type galaxies have high molecular gas mass ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "all of these are known starburst galaxies ( ngc  253 , ic  342 , ngc  3079 and ngc6946 ) . except for these four , barred galaxies in late types do not show a high gas density distribution ; barred galaxies in late types apparently do not have the high gas density expected from gas angular momentum redistribution . in cases where the gas is concentrated ,",
    "they have extremely concentrated gas and an associated starburst .",
    "this leads us to speculate that these high central concentration late type starbursts , may either be on the verge of evolving to early type galaxies if the starburst is strong enough ( in the context of secular evolution ) , or just using up the molecular fuel to move its place in figure 12 ( middle ) to the most less massive barred late types , which also shows a distinctive tail from non - barred late types .",
    "if the presence of a bulge and its stellar potential drives molecular gas into the central region regardless of whether they have bars , we can expect early type non - barred galaxies to have higher @xmath45 than late type non - barred galaxies .",
    "infact , these two are likely to be significantly different , with @xmath66 . the average co intensity in early non - barred galaxies ( @xmath67 ) is more than two times larger than late non - barred galaxies ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the bulge potential seems very effective in concentrating molecular gas into the central 1 kpc .",
    "barred early type galaxies also siginificantly differ from barred late types , with @xmath69 . in the same way , with the barred and non - barred galaxies combined , early type galaxies and late type galaxies are , again , significantly different ( @xmath70 ) . from these analysis",
    ", it seems that the bulge potential ( hubble type ) is the more effective parameter in changing @xmath34 in the central 1 kpc , than bars .",
    "the possibility of early type galaxies showing more massive molecular gas in the central 1 kpc only because of stronger bars than late types , is rejected .",
    "it is also important , however , to normalize the co intensity in the central 1 kpc with co data in a larger area to more accurately address the central concentration of molecular gas .",

    "the bottom figure is the same as the top and middle , but with barred and non - barred galaxies combined .",
    "the high central concentration tail ( see section 8) in the distribution can be seen for early type galaxies , but not in late types ( meaning , that early type galaxies constitute the high concentration tail in figure [ bars_iratio_all ] ) .",
    "the ks test shows that the probability of barred galaxies and non - barred galaxies for the early type group derived from the same parent group is @xmath71 . molecular gas in barred early galaxies are not significantly more centrally concentrated than non - barred early types , but the tail of higher concentration in barred galaxies can still be seen , the median concentration being 1.6 times higher in barred early types .    the central concentration in late type galaxies in figure 12 ( middle ) seem much more insensitive to the presence of bars .",
    "the tail of higher concentration that was seen in early types are not seen .",
    "the only exception of a highly centrally concentrated barred late type galaxy is ngc  3486 , with practically all of the gas within its central 1 kpc .",

    "late type galaxies , on the other hand , actually peak at less than 1 , meaning that many late type galaxies are less dense in the central kpc compared to its surrounding disk .",
    "early type galaxies are more likely to be centrally concentrated than late types ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "central concentration of molecular gas from bars in early type ( sbc and earlier ) galaxies had already been found by sheth et al .",

    "the median central concentration for our sample of early type bars ( @xmath774.1 ) is also higher than early type non - bars ( @xmath772.6 ) , although not by a factor of 2 .",
    "our definition of central concentration @xmath75 employs the molecular mass in the central 45@xmath1 for normalization whereas the @xcite sample uses the global molecular mass . since the central 45@xmath1 ( @xmath78 kpc ) would likely not contain all of the galaxy s molecular gas , any trends in the central concentration would be mitigated compared with normalizations using the whole molecular content .",
    "kuno et al . ( 2007 ) , similarly , used co maps to define the central concentration of molecular gas in a sample of 40 galaxies .",
    "they found barred galaxies are significantly ( @xmath79 ) more centrally concentrated than non - barred galaxies .",
    "therefore , our result that barred galaxies are not significantly more concentrated ( @xmath55 ) , is likely to be a result of using the central 45@xmath1 for normalization rather than the central concentration being not as strong .",
    "errors in the measurements , which can change the derived co intensity by factor two when comparing different telescopes , can also reduce the power of comparison with the fcrao measurements .",
