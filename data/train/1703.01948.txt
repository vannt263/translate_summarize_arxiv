    "the achievement of localized , stationary and stable propagation of multidimensional waves in homogeneous , isotropic nonlinear media is one of the main problems in nonlinear optics , and constitutes today a broad area of research @xcite .",
    "many of the elaborated solutions , some of them realized experimentally , rely on two broad models .",
    "the first one is the conservative model based on nonlinear schrdinger equations with dispersive , kerr - type nonlinearities and others , describing passive propagation of intense waves in unbounded transparent media .",
    "the second model is the complex ginzburg - landau equation in systems with gain and loss , as laser cavities @xcite .",
    "more or less broad families of solitons and dissipative solitons ( also called auto - solitons or cavity - solitons ) with a variety of geometries have been reported to be supported by these models . given their relation with the present article , we mention the families of vortex - solitons solitons with a nested vortex @xcite , their azimuthally modulated versions called azimuthons @xcite and solitons clusters @xcite , see @xcite for a review . in the conservative models , a stable balance between diffraction and the dispersive nonlinearities supports the robust stationary propagation . in the dissipative model",
    ", an additional balance is needed between gain and losses @xcite .",
    "non - conservative models involving only losses are usually left aside because they do not support solitons , in the sense of self - trapped structures .",
    "however the nonlinear schrdinger equation with purely loss terms and no gain terms arises naturally in situations as common as light beam propagation in transparent dielectrics media at intensities such that multi - photon absorption processes are relevant .",
    "the existence of light beams , called nonlinear unbalanced bessel beams , with the ability to propagate without any change , including no attenuation , in media with kerr - type nonlinearities and nonlinear absorption , was described in 2004 @xcite .",
    "they provided a theoretical basis for interpreting some features of light filaments generated from intense , ultrashort pulses @xcite , where nonlinear absorption arises from multi - photon ionization , particularly the replenishment and self - healing mechanisms involved in their robust and quasi - stationary propagation @xcite .",
    "stationarity with nonlinear absorption is indeed possible for less strongly localized waves than solitons , as nonlinear versions of bessel - like and airy - like beams @xcite carrying , ideally , an infinite amount of power , or a power reservoir . in these beams",
    "@xcite the power in the reservoir is permanently flowing towards the central region of high intensity , where most of nonlinear power losses take place , replenishing it . after the fundamental nonlinear unbalanced bessel beam @xcite ,",
    "the same mechanism has been more recently seen to work with high - order ( vortex - carrying ) nonlinear bessel beams @xcite . here",
    "we will refer to all them as nonlinear bessel vortex beams ( nonlinear bvbs ) , the fundamental beam being the particular vortex - less situation .",
    "nonlinear bvbs have proven to be particularly fruitful to explain the filamentation dynamics seeded by ultrashort ( linear ) bessel beams @xcite .",
    "even if the physics of filamentation involves complex light - matter interactions and rich spatiotemporal dynamics @xcite , the three key phenomena determining substantially the filamentation dynamics with conical beams are just those supporting the stationarity of nonlinear bvbs , namely , diffraction , kerr self - focusing and the nonlinear absorption @xcite .",
    "the steady and unsteady regimes of filamentation observed in the filamentation with the lowest - order bessel beam @xcite have been successfully explained in terms of nonlinear bvb attractors and their stability properties @xcite .",
    "more recently , tubular filamentation from vortex - carrying bessel beams has been created @xcite , and has also been interpreted as the formation of a vortex - carrying nonlinear bvb that is stable against radial and azimuthal perturbations @xcite .",
    "the disintegration of the tubular regime into rotatory or random filaments observed in related experiments is also explained in terms of the development of the azimuthal instability of unstable nonlinear bvbs @xcite .",
    "the intensity profiles of nonlinear bvbs are all circularly symmetric , and so they are the dissipation channels that they can generate .",
    "the tubular regime is a sophisticated example of a  tailored \" or controlled transversal pattern , which is expected to open new perspectives in laser - powered material processing and other applications @xcite .",
    "complex filamentation patterns other than circular arise naturally in multiple filamentation from small - scale self - focusing of laser beams carrying many critical powers @xcite , or from the azimuthal instability of tubular filaments @xcite , but originating from noisy perturbations , these patterns are largely uncontrollable and far from being propagation - invariant .",
    "in this paper we investigate if propagation - invariant light beams with other geometries , preferably with controllable intensity and dissipation patterns , are supported by transparent dielectrics with self - focusing nonlinearities and nonlinear absorption .",
    "we find the affirmative answer when studying by means of the numerical simulations the nonlinear propagation dynamics seeded by illuminating the medium with coherent superpositions of bessel beams of different topological charges and amplitudes .",
    "these ( linear ) bessel beam superpositions are easily generated using spatial light modulators @xcite , illuminating an axicon with several coherent gaussian beams with embedded vorticities , or with superpositions of laguerre - gauss beams @xcite .",
    "for a range of the parameters that define the input bessel beam superposition and the material medium , stationary and stable propagation states dissipating constantly their power along organized and narrow channels are seen to emerge spontaneously .",
    "we confine ourselves to the superposition of two bessel beams , where the channels geometry is primarily controlled by their amplitudes and topological charges , and the variety of intensity and dissipation patterns is already very vast .    to clearly distinguish these states from other",
    "known localized structures , we first present the more general states without any particular symmetry , and then we focus on those with @xmath0-fold rotational symmetry formed from superpositions of two bessel beams of opposite topological charges , resembling azimuthons @xcite",
    ". these structures are nevertheless neither conservative nor supported by a gain - loss balance , and do not rotate either . given the distinctive properties of having arbitrary shapes , and of not being supported by gain , i. e. , of being strictly dissipative , we have called them  dissipatons \" .",
    "outside their central region , dissipatons are always seen to have linear conical tails , and therefore a power reservoir , shaped like a superposition of unbalanced bessel beams ( i. e. , with unequal inward and outward hnkel beam amplitudes ) , all them with the same cone angle but different topological charges .",
    "the excess of the inward hnkel beam amplitudes creates an inward radial current , as that in nonlinear bvbs but with an azimuthal dependence , and such that net power flux coming from the reservoir equals the total power loss rate in the dissipative core .",
    "we find simple rules that describe the dissipaton formation .",
    "given an input superposition of bessel beams , the dissipaton that emerges preserves the cone angle , the topological charges and the amplitudes of the inward hnkel components of all input bessel beams .",
    "although the dissipative center has a more complex structure of intertwined hot spots and vortices , it reflects up to certain extent the structure of the linear tails , and therefore that of the input bessel beam superposition , the dissipation pattern being then quite controllable .",
    "numerical simulations also show that dissipatons are stable under large perturbations strongly distorting the dissipative center .",
    "in fact , the only condition for the whole dissipaton structure to emerge spontaneously is the presence of the inward currents carried by its inward hnkel beam components .",
    "according to the above , we consider the propagation of a paraxial light beam @xmath1\\right\\ } $ ] , with carrier frequency @xmath2 , propagation constant @xmath3 ( @xmath0 is the linear refractive index and @xmath4 the speed of light in vacuum ) and with complex envelope @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that cubic kerr nonlinearity and nonlinear absorption are the dominating nonlinearities of the medium . as with nonlinear bvbs , other dispersive nonlinearities ( quintic , saturable )",
    "could be considered as well without substantial changes in the results .",
    "the evolution of the envelope is then ruled by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transverse laplacian given by @xmath8 in cylindrical coordinates @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the nonlinear refractive index , and @xmath11 is the @xmath12-photon - absorption coefficient .    at low enough intensities ( neglecting the nonlinear terms ) , eq .",

    "we find it convenient to use the scaled and dimensionless radial coordinate , propagation distance and envelope @xmath17 [ in many figures below , we will also use the dimensionless cartesian coordinates @xmath18 , to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) as @xmath19 where now @xmath20 , and @xmath21 with these variables , the linear bessel beams reads as @xmath22 .",

    "we will further write the complex envelope as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are its real amplitude and phase . the nlse ( [ nlse2 ] ) is then seen to be equivalent to the energy transport and eikonal equations @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are unit radial and azimuthal vectors , and @xmath57 is the current of the intensity @xmath58 in the transversal plane .",
