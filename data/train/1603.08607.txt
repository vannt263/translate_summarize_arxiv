    "recent advance of optical technology has enabled us to generate photon - number fixed states ( fock state of photons ) and to observe unusual interferometric phenomena such as hong - ou - mandel dip and fractional - period interference pattern @xcite .",
    "typical description of those phenomena is based on monochromatic wave vectors which are stationary in time and extends to infinite space .",
    "the advantage of this description is that the function of a delay line is described by the phase shift of individual monochromatic waves .",
    "however , a photon can be expressed based on any orthonormal set of wave vectors which are contained in the structure of the relevant electro - magnetic wave field .",
    "actual experiments use pulsed photons which occupy a finite space and change their wave form in time . in this article",
    "we try to describe the physics of an idealized two - path interferometer which is fed with one or two photons using the basis most convenient for describing experimental results .    in the next section we use the wave function of one of two incoming photons as a basis vector of the orthnormal set describing the single photon space .. this description is convenient when we need at most two orthogonal vectors to describe the state of photons , and provides clear view of what is expected to observe .    in the third section we return to the traditional way of description , and discuss on phenomena when spectral characteristics of the photons are important .",
    "a photon is a vector of norm ( length ) one in a hilbert space , and can be expressed by a complex function @xmath0 in a three dimensional space , which satisfies @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the three dimensional coordinates , and @xmath3 is additional discrete variables to define the function @xmath4 .",
    "the inner product of the vector is defined by @xmath5 any vector @xmath6 in the set is expressed as a sum of orthonormal vectors @xmath7 with a unitary matrix @xmath8 , @xmath9    @xmath10 develops in time satisfying maxwell equations ( in vaccum ) , , and may change its shape @xmath11 with time @xmath12 .",
    "however , the inner product is preserved , ( therefore , together with the norm ) at any time , @xmath13 therefore , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are the set of orthonormal photons at any time . since @xmath11 is a solution of maxwell equation , the dynamics of single photon is the same as that of the classical electro - magnetic wave .",
    "the difference between quantum and classical phenomena occurs when two or more photons are involved .",
    "a two - photon state is not a vector of norm @xmath16 in the one - photon hilbert space , but is a vector of norm one in the product space of the two one - photon hilbert space .",
    "in addition a vector in the two - photon space are restricted to those which is symmetric with the exchange of photons in the two one - photon spaces , @xmath17 for any @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the normalization factor .",
    "the dynemics of a multi - photon interferometer is more conveniently written by using photon - creation and annihilation operators .",
    "for elements of a set of orthonormal vectors a creation operator @xmath21 and an annihilation operator @xmath22 satisfy commutation relations @xmath23 and @xmath24 for all other combinations .",

    "any two - photon vector @xmath29 is expressed by a set of orthonormal vectors as @xmath30 where \\{@xmath31 } is an unitary matrix .",
    "similarly we can expresse an n - photon vector @xmath32 by a sum of orthonormal vectors in the @xmath33-photon space . @xmath34 with all combinations @xmath35 satisfying @xmath36 .      in an interferometer ,",
    "mirrors , beam splitters , delay lines , phase plate , polarization plates and optical fibers change and restrict the propagation of photons .",
    "we consider an idealized two - path interferometer in which a photon is a scalar wave traveling one dimensionally along two channels .",
    "the beam splitters mix waves of two channels .",
    "all optical elements interact with a single photon instantaneously and locally .",
    "furthermore , we restrict that all optical components including the transmission lines are dispersion free . in real world",
    "the above conditions are satisfied only by a limited range of vectors of the system .",
    "if the photon propagate in free space , it expands gradually its cross - sectional size .",
    "wavelength dispersion of a beam splitter is not avoidable when the spectral range of the photon is very large .",
    "however , we know that the above restrictions are satisfied in many interferometric experiments , or at least we try to satisfy them in operation .",
    "we restrict the wave of a photon to , @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is a slowly varying scalar envelope function .",
    "figure  [ machzhender ] shows the system we discuss .",
    "photons enter through the position z or sometimes through a. amplitudes of the upper ( u ) and the lower ( l ) channels mixes at two beam splitters .",
    "the state of the lower channel is modified by one or two delay lines .",
    "the state of the photons is detected by detectors which are sensitive to photons in either one of the two channels .",

    "the task is to express the state of photons at the input position z or a by orthonormal vectors which have amplitude only on the channel u or l at the position of detectors , d or b ..     and bs@xmath42 .",

    "a typical photo - electric detector consists of many photo - sensitive elements much smaller than the transverse dimension of the optical wave .",
    "intrinsic time resolution of the detector may not match to the duration time of the photon .",
    "in this article otherwise stated we assume that the detector responds instantaneously . since we deal the photon which does not have transverse structure",
    ", the instantaneous detector can detect all characteristics of arriving photons at the detector position .",
    "frequently the characteristics of the detector is modified by auxiliary components .",
    "they may produce phenomena which have little relation with the dynamics of the investigating interferometer .",
    "a typical example is a narrow - band filter . what the narrow - band detector does is that it divides an optical pulse into many paths , give different traveling length for each path , and then sum divided pulse components together .",
    "it is a multi - path interferometer and produces interference which does not exist in the investigating interferometer .",
    "we describe the creation ( or annihilation ) operator of a photon whose amplitude is non - zero in a specific channel by @xmath45 .",
    "the first letter @xmath27 of the suffix shows the wave form of the photon @xmath46 which is the function of the relative position of the wave along the channel @xmath38 . the second letter is to show the channel this photon exists .",

    "the third letter w specifies the position in the interferometer .",
    "it runs z ( input to the system ) , a ( input of the first beam splitter ) , b ( exit of the first beam splitter ) , c ( input of the second beam splitter ) , and d ( the exit of the second beam splitter ) .    to avoid confusion we use the word  mode  to specify the shape of the wave function of the photon which enters the interferometer .",
    "single mode does not mean that all photons propagating in the interferometer are an identical vector of the hilbert space of the interferometer .",
    "the vector is uniquely specified only by the full specification of the creation ( or annihilation ) operator @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 ) .",
