    "in non interacting electronic systems , one considers energy levels with spin degeneracy and fills them with two electrons par level , without any consideration of u , the local coulomb repulsion on atomic orbitals .",
    "but as soon as one considers a solid which displays magnetic properties the latter has to be considered , as u is responsible for atomic and solid state magnetism .",
    "an introduction to these aspects has been given in a previous scholarpedia article on the electronic properties of _ strongly correlated electron systems _ , which will be quoted as * sces * throughout this article .",
    "if one starts with a completely free electron gas , the first incidence of weak correlations can be expressed in a fermi liquid approach , that is the electronic states at the fermi level are not single particle states but rather quasiparticle states in which the electron is dressed by an electronic cloud which involves the electronic correlations .",
    "those quasiparticles are populated in a same way as free electron cases , except that the population jump at the fermi level is smaller than unity .",
    "correspondingly these quasiparticles have effective masses @xmath0 which differ from the electron mass .",
    "this is seen for instance in the specific heat and the pauli susceptibility .    with increasing electron correlations one reaches situations where electron states are in an intermediate regime between independent extended electronic states and local states .",
    "those intermediate electronic states are at the basis of the correlated electron physics which gives exotic properties to the materials and various competing low @xmath1 states which are far from being understood at this time .    here",
    "we shall take advantage of a series of nmr experimental investigations done on correlated electron systems , to introduce various specific effects which have been highlighted in such systems .",
    "the principal useful nmr parameters and technical details have been introduced in a previous scholarpedia article _ nmr studies of electronic properties of solids _ that we shall quote as * nmreps * from now on .",
    "the good knowledge of the nmr characteristics in solids for which non interacting electron theories apply quite well , naturally permitted in the initial experiments to detect the unexpected modifications of electronic properties which occur in the presence of strong electronic correlations .",
    "this appears as an advantage of the nmr technique , with respect to most recent experimental probes which have been developed specifically to study strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "this article will be organised as follows .",
    "we shall recall first in * section  [ magnetic imputrities & kundo effect ] * the relatively simple case of the nmr studies on the magnetic properties of _",
    "3d _ impurities in metallic _ sp _ systems , which has been highlighted as the kondo effect . this has been the earliest correlated electron physics case which has been understood .",
    "it has opened the way to the study of heavy fermions and kondo lattices which will be touched in * section  [ heavy fermions and kondo lattices]*.",
    "the high @xmath2 cuprates is of course the family of compounds which has attracted a large interest on correlated electron physics especially in the low doping part of the phase diagram where nmr experiments have permitted to reveal the occurrence of a pseudogap as is detailed in * section  [ cuprate pseudogap]*. the original properties induced by electron interactions in 1d systems , that is luttinger liquids will be briefly mentioned then in * section  [ 1d metals]*. we detail in * section  [ impurities and local responses in correlated electron systems ] * the original behavior of impurities in correlated electron systems , spin chains , cuprates , which have been important to reveal some of the physical properties which were difficult to probe by distinct approaches .",
    "this altogether has induced large efforts to clarify the incidence of disorder on the properties of correlated electron systems .",
    "the study of exotic superconductivities and the capability of nmr to give some hints on the sc order parameter symmetry is illustrated in * section  [ exotic superconductivities]*. an important tendency towards charge ordering situations has been proposed to dominate the electronic properties of correlated electron systems",
    ". we shall illustrate in * section  [ charge differentiation and orbital order ] * , in the particular case of na cobaltates , that nmr ideally permits to unravel such situations in great detail .",
    "of course purely magnetic insulating states are essential cases of correlated electron physics .",
    "those imply a large variety of magnetic states , from ordered spin lattices to disordered spin glasses and spin liquid states which are highlighted when frustration effects occur in an ordered lattice .",
    "some of the specific information which can be brought by nmr experiments on such magnetic states are discussed in * section  [ insulating magnetic states and spin liquids]*. finally we illustrate in * section  [ metallic magnetic states and mott insulator to metal transition ] * how nmr techniques permitted to study recently the insulator to metal transition induced by pressure in undoped half filled systems , that is the actual mott transition .",
    "this has been made possible by the recent discovery of quasi 2d organic and 3d alkali fulleride compounds , which display quasi ideal 2d or 3d mott transitions .",
    "let us point out that throughout this article we restrict ourselves to a presentation of some robust experimental evidences on these correlated electron systems .",
    "we avoid as much as possible entering into the theoretical debates which are natural in a vivid research area and are not solved so far .",
    "one of the first correlated electron physics problem which has been fully solved has been revealed by studies of @xmath3 impurities substituted on the atomic sites of regular @xmath4 metals .",
    "one usually assumed that a local moment @xmath5 resides on the @xmath3 sites and interacts with the free electron spin @xmath6 by an exchange interaction @xmath7 the kondo problem arose with the discovery by j.kondo that perturbation theory of this hamiltonian resulted in a @xmath8 term in the resistivity of the alloys , which was indeed observed experimentally .",
    "it was understood that the conduction electron interaction with the local moment induced a crossover of the impurity electronic state towards a low @xmath1 ground state quite different from the quasi - free local moment and that the crossover temperature defines an energy scale    @xmath9\\ ] ]    this expression for the kondo temperature @xmath10 bears some analogy with that of @xmath11 and the energy gap variation with electron - phonon coupling for superconductivity .",
    "it has been harder to qualify the actual properties of the kondo ground state , but from the observed transport and thermodynamic properties associated with the impurity degrees of freedom , it has been accepted rather soon that the impurity properties experimentally appear to evolve from a high @xmath1 magnetic state to a non - magnetic like behavior below @xmath10 . in other words ,",
    "the weak coupling regime where the impurity moment can be treated in a perturbation scheme evolves at low @xmath1 in a strong coupling regime where the impurity and conduction electrons are bound into the ground state .",
    "the basic picture which was initially accepted is that the conduction electrons might form a singlet state with the impurity and compensate its magnetization .",
    "if such a spatially extended state occurs , one would then expect to see its experimental signature on local magnetic measurements in the corresponding spatial range around the impurity , so that nmr experiments appeared as the ideal probe to view such effects.from the study of the macroscopic properties of impurities in noble metal hosts , it was established that the crossover temperature @xmath10 was highly dependent on the impurity .",
    "this was of course quite compatible with the exponential expression of eq.2 .",
    "values of @xmath10 could be estimated from the maximum in the impurity contribution to the specific heat , or from the weiss contribution to the spin susceptibility measured at high enough temperature , etc .",
    "this permitted to establish that @xmath10 was below 10 mk for cu - mn , @xmath12 k for cu - cr , @xmath13 k for cu - fe , @xmath14 k for au - v , etc .",
    "( daybell and steyert 1968).it was harder to consider al - mn along the same lines as all temperature variations were very weak in this case , so that this crossover could only occur above 1000 k , for which the alloy would have molten .",
    "anyway , if one wanted to study experimentally the change from the magnetic state to the non magnetic state , one needed to consider in priority a system in which one can explore both regimes @xmath15 and @xmath16 . therefore cu - fe appeared immediately as the most suitable case if one wanted to avoid extremely low temperature experiments , while cu - mn and al - mn appeared as the two extreme opposite cases .",
    "this idea of a kondo singlet has led to some attempts to detect modifications of the host @xmath17cu nmr width when @xmath1 is decreased through @xmath10.those early experiments were initially taken as a signature of the development of a static polarized cloud anti - parallel to the local impurity magnetization .",
    "but the situation was only fully clarified when nmr resonances of @xmath17cu near neighbors to the fe were detected ( see * nmreps * ) .",
    "the shifts of the various lines had @xmath1 variations which scaled with each - other and displayed the same curie - weiss dependence as the magnetic susceptibility data taken in very dilute samples , as displayed in * fig .",
    "[ fig1](a)*. so , on a small number of sites near the impurity , the magnetic behaviour does display a smooth @xmath1 variation through @xmath10 , which allowed one to deny the existence of a static compensating cloud.this result confirmed that the susceptibility reaches a low @xmath1 behavior similar to that achieved in a non - magnetic case , as has been also found by the numerical solutions of the kondo model established by wilson ( nobel prize ) ( wilson 1975 ) . however , these results do not give any answer about the spatial extension of the correlated kondo state ( this matter is discussed in alloul , 2012 ) .",
    "induced by fe impurities in cu for three satellite resonances , and of the impurity susceptibility obtained by mssbauer effect data ( @xmath18 ) scale perfectly with each - other .",
    "this gives a good experimental determination of the variation of the local spin susceptibility through @xmath19k , which crosses over from a high @xmath1 curie - weiss dependence above @xmath20toward a quadratic @xmath21 variation below @xmath10 ( see inset ) ( from alloul , 1975 ) . *",
    "( b ) * experimental variation of @xmath22 deduced from the @xmath23 data for various near - neighbour sites of fe in copper .",
    "three data points obtained from neutron scattering experiments are plotted with empty symbols .",

    "* ( c ) * the computed spectral functions ( from janis and augustinsky 2008 ) are plotted for different temperatures @xmath1 . the spectral function for @xmath16 give evidence for the two hubbard bands and the kondo resonance at the fermi energy .",
    "the latter disappears at high temperature . in this figure",
    "all energies are normalized to the hybridization energy of the anderson impurity model.,width=377,height=302 ]    a large effort has been done initially using esr spectroscopy to try to understand the dynamic properties of local moment impurities in metals .",
    "it is well known ( * nmreps * ) that nuclear spins @xmath24 , which couple to the band @xmath6 electron spins in a metal by a scalar contact hyperfine coupling display a @xmath1 linear spin lattice relaxation rate @xmath25 .",
    "the local moment @xmath5 being coupled to the band electron spins @xmath6 by the analogouscontact hamiltonian of eq.(1 ) one then expects to obtain a similar korringa local moment relaxation rate @xmath26 some technical complications limit the use of electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) .",
    "this has stimulated the use of nuclear spins as probes of the dynamics of the local moment .",
    "indeed the occurrence of the spin density oscillations around the impurities , recalled in * nmreps * resumes in an indirect coupling between the nuclear spin @xmath27at site @xmath28 and the local moment at the origin , given by @xmath29 it can be easily seen that the fluctuations of the local moment induce local field fluctuations on @xmath30 that are responsible for its nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate .",
    "the latter can be written as    @xmath31    assuming a standard lorentzian shape for the local moment dynamic susceptibility .",
    "quantitative analyses could be obtained by @xmath32 measurements taken on the nmr signals of the individual near - neighbor shells of the impurity . combining the @xmath32 data with the measure of @xmath33 , the contribution of the local moment to the shift of given satellites permits to eliminate @xmath34 the obtained values of @xmath35",
    "were indeed found independent of the observed satellite , and were furthermore @xmath1 independent below @xmath10 in cu - fe , as can be seen in * fig .",
    "[ fig1](b)*. in the low @xmath1 limit , the data resumes into a korringa relation @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the electron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios .",
    "these experiments therefore established that @xmath22 reaches a constant value in the kondo state , as does the local moment susceptibility .",
    "this also means that the kondo energy scale @xmath39 which limits the increase of @xmath40 below @xmath10 , governs as well the @xmath1 independent spin lattice rate @xmath22 for the local moment , with both @xmath41 and@xmath42 ( alloul , 1977 ) .",
    "such a result then fits with the idea that the kondo state has a dynamic behavior controlled by @xmath39 .",
    "let us point out that calculations done along the renormalization group analysis or the bethe ansatz showed that the kondo state displays a resonance at the fermi energy ( see * fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) * ) , which has a very narrow width controlled by@xmath43 , and that the local moment spin lifetime appears as a direct determination of the width of this kondo resonance peak .",
    "similar measurements of @xmath44 in cu - mn could be combined with the data taken in cu - fe to give the overall variation of @xmath44 over a few decades in @xmath45 extending below and above @xmath10 ( alloul _ et al _ , 1979).this permits to underline a transition from local moment physics at high @xmath1 to a fermi liquid type of behaviour which can be considered as a local fermi liquid .",
    "+ * in this section we have shown that a magnetic impurity substituted in a host metal induces a spin polarisation in its surroundings which can be probed by the nmr shift of the neighbouring host nuclei .",
    "this permits directly to monitor the @xmath1 variation of the impurity moment susceptibility and spin dynamics , the latter through @xmath32 measurements .",

    "( b ) * nmr shift anomaly in cecoin@xmath50 which permits to locate @xmath49 at about 50k in this compound .",
    "this can be seen from the non linear scaling of the in ( red squares ) and co ( blue circles ) nmr shifts with the susceptibility ( from curro 2009).,width=377,height=302 ]    the kondo effect discussed in * section  [ magnetic imputrities & kundo effect ] * applies as well for dilute rare earth ( @xmath51 ) or actinides ( @xmath52 ) impurities in metals .",
    "this has been found most often for ce , yb or u impurities for which the kondo state resumes also into a narrow resonance at the fermi level of the host material .",
    "the significant difference with @xmath3 transition elements is that a quite large concentration of magnetic sites can be usually introduced in those intermetallic compounds .",
    "for instance , in systems such as ce@xmath53la@xmath54cu@xmath46 or ce@xmath53la@xmath54b@xmath46 the concentration of ce can even reach @xmath55 .",
    "in such compounds the behaviour of ce can be considered as that of independent entities as long as the spin susceptibility and specific heat are roughly proportional to the ce concentration .      among such families of quasi stoichiometric compounds ,",
    "a recently discovered one is that of cecoin@xmath50 with one local moment per lattice unit cell , for which the phase diagram with varying pressure reveals a competition between magnetism and sc as in many other correlated electrons systems . in such stoichiometric compounds the strong electronic correlations are dominant and , if kondo physics applies one deals then with a kondo lattice of rare earth @xmath56 electron systems ( see kuramoto and kitaoka , 2000 ) .",
    "interesting new phenomena occur in such dense systems as the moments of the @xmath56 electrons usually interact with a conduction band formed by @xmath57 electrons of the same or distinct atomic species .",
    "this raised questions about the possibility of kondo singlet formation when the number of electrons available for kondo screening is the same as that to be screened .",
    "in such * kondo lattices * , can one still consider that the kondo effect is similar to that of isolated impurities ?",
    "of course , whether we consider the high @xmath1 local moment limit , or the low @xmath1 singlet state , the large concentration of sites leads to significant interactions that have to be considered .",
    "for the low @xmath1 kondo singlet ground state , intersite interactions yield a metallic behavior for the @xmath56 electrons . in that case",
    "the kondo state can be mapped out with very narrow bands with large dos that one qualifies as heavy fermions by reference to heavy fermi liquids .",
    "indeed the specific heat can be enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to that expected from the bandwidth given by band structure calculations .",
    "the occurrence of these heavy quasiparticles has been seen by quantum oscillations detected by de haas - van alphen effect on the susceptibility in compounds such as upt@xmath58 , ceru@xmath48si@xmath48 and cecu@xmath46(julian _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) .",
    "these renormalized quasiparticles are of course expected to be at the origin of the rich variety of ground states which occur there , as in other correlated electron systems .",
    "but what happens if one considers then the high @xmath1 local moment regime above the kondo temperature @xmath10 of the isolated impurities ?",
    "there the nuclear spin lattice relaxation @xmath59 is nearly @xmath1 independent , and it only acquires a @xmath1 variation close to the kondo temperature @xmath10 which is extracted from the analyses of the resistivity and the magnetic specific heat . as can be seen in * fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) * , a korringa like @xmath1 variation characteristic of the fermi liquid ground state is only reached at much lower @xmath1 .",
    "so , contrary to the single kondo impurity case where @xmath60 is the single energy scale required to describe the physics , here a second energy scale is needed .",
    "it points out a regime often labelled as @xmath49 , where the kondo singlets acquire a coherent band behavior ( yang y. _ et al .",

    "this induces an interaction between local moments which can be large enough to drive a magnetic order of the local moments at a temperature @xmath66 .",
    "its energy scale is expected to be given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the exchange interaction between @xmath56 and conduction electrons and @xmath69 is the density of conduction band states per site . but",

    "indeed 1d compounds have a very simple _ fermi surface _ which is restricted to two points at @xmath123 and -@xmath123 .",
    "this delineates a singular behavior , as in such a condition low energy electron - hole excited states can only occur for @xmath124 or @xmath125 . for higher dimension",
    "electron hole pairs with a given energy can be produced with any difference in @xmath126 values .",
    "the peculiarity in 1d is therefore that the excited quasiparticles can by no way be described as fermi liquid quasiparticles and that , whatever the strength of the electronic interactions .",
    "another peculiarity of the 1d systems is that the fermi surface always displays nesting properties near the fermi level , which can be easily seen by linearising the dispersion relations near @xmath127 , so that electronic instabilities yielding cdw or sdw ordered states are easily favored .",
    "furthermore one could notice that in 1d the displacement of an electron can not occur without a concomitant motion of all other electrons along the chain , so that any transport drives a collective excitation .",
    "the incidence of electronic interactions is therefore maximal in such systems .",
    "the peculiar electron hole pairs in 1d systems do still have a well defined width and disperion relation , and are therefore quasiparticles which constitute a luttinger liquid ( ll ) quite distinct from a fermi liquid .",
    "let us point that the excitations at @xmath124 have quite distinct significance than those at @xmath125 .",
    "those at @xmath128 determine the spin susceptibility and correspond to a limiting constant dos at low @xmath1 .",
    "they behave similarly as for a fermi liquid and give for instance in nmr a korringa @xmath1 linear contribution to the spin lattice rate @xmath25 . but",
    "the excitations at @xmath125 are quite characteristic of the luttinger liquid and involve both charge and spin excitations .",
    "the physical observables in this luttinger liquid are driven by correlation functions which display specific temperature exponents which are directly related to the strength of the electronic correlations .",
    "those can be determined theoretically ( giamarchi 2004 ) , and for instance the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate is not governed at low @xmath1 by the korringa law @xmath129 but corresponds to @xmath130 , the value of the exponent @xmath131 being connected then with the strength of the electron electron interactions , that is with @xmath132 .",
    "one expects to see a change in the nuclear relaxation exponents from a korringa law to an @xmath133 exponent at low @xmath1 . by combining nmr and transport experiments one can get the exponent controlling both spin and charge correlations ( behnia _ et al_,1995 ) .",
    "however in 1d systems charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) ordered states compete with the luttinger liquid state , so that the actual situation is such that in many practical cases the 1d luttinger behaviour is not maintained at the lowest temperatures . among the various competing ground states one finds as well peierls dimerization ( see * nmreps * ) , or a crossover towards a 2d behaviour induced by the transverse interactions between chains .",
    "the description of such complicated situations would require lengthy developments on the physics of 1d systems which would go well beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "data for the @xmath134c nuclear spins display a @xmath135 behavior in swcnt on a wide @xmath1 range from 6 to 300 k , which would correspond to a luttinger exponent of @xmath136 ( ihara _ et al _ , 2010b ) .",
    "for dwcnt , in which @xmath134c enrichment of the inner tubes had been achieved , a low @xmath1 gap in the excitations of the inner tubes is detected ( from singer _",

    "however in such quasi 1d compounds the number of carriers is difficult to modify , and the electronic properties are rather spanned by changes of transfer integrals induced by an applied pressure .",
    "a ll behaviour has been better evidenced by nmr from @xmath59 measurements on @xmath134c in single wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnt ) .",
    "such nanotubes were expected to display one dimensional behaviour ( giamarchi 2004 ) .",
    "the nmr data shown in * fig .  [ fig8 ] * does indeed evidence a power law exponent on a large @xmath1 range . conversely @xmath134c nmr data taken on the inner tubes of double wall tubes ( dwcnt ) rather exhibit a metallic state at high @xmath1 with a gap opening at low temperature ,",
    "which is not really understood so far .",
    "it could be speculatively assigned to a loss of 1d behaviour associated with nanotube curvature effects . for completeness",
    "let us mention a spin system of reduced dimensionality ( c@xmath50h@xmath137n)@xmath48cubr@xmath93 which can be considered as formed of nearly decoupled chains of singlet dimers . in those 1d chains the triplet excitations of the dimers have been shown to form a luttinger liquid ( giamarchi 2004 ) . + * in 1d systems the peculiarity of the fermi surface which is restricted to two points , and of the atomic structure , yields a breakdown of fermi liquid theories .",

    "an impurity is a local screened coulomb potential , which ideally is a uniform perturbation in * q * space , inducing a response which is inhomogeneous in real space but which reflects the response to all * q*values .",
    "so quite generally an impurity potential is a fundamental tool to probe the specific response of a pure system .",
    "for instance , the rkky oscillations induced by a local moment impurity in a classical metal are due to the singularity associated with the truncation of the response at @xmath138 . in correlated electron systems , if some singularity occurs at a specific  q value for a pure system , this singular response will dominate the modifications introduced by the impurity .",
    "for instance , in magnetic materials for which af correlations can be important at a wave vector @xmath139 , a staggered magnetic response at this wave vector is expected ( as shown in * fig .",

    "so quite generally an impurity potential is a fundamental tool to probe the specific response of a pure system , which is all the more interesting when some physical properties might be hardly measurable directly in the pure system , or when some of the hidden physical properties can be revealed by the impurity potential .",
    "nmr experiments ideally permit to map out the spatial changes occurring around extrinsic defects .",
    "those can not be accessed through macroscopic non - local techniques . here",
    "we shall evidence that in spin chains the staggered magnetism induced by defects in spin chains allows to determine by nmr the correlation functions of the _ pure _ state ( * section  [ haldane chains ] * ) .",
    "similarly in the cuprates zn or li non magnetic atoms substituted on the cu sites were shown to induce an extended paramagnetic state in their vicinity ( * section  [ magnetic properties induced by in - plane impurities in cuprates ] * ) .",

    "we shall consider such cases in * section  [ magnetism and superconductivity]*. but the case which has been considered for long as the simplest illustration of the correlated electron states is that of a mott insulator which is driven into a metallic state by an applied pressure .",
    "this mott transition should indeed exemplify the change of electronic properties induced by an increase of the @xmath218 ratio .",
    "however few compounds do exhibit a metal insulator transition which could be considered as a mott transition .",
    "the most investigated compound , which has been considered as a prototypical case since the 1960 s , is the vanadium oxide v@xmath48o@xmath58 , which undergoes an insulator to metal transition with increasing pressure or temperature above room @xmath1 .",
    "although this metal insulator transition is always taken as an example , it has been mostly studied in samples with slight cr or ti substitution on the v site that induces some doping and an uncontrolled amount of disorder . for many other cases studied ,",
    "a change in the atomic structure of the compound usually occurs at the metal insulator transition , as for instance in doped vo@xmath48 , so that band effects interfere with electronic correlations .",
    "most of these compounds have been studied dominantly by transport and optical experiments . here",
    "we shall focus in * section  [ organic and fulleride compounds ] * on some new organic and fulleride compounds in which a mott transition towards a sc state could be evidenced recently using dominantly nmr studies of the magnetic properties .",
    "while magnetism was considered to be incompatible with sc , searches for compounds where these two behaviors would coexist have been very active in the 1970s . and",
    "indeed in many actual compounds with poly - atomic unit cells , magnetism can be sustained by mott localized states on some specific atoms of the unit cell .",
    "those may have very little overlap with the extended electron states involved in bands constructed from distinct atomic orbitals in the unit cell .",
    "examples can be found in some compounds involving rare earth atoms and lighter elements such as the family of compounds discovered by chevrel ( see a review by fischer 1978 ) , an archetype being homo@xmath46s@xmath219 . here",
    "the mo@xmath46s@xmath219 units give rise to @xmath220 metallic bands while the rare earth ho@xmath187 order ferromagnetically below @xmath221 k , so that magnetism and metallicity can be considered as independent . in that case a classic bcs superconductivity with @xmath222 k is sustained by the @xmath220 bands .",
    "this @xmath11 being small , superconductivity is nevertheless suppressed below @xmath221 k by the large internal field induced on the mo sites in the magnetic ordered state of ho@xmath187 .",
    "another example is again that of the yba@xmath48cu@xmath58o@xmath79 cuprate family in which y can be replaced by any rare earth @xmath51 element .",
    "for instance in the compound gdba@xmath48cu@xmath58o@xmath79 , the gd@xmath187 ions remain well isolated with a local magnetic moment of @xmath223 very weakly coupled to the electronic states of the cuo@xmath48 plane which are responsible for the 2d correlated metallic behavior and superconductivity .",
    "the coupling is so small that the metallic and sc properties of the cuo@xmath48 planes are absolutely identical to those of yba@xmath48cu@xmath58o@xmath79 with @xmath224 values which differ by at most 1 k. however the small transfer integrals are sufficient to induce a weak coupling between gd ionic spin states with an antiferromagnetic ordering of the gd moments below a nel temperature @xmath225 k.    such specific situations of coexistence between magnetism and metallic behavior are not so difficult to understand and to model . in cuprates , from what we have seen in the previous chapters , the strange metal occurs in the correlated band of the cuo@xmath48 planes , which remains the same for the y and gd compounds . but the actual situations which of course trigger most interest are those where correlations and metallic transport occur on electronic bands of the same atomic species as in the cuo@xmath48 plane of the cuprates or in some of the the heavy fermion compounds introduced in * section [ heavy fermions and kondo lattices]*. in such compounds the metallic behavior can be induced either by doping as for the cuprates , or by pressure , a situation we shall consider in more detail below for organic compounds .",
    "recently , metal insulator transitions have been found to occur under applied pressure in organic materials either of the bedt - ttf family or in the fulleride compound cs@xmath58c@xmath226 .",
    "the transfer integrals between the organic or the fullerene c@xmath226 molecules in such compounds are mostly occurring through van der waals interactions .",
    "these materials are therefore highly compressible and rather weak applied pressures are sufficient to control the bandwidth so that a large range of @xmath218 values can be spanned in their phase diagrams . for instance a transition from a 2d sdw metal to a superconductor can be seen in one of the ( bedt - ttf)@xmath48x compounds to be discussed below .",
    "data taken at fixed @xmath1 versus pressure in the organic ( bedt - ttf)@xmath48x compounds evidence a first order transition from the mott insulating to the metallic state . * ( b ) * the pressure of the mott transition shifts with increasing @xmath1 and defines the red transition line . the latter crosses over towards a continuous transition above a critical temperature .",
    "the magnetic and sc regimes are delineated in the phase diagram ( from kagawa _ et al .",
    "_ , 2009).,width=453,height=264 ]    as for cs@xmath58c@xmath226 , which is a 3d mott insulator at ambient pressure , it is driven into a correlated sc state by application of a few kbar pressure . for both types of materials ,",
    "the nmr has been quite useful in the determination of their phase diagrams .",
    "being sensitive to the magnetic properties , nmr data have also permitted thorough characterization of the magnetic properties on the insulating side of the mott transition .      in the ( bedt - ttf)@xmath48x compounds the organic molecules have a quasi triangular structure and the phase diagram depends somewhat of the actual anion x introduced between the organic salt layers .",
    "nmr permitted to evidence that in the mott insulator case the compound with x = cu@xmath227 $ ] cl displays an af state at low @xmath1 and becomes under pressure a sc with the highest @xmath228 k found so far in organic compounds ( * fig .",

    "= cu@xmath48(cn)@xmath58 a less ordered magnetic phase not far from a spin liquid occurs and the sc state @xmath229 k is lower ( kurosaki _ et al .",
    "this has been ascribed to changes in the anisotropy ratio @xmath230 of transfer integrals in the distorted triangular lattice , which corresponds to an increase of the frustration in the latter compound .",
    "this system therefore exhibits a unique situation of a pressure induced mott transition between a frustrated spin liquid and a sc state .",
    "although the fullerene compound has a 3d cubic structure , quite remarkable analogies have been found as two distinct phases of cs@xmath58c@xmath226 can be synthesized as has been evidenced from their @xmath231cs nmr spectra and powder x - ray diffraction data . here - again",
    "a well defined nel af order is found to set in at @xmath232 k in the insulating phase of the a15 structure ( * fig .",
    "[ fig18](a ) * ) . on the contrary in the fcc - cs@xmath58c@xmath226 phase , which is not a bipartite structure ,",
    "more frustration occurs and spin liquid like magnetic fluctuations dominate down to much lower temperatures in the mott phase ( ihara _ et al . _",
    "a still poorly characterized frozen spin state only occurs below a few k in this fcc - cs@xmath58c@xmath226 phase .",
    "finally , in these cs@xmath58c@xmath226 compounds the lattice structure is not found to be modified at the mott transition , both from x- ray data and from the nmr spectra . in the fcc",
    "phase the three usually detected cs sites are seen both in the mott insulating and metallic states . in the a15-cs@xmath58c@xmath226",
    ", the cs occupies a single crystallographic site which is not in a cubic environment .",
    "therefore a seven line quadrupole splitting @xmath181 of the @xmath231cs nmr ( @xmath233 ) is detected .",
    "the analysis of the spectra through the insulator to metal transition only reveals a variation of @xmath181 though the transition which can be associated with a weak variation of the cell parameter . furthermore the @xmath72 first order mott transition pressure is found to evolve with increasing @xmath1 in all these compounds . in the organic salts the evolution of the @xmath234 transition line stops at a critical point ( @xmath235,@xmath236 ) , so that these mott transitions have all the characteristics of a liquid vapor transition ( * fig .",
    "[ fig17](b ) * ) .",
    "indeed at temperatures higher than @xmath236 the compound can be brought continuously with increasing @xmath178 from the insulating paramagnetic state to the high @xmath1 bad metal regime without crossing any symmetry breaking line .",
    "this could be seen directly ( kagawa _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) in the organic salts by @xmath32 data taken on @xmath134c enriched samples , for which the discontinuity at the transition disappears above the critical point .      concerning the sc properties the situation is quite distinct within these two types of compounds .",
    "in the organic salts the sc is suspected to be exotic with @xmath57 wave symmetry and to be mediated by af fluctuations though very clear experiments establishing that are not yet available .",
    "c@xmath226 compound which is a mott insulator at low @xmath1 with a nel temperature independent of pressure up to the first order transition to the metallic and sc state at 5 kbar .",

    "one can see that it increases regularly with increasing @xmath238 , even when @xmath11 goes through its maximum value . here",
    "the cases of the dense rb@xmath58c@xmath226 and k@xmath58c@xmath226 compounds are used as well ( wzietek _ et al .",
    "_ 2014).,width=453,height=264 ]    in the alkali fulleride @xmath239c@xmath226 compounds the occurrence of @xmath6 wave superconductivity due to the interaction of electrons with the on ball optical phonon modes has been claimed quite early as a bcs picture ( see * rmneps * ) with a gap @xmath240 and a hebel slichter peak have been evidenced experimentally by nmr . however the occurrence of strong electronic correlations in the @xmath241c@xmath226 compounds with @xmath242 has been established and it has been claimed for long that these electronic correlations were essential as well to justify the high @xmath11 values found in the sc compounds .    the discovery of the cs@xmath58c@xmath226 expanded fulleride and of its mott transition is clearly confirming that idea and has permitted recently to study the evolution of the sc state properties when approaching the mott transition .",
    "the phase diagram displays an original behaviour with a dome shape of @xmath11 versus pressure which suggests a weakening of sc when approaching the mott transition . on the contrary @xmath134c and @xmath231cs nmr @xmath32 measurements of the superconducting gap @xmath243",
    "do give evidence that @xmath243 increases continuously when approaching the mott transition .",
    "correspondingly , near the mott transition @xmath244 increases regularly and exceeds the bcs value all over the @xmath11 dome ( * fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] * ) .",
    "so we can conclude that these organic and fullerene compounds are excellent examples permiiting to probe how electronic correlations near a mott transition modify sc either mediated by phonons or by af fluctuations .",
    "+ * a limited number of compounds can be driven from a mott insulating state to a superconducting state though a mott transition by application of a hydrostatic pressure .",
    "we present here the two specific cases of 2d molecular organic triangular lattices and of 3d cubic alkali fullerides cs@xmath58c@xmath226 . in both cases",
    "nmr experiments permit to monitor the mott transition from ordered af states or a frustrated spin state towards superconductivity .",
    "this might permit to study continuously the evolution of the sc state with the increase of correlations near the first order mott transition . *",
    "most , if not all , the discoveries which have been done since the 1980 s on correlated electron systems resulted from extensive experimental investigations . in this article",
    "i have shown that the nmr technique has been quite successful in this process .",
    "this has been exemplifed here by revealing some of the most important problems highly debated nowadays in correlated electron physics .",
    "the main impact of nmr comes about as preliminary experiments can be done on powder materials which are not perfect .",
    "the second aspect which highlights this technique is that nmr results , which are not surface sensitive , are quite reproducible so that most results presented here have usually been confirmed by independent investigations done in different laboratories on distinct sample materials .",
    "all this is eased by the fact that nmr experiments allow one to detect the incidence of defects and disorder effects on the very samples on which the data are taken .",
    "we have shown here that the introduction of specific defects , associated with the capability to detect locally their incidence is a powerful tool to unravel the properties of the pure material .",
    "a similar advantage has been highlighted as well for the stm techniques , which however require samples with sufficient surface quality .    as emphasized in many instances in this article , nmr permits to probe on the local scale a large set of relevant physical quantities ranging from the ordered spin or charge states , the spin fluctuations , the superconducting properties etc .. in insulating systems the nmr experiments in frustrated materials have permitted to establish the existence of spin liquid states which can be described by rvb physics . in metallic correlated electron systems ,",
    "an important aspect is the ability to identify by nmr the electronic band(s ) which are involved in the metallic state and to establish whether magnetism is associated with different degrees of freedom or due to the same bands .",
    "this permits for instance to delineate whether kondo screened moments are at the origin of coherent bands in given heavy fermion systems .",
    "similarly one can distinguish which sites or bands are responsible for magnetism and transport in charge ordered cases such as cobaltates .",
    "one would expect as well some band selectivity in multiband systems such as the newly discovered fe pnictides or chalcogenides .",
    "concerning the metal insulator transitions , nmr helps to distinguish the situations where the transition is linked with gap openings at the fermi level due to cdw or peierls transitions , from those initiated by disorder or by mott physics .",
    "in fact the notion of mott  hubbard transition has revealed that it should be possible to treat the electronic structure of a mott insulator and of a metallic state within a unique framework .",
    "although major steps have been taken in this direction , this is far from being achieved .",
    "the developments currently under way on organic and fulleride compounds which undergo pressure induced mott transitions toward metallic superconducting states should trigger theoretical developments at the forefront of the research on the physics of correlated electron systems .",
    "coming to sc , one of the points which has attracted most attention is its interference ( destructive or constructive ) with metallic magnetism .",
    "the cuprates are in that respect certainly exotic superconductors , in which the incidence of electron correlations and af short range interactions can be essential to drive superconductivity , or at least enhance the sc transition temperatures .",
    "many other materials have been shown to display situations where magnetism and sc are proximate to each - other in phase diagrams . in fe superconductors ( pnictides or chalcogenides )",
    "the phase diagrams are sometimes spanned by doping as in the cuprates , but in other families of compounds the phase diagrams are spanned by pressure control of the overlap integrals as for organic , heavy fermions or cs@xmath245c@xmath226 compounds .    in most of these cases a thorough experimental characterization of the sc order parameter symmetry is needed prior to any determination of the pairing glue , and nmr data can be helpful in that respect .",
    "the d - wave symetry of the order parameter for cuprates is considered as the strongest indication that electronic correlations could be responsible for the pairing in these compounds . even for materials less correlated than the cuprates",
    "the incidence of electronic correlations is definitely less detrimental to sc than initially expected and the existence of af correlations in the material could as well be the boson field mediating the sc state .",
    "many possible glues between electrons such as phonons , af fluctuations , charge correlations near a quantum critical point , have been considered and may be at work in distinct materials .",
    "but all this is far from being settled and requires thorough investigations specific to the various families of correlated eletcron materials .",

    "<S> electron - electron interactions are at the origin of many exotic electronic properties of materials which have emerged from recent experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> the main important phenomena discovered are related with electronic magnetic properties , which have been quite accessible to nuclear magnetic resonance techniques . </S>",
    "<S> those specifically permit to distinguish the orbitals or electronic bands responsible for the magnetism , the metallic properties and superconductivity and to reveal the physical properties which are distinct from expectations in an independent electron scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the description of some selected experimental cases permits us to underline the importance of the technique and to reveal altogether to the reader a wide range of novel phenomena specific to correlated electron physics . </S>"
