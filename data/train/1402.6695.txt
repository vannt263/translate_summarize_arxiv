    "gravity and dark energy govern the structure in the universe at the largest scales but complex baryonic processes like cooling , heating , self - gravity and star formation are important at galactic scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations have made tremendous progress in understanding galaxy formation , starting from pure gravitational n - body simulations to the current models which try to model the aforementioned complex processes .",
    "modeling the gravitationally - interacting dark matter is straightforward in principle , and only limited by the available computing power . but",
    "the modeling of baryonic processes is rather involved .",
    "in particular , there is no consensus on which baryonic processes are important and how they should be implemented numerically .",
    "given the dynamic range of scales , from large scale structure ( 10s of mpc ) to an individual star forming cloud ( @xmath4pc ) , simulations have to resort to unresolved ` subgrid ' models for star formation and feedback due to star formation ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while different star formation recipes seem to give similar star formation histories and stellar mass distributions , provided molecular clouds are resolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) , simulations are quite sensitive to the various feedback prescriptions ( e.g. , thermal feedback due to supernovae , momentum injection via dust absorbing / scattering photons produced by massive stars and supernovae ) even with high resolution .",
    "stars form in clusters and super - star - clusters ( 100s to @xmath5 stars ) of various sizes and in different environments , ranging from low density galactic outskirts to dense galactic centers ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these clusters are observed to disrupt the dense molecular clouds in which they are born ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this stellar feedback ( due to strong radiation , stellar winds and supernovae ) disperses cold gas and suppresses further star formation . because of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and the main sequence lifetimes , the energy input is roughly constant per unit time over the life time of stars more massive than @xmath6 ( @xmath7 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , stellar feedback is sometimes modeled as a constant luminosity driven blast wave ( @xcite ) . a superbubble ( sb )",
    "expands faster than an isolated supernova remnant ( snr ) because of continuous energy injection , and suffers smaller cooling losses because most supernovae ( sne ) go off in a low density bubble .    the hot bubble breaks out through the gas disk if the outer shock driven by overlapping sne crosses the scale height with a sufficient mach number within the starburst lifetime ( e.g. , see section 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "after breakout the hot , metal - rich stellar ejecta is spread out into the galactic halo via the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "spreading of metals over large scales is required to explain the high metallicity observed in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , far away from the stellar disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "standard models for feedback through multiple sne assume that a fraction @xmath8 of the total explosion energy is retained in the hot ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this fraction is much larger than the estimates for a single snr ( @xmath9 ) after the radiative phase at @xmath0 myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there are further radiative and adiabatic losses , such that over the timescale of order tens of myr , the available mechanical energy in the bubble and shell is a negligible ( @xmath10 ) fraction of the initial supernova ( sn ) energy input .",
    "recently @xcite argued that sbs created by multiple sne in a star cluster are more effective as a feedback mechanism , in comparison to incoherent sne .",
    "recent simulations of interacting sne by @xcite show that the fractional energy retained as thermal energy in the hot ism can be as large as @xmath11 only if the explosions are spatially and temporally correlated such that the radiative losses are effectively compensated by new explosions .",
    "sbs produced by compact star clusters are expected to satisfy this condition . in this paper",
    "we assume all sne to be coincident , a good approximation if the snr , when it becomes radiative , encompasses the whole cluster .",
    "this makes sbs a more effective feedback agent which is responsible for magnificent galactic outflows .",
    "in addition to elucidating differences between isolated sne and sbs , we compare various methods of injecting sn energy in numerical simulations of the ism .",
    "different feedback processes , such as radiation pressure , photoionization , and cosmic rays , are important in explaining outflows in galaxies of different masses and redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we only focus on the most important feedback component , namely , thermal feedback due to sne .",
    "we find that the sn thermal energy must be deposited over a sufficiently small volume for it to create a hot bubble and to have an impact on the surroundings .",
    "for a large energy deposition radius the cooling time is shorter than the thermalization timescale and thermal feedback is artificially suppressed .",
    "most early implementations of sn feedback suffered from this problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    the formation of a low density bubble is essential for thermal sn feedback to work because the energy of subsequent sne is deposited in the low density bubble and is not radiated instantaneously ; cooling is only restricted to the outer shock .",
    "while this fact has been appreciated ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we present _ quantitative _ conditions for the formation of a strong shock and a hot , dilute bubble for different thermal feedback prescriptions .",
    "the main culprit responsible for the inefficacy of thermal feedback , in both eulerian ( e.g. , @xcite ) and lagrangian ( @xcite ) simulations , is the lack of resolution . in reality",
    ", a sn affects its surroundings starting at small ( @xmath12 1 pc ) scales by launching very fast ejecta ( @xmath13 km s@xmath14 ) into the ism ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "simulations in which sn energy is not deposited at small enough scales have to resort to artificial measures ( turning off cooling for several energy injection timescales , depositing energy into artificial ` hot ' phase that does not cool , etc . ) in order for feedback to have any impact at all on the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these measures are necessary for including the effects of supernova heating in large - scale simulations .",
    "the continuous injection of mass and energy by sne deep within the hot sb is expected to launch a steady wind ( as first calculated by @xcite ; hereafter cc85 ) .",
    "cc85 obtained analytic solutions for a superwind assuming a constant thermal energy and mass input rate with an injection radius . by modeling realistic sne as fast moving ejecta within sbs",
    "we show that a steady cc85 wind is obtained only if a large number of sne ( @xmath3 ) go off within the star cluster . for a smaller number of sne , an individual sn s kinetic energy",
    "is not thermalized within a small injection radius and there is an unsteady outflow .",
    "this should have implications for works that simply assume a cc85 wind within the sb .",
    "our paper presents analytic results that can be readily used for the numerical implementation of thermal feedback using various recipes .",
    "these analytic criteria are verified and extended using idealized numerical simulations . the fundamental difference between isolated supernovae and superbubbles  that the former is ineffective on galactic scales ",
    "is highlighted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : fb_pres ] we describe various ways of implementing thermal feedback due to sne .",
    "section [ sec : num_sim ] describes the numerical setup used to study sne and sbs . in section [ sec :",
    "anal ] we present different analytic criteria for feedback to work with a range of feedback prescriptions .",
    "we also derive the conditions for obtaining a thermalized cc85 wind within a sb . in section [ sec : results ] we present 1-d numerical simulations of different feedback recipes with and without cooling , and compare the results with our analytic estimates .",
    "we also briefly discuss the effects of magnetic fields and thermal conduction . in section [ sec : conc ]",
    "we discuss the implications of our results on galaxy formation , feedback simulations , and on galactic wind observations .",
    "although ism is multiphase and extremely complex , for simplicity we consider a uniform , static model with a given density ( typically @xmath15 @xmath16 ) and temperature ( @xmath17 k corresponding to the warm ism ) .",
    "we do not consider stratification because the disk scale height is typically a few 100 pc and the fizzling of sn feedback is essentially a small scale problem .",
    "moreover , the scales of interest ( 100s of pc ; few myr ) are much bigger than the cluster size and the local ism / circumstellar inhomogeneities . for simplicity",
    "we also assume that all sne explode at @xmath18 .",
    "this is a good approximation because the size of a typical ( super ) star - cluster is smaller than the bubble size at the beginning of the radiative phase .    the sn prescriptions that we consider in our analytic estimates and numerical simulations cover the full range of methods used in the literature .",
    "these are :    1 .   _ kinetic explosion models _ ( ke ) : in these models the sn energy ( @xmath19 , chosen to be 1 bethe @xmath20 erg ) is given to a specified ejecta mass ( @xmath21 , chosen to be 1 @xmath22 ) distributed uniformly with an ejecta density @xmath23 within an ejecta radius @xmath24 .",
    "the ejecta velocity is homologous with @xmath25 within the ejecta ; the normalization is such that the kinetic energy of the ejecta is @xmath19 ; i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "the ejecta temperature is taken to be small ( @xmath27 k ) .",
    "after every ( fixed ) sn injection time @xmath28 the innermost @xmath24 of the volume is _ overwritten _ by the ejecta density and velocity , thereby pumping sn energy into the ism . after the reverse shock propagates toward the bubble center ,",
    "once the swept - up mass is comparable to the ejecta mass , the bubble density structure is fairly insensitive to the ejecta density distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model most closely resembles a physical snr in early stages at small ( @xmath12 1 pc ) scales when the sn ` piston ' at large speed rams into the ism .",
    "this prescription is not widely used in galaxy formation simulations ( there are some exceptions , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   _ thermal explosion models _ ( te ) : in these models the energy is deposited within the ejecta radius in form of thermal energy at an interval of @xmath28 . there are two variants of this model . in one class ,",
    "the mass and internal energy densities are _ overwritten _ within the ejecta radius ( @xmath24 ) such that the _ uniformly distributed _",
    "ejecta thermal energy is @xmath19 ( 1 bethe ) and the _ uniformly distributed _ ejecta mass is @xmath29 .",
    "we abbreviate these models as teo and they behave like ke models .",
    "the second class of models is where we _ add _ ( in contrast to overwrite ) the ejecta mass ( with uniform density ) to the preexisting mass and the ejecta thermal energy ( distributed uniformly ) to the preexisting internal energy within @xmath24 .",
    "we refer to these models as tea .",
    "there are significant differences between the tea and teo / ke models in presence of cooling because tea ejecta can become radiative if thermal energy is added to a dense ism .",
    "most models in the literature are analogous to tea models with some variations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; some works such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite unphysically turn off cooling for some time for sn feedback to have an impact ) . sometimes all the sn energy is deposited in a single grid cell ( e.g. , @xcite ) or in a single particle ( e.g. , sn particle method in section 3.2.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "luminosity driven models _ ( ld ) : as discussed earlier , for typical imfs , the mechanical energy input due to ob stars per unit time is roughly constant .",
    "this motivates a model in which internal energy and mass within an injection radius ( denoted by @xmath24 ) increase at a constant rate corresponding to internal energy @xmath19 and mass @xmath21 for each sn",
    ". some of the works that use this prescription are @xcite .",
    "all our models are identified with the number of ob stars @xmath30 ( which equals the number of sne in the star cluster ) or luminosity @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the lifetime of the ob association ( taken to be 30 myr ) and @xmath33 is the time interval between sne .",
    "we note that the overwrite models do not strictly conserve mass and energy .",
    "while the supernova energy is much larger than the overwritten thermal energy , one needs to choose a small enough ejecta radius such that the overwritten mass is subdominant relative to the ejecta mass .",
    "the explosion models are substantially slower compared to the smooth luminosity driven models because of very high temperatures created due to sudden energy injection in the former .",
    "in this section we describe the numerical setup corresponding to our one - dimensional simulations discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "our numerical simulations use the ism setup and the various feedback prescriptions described in section [ sec : fb_pres ] .",
    "the ism density and temperature are chosen to 1 @xmath16 and @xmath17 k , respectively , unless specified otherwise .",
    "the mean mass per particle is @xmath34 and per electron is @xmath35 .",
    "the initial density and temperature are uniform , and the velocity is zero .",
    "we use the grid - based zeus - mp code in spherical , one - dimensional geometry ( @xcite ) to solve the standard euler equations with source terms mimicking sn energy / momentum / mass injection for the chosen feedback model , and a sink term in the internal energy equation representing radiative cooling .",
    "our equations are similar but not identical to eqs .",
    "20 - 22 in @xcite .",
    "we note that the zeus code does not conserve energy to the machine precision .",
    "however , we have confirmed that energy conservation holds to better than 90% in most of our runs .",
    "in fact , the sedov - taylor blast wave in 1-d spherical coordinates is one of the standard test problems presented in @xcite ; the numerical results match analytic solutions very closely .",
    "while most of our runs are hydro , in section [ sec : b_cond ] we briefly discuss runs with simple models of magnetic fields and thermal conduction ; various parameters for these runs are discussed there .",
    "the radial velocity is set to zero at the inner radial boundary and other fluid variables are copied in the ghost cells .",
    "outflow boundary conditions are applied at the outer radial boundary .",
    "note that the outer boundary is out of causal contact .",
    "since the setup produces strong shocks , we use the standard zeus artificial viscosity to prevent unphysical oscillations at shocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cfl number of 0.2 is found to be more robust compared to the standard value of 0.5 , and is used in all the simulations .",
    "the cooling function that we use is the collisional - ionization - equilibrium based solar metallicity table of @xcite , with the cooling function set to zero below @xmath17 k. the cooling step is implemented via operator splitting using the semi - implicit method of @xcite . cooling is subcycled and the number of subcycles is limited to be less than 100 .",
    "most of our runs use a 1024 resolution grid extending from 1 pc to 2 kpc .",
    "a logarithmically spaced grid is used to better resolve smaller radii ; there are equal number of grid points covering 1 pc to @xmath36 pc and @xmath36 pc to 2 kpc .",
    "some runs with stronger sn feedback use a larger spatial extent ( c.f .",
    "@xmath37 runs in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] ) , and some uniform very high resolution runs ( 16384 grid points ; c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : d_t ] ) use a smaller extent ( 1 to 200 pc ) .",
    "all our simulations ( except the very high resolution ones that are run for 3 myr ) are run for 30 myr , typical age of a young star cluster .",
    "in this section we present the analytic criteria that need to be satisfied for various feedback models discussed in section [ sec : fb_pres ] to work .",
    "these analytic estimates help us understand the results of numerical simulations discussed in section [ sec : results ] . while radiative cooling is the most discussed phenomenon in the context of fizzling sn feedback , the feedback prescription should satisfy additional constraints for the energy input to couple realistically with the ism .",
    "a recurring concept in what follows is that of thermalization ; i.e. , in order to be effective the input energy should have time to couple to the ism before it is radiated or is overwritten . in section [ sec : cc85 ]",
    "we show that a steady superwind within a superbubble , as envisaged by @xcite , occurs only if the number of sne is sufficiently large .    in the following sections we derive upper limits on the ejecta radius within which the feedback energy must be deposited for it to be effective .",
    "we can easily convert this radius limit into a critical mass resolution needed in smooth - particle - hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations ; namely , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the ism density , @xmath40 is the number of neighbors used in the sph smoothing kernel and @xmath41 is the maximum sph gas particle mass required for feedback to work .        in models where energy within the ejecta radius is overwritten ( ke , teo )",
    "the ejecta radius should be smaller than a critical radius ( @xmath42 ) for the input energy to get coupled to the ism .",
    "the critical radius equals the sedov - taylor shock radius at @xmath28 , because the shock quickly transitions from a free - expanding to a sedov - taylor state ; the sedov - taylor radius ( when the swept up ism mass equals the ejecta mass ) is @xmath43 , much smaller than the estimate in eq .",
    "[ eq : r_therm ] , where @xmath44 is the ejecta mass in solar units . ] the time lag between sne , [ eq : r_therm ] r_crit ( ) ^1/5 50  pc  n^-1/5 e_ej,51 ^ 1/5 t_sn,0.3 ^ 2/5 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath45 ) is the ism ( number ) density ( assuming @xmath34 ) , @xmath46 is the ejecta energy in units of @xmath47 erg , and @xmath48 is the time between consecutive sne in units of @xmath49 myr . if the ejecta radius is larger than this value the ejecta energy is overwritten before it can push the outer shock .",
    "thus , in such a case , the input sn energy is overwritten without much affecting the ism .      for thermal sn feedback to launch a strong shock the energy",
    "should be deposited over a small enough volume , such that the post - shock pressure is much larger than the ism pressure .",
    "this is equivalent to demanding the outer shock velocity to be much larger than the sound speed in the ism .",
    "the shock velocity ( @xmath50 ; @xmath51 is the outer shock radius ) , expressed in terms of the shock radius in sedov - taylor stage , is @xmath52 for an isolated sn and @xmath53 for a luminosity driven sb ( @xcite ) .",
    "the condition for a strong shock for an isolated sn is ( @xmath54 ; @xmath55 is the ism isothermal sound speed ) [ eq : r_sn ] r_ej 174  pc  e_ej,51 ^ 1/3 n^-1/3 t_4 ^ -1/3 and for a sb is ( see eq . 3 in @xcite ) [ eq : r_sb ] r_ej 1.5   kpc  l_ej,38 ^ 1/2 n^-1/2 t_4 ^ -3/4 , where @xmath56 is the ejecta luminosity ( @xmath57 for explosion models ) in units of @xmath58 erg s@xmath14 ( this corresponds to @xmath59 over @xmath60 myr ) and @xmath61 is the ism temperature in units of @xmath17 k.    the sonic constraint ( @xmath54 ) is typically less restrictive than the compactness requirements due to cooling in a dense ism ( see next section ) .",
    "@xcite , who considered supernova feedback in the hot ism ( @xmath62 k ) of galaxy clusters and elliptical galaxies , found that the shock can quickly ( when outer radius is only @xmath63 pc ; see eq .",
    "[ eq : r_sn ] ) decelerate to attain the sound speed in the hot ism .",
    "after this the outer shock propagates as a sound wave .",
    "while the sound wave can spread the sn energy over a larger radius ( @xmath64 for a sound wave , unlike a strong blast wave in which @xmath65 ) , energy dissipation is not as efficient as in shocks .        in luminosity driven models ( ld ) ,",
    "sn feedback does not fizzle out ( in fact , the shock can get started ) only if the cooling rate is smaller than the energy deposition rate , i.e. , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 $ ] is the cooling function ) , or [ eq : lum_fizzle ] r_ej 20  pc  l_ej,38 ^ 1/3 n^-2/3 _",
    "-22 ^ -1/3 , where @xmath68 is the cooling function in units of @xmath69 erg @xmath70 s@xmath14 .",
    "the above criterion ( eq . [ eq : lum_fizzle ] ) for the luminosity driven models is quite different from the criterion that we now derive for the widely used thermal explosion models with energy and mass addition ( tea model in section [ sec : fb_pres ] ) .",
    "since energy is _ added _ to the ( possibly dense ) pre - existing medium , cooling in this model can be substantial .",
    "in contrast , since the ejecta density is low , cooling losses are smaller in the overwriting models ( ke , teo ) . for tea models to launch a shock , radiative losses over the timescale in which the shock from a point explosion reaches the ejecta radius , [ eq : t_therm ] t_ej = e_ej^-1/2 r_ej^5/2 ^1/2 , should be smaller than the energy deposited ( here @xmath39 is the density of the medium in which energy is injected , not necessarily the ism density ) ; i.e. , [ eq : cool_cond ] n^2 t_ej 3 e_ej/4r_ej^3 . plugging in the expression for @xmath71 ,",

    "this condition is much more restrictive than the one obtained by replacing @xmath71 in eq .",
    "[ eq : cool_cond ] by the cfl stability timestep .",
    "moreover , this is the appropriate timescale to use because the relevant timescale for the injected energy to couple to the ism is the thermalization time ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have used similar arguments and derived results not too different from ours for the thermal explosion addition models . a slight difference from our work",
    "is that they consider energy deposition over a resolution element ( a necessity because of a larger range of scales in cosmological galaxy simulations ) , but we allow for energy deposition over a resolved region . @xcite",
    "have expressed their resolution limit in terms of the cooling rate per unit mass and @xcite in terms of the post - shock temperature ; we use the cooling function ( @xmath72 ) to express the critical radius within which the energy needs to be deposited .      in models where the energy and mass densities are overwritten within @xmath24 ,",
    "the condition for overcoming cooling losses and launching a shock is @xmath73 where ejecta number density @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; note that this expression is different from eq .",
    "[ eq : cool_cond ] in that the ejecta density is used instead of the ism density .",
    "the overwrite models ( ke , teo ) behave quite differently from addition ( tea , ld ) models because a larger ejecta radius means a smaller density ejecta to which energy is added . replacing the ism density by the ejecta density in eq .",

    "-22 ^ 1/2 e_ej,51 ^ -3/4 . in order to avoid radiative losses the ejecta radius should be _ larger _ than above .",
    "this early cooling of the mass loaded sn ejecta , responsible for creating cold filaments in young sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is physical ( unlike fizzling out of the energy addition models ) and should reduce the energy available to drive the sn .",
    "all our simulations use an ejecta radius much greater than this limit .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter cc85 ) found analytic solutions for a luminosity driven wind with a fixed injection radius .",
    "luminosity injection is expected to drive both an outer shock bounding the bubble and a wind that shocks within the hot bubble at the termination shock ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ; see also ld run in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] ) . in this section",
    "we show that for a small number of sne ( c.f .",
    "[ eq : cc_crit ] ) the sn ejecta does not thermalize within the termination shock . in that case , the density inside the bubble is much lower than the cc85 wind because most sne occur in the dilute bubble created by earlier sne and the thermalization radius is comparable to the outer shock radius .",
    "this has important implications on cooling and luminosity of sn ejecta .",
    "following @xcite , the outer shock radius of a luminosity driven bubble is given by @xmath77 , velocity by @xmath78 , and the post - shock pressure by @xmath79 .",
    "assuming a steady superwind , the ram pressure at the termination shock ( @xmath80 ; the wind is assumed to be supersonic at this radius ) is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the wind velocity , @xmath83 is the density upstream of the termination shock , and @xmath84 is the mass injection rate .",
    "the wind termination shock ( @xmath80 ) is located where the wind ram pressure balances the bubble pressure ; i.e. , @xmath85 using @xmath53 and @xmath86 gives , [ eq : r_ts ] ( ) ^1/2 0.08 e_ej , 51 ^ -1/12 m_ej , ^1/4 n^-1/6 r_os , 2 ^ -1/3 t_sn , 0.3 ^ -1/6 , where @xmath87 is the outer shock radius in units of 100 pc , @xmath88 is the time between sne normalized to 0.3 myr ( corresponding to @xmath59 ) ; we have used @xmath57 and @xmath89 .",
    "the ratio @xmath90 depends very weakly on time ( @xmath91 ) ; this comes from the time dependence of @xmath51 in eq .",
    "[ eq : r_ts ] .",
    "the reverse shock for an isolated sn very quickly ( at the beginning of sedov - taylor stage ) collapses to a point but the termination shock for a sb is present at all times . thus the non - radiative termination shock can power a sb long after the outer shock becomes radiative , unlike a sn which dies off shortly after the outer shock becomes radiative ( see section [ sec : energy_budget ] for our results from simulations ) .",
    "the condition for the existence of a smooth cc85 wind is that the ejecta thermalization radius should be smaller than the termination shock radius .",
    "the superwind is mass loaded by previous sne ( the bubble density in the absence of mass loading is quite small because most of the mass is swept up in the outer shell ) . the swept up mass till radius @xmath92 in a cc85 wind is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the wind density profile ; here we have assumed that the swept up mass is dominated by the supersonic portion of the wind . now",
    "the thermalization radius ( the radius within which the deposited energy is thermalized and which should correspond to cc85 s injection radius ) of the ejecta is where the swept up mass roughly equals the ejecta mass , or [ eq : rth_cc ] r_th v_ts t_sn 3  kpc  e_ej , 51 ^ 1/2 m_ej , ^-1/2 t_sn , 0.3 .",
    "since the thermalization radius is quite large , a thermalized cc85 solution will only occur for large clusters ( with shorter @xmath28 , the time lag between sne ) ; for modest star clusters the ejecta will only thermalize beyond the termination shock . of course",

    "we carry out a 1024 resolution hydro run with thermal conduction to study its qualitative influence . however , it is difficult to determine the ism conductivity in a magnetized ( presumably turbulent ) plasma",
    ". therefore , we use the spitzer value with a suppression factor of 0.2 ( see eq . 11 in @xcite ) . moreover , since the bubble can become very hot such that the diffusion approximation breaks down , we limit the conductivity to an estimate of the free streaming diffusivity ( chosen to be 2.6 @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the local isothermal sound speed and @xmath92 is the radius ) .",
    "thermal conduction is operator split , and implemented fully implicitly through a tridiagonal solver using the code s hydro time step .",
    "conduction is expected to evaporate matter from the dense shell and deposit it into a conductive layer in the bubble ; in steady state the rate of conductive transport of energy from bubble to the shell is balanced by the rate of heat advection from shell to the bubble @xcite .",
    "the outer and termination shock locations are not affected much by conduction .",
    "however , the density and temperature structure in the hot bubble is affected significantly . without conduction",
    "the bubble is very hot ( @xmath178 k ) , but with conduction the temperature drops into the x - ray range ( @xmath179 k ) and density is higher .",
    "this can enhance the x - ray emissivity of sbs ; a rough estimate of hard x - ray luminosity ( @xmath180 over the hot bubble ) at 10 myr from the right panel of figure [ fig : dt_b_cond ] is few @xmath58 erg s@xmath14 ( which is @xmath181 the energy put in by sne by that time ) .",
    "since galactic superwinds are copious x - ray emitters , we expect thermal conduction to be a very important ingredient for explaining observations .",
    "figure [ fig : rad_ratio ] confirms that the fraction of radiative losses from the bubble is much higher with conduction than without conduction because of a higher density .",
    "however , the right panel of figure [ fig : rad_loss_time ] shows that the total fractional radiative losses with thermal conduction are only slightly higher compared to the non - conductive @xmath111 sb run .",
    "we emphasize that our treatment of magnetic fields and thermal conduction is extremely simplified .",
    "realistic calculations must be done in three dimensions with tangled magnetic fields and with anisotropic thermal conduction along fields lines .",
    "however , we expect the qualitative effects of realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction to have some semblance with our simplified treatment .",
    "we have obtained several important results in this paper , on both numerical implementation of sn / sb feedback and on differences between isolated sne and sbs .",
    "sbs are a result of spatially and temporally correlated sne .",
    "since most massive stars are expected to be born in star clusters few 10s of pc in extent ( e.g. , @xcite ) , pre - sn stellar winds and first sne are expected to carve out a low density bubble , which by a fraction of myr encloses the whole star cluster ( see fig . [",
    "fig : d_t ] ) .",
    "therefore , subsequent sne happen in the low density bubble and we are in the sb regime of coherent sne ( see @xcite ) .",
    "magnificent galactic outflows , such as m82 , are powered by multiple super - star - clusters and the problem of understanding coalescing sbs is important .",
    "star clusters more massive than @xmath182 ( and hence with @xmath183 sne ) are rare ( e.g. , see @xcite ) ; therefore , the superbubbles in m82 and in our @xmath111 sb model should be considered as giant bubbles driven by 100s of overlapping superbubbles due to individual star clusters . indeed ,",
    "100s of star clusters have been observed in the central few 100 pc of m82 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that vertical stratification is important for the acceleration and assimilation of the metal - rich bubble into the halo . in this paper",
    "we consider the idealized smaller - scale problem of the behavior of isolated snrs and multiple coincident sne within a sb in a uniform ism .",
    "some of our most important results are :    * our most realistic kinetic explosion ( ke ) models ( and other models in which sn energy is _ overwritten _ ) , in which the sn energy in kinetic form is overwritten in a small volume , give correct results only if the energy is deposited within a small length scale ( see section [ sec : over ] ) ; otherwise , energy is overwritten without coupling to the ism .",
    "this is true even without considering any radiative losses . * with cooling , if feedback energy is deposited within a length scale @xmath24 larger than the critical values mentioned in section [ sec : cool_cond ] ,",
    "such that the input energy is radiated before it is thermalized , a hot bubble is not formed in the widely used luminosity driven and thermal explosion addition ( ld , tea ) models .",
    "thus sn fizzles out at early stages due to artificially large cooling losses . * with insufficient resolution and large",
    "ism densities the bubble fizzles out completely in the luminosity driven ( ld ) and thermal explosion addition ( tea ) models ( in which energy is _ added _ to the ism ; see section [ sec : fb_pres ] ) and can not have any effect on the ism ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fizzling ] ) . as also pointed out previously ( e.g. , by @xcite ) , early galactic - scale sn feedback simulations failed mainly because of this .",
    "however , for a realistic sn ( as mimicked by our ke model ) a bubble is formed and subsequent sne occuring within the non - radiative bubble power the radiative outer shock .",
    "another , probably more serious , problem faced by numerical simulations is that the sn energy is not typically put in coherently over a small volume in space and within a short interval .",
    "feedback due to sne in young star clusters is expected to be coherent and much more effective than a similar number of isolated sne ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , [ fig : rad_loss_time ] ) . for correlated sne",
    ", isolated sn bubbles overlap to form a superbubble which is powered by the non - radiative termination / internal shocks , long after the outer shock becomes radiative .",
    "in contrast , an isolated supernova becomes powerless a bit after ( @xmath184 myr ) the outer shock becomes radiative . *",
    "a smooth cc85 wind within the superbubble is possible only if the number of sne ( @xmath30 ) over the cluster lifetime is large ( i.e. , @xmath185 ) . only in these cases , individual sne going off inside the superbubble are able to thermalize within the termination shock .",
    "this result has implications for modeling the x - ray output , for example , in individual bubbles blown by star clusters and in the inner regions of galactic outflows , since the cc85 wind structure is often assumed where it may not be valid .",
    "* most of the radiative losses come from the unresolved radiative relaxation layer at the outer shock .",
    "the fractional radiative losses from the interior region , concentrated at the contact discontinuity between the shocked ism and the shocked ejecta , varies between @xmath186 , with larger losses occurring at later times .",
    "while these radiative layers are unresolved even in our highest resolution simulations , the volume integrated radiative losses in them converge even for a modest resolution . * as compared to isolated sne , superbubbles can retain a larger fraction of the initial energy of explosions as thermal / kinetic energy of the gas .",
    "isolated sne are mixed with the ism soon after they become radiative ; by few myr they are incapable of affecting the ism at all . while most energy is radiative away ( close to 100% , and not @xmath187% , as is often assumed ) for isolated sne over 10 myr , a sb can retain a fraction @xmath169 ( for @xmath15 @xmath16 ) as the bubble thermal energy + the shell kinetic energy .",
    "this fraction is only weakly affected by a higher ism density and by thermal conduction ( see the right panel of fig . [",
    "fig : rad_loss_time ] ) .",
    "thus , sbs are expected to significantly affect even a dense ism .",
    "substantial radiative losses can partly explain the smaller observed bubble sizes compared to what is expected by modeling the stellar populations ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "* the temperature profile of sbs strongly depend on thermal conduction , whose inclusion can decrease ( increase ) the temperature ( density ) and thereby enhance the x - ray luminosity . thermal conduction ( and other sources of mass loading of the hot bubble , such as turbulent mixing ) plays an important role in explaining the x - ray emission from galactic superbubbles because very little gas is expected to be in the x - ray emitting regime ( @xmath188 k ) in its absence ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dt_b_cond ] ) .",
    "our simple one - dimensional simulations show that isolated supernova remnants , owing to large radiative losses , are much weaker feedback agents compared to superbubbles driven by coherently overlapping supernovae .",
    "however , detailed three - dimensional calculations , particularly with a realistic distribution of stars in a cluster , and magnetic fields and thermal conduction , are required in order to make quantitative comparisons with observations .",
    "this will be done in future .",
