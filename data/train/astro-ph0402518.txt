    "thirty years following the discovery of the first double neutron star @xcite , only eight such systems are known .",
    "a few of these rare binaries are wonderful laboratories for the study of relativistic gravity and gravitational radiation .",
    "one of the more recently discovered of these systems , j07373039 @xcite , is fundamentally different from all of the others observationally in that it contains _ two _ detected pulsars @xcite .",
    "the first pulsar discovered in the system ( a ) spins every 22ms , has a low inferred surface magnetic field strength , a characteristic age of 210myr , and a relatively high rate of rotational energy loss , @xmath6erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "pulsar b has a period of 2.7s , a characteristic age of 50myr , and an @xmath7 that is 3600 times smaller than that of a. its mass , 1.25m@xmath8 , is the lowest known for any neutron star and is 0.09m@xmath8 less than that of a. both pulsars orbit their common center of mass every 2.4hr with eccentricity of 0.09 .",
    "we observe the system nearly edge - on , with an orbital inclination of @xmath9 .",
    "a unique aspect of the system is that radio emission from pulsar b is only detected strongly in two repeatable orbital phase ranges , each of duration @xmath10min .",
    "a @xmath11s - long eclipse of pulsar a is also observed at its superior conjunction .",
    "both of these effects most likely result from the interaction of the fast - spinning pulsar s relativistic wind with the magnetosphere of its much less energetic companion @xcite .",
    "this system will be an exceptional laboratory for relativistic astrophysics and should provide unique insights into the magnetospheres and the local environment of both neutron stars .",
    "high - energy observations , particularly at x - ray energies , could be especially valuable for understanding the energetics of the system .",
    "whether resulting from magnetospheric or thermal processes , most pulsars emit of order @xmath12 in soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "this translates to an expected luminosity of order @xmath13erg  s@xmath4 for pulsar a , and means that b should be undetectable due to its very low @xmath14 and relatively large age .",
    "but in this particular system , while still unlikely , it is conceivable that a portion of a s relativistic poynting / particle flux might heat the surface of b , perhaps causing it to emit detectable radiation .",
    "such emission could prove invaluable for probing the atmosphere of b , which is likely to deviate significantly from standard models .",
    "a more likely source of `` unusual '' x - ray emission might be the shock that undoubtedly forms near pulsar b owing to the collision between a s relativistic wind and b s magnetosphere .",
    "some of this emission could be time variable , for instance due to doppler boosting .",
    "many of these emission modes are clearly speculative and hard to quantify with the present understanding of the system .",
    "nevertheless , given the potential for unusual insights into the physics of this unique interacting binary , we have obtained a short x - ray observation of this system , awarded through the _ chandra _ director s discretionary time program , in order to better plan future multi - wavelength studies .",
    "in this letter we report the detection of a point source at the position of the j07373039 system and describe its properties .",
    "the double pulsar system j07373039 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer s - array ( acis - s ) instrument aboard _ chandra _ on 2004 january 18 for 10ksec ( corrected exposure time was 10,009s ) .",
    "the system s position was located on the aim point of the acis s3 chip .",
    "we used the ` ciao ` package , version 3.0.2 , to perform much of the analysis of these data , using the most recent release of the calibration software , ` caldb 2.26 ` , which corrects for the loss of quantum efficiency at low energies due to molecular contamination . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig : image ] , we detect a source at ( j2000 ) @xmath15 , @xmath16 . no other sources are detected in the entire s3 chip .",
    "this position is @xmath17 away from that derived from radio timing of the pulsars @xcite , well within the x - ray @xmath18 position uncertainty of @xmath19 , dominated by the satellite pointing error of approximately @xmath20 .",
    "we have therefore detected the j07373039 system in x - rays . using a circular aperture of radius @xmath21 centered on the position of the system , and four background regions ,",
    "we determine that @xmath22 counts originate from the pulsar , corresponding to a rate of @xmath23 counts / s .",
    "the system is detected as a point source , with the spatial spread consistent with the point spread function of the instrument .",
    "we used ` psextract ` to obtain a spectrum for this source and fit it using _ sherpa _ , the ` ciao ` modeling and fitting package .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , a steep power - law spectrum fits the data satisfactorily , with photon index @xmath24 and neutral hydrogen column density @xmath25@xmath26 . because of the small number of counts we use the maxium likelihood method to fit these data , implemented in _ sherpa _ with the cstat statistic @xcite .",
    "this fit returns a q - value ( i.e. , the probability that we would observe the measured cstat statistic or higher if the best - fit model is true ) of 0.96 .",
    "the best - fit blackbody and raymond - smith models return q - values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "a thermal bremsstrahlung model returns a q - value of 0.55 , but the best - fit value of @xmath29  @xmath26 is unreasonably low . fitting for multi - component models or models with more free parameters is unreasonable due to the small number of counts available . while there are only two counts with energies greater than 3kev , the fitted parameters do not change substantially if these counts are removed . similarly , the fit does not change substantially if we exclude photons with energies less than 0.5  kev , where acis - s calibration is somewhat uncertain .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows the a contour plot of the cstat statistic for the best - fit model in the @xmath30 plane . from the derived count rate and spectral fit",
    ", we calculate a 0.210kev unabsorbed flux of @xmath31erg  @xmath26  s@xmath4 .",
    "assuming isotropic emission , and for a distance @xmath32kpc , inferred from its dispersion measure ( i.e. free electron column density ) and a model for the galactic electron density @xcite , we obtain a 0.210kev luminosity of @xmath33erg  s@xmath4 . in table",
    "[ tab : xrayprops ] we list all relevant spectral quantities and their uncertainties . we stress that @xmath34 , and hence the derived luminosity , may be uncertain by a factor of two or more due to unmodeled electron density features associated with its position near the gum nebula @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations will be important for determining the actual distance .",
    "the value of @xmath35 derived for the system , while rather uncertain , is much smaller than the total galactic value of @xmath36  @xmath26 derived by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) from neutral hydrogen measurements .",
    "it is also smaller ( at @xmath37 ) than the value of @xmath38  @xmath26 derived from its dispersion measure , assuming 10 h atoms for each @xmath39 .",
    "our derived @xmath35 , however , is marginally greater than expected given the measured neutral hydrogen absorption to other sources with similar longitude , latitude and @xmath40kpc distance , and is more consistent with the measurements if a distance of at least @xmath41kpc is assumed .",
    "such discrepancies between @xmath35 measurements and dispersion - measure derived distances for pulsars are not unusual ( e.g. nicastro et al . 2004 ) . also , since the source closest to j07373039 with a neutral hydrogen absorption measurement is a radial distance of @xmath42kpc away , and because the errors on our @xmath35 and distance measurements are large , further observations are necessary to determine if such a discrepancy exists .    in figure",
    "[ fig : time ] we plot the number of photons detected in each of 10 time bins over the 10ksec observation ( i.e. 1.13 orbital periods ) .",
    "there is no significant evidence for variability , with a @xmath43 test revealing only a 51% probability that the data were drawn from a non - uniform distribution .",
    "we also do not see any correlation between time and the energy of the photons .",
    "the small number of detected photons makes searching for variability on shorter time scales impossible .",
    "we have detected the j07373039 system as a faint x - ray source that is best described by a steep power - law spectrum with @xmath24 and @xmath44erg  s@xmath4 ( see table  [ tab : xrayprops ] ) .",
    "this result is compatible with the emission originating solely from the magnetosphere of pulsar a : becker & tr \" umper ( 1999 ) find that for recycled radio pulsars that are detected at x - ray energies , @xmath45 , and that when their spectra can be fit by a power law , @xmath46 . while by comparison our spectral index is a bit steep and our efficiency for conversion of rotational to x - ray energies is a little small ( @xmath47 ^ 2 $ ] ) , uncertainties in spectral parameters and distance make this interpretation perfectly plausible .",
    "we note in passing that the x - ray luminosity detected from the system is roughly equal to the entire spin - down luminosity of pulsar b.    another intriguing possibility is that these x - rays are produced when the relativistic winds of a and b collide . as shown by arons & tavani ( 1993 ) , the synchrotron emission produced in such interactions",
    "would also be expected to have a power law x - ray spectrum with @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , the data from this short observation are not sufficient to discriminate between these two possibilities .",
    "more sensitive observations with better time resolution are necessary in order to : obtain a better spectral fit ; determine what portion of the detected x - ray flux is pulsed at the rotation period of pulsar a ; quantify better any possible time variability ( the observed radio flux density of b varies dramatically on @xmath4910min timescales that are impossible to investigate with the present data ) ; measure any thermal component that may be contributing to the total x - ray flux of this system .",
    "we thank the _ chandra _ x - ray center for approving the director s discretionary time for this observation and the anonymous referee for useful comments .",
