    "several studies have shown that at _ z _ @xmath3 2 a considerable fraction of the massive galaxies ( stellar mass @xmath7 @xmath3 10@xmath8 @xmath9 ) are compact compared to their local counterparts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rarity of compact massive galaxies at the present time implies a considerable size increase in the last 10 billion years ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent comprehensive simulations have found that the commonly used methods for measuring the sizes of these galaxies , such as fitting single - component srsic ( 1968 ) function , is reliable ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; davari et al .",
    "2016 ) , despite the fact that , in many instances , their sizes are comparable to the scale of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _  point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the compactness of high-_z _ massive galaxies strongly suggests that their formation process involved strong dissipation on rapid timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be accomplished by gas - rich major mergers ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , cold gas flows ( dekel et al .",
    "2009 ) , or some combination of the two . in support of such a scenario , the central regions of local massive ellipticals , the likely descendants of high-@xmath5 compact , massive galaxies , are old and have a high @xmath10/fe abundance ratio ( @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates an early episode of violent star formation , which would naturally accompany a gas - rich , dissipative formation event .",
    "although major mergers have long been thought to transform disky galaxies to bulge - dominated systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , more recent simulations show that this may not be always the case .",
    "in fact , gas - rich major mergers can leave large - scale disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) if the gas retains significant angular momentum during the merger ( @xcite ) , especially those that have a high gas fraction ( @xcite ) .",
    "the study of @xcite lends credence to this picture .",
    "these authors show that massive , evolved , compact galaxies at @xmath0 @xmath3 2  the so - called red nuggets  are the direct descendants of the submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; blain et al .",
    "2002 ) at @xmath0 @xmath1 3 .",
    "smgs are among the most luminous , rapidly star - forming galaxies known , with luminosities greater than 10@xmath11 @xmath12 and star formation rates of @xmath13 @xmath14  yr@xmath15 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that the mass - size distribution and the mean stellar mass surface density of these two classes of high - redshift galaxies are similar .",
    "both types are best fit by low srsic indices ( @xmath4 ) . moreover , from a co study of 30 local merger remnants , ueda et al .",
    "( 2014 ) find that the majority of the sources exhibit kinematic signatures of rotating molecular gas disks .",
    "furthermore , @xcite conclude that more than 95% of smgs have pure stellar disks or disk - dominated stellar structures ; the distribution of axial ratios ( their figure 6 ) rejects the possibility that the sample is bulge - dominated .    the above arguments strongly suggest that high-@xmath5 massive galaxies should host large - scale stellar disks .",
    "this hypothesis is attested by a number of studies . from the work of van der wel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , 50% of massive galaxies at _ z _ @xmath1 2 are disk - dominated .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that massive galaxies at _ z _ @xmath1 1 have higher axial ratios than their lower redshift counterparts , broadly consistent with the tendency for galaxies to become noticeably rounder between @xmath16 and 0 @xcite .",
    "now the question remains : how have the red nuggets , which most likely contained a significant disk component at @xmath0 @xmath3 2 turn , into local giant ellipticals like m87 , which demonstrably do _ not _ have a disk ?",
    "we aim to trace this morphological transition .",
    "we do so by performing detailed two - dimensional modeling of the optical light distribution of massive galaxies within 0.5 @xmath17 @xmath0 @xmath17 2.5 .",
    "besides fitting a traditional , simple single - component srsic function , when possible , we perform a bulge+disk decomposition of these massive systems . examining separately the bulge and disk structural properties , plus",
    "the luminosity bulge - to - total ratio ( @xmath6 ) , provides key indicators that can be missed by studying potentially multiple - component galaxies as a single system .",
    "for instance , from the comprehensive morphological analysis by @xcite , massive galaxies appear to transit from disk - dominated to bulge - dominated between @xmath18 and 1 , with elliptical - like systems emerge at lower redshifts . the bulge+disk decomposition carried out by bruce et al .",
    "was done by fixing the srsic index of the bulge to @xmath19 and of the disk to @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "all bulges were assymed to follow a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) light profile .",
    "the simulations of davari et al .",
    "( 2016 ) show that this method can lead to biases in measuring the properties of the bulge and disk , depending on the size , @xmath21 , and redshift of the galaxy .",
    "for instance , fixing bulge @xmath4 can overestimate / underestimate the bulge / disk total brightness , and in general , the uncertainties tend to be greater when the bulge @xmath4 is fixed . besides , by fixing the bulge srsic index , one can not tell how the bulge density and shape evolve , and important information is lost .",
    "our study relaxes the restriction on the bulge profile shape , which results in more robust and informative bulge+disk decompositions ( davari et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels;@xcite ; @xcite ) , provides an unprecedented chance to investidagate the morphological evolution of galaxies .",
    "in fact , one of the original science goals of candels is to trace the bulge and disk growth in rest - frame optical wavelengths at 1 @xmath17 @xmath5 @xmath17 3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we take advantage of all wide and deep images taken in five well - known , widely separated fields : goods - south and goods - north ( the great observatories origins deep survey ; @xcite ) , uds ( ukidss ultra - deep survey ; @xcite ) , cosmos ( the cosmic evolution survey ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and egs ( the extended groth strip ; @xcite ) .",
    "these collectively yield a statistically uniform and robust sample that mitigates cosmic variance .",
    "the most massive galaxies in the local universe are almost all quiscent ( @xcite ) , which is not the case at earlier epochs ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that massive star - forming galaxies have all quenched over time . quantifying the evolution of both quiescent and star - forming galaxies helps trace back the formation of massive ellipticals and understand the bigger picture .",
    "we address three key questions :    \\1 ) how does the size and the shape of the light distribution ( srsic index ) of star - forming and quiescent massive galaxies evolve ?",
    "\\2 ) do high - redshift massive galaxies have a prominent stellar disk ?",
    "if yes , do their relative bulge fraction evolve significantly over the last 10 billion years ?",
    "\\3 ) what does the observed evolution of bulges and disks teach us about the history of massive galaxies ?",
    "our findings show that the massive galaxies were compact and indeed more disk - dominated at higher redshifts and became more bulge - dominated over time , converging to the population of massive ellipticals by today .",
    "only major mergers can effectively destroy large - scale disks .",
    "thus , while minor mergers were largely responsible for the significant size increase of high-_z _ galaxies , our results underscore that major mergers also played an important role in the morphological transformation of massive galaxies .",

    "the photometric redshifts are computed by combining 11 independent measurements ( @xcite ) , each using different combinations of photometric redshift code , template spectral energy distributions , and priors .",
    "the median fraction difference between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is less than 0.01 , with an rms scatter of @xmath26 ( @xcite ) . as this study is mostly concerned with broad evolutionary trends between @xmath0 @xmath3 2.5 to 0.5 , precise redshifts for individual objects are not essential to our analysis .",
    "the final quoted stellar mass is the median of estimates from 10 different candels teams , who used the same photometry and redshifts estimates but different fitting codes , assumptions , priors , and parameter grid ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for massive galaxies ,",

    ", however , the presence of a sizable bulge concentration severely dilutes the expected ellipticity signature of any disk component . indeed , neither the anova nor the ks test indicates any statistically significant redshift evolution of @xmath52 .",
    "( table 2 ) .",
    "however , considering only the quiescent galaxies at @xmath5 @xmath1 1.5 and @xmath5 @xmath17 1.5 , there are two suggestive indicators of ellipticity evolutions .",
    "first , f - test of equality of variances gives a p - value of 0.08 which is a bordering signature of greater range ( variance ) of ellipticities at @xmath5 @xmath1 1.5 .",
    "second , comparing ellipticities of the quiescent galaxies at @xmath5 @xmath1 1.5 and @xmath5 @xmath17 1.5 shows a tentative drop in the overall ellipticity : the two sample one - sided t - test gives a p - value of  0.05 .",
    "these signatures are suggestive and not conclusive .",
    "the following section presents a more detailed analysis which provides an independent gauge for the presence of a disk among massive quiescent galaxies at higher redshifts .    to summarize the results and implications of the single - component",
    "fits : the global light distribution of the massive galaxy population evolves significantly from @xmath42 to @xmath69 .",
    "apart from the well - known increase in size , the population as a whole , and in particular the quiescent systems , exhibits systematical evolution toward larger srsic indices and lower ellipticities at lower redshifts , converging to typical values of local ellipticals .",
    "these trends support the thesis that the progenitors of present - day ellipticals were born with a sizable large - scale disk , which over time has been transformed .      while single srsic fitting provides a reliable first - order estimate of morphological properties , decomposing a galaxy into its bulge and disk components can reveal a new set of valuable galaxy evolution indicators .",
    "the simulations of davari et al .",
    "( 2016 ) show that gross photometric properties , in particular @xmath6 , of bulge+disk systems usually can be measured accurately , up to @xmath73 , without imposing any constraints on the profile shape of the bulge . however , due to the inherent limitations of resolution , even with _ hst _ , detailed properties of the bulges ( e.g. , @xmath47 or @xmath4 ) can be measured reliable only for galaxies with @xmath6 @xmath74 0.2 .",
    "the disk component , by contrast , can be measured with little difficulty .",
    "figure [ fig : bt ] depicts the overall variation of @xmath6 with redshift for our sample . at higher redshifts ,",
    "quiescent galaxies have intermediate values of @xmath6 ( @xmath20.4 ) , but over time they become more and more bulge - dominated . at the lowest redshift bin , @xmath75 , very close to the median value of local massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "although star - forming galaxies , too , become more bulge - dominated with time , their @xmath6 at all redshift bins are lower than that of their quiescent counterparts ; the two classes have statistically different distributions in @xmath6 ( table 4 ) .",
    "@xcite report that massive galaxies at @xmath76 are mostly disk - dominated and by @xmath77 have increased their @xmath6 to intermediate values , with very few elliptical - like galaxies down to @xmath78 .",
    "they show that disk - dominated galaxies have higher star formation rates , which translates into star - forming galaxies having a lower @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , @xcite also find that massive galaxies increase in @xmath6 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "although @xmath27-band images of galaxies at different redshifts capture the flux in different rest - frame bands ( i.e. , approximately @xmath29 to @xmath81 band ) , multi - wavelength studies of nearby galaxies find that @xmath6 does not strongly depend on observed rest - frame wavelength , at least within the standard optical bands ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed variation of @xmath6 between different bands is less than @xmath82 .",
    "the shallow color gradients of quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , wirth 1981 ) further minimizes the impact of rest - frame wavelength on @xmath6 .",
    "while the bulges of both types of galaxies become more luminous over time , the disks component behaves markedly differently : it becomes sub - dominant in quiescent galaxies but brightens for the star - forming group ( middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig : bt ] ; table 4 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the star - forming galaxies disks are becoming brighter at lower redshift bins .",
    "the bulges of quiescent galaxies attain higher luminosities than in star - forming galaxies at all redshifts , and in the lowest redshift bin the luminosities of quiescent galaxies have significantly smaller scatter than in star - forming galaxies .",
    "our bulge+disk decomposition ( figure [ fig : bulge ] and table 3 ) reinforces the size evolution observed in the single - component fits ( figure [ fig : singlesersic ] ) .",
    "the effective radii of the bulges of both classes have grown , and , once more , the evolution is steeper for quiescent galaxies .",
    "the disk scale lengths of both star - forming and quiescent galaxies have increased ( figure [ fig : disk ] ) as well , but their distributions are not distinguishable ( table 4 )",
    ". table 3 indicates that the disk size increase is less significant compared to the bulge component .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : bulge ] , the srsic indices of quiescent galaxy bulges have increased considerably but have stayed almost the same for the star - forming population . this is similar to the results of single - component analysis ( figure [ fig : singlesersic ] ) . by redshift 0.5 ,",
    "bulges of quiescent galaxies have srsic indices similar to that of typical local ellipticals and classical bulges ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disk ellipticities of both classes have similar distribution and have not changed between _ z _ = 2.5 and 0.5 . on the other hand , the bulges of massive galaxies have become rounder over this period .",
    "quiescent galaxies have lower bulge ellipticities , and by _ z _ = 0.5 , their distribution is similar to that of local massive ellipticals and classical bulges ( @xcite ) .    in related studies ,",
    "bruce et al . ( 2014a , 2014b ) analyze the rest - frame optical morphologies of a mass - selected sample of massive ( @xmath83 ) galaxies at @xmath84 in the candels uds and cosmos fields .",
    "similar to our work , they decomposed @xmath85-band images of massive galaxies into their bulge and disk components . in general ,",
    "our results are in agreement with those of these authors .",
    "bruce et al . ( 2014a ) find that from @xmath5 = 3 to @xmath5 = 1 the galaxies transition from disk - dominated to more bulge - dominated ( their figure 6 ) , in accordance with our findings ( our figure 6 ) .",
    "the results of bruce et al .",
    "( 2014b ) show that bulges exhibit a stronger size evolution than disks ( their table 3 ) , with star - forming galaxies having relatively larger disk sizes compared to passive systems ( their figure 8) , in qualitative agreement with our results ( compare with our table 3 and figure 8) . however , with regards to the the bulge components , they show that star - forming galaxies have larger bulges than quiescent galaxies , contrary to the results from our study",
    ". this may be due to the fact that the bulge - disk decomposition of bruce et al .",
    "( 2014a , 2014b ) was done by fixing the srsic index of the bulge and disk components to 4 and 1 , respectively .",
    "as demonstrated in davari et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , fixing the srsic indices can lead to biases and larger uncertainties in measuring bulge and disk properties , depending on their size , redshift , and @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , assuming a fixed profile for disks and bulges at all redshifts precludes any investigation of the evolution of these parameters with look - back time .",
    "despite the prevalence of spiral structures and bars in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , these features are not believed to be common among star - forming galaxies at higher redshifts ( _ z _ @xmath1 1.5 ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , where the disks may be too dynamically hot ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our model - subtracted residual images yield an unexpected surprise : a sizable fraction of the sources exhibit spiral structure ( figure [ fig : spiral_images ] ) .",
    "all the cases are star - forming galaxies ; there are no quiescent galaxies with securely detectable spiral structure ( table 5 ) . the case",
    "with the highest redshift is at @xmath86 .",
    "the fraction of star - forming galaxies with spiral structure is @xmath87% at @xmath88 , and by @xmath89 , the spiral fraction reaches nearly 70% .",
    "the fraction of star - forming galaxies with spiral structures drops ( to 30% ) at the lowest redshift bin .",
    "this decline may not be reliable for two reasons .",
    "first , the star - forming sample size at @xmath90 is very small ( only 10 objects ) , and therefore the sample proportions are not statistically significant .",
    "second , the @xmath27-band images for the low-@xmath5 objects are missing the bluer parts of the galaxy flux ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the conditions necessary for the formation of spiral arms are complex ( see @xcite for a review ) , but one requirement is clear  the existence of a disk .",
    "thus , from the point of view of one of the main themes of this paper , the clear detection of spiral features in high-@xmath5 massive galaxies constitutes arguably the strongest , most model - independent evidence for the presence of a substantial disk component in these systems .",
    "we see the spiral features only in the star - forming galaxies and not in quiescent systems , but , by analogy with local s0 and spiral galaxies , this is not surprising .",
    "an edge - on view of a galaxy can reveal another indisputable signature of a prominent stellar disk .",
    "figure [ fig : thindisk ] gives several examples of highly flattened ( @xmath91 ) galaxies in our sample that are consistent with disk structures seen edge - on .",
    "interestingly , most of them are relatively thick",
    ". the fraction of galaxies with a stellar disk can be infered from the frequency of detected edge - on galaxies . for this estimation , we assume a uniform distribution of ellipticity with @xmath92 for a population of bulge+disk systems .",
    "the inferred fraction of galaxies with a disk hovers around 4050% at @xmath93 , both among star - forming and quiescent galaxies , but below @xmath78 , the incidence of edge - on quiescent galaxies drops to zero ( table 5 ) . highly flattened systems ( especially at high-_z _ ) can be hallmarks of merger .",
    "however , considering the fact that the majority of these galaxies are compact , the chance of this degeneracy is low .",
    "the discovery of red nuggets has captured much attention in recent years as it requires a new paradigm for the formation and evolution of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "the observed compactness of red nuggets at @xmath94 initially raised the question of whether the massive red galaxies have indeed increased their sizes by a factor of roughly @xmath95 while maintaining their passive state , or whether the size measurement might in some way be flawed .",
    "extensive recent simulations ( @xcite ; davari et al .",
    "2014 , 2016 ) , coupled with consistent results from multiple independent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , have minimized skepticism on the fidelity of the size measurements .",
    "this work confirms that massive galaxies at @xmath96 were indeed compact , and over the next 10 billion years their sizes have increased significantly ( figure [ fig : singlesersic ] ) .",
    "the growth occurred inside - out ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : inside_out ] shows the median light distribution of massive quiescent and star - forming galaxies in four redshift bins . while the inner few kpc of these galaxies have been in place since @xmath28 , over time more and more material was added to their outskirts .",
    "accretion onto quiescent galaxies continued at least down to @xmath97 , whereas their star - forming counterparts seem to have stopped growing by @xmath98 .",
    "the compactness of the red massive galaxies at higher redshifts and their similarities to smgs implicate the importance of strong gas dissipation during their early formation epochs , which in turn led to the starburst activity and accompanying disk formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this raises some important questions : do red nuggets at @xmath96 have a sizable disk component , and if so , how prevalent was it ? and since red nuggets are widely believed to evolve into present - day elllipticals  indeed , our number density selection was specifically chosen to ensure that they do  can we trace the redshift evolution of the morphological transformation that must take place ?",
    "table 5 shows the estimated fraction of galaxies with a prominent stellar disk , using three different diagnostics : galaxies with @xmath6 @xmath17 0.5 , visually detectable spiral features ( section 4.3 ) , and inferences from the frequency of detected edge - on ( @xmath91 ; section 4.3 ) systems .",
    "our results suggest that disks may be common among high-_z _ massive galaxies , although it is difficult to obtain a conclusive estimate of their frequency .",
    "they range from an absolute minimum of @xmath99% , as deduced from the incidence of spiral arms among star - forming systems , to as high as @xmath100% for all massive galaxies regardless of star formation activity , according to bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "the three disk diagnostics are not equally reliable and informative . while , visually detectable spiral structures are the most reliable indicator of a disk , they provide the lower limit , as the viewing angle and surface brightness dimming can prevent the detection of these structures .",
    "furthermore , at higher redshifts , disks of massive galaxies may not be favorable to long lived spiral structures .",
    "on the other hand , low @xmath6 at higher redshifts does not necessarily mean a disk resides in a galaxy and provides an upper limit .",
    "the fitted exponential component is not necessarily an indicator of a disk .",
    "lastly , the inferred fraction of disks using the fraction of edge - on disks is probably the best proxy for the detection of disks .",
    "the prevalence of large - scale disks at @xmath101 is further reinforced by the moderate srsic indices and broad distribution of ellipticities derived from the global light distribution , a trend already echoed in other recent investigations . by tracking the population from @xmath28 to 0.5 and performing a consistent analysis of the whole sample",
    ", we witness the gradual transition of the large - scale morphology . by @xmath97",
    ", the red massive galaxies attain a high bulge fraction of @xmath75 , signifying the near disappearance of a dominant disk ( figure [ fig : bt ] ) ; their global ( figure [ fig : singlesersic ] and bulge ( figure [ fig : bulge ] ) srsic indices converge to @xmath102 , values close to that of de vaucouleurs profile ; and their global axial ratios drop to values closely resembling those of local massive galaxies ( e.g. , as measured in the gama survey ) .",
    "all of these indicators strongly support the thesis that high-@xmath5 red nuggets are , in fact , the direct ancestors of today s massive ellipticals .",
    "much attention has been focused recently on the pivotal role that minor , dry mergers play in the evolution of red nuggets into present - day elliptical galaxies .",
    "minor mergers are considered the most plausible mechanism for explaining the dramatic size growth of massive quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , their mass increase after being quenched ( @xcite ) , the multiple - component structure of local ellipticals ( huang et al .",
    "2013a , 2013b ) , and the prevalence of tidal features seen in deep imaging of nearby massive galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations of @xcite stress the effectiveness of dry mergers in increasing the sizes of massive compact galaxies .",
    "consistent with @xcite , they find that dry mergers lead to a size - mass relation of the form @xmath47",
    "@xmath103 @xmath104 , with @xmath105 @xmath3 2 .",
    "this is close to the size evolution we measure , @xmath106 , for our quiescent massive galaxies between redshift 2.5 and 0.5 .",
    "interestingly , star - forming galaxies have a considerably smaller value of @xmath107 .",
    "by @xmath108 , more than 80% of the simulated massive galaxies ( @xmath83 ) from @xcite have experienced minor mergers .",
    "the merger rate is expected , on average , to increase monotonically with stellar mass ( @xcite ) , and therefore should be even higher for our sample .",
    "figure [ fig : merger_images ] shows a number of galaxies from our sample with disturbed morphologies and small - scale structure that may be indicative of merging activity .",
    "we estimate , from visual inspection , that at @xmath109 more than 60% of quiescent galaxies have small nearby objects or show merger signatures ( e.g. , distortions , tidal tails , and shells ) ; about 40% of star - forming galaxies show similar features .",
    "by @xmath89 , the fraction of merger candidates , for both classes combined , drops to @xmath110% , presumably because it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve small - scale structure for distant galaxies .",
    "while these morphological indicators are by no means secure estimators of the merger fraction , they at least give the qualitative impression that mergers  especially minor mergers ",
    "play a part in the morphological transformation of massive galaxies .",
    "the discovery of a significant disk component in massive galaxies at @xmath96 and their eventual disappearance toward lower redshifts brings an important new element to the story .",
    "how were the disks destroyed ? can this be accomplished by minor mergers alone ?",
    "most likely not . breaking a big disk requires hitting it with something hefty , which can only be accomplished with a major merger .",
    "the simulations of @xcite show that major mergers are needed for forming galaxies with high @xmath6 .",
    "another key player in the evolutionary scenario of massive galaxies is , one that has captured less attention , are the compact blue galaxies although star - forming galaxies are larger than quiescent galaxies at each redshift bin , at high redshifts these galaxies are compact , as well ( figure [ fig : singlesersic ] ) .",
    "as local star - forming massive galaxies are rare ( e.g. , @xcite ) , most of high - redshift compact blue galaxies must have also evolved into present - day massive ellipticals .",
    "figure [ fig : class_fraction ] illustrates how over time the star - forming massive galaxies turn into quiescent massive galaxies . at the same time that the blue population quenches star formation , significant morphological transformation must also occur to elevate the relative bulge fraction ( figure [ fig : bt ] ) and increase the srsic index ( both globally and for the bulge alone ; figure [ fig : singlesersic ] and [ fig : bulge ] ) .",
    "the prevalence of prominent stellar disks at higher redshifts raises the possibility that some of these bulge+disk massive galaxies may have survived to the present . where are they ?",
