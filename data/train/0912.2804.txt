    "young stellar objects ( ysos ) and their immediate surroundings are expected to evolve significantly throughout star formation .",
    "for example , ysos will evolve in luminosity and temperature , as their masses grow and they evolve toward the main sequence ( e.g. , myers et al .",
    "in addition , the associated gas will evolve dynamically . as collapse proceeds gas flows from cores through disks and onto protostars , driving jets and outflows in the process .",
    "these outflows are a crucial mechanism by which angular momentum is removed from a star forming system where accretion occurs through a rotating disk .",
    "therefore , an outflow is a good tracer of star formation , especially when the central protostar is deeply embedded .",

    "figure 1a shows a three - color image comprised of irac 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 @xmath8 m   images . the dominant feature in the image is a jet extending about 10 .",
    "the extended blue color emission perpendicular to the jet is consistent with the distribution of the millimeter dust continuum emission ( see upper panel of figure 1b ) , so it is likely dominated by scattered light within a dense cloud with some contribution from shocked gas associated with jets and outflows .",
    "there is also a small bipolar nebula structure , similar to that seen in core e of l1251 ( l1251b , lee et al .",

    "m , the two infrared sources become brighter ( see upper panel of figure 1b ) . in addition , as seen in figure 1b , these sources are each located at both 350 @xmath8 m  and 1.2 mm dust continuum peaks , indicating they are likely very embedded objects . in l1251-a",
    "the c2d team identified 4 ysos , marked as irs1 , irs2 , irs3 , and irs4 in figure 1b .",
    "the infrared source between irs3 and irs4 is classified as a galaxy based on the c2d criteria ( evans et al .",
    "table 1 lists fluxes of the four ysos at various wavelengths , and the sed of the yso associated with the jet ( irs3 ) is shown in figure 2 ( as red diamonds ) .",
    "the sed clearly indicates that irs3 has a very thick envelope with strong ( sub)millimeter emission .",
    "irs4 is associated with the bipolar nebula and shows a similar sed to that of irs3 , although it is not presented in this paper .",
    "figure 1b ( lower panel ) shows the co 2@xmath91 outflow map on top of the irac 4.5 @xmath8 m  image .",
    "the outflow map covers the whole jet feature as well as the bipolar nebula . along the jet , it shows two distinct lobes with little overlap , suggesting a large inclination of rotational axis with respective to the line of sight .",
    "the outflow lobes are well correlated spatially with the infrared jet .",
    "no clear outflow structure is seen towards irs4 and its associated bipolar nebula , although some weak red - shifted emission is present .",
    "the jet feature associated with irs3 appears consistently in all irac bands , indicating that the jet emission is probably produced by a common gas component such as molecular hydrogen , which has its line transitions distributed over all irac bands .",
    "therefore , we calculate the irac colors of [ 5.6 @xmath8m]/[8.0 @xmath8 m ] and [ 4.5 @xmath8m]/[8.0 @xmath8 m ] to compare with those of thermal gas modeled to explain the molecular hydrogen emission from the jet ( figure 3 ) . the colors were calculated in 4 pixel ( @xmath12 ) radius apertures at the positions marked with @xmath13 circles in figure 2 . in the model calculation of the colors ( figure 3 ) , the molecular gas was assumed to be composed of h@xmath14 and he , with @xmath15 .",
    "we calculated the level population of h@xmath4 gas in statistical equilibrium .",
    "the collisional coefficients were obtained from le bourlot et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and an ortho - to - para ratio of 3.0 is assumed .",
    "the temperature of the shocked h@xmath14 gas was modeled in two ways : isothermal and power - law admixed . in the latter ,",
    "the infinitesimal h@xmath14 column density has a power - law relation with the temperature @xmath16 , d@xmath17 , in the range of @xmath18 k. more detailed descriptions can be found in neufeld & yuan ( 2008 ) and shinn et al .",
    "( 2009a , b ) .    we know that this jet is located inside a molecular cloud ( sato et al . 1994 ) ,",
    "thus , the extinction close to the jet engine is possibly much higher than 0.5 mag , which is the interstellar extinction toward l1251-a ( kun & prusti 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , the expected colors are extinction corrected with a@xmath19 mag , which is obtained from the 1.2 mm dust continuum emission at 0.1 pc from irs3 , following the  milky way , @xmath20 \" curve ( weingartner & draine 2001 , draine 2003 ) .",
    "extinction corrected colors with a@xmath21 and 5 mag are not different .",
    "however , close to ysos ( c and e in figure 1a ) , a@xmath22 mag .",
    "we tested this high extinction only for the colors of c and e , which move diagonally up and right in the color - color diagram .    according to the comparison between the observed and modeled colors along the jet ,",
    "the irac colors can be explained with the power - law admixture model , as neufeld & yuan ( 2008 ) and shinn et al .",
    "( 2009a , b ) found .",
    "all colors are located between the model of @xmath23 @xmath24 and the lte line , where the pre - shock density must be higher than @xmath25 @xmath24 ( wilgenbus et al .",
    ". there might be some contribution from other emission components not considered in our model , such as the co @xmath26 transitions in irac 2 .",
    "however , such contamination is not likely according to neufeld & yuan ( 2008 ) . the power - law index , @xmath27 is the smallest ( @xmath28 ) at the jet feature close to the central embedded source ( c in figure 1a ) and the bipolar nebula feature ( e in figure 1a ) in the east of the long jet , indicating that there are more hot components close to the embedded ysos .",
    "alternatively , the scattered light in the outflow cavity may enhance the colors ( more scattered light at shorter wavelengths ) .",
    "if we apply a@xmath29 mag , the colors at c and e become similar to those of the model with b@xmath6 . except for these two points ,",
    "@xmath27 is between @xmath30 , consistent with results of neufeld & yuan ( 2008 ) , who showed that this range of @xmath27 values can be explained by the paraboloidal bow shock model .",
    "bow shocks can be considered as a geometrical summation of planar c - shocks , whose postshock temperature is nearly isothermal ( neufeld et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this sense ,",
    "neufeld & yuan ( 2008 ) showed that a single bow shock generates a shocked h@xmath4 gas with b@xmath31 , and @xmath27 can be higher than 3.8 when slow bow shocks , where h@xmath4 is not dissociated even at the apex , are mixed with fast bow shocks .",
    "following young et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , bourke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and dunham et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we modeled the sed of the yso associated with the jet ( irs3 ) using the 1-d dust continuum radiative transfer code dusty ( ivezic et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in addition to a central stellar object , a 1-d disk model ( butner et al .",
    "1994 ) was adopted with a surface density profile of @xmath32 and temperature profile of @xmath33 to calculate the internal input sed for the best - fit model .",
    "the envelope is assumed to have a power - law density profile and is heated by the interstellar radiation field attenuated by a@xmath34=3 mag . for the dust opacity",
    ", we adopt the same dust model used by crapsi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) : a mixture of carbon ( 29% of the total dust mass ) and silicate grains covered with various molecular ices . for a detailed explanation of the modeling procedure see young & evans ( 2005 ) and dunham et al .",
    "the best - fit sed to the observed fluxes is presented in figure 2 .",
    "the best - fit model has an internal luminosity of @xmath35  with @xmath36 k. this internal luminosity derived by the model , which is considered to be the true bolometric luminosity of the source , is greater than  calculated from observed fluxes because some of these long - wavelength fluxes were measured with apertures smaller than the total extent of the source .",
    "the envelope of the model has a power - law density profile index of @xmath37 , a mass of @xmath38 , and inner and outer radii of 250 and 18,000 au , respectively .",
    "the internal luminosity derived by the model can be considered the current accretion luminosity .",
    "the average accretion luminosity over the yso lifetime can be derived from the momentum flux in the outflow .",
    "we use the co j@xmath39 map to calculate the outflow momentum flux , @xmath40 , following the method presented by hatchell et al .",
    "this quantity is the average rate at which momentum is injected into the outflow , and we calculate @xmath41 @xmath42   yr@xmath11 and list this result in table 2 .",
    "there is an inclination dependence that we leave in the result since the source inclination is not known .",
    "two additional unknowns in the above calculation are the optical depth and the temperature of the outflowing gas ( needed to convert line intensity to column density assuming lte ) .",
    "following m. dunham et al .",
    "( 2009 , in prep ) , we assume the gas is optically thin and has a temperature of @xmath43 k , which minimizes the line intensity to column density conversion . optically thick gas and any other temperature in the range of @xmath44 k will increase @xmath40 , thus the above result is a very strong lower limit to the true value .",
    "since molecular outflows are driven by the transfer of momentum from a jet / wind ejected by the protostellar system to the ambient medium and the jet / wind ejection process is closely tied to accretion onto the protostar , the calculated @xmath40 , which represents the average rate at which momentum is injected into the outflow , is related to @xmath45 , the time - averaged protostellar mass accretion rate ( see bontemps et al .",
    "1996 ) :    @xmath46    in the above equation , @xmath47 is the mass - loss rate in the jet / wind , @xmath48 is the velocity of the jet / wind , and @xmath49 is the entrainment efficiency between the jet / wind and the ambient gas . with typical values for the above parameters of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ( bontemps et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) , we calculate @xmath53   yr@xmath11 . an outflow dynamical time",
    "( @xmath54 yr ) is calculated by dividing the extent of the outflow ( @xmath55 ) by the outflow velocity ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "assuming accretion at the above rate for this length of time gives an accreted protostellar mass of @xmath57 . finally , accretion at the above rate onto a protostar with this mass and @xmath58  gives a spherical accretion luminosity of @xmath59 .",
    "we calculated the bolometric luminosity and temperature of each yso identified in l1251-a , following the method used in dunham et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the apparent drivers ( irs3 and irs4 ) of the infrared jet and bipolar nebula have  @xmath60 @xmath61 , similar to irs2 in l1251b ( l1251b - irs2 ) , another source associated with infrared bipolar structure ( lee et al .",
    "2006 ) . although irs3 and irs4 are @xmath62 times fainter than l1251b - irs2 at 24 @xmath8 m , they are very bright at wavelengths longer than 70 @xmath8 m .",
    "their bolometric temperatures are @xmath6320 k , much lower than that of l1251b - irs2 ( 140 k ) . finally , the ratio of @xmath64 for irs3 and irs4 ( @xmath630.13 and 0.17 , respectively , where @xmath65 is the luminosity at @xmath66 @xmath8 m ) is much greater than that of l1251b - irs2 ( @xmath630.03 ) , indicative of class 0 sources with very thick envelopes .",
    "the dominant feature in l1251-a is the long , well - collimated jet associated with irs3 .",
    "this type of jet structure can be produced in the irac bands by ro - vibrational or pure rotational line emission of h@xmath4 in a pulsating jet with little precession ( model a1 in smith & rosen 2005 ) . according to smith & rosen ( 2005 ) , this jet model ( a1 ) transfers the bulk kinetic energy to large distances but excites h@xmath4 with the lowest efficiency .",
    "however , the jet shows undulating structure toward both ends .",
    "smith & rosen ( 2005 ) showed this kind of helical stream in a jet with a slow uniform - speed precession .",
    "therefore , the jet in l1251-a might be explained with a small precession angle ( but greater than that of a1 ) and a long pulsating period ( much longer than 60 years ) .",
    "in fact , the jet associated with the northern , red component of the co outflow features two distinct emission bulks , indicative of episodic ejection . the time interval between episodes of ejection",
    "is @xmath67 years if we assume a jet speed of 150 .    the infrared jet and the co outflow are well correlated in shape and length as seen in figure 1b . from the co @xmath68 map",
    ", we calculated a time - averaged mass accretion rate and the accretion luminosity expected from accretion at this rate ( table 2 ) . in spite of uncertainties in @xmath49 and @xmath69 , the calculated time - averaged accretion rate ( and resulting accretion luminosity ) are strong lower limits , as explained in  4 .",
    "in addition , a large inclination ( there is little overlap between red and blue components of the co outflow and no significant intensity difference between two infrared jet lobes ) of 70  will give @xmath70 , which is much greater than @xmath71 derived from dust modeling ( 0.9 ) . since the luminosity from dust modeling depends on the _ current _ mass accretion rate , this rate must be lower now than the time - averaged value over the outflow lifetime .",
    "the comparison between the observed irac colors and the ones from the model of a power - law admixture of gas ( see figure 3 ) indicates the amount of hot components varies ( in general , more hot gas closer to the jet engine ) .",
    "if we use the same colors ( [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] vs. [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] ) as those presented by ybarra & lada ( 2009 ) , who modeled only the hot ( 2000@xmath94000 k ) gas component , c and e ( @xmath72 , see figure 3 ) are located at @xmath73 @xmath24 , while n2 , n3 , and s ( @xmath74 ) lie close to the model line of @xmath75 @xmath24 . therefore the density inferred by their model is not very different from that inferred from our model , although , unlike in our model , ybarra & lada ( 2009 ) included collisions between h@xmath4 and h. however , n1 is placed at @xmath76 @xmath24 in their model , consistent with our model result since the model of ybarra & lada ( 2009 ) considered only the hot gas component , and in our model , @xmath77 for n1 suggests a relatively small amount of hot gas at that position .",

    "<S> in addition , the variation of the power - law index along the jet suggests that the portion of hot gas decreases with distance from the jet engine . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular outflow in this region has been mapped for the first time using co data . from the calculated outflow momentum flux , a very strong lower limit to the average accretion luminosity </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath3 , indicative of a decrease in the accretion rate with time . </S>"
