    "polynomial residue codes are a large class of linear codes .",
    "some well - known codes , such as bch codes , reed - solomon codes and goppa codes @xcite , can be derived from polynomial residue codes .",
    "a polynomial residue code with moduli @xmath0 encodes a message @xmath1 as the vector @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is called a codeword ( or residue vector ) , and @xmath4 are residues of @xmath1 modulo @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "the hamming weight of a codeword in a polynomial residue code is the number of residues that are nonzero , the hamming distance between two codewords is the number of residues in which they differ , and a polynomial residue code with the minimum hamming distance @xmath7 can correct up to @xmath8 errors in the residues , where @xmath9 denotes the floor function . in general , polynomial residue codes can be classified into two categories : codes with pairwise coprime moduli @xcite and codes with non - pairwise coprime moduli @xcite . in a polynomial residue code with pairwise",
    "coprime moduli @xmath10 , codewords are residue vectors of all polynomials with degrees less than that of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and the first @xmath13 moduli form a set of nonredundant moduli , while the last @xmath14 moduli form a set of redundant moduli that facilitates residue error correction . in a polynomial residue code with non - pairwise coprime moduli @xmath0 , codewords are residue vectors of all polynomials with degrees less than that of the least common multiple ( lcm ) of all the moduli .",
    "compared with a polynomial residue code with pairwise coprime moduli , a polynomial residue code with non - pairwise coprime moduli has more efficient distributed error decoding and simpler error correction algorithm at the cost of an increase in redundancy . over the past few decades , polynomial residue codes have been extensively investigated due to their ability of fault - tolerance in polynomial - type computing required for signal processing tasks such as cyclic convolution and fft computations @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , there is also a great amount of work on integer residue codes @xcite .",
    "recently , different from the hamming distance , another type of distance called degree - weighted distance for polynomial residue codes is defined , and accordingly , a coding framework based on the degree - weighted distance has been developed for polynomial residue codes with pairwise coprime moduli in @xcite . in this paper , with regard to this degree - weighted distance , we naturally study polynomial residue codes with non - pairwise coprime moduli .",
    "we derive the error correction capabilities of these codes and also propose the minimum degree - weighted distance decoding algorithm .",
    "moreover , we give two simple examples to show that for the two types of minimum distance decoders for polynomial residue codes with non - pairwise coprime moduli ( i.e. , the minimum hamming distance decoding proposed in @xcite and the minimum degree - weighted distance decoding proposed in this paper ) , one is not absolutely stronger than the other , but they can complement each other from different points of view .    _ notations _ : define by @xmath15 $ ] the set of all polynomials with coefficients in @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an indeterminate and @xmath16 is a field .",

    "all the elements of @xmath16 are termed scalars and can be expressed as polynomials of degree @xmath20 .",
    "a polynomial is called monic if the coefficient of the highest power of @xmath17 is @xmath21 , and irreducible if it has only a scalar and itself as its factors .",
    "the residue of @xmath18 modulo @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath23 . for a polynomial set @xmath24",
    ", we define @xmath25 , and denote the cardinality of @xmath26 , the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) and lcm of all the polynomials in @xmath26 by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . both @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "are taken to be monic for the uniqueness .",
    "two polynomials are said to be coprime if their @xmath32 is @xmath21 . throughout the paper , all polynomials considered are in @xmath15",
    "$ ] , and @xmath9 and @xmath33 stand for the floor and ceiling functions .",
    "let @xmath34 be a set of @xmath35 non - pairwise coprime moduli , and @xmath36 be the lcm of all the moduli , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "we can represent a polynomial @xmath1 with @xmath38 by its residue vector @xmath2 , where @xmath39 or @xmath40 , i.e. , there exists @xmath41 such that @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "define a set of @xmath35 pairwise coprime monic polynomials @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 divides @xmath5 for each @xmath47 .",
    "then , @xmath1 can be uniquely reconstructed from its residue vector via the generalized chinese remainder theorem ( crt ) for polynomials @xcite as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the modular multiplicative inverse of @xmath51 with respect to @xmath46 , if @xmath52 , else @xmath53 .",
    "note that if moduli @xmath5 are pairwise coprime , we have @xmath54 , and the above ( [ crtpoly ] ) reduces to the standard crt for polynomials .",
    "therefore , polynomials with degrees less than @xmath55 and their residue vectors are isomorphic .",

    "as mentioned before , the redundancy in a polynomial residue code with @xmath35 pairwise coprime moduli is introduced by the @xmath14 redundant moduli , since a message has degree less than that of the product ( or lcm ) of the @xmath13 nonredundant moduli . however , in a polynomial residue code with @xmath35 non - pairwise coprime moduli , the redundancy is introduced by the common factors of all pairs of moduli , since a message has degree less than that of the lcm of all the moduli , and the degree of the lcm of all the moduli is less than that of the product of all the moduli .    according to @xmath40 and @xmath59 , it is not hard to see that @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",

    "so , all pairs of residues in a residue vector @xmath3 are consistent .",
    "if @xmath63 errors with values @xmath64 for @xmath65 have occurred in the transmission , then the received residues will be given by , for @xmath6 , @xmath66 the residue errors @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 . in the following ,",

    "if more than @xmath81 errors have occurred in the residues , the decoding algorithm may fail , i.e. , @xmath89 may not be reconstructed , or even though @xmath1 can be reconstructed as @xmath89 , @xmath90 may not hold .",
    "recently , different from the hamming distance above , a new type of distance called degree - weighted distance for polynomial residue codes is defined , and a coding framework for polynomial residue codes with pairwise coprime moduli has been developed accordingly in @xcite . based on this newly defined degree - weighted distance , we study polynomial residue codes with non - pairwise coprime moduli in the next section of this paper .",
    "in this section , we first obtain the minimum degree - weighted distance of a polynomial residue code with non - pairwise coprime moduli , and then based on this , the decoding algorithm is also proposed .    in a polynomial residue code in definition [ def1 ] , for any @xmath91 , the degree weight of the codeword @xmath2 is defined by @xmath92 and for any @xmath93 , the degree - weighted distance between two codewords @xmath3 and @xmath94 is defined by @xmath95 let @xmath96 denote the minimum degree - weighted distance of the code , which is also the smallest degree weight over all nonzero codewords due to the linearity of the code",

    "then , from @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we have @xmath117 , which is impossible since @xmath91",
    ". we thus have @xmath118 for any nonzero @xmath91 .",
    "we next show that there exists a codeword with exactly the degree weight @xmath119 . without loss of generality , assume that @xmath120 .",
