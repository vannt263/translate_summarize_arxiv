    "the two - dimensional hubbard model is a formidable challenge for theorists .",
    "the dimension is not low enough that an exact solution is available , as in one dimension .",
    "the dimension is not high enough that some mean - field theory , like dynamical mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) , valid in infinite dimension , can come to the rescue . in two dimensions , both quantum and thermal fluctuations are important .",
    "in addition , as we shall see , it turns out that the real materials are in a situation where both potential and kinetic energy are comparable",
    ". we can not begin with the wave picture ( kinetic energy dominated , or so - called weak coupling ) and do perturbation theory , and we can not begin from the particle picture ( potential energy dominated , or so - called strong coupling ) and do perturbation theory . in fact , even if one starts from the wave picture , perturbation theory is not trivial in two dimensions , as we shall see .",
    "variational approaches on the ground state have been proposed,@xcite but even if they capture key aspects of the ground state , they say little about one - particle excitations .    even before the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity , it was suggested that antiferromagnetic fluctuations present in the hubbard model could lead to d - wave superconductivity,@xcite a sort of generalization of the kohn - luttinger mechanism@xcite analogous to the superfluidity mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations in @xmath0he.@xcite nevertheless , early quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations@xcite gave rather discouraging results , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the d - wave pair susceptibility is smaller than the non - interacting one , instead of diverging .",
    "since the observed phenomenon appears at temperatures that are about ten times smaller than what is accessible with qmc , the problem was left open .",
    "detailed analysis of the irreducible vertex@xcite deduced from qmc did suggest the importance of d - wave pairing , but other numerical work@xcite concluded that long - range d - wave order is absent , despite the fact that slave - boson approaches@xcite and many subsequent work suggested otherwise .",
    "the situation on the numerical side is changing since more recent variational,@xcite dynamical cluster approximation@xcite and exact diagonalization@xcite results now point towards the existence of d - wave superconductivity in the hubbard model . even more recently , new numerical approaches are making an even more convincing case.@xcite     and extended @xmath1-wave susceptibilities obtained from qmc simulations for @xmath2 and a @xmath3 lattice .",

    ", we are trying to answer the question , is the hubbard model rich enough to contain the essential physics of the cuprates , both hole and electron doped ? \"",
    "the answer is made possible by new theoretical approaches , increased computing power , and the reassurance that theoretical approaches , numerical and analytical , give consistent results at intermediate coupling even if the starting points are very different .",
    "this paper is a review of the work we have done in sherbrooke on this subject . in the short space provided , this review will not cover all of our work .",
    "needless to say , we will be unfair to the work of many other groups , even though we will try to refer to the work of others that is directly relevant to ours .",
    "we do not wish to make priority claims and we apologize to the authors that may feel unfairly treated .",
    "section [ methodology ] will introduce the methodology : first a method that is valid at weak to intermediate coupling , the two - particle self - consistent approach ( tpsc ) , and then various quantum cluster methods that are better at strong coupling , namely cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) , the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) also known as variational cluster perturbation theory ( vcpt ) , and cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft ) with a brief mention of the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) . in all cases",
    ", we will mention the main comparisons with exact or numerically accurate results that have been used to benchmark the approaches .",
    "in sect .  [ results ] we give some of the results , mostly on the pseudogap and the phase diagram of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "more importantly perhaps , we show the consistency of the results obtained by both weak- and strong - coupling approaches when they are used at intermediate coupling .",
    "finally , we compare with experiment in section [ experiment ] .",
    "we consider the hubbard model@xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are creation and annihilation operators for electrons of spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the density of spin @xmath7 electrons , @xmath9 is the hopping amplitude , and @xmath10 is the on - site coulomb repulsion . in general , we write @xmath11 respectively for the first- , second- and third - nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we first discuss how to approach the problem from the weak coupling perspective and then from the strong coupling point of view . the approaches that we will use in the end are non - perturbative , but in general they are more accurate either at weak or strong coupling .      even at weak coupling",
    ", the hubbard model presents difficulties specific to two dimensions .",
    "the time - honored random phase approximation ( rpa ) has the advantage of satisfying conservation laws , but it violates the pauli principle and the mermin - wagner - hohenberg - coleman ( or mermin - wagner , for short ) theorem .",
    "this theorem states that a continuous symmetry can not be broken at finite temperature in two dimensions .",
    "rpa gives a finite - temperature phase transition .",
    "the pauli principle means , in particular , that @xmath12 in a model with only one orbital per site .",
    "this is violated by rpa since it can be satisfied only if all possible exchanges of electron lines are allowed ( more on this in the following section ) . since the square of the density at a given site is given by @xmath13 , violating the pauli condition @xmath14 will in general lead to large errors in double occupancy , a key quantity in the hubbard model since it is proportional to the potential energy .",
    "another popular approach is the moriya@xcite self - consistent spin - fluctuation approach@xcite that uses a hubbard - stratonovich transformation and a @xmath15 factorization .",
    "this satisfies the mermin - wagner theorem but , unfortunately , violates the pauli principle and introduces an unknown mode - coupling constant as well as an unknown renormalized @xmath10 in the second - order term . the conserving approximation known as fluctuation exchange ( flex )",
    "approximation@xcite is an eliashberg - type theory that is conserving but violates the pauli principle , assumes a migdal theorem and does not reproduce the pseudogap phenomenon observed in qmc .",
    "more detailed criticism of this and other approaches may be found in refs .  . finally , the renormalization group@xcite has the great advantage of being an unbiased method to look for instabilities towards various ordered phases .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to implement in two dimensions because of the proliferation of coupling constants , and , to our knowledge , no one has yet implemented a two - loop calculation without introducing additional approximations.@xcite such a two - loop calculation is necessary to observe the pseudogap phenomenon .      the tpsc approach , originally proposed by vilk , tremblay and collaborators , @xcite aims at capturing non - perturbative effects .",
    "it does not use perturbation theory or , if you want , it drops diagrammatic expansions .",
    "instead , it is based on imposing constraints and sum rules : the theory should satisfy ( a ) the spin and charge conservation laws ( b ) the pauli principle in the form @xmath16 ( c ) the local - moment and the local - density sum rules . without any further explicit constraint , we find that the theory satisfies the mermin - wagner theorem , that it satisfies consistency between one- and two - particle quantities in the sense that @xmath17 and finally that the theory contains the physics of kanamori - brckner screening ( in other words , scattering between electrons and holes includes t - matrix quantum fluctuation effects beyond the born approximation ) .",
    "several derivations of our approach have been given,@xcite including a quite formal one@xcite based on the functional derivative baym - kadanoff approach.@xcite here we only give an outline@xcite of the approach with a more phenomenological outlook .",
    "we proceed in two steps . in the first step ( in our earlier work",
    "sometimes called zeroth step ) , the self - energy is obtained by a hartree - fock - type factorization of the four - point function with the _ additional constraint _ that the factorization is exact when all space - time coordinates coincide . functional differentiation , as in the baym - kadanoff approach@xcite , then leads to a momentum- and frequency - independent irreducible particle - hole vertex for the spin channel that satisfies@xcite @xmath18 . the local moment sum rule and the pauli principle in the form @xmath19 then determine double occupancy and @xmath20 .",
    "the irreducible vertex for the charge channel is too complicated to be computed exactly , so it is assumed to be constant and its value is found from the pauli principle and the local charge fluctuation sum rule . to be more specific ,",
    "let us use the notation , @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively bosonic and fermionic matsubara frequencies .",
    "we work in units where @xmath25 @xmath26 and lattice spacing are all unity .",
    "the spin and charge susceptibilities now take the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 computed with the green function @xmath30 that contains the self - energy whose functional differentiation gave the vertices .",
    "this self - energy is constant , corresponding to the hartree - fock - type factorization . as it would in the trivial hartree - fock factorization ( see previous note ) .",
    "] the susceptibilities thus satisfy conservation laws@xcite .",
    "one enforces the pauli principle @xmath19 implicit in the following two sum rules , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density .",
    "the above equations , in addition to@xcite @xmath33 suffice to determine the constant vertices @xmath20 and @xmath34 .",
    "once the two - particle quantities have been found as above , the next step of the approach of ref .  ,",
    "consists in improving the approximation for the single - particle self - energy by starting from an exact expression where the high - frequency hartree - fock behavior is explicitly factored out .",
    "one then substitutes in the exact expression the irreducible low - frequency vertices @xmath20 and @xmath34 as well as @xmath35 and @xmath36 computed above .",
    "the exact form for the self - energy expression can however be obtained either in the longitudinal or in the transverse channel . to satisfy crossing symmetry of the fully reducible vertex appearing in the general expression and to preserve consistency between one- and two - particle quantities , one averages the two possibilities to obtain @xcite@xmath37   g_{\\sigma}^{(1)}(k+q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the resulting self - energy @xmath38 on the left hand - side is at the next level of approximation so it differs from the self - energy entering the right - hand side .",
    "one can verify that the longitudinal spin fluctuations contribute an amount @xmath39 to the consistency condition@xcite",
    "@xmath40 @xmath41 and that each of the two transverse spin components as well as the charge fluctuations also each contribute @xmath42 in addition , one verifies numerically that the exact sum rule@xcite @xmath43/\\pi = u^{2}n_{-\\sigma}(1-n_{-\\sigma})$ ] determining the high - frequency behavior is satisfied to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the theory also has a consistency check .",
    "indeed , the exact expression for consistency between one- and two - particle quantities should be written with @xmath44 given by @xmath45 instead of with @xmath46 .",
    "in other words @xmath47 @xmath41 should be satisfied instead of @xmath48 @xmath49 which is exactly satisfied here .",
    "we find through qmc benchmarks that when the left- and right - hand side of the last equation differ only by a few percent , then the theory is accurate .",
    "to obtain the thermodynamics , one finds the entropy by integrating @xmath50 times the specific heat @xmath51 so that we know @xmath52 .",
    "there are other ways to obtain the thermodynamics and one looks for consistency between these.@xcite we will not discuss thermodynamic aspects in the present review .    at weak coupling in the repulsive model",
    "the particle - hole channel is the one that is influenced directly .",
    "correlations in crossed channels , such as pairing susceptibilities , are induced indirectly and are harder to evaluate .",
    "this simply reflects the fact the simplest hartree - fock factorization of the hubbard model does not lead to a d - wave order parameter ( even though hartree - fock factorization of its strong - coupling version does ) .",
    "the @xmath53-wave susceptibility is defined by @xmath54 with the @xmath55-wave order parameter equal to @xmath56 the sum over @xmath57 being over nearest - neighbors , with @xmath58 depending on whether @xmath57 is a neighbor along the @xmath59 or the @xmath60 axis .",
    "briefly speaking,@xcite to extend tpsc to compute pairing susceptibility , we begin from the schwinger - martin - kadanoff - baym formalism with both diagonal@xcite and off - diagonal@xcite source fields .",
    "the self - energy is expressed in terms of spin and charge fluctuations and the irreducible vertex entering the bethe - salpeter equation for the pairing susceptibility is obtained from functional differentiation .",
    "the final expression for the @xmath55-wave susceptibility is ,    @xmath61    in the above expression , @xmath62 is the form factor for the gap symmetry , while @xmath63 and @xmath64 stand for both wave - vector and fermionic matsubara frequencies on a square - lattice with @xmath65 sites at temperature @xmath66 the spin and charge susceptibilities take the form @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 with @xmath29 computed with the green function @xmath30 that contains the self - energy whose functional differentiation gave the spin and charge vertices .",
    "the values of @xmath70 @xmath34 and @xmath71 are obtained  as described above . in the pseudogap regime",
    ", one can not use @xmath72 .",
    "instead,@xcite one uses the local - moment sum rule with the zero temperature value of @xmath73 obtained by the method of ref .",
    "that agrees very well with qmc calculations at all values of @xmath74 also , @xmath75 contains self - energy effects coming from spin and charge fluctuations , as described above.@xcite    the same principles and methodology can be applied for the attractive hubbard model.@xcite in that case , the dominant channel is the s - wave pairing channel .",
    "correlations in the crossed channel , namely the spin and charge susceptibilities , can also be obtained _ mutatis mutandi _ along the lines of the previous paragraph .      to test any non - perturbative approach , we need reliable benchmarks .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations provide such benchmarks .",
    "the results of such numerical calculations are unbiased and they can be obtained on much larger system sizes than any other simulation method .",
    "the statistical uncertainty can be made as small as required .",
    "the drawback of qmc is that the sign problem renders calculations impossible at temperatures low enough to reach those that are relevant for d - wave superconductivity .",

    "it is clear that when weak - coupling - like ideas of quasiparticles scattering off each other and off collective excitations do not apply , a simple physical description becomes difficult .",

    "this is where mean - field like theories@xcite or variational approaches@xcite can help when they turn out to give results that are confirmed by more accurate and less biased methods .",
    "there are many open problems , some of which are material dependent and hence may depend on interactions not included in the simplest hubbard model .",
    "we have already mentioned the problem of the chemical potential shift in arpes for very small dopings@xcite that seems to be somewhat material dependent@xcite .",
    "it would also be important to understand additional inhomogeneous phases that are observed in certain high - temperature superconductors .",
    "that is extremely challenging for quantum cluster methods and unlikely to be possible in the very near future , except for inhomogeneities of very short wave length .",
    "also , we still need to improve concordance between the methods before we can make predictions that are quantitative at the few percent level for all physical quantities .",
    "apart from dca , there are no quantum cluster methods that have been developed yet to study two - particle response functions that are necessary to obtain results on the superfluid density and on transport in general .",
    "transport studies are being completed in tpsc.@xcite such studies are crucial since they are needed to answer questions such as : ( i ) why is it that for transport properties , such as optical conductivity , the number of carriers appears to scale with doping whereas in arpes the surface of the brillouin zone enclosed by the apparent fermi surface appears to scale with the number of electrons ?",
    "is it because the weight of quasiparticles at the fermi surface scales like the doping or because of vertex corrections or because of both ?",
    "( ii ) can we explain a vanishing superfluid density as doping goes to zero@xcite only through mott physics or can competing order do the job.,@xcite    after twenty years all the problems are not solved , but we think that we can say with confidence that the essential physics of the problem of high - temperature superconductivity is in the one - band hubbard model .",
    "at least the pseudogap , the antiferromagnetic and the d - wave superconducting phases come out from the model",
    ". refinements of that model may however be necessary as we understand more and more details of the material - specific experimental results .",
    "has a revolution been necessary to understand the basic physics of high - temperature superconductors ? certainly , it has been necessary to change our attitude towards methods of solution .",
    "we have seen that to study intermediate coupling , even starting from weak coupling , it has been necessary to drop diagrams and to rely instead on sum rules and other exact results to devise a non - perturbative approach . at strong coupling we had to accept that numerical methods are essential for progress and that we need to abandon some of the traditional physical explanations of the phenomena in terms of elementary excitations . even though progress has been relatively slow , the pace is accelerating in the last few years and there is hope that in a few years the problem will be considered for the most part solved .",
    "the theoretical methods ( numerical and analytical ) that have been developed and that still need to be developed will likely remain in the tool box of the theoretical physicist and will probably be useful to understand and perhaps even design other yet undiscovered materials with interesting properties .",
    "the success will have been the result of the patient and focused effort of a large community of scientists fascinated by the remarkable phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity .",
