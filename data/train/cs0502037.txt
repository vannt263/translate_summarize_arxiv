    "since the recent rediscovery of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes , a great deal of effort has been devoted to constructing ldpc codes that can work well with the belief - propagation iterative decoder .",
    "the studies of long block - length ldpc codes are very much established .",
    "the recent works of  @xcite , @xcite have shown that , for long block - lengths , the best performing ldpc codes are irregular codes and these codes can outperform turbo codes of the same block - length and code - rate .",
    "these long ldpc codes have degree distributions which are derived from differential evolution  @xcite or gaussian approximation  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that , using the concentration theorem  @xcite , the performance of infinitely long ldpc codes of a given degree distribution can be characterised by the average performance of the ensemble based on cycle - free assumption .",
    "this assumption , however , does not work for short and moderate block - length ldpc codes due to the inevitable existence of cycles in the underlying tanner graphs .",
    "consequently , for a given degree distribution , the performance of short block - length ldpc codes varies considerably from the ensemble performance .",
    "various methods exist for the construction of finite block - length irregular codes  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition to irregular ldpc codes , algebraic constructions exist and the resulting codes are regular and usually cyclic in nature .",
    "some examples of algebraic ldpc codes are the euclidean and projective geometry codes  @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed by the authors that , in general , there is a performance association between the code minimum distance ( @xmath2 ) and decoding convergence .",
    "the irregular ldpc codes converge very well with iterative decoding , but their @xmath2 are reasonably low . on the other hand , the algebraically constructed ldpc codes , which have high @xmath2 , tend not to converge well with the iterative decoder .",
    "it is not surprising that algebraically constructed codes may outperform the irregular codes .",
    "the latter have error - floor which is caused by the @xmath2 error - events . on the encoding side ,",
    "the existence of algebraic structure in the codes is of benefit . rather than depending on the parity - check or generator matrices for encoding , as in the case of irregular codes",
    ", a low - complexity encoder can be built for the algebraic ldpc codes .",
    "one such example is the linear shift - register encoder for cyclic ldpc codes . assuming that @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the codeword and information length respectively , algebraic codes that are cyclic offer another decoding advantage .",
    "the iterative decoder has @xmath3 parity - check equations to iterate with instead of @xmath5 equations , as in the case of non - cyclic ldpc codes , and this leads to improved performance .",
    "it has been shown that the performance of ldpc codes can be improved by going beyond the binary field  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "_ showed that , under iterative decoding , the non binary ldpc codes have better convergence properties than the binary codes  @xcite",
    ". they also demonstrated that a coding gain of @xmath6db is achieved by moving from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "non binary ldpc codes in which each symbol takes values from gf(@xmath0 ) offer an attractive scheme for higher - order modulation .",
    "the complexity of the symbol - based iterative decoder can be simplified as the extrinsic information from the component codes can be evaluated using the frequency domain dual codes decoder based on the fast - walsh - hadamard transform .    based on the pioneering works of macwilliams  @xcite,@xcite on the idempotents and the mattson - solomon polynomials , we present a generalised construction method for algebraic gf(@xmath0 ) codes that are applicable as ldpc codes .",
    "the construction for binary codes using idempotents has been investigated by shibuya and sakaniwa  @xcite , however , their investigation was mainly focused on half - rate codes . in this paper , we construct some higher code - rate non binary ldpc codes with good convergence properties .",
    "we focus on the design of short block - length ldpc codes in view of the benefits for thin data - storage , wireless , command / control data reporting and watermarking applications .",
    "one of the desirable features in any code construction technique is an effective method of determining the @xmath2 and this feature is not present in irregular code construction methods . with our idempotent - based method , the @xmath2 of a constructed code can be easily lower - bounded using the well - known bch bound .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : cyclotomic_coset ] , we briefly review the theory of the cyclotomic cosets , idempotents and mattson - solomon polynomials .",
    "based on the theory , we devise a generalised construction algorithm and present an example in section  [ sec : construction ] .",
    "we also outline an efficient and systematic algorithm to search for algebraic ldpc codes in section  [ sec : construction ] . in section  [",
    "sec : performance ] , we demonstrate the performance of the constructed codes by means of simulation and section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
