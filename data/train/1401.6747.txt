    "with the discovery of the higgs particle , all the elements of the standard model are now complete , and neutrino masses remain as the sole tangible indication of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this window into new physics is built on the foundation of the phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations , which remain to be the chief avenue through which experimental data on neutrino masses and mixing parameters are gathered .",
    "given the inherent challenges involved in conducting neutrino oscillation experiments , and the equally stringent standards required in seeking experimental evidences for new physics ; it is important that the steps from any theoretical mass models of the neutrino leading to the neutrino oscillation probability formula @xcite , which is to make direct connections with experiments , be free of ambiguities and errors .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to strengthen this link and provides a more rigorous derivation of the neutrino oscillation formula , while identifying the conditions under which deviations from the standard oscillation formula may be expected .",
    "this is not the first attempt towards such a goal . from the original derivation presented by pontecorvo @xcite , based on the planewave description of the neutrinos ,",
    "modifications have been suggested to give a more physical description of the neutrino itself , by describing them with wave packets @xcite in the quantum mechanical formalism , to mirror the way neutrinos are produced and detected locally .",
    "these wave packets are put in by hand without considerations as to how they are formed .",
    "this gives a set of conditions under which neutrino oscillation can occur , namely , there exist a coherence length and that the neutrino wave packet must have a size small compared to the oscillation length .",
    "this last condition rules out the plane wave description .",
    "further investigations @xcite , taking into considerations the production processes of the neutrinos , reveal that neutrinos are produced in weak decays in an entangled state with the associated charged lepton , and that on tracing out the lepton state ( or the rest of the decay products ) , the remaining neutrino state can only be plane waves .",
    "this reveals the problem of disentangling the neutrino while maintaining its wave packet form .    the most common way around this problem in the quantum field theoretical treatment of neutrino oscillation is , instead of tracing out the lepton state from the joint neutrino - lepton decayed ( from an unstable parent ) state in some basis ( for example eigen - states ) , the lepton is assumed to be measured as a wave packet .",
    "thus , a corresponding wave packet is induced , through entanglement , on the neutrino state .",
    "this is done for the external wave packet model ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , in which the neutrino is described as a virtual particle ( therefore , not an `` external '' particle ; see for example @xcite ) , and all external particles are each assigned a wave packet . for the intermediate wave packet model @xcite ( for example @xcite ) , in which a neutrino is treated as a real particle ,",
    "the neutrino is simply assumed to exist as a wave packet , as in the quantum mechanical wave packet treatment , and thus does not address the issue of neutrino localization .",
    "we feel that since in most of the treatments just mentioned , the neutrino oscillation formula is dependent on the sizes of the particle wave packets , including the measured lepton wave packet ; this means that the ways in which the leptons are measured ( for example , the spatial resolution of the detector measuring it ) must be discernable by the neutrino observer . in a hypothetical neutrino - lepton epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) scenario , causality might be violated ( effects of the measurement of the recoil particle on neutrino oscillation through entanglement is also discussed in @xcite and @xcite , with the conclusion that neutrino oscillation is not observable if phases due to the recoil particle is significant ; but this effect would be discernable to the neutrino detector ) .",
    "thus , to avoid potential complications , we build a full quantum field theoretical model based on local interactions ( for example the 4 fermion weak interactions ) , assuming wave packets only for the source particle ( producing neutrinos through decay ) and the detector particle ( absorbs the neutrino to give a lepton ) . the neutrino wave packet in our model results from the decay process itself , as the lepton state is traced out in a convenient basis ( momentum basis ) .",
    "we consider a decoherence time ( @xmath0 ) between the decayed and the undecayed state of the source , after which the neutrino is emitted ( source collapsed to the decayed state ) , and propagates for the time , @xmath1 , when the neutrino wave function overlap with that of the detector particle and the detection interaction begins .    during this interaction ,",
    "the neutrino - detector state evolves into a superposition of the detection ( neutrino absorbed ) and non - detection ( neutrino not absorbed ) state , which collapsed into the former at the end of the time interval @xmath2 ( decoherence time associated with detection ) .",
    "thus , we are concerned with 3 time scales , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are present in all neutrino oscillation scenario , and show how they enter into the neutrino oscillation formula .",
    "we assume no particular forms for the wave packets describing the source and the detector particles , except that their sizes are much smaller than the decoherence time scales ( @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "our model is considered as an intermediate wave packet model .",
    "more examples of earlier works done on the field theoretical treatment of neutrino can be found in @xcite , which include considerations of neutrino propagators both in vacuum and matter @xcite , as well as the possibility of constructing the hilbert space for neutrino flavor states @xcite .    in this paper , we begin by highlighting a potential problem which occurs in modeling neutrino oscillation as a process involving the exchange of virtual neutrinos between a source and a detector ( which is common in such field theoretical models ) .",
    "it is shown that there is a conflict between unitary and causality in the probabilities obtain in such treatments .",
    "this will serve as a motivation for the development of a model that is free from such problems , which will be the subject of the rest of the paper .",
    "we conclude with the derivation of a neutrino count rate formula , which will be useful for making direct connection with experiments , followed by a discussion of results .",
    "as mentioned in the last section , virtual neutrino models consider neutrino oscillation as a single process including both the neutrino production and detection interactions . to calculate the probability for such a process",
    ", one computes the corresponding feynman as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "@xmath3 ( source / detector ) is the in - going states of the scattering , that include the state of the source which will emit the neutrino , and the state of the detector before neutrino detection .",
    "@xmath4 represents the products of this interaction .",
    "the neutrino is the propagator connecting the production / detection vertices located at the space - time points , @xmath5/@xmath6 , while @xmath7 is the space - time uncertainties of the production / detection .",
    "we shall show that under such a context , this ampltiude can not be both causal and unitary .    by causal ,",
    "we mean the energy resolution of the process allows us to distinguish the source ( emitting energy / neutrino ) from the detector ( receiving energy / neutrino ) ; this naturally implies a temporal ordering ( emission before detection ) , since the energy of the neutrino is positive .",
    "causality is ensured in such models by choosing the appropriate external wave packets ( wave functions of the in / out - going particles ) such that @xmath8 and @xmath7 do not overlap .",
    "the unitarity condition is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the transfer matrix , @xmath11 are the initial / final states , @xmath12 are the intermediate states . by the cutting equation @xcite , the cut diagram corresponding to that in fig.1",
    "is shown in fig.2 ( note that momentum flows from the shaded to the unshaded side of the cut ) , and this diagram must corresponds to terms on the r.h.s .",
    "of @xmath13 in order for unitarity to be satisfied .",
    "since causality is imposed via the external wave packets , the cut diagram does not vanished .",
    "but because the neutrino is exchange through the t - channel , this diagram could not represent any of the terms on the r.h.s .",
    "of @xmath13 , hence violating unitarity .",
    "this implies that field theoretical approaches to neutrino oscillation employing the exchange of virtual neutrinos is inherently inconsistent , and the probabilties thus derived may appear unitary only because they are normalized by hand . in general ,",
    "the only meaningful temporal ordering in @xmath14-matices are between the @xmath15 states and not the interaction points , which exist in a cloud of space - time uncertainty .",
    "since , as shown in @xcite , such a virtual neutrino model , with appropriately chosen external wave packets could reproduce the results of most neutrino oscillation models ( even those that do not involve virtual neutrinos ) , it is therefore prudent to re - examine the neutrino oscillation probabilities , putting special emphasis on the issues of unitarity and causality . with these considerations in mind",
