    "<S> some friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) models were analyzed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the cosmic holographic principle has been examined using these models @xcite-@xcite . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we extend these results studying frw models in @xmath4 dimensions filled with a perfect fluid , obeying a @xmath0-law equation of state , and a homogeneous scalar field @xmath5 minimally coupled to gravity with a self - interacting potential @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the cases where the scalar field energy density , @xmath7 , redshifts as @xmath1 , with @xmath8 ( @xmath2 denotes the scale factor ) are the only ones considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find new exact solutions for some ranges of values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 and the potential required to agree with the above redshift for the scalar field energy density is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath3 is chosen such that the scalar field contributes with a negative pressure since we are interested in the counterparts of the @xmath9 dimensional  quintessence models \" @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these type of models has been investigated since cosmological observations indicate that there must be some kind of dark energy with negative pressure in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the range considered for @xmath3 fits cosmological observations properly . </S>",
    "<S> although cosmological observations are irrelevant in three dimensions , from theoretical point of view it is interesting to investigate the non - trivial features of the cosmological solutions , arising from consider universes containing two fluids , which have a positive and a negative pressure , respectively . as we shall see below , these cases , discussed in terms of the energy conditions , have important differences with respect to the @xmath9 dimensional ones . </S>",
    "<S> matter with negative pressure also has been considered in the analysis of the holographic principle in four dimensional two - fluid universes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a homogeneous and isotropic universe in three dimensions is described by the line element @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scale factor and @xmath12 for hyperbolic , flat and circular two - dimensional spatial geometry , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> momentum tensor @xmath22 this occurs because the scalar field interacts with no fields other than gravity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , equations ( [ conservatotal ] ) and ( [ conservaphi ] ) imply @xmath23 therefore , each energy - momentum tensor is conserved independently and the dynamics the our model is governed by the friedmann equation ( [ fe1 ] ) and the conservation laws ( [ conservaphi ] ) and ( [ conservafluid ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the pressure @xmath20 and the density @xmath19 of the fluid are related by the @xmath0-law @xmath24 and that the field obeys the same type of equation of state @xmath25 note that ( [ sephi ] ) does not overdetermine the system of equations since the potential @xmath6 is not specified . </S>",
    "<S> this potential , consistent with the above equation of state , or equivalently with the redshift ( [ denfield ] ) , will be calculated below . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure was first used in @xcite , and recently has been considered in relation to quintessence scenario ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .    using the the energy  </S>",
    "<S> momentum tensor conservation law and the equation of state for each matter component , we obtain @xmath26 and @xmath27 where the constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the scale factor and the energy densities at @xmath31 , respectively .    to find solutions for our model we replace the equations of state ( [ se ] ) and ( [ sephi ] ) , and the energy density expressions ( [ density ] ) and ( [ denfield ] ) in equation ( [ fe1 ] ) . after straightforward manipulations , we obtain @xmath32 we note from equation ( [ integra ] ) that @xmath33 and @xmath34 must be satisfy @xmath35 in order to have a real value for @xmath15 .    </S>",

    "<S> implies @xmath56 . therefore , in @xmath4 dimensions wec and sec place independent positivity conditions on the density and pressure . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ fe2 ] ) allows us to conclude that if sec is satisfied ( in @xmath4 dimensions ) then @xcite @xmath57 which is analogous to the @xmath55-dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cosmological solutions must be non - inflationary , independent of whether the universe is open , flat , or closed . sec can be violated by a positive cosmological constant or by a a scalar field with a negative mean pressure @xcite . in the models of inflation in @xmath9 dimensions , which consider an effective cosmological constant </S>",
    "<S> , all the solutions have @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> a late - time accelerated expansion of the scale factor occurs in frw models filled with dust and some kind of energy with a negative average pressure ( a positive cosmological constant or a self- interacting scalar field ) . in these scenarios , during the most part of the lifetime of the universe the expansion is decelerating . at very late times the acceleration becomes zero and then begins to increase .    in the @xmath59-dimensional case , </S>",
    "<S> since the acceleration depends only on the pressure , an inflationary solution for the scale factor is obtained if the total pressure is negative . for a dust filled universe with a negative cosmological constant or a scalar field energy density </S>",
    "<S> the scale factor is always accelerating . </S>",
    "<S> solutions with a late - time accelerated expansion are found for perfect fluids with nonzero pressure , i. e. , with @xmath60 . </S>"
