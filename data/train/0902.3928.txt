    "less than a century ago the very nature of `` spiral nebulae '' ( galactic vs. extragalactic ) was actively debated , whereas today we observe galaxies forming and interacting throughout the universe .",
    "surprisingly , we know other galaxies far better than we know the milky way . since we are inside the milky way , it has proven very difficult to properly characterize its structure , because dust obscures most of the galaxy at optical , and to some extent at ir , wavelengths and distances beyond the extended solar neighborhood are often quite uncertain . thus , we only have an `` educated guess '' that the milky way is a barred sb or sc galaxy , and even the number of spiral arms ( 2 or 4 ) is actively debated @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a radio frequency transition of atomic hydrogen ( hi at 21 cm wavelength ) in the 1950s offered the hope that , freed from extinction problems , one could map the structure of the milky way . hi emission on galactic longitude versus",
    "velocity plots clearly demonstrated that there are coherent , large - scale structures , which probably are spiral arms .",
    "however , determining accurate distances to hi clouds proved problematic , and this made the task of turning longitude - velocity data into a true `` plan - view '' of the milky way very uncertain @xcite .",
    "later , millimeter - wave observations of co molecules also revealed coherent , large - scale structures with higher contrast than seen in hi @xcite .",
    "but , again , uncertain distances to molecular clouds precluded making a true map of the milky way with sufficient accuracy to trace its spiral structure .",
    "@xcite constructed a plan - view model of the spiral structure of the milky way ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : milky_way ] ) .",
    "their approach involved combining optical observations of young stars and radio data of hi clouds and hii regions .",
    "luminosity distances to nearby stars were used where available and kinematic distances elsewhere , mostly for distant hii regions . while subject to very significant uncertainties from kinematic distances , the georgelin model has remained the `` standard '' model of the spiral structure of the milky way for over 30 years .",
    "however , debate continues over such basic facts as the existence of some spiral arms , the number of arms , and the size , rotation speed and mass of the milky way .",
    "recent improvements in radio astrometry with the vlba have yielded parallaxes and proper motions to star forming regions across a significant portion of the milky way with accuracies of @xmath0  and @xmath1  , respectively @xcite .",
    "[ fig : s252_parallax ] shows the results of vlba observations of 12 ghz methanol masers associated with a massive young stellar object in the star forming region s  252 .",
    "the data yield a parallax of @xmath2  . with such data",
    "one can measure distances to sources on the far side of the milky way with 10% accuracy !    combining the results from 16 similar measurements shows the potential of vlba parallaxes for mapping the milky way @xcite .",
    "the results begin to locate spiral arms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : milky_way ] ) and yield the first direct measurement of arm pitch angles .",
    "in addition , estimates of the fundamental parameters of the milky way ,  and , indicate a rotation speed of @xmath3  , some 15% faster than usually assumed .",
    "interestingly , these first astrometric results indicate that the milky way and the andromeda galaxy @xcite have nearly identical rotational properties , suggesting similar dark matter sizes and masses and contrary to the general assertion that andromeda is significantly more massive than the milky way .    changing the value of  from the iau standard 220  to @xmath4",
    "significantly affects models of the local group of galaxies .",
    "it results in a decrease of about 20  in the space velocity of the lmc _ relative to the center of the milky way _ and an increase of about 50% in the estimated ( dark matter ) mass of the milky way . both help to bind the lmc to the milky way @xcite and",
    "reverse the conclusion , based on hst measurements of the proper motion of the lmc , that the lmc was unbound and making its first pass near the milky way @xcite .",
    "we are currently poised to make truly dramatic progress in understanding the milky way . over the next 10 to 20 years",
    ", we could measure the distance to _ every _ high mass star forming region in the galaxy with parallax accuracies of @xmath1  . at the far side of the galaxy ( 16  kpc )",
    "this would correspond to better than @xmath5% distance accuracy .",
    "_ thus , for the first time we could map in detail the spiral structure of the milky way and learn what it really looks like .",
    "_    indeed , with this accuracy one could easily resolve structure , not only across spiral arms , but also across the bar in the galactic center region , provided the density of target sources is adequate to reveal structure . finally , we would have not only the 3-dimensional locations of all major star forming regions , but also their 3-dimensional velocity vectors .",
    "this would yield extraordinarily accurate measurements ( projected to be better than @xmath6% ) of such fundamental parameters as the distance to the galactic center ( ) , the rotation speed of the lsr ( ) , the form of the rotation curve , and the kinematic effects of spiral structure .",
    "note that gaia or sim , which may have comparable astrometric accuracy , will operate at optical wavelengths and can not see through the dust in the plane of the milky way , nor to deeply embedded regions of star formation .",
    "since the ionizing radiation from ob - type stars in high mass star forming regions in the galactic plane best defines spiral structure , the most straightforward way to map this structure is through radio astrometry .",
    "ll 6.7 ghz receivers for vlba & expand number of parallax targets by @xmath7 + & to map spiral structure and dynamics of the + & ( northern ) milky way +   + high ( 32 gbps ) data recording rate and/or & parallax calibrators a factor of @xmath8 nearer + additional telescopes / collecting area & to targets , enabling sub-  astrometry +   + improved southern hemisphere vlbi & map southern portion of milky way + capability ( partial ska ) & + [ table : telescope_impact ]    the observations needed to map the milky way outlined above can be accomplished with the advances outlined in table  [ table : telescope_impact ] . some of the goals can be achieved with modest upgrades in receiver and data recording equipment at the vlba .",
    "currently most of the parallax measurements with the vlba have employed 12 ghz methanol masers .",
    "methanol masers associated with high mass star forming regions are nearly ideal astrometric targets ; they are compact , long - lived , and their motions are closely tied to the massive star that excites them .",
    "(  masers are not a good substitute .",
    "they participate in fast outflows and have lifetimes less than the 1 year necessary for good parallax measurements .",
    "also , their large internal motions make it difficult to associate a maser motion with that of its central massive star .",
    "this latter problem does not affect parallax measurement , but it does limit the interpretation of the proper motions for galactic dynamics . ) unfortunately , there are only several tens of 12 ghz methanol masers that are strong enough for vlba parallax measurement . adding a new vlba receiver , capable of observing the much stronger 6.7 ghz methanol masers , is needed to map the locations and motions of hundreds of star forming regions across major portions of the milky way .",
    "upgrading the vlba data recording rate by more than two orders of magnitude from 256 mbps to 32 gbps ( which requires no new technology ) would dramatically improve astrometric accuracy by making far more background quasars available as position references .",
    "vlba astrometric observations are usually limited by systematics that cancel proportionally to the separation of the maser target and background quasar .",
    "the factor of 11 ( @xmath9 ) improvement in continuum sensitivity from the increased recording capability would lead to an average decrease in target - quasar separation by a factor of 6 ( assuming standard @xmath10 statistics ) .",
    "this should allow parallaxes accurate to better than @xmath6  !    in order to map the entire milky way , we will need a vlba - like capability in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this could be well met by the `` ska - mid '' project , which will be placed in the southern hemisphere , provided the antennas can reach the 6.7 ghz transition of methanol masers .",
    "alternatively a relatively modest upgrade to the australian vlbi capabilities could also provide the required capabilities .    combining",
    "the above mentioned advances in receiver and recording capabilities with increased collecting area would allow measurement of weaker target sources .",
    "this could be achieved in conjunction with a `` path - finder '' project that would prototype and test antenna `` patches '' with @xmath11% of an ska collecting area .",
    "placing some of these antenna patches at vlba sites and at some new sites between the evla and the vlba would greatly increase the sensitivity of the array .",
    "some of these telescope advances could come from the phased implementation of the plans outlined in the `` north american array '' initiative ( j. ulvestad , coordinator ) submitted to the decadal survey .",
    "the construction of even a 5% ska in the southern hemisphere would allow exquisite mapping of the entire milky way .",
    "finally , we note that the construction of the entire ska concept would revolutionize all of these activities and lead to truly dramatic astrometric results .",
