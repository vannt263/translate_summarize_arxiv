    "while the basic properties of riemann  stieltjes integrals ( and related lebesgue  stieltjes integrals ) are covered in classical textbooks on real analysis and integration @xcite , the following simple question is not addressed in them .",
    "[ question ] if @xmath2 is positive , @xmath3 is non - negative , non - vanishing , and satisfies @xmath6 , can we then select the upper limit of integration @xmath7 so that the integral is positive ?",
    "the answer to the question is obviously yes for riemann integrals ( @xmath8 ) , which could help to explain why it has been overlooked so far .",
    "in fact , after an extensive search of the literature , we believe that question [ question ] has not been answered before in the full generality .",
    "( we shall comment later , in remark [ finalcomment ] , why the present generality may be relevant in applications . )",
    "the only reference known to us is a note by satyanarayana @xcite where an affirmative answer is proven under a slightly different set of assumptions , most importantly , assuming that @xmath3 is _ non - decreasing_.    let us stress that _ positive _ will here always mean _ strictly positive_. in particular , since @xmath2 is continuous , under our assumptions @xmath9 .",
    "recall that , since @xmath3 is of bounded variation , there exist non - decreasing functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 . therefore , finite @xmath13 and @xmath14 exist for any @xmath15 $ ] ( apart from @xmath16 and @xmath17 , obviously ) .",
    "moreover , the integral is equal to @xmath18 since @xmath6 , we may assume that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are non - negative and satisfy @xmath19 .",
    "we may now distinguish two special cases , where it is evident that the answer to question [ question ] is yes .    1 .",

    "the first item follows from the elementary lower bound , valid for @xmath27 , @xmath28 whereas the second item is a straightforward consequence of @xmath19 .",
    "in general , the integral is positive if and only if @xmath29 obviously , the condition @xmath30 is equivalent to @xmath31 , and we have @xmath32 if and only if @xmath33",
    ". it would be tempting to conjecture that , as a continuous function , @xmath2 is  nearly constant \" in some neighborhood of @xmath34 and , hence , that the inequality ought to hold for @xmath23 with some  small \" @xmath22 , suggesting an affirmative answer to question [ question ] in general .",
    "the proviso @xmath6 may seem superfluous as the value of the integral does not depend on @xmath35 .",
    "however , together with the condition @xmath36 it constrains the behavior of @xmath3 near @xmath34 , which is a key part of the formulation of question [ question ] .",
    "it should also be stressed that the continuity of @xmath2 is equally important ",
    "aside from the possible non - existence of the integral , there is no reason to expect the answer to question [ question ] to be yes when @xmath2 fails to be continuous .",
    "unfortunately , the heuristic above is too simple - minded since mere continuity does not restrict the _ fine properties _ of the integrand @xmath2 and leaves it with enough room to vary  too much \" for our purposes .",
