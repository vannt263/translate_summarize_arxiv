    "the dispersive interaction between small neutral , unpolarised particles ( atoms , molecules etc . ) and an uncharged macroscopic object is a manifestation of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field and related to the zero - point energy @xcite . in the first quantum electrodynamical treatment of this van der waals ( vdw ) type force @xcite , and in many other related works",
    ", the atom was assumed to be located in free space . in reality , the atom may be submerged in or be a part of a gas , liquid , or even solid  a situation typical in diverse fields such as colloid science @xcite , surface engineering @xcite , and biology @xcite . as a particular example from biology , one can cite the transfer of a small particle diluted in cell plasma through a cell membrane caused by vdw forces @xcite . a question that may arise when the atom is embedded in a medium",
    "is how the vdw interaction is to be corrected due to the difference between the local fields acting on the atom and the macroscopic fields averaged over a region which contains a great number of the medium constituents , thus ignoring the gaps between them . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vdw interaction between two ground - state atoms embedded in adjacent semi - infinite magnetodielectric media has been considered .",
    "comparison of this result with that deduced from the casimir force on a thin composite slab in front of a composite semi - infinite medium , both obeying the clausius - mossotti relation , suggests a hint on how to account for the local - field correction .",
    "this confirmed shortly after in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis on a macroscopic quantum electrodynamics theory and the real - cavity model  @xcite .",
    "a general formula for the vdw potential in an arbitrary geometry has been derived in the form of a sum of a translationally invariant term and and a term containing the uncorrected scattering green tensor modified by a local - field correction factor @xcite .",
    "this general formula is applicable for meta - materials @xcite and will serve as a starting point for our treatment of the local - field corrected vdw interaction in a stratified magnetodielectric .",
    "note that a generalisation of the formalism has recently been used to study local - field corrected interactions of an excited atom with a ground - state one across an interface between two media @xcite .",
    "the interaction between a neutral atom and a material surface is customarily split into two parts : a short - range repulsive part , significant when the atomic valence electrons overlap with the surface , and a longer - range dispersive vdw part @xcite .",
    "theories that focus on the vdw interaction commonly neglect the first , thus are incapable of correctly predicting the behaviour of the interaction potential at very short distances .",
    "they typically yield a power law of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , atom ",
    "surface distance ) for materials with dominant electric properties , and a power law of @xmath2 for purely magnetic materials , which lead to divergent values for the vdw potential right on the surface @xcite . due to the importance of phenomena such as physisorption and transport of particles through interfaces and membranes ,",
    "much effort has been devoted to a better treatment of the atom ",
    "surface interaction when the two are at very short distances . with respect to physisorption ,",
    "this has been done via introducing a reference plane @xcite ; via characterising the material surface by a more realistic response function which includes spatial dispersion @xcite , smooth variation of the dielectric properties at the interface , and the contribution from d electrons to the screening @xcite ; and via using an atomic polarisability going beyond the dipole approximation @xcite .",
    "these studies typically produce finite values for the interaction potential at the interface @xcite .    in the present paper , the local - field corrected vdw interaction of a ground - state atom embedded in a planar , dispersing and absorbing magnetoelectric host medium",

    "the behaviour of the potential @xmath141 in the boundary regions is similar to that in the two - layer systems .",

    "for example , let an atom be initially located in layer 3 ( vacuum ) of case ( a ) .",
    "first , it will be attracted to the 2 - 3 interface .",
    "if it can be transported through the interface and gather enough momentum going down the slope , it can pass the finite potential wall and is then attracted to the 1 - 2 interface . after this interface , and maybe some oscillations",
    ", it will be suspended in the potential well near the surface .",
    "we now turn to the symmetric configuration ( right column of fig .",
    "[ a3 ] ) where the middle layer 2 is sandwiched between two identical layers 1 and 3 .",
    "the behaviour of the potential on the right is just a mirror image of that on the left with the mirror plane being the one parallel to the surface and passing through the centre of the middle layer .",
    "when the thickness of layer @xmath86 is largest @xmath211 [ case ( d ) ] , we see in layer 2 a combination of two potential walls as found in fig .",
    "[ za1 ] , with a well in the middle .",
    "thus even as the middle layer is in general less dense than the two surrounding layers in both electric and magnetic aspects , there exists a possibility that an atom initially located in the potential well remains there . with decreasing thickness @xmath212 , the bottom of the well rises and the two walls eventually merge into one [ cases ( e ) and ( f ) ] .",
    "clearly , in the cases ( e ) and ( f ) , any atom initially situated in the middle layer will be transported to the neighboring layers .",
    "numerical computation also shows that the magnitude of the position - independent term in @xmath141 , i.e. , the last term in eq .",

    "[ a3 ] , the uncorrected potentials are plotted by dashed lines . in the two outer layers ,",
    "the effects of the local field almost remain the same as in the two - layer configuration , which can be explained by that the presence of a third layer is screened by the middle layer . for the middle layer",
    ", we have found that typically , the local - field correction is most significant around the centre of the layer , as is most manifest in case ( f ) where a correction [ @xmath213 of more than 80% is observed .",
    "a variation of the middle layer thickness does not affect much the strength of the local field correction near the surfaces .",
    "this can be understood as resulting from the fact that when an atom is located very close to a surface , it will tend to see only the nearest neighboring layer .",
    "if one wish to know the potentials right on the surfaces , one would have to evaluate the full potential @xmath214 for atom  surface distances large enough such that the macroscopic theory applies , then use it as an input to the procedure proposed in the previous section . since the position - independent part @xmath44 does not depend on the layer thicknesses , at each surface in a more - than - two - layer system",
    ", the results will be closely analogous to those of the two - layer case .",
    "our results might be of interest in biological applications such as the transfer of a small molecule through a membrane from one cell to another .",
    "earlier theories have been developed to describe the vdw interaction between molecules or small particles and a solvent medium @xcite .",
    "in particular , such particles were modeled by a small dielectric sphere of radius @xmath215 and ( macroscopic ) permittivity @xmath216 .",
    "it was found that the nonretarded dispersion potential of such a sphere near the interface of two dielectric media ( with the sphere being situated in a medium of permittivity @xmath148 , and @xmath145 denoting the permittivity of the medium on the far side of the interface ) is given by @xmath217 here , @xmath218 is the distance from the sphere to the surface and @xmath219 is the excess or effective polarisability @xcite of the dissolved particle in the medium .",
    "this potential already accounts for the fact that the ( macroscopic ) particle has a finite volume and can hence only move by displacing an equal volume of solvent from its path ( with associated pressure forces being present ) ; the excess polarisability and hence also the potential must vanish when a dissolved particle has the same properties as the solvent .",
    "equation  ( [ ubio ] ) is the macroscopic counterpart of our microscopic equations ( [ ubshort])([c2 ] ) , where the position - dependent part of our potential for purely dielectric solvent media reads @xmath220 the results from a microscopic description of the particle as a system of bound point charges , leading to our eq .  ( [ ubshort1 ] ) , are thus formally very similar to those from a macroscopic model of the particle as a dielectric sphere , eq .",
    "( [ ubio ] ) .",
    "the main difference is the fact that the microscopic polarisability  ( [ alpha ] ) together with a local - field correction factor appears in eq .",
    "( [ ubshort1 ] ) , while the macroscopic excess polarisability  ( [ abio ] ) which effectively accounts for pressure forces enters eq .",
    "( [ ubio ] ) . depending on the size of the immersed particle",
    ", one of the two models may provide a more realistic description : for very small particles like atoms or small molecules whose size is comparable to the free interspaces between the atoms forming the solvent medium , local - field effects are important while ( macroscopic ) pressure forces can not even be defined , so that the microscopic result  ( [ ubshort1 ] ) should be used . for larger molecules",
    "whose volume covers a region that would otherwise be occupied by a large number of solvent atoms , local - field effects can be neglected while pressure forces become relevant , so eq .  ( [ ubio ] )",
    "should be given preference .",
    "as an additional difference , note that our microscopic calculation has also given layer - dependent constant contributions to the potential , which are absent in eq .",
    "( [ ubio ] ) .",
    "similar considerations apply in the retarded limit , where the macroscopic potential of the small sphere was found to be @xcite @xmath221 whereas our microscopic result as given by eqs .",

    "[ ubio_ret ] ) and ( [ ubio_ret1 ] ) ] are now also different in general , note that they do agree in the limit of small dielectric contrast between the media , @xmath224 .",
    "to conclude , we have the local - field corrected vdw potential of a ground state atom embedded in a planar magnetodielectric multilayer system by analytical and numerical means .",
    "the theory allows us to extend earlier studies of the same system in two important aspects : first , one can allow for the atom to be embedded in a medium thus making the theory applicable to a larger range of realistic situations ; second , the effects of the local - field correction is elucidated .",
    "the formulas for the interaction potential have been derived for an arbitrary number of layers where the case of two- and three - layer systems have been studied in detail .",
    "we have shown that the potential can be decomposed into two parts : a layer - dependent constant part which depends on the real - cavity radius , i.e. , the density of the medium the atom is placed in ; and a position - dependent part which contains the local - field correction as a factor in the integral over frequency .",
    "for the latter , we have presented retarded and non - retarded limits and the considered case of neighboring media of similar properties .",
    "distance laws have been reestablished with effects of the local field included where the local - field correction has been found to be as high as 80% in certain cases .",
    "further , numerical calculations show that an interplay between electric and magnetic properties of the neighboring media may lead to the appearance of potential wells or walls near the surface",
    ". these structures are potentially helpful as a trapping mechanism . although these structures are much less intense in magnitude than those occurring for an excited atom @xcite , they are more permanent because an atom in the ground state has an infinitely long lifetime",
    ".    the constant part of the potential , which originates from local - field effects , does not contribute to the vdw forces , but it can facilitate our understanding of the movement of an atom near an interface , and is instrumental in our proposed estimate of the on - surface value of the potential : after calculating the total potential in both sides of an interface up to distances equal to the radius of the ( real ) cavity , beyond which a macroscopic model no longer applies , the average of the two potential values taken at these distances can be regarded as the potential at the interface .",
    "our procedure improves previous similar estimates by including local - field effects and consistently removing self - interactions .    in the case of the three - layer system ,",
    "emphasis was given to the influence of the thickness of the middle layer .",
    "while new features may arise for a very thin middle layer , the behaviour of the potential is simply those at the interfaces combined if the middle layer is thick enough .    our results , which have been obtained on the basis of an exact , microscopic model of the atom  field coupling , are complementary to previous more macroscopic dispersion potentials of particles modelled as small spheres .",
    "the model of preference depends on the size of the particle in the specific situations considered . in the future",
    ", efforts should be taken to find a dispersion potential which holds for all possible ranges of particle sizes and includes both the microscopic and macroscopic potentials as limiting cases .",
    "our considerations may easily be extended to other geometries , such as spherically or cylindrically layered host media ."
