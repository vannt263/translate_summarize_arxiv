    "in the quantized hall regime , a clean two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) with electron density @xmath1 in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath2 exhibits quantized steps in the hall resistance near values of magnetic field where the filling factor , @xmath3 is an integer or odd - denominator fraction , describing the integer @xcite or fractional @xcite quantum hall effect , respectively .",
    "these steps result from a mobility gap in the bulk region , leaving gapless edge modes responsible for describing current conduction in the system @xcite .",
    "early @xcite and recent @xcite experiments on the quantum hall effect tested the equilibration properties of edge channels in gated structures that populate different channels at different chemical potentials .",
    "however , the reduced mobility of low - density gated regions restricts the filling factor combinations that can be tested , and in planar structures co- and counterpropagating equilibration studies require fundamentally different gate designs @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper a new type of device for studying edge state equilibration which permits abrupt junctions between arbitrary filling factors of both co- _ and _ counter - propagating edges , simply by tilting the sample in a magnetic field .",
    "we call our device the corner - quantum well heterojunction ( cqw ) , fabricated by overgrowing a standard gaas / algaas heterojunction structure on a precleaved corner @xcite as depicted schematically in fig . 1 , left",
    ". the length of the corner junction in the data presented here is @xmath4 3.2  mm , and indium contacts are alloyed to each facet away from the corner junction , and indexed as shown in the top perspective of fig .",
    "1 , right . we identify one side of the device as the substrate ( s ) , and the other side as the precleave ( p ) as in fig . 1 @xcite , and measure slightly different electron densities for the two facets under different cool - downs as listed in the captions of fig . 2 and fig .",
    "we designate the contact configuration of all 4-point resistance measurements with the notation @xmath5 for current leads @xmath6 and voltage measured between @xmath7 .",

    "in the presence of a tilted magnetic field at an angle @xmath24 relative to the substrate normal ( fig .",
    "1 , left ) the relative filling factor between the two systems @xmath25 can be tuned according to :    @xmath26    the high quality of the growth is demonstrated by fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) minima appearing on both facets below 1 k. for angles @xmath27 the edge channels counter - propagate at the corner reminiscent of the coupling chirality between gated qhe regions in standard planar structures .",
    "but for @xmath28 , the normal component of the magnetic field _",
    "changes sign _ across the junction , resulting in a junction of _ co - propagating _ edge states of arbitrary filling factor simply by tilting the junction in a b - field .",
    "we begin our hall measurements in the @xmath29 regime .",
    "2 , top , shows @xmath8 and @xmath30 for @xmath12 , corresponding to a magnetic field tilt angle of @xmath31 .",
    "the minimae of the series @xmath32 ( 1:3 ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 go to zero for both @xmath35 traces , validating the use of the edge channel picture at these fields .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows a cartoon of the ( 1:3 ) case , showing the sign of the normal @xmath2-field component in each region . in fig .",
    "2 , bottom , @xmath9 and @xmath11 are plotted along with the 4-point corner resistance @xmath10 . because current contact number 2 feeds both voltage contacts 4 and 8 , the 4-point resistance @xmath36 is trivially zero . by inspection then , @xmath16 is just the difference between the two hall resistances , @xmath37 confirming the landauer - bttiker picture @xcite with full equilibration of edge channels on reaching contact 1 .",
    "next we examine @xmath38 , the condition novel to this paper where the normal magnetic field changes sign across the junction , and the edge channel in the precleave system correspondingly switches chirality ( fig .",
    "3 , inset ) .",
    "3 , top , shows @xmath8 and @xmath30 for @xmath20 , corresponding to a @xmath2-field tilt angle of @xmath39 .",
    "there we see well - developed minimae at @xmath32 ( 2:4 ) and ( 1:2 ) . in this novel geometry ,",
    "the co - propagating edge channels at the @xmath40 mm long corner fully equilibrate , meaning the downstream potential at contacts 4 and 8 are equal and @xmath36 .",
    "correspondingly , the only non - trivial 4-point resistance is again @xmath10 . with the opposite chirality in the two systems",
    ", we note that since @xmath41 has changed polarity @xmath16 is now the _ sum _ of the individual @xmath15 s : @xmath42 .",
    "it is worth noting that in planar gate defined geometries , no 4-point resistance can be _ larger _ than the largest individual @xmath15 , so we have successfully demonstrated a new regime of validity for the landauer - bttiker formalism .    it remains to be seen what physics will be observed at junction lengths @xmath43 of order the interchannel equilibration length , where outgoing channels from the corner are not fully equilibrated , but rather partially reflected / transmitted .",
    "in such a case , dependences on co- versus counter - propagation as well as on the specific value @xmath44 are anticipated , and at a lossless junction , novel effects like a dc step - up transformer are predicted , due to andreev - like quasiparticle reflection @xcite .",
    "future experiments with small junctions can also measure interchannel equilibration lengths for both co- and counterpropagating edges in the same device .",
    "in conclusion , we observe quantum hall effect in a new corner quantum well structure .",
    "the relative filling factor between 2degs on the two facets of the corner is tunable by tilting the magnetic field angle , and two different regimes are studied where the edge channels at the corner junction are co- and counter - propagating .",
    "this paper determines that the device functions as expected , and is well behaved in the quantum hall regime ."
