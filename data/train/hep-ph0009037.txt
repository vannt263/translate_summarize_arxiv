    "in recent years the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons off hadrons has been the object of intensive theoretical studies . in qcd the hadronic tensor for electron proton dis",
    "is usually regarded as a convolution of two objects : the `` partonic '' tensor @xmath5 describing dis off a ( nearly ) on - shell parton ( quark or gluon ) and the probability @xmath6 to find the parton in the nucleon .",
    "as is well known , they have a different description : whereas the tensor @xmath5 can be calculated within perturbation theory , there are no model - independent methods of calculating @xmath6 , but only the general behaviour with respect to the kinematical variables can be predicted . usually , the hadronic tensor @xmath5 is presented in terms of the structure functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 :    @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the momentum , mass and polarization of the incoming parton and @xmath13 is the momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "the structure functions depend on the bjorken variable @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "each of the structure functions consists of flavour singlet and flavour non - singlet ( ns ) contributions .",
    "although the singlet contributions accounting for gluon splitting are dominant at small @xmath0 , the ns contributions are also interesting quantities to investigate",
    ". they can be expressed in terms of densities of quarks ( @xmath17 ) and antiquarks ( @xmath18 ) inside a hadron .",
    "the non - singlet spin - dependent structure function @xmath2 refers to the combination of ( @xmath19 ) , whereas the non - singlet spin - averaged structure function @xmath1 is related to ( @xmath20 ) ; combining them one could study the evolution of @xmath21 and @xmath18 separately .",
    "the standard theoretical investigation of dis structure functions , originally developed for the kinematic region of @xmath22 and large @xmath4 , is made through the dglap @xcite evolution equations .",
    "this approach accounts for the evolution of the structure functions with respect to the photon virtuality @xmath4 , whereas the evolution with respect to @xmath0 is neglected .",
    "in other words , the dglap accounts for the resummation of all powers of @xmath23 and systematically neglects the powers of @xmath24 , which is obviously correct when @xmath0 is not small .",
    "despite the fact that the dglap equations provide a good agreement with experimental data ( see e.g. @xcite ) , they are not expected to work well in the small-@xmath0 region , where logarithms of @xmath0 are not less important than logarithms of @xmath4 and therefore must be taken into account to all orders in @xmath3 .",
    "this resummation leads to a power - like , or regge - like , behaviour in @xmath0 and in @xmath4 of the type @xmath25 .",
    "such a behaviour can not be obtained within dglap , which predicts a dependence of the type @xmath26 .    in perturbative qcd the power - like behaviour",
    "was obtained long ago @xcite for the singlet structure functions of spin - averaged dis and later in refs .",
    "@xcite for the structure functions @xmath27 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , contrary to the dglap , the results of refs .",
    "@xcite are obtained in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) with a fixed qcd coupling @xmath3 .",
    "hence the exponents calculated in @xcite ( also called intercepts ) for the predicted power - like small-@xmath0 behaviour of all structure functions contain @xmath3 fixed at a scale that is not well defined .",
    "the very existence of such a scale , sometimes called `` a reasonable scale '' , and estimates for its numerical value have been discussed in many works ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , according to the regge theory , the expressions for the intercepts must not contain @xmath3 running with @xmath4 , but , on the contrary , they just have to be numbers .",
    "thus , in order to obtain realistic values for the intercepts , one has to go beyond the lla and include the qcd running coupling effects in the evolution equations at small @xmath0 , so that the running coupling @xmath3 would be integrated out in the solutions .",
    "recently in ref .",
    "@xcite we have obtained expressions for the non - singlet structure function was denoted as @xmath28 in work @xcite . ] @xmath1 , with running qcd coupling effects taken into account .",
    "the resulting intercept does not explicitly depend on @xmath3 but depends on the infrared cut - off . that calculation prompted us to study the running qcd coupling effects for the non - singlet structure functions in more detail .",
    "the structure function @xmath2 is similar to @xmath1 , because the same feynman graphs contribute to both of them . as a result",
    ", they obey the same leading order ( lo ) dglap evolution equation .",
    "a difference between them arises only in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to dglap and can be extracted from the expressions of the second loop anomalous dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    concerning the small-@xmath0 behaviour ,",
    "the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be related to the difference in their signatures : the signature of @xmath1 is positive whereas @xmath2 has a negative one .",
    "a difference between them means that some high - order non - ladder graphs contribute to @xmath1 and @xmath2 in a different way .",
    "historically , signatures for scattering amplitudes of high energy processes were first introduced in the context of the regge theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a forward scattering amplitude @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the mandelstam variables , has positive ( negative ) signature",
    "if it is symmetrical ( antisymmetrical ) with respect to the replacement @xmath32 :    @xmath33    basically , any forward scattering amplitude @xmath34 consists of the two parts :    @xmath35    in the small-@xmath0 region , neglecting @xmath36 and @xmath37 terms , one can use @xmath38 . as",
    "the imaginary part in @xmath30 , @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , corresponds to the cross - section , this cross - section may acquire contributions from both @xmath41 and @xmath42 amplitudes .",
    "the partonic tensor @xmath5 of eq .",
    "( [ totwmunu ] ) can be considered as the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath43 of the forward compton scattering of a virtual photon on a constituent quark : @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that    @xmath45    and in particular , @xmath46    the amplitude @xmath43 is invariant with respect to the replacement @xmath47 , @xmath48 which corresponds to the crossing transition from the @xmath30-channel to the @xmath31-channel . however , the projection operators multiplying @xmath49 and @xmath27 behave differently under such a transition : the operator @xmath50 does not change , so the invariant amplitude @xmath51 multiplying it does not either . on the contrary ,",
    "the operator @xmath52 acquires a negative sign , so the invariant amplitude @xmath53 must acquire a negative sign too .",
    "therefore , the invariant amplitudes    @xmath54    and    @xmath55    have positive and negative signatures , respectively , and the dis structure functions @xmath49 and @xmath27 can be considered as imaginary parts of scattering amplitudes with positive and negative signatures :    @xmath56    the first observation of the importance of the contribution of the negative - signature amplitudes to the cross - sections was made in the context of qed in ref .",
    "later on , in ref .",
    "@xcite , quark - quark scattering amplitudes with positive and negative signatures were calculated in the double - logarithmic approximation ( dla ) .",
    "using the results of those works , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in dla , with @xmath3 fixed , the intercept of @xmath2 is larger than the intercept of @xmath1 .    in the present paper",
    "we obtain explicit expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 for small values of @xmath0 , which account for both leading double - logarithmic ( dl ) and sub - leading single - logarithmic ( sl ) contributions to all orders in qcd coupling , including running @xmath3 effects . as logarithms of both @xmath0 and @xmath4 are important at small @xmath0 , we account for both of them , constructing and solving a two - dimensional infrared evolution equation ( iree ) . in order to take running @xmath3 effects into account",
    ", we use the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the improvement made in our previous work @xcite .",
    "also , we discuss similarities and differences between running @xmath3 effects in the dglap and in our approach . finally we discuss the region of applicability of the lla and estimate the range of @xmath4 where it can be safely applied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we derive the small-@xmath0 evolution equations for the non - singlet structure functions and solve them . in section  3 we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in section  4",
    "we compare our results with the intercepts of the non - singlet structure functions obtained in lla . in section  5 our findings",
    "are compared with dglap predictions for the ns anomalous dimensions and we discuss the difference in accounting for running @xmath3 effects . finally , section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the born approximation , which is the pure ns case , @xmath43 is given by the sum of the graphs in fig .",
    "they yield    @xmath57    where @xmath58,\\ ] ] with @xmath59 being the electric charge of the incoming quark and @xmath60 , @xmath61 the mandelstam variables .",
    "we have omitted unimportant contributions proportional to @xmath62 , @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ mmunuborn ] ) .",
    "@xmath64 are amplitudes of defined signature ( cf .",
    "( [ sign ] ) ) . obviously , only the first term in eq .",
    "( [ mborn ] ) , corresponding to the graph ( a ) in fig .  [",
    "born ] , has an imaginary part in @xmath30 at @xmath65 , which gives the same contribution to the amplitudes of both signatures . according to eq .",
    "( [ ims ] ) we obtain the well - known results :    @xmath66    the property @xmath67 remains true in the next one - loop approximation , with one gluon added to graphs in fig .",
    "only the dressing of graph ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ born ] contributes to the imaginary part in @xmath30 at @xmath68 .",
    "this explains why the lo dglap splitting functions and the lo anomalous dimensions are the same for the structure functions corresponding to amplitudes with different signatures .",
    "the difference between them arises only at the second - loop order .",
    "indeed , let us consider graph ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ second ] .",
    "it is actually a non - ladder graph , obtained from the born graph ( b ) in fig .  [",
    "born ] by adding two gluons to it . on the other hand ,",
    "graph ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ second ] can be redepicted as graph ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ second ] .",
    "it is easy to check that its imaginary part in @xmath30 ( the quark propagators to be cut are marked with crosses in fig .",
    "[ second ] ) has , in particular , dl terms ( @xmath69 ) ; this graph therefore can not be neglected .",
    "then , one can see that the dl contribution of this graph , which is symmetrical in @xmath70 ( contribution to @xmath1 ) and the antisymmetrical one ( contribution to @xmath2 ) have different signs .",
    "this example shows that some higher - loop contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are different .",
    "thus , a possible regular way of calculating @xmath1 and @xmath2 consists of the following steps :    * calculate the forward scattering compton amplitude @xmath43 obtained by adding gluon propagators to both born graphs in fig .  [",
    "* extract from it the amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath53 proportional to @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( cf .",
    "( [ mmunu ] ) and ( [ fmi ] ) ) , which are the positive- and negative- signature amplitudes @xmath73 , respectively . * calculate @xmath74 .",
    "so , first we calculate @xmath43 , and we do it by constructing and solving an iree for @xmath43 . in order to account for the evolution in both @xmath0 and @xmath4 one must consider dl and sl contributions to all orders in @xmath3 .",
    "high order feynman graphs contributing to @xmath43 may have both ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities . whereas uv singularities are absorbed by renormalization",
    ", ir ones must be regulated explicitly . providing gluons with a mass violates the gauge invariance . in order to save it and to avoid ir singularities",
    ", we use the lipatov prescription of compactifying the impact parameter space ( see e.g. works @xcite ) . in other words",
    ", we introduce the infrared cut - off @xmath75 in the transverse space ( with respect to the plane formed by @xmath13 and @xmath10 ) for integrating over the momenta of virtual particles :    @xmath76    with such a cut - off acting as a mass scale , one can neglect quark masses and still be free from ir singularities . as a result",
    "the amplitude @xmath43 depends on the cut - off and we can study its evolution with respect to it , thus obtaining the iree for @xmath43 .",
    "feynman graphs contributing to the non - singlet structure functions are obtained from graphs in fig .  [",
    "born ] by adding gluon propagators to them , without breaking the quark lines , however . with logarithmic accuracy , the region of integration over transverse momenta of virtual quarks and gluons can be regarded for every feynman graph contributing to @xmath43 as a sum of sub - regions so that in every sub - region only one virtual particle ( quark or gluon ) has the minimal transverse momentum @xmath77 .",
    "we call such particles the softest ones although their longitudinal momenta can be large ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is essential that integrating over @xmath77 one includes @xmath75 as the lowest limit",
    ". the softest particle can be either a gluon or a quark . when the softest particle is a quark , dl contributions come from the sub - region where another quark has the same transverse momentum , so that there appears a @xmath78-channel intermediate state with a soft quark pair . therefore in order to keep the dl contributions , one must consider @xmath43 as convolution of two amplitudes connected by the softest quark pair , each quark with the minimal transverse momentum @xmath77 , as depicted by graph ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ equation ] .",
    "the first amplitude appearing in graph ( b ) ( the upper blob ) is the compton forward scattering @xmath43 and the second one ( the lower blob ) is the forward scattering amplitude of quarks @xmath79 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the particle with the minimal @xmath77 is a virtual gluon , it can be factorized out of the amplitude with the dl accuracy @xcite .",
    "this means , in particular , that the propagator of such softest gluon is attached to external lines only , yielding zero result .",
    "having added the born contribution to the convolution graph ( b ) in fig ,  3 , we arrive at the equation of the bethe - salpeter type for @xmath43 . as usual the bethe - salpeter equation relates @xmath43 with on - shell quarks ( lhs of equation in fig .",
    "[ equation ] ) to @xmath43 with off - shell quarks ( rhs of fig .  [ equation ] ) . however , all amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ equation ] are actually on - shell because the virtual quark pair in fig .",
    "[ equation ] has the minimal transverse momentum @xmath77 .",
    "integrations in blobs imply @xmath77 to be a new ir cut - off and , therefore , a new mass scale for these blobs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us note that in the dglap approach such softest quark pair is always in the lowest ladder rung because of the dglap ordering : in this approach all ladder transverse momenta @xmath80 are indeed ordered as    @xmath81    the numeration running from the bottom of the ladder to the top .",
    "equation  ( [ order ] ) shows that only the integration over @xmath82 has @xmath75 as the lower limit .",
    "the lower limits for other @xmath83 with @xmath84 are expressed through the other transverse momenta .",
    "therefore the small-@xmath0 dglap equations correspond to the case where the quark scattering amplitude in graph ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ equation ] is considered in the born approximation . as is well known , the ordering of eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) corresponds to accounting for @xmath85 without considering terms @xmath86 not accompanied by logarithms of @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "as we investigate the small-@xmath0 region , we have to lift this ordering , allowing for the transverse momentum of quarks in any ladder rung to reach the lowest limit @xmath87 .",
    "obviously , this increases the region of integration over @xmath80 .",
    "then , a quark pair with minimal @xmath77 appears in any rung of the ladder feynman graph .",
    "the convolution of the amplitudes depicted in graph ( b ) prompts us to apply the mellin transform for solving this equation .",
    "however , to respect the signatures of @xmath73 it is more convenient to use the asymptotic form of the sommerfeld - watson ( sw ) transform ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath88    where    @xmath89    is the signature factor , for which this transform differs from that of mellin .",
    "the inverse transform to eq .",
    "( [ mellin ] ) is    @xmath90    where @xmath91 .",
    "the small-@xmath0 region corresponds effectively to the dominance of the small-@xmath92 region in eq .",
    "( [ mellin ] ) . expanding @xmath93 into series in @xmath92 and retaining the first terms in eq .",
    "( [ mellin ] , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we see that in the small-@xmath0 ( or small-@xmath92 ) region    @xmath96    we need to calculate @xmath97 only to obtain the structure functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "eq.([fmi ] ) ) . to do",
    "this one can apply the sw transform of eq .",
    "( [ mellin ] ) to the equation depicted in fig .",
    "[ equation ] and then differentiate it with respect to @xmath98 . on the other hand the born amplitude does not depend on @xmath75 and therefore vanishes when differentiated with respect to @xmath75 .",
    "then , observing that    @xmath99    corresponds to    @xmath100    for the amplitudes @xmath97 , where we have defined @xmath101 , and differentiating the rhs of the equation depicted in fig .",

    "@xcite , where the latter equation was obtained for @xmath104 .",
    "the only difference now is that iree ( [ eqir ] ) involves also the negative signature amplitude @xmath105 of forward quark - quark scattering instead of @xmath106 only . the solutions to eq .",

    "the first one is an arbitrary factor @xmath108 , essentially of a non - perturbative nature , which can be fixed by comparison with the data .",
    "the other unknown quantity @xmath109 can be specified by constructing and solving the iree for the amplitude @xmath79 of forward scattering of quarks .",
    "the equation for @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "the first two terms in the rhs look similar to the equation in fig .",
    "[ equation ] .",
    "indeed , the rhs consists of the born contribution depicted by graph ( a ) , the convolution of two quark scattering amplitudes ( graph ( b ) ) , the intermediate quarks having minimal transverse momenta @xmath77 , and a new contribution depicted by graphs ( c ) - ( f ) . for symmetry ,",
    "the contributions of graphs ( c ) and ( d ) are equal .",
    "the same is true for graphs ( e ) and ( f ) .",
    "all these graphs correspond to the case where the particle with the minimal transverse momentum @xmath77 is a gluon .",
    "the propagators of such soft gluons are attached to external lines because by integrating over the soft gluon momenta the most singular dl contributions come from the region where each soft virtual gluon is factorized out ( see e.g. ref .",
