    "rotation powered pulsar wind nebulae ( rpwn ) contain an isolated neutron star that drives a relativistic wind of particles into the ambient medium fueling an extended non - thermal emission region .",
    "+ the rotational energy of the neutron star is partially transformed into a highly relativistic wind of particles that is driven   into the ambient medium which   ( for middle aged rpwn ) is potentially modified by the reverse shock of the supernova remnant ejecta @xcite . a relativistic standing shock forms at a distance of typically @xmath0  cm to the central object and",
    "is believed to be the site of particle acceleration . among the possible ways of accelerating particles ,",
    "the well - known fermi acceleration mechanism has been considered to be a good candidate to explain the broad band power law distribution of the pair plasma in the downstream region .",
    "the ultrarelativistic wind with bulk lorentz factors of about @xmath1 terminates in a standing shock .",
    "the details of fermi - type shock acceleration in relativistic shocks has become recently a matter of controversy .",
    "while initial calculations @xcite indicated an efficient acceleration of particles following a universal power law type distribution , recent calculations have revealed substantial difficulties in accelerating particles to form a power law type particle distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover , detailed particle in cell distributions of shocks forming in flows with different magnetization have not been found to show any acceleration at all @xcite .",
    "while the issue is currently not settled , it appears worthwhile to consider alternative mechanisms to explain the acceleration of particles in ultrarelativistic shocks .",
    "an interesting alternative has been proposed by hoshino et al .",
    "@xcite , and arons & tavani @xcite in which in the downstream region gyrating , reflecting ions dissipate energy in magnetosonic waves which are absorbed by the pair - plasma to form a power law type spectrum",
    ". an important prediction of this model is that the maximum energy achievable in this type of acceleration is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 indicates the mass and @xmath4 the charge of the ions .",
    "while the archetypal rpwn , the crab nebula is a well studied example of a young ( @xmath5  kyrs ) rpwn which is sufficiently bright to measure the emitted power over an extremely wide energy range , similar detailed energy spectra for middle aged rpwn ( @xmath6  kyrs ) have not been obtained . the hard x - ray band",
    "( @xmath7  kev ) and the gamma - ray band ( @xmath8  mev ) are crucial observational windows to explore the acceleration of particles : in this energy range , we expect predominantly synchrotron emission of accelerated electrons . moreover , the life - time of the electrons emitting in the hard x - ray band is rather limited @xmath9 with @xmath10 . in general",
    ", we expect unpulsed hard x - rays to be emitted only in a very confined volume close to the aceleration site .",
    "the _ integral _  instruments have been used to observe regularly a large fraction of the galactic disk . a rather small fraction of a few per cent of the sources detected by the _ integral _  satellite",
    "have been identified to be young and middle - aged rpwn ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : pulsarparameter ] ) .",
    "we have analysed part of the archival data focussing on rpwn which have been detected as tev plerions .",
    "in addition to already known _ integral _  sources , we find evidence for hard x - ray emission from the newly discovered `` kookaburra '' tev plerion g313.3 + 0.6 .    here",
