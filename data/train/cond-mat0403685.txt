    "magnetic multilayers ( mml ) heterostructures of alternating ferromagnetic layers and non - magnetic spacers have attracted attention in the last decades because of their implications both for fundamental research and technological applications .",
    "the most remarkable property of these systems is the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) measured for a parallel / antiparallel configuration of the magnetic moments belonging to different layers in the presence of an external magnetic filed @xcite .",
    "the gmr effect is related to the spin dependent scattering but the detailed mechanism is still subject of intense investigations .",
    "one of the first attempts to explain the gmr effect was based on the ballistic approach @xcite .",
    "soon it became obvious that the band structure description is very important for the realistic description of gmr .",
    "a considerable number of attempts have been made to include the electronic structure in diffusive regime @xcite . in order to consider the spin dependent scattering due to the interface",
    ", these calculations were based on the coherent potential approximation . however , all these calculations overestimate the experimental values for the gmr effect . on the other hand band structure calculations",
    "allows the evaluation of the fermi velocities which can be used to estimate the spin dependent relaxation - times @xcite . the semiclassical approach used in the calculation of the conductivity overestimate also",
    ", the experimental gmr values @xcite . one of the most advanced technique in the _ ab initio _ theories of electric transport in solid systems , is offered by the kubo - greenwood formalism . a comprehensive overview of this technique applied for systems with reduced dimension is discussed by weinberger @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrate that the correlations effects might play an important role in the realistic description of transport properties .",
    "our approach is motivated by the fact that the @xmath0 transition metal elements , components of the magnetic multilayers , show significant correlation effects .",
    "in general , spin - polarized lda band structure calculation gives an adequate description of the ferromagnetic ground state for the most of metals but , on the other hand , there are obvious evidences of essentially many - body features in photoemission spectra of fe @xcite , co @xcite , and ni @xcite,@xcite . the 6 ev satellite in ni ,",
    "broadening of the arpes features due to quasiparticle damping , narrowing of the @xmath1-band , essential change of spin polarization near the fermi level are some examples .",
    "it is obvious that these effects can be equally important also for magnetic multilayers and other heterostructures containing transition metals .",
    "we focus on the band structure of the perfect ( 001 ) fcc @xmath2 and ( 001 ) bcc fe@xmath3/cr@xmath4 supercells . it was found experimentally that values of gmr are @xmath5 in fe / cr multilayers @xcite and @xmath6 in co / cu multilayers @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons why the above multilayers are highly magnetorezistve is that they contain ferromagnetic 3d metals which should have a pronounced spin asymmetry in their conductivity due to the presence of the exchange split @xmath1-bands .",
    "perhaps the crucial factors for obtaining high values of gmr are the band matching and the lattice matching between the ferromagnetic and non - magnetic metals @xcite .",
    "these two conditions are almost perfectly satisfied in co / cu and fe / cr multilayers .",
    "thin films of co grow in the fcc structure with the lattice parameter of @xmath7 , which is only @xmath8 less than the lattice parameter of @xmath9 in fcc cu .",
    "both fe and cr have the bcc structure and their lattice parameters are almost identical : @xmath10 for fe and @xmath11 for cr . on the other hand it was experimentally demonstrated that the magnetic multilayers grown epitaxially shows an enhancement of the electronic contribution to the low temperature specific heat @xcite which can be an evidence of correlation effects .",
    "indeed , this enhancement can not be reproduced in the standard electronic band structure calculations @xcite , probably because of the neglecting of many - body effects .",
    "it is our aim to check whether the correlation effects considered in the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite approach can lead to an essential renormalization of the density of state at the fermi level @xmath12 .",
    "we performed calculations based on the lda+dmft scheme @xcite .",
    "the present realistic lda+dmft method @xcite is based on the so - called exact muffin - tin orbitals ( emto ) method @xcite within a screened kkr @xcite , frozen core together with the selfconsistent local spin density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the correlation effects are treated in the framework of dmft @xcite , with the spin - polarized t - matrix plus the fluctuation exchange ( t - flex ) approximation for the quantum impurity solver @xcite .    in the calculations for the @xmath13 system we considered a tetragonal supercell formed by 16 layers , each layer containg one atom , with an interlayer distance corresponding to the fcc @xmath14 lattice constant @xmath15 .",
    "the supercell structure used for the study of the @xmath16 system is presented in fig .",
    "[ fecr_str ] .",
    "as can be seen the optimization ( relaxation ) of the atomic layers are neglected , the interlayer distances correspond to the value of the bulk bcc fe @xmath17 .",

    "@xmath18 atoms , or interface atoms , are denoted by blue sphere .",
    "the central , @xmath19 atoms are indicated by a light blue color . in the picture representing the structure fig .",
    "[ fecr_str ] three extra fe layers : @xmath20 belonging to the next unit cell were introduced .",
    "interface @xmath21 layers are indicated by green , respectively yellow color spheres , meanwhile the central @xmath22 layer is denoted by red sphere . in the calculations",
    "the same atomic sphere radius was considered for fe and cr in the fe / cr , and similarly the radii for co and cu atoms were chosen the same for the co / cu system .",
    "the @xmath23 , and @xmath0 states are included for the co , cu and fe valence electrons . in order to calculate the charge density we integrate the green function along a contour on the complex energy plane which extends from the bottom of the band up to the fermi level @xcite , using 30 energy points .",
    "for the brillouin zone integration we sum up a number of 567 k - points for the @xmath13 system and 839 k points for the @xmath24 respectively . a cutoff of @xmath25 for the multipole expansion of the charge density and a cutoff of @xmath26 for the wave function was used .",
    "the perdew - wand @xcite parameterization of the local density approximation to the exchange correlation potential was used .",
    "although the lattice mismatch and relaxation have been shown to influence the magnetic properties @xcite we neglect this effect .",
    "we will first discuss the correlation effects on bulk fcc co , and afterwards investigate the co / cu multilayer .",

    "this asymmetry in the dos is the source of gmr in magnetic co / cu multilayers .",
    "the most important feature of the cobalt dos is that the fermi level lies above the top of the @xmath1-band for the majority spin electrons .    for the lsda+dmft calculations a value of the average coulomb interaction @xmath28 ev",

    "recent experiments on fe / cr trilayers showed the existence of magnetic fluctuations @xcite . even though the magnetic excitation were attributed to structural and magnetic disorder in the vicinity of both fe / cr interface @xcite",
    ", results presented in this paper suggest that electron - electron interactions give rise to magnetic excitations , which are common features in 3d transition metals systems .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the enhanced dos at the fermi level , having a many - body correlation origin , can play an important role in the gmr , since this dos enhancement is strongly spin - dependent .",
