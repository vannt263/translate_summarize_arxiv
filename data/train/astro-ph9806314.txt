    "observations performed in the last decade or so , particularly in the ir regime , have clearly demonstrated that dust is one of the most important components of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , containing a large fraction of heavy elements ejected from stars .",
    "this paper is mainly concerned with the influence of dust grains on the transfer of radiation emitted by stellar systems .",
    "basically dust absorbs and scatters photons , mostly at wavelengths @xmath0 @xmath1 m and returns to the radiation field the subtracted energy in the form of ir photons .",
    "the resulting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is often substantially changed and in many relevant cases radically modified .    not surprisingly , dust reprocessing of the optical ",
    "uv photons emitted by stars into the infrared regime turns out to be particularly severe in galaxies undergoing massive episodes of star formation , which preferentially occur within dense molecular clouds .",
    "indeed dust could affect galaxy evolution because it modifies the physical and chemical conditions of the ism .",
    "in particular star formation is at least favored by the presence of dust , which shields dense clouds from stellar uv radiation and keeps them to temperatures low enough to allow the onset of gravitational instability .",
    "the sed of normal star  forming disk  like galaxies is also affected by dust , mainly associated with the diffuse ism and with the envelopes of evolved asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . as for early type systems",
    ", it has been often suggested that the first episode of massive star ",
    "formation could be essentially hidden to optical searches due to dust reprocessing , since their ism might have been metal enriched on a very short timescale , the lifetime of the first generation of massive stars ( franceschini et al.1994 and references therein ; cimatti et al .",
    "even local quiescent elliptical galaxies exhibit infrared emission ( e.g.  jura 1986 ; bally & thronson 1989 ; knapp et al .",
    "1989 ; roberts et al .",
    "1991 ) and visual dust obscuration ( e.g.  veron  cetty & veron 1988 ; kim 1989 ; goudfrooij et al.1994 ) , arising in part from dust grains continuosly formed in dusty outflows from agb stars ( tsai & mathews 1996 ; bressan , granato , & silva 1998 ) , as well as molecular line emission ( e.g.  gordon 1990 ; roberts et al .  1991",
    "; lees et al .  1991 ) .",
    "overall , a direct comparison of the luminosity functions of galaxies in the optical and in the far  ir shows that , locally , about 30% of starlight is dust  reprocessed .",
    "at least three different dusty environments must be taken into account in order to properly understand the uv to sub ",
    "mm properties of galaxies : ( i ) dust in interstellar h i clouds heated by the general interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) of the galaxy ( the ` cirrus ' component ) , ( ii ) dust associated with star forming molecular clouds and h ii regions and ( iii ) circumstellar dust shells produced by the windy final stages of stellar evolution .",
    "these environments have different importance in different galactic systems at various evolutionary stages .    despite this , in many papers dealing with the spectrophotometric evolution of galaxies the radiative processes occurring in a dusty interstellar medium were originally neglected ( e.g.  bruzual & charlot 1993 and leitherer & heckman 1995 , the former the most adopted one to interpret data on different galaxy types , the latter appositely built for starburst galaxies )",
    ". indeed their codes are nowadays commonly used together with some prescription to approximate the effects of the ism . in other cases ( e.g.  guiderdoni & rocca  volmerange 1987 ; mazzei , de zotti , & xu 1994 ; lanon & rocca  volmerange 1996 ;",
    "fioc & rocca  volmerange 1997 ) , the effects of dust are included only partially and/or with substantial simplifications .",
    "for instance often extinction is considered but thermal reradiation is not , or scattering is neglected , or not all the relevant dusty environments are considered , or optically thin emission is assumed , or a unrealistic geometry is adopted . those works facing a complete computation of the radiative transfer through a dusty medium , do not include it in the more general framework of galaxy evolution , but are instead interested either in the interpretation of single objects ( e.g.krgel & siebenmorgen 1994 ) or in understanding the effects of dust geometry on the extinction of the emerging spectrum ( e.g.  bruzual , magris , & calvet 1988 ; witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ; cimatti et al.1997 ; wise & silva 1996 ; bianchi , ferrara , & giovanardi 1996 ; gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ) .",
    "the inclusion of dust effects into spectrophotometric codes leads to many difficulties . while the integrated photometric properties of an hypothetical dust ",
    "free galaxy are geometry independent , dust introduces a strong dependence on the distribution of both stars and ism .",
    "moreover the optical properties of dust grains and their dependence on environmental conditions have not yet been fully explored and understood .",
    "the ensuing uncertainty may only be parametrized to some extent .",
    "the effects of scattering , absorption and emission of grains , which may not be in radiative equilibrium with the radiation field , complicate the solution of the integro  differential transfer equation in a complex geometry .",
    "nonetheless a more realistic and complete computation of the spectrophotometric galaxy models including dust is required , since neglecting the complexity of the dust effects can lead to erroneous estimates of many interesting quantities such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "also , the estimate of the age of a galaxy through the fit of its broadband sed is hampered by the degeneracy between the colors of an old galaxy and those of an extinguished young galaxy ( e.g.  cimatti et al.1997 ) , further complicating the well known age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy .",
    "we have therefore developed chemo ",
    "spectrophotometric self ",
    "consistent galactic models including dust .",
    "three different dusty environments are considered : envelopes of agb stars , molecular star ",
    "forming clouds and diffuse ism ; the dust model is comprehensive of normal big grains , small thermally fluctuating grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) molecules ; for each grain family , the appropriate computation of absorption and reemission is performed .",
    "the models are suited to simulate galaxies of any hubble type , in different evolutionary stages , since we include the possibility of different geometrical distributions both for stars and gas .",
    "the complete radiative transfer equation is numerically solved whenever necessary .",
    "the many parameters and uncertainties introduced by the presence of dust can be constrained only by means of the multiband approach pursued in this paper , where the spectrophotometric properties of galaxies are consistently reproduced from the uv to the sub ",
    "mm , i.e.  taking into account extinction at short wavelengths and the consequent thermal emission in the ir regime .",
    "the combination of observations from hst , keck , iso and ground  based optical , ir and sub  mm telescopes already provided several objects at significant redshift with spectral information on this large @xmath2 range .",
    "their number will increase after the completion of iso surveys , and will burst when sirft , first , planck surveyor and ngst will operate .",
    "in this paper we present the model and we use it to study local galaxies . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will exploit it to study the cosmic evolution of different types of galaxies .",
    "we divide the problem of estimating the sed of a galaxy at age @xmath3 , including dust effects , in two steps : ( 1 ) the history of the star formation rate @xmath4 , of the initial mass function ( imf ) , of the metallicity @xmath5 and of the residual gas fraction @xmath6 is determined and then ( 2 ) the integrated sed of the galaxy is predicted taking into account all the stars and the gas present at @xmath3 .",
    "when the effects of dust are neglected , step ( 2 ) simply involves a sum of all the spectra of stars . in our case",
    "we have instead to introduce a specific geometry for gas and stars , and then to compute the radiative transfer of the radiation emitted by the stars and the dust .",
    "the purpose of the present work is mainly to develop a general procedure for step ( 2 ) .",
    "step ( 1 ) includes a number of possible choices which can be easily interfaced to our code in order to describe the evolution of the sed .",
    "the chemical evolution is a preliminary process in our code .",
    "we summarize here the main aspects of the code , which basically follows the guidelines given by tantalo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the code describes one  zone open models including the infall of primordial gas ( @xmath7 ) , in order to simulate the collapse phase of galaxy formation and , when required by the astrophysical situation under study , galactic winds .",
    "the adopted sfr is a schmidt  type law , i.e. proportional to some power ( between 1 and 2 ) of the available gas mass : @xmath8 . for starburst galaxies we add to the general smooth sfr one or more bursts of star formation .",
    "as for the imf we used the usual salpeter law : @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . the upper limit of the mass range is fixed to @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "this kind of chemical evolution models has been successfully tested against nearby spheroidal galaxies , and also well reproduces the properties of different types of galaxies with appropriate choices of the parameters ( e.g. a quiet spiral  type evolution is well mimicked with a low value of @xmath13 and/or a long infall time scale , see matteucci 1996 for a thorough review ) .",
    "the library of isochrones for the simple stellar populations ( ssp ) , the building  blocks of galaxy models , is based on the padua stellar models ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) , with a major difference , consisting in the computation of the effects of dusty envelopes around agb stars .",
    "the ssps span a wide range in age , from 1 myr to 20 gyr , and in metallicity , @xmath14 , to realistically reproduce the mix of age and composition of the stellar content of galaxies .",
    "the inclusion of a wide range of metallicity is imposed by the aim of comparing model estimates to the excellent data available even for young high redshift galaxies .    the spectral synthesis technique , for the starlight alone , consists in summing up the spectra of each stellar generation , provided by the ssp of the appropriate age and metallicity , weighted by the sfr at time of the stars birth ( e.g.  bressan , chiosi , & fagotto 1994 ) .",
    "effects of dust in the envelopes of evolved stars are usually neglected in the synthesis of a composite population .",
    "this is not justified for intermediate age population clusters , whose brightest tracers are agb stars , and/or in a wide  wavelength synthesis approach . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "we computed new isochrones and ssps in which , along the agb , a suitable dusty envelope is assumed to surround the star .",
    "for this envelope the radiative transfer is solved by means of the code described by granato & danese ( 1994 ) .",
    "the envelope parameters , in particular its optical thickness , which is straightforwardly linked to the mass - loss rate and to the expansion velocity , are derived as a function of basic stellar parameters ( mass , luminosity , radius , and metallicity ) combining hydrodynamic model results and empirical relations . a detailed description of the adopted procedure can be found in bressan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .      as already pointed out , the dust effects on seds depend on the relative distribution of stars and dust .",
    "the assumed geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figcar ] .",
    "the galaxy is approximated as a system having azimuthal symmetry as well as planar symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "we take into account three components : i ) star forming molecular clouds complexes , hereafter mcs , comprising dusty gas in a dense phase , h ii regions and very young stars embedded in it ( young stellar objects yso ) ; ii ) stars already escaped from these dense clouds ( henceforth _ free stars _ ) ; iii ) diffuse gas ( cirrus ) .",
    "we work in spherical coordinates @xmath15 .",
    "the densities of the three components @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 respectively , depend on @xmath19 and @xmath20 through analytical laws . in the following , unless otherwise explicitly stated , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have identical spatial dependence . in order to describe disk",
    " like galaxies , we use a double exponential of the distance from the polar axis @xmath21 and from the equatorial plane @xmath22 : @xmath23 in the code the scale lengths @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be independently set for the three components , but in the models presented in this paper ( sec.[seccompa ] ) we simply adopt identical values for them . in other words",
    "we use two adjustable parameters when describing disk  like galaxies : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . observations within our galaxy suggest @xmath28 kpc . as a reference the _ e_-folding scale length is related to the absolute magnitude by @xmath29 ( i m et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "in the case of spheroidal systems we adopt for both stars and dust spherical symmetric distributions with king profile : @xmath30 extended up to the tidal radius @xmath31 .",
    "this truncation radius is required in king models since @xmath32 , the mass contained within @xmath19 , diverges as @xmath33 .",
    "our results are not very sensitive to its precise choice , thus we simply adopted the standard value @xmath34 .",
    "as for the stellar component we simply set @xmath35 .",
    "it has been suggested that the core radius @xmath36 correlates with the luminosity ( bingelli , sandage , & tarenghi 1984 ) : @xmath37    the distribution of dust in spheroidal systems is poorly known , but it has been suggested that @xmath38 with @xmath39 ( froehlich 1982 ; witt et al .  1992 ; wise & silva 1996 ) , i.e.@xmath40 . in other words",
    "the dust distribution seems to be less concentrated than that of stars . in particular",
    "an additional cool component located in the outer parts has been invoked to explain iras observations ( tsai & mathews 1996 ) .",
    "the volume emissivity ( ergs @xmath41 s@xmath42 ster@xmath42 @xmath42 ) of the galaxy at each point is the sum of three terms , arising respectively from the three components listed above : @xmath43 in the following sections we will describe how these quantities , as well as the specific flux measured by an external observer , are computed .",
    "a preliminary stride is to define the optical properties of dust .",
    "once the geometrical arrangement is specified , the effects of dust on radiative transfer depend on physical and chemical properties of grains , which affect the way they absorb and emit photons .",
    "it is expected and observationally well established that these properties are functions of the particular environment in which grains happen to live .",
    "several populations may be distinguished ( see dorschner & henning 1995 for a review ):",
    "( i ) stellar outflow dust ( further subdivided into the two chemical subgroups of carbon rich and oxygen rich dust ) ; ( ii ) dust in the diffuse ism ; ( iii ) dust in molecular clouds and dust around ysos . as for stellar outflow dust",
    ", we refer to the treatment of bressan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) mentioned above . here",
    "we discuss our choices for the other two dusty components of the model galaxy .",
    "although a lot of efforts have been devoted to derive a so called _ standard _ model for dust in the diffuse ism , its precise composition remains controversial .",
    "significant clues can be derived from observations .",
    "the prominent features observed in its spectrum at 9.7 and 18 @xmath1 m indicate the presence of silicate grains . by converse ,",
    "the origin of the 2175 feature is somewhat debated , though graphite still stands as the most attractive solution ( see mathis 1990 ) .",
    "the emission bands in the 3 - 13 @xmath1 m region indicate the presence of pahs ( puget , lger , & boulanger 1985 ) , which together with small thermally fluctuating grains contribute also to produce the warm mid  ir cirrus emission .",
    "therefore we included these components in our diffuse dust model .",
    "we adopted the same mixture even for mcs , for which the information are scanty , only decreasing the fraction of pah molecules ( see below ) .",
    "the optical properties of silicate and graphite grains have been computed by laor & draine ( 1993 ) for spherical shapes using mie theory , the rayleigh ",
    "gans approximation and geometric optics .",
    "in particular we used the cross sections of graphite and silicate grains computed by b.t .",
    "draine for 81 grain sizes from 0.001 to 10 @xmath1 m in logarithmic steps @xmath44 , and made available via anonymous ftp at _",
    "astro.princeton.edu_.    in order to get the overall radiative properties of the dust mixture , the abundance and the size distribution of grains must be specified .",
    "we started from the distribution proposed by draine & lee ( 1984 , henceforth dl ) , which is tuned on the optical  uv extinction law of the galactic diffuse ism . on the other hand dl pointed out that their model displays significant discrepancies with extinction data above 2 @xmath1 m , and that these discrepancies are not surprising , since observations at longer @xmath2 tend to sample lines of sight through denser clouds , where grain population may differ from that present in more diffuse regions .",
    "a more severe limitation of dl model is that the mid  ir ( mir ) cirrus emission at wavelengths @xmath4560 @xmath1 m is not reproduced ( fig .",
    "[ figesci ] ) , because grains are always large enough to maintain a low temperature thermal equilibrium in the general isrf .",
    "this emission requires reprocessing of the field by particles , very small grains and/or pah molecules , reaching temperatures higher than those attained with equilibrium heating ( e.g.  puget et al .",
    "1985 ; draine & anderson 1985 ; dwek et al.1997 ) .",
    "this requirement can be matched by decreasing the lower limit of the graphite grain distribution . since these grains must be more numerous than the simple extrapolation of the dl power law , a break to a steeper power law is introduced below @xmath46 .",
    "these adjustments to the dl model enhance the mir cirrus emission , but tend to degrade the agreement with the observed extinction law in the optical  uv region . however a reasonable compromise can be found . for graphite grains we adopted the following size distribution",
    ": @xmath47 with @xmath48  , @xmath49 @xmath1 m , @xmath50  , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54h . as for silicate grains",
    ", we maintained the same size distribution as dl .",
    "as a result , 282 atoms per million h ( ppm hereafter ) of c are locked in dust grains .    in the code",
    "the size distributions have been discretized in 20 logarithmic bins following the prescriptions given by draine & malhotra ( 1993 ) . once the bathing radiation field is specified , the emissivity of grains with radius @xmath55   is computed assuming that they achieve thermal equilibrium , so that all grains of a given composition and radius emit as gray bodies at a single temperature . below this limit a temperature distribution for each size bin and composition",
    "is computed following guhathakurta & draine ( 1989 ) , and then the emissivity is obtained by integrating over this distribution .    to model the observed ir emission occurring in bands at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3 @xmath1 m we include also a population of planar pahs .",
    "the optical  uv absorption cross ",
    "section @xmath56 is reported in fig .",
    "[ figpah ] .",
    "this has been obtained by averaging the cross sections of 6 different pah mixtures measured by lger et al.(1989 ) above 1200  , and smoothly joining the resulting mean curve to the coronene cross section below this limit .",
    "the same cross section is used to take into account the effects of pah on the extinction curve , assuming a vanishing albedo ( fig .",
    "[ figesci ] ) .",
    "dsert , boulanger , & puget ( 1990 ) have proposed an analytical description of @xmath56 derived from the observed interstellar extinction curve in the 12003300   range , under the assumption that these particles dominate its euv rise . on the other hand the extreme uv ( euv ) rise",
    "can be ascribed to small grains . actually using dl optical efficiencies ,",
    "the euv part of the extinction curve is produced by small grains .",
    "our @xmath56 rests on laboratory measurements and predicts , in the local interstellar radiation field , a pah absorption and subsequent ir emission lower by a factor @xmath57 with respect to the dsert et al.(1990 ) analytical approximation .    in order to compute the ir emission of pahs ,",
    "their heat capacity @xmath58 must be specified .",
    "a numerically convenient and accurate enough representation of the estimate given by lger , dhendecourt , & de fourneau ( 1989 ) is : @xmath59 where @xmath60 k$ ] and @xmath61 is the total number of atoms ( carbon and hydrogen ) in the molecule .",
    "we adopt a population of pahs with a distribution @xmath62 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "smaller molecules are easily destroyed by uv photons ( omont 1986 ) .",
    "this distribution is quite similar to those adopted by other authors ( dwek et al .",
    "1997 , dsert et al .",
    "astrophysical pahs are thought to be partially _ dehydrogenated _ : probably due to the large uv flux in the emission regions , some of the ch bonds , responsible for the 3.3 , 8.6 and 11.3 @xmath1 m bands , are broken .",
    "the number of h atoms in a molecule is thus written as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the number of hydrogen sites and @xmath67 is the h coverage .",
    "the relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath68 depends on the arrangements of hexagonal cycles in the molecule .",
    "the ratio @xmath69 is rather constant around 2 for laboratory pahs molecules , for which @xmath70 .",
    "however , the structure of typical interstellar pahs is likely closer to that of _ catacondensed _ pahs ( omont 1986 ) , which are the most compact and stable ones and have the general formula @xmath71 , i.e.  @xmath72 . for these quasi  circular molecules ,",
    "usually assumed to represent the gross features of interstellar pahs , the radius is given by @xmath73   if @xmath74 . with the above relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath68 the typical flux ratios observed in the ism between ch and cc bands ( mattila et al .",
    "1996 ) is fairly well reproduced by our pah model setting @xmath75    pahs emissivity was then computed following substantially the guidelines given by xu & de zotti ( 1989 ) in their equation ( 13 ) is wrong since their cross section already takes into account the two molecule surfaces .",
    "on the other hand the integration over solid angle yields a factor @xmath76 before @xmath77 in the same equation , which in conclusion should be multiplied by a factor @xmath78 on the rhs ] .",
    "the adopted abundances of pah molecules in the diffuse ism and in the mcs implies that 18 and 1.8 ppm of c are locked in this component respectively .",
    "indeed there are indications showing that in denser environments and/or in stronger uv radiation field the relative number of small particles is significantly diminished ( puget & lger 1989 ; kim & martin 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "in particular xu & de zotti ( 1989 ) concluded that pah molecules are less abundant by a factor @xmath79 in our galaxy star forming regions than in the diffuse gas .",
    "as apparent from fig .  [ figesci ] , this model reproduces reasonably well both the extinction from ir to uv and the whole cirrus emission .",
    "the model predicts an extinction below a few observational estimates at @xmath80 m by a factor @xmath79 . to account for this , rowan  robinson ( 1986 , 1992 ) introduced _ ad hoc _ modifications of the grain optical properties in his discretized models .",
    "we avoid in general this approach ( but see sec .",
    "[ seca220 ] ) mainly because these data have large uncertainties ( dl ) , as it is apparent from their scatter",
    ". moreover they refer to dusty environments for many respects different from the diffuse dust , which is instead the dominant contributor to the emission at @xmath81 100 @xmath1 m in our galaxy models .",
    "also it has been suggested that the silicate grain absorption in the sub ",
    "mm wavelength range may decline less steeply than @xmath82 ( agladze et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the adopted mixture , even taking into account the contribution of pah emission features , tends to underpredict the mir cirrus emission , in particular the shorter @xmath2 data .",
    "a larger quantity of small grains and/or pah molecules would improve the match with dirbe observations , but would also produce a large disagreement with observed uv  extinction ( dwek et al .",
    "we prefer to adopt a compromise more balanced toward the extinction law , since in our models and in most interesting cases the mir emission is in general dominated by warm dust in mcs rather than thermally fluctuating grains in the cirrus , whilst a good specification of the extinction properties is crucial .",
    "moreover , dirbe cirrus data at short wavelength could be affected by significant systematic effects ( dwek et al.1997 ) .",
    "the total ( i.e.  cirrus + mcs ) dust content of a galaxy ism depends on the residual gas and on dust  to  gas ratio @xmath83 .",
    "the residual gas mass is provided at each time step by the chemical evolution model ( see above ) .",
    "determinations of @xmath83 in our galaxy ism and in nearby objects range typically from 1/100 to 1/400 . for the purpose of this paper , where the model is compared only to galaxies in the local universe",
    ", we simply set @xmath84 , the standard value of dl model .",
    "however the code is thought to interpret data on objects in very different evolutionary stages , thus we need in general a recipe to scale @xmath83 when the chemical conditions in the ism where very different .",
    "we adopt the simplest assumption @xmath85 , with the proportionality constant adjusted to have @xmath84 for @xmath86 .",
    "a recent difficulty for models relying on populations of carbon  based grains , the so  called _ carbon crisis _ , is connected with the quite uncertain determination of cosmic abundance of this element .",
    "indeed these models were developed under the hypothesis that the measured solar system abundances ( either in meteorites or solar photosphere ) were also typical for the ism .",
    "for instance , dl as well as our model , requires 282 ppm of c in grains , assuming a graphite density of 2.26 gr @xmath41 .",
    "this is 55 % of the solar abundance which was adopted by dl as cosmic reference abundance ( but @xmath87 80 % of the more recent estimate in the solar system @xmath88 ppm quoted by anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "however in the last few years evidence has been accumulated that solar abundances may be not representative of the ism . in particular in young star photospheres carbon is found to be only @xmath89 ppm ( e.g.  snow & witt 1995 , 1996 ; gies & lambert 1992 ) .",
    "this , if really representative of the ism abundance , would put restrictions difficult to meet by carbon  based dust models ( sofia , cardelli , & savage 1994 ; cardelli et al .  1996 ; mathis 1996 ) , especially when taking into account that about 140 ppm seem to be in gas phase ( cardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) , leaving for dust only about 1/3 of the c required by the dl model .",
    "possible ways out have been suggested : for instance big grains could be porous , likely because they are built up by sticking of smaller ones ( mathis & whiffen 1989 ; mathis 1996 ) , or dust could be to some extent prevented to be incorporated into stars during their formation ( snow & witt 1996 ) .",
    "also the introduction of carbonaceous grains in a form other than graphitic ( amorphous carbon , possibly hydrogenated , or composite grains ) , the use of more complex size distribution than a simple power law , and an elongated grain shape tend to alleviate the c requirements ( mathis 1996 ; kim & martin , 1996 ) .    since these problems are still far from being clarified and our major concern is to obtain a good description of the absorption and emission properties of dust , we maintain by now a dl  type model , looking only for the minimum modifications required to obtain an acceptable overall match of the extinction curve from the uv to the far  ir and of the galactic cirrus emission .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the future this goal should be achieved with a more efficient use of the available cosmic carbon .",
    "the main effect of this on our spectrophotometric galaxy models will be a possible decrease of the required dust  to  gas ratio by a factor up to @xmath90 .",
    "as already remarked , to get the sed from 0.1 to 1000 @xmath1 m , we have to solve the transfer equation for the radiation in presence of dust in the case of molecular clouds and diffuse ism .      in the galaxy",
    "virtually all the star formation activity resides in molecular clouds .",
    "maps of co and other tracers , show that mcs are non - uniform , highly structured objects , containing density - enhanced regions , the cores , wherein star formation actually occurs .",
    "this implies the clustering of young stars at different locations inside giant molecular clouds , as confirmed by infrared imaging .",
    "the first evolutionary stages are hidden at optical wavelengths and a significant fraction , if not all , of the energy of young stellar objects is reprocessed by dust and radiated in the ir , only a minor fraction being reradiated as recombination lines . the powerful stellar winds and outflows , and the ionizing flux from massive stars , all contribute to the destruction of the molecular clouds in a time scale comparable to the lifetime of ob stars , @xmath91 yr .",
    "thus stars gradually get rid of their parent gas and become visible at optical wavelengths .",
    "the typical dust densities in these objects are so high that even ir photons are self absorbed , thus to compute the emitted sed the radiative transfer equation must be solved .",
    "the complex evolution depicted above is simulated as follows .",
    "a fraction @xmath92 of the model gas mass @xmath93 at @xmath3 is ascribed to the dense phase under discussion in this section .",
    "recent estimates in our galaxy suggest that half of the hydrogen mass is molecular h@xmath94 , mainly in clouds with diameters @xmath95 10 pc .",
    "the molecular gas @xmath96 is then sub - divided into spherical clouds of assigned mass and radius , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which may range in the typical observed intervals @xmath99 and @xmath100 pc respectively .",
    "it is then supposed that each generation of stars , represented in our scheme by a ssp , is born within the cloud and progressively escapes it .",
    "this is mimicked by linearly decreasing the fraction @xmath101 of ssp energy radiated inside the cloud with its age @xmath102 : @xmath103 the model parameter @xmath104 introduced by this relation sets the fraction of starlight that can escape the starbursting region .",
    "the starlight locked up inside the cloud is approximated as a single central source .",
    "the cloud optical depth is fixed by the cloud mass and radius and by the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the emerging spectrum is obtained by solving the radiative transfer through the cloud with the code described by granato & danese ( 1994 ) .",
    "the distribution of stars in real gmcs implies a dust temperature distribution with many hot spots and cooler regions randomly distributed .",
    "a complete discussion of the effects of different approximations in this complex geometrical situation , including the single central source adopted here , can be found in krgel & siebenmorgen ( 1994 , see in particular their fig .",
    "an obvious drawback of our approach is an overestimate of the amount of very hot dust around the source , with respect to the more realistic approximation in which the stars are split in many sources at different locations . on the other hand",
    "the approximation of a central point source is not much different from the ir spectrum predicted by a full treatment with hot spots , if the emission from the whole cloud is considered ( krgel & siebenmorgen 1994 ) .",
    "since the treatment of many hot spots in the cloud would introduce many other geometrical parameters and would slow down considerably our code due to the loss of symmetry , we simply treat the maximum temperature @xmath105 of the grains at the inner edge as a parameter , summarizing in some way the geometrical parameters which would result in a lower true maximum temperature : lowering the grain sublimation temperature produces a lower average temperature with a less opaque cloud .",
    "this brings the overall spectrum very close to that predicted with a proper treatment of the hot spots .",
    "it is anyway interesting to note that gordon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that their _ shell geometry _",
    ", similar to that adopted here , is suited to explain the observed optical and uv properties of starburst galaxies , while the _ dusty geometry _ , in which dust and stars share the same spatial distribution , is not , even allowing for clumpiness .    for typical values of the relevant parameters our model predicts ir spectra of star forming regions peaking around 4060 @xmath1 m ( in a @xmath106 plot ) , depending on the optical depth , with a rather steep decrease at longer wavelengths .",
    "we found that this behavior reproduces quite well the typical range of ir spectra of galactic ysos , h ii , and star forming regions ( e.g.  rowan  robinson 1979 ; ward - thompson & robson 1990 ; menshchikov & henning 1996 ) .",
    "for instance in fig .",
    "[ figw49a ] the observed sed of w49a , a huge star  forming region composed of h ii regions and giant molecular clouds , is compared with the spectrum of the mc component we use in the fit of the overall sed of arp 220 .",
    "indeed we think that this ultraluminous infrared galaxy is a good benchmark for our mcs model , having an ir spectrum dominated by this component ( see section [ seca220 ] ) .      before escaping the galaxy the light arising from stellar populations and from molecular clouds",
    "interacts with the diffuse dust component .",
    "we adopt a simplified treatment of radiative transfer in the diffuse gas which ignores dust self  absorption and approximates the effects of optical  uv scattering by means of an effective optical depth , given by the geometrical mean of the absorption and scattering efficiencies @xmath107 ( rybicky & lightman 1979 , p. 36 ) . indeed the relatively low opacity of dust in the ir regime , where the dust emission occurs , implies that in most cases of interest the diffuse ism is transparent to its own photons .",
    "our approximation for combined scattering and absorption processes is rigorously applicable only to an infinite homogeneous medium and isotropic scattering .",
    "however we checked , by comparing our results with those obtained by witt et al .",

    "in other words the values found for @xmath98 depend on having set @xmath125 , as typical for giant molecular clouds in the galaxy , and @xmath98 could well be varied by a factor @xmath132 producing almost equivalent fits , provided @xmath97 would be adjusted to keep @xmath133 constant .        in the prototype starburst galaxy",

    "as for arp 220 , which properly belongs to the ulirg class , higher values @xmath212 are inferred from ir recombination lines , whereas our model predicts @xmath213 .",
    "the discrepancy is likely due to the uncertain large correction for ir extinction in this object .",
    "actually genzel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) use a screen obscuration with @xmath214 , while we find @xmath215 in mcs of this object .",
    "interestingly enough , the 15 ulirgs ( including arp 220 ) studied by genzel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , exhibit a median @xmath216 , larger by a factor of @xmath217 than that inferred for starburst galaxies .",
    "this result can be explained by larger obscurations or by a softer intrinsic lyman continuum , pointing to an imf less rich in massive stars or to an older starburst . in the models we used bursts began 0.05 gyr ago , but still rather active due to the large e  folding time @xmath218 gyr .",
    "it is worth noticing that our model does not account for the ionizing radiation converted into recombination lines , which are much less absorbed by dust than the lyman continuum . in the present version of the code",
    "the uv radiation can be only converted directly to ir photons through dust absorption .",
    "however the energy budget is not significantly affected , since the observed luminosity in recombination lines is only a few percent of the bolometric luminosity of starburst galaxies ( e.g.  genzel et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the observed uv emission at @xmath219   is crucial in determining the fraction of the ssps escaped from the parent molecular clouds . in our model",
    "the uv flux emerging from a single galaxy depends on the age @xmath104 after which a ssp starts to get out from the molecular cloud .",
    "the uv photons are affected also by absorption in the diffuse ism . in the case of m82 and",
    "arp 220 the measured uv flux is a tiny fraction of the bolometric luminosity ( see figg .",
    "[ figm82 ] and [ figa220 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the stars of the burst are still inside their parent clouds . indeed in these two objects",
    "@xmath104 is about equal to the time since burst ignition 0.05 gyr . by converse for ngc 6090",
    "the data show that the uv is not a negligible fraction of the total , implying for our model @xmath220 gyr . as a result",
    "stars with lifetime @xmath221 myr ( corresponding to @xmath222 ) are no more embedded within the clouds and contribute significantly to the isrf .",
    "actually the luminosity we ascribe to the diffuse cold component equals the warm one in ngc 6090 , whereas it is 25@xmath118 and 9@xmath118 for m82 and arp 220 respectively .",
    "calzetti , kinney , & storchi  bergmann ( 1994 ) computed the `` intrinsic depth '' of the 2175   dust absorption feature @xmath223 ( see their eq .",
    "23 ) in a number of starburst galaxies , finding that @xmath224 .",
    "for the three starbursts we find @xmath223 ranging from -0.15 to -0.08 .",
    "since the dust properties we adopt follows very well those of our galaxy , at least in these objects the relative weakness of the 2175   feature can be ascribed to the adopted geometry , without invoking possible variations of extinction curve .    in conclusion for starbursts , the spectral coverage from uv to submillimeter wavelengths allows a robust evaluation of the luminosity of stars involved in the bursts and of the general interstellar radiation field .",
    "the latter is contributed by the long - lived stellar populations and by the stars produced in the burst but old enough to get out from the original mcs .",
    "our model well describes the complexity of a starburst galaxy , and is flexible enough to reproduce the differences among them .",
    "it uses a reasonable number of parameters , which have a well defined physical meaning and compare favorably to values derived from observations other than broad band spectra .",
    "the seds of three spiral galaxies , namely m51 , m100 , and ngc 6946 , have been well reproduced by our model .",
    "an interesting result is the significantly lower @xmath104 in spirals with respect to starbursting objects .",
    "this derives from their smaller observed ratios @xmath225 . in the three spirals analyzed here",
    ", the newly born ssps quite soon get out from the parent clouds and significantly contribute to the heating of the diffuse dust .",
    "the expected contribution is larger for ngc 6946 and m100 than for m51 . as a consequence",
    ", a significant portion of the far  ir luminosity emitted by the diffuse dust ( almost all for ngc 6946 and m100 ) should be inserted in the budget to infer the sfr in spiral galaxies , in agreement with the findings of devereux et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and buat & xu ( 1996 ) .",
    "taking into account this , the sfrs derived from the fir luminosities , through the conversion suggested by kennicutt ( 1997 ) , are in very good agreement with those used by the model .",
    "the sfrs in our models , through the conversion of kennicutt ( 1997 ) @xmath226 = 1.26 \\times 10^{41 } \\times sfr[m_\\odot \\ , \\mbox{yr}^{-1}]$ ] , yield @xmath227 luminosities of 7.6 , 8.8 , and @xmath228 ergs s@xmath42 for m51 , m100 , and ngc 6946 respectively , to be compared with observed values ( kennicutt , tamblyn , & congdon 1994 , reported to our adopted distances ) of 4.9 , 5.0 , and @xmath229 ergs s@xmath42 . these lower values would imply an internal h@xmath172 extinction of @xmath230 , 0.6 , and 1.3 magnitudes in the three spirals , consistent with the average value 1.1 adopted by kennicutt ( 1997 ) , based on a comparison of free  free radio and h@xmath172 fluxes .    it is also worth noticing that masses in stars , dust , and gas derived by the model , as well as geometric parameters such as the disc scale length are in good agreement with independent estimates .",
    "our model includes the main physical aspects of star formation , stellar evolution , and dust absorption in spiral galaxies and allows a full exploitation of the broad band data in order to explain their present status and their past history .",
    "the model with a relatively small number of parameters is able to produce a very good fit to the template sed of giant elliptical galaxies ( see fig.[figeli ] ) .",
    "most excitement about spheroidal galaxies is related to their evolution .",
    "indeed it has been suggested that , during the initial phases of star formation , they might look very similar to local violent starbursts ( such as arp 220 ) , since the chemical enrichment and , as a consequence , the dust formation are very quick processes when sfrs are very high ( mazzei et al .",
    "1994 ; franceschini et al .",
    "this initial phase , if confined to high enough redshifts @xmath231 , is the most natural way to produce the total energy and the shape of the far  ir background ( franceschini et al.1991 ; franceschini et al .",
    "1994 ; burigana et al .",
    "1997 ) , which has been tentatively detected by puget et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and recently confirmed by hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fixsen et al .",
    "also we expect that in the iso extra deep surveys we may detect individual dusty spheroidal galaxies at substantial redshifts . our model is able to describe in detail the evolution of elliptical galaxies in all the relevant range of frequencies , and will be exploited to a comprehensive discussion of galaxy counts , related statistics , and astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "we showed that the model and the related numerical code are extremely efficient in deriving a wealth of information from broad band spectra of starburst and spiral galaxies .",
    "indeed , when seds from the uv to the sub ",
    "mm range are available , we are able to quantify the effects of dust reprocessing on observations , gaining information on very substantial quantities such as sfr , the imf and the past history of the galaxies . the model can be implemented in studies of local starburst and normal galaxies .",
    "it can also be used to trace back the history of the different classes of galaxies and , by confronting predictions and observations of number counts and redshift distributions in different bands , to understand their cosmological evolution . in particular we will use the model to investigate the role of dust during the early phase of galaxy formation , exploiting available and soon coming data on galaxy counts at wavelengths ranging from uv to radio bands .",
