    "this talk discusses the non - perturbative determination of @xmath6 , using lattice qcd as the non - perturbative definition of the theory and for its evaluation .",
    "one wants to relate @xmath7 ( conventionally at @xmath8 and in the @xmath9 scheme ) to experimental observables with negligible truncation errors from the use of  ( pt ) at intermediate scales .",
    "this is a very relevant task , since @xmath10 enters many important theory predictions , whether in lhc- or in flavor - physics .",
    "but it seems that it is sometimes overlooked that it is also a true challenge to achieve a good systematic precision .",
    "both the particle data group @xcite and the flavour lattice averaging group @xcite are therefore not just taking weighted averages of the individual determinations to arrive at their world averages .",
    "we start with a note on definitions of the qcd coupling and @xmath5-parameters which is needed in order to understand what can be said non - perturbatively and what is intrinsically perturbative .",
    "the standard is to use the @xmath11 renormalization scheme for qcd .",
    "order by order in the coupling it defines the relation between the bare coupling and the renormalized @xmath11 coupling .",
    "there is no general definition of this relation beyond this series , i.e. beyond pt .",
    "therefore , it is also hard to make firm statements about non - perturbative `` contributions '' or `` corrections '' .",
    "however , it is not hard to get around this conceptual and practical problem .",
    "one may start from some short - distance qcd observable with a perturbative expansion _ s ( ) = k^2_()[1 + c_1^s^2_()+  ] [ e : obsexp ] and define the coupling in the associated physical scheme via @xmath12 _ short - distance _ means that @xmath13 is defined in terms of fields concentrated within a 4-d region of linear size @xmath14 . in this way",
    ", @xmath15 is the only energy scale that enters and the coupling runs with @xmath15 . _",
    "observable _ simply means that all @xmath16 ( or more precisely @xmath17 itself ) are finite ; no renormalization beyond the one of the coupling and quark masses is needed .",
    "while it is not easy to start from experimentally accessible cross sections and directly relate them to such quantities , sufficient inclusiveness / smearing over energy makes it possible to approximately define physical couplings in terms of experimental data .",
    "however , a direct relation to experimental numbers is not really necessary , rather it is sufficient that the same theory and bare coupling uniquely predict the physical coupling and experimental quantities such as the mass of the proton or decay constants of pion and kaon , @xmath18 . for a lattice computation",
    "this means that there is a great opportunity to choose coupling definitions which can be handled well technically .",
    "we will choose two different ( families of ) couplings , for reasons to be mentioned below .",
    "note also that  rather exceptionally  it is a true advantage that lattice gauge theory works in euclidean space - time .",
    "we turn to the @xmath5-parameters . in massless renormalization schemes , which we assume throughout , and quark mass thresholds will be discussed below . ]",
    "the integration of the callan  symanzik equation _ _ s ( ) = _ s ( ( ) ) yields the exact relation ( at any @xmath15 ) @xmath19 with @xmath20 \\bigg\\ } \\ , .",

    "starting from the above equations it is a simple exercise to derive the _",
    "exact _ relation of @xmath5-parameters @xmath23 . here",
    "one - loop pt yields the non - perturbative result .",
    "this is one reason , why we aim for the @xmath5-parameter .",
    "the second is that once we thus have converted from our scheme to @xmath24 , the coupling can be computed by inserting the perturbative approximation @xmath25 into and for @xmath9 .",
    "there , @xmath26 loops are known @xcite , making the correction term _",
    "s/_s = c_^-1 ( ) +  [ e : perterr ] due to",
    "the difference @xmath27 very small _ in the region where pt applies at all_. , are , for @xmath28 , of order one in the @xmath11 scheme and expected to be so in `` good '' schemes in general . ]",
    "as we will see , the strategy of the alpha collaboration allows to reach @xmath29 non - perturbatively and only there uses pt .",
    "the perturbative error is then around @xmath30 ^ 2 = 10^{-2}$ ] since in the used sf scheme , the function @xmath31 is known to @xmath32 loops .",
    "as said , we have great freedom in our choice for @xmath13 , defining the coupling , but it is a challenge to reach large @xmath15 ( small error term ) in a lattice computation .",
    "the reason is that numerical computations involve both a discretization length , the lattice spacing , @xmath33 , and a total size of the system , @xmath34 that is simulated . for standard observables ,",
    "e.g. the potential of static quarks at short distance , there are finite @xmath34 effects of order @xmath35 requiring @xmath34 to be several fm . at the same time , one needs to suppress discretization errors of order @xmath36 and should extrapolate to @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting inequalities l 1/,1/a l / a / [ e : chall ] lead to the need of very large lattices .",
    "to get a feeling for numbers , we show a semiquantitative plot of the region in @xmath38 which enters vs. @xmath36 , which determines the size of the ( minimal ) discretization errors for the range of lattice spacings @xmath39 reached in the simulations that dominate the present estimates of @xmath6 by the pdg and flag @xcite . the desired @xmath40 point in that plot can only be reached by large extrapolations .",
    "the shaded area shows the region of lattice spacings @xmath41 of present day large volume simulations with @xmath10 evaluated to two loops and @xmath42 .",
    "the data points on the left are simulation points in the finite size scaling computations . ]",
    "however , it has been proposed long ago  @xcite , that one may identify the scales @xmath43 by introducing an observable @xmath17 which depends only on the scale @xmath34 , not on any other ones .",
    "finite size effects are part of the observable rather than one of its errors . instead of",
    "the only restriction is l / a1 , such that @xmath44 lattices are sufficient .",
    "apart from the definition of such observables , it remains to clarify how one connects the perturbative region ( large @xmath15 where one can use , with perturbative @xmath45 ) with the hadronic region ( large @xmath34 , where @xmath35 effects are negligible and one can connect the theory parameters to @xmath18 ) .",
    "this is achieved by      one replaces the derivative of the coupling with respect to the scale , i.e. the @xmath46-function , by the change of the coupling when the scale is varied by a factor of two  @xcite .",
