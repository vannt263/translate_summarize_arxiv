    "the photodisintegration of @xmath2 has been studied extensively .",
    "many of the experimental measurements are in disagreement with each other for photon energies @xmath3 mev , see e.g. , @xcite . in the low - energy regime the photoabsorption cross section ( cs ) is dominated by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions .",
    "the three- and four - body channels become kinematically accessible at incident photon energies of 26.1 mev and 28.3 mev , respectively . however , their contribution is very small . therefore it is not surprising that much of the experimental effort was directed to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 reactions .",
    "the most recent measurements of these css were performed in tunl @xcite .",
    "these measurements are in rough agreement with the exclusive cross sections calculated in @xcite using , however , a simple semi - realistic nuclear potential model . in the latter ,",
    "the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method @xcite was applied .",
    "the advent of using the lit method to calculate the final - state interaction ( fsi ) is the ability to obtain the cs of a specific channel regardless of the other channels , i.e. , even beyond three- and four - body breakup thresholds .",
    "using other methods , one usually has to account for all the open channels simultaneously .    in the low - energy regime ,",
    "the total cross section of the two - body breakup reactions is well - described by the unretarded dipole approximation ( uda ) @xcite .",
    "therefore meson - exchange currents can be included implicitly using siegert s theorem .    unlike the exclusive case , the total , i.e. , inclusive cross section of @xmath2 photoabsorption has already been calculated with state - of - the - art nuclear forces , including three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) , of either a phenomenological type @xcite or from a chiral perturbation effective field theory ( @xmath6eft ) @xcite .",
    "these two calculations , which also utilize the uda , are in excellent agreement with one another , and in reasonable agreement with the majority of experimental data .",
    "therefore , their combined result can serve as a benchmark for calculations of the exclusive reactions that use modern nuclear models .",
    "a step in that direction was made in @xcite , where the exclusive two - body photodisintegration css were calculated using two different nucleon - nucleon interactions that contain central , tensor and spin - orbit components , supplemented with ad - hoc 3nfs .",
    "these calculations yield slightly lower css than @xcite .    in this work we present the first _ ab - initio _ calculation of the exclusive css that uses a state - of - the - art nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "we use the uda and apply the lit method to include the fsi .",
    "the dynamic equations are solved using an extension of the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics ( eihh ) method that allows : @xmath7 construction of the asymptotic wave functions , and @xmath8 isospin - symmetry breaking . in this work",
    "the 3nf is included in the hamiltonian and omitted from the source term of the exclusive lit equation .",
    "using partial - waves expansion in the framework of the unretarded dipole approximation ( uda ) , the cross section @xmath9 for photo - induced breakup of @xmath2 into two fragments , a nucleon @xmath10 and an @xmath11 nucleus , is given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath14 is implied .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , the reduced mass , relative momentum and kinetic energy of the two fragments , and @xmath18 is the photon energy . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the ground - state energies of the target and ejectile nuclei . the continuum wave function @xmath21 is written in the coupling scheme where the relative angular momentum @xmath22 and the nucleon spin @xmath23 are coupled to @xmath24 , which is then coupled with the mass 3 nuclear spin @xmath25 to a total angular momentum @xmath26 . in the uda , the transition @xmath27 is induced by the dipole operator @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the third isospin component , and @xmath30 the position @xmath31 component of the @xmath32th nucleon .",
    "the general problem we face here is how to calculate the transition matrix element of the form @xmath33 here we will restrict ourselves to the case of two outgoing fragments . using the asymptotic function of the outgoing channel @xmath34 , the continuum wave function @xmath35 can be written as a solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an antisymmetrization operator , and @xmath38 is the sum of all interactions between particles belonging to different fragments .",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : lipp_scwing ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_f ] ) we find that @xmath39 is composed of two terms  a born term , which can be easily calculated , and an fsi term , which constitutes the main difficulty .",
    "using the lit method , as described in @xcite , the fsi term can be easily obtained from an auxiliary function @xmath40 , whose lorentz integral transform @xmath41\\left(\\sigma\\right ) = \\int_{e_{th}^-}^{\\infty } \\frac{f_{f}\\left(e\\right){\\mathrm{d}}e } { \\left(e-\\sigma_{r}\\right)^{2}+\\sigma_{i}^{2}},\\quad \\sigma=\\sigma_r+i\\sigma_i,\\quad \\sigma_i>0 , \\label{eq : l_of_f}\\ ] ] can be written as the overlap @xmath42 between the unique solutions of the following schrdinger - like equations @xmath43 in this work , a simplified version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lit_eq_f ] ) is used , where @xmath38 does not include the 3nf that appears in @xmath44 . as explained in @xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lit_eq_i]),([eq : lit_eq_f ] ) can be solved using bound - state methods . for this purpose",
    "we use a new version of the eihh method @xcite developed in @xcite particularly to solve equations of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lit_eq_f ] ) .",
    "in addition , differentiating between the two channels in the coupled scheme requires a summation over the total isospin of the system @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , our code was developed with control over the allowed values of @xmath45 , thus enabling either isospin - symmetry breaking ( isb ) or conservation ( isc ) .",
    "as in @xcite , the lanczos technique @xcite was used to calculate the overlap @xmath42 from which @xmath46 can be obtained @xcite . in this work , the inversion process required to obtain @xmath40 is achieved using a combination of two lits with different values of @xmath47 , as in @xcite .",
    "at first , we tested our isb mechanism , and found that our calculations agree with recent isb calculations for the ground states of the @xmath48 nuclei @xcite .",
    "next we turned to the calculation of exclusive @xmath2 photodisintegration . to check our code , we compared the sum of @xmath49 and @xmath50 to the inclusive cs obtained from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lit_eq_i ] ) as explained , e.g. , in @xcite . as a first check",
    ", we reproduced the work of @xcite , which have used an updated version of the semi - realistic malfliet - tjon nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential  @xcite , termed kmti - iii  @xcite .",
    "this potential contains no 3nf . in our calculation",
    "we have included only the unretarded dipole operator , which does not induce the @xmath51 reaction .",
    "therefore , the sum @xmath52 should coincide with the inclusive cs at least up to the three - body breakup threshold , which lies at @xmath5326.5 mev for the kmti - iii potential .",
    "the comparison between the sum of the exclusive css and the inclusive cs is presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_tbcs ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is an excellent agreement between the sum of the exclusive two - body css and the inclusive cs . in this case , the effect of three- and four - body breakup on the cs becomes visible only above @xmath5334 mev .",
    "photodisintegration cross sections @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( solid curve ) , compared with the inclusive cs ( dashed curve ) ; all calculated with the kmti - iii nn interaction .",
    "( right ) the two - body @xmath54 photodisintegration cross sections @xmath49 ( thin dashed curve ) and @xmath50 ( thin solid curve ) and their sum ( thick solid curve ) , compared with the inclusive cs ( thick dashed curve ) ; all calculated with the av18 nn interaction and uix 3nf .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we now turn to study exclusive @xmath54 photodisintegration with realistic state - of - the - art forces . for the nn interaction we use the av18 potential @xcite ,",
    "supplemented with the uix 3nf @xcite . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_tbcs ] we present our results for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we also compare their sum with the inclusive cs . the large discrepancy between the inclusive cs and the sum of the exclusive css reflects , to our opinion , the fact that the 3nf was not included in the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lit_eq_f ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the role of the 3nf in the fsi is not negligible despite its relative weakness and short range .",
    "also evident in this figure is the relatively large difference between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this result can only be obtained when using isb in the calculation .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this difference is a pure coulomb effect , or is it also affected by charge - symmetry - breaking terms in the potential .",
    "we have performed an _ ab initio _ calculation of exclusive two - body @xmath54 photodisintegration cs with state - of - the - art nuclear forces .",
    "we have used the lit method for exclusive reactions , and the dynamic equations were solved using an updated version of the eihh method . from the convergence of the lit and the variance in the inversion process we estimate an error of the order of 1% in the cs . for the av18/uix potential model we have realized that the sum of the css @xmath52 of the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 does not reproduce the inclusive cs .",
    "this discrepancy is the result of neglecting the 3nf in the source term of the exclusive lit equation  ( [ eq : lit_eq_f ] ) .",
    "we intend to explore this point including also the 3nf in the source term .",
    "the method used here can also be applied for the calculation of nucleon - nucleus scattering reactions .",
