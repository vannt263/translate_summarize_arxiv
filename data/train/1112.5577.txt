    "the main structure of this kind is graphene - the carbon lattice plane from which all other kinds are derived . + the most famous form is fullerene - a material composed of molecules which have the form of a soccer ball @xcite",
    ". other kinds are nanocones , nanotubes , nanotoroids , nanocylinders , nanoribbons etc .",

    "this fact coincides with the choice of the form of the defects in the particular cases .",
    "there is no heptagonal defect in the fullerene , but a lot of these kinds of defects can be found in many open forms of nanostructures .",
    "but we can find them also in some of the closed forms like nanotoroids or more complicated , folded forms of nanotubes .",
    "most often , the heptagons appear in pairs with pentagons in the connecting parts of the folded forms @xcite .",
    "+ because of the applications , the research of the electronic properties of the carbon nanostructures is important . one of the main characteristics is the local density of states ( @xmath3 ) . in the presented model coming from the effective - mass theory , knowledge of the solution of the corresponding dirac equation is necessary for the calculation @xcite .",
    "this solution is represented by the wave - function and to find it , we have to know the geometry of the molecular surface . from the mentioned facts",
    "follows that the chosen geometry can be only an approximation of the complicated real situation : for example , the spherical geometry of fullerene is not suitable for the description of the closest vicinity of the defects but it correctly describes the properties of the whole molecule . as discovered in @xcite for the case of nanocones ,",
    "the most suitable geometry for the description of the close vicinity of the defects is the hyperboloidal geometry",
    ". very often , for a given geometry , the number of possible defects is limited .",
    "+ the solutions for spherical , conical and 2-fold - hyperboloidal cases were found in @xcite . in @xcite , we used the presented model for calculation of the electronic properties of the structures with the geometry of the 1-fold hyperboloid .",
    "the aim was to describe the electronic properties in the vicinity of the locally negative curvature of an arbitrary nanoparticle .",
    "this restriction did not enable us to do the calculations for the case of more than 1 defect . in this paper",
    ", we present a model describing the electronic properties of a simple nanocylinder and a curved nanocylinder including 2 heptagons at the opposite sides of the surface .",
    "the hyperboloidal geometry is used again . because a nanocylinder is an opened nanotube , comparison with the case of the capped nanotube",
    "could be performed ( see e.g. @xcite for this purpose ) . + this paper is organized as follows : the second section describes the computational formalism .",

    "the following calculations of @xmath3 suppose long cylinders with large diameters .",
    "the @xmath27 axis is identical with the axis of the cylinder and the values of @xmath27 coordinate go from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "it means that for @xmath56 , the results must be similar to the solution for the simple graphene and for @xmath57 , the results should correspond to the edge states as stated in @xcite .",
    "but as we will see , our method of calculation is not accurate enough to distinct the edge states for the @xmath48 and the @xmath50 variants , respectively .",
    "the reason is that the dirac equation involves information about the geometrical structure but not about the space coordinates of the individual atoms .",
    "the calculations will be first done for the defect - free cylinder and then for the perturbed cylinder .",
    "+   +      the defect - free cylinder can be described with the help of the parametrization @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the radius .",
    "the metric coefficients will be then @xmath60 and @xmath61 because the metric coefficients are constant , i.e. @xmath62 , it follows for the coefficients of the levi - civita connection and the parameter @xmath63 related to the spin connection @xmath64 from this follows @xmath65 so @xmath66 where @xmath67 the solution has the form @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 the procedure of the calculation of the normalization constants @xmath71 is described in the appendix a. an interesting task is the case of the zero modes which corresponds to the states of electrons at the fermi level .",

    "it is case of the armchair configuration .",
    "as aforementioned , long cylinders with large diameters are supposed , so we choose high values , i. e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 . because of the exponential character of @xmath3 , its values are negligible for a long range of @xmath27 values , so we choose a high @xmath27 in the @xmath75 plot of fig .",

    ", we can conclude from the comparison that @xmath3 is slightly increasing for higher @xmath80 .",
    "although this is only the first order approximation , we will see that the real solution of ( [ pert1st ] ) behaves in a similar manner .",
    "the case of zero modes appropriate to the states at the fermi level is calculated in the appendix c. + comparing the calculated expressions ( [ df0 ] ) , ( [ p0 ] ) for zero modes corresponding to the defect - free and perturbed case , respectively , we see that it has a character of an exponential function related to a polynomial in @xmath27 its order depends on the chosen precision .",
    "this means that the simplest case of the first order polynomial corresponds to the defect - free case , the higher orders of the polynomial correspond to the perturbed case . for higher @xmath27 , the function @xmath102 corresponding to the sublattice",
    "@xmath22 is increasing , whereas the function @xmath103 corresponding to the sublattice @xmath23 is decreasing .",
    "for large diameters , the presented results for the defect - free cylinder should correspond with the density of states for nanoribbons ( _ ac _ or _ zz _ ) .",
    "the reason is that because of a very small curvature , a nanocylinder with a large diameter we can take as an approximation of an infinitely long nanoribbon ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us give a small review about the structure and properties of the nanoribbons .",
    "graphene nanoribbons are materials , theirs molecules have the form of thin , rectangular pieces cut from the graphene layer , so their structure is analogical .",
    "similarly as in the case of graphene nanotubes , _ ac _ and _ zz _ forms are distinguished , theirs difference consists in the form of the edges . denoting @xmath104 the number of hexagonal unit cells by which the nanoribbon width is constituted",
    ", metallic and semiconducting forms can be marked again : a concrete form of nanoribbon is metallic , if @xmath105 is a multiple of @xmath53 , so this condition differs from the condition mentioned in the third chapter for carbon nanotubes .    to calculate the energy spectrum ,",
    "the tight - binding approximation is used . deriving the form of hamiltonian for the given variant ( _ ac _ or _ zz _ )",
    ", we get the set of equations of motion . for _ ac",

    ", we get that the energy spectrum contains the values @xmath112 where @xmath113 . using this procedure for _ zz _",
    ", the analogous energy spectrum appears , but the formulas are a little bit modificated . in @xcite ,",
    "similar results are obtained for the carbon nanotubes . + now the @xmath3 for _ ac _ nanoribbons will be calculated and the results will be compared with the above stated calculations for the defect - free nanocylinder .",
    "the corresponding formulae is @xmath114 where @xmath115 @xmath116 is the dirac delta function and @xmath117 is the wavenumber .",
    "let us stress that the integration over @xmath117 is used here instead of the integration over @xmath27 .",
    "both kinds of integration are related by the fourier transform , as follows from @xcite . for different @xmath117 , we see the plots of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fg7 ] . evidently , excluding the case @xmath118",
    ", the results more or less correspond to the solution given by the formulas ( [ er1 ] ) , ( [ er2 ] ) .",
    "+     as a function of @xmath77 for @xmath118 ( left ) , @xmath119 ( middle ) and @xmath120 ( right ) for _ ac _ nanoribbons , title=\"fig : \" ]    in @xcite , the possible solutions for @xmath50 are divided into the cases of the extended and the localized states .",
    "the form of the corresponding wavefunction for the localized states is @xmath121 since for large @xmath27 we can write @xmath122 this form corresponds to the solution for the defect - free case ( [ er1 ] ) , ( [ er2 ] ) .",
    "so , we see an important coincidence with the results found for nanoribbons in @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper are related to the case of @xmath48 configuration , but as stressed in the beginning of the fourth section , our method of calculation does not distinguish between @xmath48 and @xmath50 and the plots for case of @xmath50 would be similar .",
    "+ because of the discrete spectrum of carbon nanoribbons and from the fact that it can be sometimes understood as an approximation of the nanocylinders a question arises about a possibility of calculation the low energy electronic states for the case of small defects .",
    "similar task was done in @xcite for the case of the spheroidal geometry .",
    "this could be possible in case of using different methods for calculation of the @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", the resulting energy spectrum can be understood as continuous , so there is not any possibility of shifting the energy levels due to the defects .",
    "comparing the plots of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fg7 ] with the plots in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] , we see that both figures are similar but not completely same .",
    "the reason is in difference between the used procedures : for the purpose of fig .",
    "[ fg7 ] , the energy spectrum is first calculated in ( [ spectac ] ) and then the corresponding @xmath3 is found according to ( [ ldos ] ) , but the procedure used in chapter iv is opposite , i.e. first the @xmath3 is calculated and then the energy spectrum is estimated from the plots ( as in @xcite ) . because such a procedure is only a rough approximation , it does not enable us to find the localized states for zero energy as in ( [ ldos ] ) .",
    "so , only the method described in the previous chapter enables us to distinguish metals and semimetals .",
    "furthermore , according to @xcite , the condition for nanoribbons to be metal is different from the condition for nanotubes , so the results could never be exactly same .",
    "+ the presented results for perturbed cylinder are only the first order approximation of the real solutions which are presented in figs .",
    "[ fg8 ] and [ fg9 ] .",
    "because of the complicated form of ( [ pert1st ] ) , the solutions were acquired in a numerical way . the analytical solutions we can get in a more precise form , if we increase the order of the parameter @xmath80 in ( [ er4 ] ) .",
    "it follows from the plots on logarithmic scale in figs .",
    "[ fg8 ] , [ fg9 ] ( and also from fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] for the first order solution ) that for @xmath123 , a localized state with a small amplitude appears . from this",
    "we see the evidence that the metallic properties of the nanocylinder are increasing by adding a perturbation into the structure .",
    "+ to conclude , the @xmath3 was researched for nanocylinders without and with a defect .",
    "we found that for the defect - free case , the electronic properties can sometimes correspond to the case of infinitely long nanoribbons .",
    "for the case of perturbation , the metallic properties are more manifested .",
    "+ the generation of the nanocylinders is in a close correspondence with the generation of the nanotubes .",
    "the most exploited method is the chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) which is based on the production of the required material from the surface of a substrate by volatile precursors .",
    "usually it is realized as a thermal reaction called catalytic growth process , when the growth of carbon nanotubes is catalyzed in a heated flow furnace by a carbon surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "this process is activated by iron and nickel nanoparticles with the help of acetylene and hydrogen as the precursors .",
    "the nanocylinders are produced in this process together with the nanotubes or they arise from the nanotubes with the help of other thermal or chemical processes .",
    "the surface of the nanotubes is usually unreactive , but the change of its structure can be provoked by catalytically active atoms of rhenium inserted into the nanotubes @xcite . for the case of the perturbed nanocylinder , as presented in this paper , its structure can be determined by the presence of two heptagonal defects on the surface , but this structure sometimes appears without defects and it is only given by different lengths of the bonds between the atoms .",
    "the calculations performed in this paper are valid anyway .     as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for perturbed cylinder with @xmath98 on linear ( left ) and logarithmic ( right ) scale ( numerical solution),title=\"fig : \" ]     as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for perturbed cylinder with @xmath99 on linear ( left ) and logarithmic ( right ) scale ( numerical solution),title=\"fig : \" ]",
