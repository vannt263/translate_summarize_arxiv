    "quantum physics is a fascinating but subtle subject .",
    "the subtlety of the quantum system described here arises from the fact , that gravity appears very weak in our universe .",
    "quantum theory and gravitation affect each other , and , when neutrons become ultra - cold , the fall experiment of galileo galilei shows quantum aspects of the subtle gravity force in that sense that neutrons do not fall continuously .",
    "we find them on different levels , when they come close to a reflecting mirror for neutrons  @xcite .",
    "of course , such bound states with discrete energy levels are expected when the graviational potential is larger than the energy of the particle . here",

    "retroreflectors for atoms have used the electric dipole force in an evanescent light wave  @xcite or they are based on the gradient of the magnetic dipole interaction , which has the advantage of not requiring a laser  @xcite .",
    "a neutron mirror makes use of the strong interaction between nuclei and an ultracold neutron , resulting in an effective repulsive force : neutrons propagate in condensed matter in a matter similar to the propagation of light but with a neutron refractive index less than unity .",
    "thus , one considers the surface of matter as constituting a potential step of height @xmath3 .",

    "ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) are neutrons that , in contrast to faster neutrons , are retro - reflected from surfaces at all angles of incidence . when the surface roughness of the mirror is small enough , the ucn reflection is specular .",
    "neutron mirrors are interesting because they can be used to store neutrons , to focus neutrons , or even to build a fabry perot interferometer for neutron de broglie waves .",
    "ucn storage bottle experiments have improved our knowledge about the neutron lifetime significantly or , together with the ramsey method of separated oscillating fields , they have been used for a search for an electric dipole moment of the neutron .",

    "this magnetic moment can induce a magnetic mirror force onto a neutron that hovers close to the surface of a body .",
