    "for @xmath306 the usual sachs - wolfe contribution ( fig.[fig : spectrum_p3]b ) is the most important contribution , and thus the asymmetry of the total @xmath295 is of the kind that even multipoles @xmath290 dominate the odd ones . in the range",
    "@xmath307 the doppler contribution dominates leading to a reversal of the even - odd asymmetry in the total @xmath295 , see fig.[fig : spectrum_p3]a . for @xmath308",
    "the usual sachs - wolfe contribution dominates again leading to a further reversal of the even - odd asymmetry . in this way the complex behaviour of the angular power spectrum @xmath295 can be understood .",
    "although this discussion is restricted to the special case @xmath302 , the numeric shows that cosmological models having values of @xmath300 not too far from @xmath309 display such a behaviour .",
    "so this asymmetric behaviour survives for a large class of models .",
    "a comparison of the projective space @xmath264 with the simply - connected @xmath4 can be found in fig.[fig : spectrum_p3]f .",

    "the projective space @xmath264 possesses this asymmetry as discussed due to its odd wave numbers .",
    "although there exists no spherical space form which has only even wave numbers , it is interesting to compute the angular power spectrum @xmath295 for an artificial spectrum having only even wave numbers . the result is shown in fig.[fig : spectrum_p3]f , and one observes its complementary behaviour with respect to the projective space @xmath264 . this neatly explains why no even - odd asymmetry occurs in the case of the @xmath4 space .",
    "the even - odd asymmetry determines the behaviour of the correlation function @xmath244 at angles around @xmath310 . in fig.[fig : spectrum_p3]e the different contributions are shown separately .",
    "the asymmetry of the usual sachs - wolfe contribution leads to large positive values at @xmath310 , whereas the doppler contribution gives large negative values .",
    "this behaviour follows from eq.([eq : c_theta_cl ] ) and @xmath311 . due to the dominance of the usual sachs - wolfe contribution at large scales , the total correlation function @xmath244 possesses large values for @xmath312 .",
    "since a low power is observed in the cmb sky at these scales , models with @xmath313 are unrealistic .",
    "in this paper we study spherical models of our universe which possess spatial spaces that are multi - connected .",
    "these spaces with positive spatial curvature arise by tiling the 3-sphere @xmath4 using a deck group @xmath7 . we restrict attention to groups of order 8 such that the volume of the considered manifolds is @xmath314 .",
    "there are two such lens spaces @xmath20 and @xmath15 , and the @xmath22 manifold which is obtained by the binary dihedral group @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , there are two cubic platonic manifolds @xmath14 and @xmath21 , however , it is shown that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equivalent and @xmath21 corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "such a multi - connected space can be represented by its fundamental domain which is the subset of points such that no element of @xmath26 can operate inside the domain , but any point of the cover outside the domain can be reached by the action of @xmath7 on a point inside the domain . such a cell is called a voronoi domain .",
    "it is the natural domain for an observer sitting at the origin of the coordinate system for which the group elements @xmath17 are defined .",
    "if the group elements @xmath17 are independent of the choice of the position of the observer , all observers construct the same voronoi domain .",
    "such manifolds are called homogeneous . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is such a dependence , the shape of the voronoi domain varies and such manifolds are called inhomogeneous . from the above manifolds ,",
    "only @xmath106 is inhomogeneous .",
    "one can construct a spatial curve along which the observer can be shifted such that at one position the lens shaped voronoi domain emerges whereas at an other position , the cubic platonic voronoi domain @xmath14 appears .",
    "other positions do not lead to domains having special properties .",
    "the important point for cosmic topology is that the statistical properties of the cmb anisotropies depend on the group elements @xmath17 defined for an observer that sits at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "thus , inhomogeneous manifolds allow a much richer variety of cmb anisotropies , and the comparison with observations is much more involved . for the multi - connected spherical spaces generated by groups @xmath7 of order 8 , the temperature 2-point correlation function @xmath244 , eq.([eq : c_theta ] ) , and the multipole moments @xmath248 , eq.([eq : cl_ensemble_general ] ) ,",
    "are computed for the cmb anisotropies . a suitable measure for the suppression of the anisotropies at large angular scales",
    "is the @xmath273 statistics ( [ eq : s_60 ] ) which emphasises the unusual behaviour at scales @xmath315 .",
    "the focus is put on the inhomogeneous space @xmath106 , for which a one dimensional sequence of observer positions is derived which exhaust all possibilities allowed by this inhomogeneous space .",
    "the cmb anisotropies are calculated for this sequence , and it turns out that the strongest large scale suppression occurs for the platonic cubic voronoi domain , which has the observer in the centre of the @xmath14 cell .",
    "on the other hand , the least suppression is observed for the lens shaped domain .",
    "this is in agreement with the hypothesis that well proportioned domains give the largest suppression of power .",
    "thus , the example of the inhomogeneous lens space @xmath268 demonstrates that it can be premature to classify all lens spaces as not - well proportioned domains and thus uninteresting with respect to the observed cmb power suppression .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath282 , the homogeneous platonic space @xmath21 leads to an even stronger suppression of large scale cmb anisotropy than it is the case for all observer positions in @xmath14 .",
    "the special case that appears when the distance @xmath300 to the surface of last scattering satisfies @xmath302 is studied , although the cosmological parameters are unrealistic in this case",
    ". then the topology requires an antipodal symmetry which partly survives in the cmb anisotropies and is reflected in the @xmath273 statistics .",
