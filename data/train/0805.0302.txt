    "deciphering the microscopic mechanism responsible for high - temperature ( high-@xmath5 ) superconductivity has remained an elusive challenge for 20 years .",

    "for example , the pseudogap state  the normal state of underdoped high-@xmath5 superconductors  is characterized by two properties that are difficult to reconcile .",
    "first , angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies of the electronic structure in the pseudogap state have revealed the existence of hole - like arcs centered around the diagonal of the brillouin zone supporting gapless quasiparticles  @xcite .",
    "fermi arcs can not be attributed to a fermi liquid ( fl ) : the fermi surface of a fl can only terminate at the boundary of the brillouin zone .",

    "quantum oscillations come about when quasiparticles are orbiting around a closed fermi surface .",
    "these and other hallmarks of the pseudogap state has lead to two conflicting interpretations ; either the pseudogap state is a precursor to superconductivity or it is related to an order that competes with superconductivity  @xcite .",

    "we have shown that the back folding is strongly enhanced near the so - called 1/8-anomaly and it appears independent of the ( local and global ) crystal structure .",

    "it is difficult to extract such information from the spectrum close to the zone boundary because ( i ) the intensity is strongly suppressed at @xmath18 due to the pseudogap and ( ii ) @xmath32 is comparable to the diameter of the predicted electron pocket .",
    "however , transport measurements on this material  @xcite and other so - called stripe compounds  @xcite have revealed the existence of a negative hall coefficient at low temperatures ; the usual fingerprint of an electron pocket .",

    "the qualitative observation of a hole pocket is compatible with many theories .",
    "band structure calculations have shown that pockets can form in orthorhombic crystal structures @xcite . however , the fact that the secondary band is enhanced for @xmath88 in orthorhombic la@xmath9sr@xmath24cuo@xmath3 would suggests that orthorhombic lattice distortions can not be the primary cause for the fermi surface reconstruction that we observe .",
    "models that invoke spin and charge separation of the electron quantum numbers  @xcite or competing orders@xcite also predict a hole pocket in the pseudogap phase .",
    "moreover , an electron pocket is predicted to coexist with a hole pocket as a result of competing orders  @xcite .",
    "a clue favoring the scenario by which competing order is causing the fermi - surface reconstruction seen by arpes in ndlsco and la@xmath28sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is the observation of a spin - density wave lro in these materials @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the fermi surface reconstruction is present above the onset temperature of the spin - density wave lro suggests that this true lro is not required for the formation of pockets  @xcite .",
    "in summary , our unambiguous observation of a secondary branch of gapless quasiparticles around the zone diagonal in the stripe - compound ndlsco is consistent with a hole - like fermi surface induced by a unit cell doubling with the characteristic momentum @xmath55 .",
    "such a secondary branch was also observed in underdoped lsco ( @xmath89 ) by x.j .",
