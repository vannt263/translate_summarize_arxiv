    "the generation of neutrino masses is an important issue in any realistic extension of the standard model . in general , the values of these masses ( of the order of , or less than , 1 ev ) that are needed to explain all neutrino oscillation data  @xcite are not enough to put strong constraints on model building .",
    "it means that several models can induce neutrino masses and mixing compatible with experimental data .",
    "so , instead of proposing models built just to explain the neutrino properties , it is more useful to consider what are the neutrino masses that are predicted in any particular model which has motivation other than the explanation of neutrino physics .",
    "for instance , the 3 - 3 - 1 model was proposed as a possible symmetry on the lightest lepton sector @xmath1  @xcite . once assumed that symmetry it has to be implemented in the rest of the leptons and also in the quark sector .",
    "like in the standard model if we do not introduce right - handed neutrinos and/or violation of the total lepton number neutrinos remain massless at any order in perturbation theory . in this vain",

    "we consider the generation of neutrino masses in a supersymmetric 3 - 3 - 1 model with broken @xmath0 parity .",
    "we show that , as an effect of the mixing among all leptons of the same charge , at the tree level only one charged lepton and one neutrino remain massless but they gain mass through radiative corrections . in order to compare this model",
    "we do the same calculations in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath0 broken parity also . in both cases",
    "we are not assuming that sneutrinos gain non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) i.e. , the only non - zero vevs are those of the scalars of the non - supersymmetric models .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in sec .",
