    "the surface magnetic field strength is estimated to be @xmath15 @xmath16 g , where @xmath17 represents the gravitational redshift .",
    "@xcite examined the relation between the magnetic field strength estimated from the crsf and the pulsation period in x - ray binary pulsars , and discussed a group of `` slow rotators '' ; represented by such sources as vela x-1 and gx 301@xmath02 , these objects have much longer pulsation periods than would be expected if they were in rotational equilibria .",
    "the obtained field strength of @xmath18 g , and the pulsation period of 275.46 s measured during the suzaku observation , place gx 304@xmath01 just in the range of the typical slow rotators .",
    "we performed spectral analysis of the rxte data covering the outburst in 2010 august on an almost daily basis .",
    "the crsf has also been confirmed in 10 rxte observations in which the source was bright enough .",
    "therefore , the crsf is a persistent effect of this object .",
    "however , the crsf energy was observed to vary , either in a positive correlation with the luminosity , or in a bimodal manner with @xmath1950 kev and @xmath1954 kev .",
    "variations of the crsf energy during a single outburst have been observed from 4u  0115@xmath263 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and x  0331@xmath253 ( v  0332@xmath253 ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the behavior of gx 304@xmath01 revealed in the present study , these two objects show negative correlations , that the crsf energy decreases as the luminosity increases .",
    "the negative correlation can be explained by presuming that the cyclotron - scattering photosphere gets higher when the accretion rate increased in the super - eddington accretion regime @xcite .    a positive correlation between the crsf energy and the luminosity has been seen in the long - term behavior of her x-1 over multiple outbursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in additions",
    ", different crsf energies were measured between two orbital phases in gx 301@xmath02 @xcite .",
    "the behavior is expected in a sub - eddington accretion , where the cyclotron - scattering photosphere is lowered by the dynamical pressure of the accretion @xcite .",
    "the observed behavior of gx 304@xmath01 , if interpreted as showing a positive dependence of @xmath20 on the luminosity , may be a manifestation of the same effects , and regarded as the first example that the relation was observed in a single outburst .",
    "indeed , the fraction of the crsf - energy change , @xmath21 6% , is similar to that observed in her x-1 , and reasonably agrees with that of the quantitative estimate in these situations in @xcite .",
    "a bimodal change in the crsf energy was observed from a 0535@xmath226 by @xcite ; they measured the resonance energy at @xmath1446 kev in the 2005 outburst , and at @xmath1454 kev during its pre - putburst , even though the luminosity was comparable on the two occasions .",
    "@xcite interpreted this effect in terms of magnetospheric instabilities between the accretion disk and the neutron - star magnetosphere at the onset of accretion .",
    "the same scenario may apply also to our figure 4 , if it is interpreted as representing two typical values of @xmath20 .",
    "since the mission started on 2010 august 15 , maxi detected four x - ray outbursts from gx 304@xmath01 by 132.5-day intervals .",
    "as reported by @xcite , this confirmed the recurrence of the source activities after 28 years of x - ray disappearance .",
    "the source may have returned to the active state such that it had been in until 1980 .",
    "we urge continuous monitoring of this source , and follow - up observations of outbursts with hard x - ray instruments for further studies of the crsf behaviors .",
