    "according to a well - know theorem by sturm , the zeros of the @xmath0-th eigenfunction of a vibrating string divide the string into @xmath0 `` nodal intervals '' .",
    "the courant nodal line theorem carries over one half of sturm s theorem to the theory of membranes : courant proved that the @xmath0-th eigenfunction can not have more than @xmath0 domains .",
    "he also provided an example showing that no non - trivial lower bound for the number nodal domains can be hoped for in @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "but what can be said about the number of nodal domain on graphs ? earliest research on graphs concentrated on laplace and schrdinger operators on discrete ( combinatorial ) graphs .",
    "the functions on discrete graphs take values on vertices of the graph and the schrdinger operator is defined by @xmath6 where the sum is taken over all vertices adjacent to the vertex @xmath7 .",
    "gantmacher and krein @xcite proved than on a chain graph ( a tree with no branching which can be thought of as a discretization of the interval ) an analogue of sturm s result holds : the @xmath0-th eigenvector changes sign exactly @xmath8 times .",
    "but for non - trivial graphs the situation departs dramatically from its @xmath4 analogue .",
    "first of all , courant s upper bound does not always hold .",
    "there is a correction due to multiplicity of the @xmath0-th eigenvalue and the upper bound becomes @xcite @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the multiplicity . in this paper",
    "we discuss another striking difference .",
    "if the number of cycles of a graph is not large , the graph behaves `` almost '' like a string : for a typical eigenvector , there is a lower bound on the number of nodal domains .    to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath2 be the minimal number of edges of the graph that distinguish it from a tree ( a graph with no loops ) . in terms of the number of vertices @xmath11 and the number of edges @xmath12",
    ", the number @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath13 .",
    "we show that , for a typical eigenvector , the number of nodal domains is greater or equal to @xmath1 . in particular , on trees ( @xmath3 ) the nodal counting is exact : the @xmath0-th eigenfunction has exactly @xmath0 domains . here by a `` typical '' eigenvector we mean an eigenvector which corresponds to a simple eigenvalue and which is not zero on any of the vertices .",
    "this property is stable with respect to small perturbations of the potential @xmath14",
    ".    another graph model on which the question of nodal domains is well - defined is the so - called quantum or metric graphs .",
    "these are graphs with edges parameterized by the distance to a pre - selected start vertex .",
    "the functions now live on the edges of the graph and are required to satisfy matching conditions on the vertices of the graph .",
    "the laplacian in this case is the standard 1-dimensional laplacian",
    ". a good review of the history of quantum graphs and some of their applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "the ideas that the zeros of the eigenfunctions on the metric _ trees _ behave similarly to the 1-dimensional case have been around for some time .",
    "al - obeid , pokornyi and pryadiev @xcite showed that for a metric tree in a `` general position '' ( which is roughly equivalent to our genericity assumption  [ assum : simple_upto ] , see section  [ sec : proofs ] ) the number of the nodal domains of @xmath0-th eigenfunction is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "this result was rediscovered by schapotschnikow @xcite who was motivated by the recent interest towards nodal domains in the physics community @xcite .    our result on the lower bound extends to the quantum graphs as well .",
    "similarly to the discrete case , we prove that even for graphs with @xmath15 , @xmath1 is a lower bound on the number of nodal domains of the @xmath0-th eigenfunction .    the article is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : main_result ] we explain the models we are considering , formulate our result and review the previous results on the nodal counting on graphs .",

    ", we believe our results to be previously unknown and in section  [ sec : proofs ] we provide complete proofs . for completeness , we also include a sketch of the general idea behind the proofs of @xcite in the appendix .",
    "finally , in the last subsection of section  [ sec : proofs ] we show that when a graph does not satisfy our genericity conditions , the nodal count can fall arbitrarily far below the number of the corresponding eigenfunction .",

    "note that if the edge @xmath64 is the reverse of the edge @xmath30 then @xmath65 and @xmath66 refer to the same point .",
    "now one can define a function on an edge and , therefore , define a function @xmath43 on the whole graph as a collection of functions @xmath67 on all edges of the graph . to ensure that the function is well defined we impose the condition @xmath68 for all @xmath69 .",

    "for dirichlet boundary conditions one can show @xcite that @xmath260 is an eigenvalue of the graph if @xmath261 to obtain all eigenvalues of the star graph , one needs to add to the solutions of ( [ eq : star_tan ] ) the points which are `` multiple '' poles of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : star_tan ] ) .",

    "those eigenvalues that are not poles ( but zeros ) of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : star_tan ] ) interlace the poles : between each pair of consecutive poles ( coming from different cotangents ) there is exactly one zero .",
    "now we choose the lengths @xmath263 to exploit the above features .",
    "let @xmath264 , @xmath265 for some @xmath266 , and the remaining lengths be irrational pairwise incommensurate numbers slightly greater than 1 . by construction , @xmath267 is a pole for @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunction is a sine - wave on the edges @xmath270 and @xmath271 and is zero on the other edges .",
    "it is easy to see that it has @xmath272 nodal domains . on the other hand ,",
    "counting the poles of ( [ eq : star_tan ] ) , one can deduce that there are @xmath273 eigenvalues preceding @xmath274 .",
    "thus , we have constructed an eigenfunction which is very high in the spectrum but has low number of nodal domains .",
    "a similar construction is possible for discrete graphs as well .",
    "the result of the present article came about because of two factors .",
    "the first was the request by uzy smilansky that the author give a talk on the results of @xcite at the workshop `` nodal week 2006 '' at weizmann institute of science .",
    "the second was the discussion the author had with rami band on his proof that the nodal count resolves isospectrality of two graphs , one with @xmath3 and the other with @xmath275 ( now a part of @xcite ) .",
    "rami showed that the nodal count of the latter graph is @xmath276 or @xmath0 with equal frequency .",
    "his result lead the author to conjecture that for the graphs close to trees the nodal count of the @xmath0-th eigenstate does not stray far from @xmath0 .",
    "the author is also grateful to uzy smilansky and rami band for patiently listening to the reports on the progress made in the proof of the conjecture and carefully checking the draft of the manuscript .",

    "most of the work was done during the author s visit to the department of physics of complex systems , weizmann institute of science , israel .",
    "in this section we give an informal overview of the proof of ( [ eq : discr_bound ] ) on a metric tree ( @xmath3 ) . for detailed and rigorous proofs",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath277 be an eigenpair for a tree @xmath111 satisfying assumption  [ assum : simple_upto ] .",
    "choose an arbitrary boundary vertex of the tree @xmath111 and call it the _ root _",

    "if @xmath29 is vertex 6 then it has two incoming subtrees , one consisting of edges @xmath278 , @xmath38 and @xmath279 ( highlighted in thicker lines ) and the other consisting of only one edge @xmath280 .",
    "the outgoing edge of @xmath29 is the edge @xmath281 . ]",
    "if we drop the boundary condition at the root , then for any @xmath282 there is a solution @xmath283 which solves the equation @xmath284 and satisfies all remaining vertex conditions .",

    "the function @xmath70 can be constructed recursively .",
    "we fix @xmath158 and initialize the recursion by solving the equation @xmath284 on the outgoing edge of each non - root boundary vertex and imposing the boundary condition corresponding to this vertex .",
    "now let @xmath29 be a vertex such that the equation is solved on each incoming subtree @xmath285 .",
    "we denote these solutions ( which are defined up to a multiplicative constant ) by @xmath286 .",
    "we would like to match these solutions and to extend them to the outgoing edge of @xmath29 .",
    "suppose that all of the functions @xmath289 assume non - zero values on the vertex @xmath29 .",
    "then the condition on @xmath287 takes the form @xmath290 it is now clear that @xmath291 , as a solution of @xmath284 satisfying this condition , is also defined up to a multiplicative constant , @xmath292 .",
    "the continuity condition now fixes the constants @xmath293 to be @xmath294 .",
    "thus we obtain the solution on the union of subtrees @xmath285 and the outgoing edge of @xmath29 .",
    "this union is in turn an incoming subtree for another vertex ( or the root ) .    in the case",
    "when one of @xmath289 is zero on the vertex @xmath29 ( without loss of generality we take @xmath295 ) , the condition on @xmath291 takes the form @xmath296 .",
    "the solution @xmath291 is again defined up to a multiplicative constant @xmath292 .",
    "the values of the other constants are now given by @xmath297 and @xmath298 when @xmath299 .",
    "again the solution on the union of subtrees @xmath285 and the outgoing edge of @xmath29 is obtained up to a constant .",
    "finally , if more than one of @xmath289 is zero on the vertex @xmath29 ( without loss of generality , @xmath300 ) , one can take @xmath298 for all @xmath301 , find non - zero @xmath302 and @xmath303 such that @xmath304 and extend the function by zero on the rest of the tree .",
    "this function will satisfy the kirchhoff condition at @xmath29 and also all other vertex conditions .",
    "thus it is an eigenfunction and , moreover , it is equal to zero at an inner vertex .",
    "this contradicts our assumptions .",
    "we have now constructed a function @xmath305 which coincides with the eigenfunction of the tree whenever it satisfies the boundary condition at the root . to count the nodal domains we need to understand the behavior of zeros of @xmath70 as we change @xmath158 . in order to do",
    "that we consider the function @xmath306 where the derivative is taken with respect to @xmath307 in the direction towards the root . if @xmath307 is a zero of @xmath70 , it becomes a pole of @xmath308 .",
    "from the definition of @xmath308 we see that @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",

    "this can be seen by assuming the contrary and considering the point @xmath325 $ ] where @xmath326 .    using these properties",
    "one can conclude that for each fixed @xmath327 , the value @xmath328 is decreasing as a function of @xmath158 between the pairs of consecutive poles .",
    "a direct consequence of this is that the poles of @xmath315 move in the `` negative '' direction as the parameter @xmath158 is increased .",
    "the zeros of @xmath70 , therefore , move in the direction from the root to the leaves . since @xmath87 is continuous , zeros of @xmath70 can not bifurcate on the edges , see remark  [ rem : genericity_of_ass ] in section  [ sec : assum ] .    to see that the zeros of @xmath70 do not split when passing through the vertices ,",
    "assume the contrary and consider the reverse picture : @xmath158 is decreasing .",
    "there are at least two subtrees with zeros of @xmath70 approaching the same vertex @xmath29 as @xmath158 approaches some critical value from above . at this critical value",
    "we thus have two subtrees on which @xmath70 has zero at @xmath29 .",
    "but earlier we concluded that this situation contradicts our genericity assumption .    to summarize , as @xmath158",
    "is increased , new zeros appear at the root and move towards the leaves of the tree .",
    "the zeros already in the tree do not disappear or increase in number .",
    "now suppose @xmath134 is an eigenvalue and thus @xmath329 .",
    "as we increase @xmath158 the value of @xmath330 _ decreases _ to @xmath187 , jumps to @xmath186 ( when a new zero enters the tree ) and then increases to @xmath331 again .",
