    "in spite of much effort to incorporate microscopic features of the alpha - alpha ( @xmath3 ) interaction , a consistent description of the three - alpha ( @xmath0 ) and two - alpha plus @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) systems has not yet been obtained so far in the faddeev formalism .",
    "the most favorable description of the @xmath3 system is the @xmath3 resonating - group method ( rgm ) @xcite .",
    "although some of the previous works deal with the @xmath3 rgm kernel explicitly in the @xmath0-cluster faddeev formalism , they usually yield a large overbinding for the ground state and sometimes involve spurious states because of an incomplete treatment of the pauli - forbidden states in the @xmath0 model space @xcite .",
    "various types of @xmath0 orthogonality condition models ( ocm ) @xcite also yield a similar overbinding for the ground state , although the effect of the pauli principle between @xmath6 clusters is satisfactorily treated in each framework .",
    "only one exception for this rule is the @xmath0 ocm in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the pauli forbidden components described by the @xmath3 bound - state solutions of the deep buck , friedrich , and wheatley ( bfw ) potential @xcite is completely eliminated .",
    "the result is rather similar to the traditional @xmath0 faddeev calculation using ali - bodmer phenomenological @xmath3 potential with a repulsive core @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the ground - state energy of the @xmath0 system is less than 1.5 mev , and a simultaneous description of the compact shell - model like ground state and the excited @xmath9 state with well - developed cluster structure is not possible .",
    "the origin of the different conclusions in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , is spelled out in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the existence of almost forbidden faddeev components inherent to this @xmath0 ocm using the bound - state pauli - forbidden states of the bfw potential is essential .",
    "a possible resolution of this overbinding problem of the @xmath0 model is found in our new three - cluster faddeev formalism , which uses singularity - free @xmath10-matrices ( rgm @xmath10-matrices ) generated from the two - cluster rgm kernels @xcite . in this formalism , solving the faddeev equation automatically guarantees the elimination of the three - cluster redundant components from the total wave function .",
    "the explicit energy dependence inherent in the exchange rgm kernel is self - consistently treated .",
    "we first applied this formalism to the three - dineutron and @xmath0 systems , and obtained complete agreement between the faddeev calculations and variational calculations using the translationally invariant harmonic - oscillator ( h.o . )",
    "basis @xcite .",
    "next , this formalism was applied to a faddeev calculation of the three - nucleon bound state @xcite , which employs complete off - shell @xmath10-matrices derived from the non - local and energy - dependent rgm kernels of the quark - model @xmath11 interactions , fss @xcite and fss2 @xcite .",
    "the fss2 model yields a triton binding energy @xmath12 mev in the 50 channel calculation , when the @xmath13 interaction is employed for all the @xmath11 pairs in the isospin basis @xcite .",
    "the effect of the charge dependence of the two - body @xmath11 interaction is estimated to be @xmath14 mev for the triton binding energy @xcite .",
    "this implies that our result is not overbinding in comparison with the empirical value , @xmath15 mev .",
    "if we attribute the difference , 0.15 mev , to the effect of the three - nucleon force , it is by far smaller than the generally accepted values , @xmath16 mev @xcite , predicted by many faddeev calculations employing modern realistic meson - theoretical @xmath11 interactions .",
    "we have further applied this three - cluster faddeev formalism to the hypertriton system @xcite , in which the quark - model hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath17 ) interactions of fss2 yield a reasonable result of the hypertriton properties similar to the nijmegen soft - core potential nsc89 @xcite .",
    "most mathematical details for the faddeev equation , employed in this calculation , are given in the present paper .",
    "here we apply the present three - cluster faddeev formalism to the @xmath2 model for @xmath7 .",
    "this hypernucleus plays an important role to study the @xmath4 interaction in the @xmath18-shell @xmath1-hypernuclei . from the early time of the hypernuclear study , @xmath19 is considered to be a prototype of @xmath6-cluster structure , in which the two @xmath6 clusters form a loosely bound subsystem by the effect of the extra @xmath1 hyperon @xcite . since the @xmath17 interaction is usually weaker than the @xmath11 interaction , this system is suitable for studying a subtle structure change of the two-@xmath6 system from @xmath20 . in fact , in addition to the @xmath21 ground state @xcite with the @xmath1-separation energy @xmath22 @xcite , the recent @xmath23-ray spectroscopy @xcite has revealed the existence of two narrow resonances in the excited states , which are supposed to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 states generated from the small spin - orbit splitting in the weak coupling picture of @xmath26 . from a theoretical point of view , this is the simplest non - trivial system which requires the faddeev formalism with two identical particles , involving three pauli - forbidden states between two clusters .",

    "hiyama et al .",
    "@xcite used the ocm for the @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath27 systems and discussed not only the ground state of @xmath7 , but also the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states @xcite .",

    "our purpose for the @xmath2 faddeev calculations using @xmath3 rgm kernels is threefold .",
    "first , we develop a general three - cluster faddeev formalism with two identical clusters , in order to apply it to more complex three - cluster systems like the hypertriton interacting via quark - model baryon - baryon interactions . in the hypertriton system",
    ", we have to deal with the @xmath37-@xmath38 coupled - channel system which involves a pauli - forbidden state at the quark level in the @xmath4-@xmath39 subsystem .",
    "since the baryon - baryon interactions in the quark model are formulated in the two - cluster rgm formalism , the present three - cluster formalism is most appropriate to correlate the baryon - baryon interactions with the structure of few - baryon systems .",
    "the second purpose is to make a consistent description of the @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 systems using effective @xmath11 and @xmath4 interactions .",
    "this attempt is beyond the scope of the usual ocm framework and the faddeev formalism assuming only inter - cluster potentials .",
    "a comparison of the present @xmath0 results with the fully microscopic @xmath0 rgm or gcm @xcite is useful to examine the approximations involved in the present three - cluster formalism .",
    "the third purpose is to present a tractable effective @xmath4 force for cluster calculations of various @xmath18-shell hypernuclei , which is not purely phenomenological but derived microscopically from quark - model baryon - baryon interactions . in particular",
    ", this effective @xmath4 force should be able to reproduce the correct @xmath1-separation energy of @xmath40 ; @xmath41 .",
    "such a @xmath5 interaction is indispensable for , e.g. , a @xmath42 faddeev calculation using the quark - model @xmath43 interaction @xcite . in this paper",

    "the coulomb effect between the two @xmath6-clusters is included by a cut - off coulomb force at the nucleon level . the cut - off radius , @xmath205 - 14 fm seems to be sufficient for a 1 - 2 kev accuracy .",
    "in the present formalism , the structure change of two @xmath6-clusters inside @xmath200 is clearly identified by calculating the kinetic - energy contribution in the two-@xmath6 expectation value @xmath152 .",
    "the comparison of the coulomb contributions in the @xmath3 bound state , @xmath152 and the @xmath200 ground state with respect to the change of @xmath206 is very useful to measure the compactness of the two-@xmath6 configurations in various environments .",
    "it is confirmed that the @xmath9 ground state and the @xmath207 exited state of @xmath200 are well described by the contracted two-@xmath6 cluster structure with a weakly coupled @xmath1-particle in the dominant @xmath33-wave component . in the present calculation using only central forces , the three - range mn force and the sb potential with the pure - serber character can reproduce the ground - state and excitation energies of @xmath200 within an accuracy of 100 - 200 kev .",

    "although these energies are rather similar , the effect of partial waves higher than the @xmath33-wave is very different ; i.e. , 0.7 mev in the ali - bodmer case and 1.5 mev in the bfw case .",
    "it is natural that the @xmath3 interactions which yield an oscillatory behavior of the @xmath3 relative wave functions , like our rgm kernel and the bfw potential , need more partial waves with a larger energy gain .",
    "there are still many problems left for the future studies .",
    "first of all , the readjustment of the @xmath208 attractive part of the sb @xmath4 potential is unsatisfactory from the viewpoint of using the fundamental baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "the brueckner rearrangement effect in @xmath209 is fairly large even for the rather stable @xmath6-cluster @xcite . in this sense",
    ", there is still no consistent description of the @xmath210-shell and @xmath18-shell hypernuclei even at the level of using effective baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "a microscopic description of the @xmath5 interaction may need a more detailed analysis based on the @xmath28-matrix theory , for which the folding formula given in appendix b is very useful . in order to describe the @xmath200 excited states realistically",
    ", we need to introduce the @xmath5 spin - orbit force and solve the faddeev equation in the @xmath64-coupling scheme .",
    "the recent @xmath23-ray spectroscopy experiment @xcite indicates a very small spin - orbit splitting for the possible @xmath24 and @xmath25 resonances .",
    "it is interesting to examine the @xmath63 components of the quark - model @xmath4 interaction , in which the antisymmetric @xmath63 interaction ( @xmath211 ) is by about a factor two larger than in the nijmegen models .",
    "we expect a large cancellation between the ordinary @xmath63 interaction and this @xmath211 interaction .",
    "an interesting application of the present faddeev formalism and the @xmath5 @xmath10-matrix derived in this study is to the recent nagara event @xcite for @xmath212 . for the @xmath43 interaction",
    ", we can use the coupled - channel @xmath43-@xmath213-@xmath214 @xmath198-matrix of the quark - model interaction , fss2 .",
    "a preliminary result @xcite shows that fss2 is at present the only model which can reproduce an appropriate strength of the @xmath43 interaction , @xmath215 mev , deduced from the nagara event . in a separate paper @xcite",
    ", we will also report another application of the present three - cluster faddeev formalism to the hypertriton system , in which the quark - model @xmath11 and @xmath17 interactions are explicitly used in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 coupled - channel faddeev formalism .",
