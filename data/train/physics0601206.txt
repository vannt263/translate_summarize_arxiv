    "the electron cloud effect ( ece ) may cause beam instabilities in accelerator structures with intense positively charged bunched beams , and it is expected to be an issue for the positron damping ring ( dr ) of the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "reduction of the secondary electron yield ( sey ) of the beam pipe inner wall is effective in controlling cloud formation .",
    "we have previously measured the secondary electron emission ( see ) from a number of technical surfaces and coatings used in ring construction @xcite , including uncoated aluminium alloys @xcite . here , we present sey ( @xmath0 ) measurements , after various treatments including ion bombardment , on ticn , tin and two differently - deposited non - evaporable getter ( neg ) tizrv films on aluminium substrates .",
    "all samples were produced at lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) .",
    "the system used to measure the sey is described in detail in @xcite . measuring techniques included x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and residual gas analysis ( rga ) .",
    "sample processing facilities were heating and ion bombardment .    the sey ( @xmath0 ) definition is determined from equation  ( [ equdefinition ] ) . in practice equation  ( [ equsey ] ) is used because it contains parameters directly measured in the retarding target potential experiment .",
    "@xmath1    @xmath2    i@xmath3 is the primary current ( the current leaving the electron gun and impinging on the surface of the sample ) and i@xmath4 is the total current measured on the sample ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "i@xmath6 is the secondary electron current leaving the target .",
    "the sey is measured , at normal incidence , by using a gun capable of delivering an electron beam of 0 - 3  kev , working at a set current of 2  na and having a 0.4  mm@xmath7 spot size on the target .",
    "the measurement of the sey is done while biasing the sample to -20  v. this retarding field repels most secondaries from adjacent parts of the system that are excited by the elastically reflected primary beam .",
    "the primary beam current as a function of the primary beam energy is measured and recorded each time before an sey measurement , by biasing the target to + 150  v , and with the same step in energy for the electron beam .",
    "a fresh current lookup table is created with each measurement .",
    "the sey measurement , over the 0 - 3  kev range , takes around 5  minutes .    in order to study the effect of ion bombardment on the sey",
    ", we used a micro - focussing scanning gas ion gun ( leybold iqe 12/38 ) .",
    "the gun has two differentially - pumped beam formation stages that reduce the sample system pressure compared to that inside the gun s electron - impact ionization chamber ( into which the gas is directly - injected ) .",
    "ion energies from 250 - 5000 ev are possible .",
    "five nines - pure hydrogen or nitrogen gases were used in this particular set of experiments . in an accelerator ,",
    "the ions produced by beam ionization of residual gases , have a spread in energy . in one of the ilc damping ring designs ( 6  km )",
    ", the impact energy of the ions is around 140  ev @xcite .",
    "our ion gun is not designed to work below 250  ev ; therefore , we have set the energy of the test ions to be 250  ev .",
    "the modest increase in ion energy will raise the nitrogen ion ( momentum ) and hydrogen ion ( chemical ) sputter yields from 0.1 to 0.15 , for removing hydrocarbon contamination @xcite .",
    "the outermost layers of the aluminium are composed of hydrocarbons and water on top of native oxide .",
    "all three materials raise the secondary yield @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen momentum sputter yield is lower for the native aluminum oxide than for the loosely - bound hydrocarbons and water ; however , metal oxides are removable by the hydrogen chemical sputtering @xcite . in our setup",
    ", the conditioning ions , hydrogen and nitrogen , are impacting onto the sample surface at an angle of 35  @xmath8 from the sample normal , with an ion density of @xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11s@xmath12 .",
    "this rate is 8  na on 1 `` ( 2.54  cm ) diameter sample ] the expected species content of the beam , for an electron - impact source using h@xmath13 or n@xmath13 , is 50% charged ( mostly single - charge diatomic ) and 50% charge - exchanged energetic neutrals @xcite .",
    "however , the beams will be referred to as ' ' h@xmath14 `` or ' ' n@xmath14 \" .",
    ".measurement history of air - exposed thin film samples .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabseyelectrondose ]    it is also not excluded that heavier ions ( n@xmath14 vs. h@xmath14 ) may be more efficient in conditioning than lighter ions , at least in the case of tizrv ( fig.[figtizrvsey ] ) . for a dose of 0.96  @xmath15 ,",
    "the @xmath16 of the tizrv is already below 1.2 .",
    "it might also be interesting to now study the effect of co ion - bombardment vs. co residual gas adsorption . based on physical sputtering",
    ", conditioning should occur .",
    "however , the possibility of surface oxidation by dissociation of the co could increase the sey .",
    "exposure to background co alone does increase the sey @xcite ; however , there will be competition for the case of h@xmath14/co@xmath17 ion - sputtering vs. co vacuum recontamination , as is the case for a circulating positron beam .",
