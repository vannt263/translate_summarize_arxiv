    "zhang and hu @xcite pioneered the study of landau levels on four- and higher - dimensional spheres and other compact manifolds by coupling fermions to gauge potentials of non - abelian monopoles @xcite .",
    "recently , landau levels ( lls ) in three- and higher dimensional flat continuum space have also been discussed @xcite . in 3d and 4d ,",
    "their hamiltonians describe spin-@xmath3 fermions in an su(2 ) gauge potential , which were constructed from harmonic oscillators with certain spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",
    "the corresponding landau level wave functions are the same as those of harmonic oscillators , but they are reorganized by the soc term to exhibit non - trivial topology . in the symmetric - type @xmath0(@xmath1 ) gauge , the 3d and 4d rotational symmetries are explicitly maintained with exactly flat energy spectra and degenerate angular momenta .",

    "the reduced 1d aubry - andre - harper model belongs to the bdi class @xcite and the bulk spectra show weyl points . again",
    "the flux in this model is complex , and the realized time - reversal symmetry satisfies @xmath120 ; while , in our case the time - reversal symmetry satisfies @xmath121 because of the kramers degeneracy based on the su(2 ) structure . in other words ,",
    "the time - reversal symmetry in our case is in in the symplectic class ; while , it is in the orthogonal class in ref . .",
    "next we discuss possible experimental realizations of the 3d su(2 ) hofstadter problem . in refs .",
    ", the 3d su(2 ) landau level problems in the continuum have been proposed to be realized in strained semiconductor systems . nevertheless , as in the case of the u(1 )",
    "hofstadter problem , the characteristic length scale of landau level states is too long compared with the lattice constant and thus the lattice effect can be neglected .",
    "the recent development of ultra - cold atom physics provides a promising opportunity to realize the su(2 ) hofstadter problem .",
    "based on the available experimental techniques , such as laser assistant tunneling and shaken lattices , which realized the u(1 ) hofstadter problem @xcite , it is natural to expect that the 3d su(2 ) hofstadter problem can also be studied experimentally in the near future .",
    "basically , these techniques need to be extended to spin - dependent hopping or shaking . for a given direction ,",
    "the associated spin eigenstates are addressed oppositely , such that they acquire opposite phases maintaining time - reversal symmetry . in principle",
    ", different spin eigenstates correspond to different internal states of atoms , which have different responses to external lasers , and thus the above spin - dependent manipulations can be realized .",
    "the key difficulty is that spin eigen - directions are orthogonal along @xmath17 and @xmath18-bonds due to their non - abelian nature .",
    "these could be realized by different sets of laser beams that control hoppings along the @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions separately , and their effects could be superposed together .",
    "along each direction , the spin eigenstates are chosen according to orthogonal pauli matrices , respectively .",
    "nevertheless careful designs are still needed to achieve the desired su(2 ) hofstadter hamiltonian .",
    "in summary , we have constructed the time - reversal invariant 3d hofstadter problem based on the 3d su(2 ) landau levels in the landau - type gauge .",
    "this lattice model provides an @xmath7 generalization of the usual 2d hofstadter problem in a magnetic field . for each pair of in plane momenta @xmath122 ,",
    "this system is reduced to 1d described by a generalized @xmath7 harper equation with a helicity structure .",
    "different from its continuum version , this lattice system possesses 3d translation symmetry as characterized by the periodic spin - dependent potential in the @xmath7 harper equation . hence , quantitative analysis of the nontrivial @xmath2 band topology",
    "is performed . in the energy spectra",
    "studied in this paper , boundary states with opposite lattice helicity structures are spatially separated at different boundaries ; @xmath2 non - trivial helical boundary fermi surface are found and consistent with the @xmath2 bulk band topology analyzed based on the parity eigenvalues of the bulk wave functions .",
    "the transition of the band topology from a weak topological insulator to a strong one is also investigated .",
