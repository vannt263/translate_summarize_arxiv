    "however , the formation and evolution of such systems is unclear .",
    "several studies have concluded that a large fraction of giant spiral and other early  type galaxies were already in place by moderate redshifts @xcite and that the characteristic galaxy size has changed little since @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , little discernible evolution is evident in such systems even when uncertainties in the morphological classification and other selection effects are included @xcite , which reinforces the conclusion that some fraction of the hubble  sequence galaxy population had assembled by @xmath2 .",
    "how these large , symmetric hubble  sequence galaxies form and assemble their diverse stellar populations remains enigmatic .",

    "this is partly due to difficulties in comparing the properties of galaxies observed at different rest ",
    "frame wavelengths and with different telescope and detector combinations .",
    "it is entirely expected that all observable galaxy properties ( e.g. , luminosities , colors , masses , morphologies , densities ) evolve substantially over galaxies lifetimes , and the subsequent observational biases further frustrate studies of galaxy evolution when examining galaxy populations based on some selection criteria .",
    "one complication in the studies of galaxy morphology results from the fact that a fixed bandpass samples lower rest  frame wavelengths with increasing redshift .",
    "for example , observations at optical wavelengths probe only the rest ",

    "object catalogs were constructed using sextractor @xcite by detecting objects in a combined @xmath27 image and measuring fluxes through matched apertures in all individual bands . as in stanford et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we will refer to the complete galaxy catalog as the hdf nicmos mosaic , or hnm , catalog .",
    "relative photometry from the _ hst _  wfpc2 and nicmos data was measured through matched elliptical apertures defined using the radial moments of each galaxies f110w + f160w light profile ( i.e. , the sextractor mag_auto flux measurements ) .",
    "the difference between the flux measured in the total ( mag_auto ) apertures and the isophotal ( mag_iso ) apertures has a median value of @xmath28% for all of the galaxies with @xmath29 .    in this work ,",
    "we define two galaxy samples from the hdf  n  data selected on the basis of redshift and limiting magnitude : a moderate  redshift sample , @xmath0 ( with a mean redshift @xmath30 ) ; and a high  redshift sample , @xmath1 ( with a mean redshift @xmath31 ) .",
    "we have used the most complete collection of hdf - n spectroscopic redshifts known ( see dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ; and references therein ) . for the remaining galaxies ,",
    "we have used the photometric  redshift catalog of @xcite for the hdf ",
    "n  based on the combined wfpc2 and nicmos data .    because we analyze the two - dimensional galaxy appearances , we have selected galaxies on the basis of signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) down to a limiting isophotal level , which is more appropriate than a pure , flux  limited sample as galaxies of larger sizes have lower s / n for a fixed flux density .",
    "we also select the objects in the bandpass that approximately corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath32band emission .",
    "we select all galaxies at @xmath2 with @xmath33 within a limiting isophote above @xmath34  mag  arcsec@xmath35 .",
    "similarly , we select galaxies at @xmath4 with @xmath36 within a limiting isophote above @xmath37  mag  arcsec@xmath35 .",
    "our tests have shown that these limits on object s / n within an isophotal aperture are reasonable for measuring galaxy morphological and structural parameters ( see p03 and discussion below ) . these limits in s / n correspond to approximate magnitude limits measured within the elliptical apertures ( i.e. , the sextractor mag_auto ) of @xmath38 .",
    "the final galaxy samples have 113 objects at @xmath2 and 53 objects at @xmath6 that satisfy these selection criteria in s / n and redshift . of the samples , 69% of the @xmath2 galaxies and 62% of the @xmath4 galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts . in the following analysis",
    ", we also compare the properties of the galaxy samples down to a fixed absolute magnitude , @xmath39 , where both samples are mostly complete ( see dickinson et al .",
    "this luminous sub  sample contains 41 objects at @xmath2 and 46 objects at @xmath4 .    the redshift ranges used here were chosen to take advantage of two attributes of the data .",
    "the apparent galaxy size remains roughly constant for @xmath40 because the angular ",
    "diameter distance  the ratio of an object s physical size to its angular size  changes little ( @xmath41% ) for the default cosmology : from 7.1  kpc arcsec@xmath23 at @xmath42 to 8.5  kpc arcsec@xmath23 at @xmath43 ( this is generally true for any plausible cosmology ) .",
    "thus , the _ hst _",
    "images provide roughly constant angular resolution of @xmath44  kpc for all the galaxies in this dataset nearly independent of redshift .",
    "note , however , that the co - moving volume contained in the redshift slice @xmath1 is 2.3 times than contained by @xmath0 .",
    "the other advantage comes from the fact that at these redshifts combinations of the wfpc2 and nicmos bandpasses probe approximately the same wavelengths in the rest  frame , which allows us to minimize morphological @xmath18corrections between the two samples .",
    "we broadly define two rest  frame wavelength regions : the mid  uv ( @xmath45   ) , and optical ( @xmath46   ) . for the @xmath47 galaxy sample ,",
    "the mid - uv , and optical  wavelength regions correspond to the  and  bandpasses , whereas at @xmath48 these rest  frame wavelength regions correspond to the and  bandpasses .",
    "we note that using a single bandpass to track a specific rest  frame wavelength for a wide redshift interval does induce overlap in wavelength and redshift coverage due to the width and central wavelengths of the of the _ hst _  filter curves .",
    "for example , due to its large width , the centroid of the  filter samples @xmath49",
    "  for @xmath50 , and @xmath51    at @xmath52 . one could devise a method to interpolate the observed bandpasses to acquire the flux at a common wavelength .",
    "however , this would in principle hinder the analysis here , as one of the goals of this work is to contrast and compare the individual color features of galaxies for common rest ",
    "frame wavelengths .",
    "interpolation between bands would only suppress any intrinsic signal .",
    "therefore , we have opted to use the fixed bandpasses as approximate surrogates for the rest  frame colors .",
    "furthermore , our tests on the uv  optical colors of local galaxies ( p03 ) has shown that the internal color dispersion is most sensitive to changes due to the the heterogeneity of the stars that contribute to the flux redward and blueward of the balmer and 4000  breaks . for the galaxies considered here",
    ", these breaks are always confined between the chosen bandpasses .",
    "figures  [ fig : montage_lowz1 ] and [ fig : montage_hiz1 ] show images of the 28 most luminous galaxies ( in the rest  frame @xmath32band ) in each of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 samples .",
    "these figures illustrate the morphologies of the brightest galaxy members of each sample .",
    "although the galaxies in each sample span comparable rest  frame luminosities , @xmath53 , their morphologies are distinctly different .",
    "many of the galaxies at @xmath2 have regular and symmetric morphologies , particularly in the rest - frame optical images , and are similar to `` normal '' hubble  sequence galaxies .",
    "our by  eye classification of the @xmath54 morphologies finds that of the brightest @xmath2 galaxies @xmath55% ( 12/28 ) have elliptical , lenticular , or spheroidal morphologies ( hnm 144 , 789 , 847 , 886 , 1014 , 1091 , 1031 , 1214 , 1356 , 1418 , 1453 , 1523 ) , @xmath55% ( 12/28 ) have spiral or disk morphologies ( hnm 214 , 388 , 448 , 577 , 779 , 1120 , 1168 , 1213 , 1240 , 1348 , 1488 , 1525 ) , and only @xmath56% ( 4/28 ) have irregular or compact morphologies ( hnm 333 , 360 , 909 , 1316 ) .",
    "many of the objects show strong differences between their morphologies at uv and optical wavelengths ( i.e. , strong morphological @xmath18corrections ) , which is particularly apparent in those galaxies with spiral and/or disk morphologies .",
    "in contrast , the brightest galaxies at @xmath4 have either irregular ( hnm 552 , 1357 , 163 , 1358 , 813 , 814 , 1513 , 109 , 850 , 758 , 701 , 502 , 804 ) or compact morphologies ( hnm 110 661 , 843 , 466 , 274 , 741 , 62 , 67 , 1047 , 1550 , 503 , 229 , 272 , 230 , 1199 ) . unlike the galaxies at @xmath2 , there are no galaxies with disk  like or spiral  galaxy morphologies at @xmath4 : no galaxies show evidence for spiral arms or for being edge  on disk systems .",
    "this is broadly similar to the morphological descriptions of @xmath57 galaxies based solely on rest ",
    "frame uv observations @xcite .",
    "the majority of the optically bright galaxies at @xmath4 have similar morphologies in the  ( rest  frame 1500   ) and  ( rest  frame 4400   ) , which is even more significant because this wavelength baseline is longer than that shown for the @xmath2 sample in figure  [ fig : montage_lowz1 ] . the lack of significant morphological @xmath18correction combined with the fact that these galaxies have blue uv  optical colors ( dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ) implies that recent star formation dominates the uv  optical morphologies , which we discuss in more detail below ( see also the discussion in p03 ) .",
    "the panels in figures  [ fig : montage_lowz1 ] and [ fig : montage_hiz1 ] show the images of the @xmath2 and 2.3 galaxies at the same physical scale ( i.e. , each panel is approximately 40  kpc @xmath58  40  kpc ) .",

    ", we find 24 galaxies at @xmath2 and 8 at @xmath4 .",

    "thus the strong size evolution that exists between galaxies at @xmath4 and 1 is robust against surface ",
    "brightness dimming effects .",
    "this fact that the @xmath1 redshift range contains more co - moving volume than that at @xmath0 actually strengthens the significance of the result .",

    "we subtract the contribution from background regions ( i.e. , image sections with no detected sources ) in each image @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",

    "both properties of the data will tend to suppress inter  pixel noise .",

    "we therefore conclude that the increase in the internal color dispersion between @xmath4 to 1 corresponds to greater diversity in the amounts of young and old stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "the best example of this behavior in the @xmath2 hdf ",
    "n  sample is the giant , `` grand  design '' spiral galaxy , hnm 1488 ( see figures  [ fig : montage_lowz1 ] and [ fig : montage_xi_lowz ] ) . bulge and possible bar features dominate the rest  frame @xmath32band ( image ) . in the rest",
    "frame uv ( ) , these features fade relative to the disk , spiral arms , and prominent star  forming knots embedded in the disk .",
    "the redder bulge dominates the rest - frame optical light , giving a red total color , @xmath184 .",
    "the internal color dispersion is very high , @xmath185 , and arises primarily from the color differences between the bulge , disk , and regions ( figure  [ fig : montage_xi_lowz ] ) .",
    "based on the models , these three features are required to produce both the red total color and high internal color dispersion .",
    "the different galaxy components described in the simulations above have very different stellar - mass  to  blue - light ratios , as indicated in table  [ table : models ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : sim_massratio ] shows the internal color dispersion of the models as a function of the relative amount of stellar mass in the different model components . for the disk models listed in table  [ table : models ] , the stellar mass of the bulge exceeds that in the disk by up to a factor of @xmath186 when the luminosities of the bulge and disk are equal , and the internal color dispersion reaches a maximum near this point .",
    "based on figure  [ fig : sim_massratio ] , high values of the internal color dispersion ( @xmath170 ) occur when @xmath187% of the stellar mass resides in recently formed stars ( see also p03 ) .",
    "the increase in range of the uv  optical internal color dispersion coincides with the emergence of large , early and mid  type hubble  sequence galaxies . for example",
    ", @xcite and @xcite have shown that galaxy morphological type is generally distinguished by their concentration and asymmetry indexes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if the formation of hubble  sequence galaxies corresponds to an increase in the scatter of the uv  optical color dispersion , then one expects there to be a relation between the internal color dispersion and these morphological indicators .",
    "figure  [ fig : ca ] shows the concentration and asymmetry values along with internal color dispersion for the two hdf ",
    "n  samples @xcite . at @xmath4",
    "galaxies with high uv  optical internal color dispersion occupy the upper range of asymmetry values , which is indicative of irregular star  forming galaxies possibly due to interactions and mergers @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the internal color dispersion results from variations in the stellar populations and dust opacity , e.g. , hnm 813 + 814 ( see figures  [ fig : montage_hiz1 ] and [ fig : montage_xi_hiz ] ) . because galaxies with relatively high internal color dispersion correspond to highly asymmetric galaxies , this supports the notion that they are strongly interacting and/or merging . at @xmath2 galaxies with high internal color dispersion span a range of morphological types as traced by concentration and asymmetry .",
    "there is still a group of galaxies with high internal color dispersion and high asymmetry .",
    "these objects are similar to the higher redshift star  forming galaxies , and is consistent with a recent analysis of _ hst_/acs images , which suggests that star - forming galaxies at @xmath188 and 4 have similar far  uv ( 1500   ) morphologies ( lotz et al.2005 ) .",
    "there are also a large number of galaxies with low asymmetry , and higher concentration , which suggest that the high internal color dispersion in these objects occurs in otherwise normal mid / early  type galaxies .",
    "it seems that the emergence of hubble  sequence galaxies coincides with larger internal color dispersion , and thus the assembly of diverse , spatially segregated stellar populations .",
    "two of the galaxies , hnm 1214 and 1453 , are classified as early  types by high concentration and low asymmetry , and also have moderately high internal color dispersion ( @xmath189 ) . upon visual inspection in both cases very faint blue companions are visible at distances of @xmath190 , which were not split by sextractor and increase the internal color dispersion . the companion near hnm 1214 is visible roughly one arcsecond to the left of the galaxy in figure  [ fig : montage_lowz1 ] .",
    "companions only affect the internal color dispersion in very few of objects ( these two and hnm 1453 , which was eliminated from the sample for this reason , see   [ section : icd ] ) . the large internal color dispersion in the majority of objects results from spatially segregated heterogeneous stellar populations .",
    "many of the @xmath2 galaxies have red total colors that are consistent with the passively evolving stellar  population models with ages older than @xmath192  gyr . because these ages are greater than the elapsed cosmic time from @xmath4 to 1 , some of the stellar populations currently in @xmath2 galaxies must have been present in progenitors at the earlier epoch .",
    "however , due to the large growth in galaxy stellar mass and size over these redshifts , the @xmath2 galaxies were generally not fully formed by @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to evolution in size and mass , the increase in the range of galaxy internal color dispersion from @xmath4 to 1 is evidence that the diversity in the stellar populations in galaxies is increasing .",
    "papovich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that the relatively short ages of galaxies at @xmath193 ( less than a few hundred megayears ) coupled with the lack of older faded `` post - burst '' remnants implied that these galaxies have recurring star  formation episodes .",
    "the time scales of these episodes correspond to @xmath194  gyr such that the newly  formed stellar populations dominate the rest ",
    "frame uv  optical wavelength regions of the galaxy seds .",
    "one can not exclude the possibility that older ( and possibly more heterogeneous ) stellar populations are hidden beneath the `` glare '' of the young stars .",
    "this is broadly consistent with small range of low internal color dispersion observed in the @xmath4 sample , but with the additional constraint that the nascent stellar populations in these galaxies dominate both the total galaxy colors and the internal galaxy colors , at least over scales of @xmath195  kpc ( the nicmos resolution at these redshifts ) .",
    "if either recurrent bursts such as those described above or quasi  constant star formation is the norm for galaxies at @xmath6 , then eventually these galaxies will form sufficient stellar mass , which will dominate the emitted optical luminosity .",
    "strong uv ",
    "optical internal color dispersion generally requires that @xmath196% of the total stellar mass resides in older stellar populations ( see   [ section : models ] ) . at @xmath197 ,",
    "the age of the universe is less than 3  gyr , and thus there has been little opportunity for enough star ",
    "formation events to have instilled strong heterogeneity in the galaxies stellar populations . at @xmath2 the age of the universe roughly doubles to @xmath198  gyr , which permits a greater number of star ",
    "formation episodes with this timescale and allows for greater internal color dispersion .",
    "the increase in the internal color dispersion for @xmath4 to 1 seems to require that enough time has elapsed for galaxies to have formed a sufficient amount of their stellar mass relative to their current star ",
    "formation rate such that the older stars dominate the optical luminosity .",
    "the discussion above ignores the effects of dust extinction in star  forming regions , which can contribute to the overall `` patchiness '' in galaxy internal colors and produce strong morphological @xmath18corrections @xcite .",
    "however , studies of the variation in internal colors @xcite and the internal color dispersion of local galaxies ( p03 ) broadly conclude that these diagnostics are more sensitive to variations in the ages of the galaxy stellar populations relative to variable dust opacity . therefore , we attribute the strong variation in galaxy internal color dispersion primarily to differences in the ages of the galaxy stellar populations .    because the half ",
    "light radius is growing from @xmath4 to 1 ( see   [ section : sizes ] ) , we know that galaxies do not form _ in situ _ and evolve passively over this redshift range .",
    "furthermore , as the size increases , galaxies at later epochs will have proportionally more young stars at larger radii .",
    "so , size evolution will naturally lead to color gradients .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the @xmath2 galaxies with the largest internal color dispersion appear to have red centrally concentrated cores with bluer regions at larger radii ( see figure  [ fig : montage_xi_lowz ] ) .",
    "although the large internal color dispersion values at @xmath2 imply a large stellar diversity at this epoch , the same is not the case at @xmath4 .",
    "based on the simple models presented in   [ section : models ] , although there is sufficient time at @xmath129 for galaxies to have developed a heterogeneous stellar content with significant internal color dispersion , none is observed ( see , for example , figure  [ fig : colorvxi_models ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that galaxies at @xmath7 are _ not _ forming a diverse stellar content as rapidly as is allowed purely from timescale arguments .",
    "this implies that galaxies at these epochs are not assembling their stellar populations in the quasi  continuous , inside - out models described in ",
    "[ section : models ] .",
    "one alternative to account for the fact that the @xmath4 galaxies do not exhibit strong internal color dispersion is that intense , discrete starbursts such as those associated with actively merging galaxies dominate the star ",
    "formation histories at this epoch .",
    "intense starbursts naturally dominate the uv  optical light at the time the galaxy is observed , which accounts for the observed properties of the galaxies at @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if these starbursts arise from strong interactions or mergers , then during the merger one expects some internal color dispersion to result from any previously formed , heterogeneous stellar populations with some contribution from varying dust opacity ( see , e.g. , the large heterogeneity in both the stellar populations and dust extinction in ngc 4038/4039 ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the merger process will tend to erase any diversity in the constituent stellar  populations by fully mixing them on short timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus the merger product should have largely homogenized stellar populations .",
    "this is consistent with the small derived values for the internal color dispersion at @xmath4 .",
    "the period while galaxies are strongly interacting and/or actively merging may produce patchy star formation with larger internal color dispersion .",
    "indeed , the objects at @xmath6 with high internal color dispersion ( @xmath200 ) have large asymmetries ( figure  [ fig : ca ] ) , supporting the hypothesis that they are actively merging .",
    "we therefore interpret the observations as evidence for major mergers associated with strong starbursts .",
    "furthermore , these events probably occur frequently , with the timescale between bursts @xmath194  gyr , in order to keep the stellar content in these galaxies homogenized and to keep the total uv  optical colors dominated by the young starburst .    by @xmath2 the internal color dispersion in galaxies",
    "has increased significantly , which we interpret as an increase in the diversity of galaxies stellar content .",
    "this occurs partly because galaxies have formed sufficient mass in older stellar populations that recent star forming episodes contribute less to the total optical emission ( while still dominating the uv light ; see the discussion above ) .",
    "however , the heterogeneous stellar populations are spatially segregated : the @xmath2 galaxies with the highest internal color dispersion typically have red central cores surrounded by bluer regions ( see figure  [ fig : montage_xi_lowz ] ) .",
    "this signifies that major mergers occur less frequently , because any merger activity would tend to erase this diversity in the configuration of the stellar populations .",
    "the growth of large disks at this epoch naturally increases the internal color dispersion , and is consistent with the interpretation of the ubiquitousness of thick disks in local galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the emergence of galaxies with large internal color dispersion signifies great diversity in their stellar content , and we interpret this as evidence for a decline in the major  merger rate in galaxies at @xmath201 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the decline in the importance of bursts with decreasing redshift may imply that more quiescent modes dominate the total star  formation rate .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion by van den bergh ( 2002 ) and reminiscent of the `` collisional starburst '' models of somerville et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , where bursts dominate at high redshifts , and quiescent star formation dominates at lower redshifts ( @xmath202 )",
    ". the larger range of internal color dispersion for the massive galaxies at @xmath2 implies that quiescent star  formation plays a more dominant role at later times compared to major mergers .",
    "the transition between where these modes dominate occurs between @xmath203 .",
    "we have studied the evolution in the morphologies and colors of two samples of high  redshift galaxies at @xmath4 and @xmath2 in order to investigate how these galaxies assembled their stellar populations . from @xmath4 to 1 , galaxies grow in size , stellar mass , total color , and internal color dispersion , which we interpret as evidence for an increase in the diversity of stellar populations as galaxies assemble .",
    "the majority of luminous galaxies ( @xmath3 in the rest frame ) in the @xmath2 sample have rest  frame optical morphologies that are classifiable as early  to  mid hubble types .",
    "these galaxies have regular , symmetric morphologies , and many show strong transformations between their morphologies when viewed at rest  frame uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , the rest ",
    "frame optical morphologies of the luminous ( @xmath204 in the rest ",
    "frame ) galaxies at @xmath4 are irregular and/or compact , and there is little difference in the galaxy morphologies from rest  frame far  uv to optical wavelengths .",
    "none of the @xmath4 galaxies appear to be normal hubble  sequence galaxies . because the @xmath4 galaxies show little transformation in morphology from rest ",
    "frame uv to optical wavelengths , the uv components are not generally the small , star  forming pieces within larger host galaxies .    the mean galaxy size increases from @xmath4 to 1 by roughly 40% , in broad agreement with expectations from hierarchical models .",
    "furthermore , the number density of large galaxies , @xmath71  kpc and @xmath99 , increases by a factor of @xmath5 .",
    "we have tested that the size evolution is robust against surface ",
    "brightness dimming effects . the half",
    " light radii of the @xmath2 galaxies when simulated at @xmath92 decrease by @xmath78% compared to their measured values at @xmath2 , but this decrease is small compared to the observed evolution .",
    "the radius ",
    "luminosity distribution of galaxies at @xmath2 is consistent with the local distribution for pure luminosity evolution .",
    "however , the size ",
    "luminosity , and size  mass distributions of @xmath4 galaxies indicate that they are not the fully formed progenitors of large , present  day galaxies .",
    "galaxies at @xmath7 must continue to build , both in terms of size and stellar mass .",
    "we have analyzed the rest ",
    "frame uv  optical total colors , and the internal color dispersion using the novel statistic developed in p03 .",
    "the internal color dispersion quantifies differences in galaxy morphology as a function of wavelength , and between rest ",
    "frame uv and optical wavelengths it constrains the amount of current star ",
    "formation relative to the older stellar populations .",
    "both the mean and scatter of total color and the internal color dispersion increase from @xmath4 to 1 . at @xmath2 , galaxies with high internal color span a range of morphological types . many are spiral galaxies , with a few starbursting and interacting systems .",
    "there is no clear correlation between total color and the internal color dispersion , although galaxies with the highest internal color dispersion have moderate total uv  optical colors , which implies a mix of heterogeneous stellar populations .",
    "the @xmath2 galaxies with the highest internal color dispersion appear to be early  to  mid - type spiral galaxies , and they exhibit strong transformations between their uv and optical rest  frame morphologies .",
    "at @xmath4 few galaxies have high internal color dispersion , and those that do also have interacting and disturbed morphologies , which implies that the uv  optical light from these galaxies is dominated by young , largely homogeneous stellar populations .",
    "we interpret the evolution in galaxy color and internal color dispersion as evidence that the diversity in the stellar populations of galaxies is increasing from @xmath4 to 1 as the older stellar components build up over time .",
    "to interpret the evolution in the properties of galaxies , we have modeled the stellar populations of galaxies in spheroidal and disk components , and star  forming regions .",
    "these simple models broadly support the conclusion that the range of internal color dispersion corresponds to increased diversity in the galaxies stellar populations .",
    "galaxies with significant bulge components with star ",
    "forming disks and/or compact , regions produce high internal color dispersion , and broadly reproduce the colors , sizes , and internal color dispersion of the high  redshift galaxies .",
    "we find that large values of the internal color dispersion require galaxy to have formed spatially segregated , diverse stellar populations where old stars dominate the optical light and stellar mass ( i.e. , @xmath196% of the stellar mass resides in stars @xmath205  gyr ) . for smaller fractions of old stars ,",
    "young stellar populations dominate the uv  optical internal colors .",
    "the scatter in the internal color dispersion of the @xmath4 galaxies is smaller than what is allowed under these models and basic timescale arguments .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that brief , discrete and recurrent starburst episodes dominate the star  formation history of galaxies at this epoch . if these arise from strong interactions or mergers of gas  rich constituents , then they will erase any heterogeneity in the stellar content that otherwise develops , and this is supported by the low internal color dispersion observed in galaxies at this epoch .",
    "the greater range of internal color dispersion that forms at @xmath2 suggests that major mergers are less frequent and more quiescent star ",
