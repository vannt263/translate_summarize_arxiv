    "in density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , the density scaling is a key concept and was used along the years to derive many exact constraints @xcite , as well as useful virial relations @xcite for the kinetic , exchange and correlation energy functionals .",

    "are nowadays designed to satisfy the uniform scaling relation @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the _ two - dimensional nonuniform scaling of the density _ defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , hence @xmath27 , under which the system approaches the 1d limit when @xmath28 .",
    "although there are important conditions for both kohn - sham exchange and correlation energies under this scaling @xcite , they are not satisfied by any popular xc functional ( to our knowledge ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the _ one - dimensional nonuniform scaling of the density _ defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , hence @xmath31 , under which the system approaches the 2d limit when @xmath28 .",
    "this density scaling , that is related to the dimensional crossover of the xc energy ( from 3d to 2d ) @xcite , has been recently incorporated in a semilocal xc functional , named q2d - generalized - gradient - approximation ( q2d - gga ) @xcite , constructed for mild and strong quasi-2d regimes .",
    "the remarkable performance of the q2d - gga for surface energies and lattice constants of transition metals , showed the power of the one - dimensional nonuniform scaling .    in this paper we consider a different type of scaling for the density and focus the attention on the family of scaling relations of the form @xmath32 where @xmath0 is a parameter .",

    "the trasformation of the statistical weights , connected to scaling transformations of the type defined in eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , can be defined explicitly in two separate cases .",
    "when , upon scaling , the variation in the particle number is smaller than one ( i.e. , @xmath76 or similarly @xmath77 ) , the statistical weights change with @xmath78 as @xmath79 and consequently , the exact total energy functional @xmath80 $ ] varies linearly with @xmath78 @xcite @xmath81 = \\left(1-n(\\lambda-1)\\right)e[n_n]+n(\\lambda-1)e[n_{n+1}]\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote @xmath84- and @xmath85-densities .",
    "when the variation in the particle number is larger than one ( i.e. , the number of particles changes from @xmath84 to @xmath86 , with @xmath87 an integer and @xmath88 ) , the statistical weights change as @xmath89 therefore , the transformation can be seen as a chain of transformations like the one in eq .",
    "( [ etr ] ) concerning successively @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 . as a consequence ,",
    "the exact total energy functional will be described as a succession of straight lines .",
    "thus , the derivative discontinuity @xcite plays an important role for the scaling transformations , especially when @xmath84 and @xmath87 are finite .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath95 the role of derivative discontinuity is diminished and one can always consider @xmath96 . in this case",
    "the behavior of the system is closely related to the semiclassical physics , as shown in the next sections . because of the complexity of this density scaling , in this paper we mainly consider only two extreme cases of interest : when @xmath97 and @xmath9 , and the semiclassical limit @xmath28 .",
    "using the definition of eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) we can immediately find the scaling properties of several quantities which depend explicitly on the particle density .",
    "this is the case , for example , of the the coulomb energy and any external potential ( e.g. , @xmath98 with @xmath99 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath100 & = & \\lambda^{\\beta+2}j[n ] , \\\\",

    "thus , the conditions @xmath104 and @xmath108 correspond to scalings to the high- and low - density limits , respectively .",
    "the opposite is true for @xmath109 .",
    "for the special case @xmath2 instead the local seitz parameter is independent on @xmath78 and the density regime can not be modified by a scaling transformation .",
    "on the other hand , the usual density parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , with @xmath114 being the local fermi wave - vector @xcite , @xmath115 being the thomas - fermi screening wave - vector @xcite , and @xmath116 being the wave vector suitable for bonding and valence regions @xcite , scale according to @xmath117 thus , the reduced gradient and laplacian for exchange and kinetic energies ( @xmath118 and @xmath70 ) are independent on @xmath0 so that the slowly - varying density limit ( @xmath119 ) is reached whenever @xmath104 , while for @xmath108 a rapidly - varying density regime is always set up . on the contrary the density parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which are relevant for the correlation , have a dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , they can describe different density regimes depending on the actual value of the parameter @xmath0 .    because for any value of @xmath0 the reduced gradient for exchange and kinetic energy @xmath118 and the reduced laplacian @xmath70 become small in the limit @xmath28 , it is also interesting to investigate the scaling behavior of local density approximations ( lda ) and gradient expansions for the non - interacting kinetic energy and the exchange energy .",
    "these expressions will in fact become almost exact in the limit @xmath28 .",

    "<S> we discuss a @xmath0-dependent family of electronic density scalings of the form @xmath1 in the context of density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider the following special cases : the thomas - fermi scaling ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , which is crucial for the semiclassical theory of neutral atoms ; the uniform - electron - gas scaling ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , that is important in the semiclassical theory of metallic clusters ; the homogeneous density scaling ( @xmath6 ) which can be related to the self - interaction problem in density functional theory when @xmath7 ; the fractional scaling ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , that is important for atom and molecule fragmentation ; and the strong - correlation scaling ( @xmath10 and @xmath3 ) that is important to describe the strong correlation limit .    the results of our work provide evidence for the importance of this family of scalings in semiclassical and quantum theory of electronic systems , and indicate that these scaling properties must be considered as important constraints in the construction of new approximate density functionals . </S>",
    "<S> we also show , using the uniform - electron - gas scaling , that the curvature energy of metallic clusters is related to the second - order gradient expansion of kinetic and exchange - correlation energies . </S>"
