    "all currently available cosmological observations , including the latest datasets of cmb temperature and polarisation anisotropies @xcite , supernovae type ia ( sneia ) magnitudes @xcite and the distance ladder mapped by baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak signature in the clustering of galaxies @xcite are consistent with a simple cosmological model in which general relativity ( gr ) describes gravitational interactions on all scales and times , about 70 per cent of the universe s current energy density is in form of a cosmological constant as originally described by einstein , and most of the remaining 30 per cent is in form of nonrelativistic `` dark matter '' ( for a detailed review see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "ongoing and future observations have been designed to test if the cosmological constant needs to be replaced by a dynamical dark energy ( de ) , and if so , to measure the properties of this de fluid .",

    "observational effects of dynamic de and mg are partially degenerate and careful data analysis should take into account both possibilities @xcite .",
    "the clustering of galaxies provides a very powerful and robust test of both the nature of de and mg .",
    "the shape of the measured correlation function @xcite or the power - spectrum @xcite , analogously to the shape of the measured cmb power - spectrum @xcite , can be used to constrain basic cosmological parameters .",
    "features within the clustering signal , particularly the bao , allow the clustering to be used as a standard ruler .",
    "additionally , although the statistical properties of galaxy clustering are expected to be isotropic , the measured clustering can be highly anisotropic , depending on how redshifts are translated to distances .",
    "the two main sources of this apparent anisotropy are redshift - space distortions ( rsd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the alcock - paczynski ( ap ; * ? ? ?",

    "rsd arise because peculiar velocities contribute to observed galaxies redshifts , but can not be corrected for when computing line - of - sight separations . on quasi - linear scales ,",
    "the average pairwise galaxy peculiar velocity is negative , meaning that galaxies are on average falling towards the mass over - densities traced by neighbouring galaxies .",
    "these coherent motions appear as a `` squashing '' of the correlation function along the line - of - sight .",
    "the amplitude of the observed anisotropy can be used to infer the strength of the gravitational interaction at different scales and redshifts .",

    "rsd allow measurements of the amplitude of fluctuations in the velocity field , which in linear theory give a dependence on @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the overall normalisation of the matter density fluctuations .    the ap effect results from the fact that , to convert observed angular positions and redshifts of galaxies into physical positions , we must use a cosmological model on the observed lightcone .",
    "if the wrong model is used when computing the correlation function , the initial isotropy of the clustering signal will be distorted .",
    "the measured anisotropy of clustering can be used to infer the proper geometry and hence the true values of cosmological parameters . if we have a prior on the shape of the correlation function , the dilation of scales between the spherically averaged observed and model clustering statistics allows a measurement of @xmath18^{1/3 } ,    \\label{eq : dv}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the physical angular diameter distance and @xmath20 is the hubble expansion rate @xcite .",
    "applying the ap test to the measured direction dependent clustering additionally allows the measurement of @xmath21 this allows the degeneracy between radial and angular distances in bao measurements to be broken and an accurate estimate of hubble expansion rate at different redshifts to be derived .",
    "many rsd measurements have been made from a variety of galaxy surveys , including most recently the 2dfgrs @xcite , the vvds @xcite , the 2slaq @xcite , the sdss - ii @xcite , the wigglez @xcite , and the 6dfgrs @xcite surveys .",
    "these measurements have in turn been used to set constraints on the cosmological growth rate .",

    "by contrast , the ap test has received less attention , since better signal - to - noise data is needed to disentangle rsd and ap effects , and more careful modelling of anisotropic correlation function is required .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "@xcite used the measured anisotropic correlation function of galaxies in the cmass dr9 sample to jointly estimate @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . to obtain these estimates",
    "they fitted the monopole and quadrupole in the range of scales @xmath35 .",
    "the theoretical model correlation function was computed from the `` streaming model '' of @xcite .",
    "linear theory predictions for the anisotropic correlation function cease to be accurate on relatively large scales ( for the importance of nonlinear corrections see and different ways of modeling rsd in quasi - nonlinear regime see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the `` streaming model '' used as the theoretical basis of our cmass dr9 analysis reproduces the monopole and quadrupole measured in nbody simulations with better than 2 per cent precision down to the scales of @xmath36 ; better than the level demanded by dr9 data .",
    "appendices b3 and b4 of @xcite further quantify the ( small ) theoretical errors , including uncertainties in the `` fingers - of - god '' , using realistic mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "the shape of the linear real - space correlation function was marginalised over using a wmap7 prior on parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this triplet of parameters fixes relative clustering at different physical separations ; the geometrical measurements of @xmath40 and @xmath41 result from matching the measured shape of the galaxy correlation function to the shape fixed by cmb data while most of information about @xmath24 comes from the relative amplitudes of the measured monopole and quadrupole . @xcite",
    "considered a number of models with different assumptions about how the shape of the correlation function relates to the background geometry and growth .",
    "most relevant to this paper is the model in which the shape of the correlation function is fixed by a wmap7 prior but the expansion of the universe at lower redshifts and the growth of structure since recombination are allowed to be arbitrary ( model @xmath42 in @xcite ) .",
    "joint estimates of @xmath24 , @xmath43 and @xmath23 recovered by applying this model are independent of assumptions about either the late - time behaviour of de or the structure growth and can be used to constrain models with arbitrary de equation of state ( eos ) and growth history as long as physics at recombination is unaltered and linear growth remains scale - independent .",
    "the @xcite measurements have already been used to constrain galileon gravity @xcite and cosmic growth index @xcite .",
    "the most general way of testing de and mg models against anisotropic clustering measurements made with the cmass sample would be to fit predictions of the models to the measurements of monopole and quadrupole directly .",
    "we have checked that in all relevant cases simply assuming a 3-dimensional multi - variable gaussian likelihood around the @xmath24 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 measurements of model @xmath42 retains most of the constraining power of the data set and results in very similar constraints compared with exploring the full likelihood .",
    "in fact , while the likelihood of the measurements of @xcite is close to a multivariate gaussian , it is slightly skewed towards higher values of @xmath41 and @xmath24 .",
    "we have checked that the effect of the skewness on the derived likelihood of cosmological parameters is small and only affects regions of low likelihood ( appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "for the rest of the paper we will ignore this small effect .",
    "although the measurements of geometry and growth rate in @xcite were derived using a wmap `` shape '' prior , the resulting estimates are not correlated with the wmap parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this allows us to combine these measurements with the wmap likelihood without double - counting the cmb information .",
    "we have checked that combining model @xmath42 measurements with wmap data gives very similar likelihood surfaces as those calculated by jointly fitting the cmass dr9 monopole and quadrupole and the cmb data .",
    "this approximation allows us to greatly speed up the calculation of likelihoods for a variety of cosmological models .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      to reconstruct the model - independent properties of the late - time universe , as described in section  [ ssec : recon ] we will use the geometric @xcite measurements in combination with the previous ap constraints presented in table  [ table : hconstraints ] .",
    "these estimates were derived using different fitting methods , measurements and range of scales .",
    "we ignore these differences in our analysis and will treat the reported measured values and their errorbars as bayesian likelihoods of @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the redshifts of interest .",
    "if we assume that the universe is well described by a frw metric , the hubble rate and expansion rate and the relationship with distances can be written without a reference to a particular de model ; they can be expressed purely as functions of @xmath47 through @xmath48 where the scale factor @xmath49 is normalised such that @xmath50 today and dot denotes a time derivative .",

    "the most popular approach is to parametrize the dimensionless coordinate distance in the integral in eq .",

    "@xcite used the method of @xcite to reconstruct the comoving distance from sneia data , which , combined with their measurements of @xmath41 , enabled an estimate of @xmath20 .",
    "we will adopt an alternate approach that does not require taking derivatives of the quantities reconstructed from data , which has been shown to introduce artificial oscillations in reconstructed variables @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath51 is a smooth function of the scale factor , so that it can be approximated by a third order polynomial .",
    "we have checked that this approximation holds to a percent level for all conventional de models for wide range of redshifts ; for @xmath11cdm this expansion is exact up to the radiation dominated era .",

    "[ fig : qom ] presents the results of the reconstruction of @xmath56 using our geometric measurements from the cmass dr9 data combined with previous similar geometric measurements from 6dfgrs , sdss - ii and wigglez surveys .",
    "the reconstruction uses only the geometric measurements , shape prior from wmap7 data and theoretical priors of spatially - flat frw metric and smoothness of @xmath58 .",
    "the recovered deceleration parameter is less than zero at redshifts @xmath59 and more than @xmath60 from @xmath61 as predicted by eds model .",
    "@xcite were able to derive a much stronger constraint of @xmath62 using sneia data only , however they had to assume constant @xmath63 while we allow @xmath63 to have non - zero higher derivatives .",

    "[ fig : qom ] presents a similar reconstruction of @xmath64 parameter .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath64 is consistent with being constant and is more than @xmath65 from the eds predicted value of @xmath66 .",
    "our reconstructed @xmath56 and @xmath64 are consistent with those reconstructed by @xcite ; our results are smoother as a function of redshift because of the different reconstruction method used .",
    "our geometric measurements can be used to derive an estimate of hubble expansion rate at @xmath30 , since @xmath67 this measurement of @xmath20 combined with an independent measurement of @xmath31 can be used to estimate the increase in the fractional energy density of de with respect to nonrelativistic matter from @xmath30 to present day . if we assume a flat frw background and two dominant components @xmath68 and @xmath69 then @xmath70 combining our estimate of @xmath71 with the @xcite measurement of @xmath31 and a wmap 7 prior of @xmath72 we find @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this means that the fractional contribution of de to the total has increased by a factor of @xmath75 since @xmath30 , lending support to the notion that expansion dominated by de is a relatively recent occurrence .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the observed galaxy clustering when combined with cmb data is fully consistent with lcdmgr expectations .",
    "nevertheless , several of our fits to one - parameter extensions of flat lcdmgr ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ) indicate a @xmath13 preference for values away from the fiducial .",
    "the data , however , demand these extra parameters at a much lower significance than @xmath15 : the difference in the best fit @xmath79 values between flat lcdmgr and these one - parameter model extensions is only @xmath802.5 .",
    "a similar effect has been observed for the effective number of neutrinos ( @xmath81 in the standard model of particle physics ) , where the bayesian posterior likelihood resulting from the cmb data has been shown to prefer @xmath82 at high confidence level .",
    "the @xcite , however , showed that in this case the priors imposed on cosmological parameters have a strong effect on the posterior likelihood of @xmath83 and after removing this prior - dependency the preference for the deviation from @xmath84 is much lower .",
    "we have used the @xcite measurements of angular distance , hubble expansion rate and growth rate derived from the anisotropic clustering of boss cmass dr9 galaxies to place constraints on deviations from the standard cosmological model that assumes a @xmath11cdm background with structure formation driven by gr .",
    "the geometric measurements of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are complementary to similar measurements from the bao peak position @xcite and the full shape of the correlation function @xcite and strengthen existing constraints on parameters describing the time - dependence of de energy density .",
    "the rsd measurement of @xmath24 was shown to provide an additional constraint on the parameters describing deviations from gr and helped to significantly tighten de constraints derived from geometric measurements .",
    "we now highlight our findings by using them to answer fundamental questions about our universe .",
    "+ _ how much do rsd measurements enhance the geometric measurements ? _ + when gr is assumed the rsd measurements of growth break parameter degeneracies present when using purely geometric measurements , and consequently significantly tighten constraints on basic cosmological parameters .",
    "the addition of growth rate information improves constraints on @xmath68 by 18 per cent relative to the case where only bao peak position data is used .",
    "the improvement is most dramatic for the @xmath78 parameter constraints , which improve by a factor of four compared to bao only results ( see table  [ table : all ] ) .",
    "+ _ does gr provide a good description of data ? _ + when @xmath11cdm is assumed our measurements of growth and geometry show a @xmath15 preference for models in which the growth of structure is weaker compared to gr . adding previous rsd measurements at other redshifts",
    "brings the best - fit closer to gr value but still prefers somewhat weaker growth .",
    "this results from the fact that most rsd measurements of @xmath85 with high signal - to - noise are below gr predictions ( see fig .  [ fig : fs8 ] ) .",
    "+ _ does the cosmological constant provide a good description of data ? _ + assuming gr , our measurements of growth and geometry show a @xmath15 preference for @xmath86 . when combined with sneia data , the best - fit is closer to the cosmological constant model and the discrepancy is lowered to about @xmath46 .",
    "it should be noted that , for de as well as gr , the @xmath15 preference means a preference in terms of relative bayesian likelihood .",
    "+ _ how well can the de scalar field potential be constrained ? _ + we demonstrated that our measurements of growth and geometry , when combined with cmb information , provide strong constraints on scalar field de model parameters .",
    "the constraints obtained are better than previously reported from different combinations of data sets .",
    "the flat potential ( cosmological constant ) provides a good fit to data .",

    "we showed that current ap measurements provide @xmath87 to @xmath60 evidence for the accelerated universe at low redshifts .",
    "much stronger measurements of @xmath56 exist in the literature , but they depend on additional assumptions about the nature of de .",
    "+ _ did de emerge as a dominant component only very recently ? _ + our estimate of @xmath88 combined with an estimate of @xmath31 suggest that energy density of de relative to nonrelativistic matter was about 4.5 times lower at @xmath89 . + _ is the standard @xmath11cdmgr model still valid ?",
    "_ + measurements of growth and geometry from cmass dr9 sample allow for a very strong test of mg and de . when combined with wmap7 data they show a @xmath15 preference for either weaker gravity or @xmath86 .",

    "<S> we use the joint measurement of geometry and growth from anisotropic galaxy clustering in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) data release 9 ( dr9 ) cmass sample reported by @xcite to constrain dark energy ( de ) properties and possible deviations from the general relativity ( gr ) . assuming gr and taking a prior on the linear matter power spectrum at high redshift from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , anisotropic clustering of the cmass dr9 galaxies alone constrains @xmath0 and @xmath1 for @xmath2 , or @xmath3 for @xmath4 . when combined with the full cmb likelihood , the addition of the anisotropic clustering measurements to the spherically - averaged bao location increases the constraining power on dark energy by a factor of 4 in a flat cdm cosmology with constant dark energy equation of state @xmath5 ( giving @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this impressive gain depends on our measurement of both the growth of structure and alcock - paczynski effect , and is not realised when marginalising over the amplitude of redshift space distortions . combining with both the cmb and supernovae type ia ( sneia ) , we find @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath2 , or @xmath9 and @xmath10 assuming @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , when a @xmath11cdm background expansion is assumed , the combination of our estimate of the growth rate with previous growth measurements provides tight constraints on the parameters describing possible deviations from gr giving @xmath12 . for one parameter extensions of the flat @xmath11cdm model </S>",
    "<S> , we find a @xmath13 preference either for @xmath14 or slower growth than in gr . </S>",
