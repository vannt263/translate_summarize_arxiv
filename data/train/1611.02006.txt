    "there is increasing interest in two - species bose - einstein condensate ( tbec ) in last two decades since it was first studied theoretically by ho and shenoy@xcite , and was achieved experimentally by myatt , et al.@xcite .",
    "the tbec provides an important tool to clarify the inter - species and intra - species interactions . besides",
    ", molecules in well defined rovibrational levels with permanent electric - dipole moment can be thereby obtained , and they are valuable for studying the strongly interacting quantum gases.ospe06,webe08,ni08,bara08 . experimentally , the rb - cs mixture has been realized via a magnetic trap @xcite or an optical trap @xcite .",

    "there are a number of theoretical literatures dedicated to the tbec ho96,esry97,pu98,timm98,ao98,chui99,tripp00,ribo02,chui03,luo07,xu09,shi11,gau10,nott15 , scha15,inde15,roy15,luo08,polo15 .",

    "to clarify the effects of them is a main topic of study .",
    "this paper is dedicated to obtain the phase - diagrams . how the spatial configuration of the g.s .",
    "is affected by the parameters can be thereby visualized . for this purpose",
    ", effort is made to divide the whole parameter - space into zones , each supports a specific spatial configuration .",
    "based on the division , two types of phase - diagrams are plotted .",
    "related analysis is supported by analytical formalism .",
    "the emphasis is placed on the qualitative aspect .",
    "the particle numbers are considered to be large ( @xmath12 ) so that the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) can be applied .",
    "the symmetric states are obtained by solving the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( cgp ) in an analytical way . whereas the asymmetric states are obtained by introducing a model .",
    "both repulsive and attractive inter - species interactions are considered .",
    "two critical cases , namely , ( i ) the repulsive inter - species interaction matches the repulsive intra - species interaction and ( ii ) the attractive inter - species interaction nearly cancels the repulsive intra - species interaction , are taken into account .",
    "there are @xmath13 a - atoms with mass @xmath14  and interacting via @xmath15 , and @xmath16 b - atoms with @xmath17  and @xmath18 . the a- and b - atoms are interacting via @xmath19 .",
    "their spin - degrees of freedom are considered as being frozen .",
    "they are trapped by the isotropic parabolic potentials @xmath20 ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) . in the g.s . @xmath23",
    "the atoms of the same kind will have the same wave function @xmath24 which is most advantageous to binding .",
    "thus , @xmath25    it is well known that @xmath23 and the trap might not have the same symmetry .",
    "when the interspecies interaction is sufficiently repulsive , the two kinds of atoms might separate from each other in an asymmetric way .",
    "nonetheless , we consider first the case that the g.s .",
    "is symmetric .    in this case ,",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we introduce a mass @xmath28 and a frequency @xmath29 . @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "are used as units for energy and length in this paper .",
    "we further introduce @xmath32 and a set of parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "this set is called the weighted strengths ( w - strengths ) . under the tfa ,",
    "the cgp for @xmath37 and @xmath38 appear as @xmath39where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the inter - species interaction have the same sign ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) while @xmath44 and @xmath45  for the intra - species interaction are considered to be positive only .",
    "the chemical potential for the a - atoms ( b - atoms ) is equal to @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the normalization @xmath48 and @xmath49 are required . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are safely assumed .",
    "eqs.([eq5a],[eq5b ] ) demonstrate that the combined effects of the nine dynamical parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are sufficiently embodied by the four w - strengths .",
    "thus an approach based on the w - strengths would lead to a simplification .",
    "based on the w - strengths , we define    @xmath57    where @xmath58 . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are crucial in constituting the solutions of the cgp as shown below .",
    "it has been known that the spatial configuration of the symmetric g.s . has two phases .",
    "when each kind of atoms form a core surrounding the center , then it is named miscible phase denoted as ( a , b ) ( if the b - atoms have a broader distribution ) or ( b , a ) .",
    "when a kind of atoms form a core while the other kind form a shell away from the center , it is named immiscible phase denoted as [ a - b ] ( if the b - atoms form the shell ) or [ b - a ] .. more strictly , the miscible phase has both @xmath61 and @xmath62 being nonzero , while the immiscible phase has one of them being zero .",
    "the analytical solutions of the symmetric g.s . under the tfa have been worked out previously @xcite . nonetheless , in terms of the w - strengths , the analytical solutions could have a considerably simpler form .",
    "this simplification is valuable because it substantially benefits a more detailed analysis .",
    "thus , the simplified solutions are given in the appendix . besides , the division of the whole parameter - space into zones is a crucial point in our paper and is also included in the appendix . with the division ,",
    "various types of phase - diagrams can be plotted .",
    "based on the analytical solutions of the cgp and the division of the parameter - space which are given in the appendix , the first type of phase - diagrams are shown in fig.1 .",
    "let us define a critical value @xmath63 . in fig.1",
    "the lower and upper ends of the dash - dot curve have @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the two ends of the dash curve have @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , @xmath68 contains three critical values @xmath69 , 1 , and @xmath70 . in fig.1a ,",
    "when @xmath71 , the system collapses ( see below ) .",
    "when @xmath72 , the g.s .",
    "is in miscible phase .",
    "there is a competition between ( a , b ) and ( b , a ) phases depending on @xmath1 . when @xmath73  is sufficiently small so that @xmath74 , then the distribution of the a - atoms will be narrower and the g.s",
    ". will be in ( a , b ) ( refer to the appendix ) , or vice versa .",
    "thus , from the condition @xmath75 , we can define a critical ratio @xmath76    when @xmath77 @xmath78 , the g.s .",
    "is in ( a , b ) , or otherwise in ( b , a ) .",
    "when @xmath79 , the distributions of the a- and b - atoms overlap completely ( refer to the appendix ) .",
    "when @xmath80 , @xmath81 , thus the condition for the g.s . in ( a , b ) is @xmath82 ( in other words , the ( a",
    ", b ) phase would be more probable if @xmath83 is relatively weak and/or @xmath13 is small ) . when @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath86 increases further , the ( a , b ) phase disappears and the a - atoms begin to be distributed more outward .",
    "when @xmath87 , there is a competition between the [ b - a ] and ( b , a ) phases depending also on @xmath1 . when @xmath73  is sufficiently small to enable @xmath88 , the a - atoms will form a shell and the g.s .",
    "is in immiscible phase . otherwise , in miscible phase .",
    "when @xmath89 , the zone of [ b - a ] covers nearly the whole range of @xmath1 , and thus the immiscible phase becomes dominant .",
    "when @xmath90 , the lowest symmetric solutions of the cgp have the b - atoms being distributed more outward ( in [ a - b ] or ( a , b ) phases ) . nonetheless , when @xmath86  increases and crosses @xmath91 , a transition from [ b - a ] to [ a - b ] will occur . during this transition , the atoms in the shell and in the core interchange their roles ( i.e. , those in the core jump to the shell , and vice versa ) .",
    "this causes a remarkable increase in energy ( as shown below ) .",
    "accordingly , when @xmath92 , the symmetric configuration is no more stable .",
    "for this reason , we shall more concentrate on the case @xmath86 @xmath93 .    when @xmath94 , @xmath70 also @xmath95 , and the areas of the zones of [ b - a ] and [ a - b ] both become zero , and",
    "therefore the immiscible phase does not appear ( fig.1b belongs to this case ) .",
    "thus the difference between @xmath96 and @xmath97 is a basic requirement for the appearance of the immiscible phase .    for the case @xmath98",
    "( fig.1c belong to this case ) , a similar discussion can be performed where the a- and b - atoms interchange their roles .    to conclude , in most cases , the g.s .",
    "is in miscible phases .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath78 to judge either ( a , b ) or ( b , a ) would win . besides , there is a critical value @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath99 and when @xmath13  is so small that @xmath100 , the immiscible [ b - a ] phase will emerge in the zone lying between the curve @xmath101 and the vertical line @xmath66 ( where @xmath102 ) .",
    "note that the [ b - a ] phase requires thin this zone @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( refer to the appendix ) , it implies that the w - strengths should be appropriately given .",
    "the condition for [ a - b ] can be similarly deduced .",
    "thus the zones of the immiscible phase appear only by the two sides of the vertical line @xmath66 .",
    "the area of the zones depends on how far @xmath69 deviates from 1 .",
    "recall that @xmath69 contains the factor @xmath105 .",
    "thus the ratio of the two frequencies is a very sensitive factor to affect the spatial configuration ( say , a small reduction of @xmath106 will reduce @xmath107 , the zone of [ b - a ] shown in fig.1a will be thereby broader , and thus favors the a - atoms to form a shell ) .",
    "the spatial configurations , namely , the patterns of the wave functions have already been plotted in many literatures . to avoid tedious , only two particular cases are plotted here .",
    "\\(i ) for attractive @xmath2 with @xmath108    in this case both @xmath109 and @xmath60 are positive and tend to @xmath110 .",
    "let us assume @xmath111 .",
    "accordingly , the a - atoms have a narrower distribution .",
    "since the radius of the inner core @xmath112(refer to the appendix ) , it tends to zero . on the other hand , the outer border @xmath113^{1/5}$ ] .",
    "when @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "recall that @xmath116 is the limit of @xmath117 when @xmath114 .",
    "thus , if @xmath1 is so given that it would considerably smaller than the limit , then @xmath118 would be finite while @xmath119 . in this case",
    ", we will have a very dense core together with a thin tail extending outward formed by the b - atoms .",
    "alternatively , if the w - strengths are so given that @xmath120 , then the tail is formed by the a - atoms . whereas , when @xmath121 , the tail disappears and all the atoms stay inside a very small core .",
    "numerical calculations support this suggestion as shown in fig.2 , where the tail is long in 2a and 2b , but very short in 2c .",
    "the extremely high density at the center implies that the system tends to collapse .",
    "\\(ii ) for repulsive @xmath2 with @xmath122    when @xmath123 , the two species tend to separate completely from each other ( refer to the appendix ) .",
    "examples for the cases with @xmath124 are given in fig.3 characterized by having a shell attached to the outward border of a core .",
    "in fig.3 @xmath16 remains unchanged , while the increase of @xmath13  pushes the shell of the b - atoms more and more outward .",
    "when @xmath125 and @xmath126 have been known , the total energy of the system ( neglecting the kinetic energy ) is @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and so on .",
    "examples of @xmath131 ( where @xmath132 ) are plotted in fig.4 . where the five curves for symmetric states goes up with @xmath86 as expected . in all cases there is a notable jump when @xmath86 increases and crosses @xmath91 ( strictly , only the case that @xmath86 tends to @xmath133 can be calculated ) .",
    "this jump is associated with the transition from @xmath134 $ ] to @xmath135 $ ] mentioned above .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the increase of energy in the jump can be quite large .",
    "it implies that very high - lying collectively excited states might exist .",
    "all the horizontal lines are for asymmetric states , they are obtained via a model shown below .",
    "let @xmath136  and @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) be the axial coordinates , and two parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 are introduced .",
    "then , it is assumed that when @xmath141 @xmath142 and when @xmath143 @xmath144 in other words , we have proposed a model in which a ball with radius @xmath140 is divided into two sides separated by the plane @xmath145 .",
    "the a - atoms and b - atoms stay separately in the two sides .",
    "the orientation of the z - axis is irrelevant ( because the trap is isotropic ) . from the normalization",
    ", we have @xmath146 the two parameters @xmath140  and @xmath139 are determined by minimizing the total energy @xmath147 ( which is calculated via eq.([8 ] ) where the contribution from the kinetic energy has been neglected ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath131  are plotted in fig.4 and they appear as horizontal lines . in various cases , due to the jump appearing at @xmath148 ,",
    "the asymmetric states become lower in energy once @xmath149 ( i.e. , they become the g.s . ) .",
    "this is clearly shown in the figure .",
    "recalled that the kinetic energy has been neglected . when the particle number is huge , the ratio of the kinetic energy over the total energy is small ( say , in an estimation given in @xcite , the ratio is 6% when @xmath150 ) .",
    "thus the neglect will not spoil the qualitative results .",
    "the second type of phase - diagrams are given in fig.5 .",
    "the physics extracted from fig.5 and from fig.1 are similar . therefore , we just mention a few points : ( i ) the zones for the immiscible phase appear only in the neighborhood of the horizontal line at which @xmath148 .",
    "( ii ) for all the cases with @xmath122 , the immiscible and miscible phases are competing .",
    "when @xmath151  is much stronger than @xmath83 , the b - atoms will form a shell and the g.s .",
    "is in the [ a - b ] phase .. when @xmath152  is not so strong , the b - atoms will be closer to the core and the [ a - b ] becomes ( a , b ) .",
    "when @xmath151  reduces further , the b - atoms will have a narrower distribution while the a - toms will be distributed more outward , and the ( a , b ) .",
    "becomes ( b , a ) . when @xmath151 becomes very weak , the a - atoms will form a shell and the ( b , a ) .",
    "becomes [ b - a ] .",
    "( iii ) when @xmath86 decreases further from @xmath91 , immiscible phase disappears .",
    "\\(i ) due to the introduction of the w - strengths , analytical solutions of the cgp can be expressed in a considerably simpler form to facilitate related analysis .",
    "\\(ii ) a model for the asymmetric g.s . has been proposed .",
    "the competition between the symmetric and asymmetric states has been evaluated .",
    "a big gap in energy was found during the [ a - b ] to [ b - a ] ( or reversely ) transition which takes place when @xmath86 crosses @xmath91 . due to the gap",
    ", the asymmetric states become the g.s . once @xmath149 .",
    "it has been known that , in the low - density region , the overlap of the two wave functions will be remarkably underestimated under the tfa . thus the energy @xmath153 will be therefore underestimated .",
    "this would affect the evaluation of the gap .",
    "however , the gap appears only when a kind of atoms tend to leave completely from the other kind . in this case , the percent of @xmath153 in the total energy is extremely small .",
    "thus , the existence of the gap , which is the difference of the two total energies , will not be spoiled by using the tfa .",
    "\\(iii ) the whole parameter - space has been divided into zones each supports a specific spatial configuration .",
    "based on the division two types of phase - diagrams have been plotted . making use of the phase - diagrams where the boundaries have analytical forms , the effects of various parameters",
    "can be clarified not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "\\(iv ) additional effort is made to study the feature of the g.s .",
    "when @xmath154 and @xmath108 . in the former case the shell tends to separate from the core completely ,",
    "while in the latter the system tends to collapse .",
    "\\(v ) we have found a critical point @xmath69 which is also useful in application .",
    "one can tune @xmath13 and/or @xmath106 to make @xmath69 tends to @xmath65 to prohibit the formation of a shell ( i.e.,the shell can not be formed even if @xmath86 is sufficiently strong ) , or to make @xmath69 differs remarkably from @xmath65 to facilitate the formation of a shell ( i.e.,the shell can be formed even if @xmath86 is rather weak ) .",
    "the point @xmath69 is associated with the case that a kind of atoms tend to leave completely from the center . in this case",
    "tfa is still applicable in the qualitative sense ( comparing fig.1b and 1c of @xcite , where 1b is closer to the above case ) .",
    "\\(vi ) we have found another critical point @xmath78 which marks the complete overlap of @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "this finding has potential usage . in experiments",
    ", one can tune the tunable parameters ( say , the trap frequency and/or the strengths ) so that the two density profiles overlap .",
    "then , once all the other parameter are known , @xmath1 can be directly known from eq.([7 ] ) .",
    "since the particle numbers are in general difficult to determine precisely , this approach provides an auxiliary way helpful for determining the numbers .",
    "it was found that in the case that both @xmath155 and @xmath156 are nonzero at @xmath157 and close to each other , the tfa wave functions deviate very slightly from those beyond the tfa ( comparing fig.1a and 1b of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , eq.([7 ] ) is reliable because it is just associated with this case .",

    "where @xmath109 and @xmath60 are defined in eq.([6 ] ) depending on the w - strengths directly , @xmath161^{2/5 } \\\\",
    "x_{2 } & = & ( \\varepsilon _ { 2}-\\beta _ { 2}x_{1})/\\alpha _ { 2 }   \\label{eq16}\\end{aligned}\\]]furthermore , when @xmath162 and @xmath163 are known , @xmath164 is related to them as @xmath165 .      when @xmath168 , both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are zero .",
    "thus @xmath169 and @xmath170 mark the outward borders of the a - atoms and b - atoms , respectively .",
    "one can check directly that the above @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfy the cgp , they are normalized , and they are continuous at the common border of the domains ( however their derivatives are not ) .    obviously , the above solution would be physically meaningful only if the w - strengths are so preset that @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "the latter can be satisfied when @xmath174 is preset .",
    "besides , in order to have both @xmath155 and @xmath156 being @xmath175 at @xmath157 , @xmath176 ( or @xmath177 , equivalently @xmath178^{2/5}\\geq 2\\beta _ { 2}y_{1}$ ] ) is required . due to this constraint , the phase ( a , b ) could emerge only in a specific zone inside the whole parameter - space .",
    "this zone is bound by the surfaces @xmath179 and @xmath180 . inside this zone @xmath171 , @xmath174 , and @xmath181  hold .",
    "referred to fig.1 and 5 .    for attractive",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath181 holds always .",
    "thus the border @xmath180 does not appear .",
    "accordingly , the zone for ( a , b ) is bound by the surfaces @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( where @xmath184 ) .",
    "however , when @xmath114 or @xmath185 , both @xmath109 and @xmath60 tend to @xmath186 . hence , @xmath169 becomes extremely small and the system is highly dense at the center .",
    "this will lead to a collapse . due to the collapse , the case @xmath187 is not considered .    for ( b , a )",
    ", the solution can be similarly obtained from the above formulae by an interchange of @xmath37 and @xmath38 together with an interchange of the indexes 1 and 2 .",
    "thus , associated with the zone for ( a , b ) , there is a partner - zone for ( b , a ) , where the a- and b - atoms interchange their role .",
    "since @xmath204 and @xmath205 should be positive in the second domain , @xmath171 and @xmath206 are both necessary .",
    "in particular , the latter condition @xmath206 assures the emergence of the shell formed by the b - atoms ( because a negative @xmath60  assures that @xmath156  increases with @xmath158as shown in eq.([eq24 ] ) ) . note that , for attractive @xmath2 , we know from the definitions of @xmath109 and @xmath60 that they must have the same sign .",
    "thus the immiscible phase does not exist when the interspecies interaction is attractive ( refer to fig.1 and 5 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 is considered as positive in the follows .",
    "obviously , @xmath207 is further required to assure that the solution is meaningful .",
    "when @xmath208  and with the preset @xmath171 and @xmath206 the condition @xmath209 can be satisfied if @xmath210 .",
    "besides , from eqs.([eq19],[eq20 ] ) we have        then , @xmath216 .",
    "thus , when @xmath60  is negative and @xmath217 holds , the condition @xmath218 is satisfied . to conclude , if we can find out a @xmath193 satisfies eq.([eq21 ] ) and is lying in the range  @xmath219 , then the @xmath37 and @xmath38  given above is a physically meaningful solution . by solving eq.([eq21 ] ) numerically , a unique @xmath193  ranging inside the above range      let us find out the zone in the parameter - space that supports the @xmath134 $ ] solution . when @xmath220 , we have @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223",
    ".  thus the wave functions of the @xmath134 $ ] and those of ( a , b ) with @xmath180 overlap .",
    "recall that @xmath180  is a border of ( a , b ) .",
    "thus the zone of @xmath134 $ ] is adjacent to the zone of ( a , b ) , and they have the common border @xmath180 .    when @xmath123 ( or @xmath224 ) , we know from eq.([eq27 ] ) that @xmath225 , thus the shell tends to separate from the core completely .",
    "examples are shown in fig.3 .",
    "since @xmath226 is not allowed , @xmath227 should be the other border .",
    "note that , when @xmath227 , the cgp has no physical solution .",
    "thus , a complete separation between the shell and the core is not allowed .",
    "to conclude , the zone of @xmath134 $ ] requires @xmath171 and @xmath206 and is bound by the borders @xmath180 and @xmath227 .    the case with @xmath228",
