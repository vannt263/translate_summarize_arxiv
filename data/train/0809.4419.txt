    "<S> we consider a strongly interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) bose - fermi mixture confined in a harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas ( 1d bose gas with repulsive hard - core interactions ) and of a non - interacting fermi gas ( 1d spin - aligned fermi gas ) , both species interacting through hard - core repulsive interactions . using a generalized bose - fermi mapping , we determine the one - body density matrices , exact particle density profiles , momentum distributions and behaviour of the mixture under 1d expansion when opening the trap . in real space , </S>",
    "<S> bosons and fermions do not display any phase separation : the respective density profiles extend over the same region and they both present a number of peaks equal to the total number of particles in the trap . in momentum space </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic component has the typical narrow tg profile , while the fermionic component shows a broad distribution with fermionic oscillations at small momenta . due to the large boson - fermion repulsive interactions , both the bosonic and the fermionic momentum distributions decay as @xmath0 at large momenta , like in the case of a pure bosonic tg gas . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath1 is related to the two - body density matrix and to the bosonic concentration in the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> when opening the trap , both momentum distributions `` fermionize '' under expansion and turn into that of a fermi gas with a particle number equal to the total number of particles in the mixture . </S>"
