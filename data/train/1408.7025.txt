    "evidence synthesis [ e.g. , spiegelhalter , abrams andmyles ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] has become an important method in epidemiology , where multiple , disparate , incomplete and often biased sources of observational ( e.g. , surveillance or survey ) data are available to inform estimation of relevant quantities , such as prevalence and incidence of infectious disease [ @xcite ] .",
    "data may directly inform a quantity of interest , @xmath0 , or , more usually , may indirectly inform multiple parameters @xmath1 by directly informing some function of @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "such a function may represent , for example , the relationship between a biased source of data and the parameter the data should theoretically measure , so that the bias is explicitly modelled .",
    "evidence synthesis methods combine these heterogeneous types of challenging data in a coherent manner , to estimate the `` basic '' parameters @xmath2 and from these obtain simultaneously the `` functional '' parameters @xmath4 .",
    "these functional parameters include both those directly observed and others that may not be observed but are of interest to estimate .",
    "this type of estimation typically necessitates the formulation of complex probabilistic models , often in a bayesian framework .",
    "knowledge of the severity of an influenza outbreak is crucial for informing and monitoring appropriate public health responses .",
    "severity estimates are necessary not only during a pandemic to inform immediate public health responses , but also afterwards , when a robust reconstruction of what happened during the pandemic is required to evaluate the responses . moreover , as has happened in past influenza pandemics [ @xcite ] , if a pandemic strain continues to circulate for some years , with unusual patterns of age - specific mortality , then severity estimates over time , both in terms of attack rates ( the proportion of the population infected ) and case - severity risks ( the probability an infection leads to a severe event ) , are required to understand if the strain is likely to continue circulating and if severity is changing over time .",
    "however , severity is an example epidemic characteristic that is difficult to measure directly .",
    "typically , severity is expressed as the probability that an infection will result in a severe event , for example , death .",
    "we refer to this probability as the `` case - fatality risk '' ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "severity may also be quantified by `` case - hospitalisation '' ( @xmath6 ) and `` case - intensive care admission '' ( @xmath7 ) risks , defined similarly as probabilities that an infection results in hospitalisation or intensive care ( icu ) admission .",
    "not all influenza infections will be symptomatic , where `` symptomatic '' may be defined in different ways , but is here taken to denote febrile influenza - like illness ( ili ) .",
    "not all infections will therefore result in symptoms severe enough for a patient to access health care and hence be detectable in surveillance systems [ @xcite ] .",
    "symptomatic case - severity risks ( @xmath8 ) , the probabilities a symptomatic infection leads to severe events , are therefore also considered as important indicators of severity for influenza .",
    "estimation of these probabilities requires information on both the cumulative incidence of ( symptomatic ) infection over a period of time of interest ( the denominator ) and the cumulative incidence of severe events ( the numerator ) .",
    "however , the denominator , whether symptomatic or all infection , is challenging to determine , due to the unobserved infections .",
    "population - wide serological testing ( testing for antibodies to influenza infection in blood serum samples ) to measure the proportion of the population infected is one possibility , but is unlikely to be feasible .",
    "this challenge is only compounded in a pandemic situation , where resources and time are even more stretched than usual [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "the most feasible approach to the assessment of severity is therefore via estimation , combining data from different sources and accounting for their biases , due , for example , to under - ascertainment .",
    "the majority of methods adopted to estimate influenza case - severity [ e.g. , @xcite ] have not systematically accounted for all biases .",
    "crucially , they have not made use of all available information in the estimation process , nor have they accounted for all uncertainty inherent in the data .",
    "bayesian evidence synthesis provides a flexible framework in which all available relevant data may be coherently amalgamated , together with prior information on biases , to estimate case - severity [ @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] .    until the 2012/2013 winter",
    ", england experienced three waves of infection with the 2009 pandemic a / h1n1 influenza strain : in the summer of 2009 , the autumn and winter of 20092010 , and the autumn and winter of 20102011 .",
    "the severity of the first two waves , as measured by case - severity risks , was previously estimated [ @xcite ] by synthesising data either from surveillance systems in place to monitor seasonal influenza or from systems set up specifically in response to the pandemic [ @xcite ] . in this paper , we present in the statistical model used in @xcite and extend the approach to estimating severity in the third wave of infection .",
    "after the first two waves , the world health organization declared a move to a post - pandemic period ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2010/h1n1_vpc_20100810/en/index.html ) , at which time many of thesurveillance systems that operated during the pandemic situation were either stopped or changed in form .",
    "we describe how the model of @xcite is further developed to account for these changes in the available data .",
    "the evidence used to estimate severity in the first two waves and the changes to the surveillance systems between waves are described in section  [ sec_data ] .",
    "a bayesian approach to evidence synthesis is introduced in section  [ sec_methods ] .",
    "we then describe in section  [ sec_model ] a generic model for estimating severity , before showing in section  [ sec_model12 ] how the model was implemented in the first two waves .",
    "we next develop the model to estimate severity in the third wave , presenting two approaches ( sections  [ sec_3wsep ] and  [ sec_3wsim ] , resp . ) .",
    "results are given in section  [ sec_results ] and we end with a discussion in section  [ sec_discuss ] .",
    "during the first two pandemic waves in 20092010 , data were available from various surveillance systems at or used by the uk s health protection agency ( hpa , now public health england ) that provided evidence on some aspect of the pandemic , at various levels of severity .",
    "these sources indirectly informed the case - severity risks and full details of each are given in section  1.1 of the supplementary material [ @xcite ] .",
    "briefly , they included the following :    data on laboratory - confirmed pandemic a / h1n1 cases [ i.e. , cases where infection with the pandemic strain was confirmed virologically , via real - time polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) testing of nasal or throat swabs ] in the first few weeks of the pandemic [ health protection agency , health protection scotland , communicable disease surveillance centrenorthern ireland and national public health service for wales ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] . the data included dates of illness onset and information on hospital admission",
    "if it occurred , from which age group - specific case - hospitalisation risks amongst confirmed cases could be estimated .",
    "note that these confirmed - case - hospitalisation risks are likely to be higher than the case - hospitalisation risks in all symptomatic cases , since not all symptomatic cases will have been confirmed in the first few weeks , and more severe cases in hospital are more likely to have been detected than less severe cases ;    estimates of the number of symptomatic cases by week , age and region , produced by the hpa .",
    "these estimates were recognised to be under - estimates , given the data of point ( iii ) ;    serial data on age group - specific proportions of individuals with antibodies to the pandemic strain of influenza ( `` sero - prevalence '' ) , from repeated cross - sectional surveys of residual sera from other ( unrelated ) diagnostic testing [ @xcite ] .",
    "these data indirectly inform the cumulative incidence of infection , that is , the proportion of the population infected over a period of time .",
    "initially these data were taken at face value , but concerns about potential sampling biases led to extra sensitivity analyses ( see section  [ sec_sens12 ] ) ;    data on laboratory - confirmed cases in hospital [ campbell et  al.(@xcite ) ] , including age group and dates of illness onset , hospital admission and icu admission ; and    data on the number of deaths amongst persons with confirmed pandemic a / h1n1 influenza and/or mention of influenza on the death certificate , reported to the hpa and/or the chief medical officer [ @xcite ] .      during the third wave ,",
    "data sources ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iv ) were no longer available in the same form .",
    "although results from testing of samples from before and after the third wave from data source ( iii ) are now available [ @xcite ] , at the time of the analyses presented here , they were not accessible .",
    "full details of each source below are given in section  1.2 of the supplementary material [ @xcite ] .",
    "between the second and third waves , the surveillance system for hospital admissions of confirmed cases moved to being a sentinel surveillance system , the uk severe influenza surveillance scheme ( usiss ) .",
    "the data from this system are available at a coarser level of age aggregation and come from a sentinel sample of 23 acute nhs hospital trusts in the 20102011 season , as opposed to the 129 trusts participating in hospital surveillance during the first two waves .",
    "additional data are available on patients present in all icus in england with _ suspected _ pandemic a / h1n1 influenza , again at a coarser age aggregation , from the department of health [ dh ; @xcite ] .",
    "we also have data on virological positivity ( proportion testing positive for the pandemic strain ) from a sentinel system , `` datamart , '' comprising results of rt - pcr testing from 16 hpa and nhs laboratories in england , covering mainly patients hospitalised with respiratory illness .    in the third wave ,",
    "the hpa estimates of source ( ii ) were not available , due to the underlying data being specified at a different level of disaggregation .",
    "instead , we use estimates of the number symptomatic ( details in section  3.1 of the supplementary material [ @xcite ] ) obtained from an alternative general practice sentinel surveillance system [ @xcite ] .      estimating case - severity by dividing the observed number of infections at a severe level over a period of time by the observed ( i.e. , confirmed ) number of infections in the same period is highly likely to result in biased estimates .",
    "this bias is due to both under - ascertainment of infections in surveillance systems and differential probabilities of observation by severity of infection [ @xcite ] .",
    "any estimation therefore has to account for these probabilities of observing infections ( `` detection probabilities '' ) .",
    "further challenges are posed by the following : uncertainty about the representativeness of the surveillance data for the general population ( sampling biases ) ; the different degrees of aggregation in each data source ; the fact that some of the data sources , such as the sero - prevalence data , only inform _ indirectly _ the number of infections ; and the changes in surveillance systems over time .",
    "a synthesis of all the above data sources to estimate case - severity therefore requires these challenges to be addressed .",
    "evidence synthesis [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] denotes the idea of estimating a set of @xmath9 `` basic '' parameters @xmath10 from a collection of @xmath11 independent data sources @xmath12 , arising from multiple studies , perhaps of differing design .",
    "each source @xmath13 provides evidence on a `` functional '' parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 may either be equality to a single specific element @xmath16 of @xmath2 , so that the data _ directly _ informs @xmath16 , or a function of one or more components of @xmath2 , so that the data _ indirectly _ inform multiple basic parameters .",
    "the collection @xmath17 is therefore a mixture of basic and functional parameters .",
    "the aim is to estimate the set of basic parameters @xmath2 , from which the functional parameters @xmath18 , as well as any other functions @xmath19 of @xmath2 that are of interest , may be simultaneously derived .",
    "denote the total set of functions by @xmath20 .",
    "inference may be carried out either in a classical setting , maximising the likelihood @xmath21 , or , as in this paper , in a bayesian setting , assigning a prior distribution to the basic parameters , @xmath22 , and obtaining the posterior distribution @xmath23 typically via a simulation - based algorithm such as markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) .",
    "the posterior distribution of any of the functional parameters may also be derived .",
    "a bayesian evidence synthesis meets the challenges of case - severity estimation by allowing the relationship between data and parameters to be accurately formulated , for example , through the use of bias parameters such as detection probabilities ; prior information on such biases to be easily introduced ; and a natural framework in which to assess the consistency of evidence [ @xcite ] , as part of the inference and model criticism cycle advocated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the following generic synthesis of evidence to estimate severity was the basis of the estimation of severity of the 2009 pandemic a / h1n1 strain of influenza [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ] , both in the usa and in england during the first two waves .    assume the population of interest is divided into 7 age groups : @xmath24 , 14 , 514 , 1524 , 2544 , 4564 , 65@xmath25 , indexed by @xmath26 .",
    "denote the age - specific population sizes by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 indexes waves of infection ( @xmath29 in the case of england ) .",
    "consider infections at five increasing severity levels : all infections ( @xmath30 ) , symptomatic infections ( @xmath31 ) , hospitalisations ( @xmath32 ) , icu admissions ( @xmath33 ) and deaths ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "for each wave and age - group , consider each of these sets of infections to be subsets of the set of infections at a less severe level , such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that we assume the set of deaths is a subset of the set of hospitalisations , but that not all deaths are a subset of the set of icu admissions .",
    "the set of infections @xmath30 is clearly a subset of the population . for each age group @xmath37 , denote the cumulative number of new infections during wave @xmath28 at severity level @xmath38 ( i.e. , the size of subset @xmath38 ) by @xmath39 .",
    "denote by @xmath40 the age- and wave - specific conditional probability that a case is at severity level @xmath38 given the case has already reached a less severe level @xmath41 , that is , @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",

    "the conditional probabilities @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are basic parameters to which we assign prior distributions and the @xmath39 are functional parameters .",
    "note that in the us analysis [ @xcite ] , the @xmath39 were considered stochastic nodes , realisations of a binomial distribution with probability parameter @xmath40 and an appropriate denominator @xmath51 .",
    "however , in the uk analysis [ @xcite ] and the analyses reported below , convergence of the mcmc algorithm was only achieved when the corresponding deterministic ( mean ) assumption was made for the @xmath39 , for reasons that are discussed further in section  [ sec_discuss ] .",
    "the subsetting assumptions allow the case - hospitalisation , case - icu admission and case - fatality risks to be defined as functional parameters expressed as products of component conditional probabilities : @xmath52 similarly , the symptomatic case - icu admission and symptomatic case - fatality risks are defined as @xmath53 the conditional probability @xmath54 is commonly referred to as the `` infection attack rate '' ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 is known as the `` symptomatic attack rate , '' @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 denote `` detection '' probabilities , that is , probabilities that infections at severity level @xmath38 are observed .",

    "in general , at each severity level @xmath38 , we observe @xmath63 infections out of the @xmath39 total infections .",
    "each @xmath63 is assumed to be binomially distributed with size parameter @xmath39 and detection probability @xmath58 : @xmath64 the likelihood would then be @xmath65    the specific models , for example , as in sections  [ sec_model12 ] and [ sec_3wsep ] , may have variations on this likelihood , depending on the data available .",
    "for example , data may be directly available on the number of hospitalisations resulting in icu admission , in which case these data may contribute to the likelihood in the following form : @xmath66      once the priors and likelihood are defined , samples are obtained from the resulting joint posterior distribution by mcmc simulation , using openbugs [ @xcite ] . in each model described below , three independent chains were run for 2,000,000 iterations each , with the first 500,000 iterations discarded as a burn - in period and the remainder thinned to every @xmath67th iteration , resulting in 450,000 samples on which to base posterior inference .",
    "convergence was established by both visual inspection of the trace plots and examination of the brooks ",
    "gelman  rubin diagnostic plots [ @xcite ] .",
    "the model used in @xcite for the first two waves of infection in england is described in the next section .",
    "two alternative methods of modelling the third wave of infection are then given : ( a )  a  two - stage approach where posterior distributions from the second wave model are used to inform prior distributions for some of the conditional probabilities in the third wave ; and ( b ) a one - stage approach where all three waves are modelled simultaneously , with the third wave conditional probabilities parameterised in terms of the corresponding second wave probabilities .",

    "three possible hypotheses are as follows : ( a ) that the increase is due to the age shift in the infection attack rate away from school - age children toward adults across waves ; ( b ) that the lack of third wave data and consequent parameterisation of some of the third wave conditional probabilities in terms of the corresponding second wave probabilities [ equation  ( [ eqn_3wparam ] ) ] results in the attenuated change in severity from the second to third wave ; and/or ( c ) that unaccounted differences in the representativeness of the different surveillance systems used in the third wave compared to the first two may have an effect on the estimated severity .",
    "these possibilities are not mutually exclusive and the extent to which the estimated severity is reliant on each is unknown .      the potential for unaccounted biases in the sero - prevalence data ( sections  [ sec_data ] and [ sec_lik12 ] ) , as well as the belief that the hpa case estimates represented underestimates , prompted several sensitivity analyses to further assess the uncertainty in the infection attack rates in the first two waves .",
    "sensitivity to the choice of data informing the denominators ( the infection attack rate @xmath55 or the number of symptomatic infections @xmath74 ) and to the prior distribution of @xmath55 was assessed .",
    "specifically , four models with different data informing @xmath55 and @xmath74 were considered :    using the hpa case estimates to inform @xmath74 , assuming they do so unbiasedly in the first two waves ( i.e. , with @xmath202 ) , and using no sero - prevalence data ;    the model presented here and in @xcite , assuming the hpa case estimates are biased downwards and using only the baseline and post - first wave sero - prevalence data ;    as in model 2 , but using all the sero - prevalence data ( up to post - second wave ) of table  5 of section  1.1.3 of the supplementary material [ @xcite ] , assuming the hpa case estimates are biased downwards in both waves ; and    as in model 3 , but assuming the sero - prevalence data are biased upwards and the hpa case estimates are biased downwards .    analyses using models 1 and 2 were then repeated using three different prior distributions for the infection attack rate :    @xmath203 , allowing the total attack rate over the two waves to be a priori @xmath204 on average , with @xmath111 prior mass in the interval ( 0.10.7 ) , and with a @xmath205 ratio between the two waves ;    @xmath206 , allowing again a prior total attack rate of 0.4 ( 0.10.7 ) , but with a @xmath207 ratio between waves ;    @xmath208 , allowing a prior total attack rate of 0.4 ( 0.10.7 ) , with a @xmath209 ratio between waves .",
    "the choice of informative priors is motivated by the total attack rates in prior pandemics , with the prior uncertainty still relatively large .",
    "@xcite found susceptible attack rates ( i.e. , proportion of susceptibles infected , as opposed to proportion of the total population ) of between @xmath210 and @xmath211 in the first wave of the 19681969 pandemic , compared to between @xmath212 and @xmath213 in the second , which motivates prior ( b ) .",
    "this prior may in fact be sceptical for the 2009 pandemic , as instead of a @xmath214 ratio between waves , the hpa case estimates and the severe data suggest the ratio was at least @xmath205 , if not @xmath209 or greater . however , this ratio may vary by both age and region , with london in particular experiencing a somewhat different epidemic to the rest of the country [ @xcite ] . prior ( c )",
    "therefore allows for the converse , with a greater second wave than first .",
    "the sensitivity analyses to the choice of prior distribution of the infection attack rate in the first two waves suggest the key messages from @xcite are robust to the choice of prior distribution .",
    "results were less robust to the choice of denominator data included in the model .",
    "the inclusion of the post - second wave sero - prevalence data suggested a higher infection attack rate [ 28.4%(26.030.8% ) ] than the baseline analysis [ 11.2%  ( 7.418.9% ) ] , with a corresponding lower case - fatality risk in the second wave [ 0.0027%  ( 0.00240.0031% ) compared to 0.009%  ( 0.0040.014% ) ] .",
    "full details of these sensitivity analyses are given in section  5 of the supplementary material [ @xcite ] .",
    "recall ( section  [ sec_lik12 ] ) that the samples tested post - second wave and before and after the third wave [ @xcite ] may overrepresent individuals at higher risk of infection and vaccination .",
    "the observed sero - prevalence in these samples may therefore suggest a higher infection attack rate than truly occurred .",
    "further work to obtain background information on individuals in the samples , and therefore to account for sampling biases , is underway , prompted in part by the results of these sensitivity analyses .    in the third wave , a sensitivity analysis to the set of virological positivity data used",
    "was performed ( sections  1.2.1 and 3.1 of the supplementary material [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the main analysis used the full positivity data , with the results of the bayesian joint regression model of the positivity and primary care consultation data ( table  13 of the supplementary material ) incorporated into the combined 3-wave model as shown in figure  [ fig_sev3 ] and section  3.1 of the supplementary material .",
    "the sensitivity analysis employed instead a set of virological positivity data restricted to tests made on swabs that were collected within 5 days of an ili consultation , with corresponding results from the joint regression model in table  14 of the supplementary material .",
    "the results from including the two alternative sets of estimates from the joint regression model into the combined 3-wave model are compared in figures  [ fig_csrs_sens ] and [ fig_iar_sens ] .     and @xmath5 from the combined model , by age and source of positivity data .",
    "note the different scales on the @xmath110-axes . ]",
    "the general conclusions about the age distribution of the case - severity risks and infection attack rate in the third wave are unchanged by the use of the restricted positivity data .",
    "the restricted data do imply a slightly higher and more uncertain attack rate in each age group ( figure  [ fig_iar_sens ] ) , due to the higher observed positivity and smaller sample sizes .",
    "correspondingly , the case - severity risks are slightly lower in each age group in the sensitivity analysis ( figure  [ fig_csrs_sens ] ) , but the greater uncertainty in the denominator does not seem to translate directly into greater uncertainty in the risks .",
    "we have extended and further developed a bayesian evidence synthesis model [ @xcite ] to characterise and estimate the severity of the 2009 pandemic a / h1n1 strain of influenza in the three waves of infection experienced in england .",
    "the model has been adapted to account for changes in the surveillance data available over the course of the three waves , considering two approaches : ( a ) a two - stage approach , using posterior distributions from the model for the first two waves to inform prior distributions for the third wave analysis ; and ( b ) modelling all three waves simultaneously , accounting for the reduction in available data by parameterising the third wave severity parameters in terms of the corresponding second wave parameters .",
    "both approaches have resulted in broadly the same three key conclusions :    the age distribution in case - severity risks is `` u''-shaped , implying children aged less than a year and older adults have highest severity , although their estimates are also the most uncertain .",
    "this pattern is consistent with the increasing severity with age seen in other countries during the 2009 pandemic [ @xcite ] , where in each of these analyses , the authors did not distinguish between children under 1 year of age and those aged 14 .",
    "the pattern is also consistent with global relative risks by age of severe events compared to the general population estimated by @xcite .",
    "the age distribution of the infection attack rate changes over waves , with school - age children most affected in the first two waves and an increase in the attack rate in adults aged 25 and older from the second to third waves .    when averaged over all ages , severity in those infected appears to increase over the three waves .",
    "the changing age distribution and apparent increase in severity over waves is consistent with estimates from the two pandemic waves experienced by other countries [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is important to note that the estimates presented here do not account for risk factors for severe influenza , nor for vaccination status nor for other preventive measures , such as social distancing , which might have an effect on severity .",
    "both the joint regression model of virological positivity and gp consultation and the full severity model would require further development to account for these factors and to be able to use the second and third wave serology data accounting for sampling biases .",
    "assessment of the effect on estimates of assumptions  such as that of no influenza - related deaths occurring outside of hospital or the parameterisation of the third wave in terms of the second wave in the combined analysis ",
    "is also key .",
    "the possible effect of any differences in representativeness of the various surveillance systems in the third compared to the first two waves is an issue for further investigation .",
    "the sample sizes and prior distributions chosen do not provide enough information to enable convergence of the mcmc algorithm for the severity model when taking the number of infections @xmath39 to be a binomial realisation from the number at a less severe level @xmath41 .",
    "this lack of convergence implies there may be too much uncertainty to allow identifiability of the model in this case , prompting instead the mean assumption @xmath69 .",
    "another area for future investigation is to assess how informative the priors are required to be or how large sample sizes need to be to enable convergence when the @xmath51 are stochastic .    despite these challenges ,",
    "our bayesian evidence synthesis approach has allowed us to draw important public health conclusions , not only in characterising the severity of the 2009 pandemic , but also in shaping future research .",
    "the sensitivity analyses showed the severity estimates were robust to prior assumptions about the infection attack rate , but less robust to the choice of data to include in informing the attack rate .",
    "although the magnitude of the severity estimates varied , the conclusions of a `` u''-shaped age distribution to severity and an apparent increase in severity over waves were nevertheless robust .",
    "the sensitivity of the results has , furthermore , contributed to the initiation of a project to obtain further data to better understand the potential sampling bias in the sero - prevalence data [ @xcite ] .",
    "the evidence synthesis framework has also given us the flexibility to account for biases , using prior information on parameters representing the biases , for example .",
    "bias modelling has been an integral part of the model development , inference and criticism cycle , as have the sensitivity analyses .",
    "it is important , in any analysis , to understand the contribution of each item of evidence , whether in the form of model structure , prior distribution or data , in driving inferences .",
    "it is particularly crucial when an analysis relies on informative priors for identifiability , as is the case here .",
    "another key aspect of model criticism in an evidence synthesis is to assess the consistency of the various data sources , not only with each other , but also with the model structure .",
    "it is possible , and indeed common , in syntheses of multiple sources of evidence to find both that some parameters are only barely identified by the data and that other parameters are informed indirectly by more than one data item . in the latter case , there is clearly potential for different sources of data to conflict , providing inconsistent evidence on a particular parameter [ @xcite ] .",
    "such conflicts need to be detected , measured , understood and resolved .",
    "conflict diagnostics , in the form of cross - validatory posterior prediction , for the first wave confirm the inconsistency between the serology data and the hpa estimates of the number symptomatic if taken at face value [ @xcite ] . in our main analysis , we addressed the conflict by incorporating a bias parameter for the hpa estimates , whereas in the sensitivity analyses , we also considered a bias parameter for the serology data .",
    "further preliminary work on measuring conflict seems to confirm the suggestion of the sensitivity analyses that the severe end data does indeed conflict with the evidence on the attack rates .",
    "given the uncertainties in the attack rates , understanding and resolving this conflict is an important next step .",
    "the iterative process of fitting , criticising and further developing an evidence synthesis model to address conflicts , as we have done and are continuing to do here , leads automatically to internal consistency .",
    "by contrast , external validation is much more challenging in an evidence synthesis framework . as already noted , due to identifiability issues common to evidence syntheses , it is rare to find external data against which to validate ",
    "such data are instead used in the synthesis .    despite these challenges , an evidence synthesis using a complex probabilistic model",
    "provides a powerful approach to estimating influenza severity when the available evidence comes from multiple sources that are incomplete and biased .",
    "the embedding of a `` pyramid '' approach to severity estimation within an evidence synthesis framework , as presented here , is easily adapted to other contexts , both within epidemiology , where many diseases may be observed at different levels of severity or diagnosis , and in other fields where observation occurs at different levels , for example , quality control or ecology .",
