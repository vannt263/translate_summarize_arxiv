    "the calculation is based on some hypotheses on the typical structure of @xmath61 , a pivotal role being played by the notion of _ pure state_. since this concept is only intuitively defined in the physics literature , we propose here two mathematically precise definitions . in both cases a pure state is a ( sequence of ) probability measures @xmath62 on @xmath63 .",

    "these two definitions mimic the well - known ones on @xmath80 in terms of tail triviality and extremality  @xcite .",
    "further , the second one is clearly related to the behavior of local monte carlo markov chain dynamics .",
    "a small conductance amounts to a bottleneck in the distribution and hence to a large relaxation time . while we expect them to be equivalent for a large family of models , proving this is a largely open problem .",
    "moreover we should emphasize that the heuristic cavity method followed in this paper never explicitly uses either of these definitions .",
    "the hypotheses implicit in the cavity method can be expressed in terms of the _ pure states decomposition _ of @xmath61 .",

    "statistical physics calculations suggest that a wide class of mean field models is described by one of the following ` universal behaviors ' .",

    "the reader will notice that this list does not include full replica symmetry breaking phases , in which pure states are organized according to an ultrametric structure . while this behavior is as generic as the previous ones , our understanding of it in sparse graph models is still rather poor .",

    "( [ eq : factor ] ) indexed by a continuous parameter @xmath12 ( such as the clause density in @xmath0-sat ) . in this setting , the above behaviors often appear in sequence as listed above when the system becomes more and more constrained ( e.g.   as @xmath12 is increased in @xmath0-sat ) .",
    "the different regimes are then separated by phase transitions : the ` dynamical ' or ` clustering ' phase transition from rs to d1rsb ( at @xmath91 ) and the ` condensation ' phase transition between d1rsb and 1rsb ( at @xmath92 ) .",
    "the paradigmatic example of such transitions is the fully - connected @xmath93-spin model  @xcite , where they are encountered upon lowering the temperature .",
    "let us stress that the above definitions are insensitive to what happens in a fraction of the space of configurations of vanishing measure . for instance , we neglect metastable states whose overall weight is exponentially small .    a convenient tool for distinguishing these various behaviors is the replicated free - entropy  @xcite , @xmath94 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary real number ( known as parisi replica symmetry breaking parameter ) which allows to weight differently the various pure states according to their sizes .",

    "the replica / cavity method at the level of one step of replica symmetry breaking allows to compute the replicated free - entropy @xmath101 under an appropriate hypothesis on the organization of pure states .",

    "let us first consider the case of a model of type ( [ eq : factor ] ) whose underlying factor graph is a tree , and discuss later how the long loops are taken into account by the cavity method .",

    ", when dealing with random factor graphs , one can always turn this simple computation into a probabilistic one , defining a distribution of random messages by reading ( [ eq_bp_atoi],[eq_bp_itoa ] ) in a distributional sense with random weight functions and variables degrees .",
    "the rs estimate of the average free entropy is then obtained by averaging the various terms in ( [ eq_bethe ] ) with respect to these random messages .",
    "this approach can be refined in d1rsb and 1rsb regimes .",

    "the possible use of this information in constructing solutions is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we thank florent krzakala and lenka zdeborova for several discussions on this project .",
    "in this section we discuss some issues related to the numerical resolution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_1rsb_q ] ) , ( [ eq_1rsb_p ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the 1rsb order parameter @xmath256 $ ] is approximated by a sample of @xmath555 populations , each composed of @xmath275 elements @xmath556 , @xmath557 $ ] , @xmath558 $ ] .",
    "the numerical results presented in this work have been obtained with @xmath559 and @xmath560 .",
    "the solution to the 1rsb cavity equations is found by an iterative procedure : starting from a `` good '' initial guess for the fixed point solution , we iterate a sampled version of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_1rsb_q ] ) , ( [ eq_1rsb_p ] ) .",
    "after some iterations the sample of populations converges to a stationary state with fluctuations of order @xmath561 .",
    "convergence to the stationary regime is usually fast and may take around @xmath562 iterations in the worst cases we encountered . once in the stationary regime , we keep iterating for at least @xmath563 steps",
    ". meanwhile we take averages ( over the populations and over the time evolution ) of the quantities of interest .",
    "this considerably reduces statistical errors .",
    "our actual numerical implementation makes use of two transformations with respect to eqs .",
    "( [ eq_1rsb_q ] ) , ( [ eq_1rsb_p ] ) .",
    "first , we make a change of variables into @xmath564 both taking values in @xmath116 $ ] ( note that the variable @xmath243 is defined non - negative , see the definition of the function @xmath565 in eq.([eq_recurs_def1 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover we exploit the fact that the reweighting term @xmath566 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_1rsb_q ] ) is a function of @xmath567 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq_def_z4 ] ) ) .",
    "this allows to transfer all the effects of reweighting to the other equation . denoting @xmath568 and @xmath569 the new distributions ,",
    "these two transformations lead to @xmath570\\label{eq : hq}\\\\ \\hp(\\bullet ) & \\eqd & \\frac{1}{z }   \\int \\prod_{i=1}^{l_+ } \\!\\de \\hq_i^+(\\varphi_i^+ ) \\prod_{i=1}^{l_- } \\!\\de \\hq_i^-(\\varphi_i^-)\\ ; \\delta\\left[\\bullet - \\frac{\\prod_i      \\varphi_i^-}{\\prod_i \\varphi_i^+ + \\prod_i \\varphi_i^-}\\right ] \\left(\\prod_i \\varphi_i^+ + \\prod_i \\varphi_i^-\\right)^m\\label{eq : hp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath571 in the last equation is obtained by normalization .",
    "one delicate issue in solving this kind of equation is how to represent faithfully the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hp ] ) by a sample of @xmath275 representative elements of @xmath572 , because of the reweighting term @xmath573 .",
    "a possible solution  @xcite consists in first generating a larger number , say @xmath574 , of outgoing fields , store them along with the associated weights , and then perform a resampling step to extract @xmath275 elements from this intermediate population .",
    "this approach has the advantage of having complexity independent of the distributions @xmath575 .",
    "unhappily if the weights are strongly concentrated on a small subset of the @xmath576 fields , the resampled population will have many copies of these elements .",
    "this leads to a deterioration of the sample .",
    "we adopted a different strategy whose running time depends on how strong is the reweighting . for @xmath577 ,",
    "we generate fields sequentially , and include them in the new population with probability proportional to the reweighting factor ( divided by the normalization factor @xmath578 ) .",
    "this procedure becomes slower when @xmath4 grows , but it ensures that no repetitions appear in the new sample .    solving the equations for @xmath579 is instead much easier and no particular care is needed . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we have used the same algorithm as for @xmath577 ( which now produces many repetitions in the populations ) and we have simply checked the validity of our results by changing the number and size of populations .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec_1rsb_m0 ] the cavity field distributions can have a positive weight on `` hard '' fields , i.e.  on fields that constrain a variable to take either value @xmath501 or @xmath212 in all solutions of the cluster .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath580 , or @xmath581 .",
    "this would show up into a positive fraction of the sample taking value , say , @xmath580 , thus leading to an inefficient representation .",
    "in order to circumvent this problem , we kept track explicitly of the weights on @xmath580 and @xmath582 , in analogy with eqs .",
    "( [ eq_1rsb_q_t0 ] ) , ( [ eq_1rsb_p_t0 ] ) .",
    "this also allows to locate more precisely the appearance of a positive fraction of hard fields in the distributions , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_frozenvar ] .",
    "there is unfortunately one drawback to this approach .",
    "consider eq .",
    "( [ eq : hp ] ) and suppose that all the distributions @xmath583 of the right hand sides are supported on @xmath584 $ ] . by definition",
    "the fields @xmath585 thus generated are also strictly positive .",
    "however the degrees @xmath445 are of order @xmath586 ( i.e.  around @xmath587 for @xmath588-sat in the 1rsb regime ) . as a consequence",
    ", it may happen that the product of the @xmath407 fields @xmath589 is smaller than the smallest number in the computer representation used ( using 64 bits and the denormalized floating point notation this limit is roughly @xmath590 ) .",
    "how should one treat such cases ? we have adopted the solution of ignoring , that is not including it in the population , any number below @xmath591 .",
    "this solution is equivalent to saying that we are describing with a finite population of numbers the distribution @xmath569 not on the domain @xmath592 $ ] , but on the domain @xmath593 $ ] .",
    "a different solution could be to convert all the numbers smaller than @xmath591 to zero .",
    "we have tried this procedure , but it seems to be unstable , and to introduce systematic errors . in particular one obtains a positive weight for @xmath594 , even for values of the parameters for which this is inconsistent .",
    "the last point we would like to discuss is the problem of how to initialize the population dynamics algorithm .",
    "it is clear that an iterative procedure does in general lead to different solutions depending on the starting point of the iterations .",
    "for instance the rs solution , where the distributions @xmath331 in @xmath261 are concentrated on a single value of @xmath244 , is always a fixed point of the 1rsb equations . in the case",
    "@xmath5 , the interpretation in terms of tree reconstruction  @xcite leads to a clear prescription for this initialization , as explained in more details in sec .",
    "[ sec_1rsb_m1 ] .",
    "one can follow the same procedure for other values of @xmath4 , namely initialize the populations with essentially only hard fields .",
    "this is crucial in particular for @xmath302 , where softer initial conditions lead to an unphysical fixed point , cf .",
    "[ appendix_k3 ] .",
    "in this appendix we provide the complete formulae for the dynamical transition regime of section [ sec : dynamicaltr ] . to leading order one can write a set of coupled equations for the average of @xmath507 , @xmath508 over the 1rsb order parameters @xmath261 , @xmath262 . with a slight abuse of notation we shall keep denoting by @xmath455 , @xmath456 such averages . in terms of this quantities",

    "@xmath12.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    this appendix provides further details on the numerical solution of the 1rsb equations for @xmath302 .",
    "a difficulty that arises in this case is the presence , for some values of @xmath12 and @xmath4 , of at least two distinct non - trivial solutions of the 1rsb equations ( this has been already noticed in  @xcite for @xmath603 , and in  @xcite for the related coloring problem ) . as a consequence",
    "the initial conditions of the iterative resolution play an important role in selecting the fixed point that shall be reached .",
    "one can justify the existence of multiple solutions as follows . as mentioned in the main text",
    ", the continuous dynamical transition at @xmath604 corresponds to a local instability of the rs solution with respect to 1rsb perturbations .",
    "it is important to underline that this instability condition is independent on the value of @xmath4 , that is at @xmath91 a new solution of the 1rsb equations should grow continuously away from the rs one , for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "these solutions do not contain hard fields in the neighborhood of @xmath91 . on the contrary it is known since  @xcite",
    "that another solution of the @xmath107 equations , with a finite weight on hard fields , arises discontinuously at @xmath605 . for larger values of @xmath12 these two solutions",

    "it remains to understand which , if any , of these solutions is the correct one . in principle one should test their stability with respect to higher level of replica symmetry breaking  @xcite , however it is an extremely demanding numerical task that we did not undertake .",
