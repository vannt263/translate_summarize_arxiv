    "as the study of galaxy formation comes more and more to require a reliable description of star - gas interactions and feedback on relatively small spatial scales , it is forced towards questions that overlap with fundamental issues in star formation theory .",
    "conversely , as evidence accumulates that most stars today  in environments ranging from the disk of the milky way to circumnuclear starbursts  are born not in isolation but in groups , the study of star formation in general seems increasingly to demand a focus on larger scales than might previously have been considered .",
    "although these two disciplines have not yet converged ",
    "the smallest scales currently of importance for galaxy formation can still be one or two orders of magnitude greater than the `` large '' scales in star formation  they will necessarily continue to approach one another as further progress is made .",
    "it is therefore important to identify and understand those areas of truly common interest , on the largest stellar scales and the smallest galactic ones . in many ways ,",
    "the systems of old globular clusters in galaxy halos are positioned just at this interface ; they can potentially be exploited to constrain aspects of both local and global star - formation processes , in both protogalactic and present - day settings .",
    "it has , indeed , long been recognized that the global properties of globular cluster systems ( gcss ) might be used to good effect as probes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "( this is especially true of bright early - type galaxies , whose gcss are more populous and better studied than those in typical spirals like the milky way . ) for example , following the suggestion that large fractions of the gcss in ellipticals may have formed in major merger events ( e.g. , schweizer 1987 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; zepf & ashman 1993 ) , and the related discovery of young super star clusters in systems like the antennae galaxies ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) , much recent discussion has centered on the interpretation of the distribution of metallicities ( or broad - band colors ) among e - galaxy globulars as clues to their hosts dynamical histories ( see geisler , lee , & kim 1996 ; forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 ; ct , marzke , & west 1998 ; kissler - patig , forbes , & minniti 1998 ) .",
    "a somewhat older approach has used just the total population of gcss , as a function of parent galaxy luminosity , hubble type , and local environment , to make arguments relating to issues such as biasing in a cold dark matter cosmology ( west 1993 ) ; the merger history of ellipticals ( harris 1981 ; van den bergh 1984 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; forbes et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the formation of cd galaxies and their envelopes ( mclaughlin , harris , & hanes 1993 , 1994 ) ; star formation in galaxies at the centers of cluster cooling flows ( harris , pritchet , & mcclure 1995 ) ; the influence of early galactic winds on the evolution of giant ellipticals ( harris , harris , & mclaughlin 1998 ) ; and even larger - scale aspects of galaxy clusters such as populations of intergalactic stars ( e.g. , west et al .  1995 ; harris et al .",
    "yet a third characteristic of gcss  their radial distributions ( the projected number density of globulars around a galaxy as a function of galactocentric radius)has also served as the basis for discussions of elliptical galaxy formation ( e.g. , harris 1986 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; kissler - patig 1997 ; van den bergh 1998 ) .",
    "rather less developed , however , is a clear sense of the relevance of gcss to _ local _ star formation on smaller scales : what relation , if any , do the fundamental properties of globular cluster systems bear to the way stars form now , in the dense clumps within galactic giant molecular clouds ?",
    "can the study of one of these phenomena possibly shed light on the other ?",
    "larson ( 1988 , 1993 , 1996 ) , has emphasized the possible parallels between the basic pattern of local star formation and the birth of globular clusters within large protogalactic clouds in a scenario for the collapse of galaxies from clumpy initial conditions ( as in , e.g. , the classic picture of searle & zinn 1978 , and current models of hierarchical galaxy formation ) . a more quantitative discussion along these lines , including an exposition of links to several of the gross characteristics of gcss , is given by harris & pudritz ( 1994 ) .",
    "most recently , mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1996 ) and elmegreen & efremov ( 1997 ) have focussed in detail on the globular cluster luminosity function ( the number of clusters per unit magnitude , from which may be derived the mass function @xmath11 for the entire system of globulars in a given galaxy ) in attempts to model this property of gcss using our current understanding of present - day star formation in molecular clouds and their clumps .",
    "the work presented in this paper further explores the connections between the formation of stars , globular clusters , and galaxies , by concentrating on two of the primary attributes of gcss : their specific frequencies ( or total populations ) and radial distributions .",
    "the next section discusses the significance of these gcs properties as they relate to general questions on the formation of stellar clusters . in  3 below , data are compiled from the literature , and a geometrical deprojection algorithm applied , to construct _ volume _ density profiles for the stars , the x - ray gas , and the globular clusters in three galaxies with well studied gcss : m87 ( the cd at the center of the virgo cluster ) , m49 ( giant elliptical in virgo ) , and ngc 1399 ( cd galaxy in the fornax cluster ) .",
    "an intercomparison of the density profiles of the three halo components yields a point - by - point measure of the gcs contribution to the total luminous mass in each system , as a function of _ three - dimensional _ galactocentric radius , @xmath12 .",
    "these gcs mass ratios , which are constant throughout each galaxy ( at large @xmath12 ) and the same in all three , are interpreted as an indication of the formation efficiency of globular clusters . in ",
    "4 , these results are supplemented with broader considerations of the gcss in other early - type galaxies and in the milky way halo , and with a direct estimate for the relative formation rate of open clusters in the galactic disk , to argue for the existence of a _ universal efficiency , or probability , for the formation of a bound stellar cluster from a dense cloud of gas_. section 5 discusses the implications of this for a few specific issues in galaxy and gcs formation and evolution , and  6 concludes with a summary .",
    "the possibility that globular cluster systems can be connected not only to galaxy formation , but to ongoing star formation as well , is suggested by the fact that this latter process operates largely in a _ clustered mode _ : by mass , most new stars in the milky way appear in groups within the largest clumps in molecular clouds , and only rarely in true isolation .",
    "this is , by now , an established empirical fact ( e.g. , lada et al .",
    "1991 ; zinnecker et al .",
    "1993 ) , and it is easily seen ( patel & pudritz 1994 ) to be a direct consequence of the different power - law slopes in the mass function of molecular clumps ( @xmath13 , so that the largest clumps , which weigh in at @xmath14@xmath15 , contain most of the star - forming gas mass in any molecular cloud ) and the stellar initial mass function ( @xmath16 , putting most of the mass in young stars into @xmath17 objects ) .",
    "similarly , young super star clusters , which tend to have sizes and masses that are generally comparable to the old globulars in the milky way , can account for as much as @xmath1820% of the uv light in starburst galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "this is , however , _ not _ to say that all , or even most , stars are born into bona fide clusters that exist as coherent dynamical units for any length of time ; on the contrary , it would appear that very few multiple - star systems actually form as gravitationally bound clusters .",
    "( a quantification of `` very few '' is one of the goals of this paper . ) at some point during the collapse and fragmentation of a cluster - sized cloud of gas , the massive stars which it has formed will expel any remaining gas by the combined action of their stellar winds , photoionization , and supernova explosions . if the _ cumulative _ star formation efficiency of the cloud , @xmath19 , is below a critical threshold when the gas is lost , then the blow - out carries away sufficient energy that the stellar group remaining is unbound , and disperses into the field .",
    "the precise value of this threshold sfe depends on details of the dynamics and magnetic field in the gas cloud before its self - destruction , and on the timescale over which the massive stars dispel the gas ; but various estimates place it in the range @xmath200.5 ( e.g. , hills 1980 ; mathieu 1983 ; elmegreen & clemens 1985 ; verschueren 1990 ; lada , margulis , & dearborn 1984 )",
    ".    a complete theory of star formation must therefore be able to anticipate the final cumulative sfe in any single piece of gas with ( say ) a given mass and density , and thereby predict whether or not it will form a bound cluster .",
    "no such theory yet exists .",
    "more within reach are considerations of a statistical nature , in which a _ distribution _ of cumulative sfes ( and , thus , the fraction of clouds that achieve @xmath21 before self - destruction ) is calculated for an ensemble of star - forming clouds , in either a protogalactic or a present - day context ( see , e.g. , elmegreen 1983 ; elmegreen & clemens 1985 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "but even here , the systematic effects of a range in the initial masses of the gaseous clouds , or of changes in the assumed star formation law ( which is probably the most outstanding `` free '' parameter here ) have not been explored fully .",
    "it is therefore not clear that the dominant factor governing the formation of bound stellar clusters vs.  unbound associations has been identified .",
    "it is nonetheless possible to constrain any forthcoming theories of star and cluster formation with empirical evaluations of the probability that a cluster - sized cloud of gas is able to achieve a cumulative sfe of at least the critical 20%50% .",
    "this probability  which can equally well be interpreted as that fraction of an ensemble of massive star - forming clouds which manages to produce bound stellar systems  is referred to here as the efficiency of cluster formation . as was indicated above , an estimate of this",
    "will be taken first from a detailed investigation of the old globular cluster populations in three giant elliptical galaxies ; general arguments will then be used to show that the result also applies to globular cluster formation in other galaxies , and to the formation of disk clusters today .",
    "a first ( and very rough ) assessment of the formation efficiency of globular clusters appeals to the most basic and most easily measured observable of a gcs : namely , its total population , @xmath22 , summed over all cluster luminosities and galactocentric positions .",
    "this is usually compared to the integrated @xmath23-band luminosity of the parent galaxy s halo ( as a measure of its unclustered field star population ) through the so - called specific frequency ( harris & van den bergh 1981 ) : @xmath24 even though any observational derivation of @xmath3 necessarily involves ( possibly large ) extrapolations of data that directly count only the brightest clusters in some spatially limited subset of a gcs , these estimates tend usually to be surprisingly robust . to date , specific frequencies have been obtained for of order 100 galaxies , some 80% of which are early - type systems ( see the compilations of harris 1991 ; durrell et al .  1996 ; kissler - patig 1997 ; blakeslee 1997 ; blakeslee , tonry , & metzger 1997 ; harris et al .",
    "1998 ) . given this bias in the observational database ,",
    "some of what follows will make use of results that are really specific to elliptical galaxies ; spirals are brought more explicitly into the discussion in  4 below .    specific frequency",
    "is easily related to the total masses of a galaxy s gcs and of its unclustered halo stars , if both the mean mass of the individual globulars in the system and the mass - to - light ratio of the overall _ stellar _ component are known . as is discussed further in  3.1 below",
    ", the basic distribution of globular cluster masses is quite similar from galaxy to galaxy , so that the mean cluster mass in the milky way gcs@xmath25serves as a reliable estimate for other systems as well .",
    "meanwhile , the stellar mass - to - light ratios of large galaxies are essentially equal to the dynamical @xmath26 in their _ cores _ , which are baryon - dominated . as is also discussed below (  4.1 ) ,",
    "observations show that the core @xmath26 of hot galaxies increases with luminosity ; but , even though this turns out to be rather an important consideration in detail , it will suffice for now to use a single value of @xmath27 as a rough characterization of large ellipticals ( van der marel 1991 ; cf .",
    "faber & gallagher 1979 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) . the definition of @xmath3 in equation ( [ eq:21 ] ) may then be rewritten as ( cf .",
    "zepf & ashman 1993 ; harris & pudritz 1994 ; harris et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath28 to be clear , it is stressed again that the mass - to - light ratio applied here refers to measurements in the cores of ellipticals , and is not meant to include any dark matter other than stellar remnants . in any event , an inversion of this last expression yields @xmath29 where @xmath30 is suggested by the studies cited above as a representative value for early - type galaxies ranging in luminosity from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "of course , there is some uncertainty in this `` mean '' @xmath3 , and some intrinsic scatter about it .",
    "moreover , the data suggest that @xmath3 varies systematically with @xmath9the simple scaling @xmath33 that corresponds to a constant specific frequency is not strictly obeyed  particularly among dwarf ellipticals and between brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "these issues have been discussed in detail in the literature , and they are revisited here , in  2.2 . with this caveat in mind , however , @xmath34 is useful as a crude , order - of - magnitude guide to a `` typical '' global gcs mass ratio in galaxy halos .",
    "the advantage of working in terms of this _ mass _ ratio is that , whatever its precise value in any one system at the current epoch , it is expected to be a fairly well conserved quantity that has not changed drastically over the course of gcs and galaxy evolution in a hubble time .",
    "_ this is true even though the total population @xmath35 of any gcs is bound to decrease over time _",
    ", as individual globulars are disrupted by the cumulative effects of external gravitational shocks and internal two - body relaxation ( see , e.g. , aguilar , hut , & ostriker 1988 ; ostriker , binney , & saha 1989 ; capuzzo - dolcetta 1993 ; murali & weinberg 1997a , 1997b , 1997c ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; vesperini & heggie 1997 ; but cf .",
    "portegies zwart et al .",
    "these dynamical processes discriminate preferentially against low - mass and low - density globular clusters , and it turns out that even if large _ numbers _ of such objects are lost , no great change is effected in the total _ mass _ of the remaining gcs .",
    "this conclusion rests on the fact that the mass functions of gcss  particularly those in early - type galaxies  are shallow enough that most of the total @xmath36 is contained in the most massive members of the system ; but these are the least susceptible to dynamical destruction .",
    "the implication is that the total mass of a gcs may not change much over its lifetime ; thus , _ if _ the current stellar mass of a galaxy were a reliable indication of the total amount of gas that was initially available to form stars , then the presently observed ratio @xmath37 would serve as a rough , _ global _ estimate of the efficiency of globular cluster formation .",
    "note that this reasoning also shows that galactic halos can not be built up from disrupted globulars ; see , e.g. , ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) and harris & pudritz ( 1994 ) .",
    "( one of the main conclusions of this paper will be that , in fact , @xmath38 is _ not _ always an adequate measure of an initial gas supply , and that @xmath39 therefore can not always be equated directly to a cluster formation efficiency .",
    "however , since most previous discussions of gcs specific frequencies do draw on this simple assumption at some level , it is of interest to develop some of its implications . )",
    "a simple numerical example should emphasize the robustness of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , consider a newly formed system of globulars whose masses are distributed according to a power - law mass function between some lower and upper limits : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and reasonable choices for @xmath42 and @xmath43 may be @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "( the precise values are not critical here . )",
    "now let this gcs be eroded over @xmath2 yr , keeping in mind that each cluster in the system has a definite , mass - dependent lifetime against the dynamical mechanisms mentioned above . in a rough approximation to a combination of complicated processes , there is then a mass scale ( say @xmath46 ) above which few or no globulars will have disappeared by the current epoch .",
    "thus , the gcs mass function at @xmath47 is effectively unchanged , even after a hubble time , from the initial distribution .",
    "however , clusters with initial masses @xmath48 _ can _ have been removed from the system , and the gcs mass function below @xmath46 may differ significantly from its initial form .",
    "if this low - mass end of the evolved @xmath11 can also be described by a power - law , then the full , present - day gcs mass function is just @xmath49 where @xmath50 for consistency .",
    "observed gcss do , in fact , have mass functions that conform to roughly this sort of double power law ( harris & pudritz 1994 ; mclaughlin 1994 ; mclaughlin & pudritz 1996)although there is somewhat more structure than this at the highest cluster masses in @xmath11 , it can be safely ignored for the purposes of the present argument .",
    "empirically , the mass scale @xmath46 is _ always _ about @xmath51 ; at this mass , the logarithmic slope of @xmath52 changes rather abruptly from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , with precise values that can vary slightly from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "there are strong arguments to support the notion that observed gcs mass functions at @xmath47 are indeed accurate reflections of the formation distributions ( namely , the high - mass sides of @xmath55 in observed gcss show no significant variation with galactocentric radius inside a single system , and are quite similar  though not identical  from galaxy to galaxy ; see harris & pudritz 1994 ; mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , some theoretical studies ( e.g. , surdin 1979 ; okazaki & tosa 1995 ; vesperini 1997 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) have suggested that the shallower slopes at lower masses might be caused entirely by dynamical evolution from an initial @xmath56 , roughly as described above . in reality , this view could very well be too extreme : empirically , the system of young super star clusters in the antennae , which is not likely to have been severely affected by dynamical destruction , may have a mass function of the form ( [ eq:25 ] ) rather than ( [ eq:24 ] ) ( fritze - von alvensleben 1999 ) ; and theoretically , such an initial shape to @xmath55 may in fact be _ preserved _ during a hubble time of dynamical evolution ( vesperini 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the intent here is not necessarily to argue for an explanation of present - day gcs mass spectra in purely evolutionary terms , but to show that even if such is adopted as an extreme possibility , the implied time dependence of total gcs masses is quite weak",
    ".    given equations ( [ eq:24 ] ) and ( [ eq:25 ] ) , then , straightforward integrations allow for comparisons of the present gcs population to the initial one : @xmath57[1-(m_\\ell / m_*)^ { 1-\\gamma_1}]}\\over{(m_u / m_\\ell)^{\\gamma_2 - 1}-1}}\\right\\}\\ , \\label{eq:26}\\ ] ] and of the current total mass to its initial value : @xmath58[1-(m_\\ell / m_*)^ { 2-\\gamma_1}]}\\over{1-(m_\\ell / m_u)^{2-\\gamma_2}}}\\right\\}\\ .",
    "\\label{eq:27}\\ ] ] values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 may be taken as representative of the typical situation in elliptical galaxies ( harris & pudritz 1994 ; mclaughlin 1994 , 1995 ; mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ) .",
    "with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , it is then easily seen that @xmath64 in this simplistic scenario .",
    "thus , _ even though dynamical evolution reduces the total population of this hypothetical gcs by more than an order of magnitude , it diminishes the total mass by only _",
    "( the same line of argument also shows that the often appreciable uncertainties in the exact form of @xmath11 at cluster masses",
    "@xmath48or even blind extrapolations from observations of only brighter clusters  do not seriously bias observational estimates of @xmath36 in any galaxy . )",
    "this result is best interpreted as an estimate for the possible depletion of a gcs _ globally _",
    "( i.e. , spatially averaged over the whole of a parent galaxy ) , because the values of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath46 used are taken from observations of @xmath11 in projection , often over fairly large areas on the sky .",
    "thus , the normalization @xmath67 in equations ( [ eq:24 ] ) and ( [ eq:25 ] ) can be taken to include an implicit integration over galactocentric radius , and the exponents @xmath68 and mass scale @xmath46 to be appropriate averages .",
    "the importance of these considerations is not actually clear , since radial dependences are not expected theoretically in current models for the initial gcs mass function ( mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) and observational evidence for such trends at the current epoch is slight to non - existent ( e.g. , mclaughlin et al .",
    "1994 and harris et al .  1998",
    "; though see also kavelaars & hanes 1997 and murali & weinberg 1997b ) .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that dynamical friction , gravitational shocks , and even evaporation couple to galactic tidal fields in such a way that if a gcs s present - day mass function _ were _ sculpted to any great extent by these processes , then the _ local _ ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 would be expected to increase outwards from the center of the system , from values less than equation ( [ eq:28 ] ) at small galactocentric radii to near unity at large distances ( e.g. , beyond a stellar effective radius ; see especially murali & weinberg 1997b ) .",
    "returning now to the main issue , the global efficiency of globular cluster formation in a galaxy may be defined as @xmath71 where @xmath5 refers to the total gas supply that was available to the protogalaxy , whether in a rapid monolithic collapse or , more likely , in a slower assembly ( at high redshift ) of many distinct , subgalactic clouds . from the preceding discussion ,",
    "it is clear that if a newly formed gcs were able to evolve `` passively''that is , if its mass were potentially vulnerable only to reductions caused by forces internal to an isolated parent galaxy  then a present - day observation of @xmath36 would suffice , to at least a @xmath1825% level of accuracy globally , as a measure of @xmath72 .",
    "passive evolution also implies mass conservation for the galaxy as a whole , so that a reliable value for @xmath5 could be obtained , at any epoch , from an inventory of the total mass in gas plus unclustered stars and stellar remnants .",
    "thus , a good _ observational estimate _ of the global cluster formation efficiency in this simple situation is provided by @xmath73 which is expected to be nearly a time - independent quantity .",
    "realistically , of course , galaxies are not such pristine entities ; interactions between systems may effect significant changes in both @xmath36 and @xmath74 over time , making it difficult to evaluate ( or even clearly define ) initial gcs and gas masses .",
    "for example , the formation history of an elliptical may include major mergers with gas - rich spiral systems , and it has been proposed that these might involve the formation of new globular clusters and substantial increases in @xmath36 ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1992 ; kumai , basu , & fujimoto 1993a ) . alternatively , additional globulars might be captured by a large galaxy that accretes small , gas - poor systems ( e.g. , ct et al .  1998 ) or accumulates tidal debris from other members in a cluster of galaxies ( see muzzio 1987 ) .",
    "however , processes such as these also increase the total masses of gas and/or stars in the final system . in _",
    "large _ galaxies ( i.e. , in those that do not suffer significant gas loss from strong galactic winds ; cf .  ",
    "4.2 ) , any changes in the ratio @xmath75 are bound to be smaller than changes in either of these quantities individually .",
    "the presently observed @xmath76 in any large galaxy with a complex dynamical history is then a mass - weighted average of the true @xmath4 in some number of discrete star - formation events and individual accreted systems ; and in the limit that the underlying efficiency of cluster formation is independent of environment and epoch ( as the results of   3 and 4 will suggest is nearly correct ) , it is still true that @xmath77just as in the case of passive evolution , and subject only to the small error associated there with the effects of gcs erosion by cluster evaporation and tidal disruption .    in gas - poor elliptical galaxies and the halos of spirals , equation ( [ eq:210 ] ) reduces to @xmath78 , so that  as was mentioned above  the cluster formation efficiency can be obtained directly from obervations of the global gcs specific frequency ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ [ eq:23 ] ] )",
    ". more generally , however , ellipticals can contain large amounts of hot , x - ray emitting gas ( e.g. , forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ) , and when it happens that @xmath79 is non - negligible relative to @xmath38 , measurements of @xmath3 are only low - order approximations to @xmath80 ( which is itself only an estimate of the real efficiency @xmath4 ) . keeping this in mind , the observed systematics of both global _ and local _ gcs specific frequencies provide a useful starting point for an examination of the extent to which cluster formation efficiencies might vary from galaxy to galaxy , or from place to place within a single system .      as was intimated in the discussion around equation ( [ eq:23 ] ) ,",
    "not all galaxies have the same globular cluster specific frequency .",
    "there are several aspects to this : ( 1 ) spiral galaxies tend to have lower @xmath3at least when their gcs populations are normalized to their _ total _",
    "( bulge plus disk ) light ",
    "than do average ellipticals ( harris 1991 ) .",
    "( 2 ) although a constant @xmath30 is a fair _ approximation _ for many normal giant ellipticals , fits to the data suggest that , in fact , @xmath81 ( kissler - patig 1997 ; cf .",
    "santiago & djorgovski 1993 ) . at the extremes of the early - type galaxy sequence ,",
    "moreover , ( 3 ) the @xmath3 values for centrally dominant or first - ranked members of galaxy clusters show a much steeper dependence on galaxy luminosity@xmath82 or so is implied by the correlations of blakeslee ( 1997 ) and harris et al .",
    "( 1998)and ( 4 ) specific frequencies actually appear to increase towards _ lower _ luminosities in dwarf ellipticals : @xmath83 ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ; see also durrell et al .",
    "thus , some brightest cluster galaxies , and some of the faintest dwarfs , have global specific frequencies that exceed the `` average '' by factors of 3 or 4 .",
    "all in all , observed @xmath3 values span a range from @xmath181 to @xmath1820 .",
    "as will be shown in  4 below , the first two of these points can be understood fairly easily . here",
    ", it suffices to note that ( 1 ) when only the _ halo _ stars and globular clusters in the milky way are considered , and allowances made for the lower pop .",
    "ii mass - to - light ratio in our galaxy vs.  large ellipticals , @xmath80 here is no different from that in `` normal '' early - type systems .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this result  which is contrary to the claim made by zepf & ashman ( 1993)should hold in other spirals as well .",
    "also , ( 2 ) the observed dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath9 among non - brightest cluster ellipticals is fully consistent with that expected from equation ( [ eq:22 ] ) for gas - poor systems with a uniform efficiency of cluster formation ( @xmath84 ) and a mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath85 ) that scales with luminosity in the way observed for galaxies in the fundamental plane .",
    "however , if taken at face value , items ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) just above appear to imply that gcs formation efficiencies can vary by as much as an order of magnitude from galaxy to galaxy , in a non - monotonic fashion and for reasons that have never been understood .",
    "these issues are not so readily dismissed .",
    "the high @xmath3 `` phenomenon '' in many first - ranked cluster ellipticals , especially , has been discussed at length in the literature ( e.g. , mclaughlin et al .",
    "1994 ; harris et al .  1995 ; west et al .  1995 ; forbes et al .  1997 ; blakeslee 1997 ; blakeslee et al .  1997 ; harris et al .",
    "1998 ) , and is referred to here as the _ first specific frequency problem_. equally non - trivial , though only more recently recognized , is the _ inverse _ variation of @xmath3 with @xmath9 among dwarf ellipticals .    local specific frequencies , which are obtained for a single gcs by comparing its projected radial distribution to its galaxy s surface brightness profile ( normalized as in eq .",
    "[ [ eq:21 ] ] ) , are also of interest here ; they are related in the obvious way to the efficiency of cluster formation as a function of ( projected ) galactocentric radius , @xmath86 . of particular importance is the fact that @xmath3 is seen to be an _ increasing _ function of @xmath86 in many galaxies .",
    "this is equivalent to the well known fact that gcss are often less centrally concentrated than the stellar halos of their parent galaxies .",
    "this statement has two contexts , which must be separated .",
    "first , it seems that the gcs of most any galaxy  spiral or elliptical , small or large  has an apparent core radius that is significantly larger than that of the unclustered field stars ( e.g. , djorgovski & meylan 1994 ; lauer & kormendy 1986 ; mclaughlin 1995 ; forbes et al .  1996",

    "1998 ) ; that is , the _ central regions _ of gcss show projected radial distributions with slopes that are significantly shallower than those of the light profiles on kpc scales , so that the density ratio of the two halo components is an increasing function of radius .",
    "second , the gcss of some large galaxies are spatially more extended than the stellar halos on _ larger scales _",
    ", @xmath87100 kpc ( harris & racine 1979 ; harris 1986 ) . however , this is a less general result than that relating to the large core radii of globular cluster systems .",
    "it is true of many dominant cluster galaxies like m87 in virgo ( see the discussion in mclaughlin et al .",
    "1995 ) , and also of the m31 halo ( pritchet & van den bergh 1994 ) ; but many elliptical systems ( e.g. , durrell et al .  1996 ; kissler - patig et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the milky way itself ( harris 1976 ; zinn 1985 ) , show gcs and halo - star distributions that are in quite close agreement ( and , thus , a constant local @xmath3 ) outside of any core regions .",
    "the physical factors that govern whether the gcs density falls off at the same rate as or more slowly than the unclustered halo density in a given system have not yet been identified .",
    "( no case has ever been found in which a gcs radial distribution is _ steeper _ than a galaxy s light profile . )",
    "the first of these points is not easily related to the radial dependence of cluster formation efficiencies because , as was suggested in  2.1 , the dynamical mechanisms that act to destroy globulars work most efficiently at small @xmath86 , where the stellar densities are highest . although the cores of gcss could quite plausibly have always been somewhat larger than those of halos or bulges generally ( e.g. , harris & pudritz 1994 ; ct et al .",
    "1998 ) , it seems inevitable that any initial discrepancies must have been augmented by an inside - out erosion of the cluster system from tidal shocking , dynamical friction , and evaporation ( ostriker et al .  1989 ; capuzzo - dolcetta 1993 ; murali & weinberg 1997b ) .",
    "detailed modelling is therefore required to disentangle the effects of formation and evolutionary processes in this instance . at galactocentric",
    "radii greater than a few kpc , however , the timescales on which the evolutionary mechanisms operate can exceed a hubble time , and the studies cited here show that dynamics will not significantly affect gcs radial distributions beyond about one effective radius in the stellar halo ( see also aguilar et al .",
    "thus , to the extent that the assumption @xmath78 is valid , the distension of gcss relative to stellar halos and the concomitant systematic increase in local @xmath3 in the outer parts of _ some _ galaxies would seem to say that bound clusters were sometimes ( but not always , and for unknown reasons ) _ more _ likely to form at larger @xmath86 , in gas that was presumably at lower ambient densities and pressures . this situation will be referred to as the _ second specific frequency problem_.    it is clearly of interest , from the points of view of both galaxy and star formation , to verify whether these global and local @xmath3 variations really do reflect differences in @xmath4and , if so , to understand their origins .",
    "accordingly , much attention has been paid to the first @xmath3 problem in particular , usually in efforts to empirically correlate the @xmath3 measurements for brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) with global properties of the galaxies themselves or of the clusters they inhabit .",
    "one such correlation does appear to be of fundamental importance , as will be discussed momentarily , but it suggests that @xmath3 varies in the face of _ constant _ @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , no proposed solution of the first specific frequency problem has identified a physical mechanism that could possibly lead to the superefficient production of bound star clusters in some galaxies ( see the references given above ) .",
    "in fact , one suggestion  that high global specific frequencies ( meaning @xmath89 ) in centrally located bcgs result from the acquisition of globulars and stars which are tidally stripped from the outer , high-@xmath3 regions of other galaxies in a cluster  actually appears to rely on the existence of the _ second _ specific frequency problem ( see forbes et al .  1997 ; ct et al .",
    "1998 ) ; but this is itself essentially unexplained . nor , to date , has any explanation ( or prediction ) been given for the high @xmath3 that have now been observed in many faint dwarf galaxies .",
    "the view is taken here that _",
    "the second specific frequency problem is inseparable from the first _",
    ", in the specific sense that both relate to the possible influence of environment on the probability of bound cluster formation .",
    "any real insight into either one of these issues must therefore include a better understanding of the other .",
    "this view is in keeping with recent evidence ( forbes et al .",
    "1997 ; kissler - patig 1997 ; van den bergh 1998 ) for at least a rough correlation between global @xmath3 values and gcs density - profile slopes in elliptical galaxies : those gcss with the highest specific frequencies tend also to have the shallowest radial distributions .",
    "such a correspondence hints strongly at ( although it does not directly show ) an intimate connection between an increasing local @xmath3 and a high global @xmath3 .",
    "a significant development in this field has come with the recent recognition of a correlation between the global specific frequencies of bcgs and the x - ray luminosity of the hot gas in their parent clusters ( west et al .  1995 ;",
    "blakeslee 1997 ; blakeslee et al .",
    "a relatively large and homogeneous sample of bcgs shows @xmath3 values that increase from about 4 , in clusters with x - ray luminosities ( on 500-kpc scales ) @xmath90 erg s@xmath91 at 0.54.5 kev , to @xmath92 for @xmath93 erg s@xmath91 .",
    "three different interpretations have already been attached to this result :    west et al .",
    "( 1995 ) propose that it points to the existence of intergalactic globulars which collect naturally at the centers of galaxy clusters and are superimposed in projection on any galaxy there .",
    "this would certainly boost the apparent total population @xmath22 of a central bcg , so that globulars need not have formed in situ with abnormally high specific frequency ; but they would still have had to do so elsewhere in the cluster ( see also ct et al .",
    "1998 ; harris et al .  1998 ) .    in a different approach , blakeslee ( 1997 ) and blakeslee et al .",
    "( 1997 ) consider @xmath94 to be mainly a reflection of the temperature of intracluster gas , and thus a measure of a cluster s mass and the depth of its potential .",
    "they then claim that the observed @xmath3@xmath94 correlation is consistent with the globulars in bcgs having formed in numbers directly proportional to the _ total _ mass , including dark matter , of their _ entire _ galaxy clusters ( see kavelaars 1998 for a similar suggestion on the scale of individual galaxies ) . in this scenario ,",
    "cluster formation would obey a universal efficiency of sorts  although one which is quite different from that discussed here  and the first @xmath3 problem would result from some process that caused the bcgs in more massive clusters to be systematically underluminous ( i.e. , underefficient in the production of unclustered field stars ) . here , however , the role that the dark matter content of a galaxy cluster might play in the formation of globular clusters is not clear .",
    "moreover , any rule such as @xmath95 clearly can apply over only a limited range of conditions .",
    "thus , harris et al .  (",
    "1998 ) instead pursue the hypothesis that gcss formed with a constant @xmath4 defined essentially as in equation ( [ eq:29 ] ) above .",
    "this is adopted as a working _ assumption _ by harris et al .",
    ", who construct plausibility arguments for a universal value of @xmath96 ( as could be expected ) and suggest that the higher global @xmath3 in more x - ray luminous bcgs might have resulted from stronger ( partial ) galactic winds which heated larger fractions of their initial gas supplies to kev temperatures after an early bout of star and globular cluster formation",
    ". such hot gas would be largely removed from further star formation  but still confined to the vicinity of these central cluster galaxies  and the final bcgs would be optically underluminous as a result .    it is this basic idea that is closest to the discussion in this paper ( although many aspects of the quantitative analysis here differ significantly from those in harris et al .  1998 ) .",
    "that is , the fundamental point of the global @xmath3@xmath94 correlation for bcgs is the associated implication that the first specific frequency problem may stem , not from intrinsic variations in the global @xmath4 of these systems , but from the fact that they can contain large amounts of gas .",
    "high gas mass ratios invalidate the assumption that @xmath84 , and therefore cause @xmath3 to overestimate the true globular cluster formation efficiency .",
    "if it is correct to infer from this that the `` excess '' globulars in systems with high global @xmath3 are associated with hot gas , then the fact that the distribution of gas is generally more extended than that of the stars in ellipticals ( e.g. , trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares 1986 ; fabbiano 1989 ) suggests a possible explanation for the second specific frequency problem as well as the first .",
    "these two issues would then be closely related  possibly even just different aspects of a single phenomenon  as was suggested above ; and both might be settled simply by measuring the full estimator @xmath97 both locally and globally in individual systems .    in the next section , this universal-@xmath4 hypothesis is _ tested _ , for the first time , by evaluating the observable @xmath80 as a function of galactocentric radius in each of the galaxies m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 .",
    "it turns out that the inclusion of the x - ray gas in m87 is indeed key to the alleviation of both the first and the second @xmath3 problems there : once this is done , @xmath80 is constant locally , and essentially the same globally , in all three of these systems .",
    "the discussion is expanded to include other giant ellipticals and bcgs , as well as dwarf ellipticals , in  4 .",
    "it is shown directly that all available gcs data are consistent with a single efficiency of cluster formation .",
    "notably , the increase of @xmath3 towards low @xmath9 in the dwarfs ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ; durrell et al .",
    "1996 ) can be explained in terms of this universal @xmath4 once allowances are made for the effects of the violent gas outflows ( a more extreme version of the feedback envisioned by harris et al .",
    "1998 for bcgs ) that were driven by early bursts of star formation in these low - mass systems .",
    "m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 are ideally suited to a closer examination of these issues , for three reasons : ( 1 ) they are relatively nearby , making it possible to observe internal trends within the systems in the first place .",
    "m87 and m49 both are assumed here to lie at a distance of @xmath98 mpc , appropriate for the core of the virgo cluster ( pierce et al .  1994 ; freedman et al .",
    ". a relative distance modulus of @xmath99=0.2 $ ] ( e.g. , mcmillan , ciardullo , & jacoby 1993 ; tonry et al .",
    "1997 ) then puts ngc 1399 at @xmath100 mpc .",
    "( 2 ) each is a giant elliptical ( m87 and ngc 1399 are actually type cd ) , and is therefore accompanied by a large gcs : @xmath101 for m87 ; @xmath102 for m49 ; and @xmath103 in ngc 1399 ( e.g. , harris 1991 ; see also  5 below ) . and",
    ", most importantly , ( 3 ) even this small sample of three galaxies suffices to bring out all aspects of the two specific frequency problems summarized in  2.2 : m87 , as is well known , suffers from both ; m49 does not show the first , but has long been thought to exhibit the second ; and ngc 1399 has been claimed as an example of the first problem , but not the second .",
    "because of their proximity , these systems have been well studied in all respects of importance here .",
    "@xmath104-band surface photometry extends in m87 to a projected galactocentric radius of about @xmath105 kpc ( de vaucouleurs & nieto 1978 , 1979 ) ; in m49 , to a similar distance ( king 1978 ; caon , capaccioli , & donofrio 1994 ) ; and in ngc 1399 , to @xmath106 kpc ( killeen & bicknell 1988 ; caon et al .",

    "these studies all give the _ volume _ electron density @xmath108 , as a function of _ three - dimensional _ galactocentric radius , derived either from fits of a parametric function to the projected x - ray brightness profile or from a direct deprojection of the same .",

    " this is generally _ not _ so for gcs radial distributions .",
    "older , photographic surveys , which did have large ( @xmath112 kpc ) fields of view , were hampered by rather bright limiting magnitudes that became systematically more so towards smaller galactocentric radii .",
    "newer , ccd photometry achieves deeper limiting magnitudes , and digital data reduction techniques can quantify and correct for any spatial variations ; but until very recently , ccd fields of view were quite small , and best suited to analyses of the central regions ( @xmath113 kpc ) of gcss .",
    "thus , the first step in comparing the stellar , gaseous , and globular cluster contents of any large galaxy is to combine existing photographic and ccd gcs data into a single , composite radial distribution that gives the projected density @xmath114 , to a uniform limiting magnitude , over as large a range of galactocentric radius as possible .",
    "this is done for each of m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 in  3.1 .",

    "thus , to discuss these three components simultaneously in m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 , either ( 1 ) their gcs and stellar surface densities can be deprojected and compared to their derived gas volume densities , or ( 2 ) the gas surface densities , @xmath117 , can be obtained from the published volume density profiles and compared to the directly observed @xmath107 and @xmath118 .",
    "the results of these two separate exercises are presented in ",
    " 3.2 and 3.3 .",
    "when joining gcs radial distributions from two or more separate studies of the same galaxy , two important factors must be taken into account .",

    "the surface density of this `` background , '' @xmath120 , is subtracted from the total density of point sources at any @xmath86 to form the surface density profile @xmath121 of the gcs alone ; but @xmath120 is a function of seeing conditions , detector characteristics , and limiting magnitude .",
    "background corrections must therefore be applied separately to each of the datasets to be combined .",
    "second , differences in limiting magnitude ( call this @xmath122 ) are of further importance because a deep survey will clearly see more globulars , at a given @xmath86 , than one with a bright limit . before they can be simply matched onto one another , then , distinct background - corrected profiles @xmath110 must be normalized to the same effective @xmath122 .    the published gcs observations that will be used here for m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "= 4.0truein    a few practical notes should be made regarding this scaling procedure .",
    "first , it is applied to the gcs densities at every observed galactocentric radius , and it therefore assumes that there is no intrinsic radial variation in the gclf or the underlying gcs mass function . as was also mentioned in  2.1 above ,",
    "this is a reasonable assumption that is directly supported by the observations themselves .",
    "second , the limiting magnitudes for the photographic studies of harris & petrie ( 1978 ) and harris ( 1986 ) are rather poorly determined ; harris quotes only approximate ranges for @xmath159 .",
    "the values adopted here , which are fully consistent with these ranges , have been chosen to give scaled @xmath110 that agree well with more recent ccd studies with accurately known @xmath122 .",
    "and third , the scaling applied to the m49 gcs counts of harris & van den bergh ( 1981 ) has not been calculated in this way at all ; rather , the factor of 0.86 is derived , by harris ( 1986 ) , by requiring a good overall agreement with the @xmath121 profile of harris & petrie ( 1978 ) .",
    "the results of this exercise are illustrated in fig .",
    "clearly , the different projected density profiles in each gcs corroborate each other .",
    "it remains only to extract a single @xmath121 at each @xmath86 , in each system , from the overlapping data that have been collected .",
    "it is not generally possible to simply average different densities at a given @xmath86 , since profiles such as these are constructed by counting clusters in a series of wide , circular annuli that need not coincide from study to study . instead , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that a perfectly acceptable approach is to simply adopt one of the ( scaled ) profiles over some range in @xmath86 , and then switch to any other that might extend beyond that range . at this point",
    ", it must be kept in mind that ultimately the data will be deprojected to yield volume gcs densities , @xmath160 .",
    "the method developed in the appendix to do this requires that the inner and outer radii be known for the annuli used to define the composite @xmath121 .",
    "this further restricts the useful published datasets to those which contain this information on the radial bins as well ( that is , _ in addition _ to just a density and a mean radius for each annulus ) .    in m87 ,",
    "then , a composite gcs profile is derived by using the data of mclaughlin ( 1995 ) from @xmath161 to @xmath162 ; those of mclaughlin et al .",

    "there are two details of particular note .",

    "first , then , the projected mass densities of gas are obtained from the volume density profiles in equations ( [ eq:311 ] ) , ( [ eq:312 ] ) , and ( [ eq:313 ] ) , by way of the standard integral @xmath284 where the coordinate @xmath285 measures distance along the line of sight , and @xmath286 represents the total physical extent of the x - ray corona . for m87 ,",

    "moreover , the constants of proportionality are in reasonable agreement with the @xmath80 derived from the deprojected data : by taking the direct mean of the surface - density ratios beyond the galaxies effective radii ( so as once again to avoid a zone of potential gcs erosion ) , it is found that @xmath289 the result for m49 is indistinguishable from that obtained in either  3.1 or  3.2 , owing to the truly low gas densities in this galaxy .",
    "similarly , the projected @xmath80 in ngc 1399 is identical , within the uncertainties , to the deprojected quantity @xmath290 .",
    "the number in equation ( [ eq:318 ] ) is formally 10% smaller because of the apparently large projected gas densities at radii @xmath29150 kpc in ngc 1399 .",
    "however , these values are almost certainly overestimates : in deriving @xmath279 , the shallow volume density profile of equation ( [ eq:312 ] ) , which roughly has @xmath292 , has been assumed to hold even on mpc spatial scales in fornax ",
    "well beyond the range of actual x - ray observations  and this is likely unrealistic . on the other hand , the projected @xmath293 indicated for m87 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] might genuinely be slightly smaller than the @xmath294 inferred from deprojected quantities .",
    "the 20% difference between these two numbers is significant at just the 1-@xmath231 level , however , and  although it is interesting that the former is actually closer to the values for m49 and ngc 1399it is not obvious which is more reliable . the x - ray gas density around m87 ( eq .  [ [ eq:311 ] ] )",
    "has again been extrapolated to unobserved radii to compute @xmath279 , but in this case the basic profile actually follows the dark matter distribution in virgo ( mclaughlin 1999 ) , and exhibits a realistic , steepening slope at large @xmath12 .",
    "thus , although it is possible that @xmath295 is overestimated at large @xmath86 in m87 , any argument for this is not as compelling as in ngc 1399 .    the best measure of @xmath80 in m87 will therefore be taken as the error - weighted mean of the values ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq:316 ] ] and [ [ eq:318 ] ] ) obtained by analyzing the deprojected and projected data there ; in m49 , the choice is of no consequence , but for definiteness the deprojected @xmath80 will be adopted ; and the deprojected estimate will also be adopted for ngc 1399 , to avoid any concerns that its gas surface density might have been overestimated at large @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath296 once again , these can be seen as estimates of either local or global cluster formation efficiencies if the inner several kpc of m87 and m49 are excluded from the discussion .",
    "the results of the previous section clearly show that _ working in terms of stellar masses rather than luminosities and including the gas in m87 removes both the first and second specific frequency problems there _ : in all three of m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 , it is found that @xmath282 , in identical proportions within the uncertainties , outside of the central , possibly dynamically depleted regions of the gcss .",
    "( at the most , differences between the constants of proportionality in m87 and m49 might remain at the @xmath1820% level ; but again , this is easily taken up in the observational uncertainties , and in any case is a significant improvement over the 300% difference in their specific frequencies . )",
    "the interpretation put to this is that globular clusters formed with an essentially constant efficiency throughout all of these galaxies , at the level of @xmath297 which is the error - weighted mean of equation ( [ eq:319 ] ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that these are all large galaxies with complex evolutionary histories .",
    "thus , as was discussed in  2.1 , what has been measured here is necessarily a _ mass - weighted average _ of @xmath88 , possibly over multiple distinct episodes of in situ cluster formation and/or of the accretion of globulars formed elsewhere .",
    "nevertheless , the uniformity of the observational estimates @xmath298 in these systems  both as a function of @xmath12 within each and from one entire system to another  suggests that these concerns may not be too severe , and that equation ( [ eq:41 ] ) may still serve as a reliable guide to a single , possibly universal efficiency for cluster formation .",
    "this impression can now be checked quantitatively , albeit to rather lower precision than has proved possible with the excellent datasets for m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 , by appealing to observations of many other gcss .",
    "all indications are that @xmath4 is indeed similar , at least to first order , from galaxy to galaxy and from the protogalactic epoch to the present .      given the definition for @xmath80 ( eq .  [ [ eq:210 ] ] ) , and denoting by @xmath299 the global ratio @xmath300 in a galaxy , the total population of any gcs may be written as @xmath301 this can , of course , also be derived from equation ( [ eq:22 ] ) above , which explicitly relates @xmath3 to @xmath80 when @xmath302 .",
    "now , in the general discussion of  2 , the stellar mass - to - light ratio was taken to be roughly similar from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "this is not exactly true , however : as was seen in  3 , for example , the recovery of similar @xmath80 in m87 and m49 from their significantly different global and local @xmath3 depends on the @xmath1040% larger @xmath190 of m87 as well as on its greater gas mass .",
    "thus , if other ellipticals are to be brought properly into this discussion , it is necessary first to account for the fact that @xmath303 depends systematically on galaxy luminosity .",
    "this is a well known result of many fundamental - plane analyses of bright ellipticals , and it can be incorporated quantitatively in this analysis by referring to the study of van der marel ( 1991 ; and references therein ) .",
    "specifically , for a sample of 37 early - type systems , van der marel obtains a mean @xmath304-band mass - to - light ratio of @xmath305 , corresponding to @xmath306 , at a mean magnitude of @xmath307 . for a galaxy color of @xmath308 ( typical of large ellipticals ) and @xmath309",
    "km s@xmath91 mpc@xmath91 , this result corresponds to @xmath310 at an absolute magnitude of @xmath311 , or @xmath312 . in addition to this",
    ", van der marel ( 1991 ) finds that @xmath303 increases with @xmath313 as a power law with exponent @xmath314 . since other studies of the fundamental plane",
    "have claimed a slightly shallower exponent of 0.250.30 ( e.g. , faber et al .",
    "1987 ; pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1995 , and references therein ) , @xmath315 is adopted here .",
    "thus , @xmath316 it should be noted again that these mass - to - light ratios refer to the stellar populations in the cores of the galaxies , and are not unduly influenced by any dark matter on larger scales . if equation ( [ eq:43 ] ) is used in ( [ eq:42 ] ) , the dependence @xmath317 , or @xmath318 , emerges naturally for constant @xmath80 and @xmath299 .",
    "this is essentially the scaling found empirically by kissler - patig ( 1997 ) .",
    "the other point of concern is , of course , the hot gas content of ellipticals in general . to get a rough handle on this , notice that the ( soft ) x - ray luminosities of early - type systems scale with their blue luminosities as @xmath319 , with @xmath3203 ( and with significant scatter about the mean trend :",
    "e.g. , forman et al .",

    "as was discussed in  2.1 , the formation of stellar clusters continues to be an important element of star formation in general , and the existence of an apparently universal formation efficiency for globular clusters must reflect a generic piece of this process .",
    "however , the picture may still be incomplete : although the discussion to this point has included clusters that formed in a wide variety of environments  at galactocentric distances @xmath423100 kpc , in galaxies spanning four orders of magnitude in total luminosity and inhabiting both poor groups and rich clusters  all of these formed at essentially a single epoch , and under physical conditions that were possibly much more extreme than those in , say , the disk of the milky way today .",
    "it is important , therefore , to compare the protogalactic @xmath424 to the frequency with which bound star clusters form in a typical quiescent galaxy at the current epoch .",
    "disk clusters in the milky way present one opportunity to do this .",
    "the rate of open cluster formation in the solar neighborhood has been estimated by elmegreen & clemens ( 1985 ) as @xmath425 clusters kpc@xmath188 yr@xmath91 . if the masses of the clusters range between @xmath426 and @xmath427 according to @xmath428 ( from the luminosity spectrum @xmath429 of van den bergh & lafontaine 1984 ) , then a mean mass of @xmath430 is indicated , and the formation rate becomes @xmath431 kpc@xmath188 yr@xmath91 .",
    "this is to be compared with the _ total _ star formation rate in the solar neighborhood , which includes those stars appearing in loose groups and unbound associations ( or even in relative isolation ) as well as in bound clusters .",

    "this is consistent with the classic estimate ( e.g. , roberts 1957 ) of about 10% .",
    "however , the globular cluster @xmath80 has been obtained here as a _",
    "mass _ ratio , since this is the observable quantity that can be related directly to its formation value ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq:28 ] ] ) . to make a proper comparison with open cluster formation",
    ", it is therefore necessary to refer the mass going into newborn clusters ( per unit area , per unit time ) to the total mass of gas available for any kind of star formation .",
    "this latter figure can be derived from @xmath434 using the mean star formation efficiency , @xmath435 , averaged over many of the dense , star - forming ( not necessarily cluster - forming ) cores in giant molecular clouds .",
    "this number is only poorly known , but statistical arguments ( e.g. , elmegreen 1983 ) suggest that it lies at the level of @xmath436%10% .",
    "thus , @xmath437 which is in reasonably good agreement with the result for globular cluster systems . the numerical value in equation ( [ eq:49 ] ) clearly should not be taken as definitive , given the very rough , order - of - magnitude nature of the argument that has produced it .",
    "that said , however , it is just the order - of - magnitude agreement between equations ( [ eq:49 ] ) and ( [ eq:41 ] ) which suggests that the basic mechanism of cluster formation may not have changed appreciably from protogalactic times to the present .",
    "another obvious place to check the current level of @xmath4 is in starbursts and merging galaxies , which are forming massive young clusters in substantial numbers ( e.g. , whitmore & schweizer 1995 ; meurer et al .",
    "complete inventories of the star - forming gas mass in individual systems , and of the total mass in those of their young clusters that can be shown to be gravitationally bound ( which to date has been done rigorously for only two objects : ho & filippenko 1996a , 1996b ) , would be of considerable interest .",
    "the results should be of particular relevance to the oft - made claim , which is now at the center of some debate ( sternberg 1998 ; brodie et al .",
    "1998 ) , that these super star clusters are the modern - day equivalents of young globulars .",
    "if it turns out , for example , that strongly bound clusters in starbursts are forming in numbers very much in excess of those expected on the basis of @xmath438 ( as , e.g. , the uv observations of meurer et al .  1995 appear to suggest ) , then these spectacular events might _ not _ be representative of a ubiquitous phase in the formation of average elliptical galaxies .",
    "the fact that the @xmath4 values inferred here are everywhere so similar  over large ranges in radius inside m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 ; from dwarf ellipticals to brightest cluster galaxies ; and from massive , old globular clusters to smaller , much younger open clusters  should serve as a strong constraint on theories of star formation .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that the probability of attaining a cumulative star formation efficiency of @xmath43950% ( see  2.1 ) in any dense clump of gas more massive than @xmath440@xmath15 ( so from open clusters on up ) can depend only weakly , on average , on local environment ( i.e. , the density and pressure of ambient gas ) or on factors such as global background density ( meaning , e.g. , in the protogalactic context , a 1-@xmath231 vs.  a 3-@xmath231 density fluctuation ; or a poor group of galaxies vs.  a rich cluster ) .",
    "moreover , implicit in plots like figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] is the fact that cluster formation efficiencies are also rather insensitive to metallicity : the mean abundances of the globulars in the galaxies represented there range over two orders of magnitude , from @xmath441\\simeq-2 $ ] to @xmath441\\simeq0 $ ] ( see durrell et al .  1996 ; forbes et al .",
    "1997 ) . over a remarkably broad spectrum of physical conditions",
    ", therefore , it appears that similar fractions of star - forming gas  always about 0.25% by mass  are able to produce bound stellar clusters .",
    "the implicitly mass - averaged nature of the observational estimates of @xmath4 has to be kept in mind , but would seem to be of little concern in most cases .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to place the efficiency of cluster formation alongside the globular cluster mass function @xmath11 ( mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 ) and the mean globular cluster mass @xmath176 ( e.g. , fig .  [ fig2 ] above ) as robust and nearly universal physical quantities that must be derived from the most general aspects of the star formation process .    as a corollary to this , one implication of figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] above is that the efficiency of _ unclustered _ star formation could _ not _ have been universal .",
    "that is , in both dwarf elliptical and brightest cluster galaxies , where the data are consistent with @xmath442 having been constant in the mean , globular clusters apparently did form in precisely the numbers expected for the total amount of gas initially available to these systems .",
    "but then , the higher than average specific frequencies there are inferred to reflect larger ratios of @xmath443 , so that lower than average amounts of this gas were converted into field stars .",
    "the data for dwarfs agree with a simple scenario in which most of the unused gas supply is driven entirely out of the galaxies by a strong wind following one major burst of star and cluster formation .",
    "if this is basically correct , then the globulars in de s quite possibly were able to form completely before the onset of such a wind , and they could conceivably have been instrumental in driving it ; at the very least , if the protoclusters were still largely gaseous , they must have been already sufficiently dense and well defined that they could survive such a catastrophic event essentially intact .",
    "at the same time , field star formation must have been truncated by the wind , before reaching what would have been a `` normal '' efficiency of @xmath444 .",
    "thus , _ the massive and dense clumps of gas which ultimately formed bound star clusters had to have collapsed more rapidly than those which produced unbound groups and associations_. this conclusion may hold quite generally  one possible interpretation being that only those gas clouds in the highest - density tail of some distribution , in any setting , are able to achieve a high cumulative sfe  and it may be related to the fact that the globular clusters in dwarfs are generally somehat bluer , and presumably more metal - poor , than the bulk of the field stars there ( durrell et al .",
    "1996 ; miller et al .",
    "1998 )    a similar feedback argument could also apply to bcgs , where it may be that especially strong early bursts of star and cluster formation led to the premature virialization of large amounts of protogalactic gas , and perhaps drove slow , _ partial _",
    "galactic winds , most effectively in the low - density environs at large galactocentric radii ( cf .",
    "harris et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the unused gas would have to remain hot to the present day , and more or less in the vicinity of the parent galaxy , in order to enter the observed @xmath94@xmath324 relation as inferred in  4.1 .",
    "this requirement is consistent with the fact that bcgs are situated at or near the centers of their galaxy clusters , and thus at the bottoms of very deep potential wells . in this scenario , again , globulars would have had to form , in just the numbers expected of them , somewhat before field stars were able to do the same ; and this truncation of unclustered star formation would have had to be more severe at large galactocentric radii ( where the feedback is strongest ) .",
    "this could then account explicitly for the connection between the first and second specific frequency problems , i.e. , between high global @xmath3 and local @xmath204 ratios that increase with @xmath86 .",
    "it also gives a more specific context to the general claim ( harris 1986 ) that the shallowness of gcs radial distributions relative to the stellar light profiles in some ellipticals resulted from the globulars having formed slightly in advance of the stars there .",
    "the main demand on this picture for bcg formation is that it must be able to explain why @xmath300 increases with galaxy luminosity , i.e. , why more massive bcgs apparently had larger fractions of their initial gas mass virialized early on . as harris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss in some detail , this issue is likely related to the fact that brighter bcgs are generally found in more massive galaxy clusters , which may have presented higher - density and more turbulent environments that led to systematically higher star formation rates , and more violent feedback . although speculative , these ideas are suggested directly by the gcs data , and are consistent with all those available . since they are also obviously related to questions on the star - formation histories of de s , on the origin of the @xmath94@xmath324 correlation in the brightest ellipticals , and on the nature of the intracluster medium , they should be addressed with considerably more rigor than has been applied here .",
    "it is particularly striking that the cluster formation efficiency derived in  4.3 for the milky way halo is essentially indistinguishable from that which applied in m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 , and which appears to have held quite generally in ellipticals of most any description .",
    "this calls into serious question one of the primary motivations for the model of ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) and zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) , who posit that ellipticals are formed primarily by the mergers of gas - rich spirals , and invoke preferential cluster formation during these events to account for what they claim is a typical factor of two difference in the observed ratios @xmath39 of late- and early - type systems .",
    "although it is true that spirals have specific frequencies that are lower than those in bright e galaxies , by factors of perhaps 23 on average ( as is exemplified by the milky way in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] above ; see also harris 1991 ) , it is now apparent that this is not necessarily a reflection of similar discrepancies in their more fundamental @xmath298 .",
    "if the milky way is typical , it suggests that  even though stellar clusters certainly can form in merging galaxies_mergers are not required to explain the relative gcs populations of spirals and ellipticals in general_. conversely , whenever an elliptical does form by the major merger of two spirals , this is allowed to include cluster formation only at the standard efficiency of @xmath445 .",
    "ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) and zepf & ashman ( 1993 ) also attribute the second specific frequency problem to the formation of ellipticals by mergers of spirals with pre - existing gcss . however , it is not clear that this is necessary either , if the extended spatial distribution of globulars in the brightest ellipticals is generally related to their association with hot gas at rather large galactocentric radii .",
    "in fact , a basic expectation of the original ashman - zepf scenario is that the second @xmath3 problem should be _ less _ pronounced in galaxies with higher global @xmath3 ( which they hypothesize to have suffered greater numbers of major mergers ) .",
    "the sense of this predicted trend is _ opposite _ to the one implied here  with empirical support directly from the evidence in m87 , and indirectly from the correlations of forbes et al .",

    "although radial - profile and @xmath3 data by themselves may not rule out the merger model for gcss altogether , a revision to take account of the hot gas in large ellipticals is essential if it is to be at all viable .",

    "such a change in slope is obviously not allowed by hernquist s density profile .",
    "thus , the failure of this model in this case makes the point that _ any _ of the density fits in table [ tab5 ] should be taken at face value only over the ranges of @xmath12 that have been directly observed ; extrapolations to much larger radii could potentially introduce appreciable systematic errors .",
    "table [ tab5 ] has three interesting implications : ( 1 ) none of the available data _ require _ the existence of truly constant - density `` cores '' in gcss .",
    "this was also mentioned by mclaughlin ( 1995 ) and it is , of course , plainly seen in figs .  [ fig4 ] through [ fig6 ] .",
    "evidence is emerging for a similar situation in elliptical galaxies generally ( crane et al .",
    "1993 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "1996 ) , and apparently also in galaxy clusters ( merritt & tremblay 1994 ; carlberg et al .  1997 ; mclaughlin 1999 ) .",
    "( 2 ) it has been suggested , particularly in the contexts of some dynamical analyses ( e.g. , huchra & brodie 1987 ; weil , bland - hawthorn , & malin 1997 ) that the m87 gcs directly reflects the distribution of dark matter in and around that galaxy . however , this is not true in any simple sense ; neither of the @xmath179 fits given in table [ tab5 ] provides an adequate description of @xmath455 in m87 . instead , it is found there that @xmath456 ( see mclaughlin 1999 ) , in which case fig .  [ fig4 ] shows that the gcs becomes a reliable tracer of the dark matter halo _ alone _ only on fairly large spatial scales ( where the number densities become quite low ) .",
    "( 3 ) the analytical fits to @xmath121 and @xmath179 offer a convenient way to extrapolate the observed densities to ( slightly ) smaller and larger radii than those observed , so as to compute the total gcs populations of these three galaxies .",
    "thus , in m87 , it is found that @xmath457 clusters ( over all magnitudes ) are _ projected _ to distances @xmath458 kpc from the galaxy s center ; in m49 , there are @xmath459 globulars within the same projected @xmath86 ; and in ngc 1399 , @xmath222 clusters have @xmath460 kpc .",
    "these total `` projected populations '' are in good agreement with those estimated in many other studies ( see the references cited in  3 ) .",
    "however , it is now possible to determine the three - dimensional radius of the sphere which actually contains all of these clusters in each system . from either of the m87",
    "fits in table [ tab5 ] , it is found that 13600 clusters are contained within @xmath461160 kpc ; in m49 , 6850 globulars come from the sphere @xmath462150 kpc ; and the 4700 globulars in ngc 1399 all have true galactocentric positions @xmath46395 kpc . to put this another way ,",
    "all three gcss are sufficiently centrally concentrated that , in each case , some 85%90% of the globular clusters projected onto the galaxy  so again , to within @xmath464 kpc for m87 and m49 , and @xmath465 kpc for ngc 1399really are located at those galactocentric distances in three dimensions .",
    "this last point specifically can clarify and constrain the suggestion ( white 1987 ; west et al .",
    "1995 ; ct et al .",
    "1998 ) that the high specific frequencies in bcgs like m87 are due to the `` contamination '' of their gcss , in projection , by a significant number of globular clusters that are associated with a galaxy cluster as a whole , rather than bound to the central galaxy itself .",
    "harris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tried to test this idea in some detail for m87 in particular , working from the assumption ( following white 1987 ) that any population of intergalactic globular clusters ( igcs ) should generally be associated with the diffuse stellar light of the cd envelopes that surround many bcgs ( i.e. , these structures were considered to comprise primarily intracluster stars ) .",
    "this hypothesis leads to inconsistencies that prompted harris et al .  to reject igcs as the main cause of the first specific frequency problem .",
    "while their arguments still stand within the framework that they constructed , it is now seen that the high @xmath3 of m87 certainly , and likely those of other bcgs as well , can be traced to subsets of their gcss that are associated with hot gas , and not necessarily with stars at all .",
    "this does appear to favor the basic notion of igcs , since the gas around m87 extends to very large spatial scales , and traces out the potential well of the virgo cluster as a whole ( mclaughlin 1999 ) .",
    "if a constant @xmath80 holds all the way out , then , a cluster - wide population of globulars could be expected .",
    "however , since _ all _ of the 13600 globular clusters which give m87 its high specific frequency in projection are physically associated with a volume of radius @xmath18150 kpc around the galaxy , it is not obvious that any of them are truly `` intergalactic '' objects at the current epoch .",
    "projection effects are _ not _ solely responsible for the high @xmath3 of m87 , and although intergalactic globular clusters may well exist , it is not clear that any have yet been observed .    of course , since m87 is at the dynamical center of virgo , it can be difficult to distinguish meaningfully between the galaxy and the cluster on 100-kpc scales . in the context of igcs",
    ", the question evidently comes down to one of origin : did the globulars now seen right around m87 actually form there , or were many of them somehow brought in from much further than 150 kpc away ?",
    "any self - consistent answer to this must be able to account for the observed fact that @xmath466 at galactocentric radii @xmath467100 kpc in m87 ; that is , both the very existence and the normalization of this proportionality have to be explained .",
    "although essentially any scenario which is able to do this would be allowed by the current data , none could be _ preferred _ over what remains the simplest option : that the bulk of the m87 gcs formed in situ , with a thoroughly standard and spatially constant @xmath4 . ultimately , only detailed evolutionary models , tailored specifically to the properties of m87 and virgo and considering both stars _ and gas _ , can really decide what fraction of the galaxy s gcs might have come originally from the cluster at large .",
    "stars form mainly in groups , some of which emerge from their natal clouds of gas as gravitationally bound clusters .",
    "an understanding of cluster formation will therefore be integral to any full theory of star formation , and an important element of this is simply the frequency with which it occurs .",
    "that is , what is the likelihood that a star - forming cloud of gas  whether this be a dense clump in a galactic giant molecular cloud , or a larger one in a protogalactic fragment  will achieve the high cumulative star formation efficiency ( viz .",
    "@xmath43950% ) that allows its stars to remain bound as a cluster after they have cleared away the gas ?",
    "this paper has used observations of the globular cluster systems in galaxy halos to address this question , and to empirically evaluate the efficiency of cluster formation : by mass , @xmath468% .",
    "this is , by all appearances , nearly a universal number , and it should therefore serve as a strong constraint on theories of star and cluster formation in any context .    to arrive at this result ,",
    "it was first shown (  2.1 ) that the total ( global ) _ masses _ of gcss are quite robust , even over a hubble time , against the dynamical processes that work to destroy low - mass globular clusters in the central regions of galaxies . with an observed @xmath36 thus useful as a measure of the initial quantity ,",
    "the specific frequencies of gcss , @xmath469 , serve as _ crude _",
    "first estimates of the basic formation efficiency @xmath1 . to the _",
    "limited _ extent that @xmath30 is an adequate description of early - type galaxies , the implication is that @xmath470 .",
    "the limiting factor in this simplest treatment of gcs data is the assumption that a galaxy s current stellar mass always suffices as an estimate of its total initial gas mass ; if taken too far , this quickly leads to some perplexing conclusions .",
    "as was reviewed in  2.2 , systematic variations in @xmath3 exist along the entire sequence of early - type galaxies , from dwarf ellipticals ( where @xmath471 or so ) through normal giants ( @xmath472 ) and on to the brightest ellipticals , including many of the central galaxies in groups and rich clusters ( @xmath473 ) .",
    "if specific frequency were indeed a good estimator of @xmath4 in general , the implication would seem to be that this also varied , for unknown reasons and in a non - monotonic fashion , as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "closely related to this is the fact that the gcss of some , but not all , large ellipticals are spatially more extended than their stellar halos",
    ". that is , local @xmath3 values increase with projected @xmath86 in some systems , which naively would suggest that  again , for unknown reasons , and counter to any intuition  the efficiency of cluster formation _ sometimes _ increased with galactocentric radius .",
    "an important clue to the true nature of both these `` specific frequency problems''which are most likely two aspects of a single phenomenon  lies in the observation that the global @xmath3 in central cluster galaxies increases with the x - ray luminosity of their parent clusters .",
    "some of the globulars in these systems ought then to be associated with the hot gas there ; and @xmath474 is approximated better by the present - day @xmath475 than by @xmath38 alone .",
    "@xmath3 then systematically overestimates the true cluster formation efficiency @xmath4 , which instead is given empirically by @xmath476 .",
    "in addition , since a galaxy s hot gas generally follows a shallower density profile than its stellar halo does , the `` extra '' clusters in very gas - rich ( and high-@xmath3 ) ellipticals might well be expected to also show a radial distribution , @xmath178 or @xmath111 , that is distended relative to @xmath239 or @xmath192 .",
    "these ideas , which extend similar suggestions in the recent literature , have been tested in detail for each of m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 .",
    "data were collected from the literature on the gcss , surface brightness profiles , and x - ray gas densities of these galaxies , covering spatial scales @xmath477100 kpc . in ",
    "3.1 , new comparisons of the projected densities @xmath111 and @xmath192 in m49 and ngc 1399 ( which are gas - poor ) showed that , contrary to previous claims , neither galaxy suffers from either of the two specific frequency problems : the global @xmath3 of m49 has a `` standard '' value of @xmath105 , and the local ratio @xmath204 is constant with radius ( outside of a `` core '' region , @xmath478 , that possibly has been dynamically depleted ) if the recent surface - brightness profile of caon et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is used in the comparison rather than the older @xmath187 measurements of king ( 1978 ) .",
    "the global specific frequency of ngc 1399 is similarly `` average '' , @xmath479 , if its gcs population is normalized to an absolute magnitude for the galaxy ( @xmath220 ) that is significantly brighter than the value more commonly adopted .",
    "the ratio @xmath480 is also constant with radius in this galaxy , and has a value equal to that found in m49 .",
    "m87 , at the center of the virgo cluster , is much richer in gas than either of m49 or ngc 1399 , and both @xmath3 problems are in evidence there . a discrete , geometrical deprojection algorithm was developed to enable a direct comparison between the volume densities @xmath178 , @xmath239 , and @xmath255 at all three - dimensional galactocentric radii in m87 .",
    "it was found in  3.2 that @xmath481 , beyond @xmath482 kpc , and that the constant of proportionality is the same as that in m49 and ngc 1399 . _",
    "the cluster formation efficiency was constant with galactocentric radius inside each of these systems , and the same from one galaxy to another_. specifically , @xmath483 ( observed departures from this ratio in the central regions @xmath484 of m87 and m49 may have resulted , at least in part , from the dynamical destruction of globular clusters there . ) many globulars in m87 are indeed associated with its x - ray gas , and this is in fact responsible for the appearance of both specific frequency problems .",
    "this single case leads to the basic expectation  which should be tested in as many individual systems as possible  that real discrepancies between @xmath111 and @xmath485 should appear only in gas - rich ellipticals that also have high global specific fequencies .",
    "the obvious generalization of these results is that most galaxies might have been subject to a single , common @xmath4 .",
    "this possibility was explored , and borne out , in  4 .",
    "observations of global @xmath3 ( i.e. , total gcs populations and galaxy luminosities ) in 97 giant ellipticals , brightest cluster galaxies , and dwarf ellipticals _ all _ were shown to be consistent with the predictions of a universal @xmath4 at the same level as that observed directly in m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 .",
    "the different scalings of @xmath3 with @xmath9 among normal giant ellipticals , central cluster galaxies , and dwarfs stem entirely from fundamentally different relations between @xmath9 and @xmath5 in these different physical regimes .",
    "these relations have been obtained from scaling arguments that employ the optical fundamental plane of bright ellipticals ; the observed correlation between x - ray and optical luminosities in early - type systems ; and the fractional gas loss expected in a specific model ( dekel & silk 1986 ) for winds from a single burst of star formation in dark - matter dominated dwarf ellipticals .",
    "observations of @xmath22 vs.  @xmath347 still show some _ scatter _ about the mean prediction of constant @xmath4 , and it will be important to clarify the significance and the origins of this . however , there are no _ systematic _ deviations from a universal cluster formation efficiency , in galaxies that span four orders of magnitude in total luminosity and gcs population .",
    "exactly the same @xmath4 was shown , in  4 , to have obtained for globular clusters in the spheroid , or stellar halo , of the milky way ; and it was argued that it appears also to apply now , to the formation of _ open _ clusters locally in the galactic disk .",
    "this remarkable robustness , in which a single cluster formation efficiency was and is realized in a great variety of local and global environments , demands a very general theoretical explanation . from a more empirical standpoint ,",
    "it bears directly on current questions involving gcs and galaxy formation and evolution on large scales .",
    "some of these were discussed in  5 .",
    "of considerable interest is the fact that , with @xmath4 constant but @xmath39 not , the efficiency of _ unclustered _ star formation could _ not _ have been universal ; field star formation must have been suppressed , in a sense , in dwarf ellipticals and at large galactocentric radii in the brightest , most gas - rich ellipticals .",
    "the possibility that these points could be understood in terms of feedback processes seems promising (  5 ) , and should be explored in quantitative models .",

    "<S> the specific frequencies of globular cluster systems , @xmath0 , are discussed in terms of their connection to the efficiency of globular cluster formation in galaxy halos , which is claimed to reflect a generic aspect of the star formation process as it operates even at the current epoch . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the total _ </S>",
    "<S> masses _ of gcss are little affected by the dynamical destruction of low - mass clusters at small galactocentric radii . </S>",
    "<S> this permits direct , empirical estimates of the cluster formation efficiency by mass , @xmath1 , even after @xmath2 years of gcs evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the standard practice of using only the stellar luminosities of galaxies as indicators of their initial total gas masses ( and thus relating @xmath3 to @xmath4 in one step ) leads to serious conceptual problems , that are reviewed here . the _ first specific frequency problem _ , which is the well known tendency for many brightest cluster galaxies to have higher than average @xmath3 , is a global one ; the _ second specific frequency problem _ is a local one , in which the more extended spatial distribution of gcss relative to halo stars in some ( not all ) bright ellipticals leads to @xmath3 values that increase with radius inside the galaxies . extending similar suggestions in the recent literature </S>",
    "<S> , it is argued that these trends in @xmath3 do not reflect any such behavior in the underlying @xmath4 ; rather , _ both _ of these problems stem from neglecting the hot , x - ray emitting gas in and around many large ellipticals , and both may be alleviated by including this component in estimates of @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> this claim is checked and confirmed in each of m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 , all of which have been thought to suffer from one or the other of these @xmath3 problems . </S>",
    "<S> existing data are combined to construct gcs surface density profiles that extend over nearly the whole extents of these three galaxies , and a non - parametric , geometrical deprojection algorithm is developed to afford a direct comparison between the _ volume _ density profiles of their gcss , stars , and gas . </S>",
    "<S> it is found , in each case , that @xmath6 at radii beyond roughly a stellar effective radius , inside of which dynamical evolution may have depeleted the initial gcss . </S>",
    "<S> the constant of proportionality is the same in all three galaxies : @xmath7 . taken together , these results suggest that gcss generally should be more spatially extended than stellar halos only in gas - rich galaxies that also have a high global specific frequency .    the implication that @xmath4 might have had a universal value is supported by global gcs data for a sample of 97 giant ellipticals , brightest cluster galaxies , and faint dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the total globular cluster populations in all of these early - type systems are in excellent agreement with the predictions of a constant @xmath4 at the level observed directly in m87 , m49 , and ngc 1399 ; all _ systematic _ variations in gcs specific frequency between galaxies are shown to result entirely from different relations , in different magnitude ranges , between @xmath8 and the present - day @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> an identical @xmath4 is also calculated for the pop .  </S>",
    "<S> ii spheroid of the milky way , and is indicated ( although less conclusively ) for the ongoing formation of open clusters . the inferred universal cluster formation efficiency , of @xmath100.25% by mass , should serve as a strong constraint on general theories of star and cluster formation . </S>",
    "<S> the associated inference of a non - universal formation efficiency for unclustered stars is considered , particularly in terms of the suggestion that this might result , both in dwarf galaxies and at large galactocentric radii in the brightest ellipticals , from feedback and galactic winds . </S>",
    "<S> implications for a merger - formation model of early - type gcss , and for the proposed existence of intergalactic globulars in clusters of galaxies , are briefly discussed . </S>"
