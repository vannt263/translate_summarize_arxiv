    "the stability of the flow of a newtonian fluid such as water through a straight pipe of constant circular cross - section has fascinated scientists ever since reynolds ( 1883 ) original experiments .",
    "reynolds realised that there was a single non - dimensional control parameter for the flow , @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the mean velocity , @xmath2 is the pipe diameter , and @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ) , but that there was no unique value of this parameter for transition to occur .",
    "instead , he noticed that the value of @xmath4 required for transition depended critically on how cleanly he performed the experiment , that is , on the ambient level of noise . later theoretical and computational work confirmed that the steady , unidirectional , parabolic , laminar ` hagen - poiseuille ' flow ( hagen 1839 , poiseuille 1840 )",
    "realised at low @xmath4 is linearly stable at least to @xmath5 ( meseguer & trefethen 2003 ) and that pipe flow transition must be a finite - amplitude process .",
    "the variability in the critical @xmath4 across experimental realisations has indicated that this process is also sensitive to the exact form of disturbances present in the flow ( e.g. peixinho & mullin 2007 ) .",
    "once triggered , transition is generally abrupt and can lead to both localised and global forms of turbulence depending on @xmath4 . for @xmath6",
    ", turbulence is localised into ` puffs ' ( wygnanski & champagne 1973 ) which have a weak front , a sharp trailing edge , and maintain their length at about @xmath7 as they propagate along the pipe .",
    "for @xmath8 , the turbulence delocalises into ` slug ' turbulence ( wygnanski _ et al _ 1975 ) which has sharp front travelling faster than the mean flow and a trailing edge travelling slower so that it expands while propagating downstream . as a result of this varied behaviour and the sensitivity of the transition process",
    ", pipe flow has become _ the _ canonical example of shear flow transition .    from a dynamical systems viewpoint",
    ", the existence of turbulence requires the presence of simpler solutions of the governing equations to provide a framework in state space to sustain turbulent trajectories from simply relaminarising .",
    "natural questions are then whether the emergence of such alternative solutions can be used to predict the threshold ( lowest ) @xmath4 for transition and what role they play in the process as well as the final turbulent state .",
    "steady states and travelling waves ( tws ) - fixed points in an appropriately chosen galilean frame - are the simplest solutions .",
    "the first step towards identifying such states was taken by smith & bodonyi ( @xmath9 ) who predicted the existence of helical modes ( with swirl ) through a critical layer analysis .",
    "landman ( @xmath10 ) , however , failed to find any numerical evidence for their existence .",
    "in the same year , nagata ( 1990 ) used a homotopy approach to find finite amplitude solutions in plane couette flow starting from the linearly - unstable rotating situation . a similar attempt using rotating pipe flow , however , failed to reach the vanishing rotation limit ( barnes & kerswell @xmath11 ) . by this time",
    "a more systematic approach was emerging based upon the idea of a self - sustaining process .",
    "( @xmath12 ) suggested that streamwise rolls could create streamwise streaks which in turn could reinforce the original rolls by some unspecified non - linear process .",
    "waleffe ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) closed the loop by showing that the streaks had inflectional instabilities which led to what he described as ` wriggling ' in such a manner that energy is fed back into the initial rolls .",
    "he then identified such solutions in plane - couette flow using a constructive homotopic approach .",
    "faisst & eckhardt ( @xmath15 ) and wedin & kerswell ( @xmath16 ) employed this technique within the geometry of pipe flow to find the expected travelling waves although all were without swirl and therefore unrelated to the predictions of smith & bodonyi ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "experimental observations ( hof et al .",
    "2004,2005 ) and numerical computations ( kerswell & tutty 2007 , schneider et al .",
    "2007a , willis & kerswell 2008 ) then followed which indicated that these waves are realised albeit transiently as coherent structures in turbulent pipe flow .",
    "these waves are all born in saddle node bifurcations with the lowest at @xmath17 for tws with a discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "pringle & kerswell ( @xmath18 ) substantially lowered this to @xmath19 by finding travelling waves with no rotational symmetry .",
    "the @xmath4 gap between when alternative solutions exist and when sustained turbulence occurs is then certainly positive but also too large to be a useful predictor .",
    "recently duguet et al ( 2008a ) have adopted an entirely different approach to finding tws based upon identifying episodes in time - dependent pipe flow which exhibit temporal periodicity . to generate a long time signal for this search , sustained flow dynamics away from the laminar state",
    "is required .",
    "the obvious source for this is studying flow on the turbulent attractor but they realised that there was a more promising alternative where the flow is less energetic and periodic episodes are more clearly evident : the laminar - turbulent boundary .",
    "this is the set of flows which separates initial conditions which immediately relaminarise from those which undergo a turbulent episode .",
    "an initial condition chosen on this boundary or ` edge ' ( skufca et al .",
    "2006 ) will evolve in time forever treading a tight rope between relaminarising and becoming turbulent ( toh & itano 1999 , itano & toh 2001 , schneider et al 2007b ) .",
    "duguet et al ( 2008a ) identified 3 new tws by using velocity fields from near - time periodic episodes in this energetically intermediate flow dynamics as starting guesses for an iterative newton - krylov solver .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show how the tws found by duguet et al ( 2008a ) led to the discovery of 2 new _ classes _ of mirror - symmetric tws hereafter referred to as the m- and n - classes , and a distinctly new family of mirror - symmetric tws .",
    "each class is partitioned by the discrete rotational symmetry ( see ( [ r ] ) below ) enjoyed by the waves which defines a _ family _ within the class .",
    "this suggests a natural labelling system where , for example , the family of m - class tws with @xmath20 ( integer ) degree of discrete rotational symmetry will be referred to as the m@xmath20 family .",
    "we argue that the mirror - symmetric wave of pringle & kerswell ( 2007 ) is actually part of the first family ( m1 ) of the m - class and ` a3 ' in the nomenclature of duguet et al ( 2008a ) is a member of the second family ( m2 ) .",
    "we further report the families m3 , m4 , m5 and m6 which , unlike anything seen so far , all have a double layer structure of fast and slow streaks across the pipe radius .",
    "the second n - class of tws has ` c3 ' in duguet et al ( 2008a ) as part of its second family ( n2 ) with the families n3 , n4 and n5 described here for the first time . in these waves ,",
    "the fast streaks are positioned near the pipe wall and slow streaks in the interior , a separation familiar from the original non - mirror symmetric tws found by faisst & eckhardt ( 2003 ) and wedin & kerswell ( 2004 ) .",
    "since these waves only have shift-&-reflect symmetry - see ( [ s ] ) below - we refer to this original set as the s - class hereafter for convenience .",
    "the plan of the paper is to start by discussing the various symmetries of the tws which serve to categorize them in section 2 . beyond these",
    ", all the tws are parametrised by their axial wavenumber @xmath21 which is a continuous variable with a finite range at a given @xmath4 .",
    "these waves are exact solutions of the navier - stokes equations when periodic flow conditions are imposed across the pipe with a spatial period equal to an integer multiple of @xmath22 .",
    "the 3 tws found recently by duguet et al ( 2008a ) are then introduced in section 3 .",
    "numerical codes developed in wedin & kerswell ( 2004 ) are used to explore these waves in parameter space . a new classification",
    "is then introduced in section 4 stimulated by the discoveries of related families .",
    "a final discussion follows in section 5 .",
    "the original work by faisst & eckhardt ( 2003 ) and wedin & kerswell ( 2004 ) used the homotopy approach developed by waleffe ( 1997 ) to look for exact steady solutions in an appropriately chosen galilean frame . in this",
    ", an artificial body forcing is added to the navier - stokes equations in order to drive streamwise rolls .",
    "these advect the underlying shear towards and away from the pipe wall , thereby generating positive and negative streamwise anomalies in the mean flow called ` streaks ' .",
    "if these streaks are of sufficient amplitude they become inflexionally unstable to streamwise - dependent flows which if allowed to grow to sufficient amplitude can replace the artificial forcing as the energy source for the rolls . by choosing the forcing functions to have certain discrete rotational symmetries defined by @xmath23 and selecting streamwise - dependent instabilities having the shift-&-reflect symmetry @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the wavelength ,",
    "exact tws were found by continuing back to zero forcing in @xmath26 and @xmath27 discrete rotational symmetry subspaces .",
    "all appear through saddle node bifurcations with the lowest at @xmath17 corresponding to a @xmath28 symmetric tw .",
    "each tw family is parameterised by its axial wavenumber @xmath21 which , at a given @xmath4 , has a finite range ( e.g see figures 1 & 2 of kerswell & tutty 2007 ) .",
    "later , motivated by a chaotic flow state found on the laminar - turbulent boundary by schneider et al ( 2007b ) , pringle and kerswell ( 2007 ) generalised the forcing function to have no rotational symmetry ( see also mellibovsky & meseguer 2007 ) . as a result , they found an asymmetric tw ( formally the missing @xmath29 state possessing one pair of streamwise rolls ) with @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "this tw originates through a symmetry - breaking bifurcation from a state which satisfies the additional shift-&-rotate symmetry @xmath31 with @xmath32 and is therefore mirror - symmetric about @xmath33 ( the plane @xmath34 being set by the shift-&-reflect symmetry ) . for general @xmath20 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 implies @xmath37",
    "is applied @xmath38 times and @xmath39 represents reflection in the plane @xmath40 .",
    "helical generalisations , which satisfy a modified shift-&-rotate symmetry @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the helicity , pringle & kerswell 2007 ) but no @xmath30-symmetry , were also found but always at higher @xmath4 indicating that the flow prefers the streaks to be aligned with the flow rather than twisted around it .",
    "( 11.5,11.5 ) ( 0.0,0.0 )",
    "the new tws discovered by duguet et al ( 2008a ) were found by studying the flow dynamics on the laminar - turbulent boundary _ within _ the @xmath43-symmetric subspace .",
    "surprisingly , at @xmath44 and periodic pipe length @xmath45 , the rotationally - unrestricted situation only ever revealed the already - known asymmetric tw ( pringle & kerswell 2007 ) and a weakly rotating version of it ( a@xmath46 in duguet et al 2008a ) .",
    "the fact that new @xmath43-symmetric tws were observed as transient coherent structures only in the @xmath43-symmetric subspace calculations is due to the reduced number of unstable directions they have as non @xmath43-symmetric flows are removed from the dynamics .",
    "the chance of the flow ` visiting ' a tw in phase space is presumably related to how unstable it is ( the spatial periodicity of the flow was also shortened to improve the stability of the tws ) . in the notation of duguet",
    "et al ( 2008a ) the 3 new tws were labelled as ` a3 ' , ` c3 ' and ` d2 ' and all are mirror symmetric even though this symmetry was not imposed on the flow .",
    "a3 and c3 were readily converged in the continuation codes of wedin & kerswell ( 2004 ) but d2 could not be , due , we suspect , to insufficient axial resolution being achievable in the continuation code .",
    "the roll structure of d2 was , however , used to design a forcing in the homotopy approach which successfully yielded a similar - looking tw - called z2 - with the same symmetries as d2 .",
    "that they were , in fact , different waves became apparent when z2 could not be continued below @xmath47 whereas d2 was discovered at @xmath44 .",
    "the structure of a3 , c3 and z2 is shown in figure [ fig : slices ] compared to a known tw in s2 , which , at @xmath48 and @xmath49 is already known to be on the laminar - turbulent boundary ( this is @xmath50 in the nomenclature of kerswell & tutty 2007 ) .",
    "while all the new families possess the apparently universal features of exact coherent structures known in wall - bounded shear flows - wavy streaks with staggered quasistreamwise vortices ( nagata 1990 , waleffe 1998 , 2001 , 2003 , faisst & eckhardt 2003 , wedin & kerswell 2004 , pringle & kerswell 2007 ) , there are new structural features .",
    "a3 has a strikingly different cross - sectional profile from previously known tws ( e.g. s2 ) in that _ both _ fast and slow streaks are concentrated at the pipe wall leaving the interior relatively quiescent .",
    "figure [ fig : slices ] shows that c3 and z2 are also noticably different too .",
    "however , it is the axial structure of z2 which really makes it stand out .",
    "z2 is not @xmath30-symmetric nor @xmath51-symmetric but _ does _ have mirror symmetry about two perpendicular planes .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the flow to prefer one of these symmetries over any of the others , but to date all tws in _ any _ of the canonical shear flows have always been ",
    "-symmetric ( except , trivially , the helical modes of pk07 ; waleffe , private communication ) .",
    "therefore z2 and d2 are the first tws found to possess only -symmetry ( @xmath52 with @xmath53 suppressed as there is no longer an origin for @xmath54 ) .",
    "both z2 and d2 are , however , close to being @xmath30-symmetric in the sense that the simple indicator @xmath55    in contrast , a3 and c3 are both @xmath30- and @xmath56-symmetric and hence also reflectionally symmetric about a plane at @xmath57 to the plane of shift-&-reflect symmetry ( horizontal in figure [ fig : slices ] ) i.e. they have @xmath58 symmetry .",
    "the modes c3 and a3 appear through saddle node bifurcations at @xmath59 and @xmath60 with optimal wavenumbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively giving these lowest saddle node bifurcations : see table 1 .",
    "( 13.02,11.1 ) ( 0,0 )      an interesting feature of all tws found so far is that they are unstable but only with an unstable manifold of very small dimension ( invariably less than 10 for those checked so far - faisst & eckhardt 2003 , kerswell & tutty 2007 ) .",
    "the typical situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : stab ] which displays the spectrum of the c3 wave at the wavenumber @xmath63 which gives its lowest saddle node bifurcation . while @xmath4 is double - valued near the bifurcation",
    ", the phase speed @xmath64 is not , monotonically decreasing in value as the bifurcation point is crossed from lower to upper branch .",
    "this then provides a convenient abscissa to show how the stability changes on both upper and lower branches as @xmath4 increases away from the saddle node bifurcation .",
    "only disturbances which share the @xmath43-symmetry of c3 are considered .",
    "c3 is particularly interesting for two reasons : 1 ) the number of unstable directions decreases down to one for @xmath65 along the lower branch and 2 ) there are several bifurcations involving real eigenvalues .",
    "the implication of the first observation is that c3 , which is on the laminar - turbulent boundary ( in a pipe 2.5d long at @xmath49 , duguet et al 2008a ) , will become a local attractor there beyond @xmath66 for @xmath43-symmetric flow ( confirmed by duguet et al .",
    "the second observation means that new solutions bifurcate from c3 which are also steady in an appropriately translating galilean frame - that is to say they are travelling waves ( this is how the asymmetric travelling wave of pringle & kerswell @xmath18 appears ) .",
    "there are 4 possibilities : a transcritical bifurcation where no symmetry is broken , and 3 types of symmetry - breaking pitchfork in which only @xmath30- , @xmath67- or @xmath56-symmetry is retained ( recall 2 symmetries imply the third ) .",
    "for example , the bifurcation at @xmath68 is a mirror - symmetry - breaking pitchfork which can be followed to produce tws which resemble those of s2 .",
    "d2 is plausibly the product of a @xmath30-symmetry - breaking pitchfork from c3 ( d2 is very similar to z2 and hence c3 - see figure [ fig : slices ] ) .",
    "hopf bifurcations are the generic scenario , however , leading to more complicated , relative periodic orbits such as that traced by duguet _",
    "( @xmath69 ) . within the @xmath4 range of figure [ fig :",
    "stab ] , c3 experiences 3 hopf bifurcations which all lead to relative periodic orbits with the @xmath67-symmetry broken .",
    ".the various symetries of all the tws currently known .",
    "fe04 is faisst & eckhardt ( 2003 ) , wk04 is wedin & kerswell ( 2004 ) and pk07 is pringle & kerswell ( 2007 )",
    ". the ? mark in the entry for wk04 is to indicate that they found a mirror - symmetric tw but at high @xmath4 and its relationship to m1 is unclear .",

    "the fact that a3 and c3 appear at such low @xmath4 strongly suggests that there are analogous waves in different rotational symmetry classes also existent at pre- and transitional @xmath70 .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case with all except one ( m3 ) of the new families of mirror - symmetric modes being easily found using the homotopy approach once the appropriate @xmath51-symmetry is incorporated . selecting a roll forcing of @xmath71-symmetry defined , in",
    "the notation of wedin & kerswell ( @xmath16 ) , by @xmath72 with @xmath73 or @xmath74 invariably led to a subharmonic @xmath75-symmetric streak instability which could be easily tracked back to zero forcing ( this was exactly the strategy used by wedin & kerswell to find their @xmath29 tw which has two roll pairs and appears beyond @xmath76 ) .",
    "the remaining wave m3 was found by homotopy in @xmath20 starting at a m5 wave ( m5 being used rather than m4 because of the similar parity of velocity components with respect to the radius ) .",
    "inspection of the new lower branch tws - see figures [ m ] and [ n]cp1571/tws / table.htm ] - indicates that the mirror - symmetric family reported in pringle & kerswell ( 2007 ) is the first family ( m1 ) and a3 is a member of the second family ( m2 ) of a class of tws ( m@xmath20 with @xmath20=2,3,4,5,6 ,  ) with two layers of fast and slow streaks .",
    "furthermore , c3 appears a member of a @xmath43-symmetric family ( n2 ) of another class of tws ( n@xmath20 with @xmath20=2,3,4,5 ,  ) .",
    "the ordering of the families within the respective classes is clear from the phase speed and wavenumber data shown in figure [ calpha ] .",
    "extending the m@xmath20 and n@xmath20 families to higher rotational symmetry @xmath20 is straightforward and could have been continued if the general trend had not already emerged .",
    "finding lower families is , however , more difficult with n1 noticeably absent at the time of writing",
    ". this family could potentially be the first to appear as @xmath4 increases from zero but this seems less likely after plotting the optimal slices of each family s solution surface together on a phase speed verses @xmath4 plot ( ` optimal ' being defined by that wavenumber @xmath63 which corresponds to the lowest saddle node bifurcation ) .",
    "whereas the bifurcation points for m@xmath20 tws monotonically increase in @xmath4 and decrease in @xmath64 with @xmath20 ( see figure [ cre ] ) , this is not true for the n - class .",
    "of n2 to n5 , n3 actually has the lowest bifurcation point .",
    "this mimics the situation for the original s - class ( non - mirror symmetric ) tws .",
    "the fact that the lowest @xmath4 for each n@xmath20 family as well as m1 and m2 is consistently smaller than the lowest @xmath4 for the equivalent s@xmath20 family is suggestive that the latter all bifurcate off the former in mirror - symmetry - breaking bifurcations .",
    "this , after all , is the situation for the asymmetric waves reported in pringle & kerswell ( 2007 ) which form the missing ( trivially ) @xmath29-symmetric family from the original studies and which bifurcate off the m1 family . for a given @xmath77 , a tw needs at least 2 quantities such as the the phase speed @xmath64 and a reynolds number , @xmath78 , measuring the wall shear stress to characterise it . examining n3 and s3",
    "tws shows that they occur in similar parts of @xmath79 space at @xmath80 ( @xmath63 for s3 ) but there is no obvious connection between them at least for @xmath81 .",
    "the implication then is , if s3 does bifurcation off n3 , the solutions exist to significantly subcritical @xmath4 which would explain why the importance of mirror - symmetric tws had nt been realised before .",
    "( 11.85,8.88 ) ( 0,0 )    the new upper branch tw solutions - see figure [ upper ] - all show an expected intensification of the slow and fast streaks , and the positioning of the fast streaks closer to the pipe wall than the corresponding lower branch solutions .",
    "this localisation is particularly noticeable for the n - class tws indicating high wall shear stresses which is borne out by figure [ fig : fric ] .",
    "the friction factors achieved by the upper branch and even by some of the lower branch n - class tws as well as m1 and m2 are significantly higher than time - averaged experimental values ( as shown by the upper dotted line ) and those of the s - class tws .    finally , it s worth remarking that the m - class tws start to appear at fascinatingly low @xmath4 given their intricate double radial layer structure : for example , m4 appears at @xmath82 ( see figure [ cre ] and table 1 ) . that they exist at all is not a surprise ( presumably tws with three radial layers are possible too ) , but that they appear so early in @xmath4 surely is and contrasts starkly with z2 which does nt emerge until @xmath83",
    "in this paper we have described 2 new classes of mirror - symmetric tws - the m- and n - classes which are also both shift-&-reflect symmetric - and a new mirror - symmetric family z2 which is not .",
    "the m- and n - class waves appear earlier in @xmath4 than the original non - mirror - symmetric waves of faisst & eckhart ( 2003 ) and wedin & kerswell ( 2004 ) suggesting that the latter are borne through generally supercritical symmetry - breaking bifurcations from them .",
    "this was already found to be the case for the m1 waves ( pringle & kerswell 2007 ) but now seems more generally true now that the various tw families making up each class have been found .",
    "the stability analysis of n2 presented here provides a timely reminder of the bifurcation possibilities : @xmath30 or @xmath67 symmetries can be broken at pitchfork bifurcations leading to either z - class tws or @xmath84-class tws found originally ( faisst & eckhardt 2003 , wedin & kerswell 2004 ) .",
    "hopf bifurcations , of course , give rise to periodic orbits in the galilean frame of the tw or quasiperiodic orbits in the pipe ( laboratory ) frame . tracing these",
    "requires a more sophisticated approach based upon time - stepping the equations and searching for an exact return of an appropriately chosen poincar map ( viswanath 2007,2008 , duguet et al 2008b ) .",
    "the original motivation for searching for all the new tws discussed here was the discovery of previously - unknown tws in the laminar - turbulent boundary by duguet et al ( 2008a ) .",
    "it is likely that some of the lower branch solutions of these new waves similarly populate this boundary so that their stable manifolds also play a role in determining if a given initial condition will lead to relaminarisation or a turbulent evolution .",
    "there are , however , many interesting issues surrounding this assumption . for example , if a lower branch tw is on the boundary at one @xmath4 , will it still be at @xmath85 and if not , how did it leave ? in a long pipe where the tws are continuously parametrised by their wavenumber over a finite range , at what critical wavenumber does the lower branch tw leave the boundary on its way to becoming an upper branch tw ? the asymmetric wave ( pringle & kerswell 2007 ) provides an obvious example being on the boundary for @xmath86 ( at @xmath44 , schneider et al 2007b , duguet et al 2008a ) but presumably not for @xmath87 where its wall shear stress is high ( see figure 6 of pringle & kerswell 2007 ) . hopefully these issues will be discussed elsewhere in this celebratory volume .    the discovery that the upper branch solutions of the new n - class waves have such high wall shear stresses is , however , potentially more important .",
    "a recent attempt to extract coherent fast - streak structures from pipe turbulence ( willis & kerswell 2008 ) has concluded that the tws currently known were not energetic enough to be part of the turbulent attractor as previously supposed and speculated about others as - yet - undiscovered . the new n - class of mirror - symmetric tws may well be these missing waves and the issue clearly needs to be revisited .    in this report , we hope a step forward has been made in appreciating the hierarchy of tws which exist in pipe flow . generally the picture is that tws with shift-&-reflect symmetry , mirror - symmetry and a low degree of rotational symmetry seem to appear first and spawn further , less symmetric , tws through bifurcations as @xmath4 increases .",
    "however , given the notorious complexity of the navier - stokes equations , it would be foolhardy to be too rigid about this especially as the n1 family still remains ` at large ' . what should be absolutely clear , though , is that the pipe flow problem continues to fascinate and intrigue us fully 125 years after reynolds original experiments .",
