    "the landau hydrodynamic approach @xcite for multi - hadron production in hadronic / nuclear collisions appeared as a method that is alternative to the s - matrix one : the latter transforms the asymptotic hadronic states from @xmath3 to @xmath4 while the former deals with the space - time evolution of thermal matter , produced in the collisions .",
    "the evolution is described by using the local energy - momentum conservation laws and thermodynamic equation of state of the matter . unlike the s - matrix formalism",
    ", the initial state in hydrodynamic approach is associated with some concrete finite time after collision when created particles reach the locally equilibrated state and so , the initial state can be described by the minimal set of parameters . as well , because system formed is quite small , the picture of continuous medium is destroyed also at likely small finite time .",
    "since the system expands fast , the latter is not constant in configuration space but depends on the position @xmath5 of the fluid elements : @xmath6 .",
    "the set of these points @xmath7 in the minkowski space forms , therefore , the hypersurface @xmath8 corresponding to the outer boundary of the applicability of hydrodynamics .",
    "the sudden freeze - out implies that the spectra are formed just on this hyperurface where , formally , an ideal fluid transforms into an ideal gas .",
    "the particle momentum spectra then can be expressed by the well - known cooper - frye formula @xcite : @xmath9 the freeze - out hypersurface is typically associated with an isotherm . according to landau @xcite @xmath10 140 mev . in current analysis of a+a collisions",
    "the corresponding temperature is in the region @xmath11 mev and is fixed , typically , from the best fit of the spectra .",
    "any isotherm contains usually non - space - like parts , which lead to unphysical negative contributions to spectra for the particles with momenta directed inward the system , @xmath12 .",
    "there is no common phenomenological prescription , based on heaviside step functions @xmath13 , which allows one to eliminate the negative contributions to the momentum spectra when @xmath14 .",
    "the prescription , proposed in @xcite , eliminates the negative contributions in the way which preserves the number of particles in the fluid element crossing the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "therefore it takes into account that at the final stage the system is the only holder of emitted particles .",
    "another prescription @xcite ignores the particle number conservation considering decaying hadronic system rather as a star - practically unlimited reservoir of emitted photons / particles .",
    "the both prescriptions have a problem with momentum - energy conservation laws at freeze - out .",
    "but the most serious problem is the obvious conflict of the cfp with simple observation : to provide sudden transformation of the liquid to ideal gas one needs to switch suddenly cross - sections between particles from very big values to very small ones @xcite that can not happen in reality .",
    "the reason of particle liberation is another : it is the gradual change of the ratio between the rate of system expansion and the rate of collisions , so that particles should be emitted continuously . the phenomenological model of continuous emission",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; another approach is the so - called hybrid models @xcite , where kinetic evolution is matched with hydro one at the hypersurface of hadronization .",
    "the shortcomings of these models are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "but the feeling that the landau / cooper - frye sudden freeze - out does not describe the real process of continuous particle emission is predominant now .    nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was advanced an idea of duality in hydro - kinetic approach to a+a collisions : though the process of particle liberation , described by the emission function , is non - equilibrium and gradual , the observable spectra can yet be expressed by means of the cooper - frye prescription based on locally equilibrium distribution function .",
    "the conclusive step towards an analytical and numerical realization of this idea is done in ref .",
    "@xcite where hydro - kinetic approach is developed : it overcomes all above mentioned problems by considering the continuous dynamical freeze - out that is consistent with boltzmann equations and conservation laws . in what follows",
    "we stick to the mainstream of arguments developed in this paper .",
    "let us start from boltzmann equation .",
    "it has the general form : @xmath15    the expressions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are so - called ( g)ain and ( l)oss terms for the particle of species @xmath18 .",
    "typically , @xmath19 is a rate of collisions of @xmath18-th particle . below we will omit index @xmath18 ,",
    "the corresponding expression can be related then , e.g. , to pions .",
    "the probability @xmath20 for a particle to reach the point @xmath21 starting from the point @xmath22 without collisions is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 in terms of this probability , the boltzmann equation can be rewritten in the following integral form @xmath25    let us integrate the distribution ( [ integr ] ) over the space variables to represent the particle momentum density at large enough time , @xmath26 , when particles in the system stop to interact . to simplify notation",
    "let us introduce the escape probability for the particle with momentum @xmath1 in the point @xmath22 to leave system without collisions : @xmath27 .",
    "then the result can be presented in the general form found in ref .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath28    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) describes the contribution to the momentum spectrum from particles that are emitted from the very initial time , while the second one describes the continuous emission with emission density @xmath29 from 4d volume delimited by the initial and final ( where particles stop to interact ) 3d hypersurfaces .",
    "in what follows we will use the ( generalized ) relaxation time approximation proposed in @xcite , which is the basis of the hydro - kinetic approach , described in detail in @xcite .",
    "namely , it was argued @xcite that there is such a local equilibrium distribution function @xmath30 that , in the region of not very small densities where term @xmath31 gives noticeable contribution to particle spectra , the function @xmath32 is approximately equal to that one which would be obtained if all functions in r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ integr ] ) calculated by means of that function @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath33 is determined from the local energy - momentum conservation laws based on the non - equilibrium function @xmath32 in the way specified in @xcite .",
    "then , in accordance with this approach we use @xmath34 the  relaxation time \" @xmath35 grows with time in this method .",
    "let us generalize now the landau / cooper - frye prescription ( cfp ) of sudden freeze - out .",
    "for this aim we apply the saddle point method to calculate the integral in the expression for spectra ( [ spectrum ] ) with account of ( [ leq ] ) . to simplify notation",
    "we neglect the contribution to the spectra from hadrons which are already free at the initial thermalization time @xmath36 fm / c and thus omit the first term in ( [ integr ] ) .",
    "to provide straightforward calculations leading to the cooper - frye form let us shift the spacial variables , @xmath37 , in ( [ spectrum ] ) aiming to eliminate the variable @xmath38 in the argument of the function @xmath39 which is the integrand in @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 where @xmath42 note that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is connected with the escape probability @xmath45 : @xmath46 therefore @xmath47    the saddle point @xmath48 is defined by the standard conditions : @xmath49 then one can get from ( [ mom - spectr-1 ] ) , ( [ mom - spectr-2 ] ) the condition of the maximum of emission : @xmath50    if one neglects terms @xmath51 in l.h.s . and",
    "supposes that in the rest frame ( marked be asterisk ) of the fluid element with four - velocity @xmath52 the collision rate , @xmath53 , does not depend on particle momentum : @xmath54 ( here @xmath55 is particle density , @xmath8 is the particle cross - section , @xmath56 is the relative velocity , @xmath57 means the average over all momenta ) , then the conditions ( [ 6 - 8 ] ) are equivalent to the requirement that at the temporal point of maximum of the emission function the rate of collisions is equal to the rate of system expansion @xcite .",
    "this is the heuristic freeze - out criterion for sudden freeze - out @xcite .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate , the neglect of momentum dependence leads to quite significant errors .    to pass to the cooper - frye representation we use the variables which include the saddle point : @xmath58",
    "then the expression for the spectrum takes the form : @xmath59 where the emission density in saddle point representation is ( @xmath60 ) @xmath61 according to eq .",
    "( [ probab ] ) @xmath62 , since the freeze - out zone is the region of the last collision for the particle .",
    "then the normalization condition for @xmath63 ( @xmath63 is presented by the bottom line in ( [ spe ] ) ) allows one to determine the temporal width of the emission at the point @xmath64 : @xmath65    therefore if the temporal homogeneity length @xmath66 of the distribution function @xmath67 near the 4-point @xmath0 is much larger than the width of the emission zone , @xmath68 , then one can approximate @xmath69 by @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) and perform integration over @xmath71 accounting for normalizing condition ( [ norm ] ) . as a result",
    "we get from ( [ sps ] ) and ( [ spe ] ) the momentum spectrum in a form similar to the cooper - frye one ( [ cfp ] ) : @xmath72    it is worthy to note that the representation of the spectrum through emission function ( [ spectrum ] ) is the result of the integration of the total non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath73 , eqs .",
    "( [ integr ] ) , ( [ leq ] ) , over the asymptotical hypersurface in time , while the approximate representation of the spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ mom - sp14 ] ) , uses only the local equilibrium part @xmath67 of the total function @xmath73 at the set of points of maximal emission - at hypersurface @xmath0 .",
    "now let us summarize the conditions when the landau / cooper - frye form for sudden freeze - out can be used .",
    "they are the following :    \\i ) for each momentum @xmath74 , there is a region of @xmath5 where the emission function as well as the function @xmath63 , eq .",
    "( [ mom - sp3 ] ) , have a clear maximum .",
    "the temporal width of the emission @xmath75 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ spe ] ) , which is found to be equal to the relaxation time ( inverse of collision rate ) , should be smaller than the corresponding temporal homogeneity length of the distribution function : @xmath76 .",
    "\\ii ) the contribution to the spectrum from the residual region of @xmath5 , where the saddle point method ( gaussian approximation ( [ spe ] ) and/or condition @xmath77 ) is violated , does not affect essentially the particle momentum density .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied , then the momentum spectra can be presented in the cooper - frye form _ despite the fact that actually it is not sudden freeze - out and the decoupling region has a finite temporal width _",
    "@xmath78 .",
    "the analytical results as for the temporal width of the spectra agree remarkably with the numerical calculations of pion emission function within hydro - kinetic model ( hkm ) @xcite .",
    "for example , near the point of maximum , @xmath79 fm / c , @xmath80 gev , the ",
    "experimental \" temporal width @xmath81 obtained by numerical solution of the complete hydro - kinetic equations is @xmath82 fm ( see fig . 1 , left ) . our theoretical estimate is @xmath83 fm , since the rate of collisions in this phase - space point is @xmath84 fm / c , @xmath85= 0.2 gev , @xmath86 c / fm .",
    "it is worthy to emphasize that such a generalized cooper - frye representation is related to _ freeze - out hypersurfaces that depend on the momentum _ @xmath74 and",
    "_ typically do not enclose the initially dense matter_. in fig . 1 , one can see the structure of the emission domains for different @xmath87 in hkm @xcite for initially ( at @xmath88=1 fm / c ) gaussian energy density profile with @xmath89= 6 gev/@xmath90 .",
    "the maximal emission regions for different @xmath87 are crossed by isotherms with different temperatures : 80 mev for low momenta and 135 mev for high ones .",
    "this is completely reflected in the concave structure of the transverse momentum spectrum as one can see in fig .",
    "2 .    if a part of the hypersurface @xmath2 is non - space - like and corresponds to the maximum of the emission of particles with momentum @xmath74 , directed outward the system , the same part of the hypersurface can not correspond to the maximal emission for particles with momentum directed inward the system .",
    "it is clear that the emission function at these points is close to zero for such particles .",
    "even formally , in the gaussian approximation ( [ spe ] ) for @xmath63 , validated in the region of its maximal value , the integral @xmath91 , if particle world line crosses almost the whole system . the latter results in @xmath92 and , therefore , completely destroys the saddle - point approximation ( [ max ] ) for @xmath63 and then the cooper - frye form ( [ mom - sp14 ] ) for spectra . recall that if a particle crosses some non - space - like part of the hypersurface @xmath8 moving inward the system , this corresponds to the condition @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "hence the value @xmath93 in the generalized cooper - frye formula ( [ mom - sp14 ] ) should be _ always _ positive : @xmath94 across the hypersurface where fairly sharp maximum of emission of particles with momentum @xmath74 is situated ; and so requirement @xmath94 is a necessary condition for @xmath95 to be a true hypersurface of the maximal emission .",
    "it means that hypersurfaces of maximal emission for a given momentum @xmath74 may be open in the space - time , not enclosing the high - density matter at the initial time @xmath96 , and different for different @xmath74 .",
    "all this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , where the structure of particle emission domain is shown for two groups of particles . in the first one , the momentum is directed as the radius vector to the point of particle localization ( they move outward the system ) , in the second one - in opposite direction ( they move inward ) .",
    "the points of maximum for different @xmath87 , where cooper - frye form can be applied , do not overlap .",
    "the calculations have been done in hkm@xmath97@xcite .",
    "therefore , there are no negative contributions to the particle momentum density from non - space - like sectors of the freeze - out hypersurface , that is a well known shortcoming of the cooper - frye prescription @xcite ; the negative contributions could appear only as a result of utilization of improper freeze - out hypersurface that roughly ignores its momentum dependence and so is common for all @xmath74 . if , anyhow , such a common hypersurface will be used , e.g. as the hypersurface of the maximal particle number emission ( integrated over @xmath74 ) , there is no possibility to justify the approximate expression for momentum spectra similar to eq .",
    "( [ mom - sp14 ] ) .",
    "our analysis and numerical calculations show that the widely used phenomenological landau/ cooper - frye prescription for calculation of pion ( or other particle ) spectrum is too rough if the freeze - out hypersurface is considered as common for all momenta of pions .",
    "the cooper - frye formula , however , could be applied in generalized form accounting for direct momentum dependence of the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath98 ; the latter corresponds to the maximum of emission function @xmath99 at fixed momentum @xmath74 in an appropriate region of @xmath5 . if such a hypersurface @xmath98 is found , the condition of applicability of the cooper - frye formula _ for given _",
    "@xmath74 is that the width of the maximum , which in the simple cases - e.g. , for one component system or at domination of elastic scatterings - is just the relaxation time ( inverse of collision rate ) , should be smaller than the corresponding temporal homogeneity length of the distribution function .",
