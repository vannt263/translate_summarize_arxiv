    "the development of quantum information theory [ 1 ] has drawn attention to fundamental questions about what is physically possible and what is not .",
    "an example is the quantum no - cloning theorem [ 2,3 ] , which asserts that unknown pure states can not be reproduced or copied by any physical means .",
    "wootters and zurek [ 2 ] shows that the cloning machines violates the quantum superposition principles , which applies to a minimum total number of three states , and hence does not rule out the possibility of cloning two non - orthogonal states .",
    "yuen and dariano [ 4,5 ] show that a violation of unitarity makes the cloning of two non - orthogonal states impossible . recently ,",
    "barnum et al . [ 6 ] have extended such results to the case of mixed states , and it was shown that two non - commuting mixed states can not be broadcast onto two separate quantum systems , even when the states need only be reproduced marginally .",
    "more recently , koashi and imoto [ 7 ] extended the standard no - cloning theorem to the case of a subsystem correlated to others and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for two pure states , each entangled in two remote systems , to be clonable by the sequential access to the two systems .",
    "identification and clone have close relation and also we can not identify an arbitrary unknown state . since",
    "quantum states can not be cloned and identified faithfully , recently , the inaccurate coping and discriminating of quantum states have aroused great interest .",
    "the inaccurate coping and discriminating of quantum states can be divided into two main categories : universal and state - dependent .",
    "the first category is aimed at the approximate clone or identification of an arbitrary state [ 8 - 13 ] , of which the figuration of merit is the local fidelity . the second category is designed to identify and clone only a finite number of states and here we can identify two sub - categories .",
    "approximate state - dependent cloning machines deterministically generate approximate clones of state belonging to a finite set [ 14 - 16 ] .",
    "exact state - dependent cloning machines clone a set of non - orthogonal but liner - independent pure states with the limited success probability [ 17 - 20 ] . this job is done by duan and guo and they have found the maximum success probability if these copies are required to be exact clones .",
    "duan and guo have provided a new possibility to copy states and demonstrated that these clones can get to the maximum success probability which is non - zero .",
    "more recently , we [ 21 ] constructed general discriminating strategies of the quantum states secretly chosen from a certain set , given initial @xmath0 copies of each state , and obtained the matrix inequality , which describe the bound between the maximum probability of correctly determining and that of error .",
    "we [ 22 ] also obtained the unitary representations and hamiltonians for the most general quantum probabilistic clone and identification of @xmath1 linear independent states with the given probability .",
    "for application we realized it in @xmath2-state system with universal quantum logic gates under the condition that the maximum probability is chosen .    in this paper we will apply our method , which was provided in [ 22 ] , and realize the probabilistic cloning and identifying linear independent quantum states of multi - particles system with universal logic gates .",
