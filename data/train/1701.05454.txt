    "then , @xmath78 collides with @xmath77 , and they both leave the ionic core . during the second collision , the peaks in both @xmath122 and @xmath123 indicate that the impact electron and @xmath78 are both involved in the ionization of @xmath77 . nonetheless , the impact electron contributes less to the ionization process during the second collision , so the dominant interaction is between the two electrons of the target .",
    "so , we consider that the impact electron has had only one interaction with the electrons of the target , and this makes it a ts1 mechanism .    in the ts2 mechanism",

    "first , the impact electron collides with @xmath78 , and @xmath78 leaves the ionic core .",
    "subsequently , the impact electron collides with @xmath77 , and both leave the ionic core .    comparing the local maxima of @xmath126 and",
    "@xmath125 around @xmath48 ( time of impact ) , we numerically discriminate trajectories belonging to ts1 or ts2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : manifold ] , we observe that double ionizations occur in highly localized regions in phase space ( at least in the slice we consider in fig .",
    "[ fig : manifold ] ) .",
    "moreover , the ts1 and ts2 regions are intertwined , i.e. it is difficult to predict which mechanism will be involved for a given initial condition . also on the slice depicted on this figure",

    "i.e. the interaction between the ionic core and the electrons is negligible .",
    "consequently , hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) reduces to @xmath131 irrespective of the relative positions of the three electrons . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_energy ] ) , a necessary energy condition to obtain double ionization is @xmath132 as confirmed by the double ionization probability in fig .",
    "[ fig : si_di ] . during an ionization process",
    ", electrons have a tendency to escape with large relative distances because of electron - electron repulsion , i.e. @xmath133 .",
    "consequently , the interaction between the electrons vanishes and the hamiltonian can be decomposed as the sum of the final three kinetic energies , denoted @xmath134 , such that @xmath135 since @xmath136 , the final energy of each electron does not exceed the total energy of the system , i.e. @xmath137 for all @xmath129 . in particular ,",
    "because of inequality  ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) and since @xmath93 is composed of the sum of the energy of two electrons , eq .",
    "( [ eq : before_after ] ) leads to @xmath138 .",
    "this is confirmed by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : energy ] and [ fig : manifold ] , where we observe that the double ionization regions on fig .",
    "[ fig : manifold ] correspond to dark gray ( dark red online ) regions on fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , representing @xmath138 .",
    "double ionization occurs only if the final energy of the target atom is positive , which happens , as we observe on fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] , only in the region @xmath139 { \\ ; \\mathrm{ev}}$ ] .",
    "we notice that this range contains the range where double ionization probability is non - zero ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : si_di ] and [ fig : mechanisms ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] , we see that the maximum of the average energy of the atom @xmath112 after impact is obtained for @xmath140 , which is consistent with the impact energy leading to the maximum double ionization probability ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : si_di ] ) .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] , we observe that for any impact energy , double ionization is clearly dominated by the ts2 mechanism .",
    "the ts1 mechanism occurs in the range @xmath141 { \\ ; \\mathrm{ev}}$ ] , while ts2 occurs in a broader range of impact energies @xmath62 { \\ ; \\mathrm{ev}}$ ] , which is the range of impact energy where double ionizations are detected .",
    "so here again , the results of figs .  [ fig : si_di ] and [ fig : pdf ] are consistent with the energy conditions .    in summary , the classical model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) displays only two double ionization mechanisms which are direct , ruling out indirect mechanisms like excitation - autoionization for our two - active electron model . for the ts1 mechanism , the correlation between the electrons of the target atom",
    "is largely involved , whereas this correlation is neglected in the ts2 mechanism . a necessary condition to obtain double ionization",
    "is that the energy of the atom after the impact is positive , i.e. @xmath138 . the ts2 mechanism is the dominant scenario for double ionization .",

    "[ fig : mechanisms ] and [ fig : mechanims_b ] , we observe that decreasing the softening parameter @xmath30 increases the double ionization probability as expected , and extends the range of impact energy @xmath18 where double ionization is observed .",
    "the behavior before the maximum double ionization probability is similar , but after the maximum , the decrease is smoother , as observed in the experimentally measured total double ionization cross sections .",
    "the ts2 mechanism is even more dominant than for @xmath149 in comparison with the ts1 contribution .",
    "concerning the single ionization mechanisms , we notice that the contribution of the direct single ionization is increased and even dominant for large values of the impact energy , in contrast with the @xmath150 case .",
    "however , we will see below that this is an artefact of a final integration time @xmath146 .",
    "moreover , we have seen that for decreasing @xmath30 , the intertwining observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : manifold ] and [ fig : energy ] is more regular ( not pictured in this article ) .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath30 increases , we observe an increase of the sensitivity to initial conditions , and the appearance chaotic sea .",
    "comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : mechanisms ] and [ fig : mechanisms_ip ] , we observe that if @xmath151 , the ionization probabilities decreases significantly , but the qualitative feature of the curves remains almost identical .",
    "the influence of the impact parameter on the probability curves is only quantitative .",
    "taking @xmath49 allows a higher probability to obtain ionization .",
    "finally , we observe that the integration time @xmath146 does not influence the double ionization probability and the direct single ionization curves . indeed , because delayed ionization processes can take an arbitrary long time , the longer the integration time @xmath146 is , the higher the delayed ionization probability will be .",
    "we notice that delayed ionization becomes more dominant . furthermore , increasing @xmath146 moves the maximum of the single ionization probability to the left .",
    "however , for sufficiently long integration times ( e.g. @xmath152 ) the delayed single ionization converges , so that considering larger integration times is unnecessary for practical purposes .    in summary , the softening parameter @xmath30 , the impact parameter @xmath144 , and the integration time @xmath146",
    "influence some features of the ionization probability curves , like for instance the amount of single and double ionization . however , some features remain unchanged , like the predominance of delayed single ionization and of ts2 double ionization . in terms of the mechanisms ,",
    "the analysis we presented is robust with respect to changes in these parameters .",
    "in summary , we proposed a two - active electron classical hamiltonian model for the @xmath1 and @xmath11 processes for a target atom with two loosely bound electrons , which reproduces notable features of the experimentally measured single and double ionization cross sections .",
    "we have shown that a two - dimensional model is capable of capturing some features of the experimentally measured curves .",
    "the classical approach allowed us to identify the mechanisms involved in the ionization processes by examining trajectories in phase space , and their relative contributions by analyzing families of trajectories .",

    "the behavior of these mechanisms as a function of the impact energy @xmath18 has been studied , as well as where they occur in phase space .",
    "the delayed single ionization displays a strong dependence with respect to initial conditions , and is associated with single ionization by chaotic diffusion .",
    "the ts2 mechanism is found to dominate in the double ionization processes , in agreement with existing experiments .",
    "the significant disagreement between the double ionization probability from hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and the experimentally measured double ionization cross section @xcite suggests a large contribution of the inner shell electrons in the double ionization processes for @xmath153 . a two - active electron model can not reproduce this feature , nor reproduce fully the knee observed in the double ionization cross section",
