    "rapid progress has been made in the past decade in discovering other planetary systems and in building theories for their formation and evolution .",
    "more than 300 extrasolar planets have been found through measuring stellar radial velocities and about 60 planets have been observed to transit their stars ( extrasolar planets encyclopaedia , http://exoplanet.eu/ )",
    ". however , these techniques are optimal in finding systems dramatically different from the solar system , with giant planets in orbits very close to their stars .",
    "there are two primary avenues for probing systems with planets that might have structures more analogous to that of the solar system .",
    "first , giant planets have recently been imaged around fomalhaut @xcite and hr 8799 @xcite in orbits with radii of tens of au .",
    "second , the spitzer space telescope ( _ spitzer _ , @xcite ) has observed more than 200 debris disks , which represent dust production from colliding planetesimals , typically in zones analogous to the asteroid and kuiper belts in the solar system .",
    "it is expected that these debris disks are sculpted by giant planets through gravitational interactions ( wyatt 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "observations and models of well - studied examples show a wide variety of structures and behavior , possibly related to the individual quirks of their ( unseen ) planetary systems and their evolutionary states ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hr 8799 has been known to have a prominent debris system presumably sculpted by unseen planets @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of three giant planets orbiting this star , along with estimates of their masses and orbits , provides a new opportunity to understand in more detail the forces that shape debris disks .",
    "this paper reports new measurements with _",
    "spitzer _ that fully characterize the debris disk around hr 8799 .",
    "we show that the debris system includes at least three components : warm dust interior to the three planets ; cold dust exterior to them ; and a halo of small grains surrounding the cold dust zone .",
    "the placement of the first two disk components appears to be as expected from the orbits of the planets .",
    "the dynamics of the three massive planets @xcite suggests substantial dynamical excitation in the overall planetary system .",
    "the elevated level of dynamical activity in the cold dust zone , which is the source of the large halo , is possibly a result of the unstable state of the system .",
    "the 20160 myr age of the system @xcite corresponds to a critical phase in the history of our own solar system when planet formation processes were near completion and the solar system s dynamical configuration was being established .",
    "the hr 8799 debris system offers an exciting view of this phase of planetary system formation and evolution .",
    "we present the new observations in  2 , describe the general observational results in  3 , build detailed models in  4 , and discuss the implications of this work in  5 .",
    "the observations presented here are from the _ spitzer _ director s discretionary time ( ddt ) program 530 and guaranteed time observations ( gto ) program 50175 that utilize all of the major observation modes of both the infrared spectrograph ( irs , @xcite ) and the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , @xcite ) .",

    "the calibration factors used to transfer the instrumental units to the physical unit ( mjy ) are adopted from the mips calibration papers @xcite .    to ensure the best flat field result at 24 @xmath3 , a second flat field made from a median stack of the data with all bright sources masked out",
    "was also applied in addition to the regular scan - mirror - dependent flat fielding ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the flux density of the source at 24 @xmath3  was estimated using aperture photometry with both small and large apertures ( the same photometry parameters as used in @xcite ) .",
    "the large aperture gives a flux density of 83.0@xmath40.5 mjy , while the small aperture gives a flux density of 80.8@xmath40.7 mjy ( @xmath02.7% lower ) , implying the source profile is more extended than a true point source .",
    "therefore , to capture all the flux from the extended component , we conducted photometry with a very large ( radius of 35 ) aperture on an image with the dc offset and all background sources subtracted without a sky annulus ( i.e. , the aperture photometry was relative to the median pixel value for the entire frame ; therefore , an aperture correction of 1.06 was applied , see @xcite ) .",
    "the final measured flux we adopted is 86.4 mjy ( before color correction ) .",
    "the center of the source at 24 @xmath3  was determined using a 2-d gaussian fitting routine , and it coincides with the expected stellar position within the pointing error ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the flux contribution in the 24 @xmath3  band is mostly from the stellar photosphere ( 58 mjy ; see  [ photosphere ] ) .",
    "the stellar photosphere was then subtracted by scaling an observed blue point spread function ( psf ) .",

    "several region sizes were tried .",

    "aperture photometry was used to estimate the flux density for the source since it is extended .",
    "an aperture of 42  in radius ( 1-@xmath9 boundary ) was used with a sky annulus of 4454 . after correcting for lost light based on the same aperture settings applied to a theoretical psf",
    ", the final integrated 70 @xmath3  flux density is 545 mjy ( before color correction ) .",
    "the 160 @xmath3  data were taken in the `` enhanced aot '' to allow them to be time filtered , as was also done for the 70 @xmath3  data ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "no additional 160 @xmath3  psf was obtained for the purpose of leak subtraction as it has been shown that the ghost image produced by the 160 @xmath3  filter leakage is less than @xmath015 times of the photospheric flux density at 160 @xmath3 .",
    "the disk is @xmath0400 times brighter than the photosphere in this channel ( see tab .",

    "this is also confirmed by careful inspection of the data where the expected ghost image lies .",

    "aperture photometry is used to determine the integrated flux . to minimize the influence of the background cirrus , we used small aperture sizes ( 16  and 24 ) , sky annuli ( 64128 ) and aperture corrections ( 4.683 and 2.613 for a red point source of 50 k ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resultant integrated 160 @xmath3  flux density is 539 mjy ( before color - correction ) .",

    "this procedure would under - correct for the slightly extended source and may explain why there is small offset ( @xmath017% at the fiducial wavelength of the 70 @xmath3  band ) between the 70 @xmath2 m photometry and the mips - sed spectrum .",
    "the final mips sed - mode spectrum is smoothed to match the resolution at the long - wavelength portion of the spectrum ( r=15 ) .    the basic reduction and extraction of the irs spectral data were provided by the ssc irs pipeline s18.5 .",

    "they all lie between the two dust reservoirs . in general",
    ", the location of the dust that is at a specific thermal equilibrium temperature depends on the grain properties ( through the absorption efficiency @xmath28 , which is size dependent ) .",
    "the equilibrium dust temperature is computed by balancing the absorption and emission energy and ultimately it depends on cross sections ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the grain radius ) ; therefore , the temperature of large grains is generally lower than that of small grains at the same distance from the heating source .",
    "we adopt the optical constants for astronomical silicates @xcite and compute the grain properties ( @xmath31 values for the absorption and scattering efficiency for grain radii of 0.11000 @xmath3  in size ) using mie theory with additional modifications for large sizes ( @xmath3210 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the resultant thermal equilibrium dust temperatures as a function of radius from the star are shown in figure [ radius_td ] . due to the nature of an optically thin debris system",
    ", any dust in a continuous spatial distribution between the two distinct temperature components will have intermediate temperatures , resulting in a smoother excess sed between 2055 @xmath3  ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the sed shape and the distinct characteristic dust temperatures strongly suggest that very little dust resides between the two components .",
    "based on figure [ radius_td ] , the emitting zone for the warm component is between @xmath05 and @xmath015 au , with an angular diameter of @xmath5 1 .",
    "this component , which dominates the emission detected in the irs spectrum and the mips 24 @xmath3  band , should be unresolved at 24 @xmath3  ( inside planet  d ) .",
    "a similar calculation indicates that the cold component , if it has a size of @xmath0100 au in radius , should be at best only barely resolved at 24 @xmath3 ; however , the excess sed ( fig",
    ".  [ excesssed ] ) shows that the cold component would contribute only a small ( @xmath33 9% ) portion of the total signal in the mips 24 @xmath3  band .",
    "thus , the flux well outside the psf at 24 @xmath3  suggests the detection of an extended component at this wavelength .",
    "we estimate the flux of the unresolved point source in the 24 @xmath3  image ( star + disk ) by scaling a psf to match the peak flux of the source .",
    "the scaling suggests that the central unresolved component is @xmath078 mjy at maximum ( assuming the extended component contributes no flux at the position of the star ) .",
    "the stellar photosphere is expected to be 58 mjy in the 24 @xmath3  band , so the central unresolved disk component is @xmath020 mjy before color correction . due to the large temperature differences between the warm and cold components ,",
    "different color - corrections must be applied to each of the components at 24 @xmath3  . applying a color - correction factor of 1.055 for a blackbody of 150 k",
    "( see the mips data handbook , http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/mips/dh/ , for the detailed color corrections for the mips bands ) , the total flux density of the central unresolved ( warm ) disk component is @xmath021 mjy , which agrees well with the photosphere - subtracted irs spectrum ( 22.4@xmath41.4 mjy ) .",
    "therefore , the extended disk component is @xmath07.5 mjy ( after applying a color correction of 0.894 for a blackbody of 50 k ) . adding these measurements , the final total flux density for the entire system ( star + two disk components after color corrections for the two different temperatures ) is 86.6 @xmath41.7 mjy ( assumed 2% error based on the nominal calibration uncertainty , @xcite ) .",
    "the expected stellar photosphere is 6.5 mjy in the 70 @xmath3  band , suggesting the disk is @xmath0603 mjy after a color correction factor of 1.12 for a 50 k blackbody .",
    "therefore , the total ( star + disk ) flux density at 70 @xmath3  is 610@xmath431 mjy ( assumed 5% error based on the nominal calibration uncertainty , @xcite ) . at 160 @xmath3 ,",
    "the stellar photosphere is 1.4 mjy ; therefore , the total disk flux density is @xmath0554 mjy after a color correction of 1.03 for a blackbody of 50 k , resulting in a total ( star+disk ) flux of 555@xmath466 mjy ( assumed 12% error based on the nominal calibration uncertainty , @xcite ) .    [ radius_td ]",
    "the 70 @xmath3  image is essentially only from the disk since the star is @xmath331 % of the total flux in the far - infrared .",
    "an observed radial surface brightness profile of the disk at 70 @xmath3  is shown in figure [ radprof70 ] . as was indicated by the fwhm measurements ,",
    "the disk is clearly resolved .",
    "the structure of the disk at 70 @xmath3  is similar to the one at 24 @xmath3 , a bright core and an extended disk ; however , the bright core at 70 @xmath3  can not originate from the warm component seen at 24 @xmath3  ( because the temperature is too cold ) .",
    "this bright core is most likely to originate from a dust belt ( hereafter the planetesimal disk ) outside planet  b , where emission by dust is also detected at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "consistent with this possibility , the emission at 850 @xmath3  is mostly confined within 20  ( diameter ) based on the jcmt / scuba measurements @xcite . however ,",
    "if the dust emitting at 70 @xmath3  all originated from the same location as in the submillimeter , the disk could not be resolved by mips at 70 @xmath3  .",
    "in addition , @xcite also estimate the outer edge of the cold dust component is between 125 and 170 au ( a narrow ring ) based on simple sed fitting and assumed grain properties . given the nominal resolution of 18  in the mips 70 @xmath3  band , any disk structure that is smaller than 360 au in radius is not resolvable at a distance of 40 pc .",
    "the large measured fwhms at 70 @xmath3  suggest that the extended emission at 70 @xmath3  must originate from a component outside the planetesimal disk .    limited by the large beam size at 70 @xmath3 , the current data can not differentiate whether there is any gap between the planetesimal disk and the extended component .",
    "we can only estimate the bright core ( presumably the planetesimal disk ) flux by normalizing a psf to match the peak of the observed flux ( this procedure provides an upper limit ) or to match the flux within a 10  radius ( to provide a lower limit ) .",
    "after color correction for 50 k , the unresolved core flux density is 285387 mjy , suggesting that the extended component is roughly equal in integrated brightness to the unresolved core .      based on 10 years of astrometric data on planet b , @xcite suggest an orbital inclination of 1323  off the plane of the sky .",
    "in addition , both @xcite and @xcite suggest that the system is unlikely to be exactly face - on from stability analyses of the planetary configuration .",
    "the resolved image at 24 @xmath3  provides very little constraint because the emission at this wavelength is mostly dominated by the central unresolved disk . the resolved image at 70 @xmath3  appears to be relatively azimuthally symmetric . from @xmath0100",
    "mips observations of a routine calibrator , hd  180711 ( g9 iii , 447 mjy at 70 @xmath3 ) , the measured fwhm ratio is 1.044@xmath40.023 for a point source at 70 @xmath3 . the measured fwhm ratio ( 1.008 ) of the hr 8799 70 @xmath3  disk suggests a deviation of @xmath01.5-@xmath9 from a face - on symmetric disk . from model images ( see discussion in  [ analysis : thermal_model ] ) constructed for various inclination angles , we can rule out any angles that are larger than @xmath025  because the resultant images give a ratio much larger than the measured value .",
    "[ radprof70 ]      in summary , the resolved disks at 24 and 70 @xmath3  indicate that the disk around hr 8799 has at least three components : a warm belt inside planet  d , a planetesimal disk outside of planet  b with extension of @xmath3310 , and a surrounding large extended disk .",
    "the separation into these three components and their placement relative to the planets in the system appear to be largely independent of assumed grain sizes and optical properties .",
    "all of the observed flux densities , including those for the three disk components , are listed in table [ tbl : fluxes ] .",
    "[ radprof24 ]",
    "we now build on the observational results of the preceding section through more detailed models of the hr 8799 debris disk .",
    "although these specific models are under - constrained and hence not unique , they are guided by models of other debris systems and fit the observations of hr 8799 .",
    "therefore , they give a plausible picture of the disk behavior . in   [ analysis : surface_brightness_distribution ] , we constrain the disk extent by fitting the observed surface brightness profiles with assumed powerlaw profiles that are independent of grain properties . the main purpose of this exercise is to derive spatial information that can be used in a realistic thermal model . in ",
    "[ analysis : thermal_model ] , we then utilize the disk components that are inferred from the observations with the adopted grain properties to estimate the physical extent and masses required for the dust in each component .      because of our low angular resolution , it is convenient to characterize the disk using radially averaged surface brightness distributions , represented as a mean value at a given radius and the standard deviation of the mean . for simplicity , we assume that the disk is face - on , so an azimuthally averaged radial profile can be used for modeling .",
    "this approximation greatly reduces the noise by averaging the intensity at a given radius ( a similar approach has been used on the disks around vega @xcite and @xmath34 eri @xcite ) .",
    "the surface brightness radial profile of the disk ( after psf subtraction for the stellar photosphere and masking out all nearby sources ) at 24 @xmath3  is shown in figure [ radprof24]a .",

    "the radial profile of the unresolved @xmath6 lep disk agrees well with the theoretical psf , while it is clear that the second dark and the third bright airy rings of the hr 8799 disk ( in the range of @xmath020  to @xmath030  from the center ) are brighter than for a point source .    by subtracting the scaled radial profile of the @xmath6 lep disk from the observed radial profile of hr 8799 , a rough disk surface brightness distribution for the extended disk component",

    "as shown in figures [ radprof70 ] and [ radprof24 ] , the true disk structure is masked by the instrumental psfs .",
    "one way to understand the structure of the disk is to construct a trial surface brightness distribution , convolve it with the beam , and then compare with the observed data .",
    "in particular , this approach is a practical way to constrain the true disk outer radius in the low - resolution images .",
    "since our goal is to set constraints on the main planetesimal disk , the 24 @xmath3  profile in the following fits is for the extended disk only .",
    "the simplest model is to assume that the surface brightness profile follows a power - law , @xmath36 , between an inner break radius ( @xmath37 ) and outer cut - off radius ( @xmath38 ) . in an optically thin debris disk where the only heating source is the stellar radiation and",
    "the disk density is only a function of radius in a power - law form of @xmath39 , the radial surface brightness is then proportional to @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the planck function , and @xmath42 is the radial - dependent dust temperature ( generally , @xmath43 for small grains and @xmath44 for large grains ) .",
    "this simple power - law formula has been used to fit the well - resolved vega disk at both 24 and 70 @xmath3 , and it was found that the power indices change from @xmath45 for the inner part of the disk to @xmath46 for the outer part of the disk @xcite . an inner break point is needed in this simple power - law for steep indices ( @xmath473 or 4 ) ; otherwise , the profile mimics a point source after convolution with the psf .",
    "because the outermost planet is at a radius of @xmath02 , we also set the disk surface brightness to zero inside 2 , i.e. , @xmath480 for @xmath492  ( @xmath50 stands for @xmath51 ) .",
    "[ radprof_fits ]    we have tried four different cases for the model surface brightness distribution : ( 1 ) a larger inner hole with @xmath52=4 , ( 2 ) a flat distribution between @xmath53 and @xmath37 but with @xmath52=4 outward , ( 3 ) a single powerlaw with @xmath52=2 , and ( 4 ) two powerlaws with indices of @xmath52=2 and @xmath52=3 . in all cases , we varied @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the surface brightness distribution ( two free parameters ) and computed the reduced @xmath54 value to determine the best fit . the reduced @xmath54 value was computed for data points between 540 , and between 575  at 24 and 70 @xmath3 , respectively .",

    ".    however , qualitatively , the halo around hr 8799 resembles the behavior of vega closely and differs substantially from the observations of most other a - stars , indicating that both systems are currently undergoing an enhanced level of dynamical stirring in their outer planetesimal disks that leads to an elevated production rate for small grains with @xmath96 near unity .",
    "these grains will eventually be ground down to sizes that participate in a general outflow from the system .",

    "grains extending up to about five times the nominal blowout size were required .",
    "this apparent discrepancy probably arises because , for simplicity , the models are based on solid , spherical grains , whereas real grains are likely to be non - spherical and complex in structure with a substantial volume of voids ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "the observed ratio for hr 8799 is 15 times higher , qualitatively similar to the vega system , where the mass in blown out grains is about 30 times the predicted static level .",
    "both systems have much more prominent halos than systems such as fomalhaut @xcite and @xmath96 leo ( stock et al . in prep . ) .",
    "this comparison indicates that there is an elevated level of dynamical activity in the bound disks of vega and hr 8799 that is enhancing the production of small grains .",
    "although we have proceeded by analogy with vega , future work should address the role of weakly bound grains in more detail .",
    "the conclusion that the halo indicates more dynamical activity than in a stars without such halos should be robust , but more complete modeling should draw out other aspects of the hr 8799 system .      based on the `` resonance overlap '' condition in the planar circular restricted three body problem , the width of the chaotic region , @xmath108 , in the vicinity of a planet with mass of @xmath109 and orbital semi - major of @xmath110 orbiting a star with mass of @xmath111 is given by @xcite , @xmath112 adopting the nominal parameters from @xcite , stellar mass 1.5 @xmath25 , planet masses 7 @xmath113 and 10 @xmath113 , and semi - major axes 24 or 68 au for planets d and b , respectively , the width of the unstable zone near each planet is is @xmath08 and @xmath023 au , respectively .",
    "therefore , the locations of the outer edge of the inner dust belt ( @xmath015 au ) and the inner edge of the outer belt ( @xmath090 au ) are both consistent with gravitational sculpting by the innermost known planet d and the outermost known planet b , respectively .",
    "the nearly dust - free zone interior to @xmath06 au may indicate the presence of additional unseen inner planets .",
    "if so , then this leads to an estimate of the timescale of inner planet formation of @xmath520160 myr given the age of hr 8799 .",
    "this is in good agreement with theoretical calculations for terrestrial planet accretion @xcite as well as isotopic constraints on the age of the earth @xcite .",
    "the existence of the halo indicates that the outer planetesimal disk is heavily stirred due either to : ( 1 ) the planets not being in a stable configuration @xcite ; ( 2 ) planet migration and orbital resonance crossings that are causing extreme excitation in the planetesimal disk , as in models for the kuiper belt @xcite and for the late heavy bombardment @xcite ; or ( 3 ) processes in the planetesimal disk itself , such as ongoing formation of ( unseen ) ice giants or planetary embryos that stir the disk @xcite .",
    "the first two possibilities relate the dynamical activity in the planetesimal disk to issues associated with the stability of the configuration of the three known planets , while the third hypothesis would be independent of the planets .",
    "although no specific conclusions can be drawn , the outcomes of any of these scenarios are a heavily stirred planetesimal disk that produces an era of enhanced collisional activity .",

    "<S> we distinguish three components to the debris system : ( 1 ) warm dust ( t @xmath0 150 k ) orbiting within the innermost planet ; ( 2 ) a broad zone of cold dust ( t @xmath0 45 k ) with a sharp inner edge , orbiting just outside the outermost planet and presumably sculpted by it ; and ( 3 ) a dramatic halo of small grains originating in the cold dust component . the high level of dynamical activity implied by this halo may arise due to enhanced gravitational stirring by the massive planets . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively young age of hr 8799 places it in an important early stage of development and may provide some help in understanding the interaction of planets and planetary debris , an important process in the evolution of our own solar system . </S>"
