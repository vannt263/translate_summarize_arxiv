    "strong interaction phases play an important role in the decays of heavy mesons . they produce visible effects in many nonleptonic decays and could be important for the proper interpretation of effects of underlying fundamental physics . for example",
    ", strong phases between isospin amplitudes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 affect branching ratios of individual decays , as well as ratios of rates of isospin - related transitions .",
    "more importantly , they complicate interpretations of cp - violating phases from @xmath4 transitions observed in the so - called direct cp - violating asymmetries .",
    "provided that b - decay amplitude depends on at least two amplitudes with different weak and strong phases ( for example , tree @xmath5 and penguin @xmath6 amplitudes ) , @xmath7 a cp - violating asymmetry can be formed , @xmath8 which clearly depends on both , cp - conserving @xmath9 and cp - violating phase @xmath10 differences . cp - conserving phase difference is associated with strong interactions .",
    "there are , of course , many more examples .",
    "it is threfore important to have a way of computing those phases , which in general would depend on the meson system under consideration .",
    "the difference of the physical picture at the energy scales relevant to @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath0 decays calls for a specific descriptions for each class of decays .",
    "for instance , the relevant energy scale in @xmath11 decays is @xmath13  gev .",
    "with such a low energy release only a few final state channels are available .",
    "this significantly simplifies the theoretical understanding of fsi in kaon decays .",
    "in addition , chiral symmetry can also be employed to assist the theoretical description of fsi in @xmath11 decays . in @xmath12",
    "decays , the relevant scale is @xmath14  gev .",
    "this region is populated by the light quark resonances , so one might expect their significant influence on the decay rates and @xmath15-violating asymmetries .",
    "no model - independent description of fsi is available , but it is hinted at experimentally that the number of available channels is still limited , allowing for a modeling of the relevant qcd dynamics .",
    "finally , in @xmath0 decays , where the relevant energy scale @xmath16  gev is well above the resonance region , the heavy quark limit might prove useful .",
    "final state interactions in @xmath17 arise as a consequence of the unitarity of the @xmath18-matrix , @xmath19 , and involve the rescattering of physical particles in the final state .",
    "the @xmath20-matrix , @xmath21 , obeys the optical theorem : @xmath22 = { 1 \\over 2 } \\sum_{i } \\langle f | { \\cal t}^\\dagger |",
    "i \\rangle \\langle i | { \\cal t } | a \\rangle \\ \\ , \\label{unit}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the discontinuity across physical cut . using @xmath24 in the form @xmath25",
    "this can be transformed into @xmath26 here , the states @xmath27 represent all possible final states ( including @xmath28 ) which can be reached from the state @xmath29 by the weak transition matrix @xmath20 .",
    "the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ opt ] ) can then be viewed as a weak decay of @xmath29 into @xmath27 followed by a strong rescattering of @xmath27 into @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we identify @xmath31 as a fsi rescattering of particles .",
    "notice that if @xmath27 is an eigenstate of @xmath18 with a phase @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 which implies equal rates for the charge conjugated decays - violating asymmetries as no @xmath15 asymmetry is generated in this case . ] .",
    "also @xmath34 the matrix elements @xmath35 are assumed to be the `` bare '' decay amplitudes and have no rescattering phases .",
    "this implies that these transition matrix elements between charge conjugated states are just the complex conjugated ones of each other .",
    "( [ watson ] ) is known as watson s theorem @xcite .",
    "note that the problem of unambiguous separation of `` true bare '' amplitudes from the `` true fsi '' ones ( known as omns problem ) was solved only for a limited number of cases .",
    "while the above discussion gives the most general way of determining strong phases , especially if an s - matrix is easily diagonalized , it might not be the most practical way of dealing with strong phases in @xmath0-decays due to the large number of available channels .",
    "theoretical analysis of decays of heavy - flavored mesons , in particular @xmath0-mesons , simplifies in the limit @xmath36 . in this limit , @xmath37-pair produced in the weak decay of a @xmath38-quark , emerges as a small color dipole .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , as the length scale of @xmath37 production is set by the inverse heavy quark mass , while soft qcd interactions are governed by the length scale associated with @xmath39 , and so their effects will be suppressed by powers of @xmath40 .",
    "then , if @xmath41 decay amplitude is dominated by this two - body - like configuration with small invariant mass , a factorization theorem can be written  @xcite @xmath42 all corrections to eq .",
    "( [ facttheor ] ) should be suppressed by either @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , one can perform phenomenological analysis of @xmath12 and @xmath0-decays to show that amplitude behavior in the large @xmath45 limit is respected  @xcite .",
    "one can use perturbative arguments to calculate final state phases for charmless @xmath0 decays using perturbative qcd  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "@xmath46 process , with subsequent final state rescattering of the two charmed quarks into the final state ( penguin diagram ) does the job , as for the energy release of the order @xmath47 available in @xmath38 decay , the rescattered @xmath48-quarks can go on - shell generating a perturbative cp - conserving phase and thus @xmath49 , which is usually quite small for the experimentally feasible decays , @xmath50",
    ". one might be tempted to conclude that all strong phases in @xmath0-decays should be dominated by perturbative phases from @xmath51 and @xmath52 and therefore be small .",
    "this conclusion , however , will not be correct if , for instance , real part of the decay amplitude happened to be small .",
    "since @xmath53 the smallness of @xmath43 can be easily overpowered by large @xmath54 factor . in addition , @xmath44 corrections could not be computed in at this time . yet , in this framework , it is there non - perturbative contributions to strong phases are introduced",
    ". those contributions could be quite large .",
    "a multitude of @xmath55 and @xmath56 transitions were evaluated in qcd factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite . however , some predictions appear in disagreement with experiemental data  @xcite . among those ,",
    "is the recent observation of @xmath57 branching ratio , @xmath58 , which appears to be quite larger than predicted in qcd factorizaton , @xmath59 , inconsistensies in @xmath60 transitions which rule out small phases predicted by qcdf  @xcite , as well as others  @xcite .",
    "a way to estimate non - perturbative contributions is to model them using approach final state interactions ( fsi ) . in this approach",
    ", a transition @xmath61 is divided into @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the final and intermediate meson states .",
    "an important point is then how to model the rescattering amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "most recent studies  @xcite use a simple t - channel resonance exchange to model the rescattering .",
    "for example , @xmath65 transition with experimental branching ratio of @xmath66 can be affected by a decay @xmath67 with a much larger branching ratios of , say , @xmath68 and subsequent rescattering of @xmath69 into the @xmath70 final state via t - channel @xmath71-resonance exchange . in principle , however , other resonances , such as spin-2 @xmath72 and others should be taken into account .",
    "a rescattering amplitude takes a very simple form , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a coupling constant ( in practice , a @xmath75-dependent form - factor ) , and @xmath76 is a spin of an exchanged particle . a big problem with this form of exchange amplitude",
    "is that it violates unitarity for @xmath77 and thus is not appropriate for @xmath36 limit calculations .",
    "a solution to this problem is well - known and requires reggeization of the scattering amplitudes  @xcite , @xmath78 with @xmath79 being a regge trajectory .",
    "one consequence of this is the fact that high energy fsis are dominated by the multiparticle intermediate states  @xcite . @xmath80",
    "it is known that scattering of high energy particles may be divided into ` soft ' and ` hard ' parts .",
    "soft scattering occurs primarily in the forward direction with limited transverse momentum distribution which falls exponentially with a scale of order @xmath81  gev . at higher transverse momentum one",
    "encounters the region of hard scattering , which can be described by perturbative qcd . in exclusive @xmath0 decay one",
    "faces the difficulty of separating the two .",
    "it might prove useful to employ unitarity in trying to describe fsi in exclusive @xmath0 decays .",
    "it is easy to investigate first the",
    "_ elastic _ channel .",
    "the inelastic channels have to share a similar asymptotic behavior in the heavy quark limit due to the unitarity of the @xmath18-matrix .",
    "the choice of elastic channel is convenient because of the optical theorem which connects the forward ( imaginary ) invariant amplitude @xmath82 to the total cross section , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath75 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the asymptotic total cross sections are known experimentally to rise slowly with energy and can be parameterized by the form @xcite , @xmath85 where @xmath86  gev is a typical hadronic scale . considering only the imaginary part of the amplitude , and building in the known exponential fall - off of the elastic cross section in @xmath75 ( @xmath87 )  @xcite by writing @xmath88",
    "one can calculate its contribution to the unitarity relation for a final state @xmath89 with kinematics @xmath90 and @xmath91 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "one can refine the argument further , since the phenomenology of high energy scattering is well accounted for by the regge theory  @xcite . in the regge model , scattering amplitudes are described by the exchanges of regge trajectories ( families of particles of differing spin ) with the leading contribution given by the pomeron exchange . calculating the pomeron contribution to the elastic final state rescattering in @xmath95 one finds @xcite @xmath96 it is important that the pomeron - exchange amplitude is seen to be almost purely imaginary .",
    "however , of chief significance is the identified weak dependence of @xmath97 on @xmath98  the @xmath99 factor in the numerator is attenuated by the @xmath100 dependence in the effective value of @xmath38 .",
    "the analysis of the elastic channel suggests that , at high energies , fsi phases are _ mainly generated by inelastic effects _",
    ", which follows from the fact that the high energy cross section is mostly inelastic .",
    "this also follows from the fact that the pomeron elastic amplitude is almost purely imaginary . since the study of elastic rescattering has yielded a @xmath20-matrix element @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102 , and since the constraint of unitarity of the @xmath18-matrix implies that the off - diagonal elements are @xmath103 , with @xmath97 approximately @xmath104 in powers of @xmath98 and numerically @xmath105 , then the inelastic amplitude must also be @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "similar conclusions follow from the consideration of the final state unitarity relations .",
    "this complements the old bjorken picture of heavy meson decay ( the dominance of the matrix element by the formation of the small hadronic configuration which grows into the final state pion `` far away '' from the point it was produced and does not interact with the soft gluon fields present in the decay , see also  @xcite for the discussion ) by allowing for the rescattering of multiparticle states , production of whose is favorable in the @xmath36 limit , into the two body final state .",
    "analysis of the final - state unitarity relations in their general form is complicated due to the many contributing intermediate states , but we can illustrate the systematics of inelastic scattering in a two - channel model .",
    "it involves a two - body final state @xmath108 undergoing elastic scattering and a final state @xmath109 which represents ` everything else ' .",
    "as before , the elastic amplitude is purely _ imaginary _ , which dictates the following _ one - parameter _ form for the @xmath110 matrix @xmath111 where we identify @xmath112 .",
    "the unitarity relations become @xmath113 denoting @xmath114 and @xmath115 to be the decay amplitudes in the limit @xmath116 , an exact solution to eq .",
    "( [ big ] ) is given by @xmath117 thus , the phase is given by the inelastic scattering with a result of order @xmath118 clearly , for physical @xmath0 decay , we no longer have a simple one - parameter @xmath18 matrix , and , with many channels , cancellations or enhancements are possible for the sum of many contributions .",
    "however , the main feature of the above result is expected to remain : inelastic channels can not vanish and provide the non - perturbative fsi phase . further studies of flavor - nondiagonal transitions showed that fsis are suppressed by powers of @xmath44  @xcite and thus can be used to estimate nonperturbative strong phases in the heavy quark limit .",
    "i reviewed the physics of final state interactions in meson decays .",
    "i showed that the use of pole exchange graphs to model fsi amplitudes leads to violation of unitarity in the large @xmath119 limit , so consistent studies of high - energy rescattering amplitudes must involve reggiazed rescattering amplitudes .",
    "several examples were provided .",
    "one of the main goals of physics of @xmath15 violation and meson decay is to correctly extract the underlying parameters of the fundamental lagrangian that are responsible for these phenomena .",
    "the understanding of final state interactions is very important for the success of this program .",
