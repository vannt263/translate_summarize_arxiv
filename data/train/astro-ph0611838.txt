    "the rotational velocity is a function of vertical distance from the midplane , and the resultant shear may induce kelvin - helmholtz instability .",

    "we summarize how the results are affected by changing parameters : the size of the computational domain @xmath93 , the restitution coefficient @xmath19 , the optical depth @xmath80 , the ratio of hill radius to the physical diameter @xmath84 , and the duration of collision @xmath130 .",
    "we consider the ratio of the aggregate mass to the total mass , the mass of the largest aggregate , the time evolution of the physical radius , and the radial velocity dispersion of field particles .",
    "we set @xmath181 and vary the size of computational domain from @xmath182 to @xmath183 by keeping the other parameters , @xmath84 , and @xmath130 at fiducial value ( models 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ) .",
    "we use shallow optical depth to reduce the number of particles .",
    "we check the dependence of the final mass of the largest aggregate on the size of the computational domain .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : dep_region_all.eps ] , the final mass and physical radius of the largest aggregate increase as the size of the computational domain increases . the ratios of the aggregate mass to the mass for @xmath184 and @xmath183 are almost constant , and reach about @xmath185 in each model . the aggregate mass is larger for larger calculation size regions because the total mass increases as the size of the computational domain increases .",
    "the largest aggregate continues to grow until it absorbs most field particles and small aggregates .",
    "there is little difference in the radial velocity dispersion of field particles before gi .",
    "in contrast , the final radial velocity dispersion of field particles increases with the size of the computational domain .",
    "the scattering of the field particles is more efficient for the larger aggregate .",
    "therefore , the velocity dispersion increases as the size of the computational domain increases .",
    "we confirmed that the property of the largest aggregate depends on the size of computational domain @xmath76 .",
    "the mass of the largest aggregate increases as the size of computational domain @xmath76 increases .",
    "the largest aggregate stops growing owing to the depletion of field particles . thus , the mass of the largest aggregate in our simulation is not realistic .",
    "we expect that the largest aggregate will possibly stop growing if we perform the simulation on a sufficiently large computational domain .",
    "we will examine this problem in future work .",
    "the restitution coefficient @xmath19 is varied from @xmath186 to @xmath185 ( models 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 ) .",
    "we keep the other parameters , @xmath80 , @xmath84 , @xmath93 , and @xmath130 at the fiducial values .",
    "the energy dissipation due to the inelastic collisions becomes inefficient as the restitution coefficient @xmath19 increases .",
    "if we ignore the energy gain and consider the dissipation due to inelastic collision only , the damping timescale of the velocity dispersion is described as @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is a numerical factor of order of unity @xcite .",
    "the damping timescales are @xmath189 for @xmath190 and @xmath185 , respectively , if we set @xmath191 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : dep_epsilon_all.eps ] , the gravitational instabilities occur only for @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the critical restitution coefficient is @xmath194 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when the restitution coefficient @xmath195 , the dissipation due to collisions is too small to reduce the velocity dispersion .",
    "the energy gain from the boundary is more efficient than the dissipation . in this case",
    ", the velocity dispersion increases monotonically , and the velocity dispersion can not reach the critical value . thus no gravitational instability occurs .    on the other hand , when @xmath196 , the dissipation is efficient and the velocity dispersion can decrease gradually .",
    "the decay timescale depends on @xmath19 and becomes shorter as @xmath19 decreases .",
    "the velocity dispersions become minimum when @xmath197 for @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "this dependence of the minimum timescales @xmath199 on the restitution coefficient agrees approximately with that of the damping timescale @xmath200 estimated by the analytic formula .",
    "when the velocity dispersion reaches the critical value , the gravitational instability occurs .",
    "no remarkable differences are found after the gravitational instability occurs .",
    "the evolution of the size of the largest aggregate , and the ratio of the aggregate mass to the total mass is similar in the models for @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "we study the effect of optical depth @xmath80 by comparing results with @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( models 5 , 1 , and 6 ) .",
    "the collisions occur frequently for larger @xmath80 . in the case of frequent collisions ,",
    "the dissipation of kinetic energy due to inelastic collisions is efficient .",
    "the damping timescales of the velocity dispersion of field particles are @xmath203 @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 for @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "the damping timescale becomes long as the optical depth decreases .",

    "this dependence of the timescales @xmath199 on the optical depth @xmath80 agrees with that of the damping timescale @xmath200 . the final velocity dispersion is larger for larger @xmath80",
    "this is because the difference in the mass of the largest aggregates . the final mass and physical radius of the largest aggregate increases as optical depth @xmath80 increases , as shown in figure [ fig : dep_tau_all.eps ] .",
    "this means that frequent collisions lead to the efficient growth of the largest aggregate .",
    "the ratio of the aggregate mass to the total mass is larger for larger @xmath80 .",
    "the ratio reaches about @xmath185-@xmath208 for @xmath181-@xmath209 .",
    "if the collisions occur frequently , the field particles grow rapidly .",
    "we set @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 and fix the other parameters in the fiducial model except for the optical depth @xmath181 ( models 17 , 18 , and 19 ) .",
    "we test the effect of the hill radius .",
    "the mass and radius of the largest aggregate increase as @xmath84 increases in figure [ fig : dep_hill_all.eps ] .",
    "the hill radius corresponds to the distance from which the particle effects the other particles through gravitational force .",
    "the number of particles that one particle can affect through mutual gravitational force increases as @xmath84 increases .",
    "therefore , the aggregates may absorb field particles more efficiently for larger @xmath84 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of field particles is affected by the large aggregates .",
    "therefore , the velocity dispersion of field particles increases as @xmath84 increases .",
    "the ratio of the aggregate mass to the total mass increases more rapidly for larger @xmath84 . from equation ( [ eq : qq ] ) , the critical velocity dispersion for gi is proportional to @xmath213 .",
    "if we start the calculation from the same velocity dispersions , gi occurs earlier for larger @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , if we set larger @xmath84 , the ratio starts increasing earlier .",
    "the ratios reach about @xmath214 and @xmath185 for @xmath215 and @xmath212 .",
    "the ratio of the aggregate mass to the total mass is larger if @xmath84 is larger .",
    "the realistic hill radius at 1au corresponds to @xmath216 . as stated in the above discussion , a larger aggregate",
    "may be formed in the case where @xmath216 .",
    "however , in the large @xmath84 limit , the mass and radius of the largest aggregate must have upper limits because the mass in the computational domain is fixed .",
    "we will examine the upper limit of the size of the largest aggregate in future work .",
    "we compare the hard - sphere and soft - sphere models and vary the duration of collisions for @xmath217 and @xmath218 ( models 1h , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) in figure [ fig : dep_spring_all.eps ] .",
    "the other parameters are fixed at the fiducial model .",
    "the masses of the largest aggregate reach about @xmath219-@xmath220 .",
    "we do not observe any clear dependence of the mass of the largest aggregate on the duration of collision .",
    "this may be caused by the fluctuation .",
    "the time evolutions of velocity dispersion of the field particles are similar for all models .",
    "there is little difference in the velocity dispersion for the durations of collisions @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the physical radii for the duration of collision @xmath221 is smaller than that for the hard - sphere model . for the soft - sphere model ,",
    "the aggregates can contract and reduce their physical radii . if the aggregates reduce their radius , the restoring harmonic force of each particle increases .",
    "the balance between the restoring harmonic force and the internal gravitational force of the aggregate determine its physical radius .",
    "the restoring harmonic force decreases as the duration of collision increases .",
    "therefore the physical radius for the duration of collision @xmath221 is smaller than that for the other models .",
    "we performed n - body simulations of the dust layers without a gas component using the sliding cell method .",
    "the gravitational force that has cutoff length is included by using the subregion method .",
    "we adopted the hard - sphere and soft - sphere models as collision models .",
    "we considered the region of the disk around @xmath222 where the dynamics are collision - dominated and the hill radius of particles to be much larger than their physical size .",
    "we examined the formation process of planetesimals through the gravitational instability and the time evolution of the fiducial model and its dependence on the system parameters .    if a restitution coefficient @xmath19 is smaller than the critical restitution coefficient @xmath194 , though the velocity dispersion is large , the velocity dispersion decreases owing to inelastic collisions , and gravitational instability occurs when @xmath223 .",
    "we found that the formation process is divided into three stages : the formation of the non - axisymmetric wake - like structures , the formation of aggregates , and the collisional growth of the aggregates .",
    "the non - axisymmetric wake - like structures are formed due to gi .",
    "then the dense parts of wakes fragment into aggregates . the aggregates rapidly grow by mutual collisions . finally",
    ", a few large aggregates absorb other small aggregates and field particles .",
    "we found the masses of planetesimals to be larger than these estimated by linear theory .",
    "the mass range of the aggregates is @xmath224 when the gi occurs . the mass distribution changes with time because of the rapid growth of aggregates .",
    "the mass of the largest aggregates depends on the size of the computational domain and is larger than @xmath225 in our calculation .",
    "we studied the dependence of the results on the system parameters , the optical depth @xmath80 , the ratio of hill radius to the physical diameter @xmath84 , the size of computational domain @xmath93 , the duration of collision @xmath130 , and the restitution coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "we found that the mass and radius of the largest aggregate increase as @xmath80 , @xmath84 , and @xmath93 increase .",
    "however , the ratio of the aggregate mass to the total mass is @xmath226-@xmath208 and almost independent of them .",
    "the aggregates absorb the most field particles . the total mass in the size of computational domain increases as @xmath93 increases .",
    "therefore the mass of the largest aggregate is larger for larger @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath80 is large , the collision frequency is large , and accumulation is efficient .",
    "the mutual gravitational force is stronger for larger @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the growth of the aggregates is more efficient if @xmath84 and @xmath80 are larger .",
    "the mass of the largest aggregate is independent of @xmath19 and @xmath130 .",
    "the physical size of the largest aggregate is smaller for larger @xmath130 since the restoring force is weaker for larger @xmath130 .    in order to make the simulation of a self - gravitating dust layer feasible , we had to adopt some simplification and approximation in the present paper .",
    "we used the  super particle \" in the present simulation .",
    "the super particles represent the group of small dust particles .",
    "we assumed that the super particles obey the simple collision model analogous to that of the small dust particles .",
    "the restitution coefficient @xmath19 used in this simulation is not the physical restitution coefficient , but corresponds to the rate of the dissipation due to collisions between super particles .",
    "thus , the study of the collision law between super particles and its validity remains to be done .",
    "unfortunately , the simulation of a self - gravitating dust layer using real - scale dust particles is beyond the ability of today s supercomputers .",
    "we used smaller @xmath227 than the realistic @xmath216 .",
    "we checked that the formation process is common for @xmath227 , and investigated its dependence on @xmath84 .",
    "however , it is necessary to test the model with large @xmath84 to confirm whether our results can be applied to a realistic formation scenario or not",
    ". we will examine this problem in the near future .",
    "we found that the masses of planetesimals increase with the size of computational domain in our calculation .",
    "we did not observe the saturation of this mass increase .",
    "if the saturation does not occur in the actual formation process , the protoplanets can be formed directly through gi .",
    "we need to perform the simulation with a much larger size of the computational domain to discuss the saturation of the planetesimal growth .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we neglected the effect of gas in our simulation .",
    "however , the effect of gas is not negligible if the dust size is smaller than about @xmath228 m and is important for the scenario of the formation of planetesimals .",
    "many authors have investigated the effect of gas : the solid particles drift radially due to gas drag @xcite , angular momentum dissipation helps gravitational collapse @xcite , gas turbulence prevents and helps concentrating solids @xcite , and the clumps of solid particles are formed due to drag instability @xcite . in addition , the effect of gas must be important for the nonlinear process of the gravitational instability . if the gas is laminar and the turbulence is sufficiently week , the drag force dissipate the kinetic energy of dust particles .",
    "this effect helps gi . on the other hand ,",
    "if the turbulence of gas is strong , the dust particles are stirred up and the kinetic energy increases .",
    "this effect prevents gi .",
    "we expect that the criterion and nonlinear process of gi depend on the size of the dust particles and the strength of the turbulence .",
    "we will examine the conditions of gravitational instability and formation process of planetesimals in a turbulent gas disk in near future .",
