    "form factors characterise the internal structure of subatomic particles and , in particular , electromagnetic probes of hadrons provide important information on the underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom . in the nonperturbative regime ( i.e. , at low momentum transfer ) , qcd - motivated , effective hadronic models continue to play an important role in analyzing and understanding a wealth of experimental data .",
    "the mit bag model@xcite was an early attempt to include the key features of confinement and asymptotic freedom in a quark based model of hadronic structure .",
    "the cloudy bag model ( cbm)@xcite improves on the mit bag model significantly by introducing an elementary pion field coupled to the quarks inside the bag such that chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the introduction of the pion field not only improves the static nucleon properties , but also provides a convenient connection to the study of conventional intermediate energy physics such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering .",
    "there are many calculations of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors within different hadronic models . indeed",
    "the understanding of these form factors is extremely important in any effective theory or model of the strong interaction .",
    "however , there is , to our knowledge , no truly satisfactory means of forming fully lorentz covariant momentum eigenstates from any static model . in this work",
    "we suggest an improved treatment ( a hybrid method of galilean momentum projection combined with an appropriate lorentz contraction ) for a model which has been widely used for many years  the cbm , and bring it to larger momentum transfers .",
    "the present results not only remind us of the effectiveness of chiral quark models at moderate momentum transfer , but also remind us that they can serve as an essential first step in the investigation of the electromagnetic interaction in quark based nuclear models , in particular , the electromagnetic interaction in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model@xcite .    in the cbm , as in the mit bag model , quarks are independent particles confined in a rigid spherical well . the bag model wave function for a baryon is a direct product of individual quark wave functions , analogous to nuclear shell model wave functions . a static bag can not carry a definite momentum and so bag - model baryon states are not total momentum eigenstates , in spite of the fact that the hamiltonian commutes with the total momentum operator .",
    "matrix elements evaluated between such states contain spurious center of mass motion .",
    "this defect compromises some of the predictive power of the model , such that only observables involved in very low - momentum transfer processes ( @xmath2 ) are typically assumed to be reliable .    over the years",
    ", a number of prescriptions for the correction of the center of mass motion have been developed ( for an overview , see for example refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the diversity of approaches may be viewed as an indication of the uncertainty associated with this correction .",
    "in contrast to the nonrelativistic case , the internal motion of a composite object can not be explicitly separated from the collective motion in a covariant description . for",
    "the calculation of the form factors , a satisfactory treatment may result from a combination of relativistic boost , momentum projection , and a variational procedure .",
    "betz and goldflam@xcite argued that a static soliton bag can be boosted consistently to a soliton bag moving with a finite velocity .",
    "however this approach is impractical for boosting the mit bag because of the sharp surface which prevents the construction of a simple boost operator@xcite . a number of nonrelativistic methods for the center of mass correction exist in the literature@xcite .",
    "analytic forms of the recoil corrections can be obtained in a relativitic harmonic oscillator quark model@xcite .",
    "unfortunately different groups do not always agree with each other and sometimes even result in a correction with the opposite sign .    in this work we compare several intuitively simple momentum - projection procedures for the calculation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the basic idea is to extract the momentum eigenstates from the static solutions by appropriate linear superpositions .",
    "the simplest prescription for this approach was proposed by peierls and yoccoz ( py)@xcite .",
    "we will assume that a baryon is composed of three constituents .",
    "hence the wave function for a moving baryon with total momentum @xmath3 is constructed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a momentum dependent normalization constant .",
    "the localized state is simply given by a product of the three individual quark wavefunctions , @xmath6 where @xmath7 refers to the location of the centre of the static bag , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 specify the positions of the three constituent quarks . with the py wave function , the predictions of the static baryon properties are generally improved@xcite .",
    "it reduces the r.m.s .",
    "radius , increases @xmath11 , and on the whole produces a better mass spectrum .",
    "however , it is unreliable for calculations of dynamic observables which involve large momentum transfers , sine the py wave function does not transform appropriately under lorentz boosts . a closely related method for eliminating the center of mass motion",
    "is called the peierls - thouless ( pt ) projection@xcite . there the wave function is constructed through one further linear superposition in terms of the py wavefunction , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the center of mass of the baryon ( we assume equal mass quarks here ) .",
    "ideally the weight function , @xmath14 , should be chosen to minimize the total energy , but this is quite complicated to implement in practice .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we make the choice @xmath15 for simplicity and convenience .",
    "then integrations over @xmath7 and @xmath16 can be carried out explicitly .",
    "this leads to a comparatively simple pt wave function for the baryon , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is determined by the requirement that it satisfy the normalization condition @xmath19 with @xmath20 for the nonrelativistic normalization and @xmath21 if we wish to adopt a standard relativistic normalization for the baryon wavefunction .",
    "notice that the above methods of momentum projection act only on the center of mass coordinate and the individual quark wavefunctions are not affected . however , since baryons are composite objects , once they have nonzero momentum , their internal structure should be subsequently modified .",
    "for example , the bag surface is no longer spherical in the breit frame , rather it should be contracted along the direction of motion .",
    "we take care of this effect in terms of the prescprition by licht and pagnamenta@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the present work is the first presentation of calculations of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors using the cbm , besides the obvious improvement of the treatment .",
