    "it is well known that black hole x - ray binaries show two basic spectral states : the high / soft state appearing at high luminosities ( typically 10% @xmath12 , where @xmath12 is the eddington luminosity ) and the low / hard spectral state at low luminosities , typically a few percent of @xmath12 , by factors of a few smaller than that of the high / soft state ( mcconnell et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the high / soft state x - ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal soft x - ray component of temperature , @xmath13 kev , associated with a weak steep power - law component with photon index @xmath142 . in the low / hard state ,",
    "on the other hand , spectra are mainly composed of comptonized emission components in the hard x - ray band , soft excess components , and reflection components from the optically thick cold medium ( for recent reviews , see mcclintock & remillard 2003 ; done et al .",
    "while the high / soft state is reasonably well understood in terms of the standard disk model ( see , e.g. makishima et al .",
    "1986 ) , the nature of the accretion flow in the low / hard state is still a matter of debate .",
    "historically , two classes of models have been considered : the inner hot flow model and the disk corona model ( thorne & price 1975 ; shapiro et al .",
    "1976 ; liang & price 1977 ; for a recent review of theoretical models , see kato et al . 2008 ) . in the inner hot flow model , an optically thick disk is radially truncated at some radius , @xmath15 , and the central region , @xmath16 , is filled with a hot flow , which produces hard x - rays by means of the inverse compton scattering of soft photons .",
    "the properties of the hot flow are modeled by an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , or more generally , radiatively inefficient accretion flow , riaf ) , in which most of the energy released via viscous dissipation remains in the accreting gas rather than being radiated away ( ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al . 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the adaf solution can exist only below a critical accretion rate , which depends on the viscosity parameter @xmath17 ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "some authors calculated the radiative spectra from pure adafs or riafs by global monte carlo calculations ( e.g. kurpiewski & jaroszynski 1999 ; kato et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the disk truncation is suggested by a number of observations .",
    "the soft excess component in the low / hard state is generally attributed to soft thermal emission from optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk ( bauciska - church et al .",
    "1995 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 ) . by spectral fitting of the soft thermal component to disk - blackbody ( mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) , the inner radius of the thin disk seems to be truncated at some outer radii , @xmath18 schwarzschild radii ( makishima et al .",
    "2008 ; gierliski et al . 2008 ) .",
    "moreover the low / hard state spectrum shows a relatively small solid angle , @xmath19 , subtended by the reflector derived from the reflection component ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; gilfanov et al .",
    "this implies that the interface between the hot flow and the cool disk has rather small area .",
    "one plausible explanation is that the inner part of the cool disk is truncated at some radius in the low / hard state .",
    "the disk truncation is also suggested by the variability study .",
    "the power density spectrum of the x - ray emission shows a typical break frequency ( miyamoto et al .",
    "as the spectrum evolves harder , the frequency becomes smaller ( ibragimov et al . 2005 ; axelsson et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this would imply that the inner radius of the disk is far from the radius of the marginally stable orbit in the low / hard state , given that the typical frequency is related to the motion of the inner edge of the disk .    in the disk corona model , by contrast , the optically thick disk remains untruncated , and hard x - rays are generated in a hot corona .",
    "it is commonly assumed that a substantial fraction of the gravitational accreting energy is dissipated in the corona , although the physical processes by which the corona is heated are still unknown .",
    "magnetic fields amplified inside the disk could dissipate above the disk surface , where the density is relatively low , making an active hot corona ( galeev et al . 1979 ; haardt & maraschi 1991 ; di matteo 1998 ; merloni 2003 ) .",
    "the situation may be similar to the case of the solar corona .",
    "liu et al . ( 2003 ) solved the radial structure of magnetically heated corona and calculated the emergent spectra by summing up the radiation from the plane - parallel corona at each radius .",
    "the corona could also be heated by the accretion of the coronal gas itself ( liu et al .",
    "kawanaka et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studied the structure of the hot flow by using non - radiative mhd simulation data , identifying it as a corona .",
    "they calculated self - consistent electron temperature and the emergent spectra by a global monte carlo calculation .",
    "more recently , however , it is suggested by the suzaku observations that the situation may be more complex .",
    "takahashi et al . ( 2008 ) and makishima et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the hard x - ray continua of gro j1655 - 40 and cyg x-1 are better fitted by two thermal comptonization components , rather than by single component .",
    "the existence of the two comptonized components in the hard x - ray band has already been previously reported ( gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ; ibragimov et al .",
    "these would imply a possibility that a hot gas generating hard x - ray photons has a complicated structure with multiple values of electron temperature and/or optical depth .",
    "another possibility of the origin of the two comptonized components is a time - dependent effect ( poutanen & fabian 1999 ; takahashi et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the former case and neglect the properties of the time variability .",
    "though there are plenty of models for the hard x - ray spectra in the low / hard states , none of them can reproduce the two power - law components so far .",
    "especially the reproduction of the two power - law components is a theoretically challenging subject . in this paper",
    "we investigate the structure and the emergent spectra of accretion flow for a variety of geometries of hot and cool accretion flows , instead of focusing on the detailed physical mechanisms making such accretion geometries , to examine which model can well explain the basic spectral properties of black holes during the low / hard state . here",
    "we consider steady models and neglect non - thermal electrons which would explain the mev tail in the low / hard state spectra .",
    "we will show that the combination of the inner hot flow model and disk corona model can naturally reproduce the two power - law components .",
    "in section [ sec : model ] we present our models used for the spectrum calculations and details of the numerical method .",
    "then we present the results of the emergent spectra in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "we discuss on the obtained results and applications for observation in section [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "finally , we give conclusions of this paper in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the present study , we aim at construction of accretion models which satisfy the basic spectral properties of the low / hard state . for this purpose",
    "we set the following three criteria for successful models for the low / hard state spectra ( done et al . 2007 ; makishima et al . 2008 )",
    ": + ( i ) the hard x - ray luminosity ( at photon energy above 3kev ) , @xmath20 , should exceed the soft x - ray luminosity ( below 3kev ) , @xmath21 .",
    "+ ( ii ) the hard x - ray luminosity should be in the range of @xmath22 for black hole mass of @xmath23 . + ( iii ) the spectrum should exhibit two power - law components which are dominant above and below @xmath24kev , @xmath25 , where @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) is the power - law index in the softer ( harder ) energy bands .    other prominent properties of the low / hard state , e.g.",
    "mev tales in the spectra and time - lags in fourier space , are not considered in this paper .",
    "we consider three representative models for the configuration of hot and cool flows ( see figure [ fig : geometry ] )",
    ". generally speaking , hot and cool flows are expected to interact with each other by many different ways ; e.g. energy exchange via radiation , conduction , and magnetic fields , mass exchange via evaporation or condensation , and so on .    here , we focus on the radiative interaction of the flows and do not explicitly consider thermal conduction nor solve the dynamics of magnetic fields . though there are some attempts for calculating the mass evaporation / condensation process between the hot flow and the cool thin disk ( e.g. , raska & czerny 2000 ; spruit & deufel 2002 ; liu et al .",
    "2007 ; qiao & liu 2009 ) , we do not follow them since there exist uncertainties in the treatments , but instead incorporate the effects of matter exchange by changing the accretion rate within the cool and hot flows .",
    "the exchanges of the energy and angular momentum between the two phases ( other than the energy exchange via radiation ) are not considered in the present study .",
    "the effects of wind mass loss from the hot flow will be discussed in section [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "the basic assumptions for each of the three models are as follows : + model ( a ) : inner hot flow model    in this model we postulate that a standard thin disk surrounds an inner hot adaf .",
    "we assume that the material in the outer thin disk suddenly evaporates to the adaf at the transition radius , @xmath26 , so that the transition zone between the outer thin disk and the inner adaf is sufficiently narrow .",
    "the accretion rate of the inner adaf , @xmath27 , is assumed to be the same as that of the outer thin disk , @xmath28 , and these values are assumed to be radially constant , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the total accretion rate of the hot flow and cool flow .",
    "some fraction of the soft photons emitted from the thin disk is captured by the adaf and cools the adaf , especially near the transition radius , but only a small fraction of the hard photons generated by compton up - scattering in the adaf is caught by the outer thin disk because of the small cross section of the thin disk .",
    "the reprocessed radiation is thus expected to be weak .",
    "+ model ( b ) : disk corona model    in this model we consider two - temperature , accreting coronae above and below a thin cool disk .",
    "the corona is powered by the release of the gravitational energy by accretion itself .",
    "the thin disk extends down to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the non - spinning black hole space - time , @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that the accretion rate of the corona , @xmath32 , and that of the underneath thin disk , @xmath28 , are both constant in space . since the hot corona covers the whole thin disk , we expect that most of soft photons emitted from the thin disk experience scattering in the coronae and that a large fraction of the hard photons generated in the coronae are reprocessed by the thin disk .",
    "this makes a big contrast with the case of the inner hot flow model ( a ) .",
    "+ model ( c ) : hybrid model    we finally consider a hybrid model of models ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the outer part has a disk - corona structure , which is , however , truncated at some radius , @xmath26 , and the flow becomes pure adaf inside this radius .",
    "the mass accretion rate of the inner adaf is a sum of that of the outer corona and the thin disk , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that these values are constant in space unless specified otherwise .",
    "note that similar configurations were considered in some previous studies , though the structure of the hot flow was assumed to be uniform ( e.g. poutanen et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "( 90mm,90mm)figure1.eps      in order to calculate the emergent spectra , we need to solve the radial structure of the adaf , the corona , and the thin disk .",
    "note that what matters in the thin disk part is only the radial profile of the soft photon emissivity ( or more precisely , the energy dissipation rate as a function of the radius ) and it can be easily derived from the standard disk theory once an accretion rate is specified . as for the structure of the adaf and corona",
    "we adopt the technique used for the self - similar solution of the advection - dominated flow ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "note , however , that the adaf and the corona show somewhat different temperature profiles since the amount of soft radiation available for compton cooling differs .    in a realistic situation , dynamics of the magnetic fields and the way of interactions with the thin disk ( via , e.g. , thermal conduction and/or convective motions",
    ") could be markedly different in the corona and the adaf .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of the present study and are left as future issues .    throughout the present study",
    "we adopt the newtonian dynamics and assume an axisymmetric and steady flow structure in the newtonian gravitational potential , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the black hole mass .",
    "we neglect the radiative force on the adaf / corona , since the hot flow is optically thin and the typical luminosity is sub - eddington .",
    "we further assume that the accreting gas is composed of two - temperature plasmas of fully ionized hydrogen .",
    "electron - positron pairs are not considered .    here the blackbody emission from the thin disk is assumed to be the source of soft photons and we neglect seed photons generated by synchrotron emission .",
    "note that the synchrotron emission would be weak in a pure thermal plasma ( wardziski & zdziarski 2000 ) .",
    "however the synchrotron emission would provide enough soft photons for the low / hard spectrum , if mev(non - thermal ) tail exists in the electron distribution , which is required in order to explain the observed spectrum in mev band .",
    "( wardziski & zdziarski 2001 ; malzac & belmont 2009 ; poutanen & vurm 2009 ) .",

    "we assume vertically uniform structure of the adaf / corona within the half thickness , @xmath40 .",
    "hence the surface density is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number density of protons , and the mass accretion rate of the adaf(or corona ) is @xmath43 .",
    "we obtain azimuthal velocity from the radial momentum equation , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is keplerian velocity and the last term is radial pressure gradient . in this paper we neglect radial inertial term for simplicity . it should be noted that this term contributes at most @xmath46 of the @xmath47 in equation ( [ eq : radial ] ) even for @xmath48 , which we adopt for reproducing the observational results .",
    "the angular momentum equation is @xmath49 where we assume that the @xmath50-@xmath51 component of the viscous stress tensor , @xmath52 , is dominant and other components are negligible .",
    "we make the ansatz that the stress tensor scales with the local gas pressure with a constant of proportionality , @xmath53 . in order to solve the dynamical properties of the flow , we assume that the adaf and the corona have self - similar structures , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that the electrons and protons are thermodynamically coupled only through coulomb coupling , neglecting poorly understood direct heating processes of electrons via magnetic fields .",
    "the energy balance between protons and electrons are , respectively , @xmath56 where the first two terms on left - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : proton ] ) represent advective cooling and the term on right - hand - side is viscous heating . here an additional heating at the transition radius is not considered ( manmoto & kato 2000 ) .",
    "we also assume that an advective term of electrons is negligible ( see nakamura et al .",
    "this means that the electron cooling timescale is much shorter than the accretion timescale , @xmath57 .",

    "we employ logarithmically spaced 100 grid points to describe the properties of the adaf , the corona , and the thin disk .",

    "we calculated the expected spectra from the black hole accretion flows with three different flow geometries .",

    "the former produces the softer power - law component with @xmath9 , while the latter generates the harder one with @xmath194 .",
    "( ii ) the spectrum is dominated by hard x - ray radiation because of less soft photons originating from the outer thin disk impinging the two hot zone ( i.e. , we find less dissipated energy in the thin disk compared to the inner hot flow case and less reprocessed radiation compared to the disk corona case ) . when the number of the soft photons is small , the soft thermal emission becomes weak and the comptonization in the hot zone becomes very efficient since @xmath7 is moderately large ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "when the optical depth is much smaller than unity , for a moderately large @xmath195 , the electron temperature should be very high , @xmath196 .",
    "however , the resulting spectrum does not show a simple power - law component with such a high electron temperature ( see figure [ fig : corona]b ) .    therefore the spectrum can have a strong power - law component only for a moderately large optical depth , @xmath197 . since the optical depth of the hot advection - dominated flow",
    "is given by @xmath198 , the smaller @xmath17 is , the larger becomes the optical depth for a given accretion rate .",
    "however the solution of advection - dominated flow exists only when the mass accretion rate is smaller than critical value , @xmath199 ( narayan et al . 1995 ; abramowicz et al . 1995 ) . hence the maximum optical depth is larger for larger @xmath17 , @xmath200 , and",
    "large @xmath201 is necessary for a moderately large optical depth of the hot flow , @xmath202 , to be realized ( zdziarski 1998 ) .",

    "local radiative mhd simulation shows magnetically dominated corona forming above the thin disk ( miller & stone 2000 ; hirose et al .",
    "moreover , when the hot flow collapses in the vertical direction by radiative cooling , we could expect a magnetically supported accretion flow ( machida et al .",
    "2006 ; oda et al .",

    "the effective @xmath17 could be large , @xmath204 , though our model does not take into account the magnetic processes explicitly , and the @xmath17 prescription might not be relevant in such a low @xmath205 region .      since the hard x - ray photons are emitted from the adaf / corona regions where the advection fraction is almost unity , the radiative efficiency of the flow we consider is very small , @xmath206 .",
    "this conclusion would be changed , if there are direct heating of electrons by magnetic processes , in addition to the electron heating by the coulomb collisions with protons .",

    "if a significant fraction of energy released in the outer thin disk is dissipated in the inner adaf region , the radiative efficiency of the thin disk can be sufficiently small @xmath207 , and that of the adaf becomes large @xmath208 . as a result ,",

    "( 1997 ) considered similar situation and claimed that inner hot flow model can basically explain the low / hard state spectra .    in the disk corona case ,",
    "on the other hand , the conclusion that soft x - ray luminosity is always dominant is hardly affected by the heating process of the corona .",
    "even if all of the accretion energy of the disk and corona is released by the hard x - ray radiation in the corona , half of the hard x - rays is reprocessed by the thin disk .",

    "note that there is another explanation of the origin of the two power - law components .",
    "it is well known that the spectrum varies on short time scales .",
    "it is possible that two power - law components could be artificially generated because of the time average in the long observational time .",
    "if one tries to explains also time lags , then one would have to conclude that either the local spectrum is pivoting due to evolution of the geometry of the energy dissipation region ( poutanen & fabian 1999 ) , or the spectrum changing because at different distances from the black hole the spectrum of the hot flow is different and it is harder closer in ( kotov et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we evaluate the soft thermal component from the thin disk , including the reprocessed radiation .",
    "it should be noted that the spectrum of the soft photons in our model is significantly different from the disk - blackbody spectrum with an accretion rate of @xmath28 .",
    "rather it exhibits a high effective temperature ( or large spectral hardening factor , @xmath221 ) , because the contribution of the reprocessed radiation of the hard x - ray from the adaf / corona is large ( typically @xmath222 of the soft photons ) .",
    "hence , the simple estimation of the inner disk radius by the disk - blackbody model would underestimate the actual disk radius ( gierliski et al .",

    "we find that the spectra show very different spectral features for various ratios of the accretion rate of the corona to that of the thin disk , even when the total accretion rate is kept constant .",
    "the larger @xmath110 is , the larger becomes the fraction of hard x - rays ( see figure [ fig : hybrid2p]a ) .",
    "this implies that a change in the ratio of the accretion rate may trigger a transition of the spectral state , even when the total mass accretion rate is nearly kept constant . note",
    "that our model produce a thermal cut - off in the power - law component around @xmath193 kev .",
    "thus the non - thermal electrons would be necessary for the spectrum in the high / soft state , and also in the low / hard state if the observed radiation in the mev band comes from the accretion flow ( li et al .",

    "the electron temperature expected by our model ( typically 200 - 300kev ) is somewhat higher than that estimated by the cut - off energy of the hard x - ray spectrum ( @xmath223100kev ) .",
    "this is because , even though the viscosity parameter is large , @xmath204 , and the mass accretion rate is its maximum value @xmath109 , the optical depth of the adaf is still somewhat smaller than unity , resulting in high electron temperature in order to keep large compton @xmath7-parameter , @xmath195 ( zdziarski 1998 ) .",
    "the optical depth of the electron - positron pairs could contribute to lower the electron temperature , since the compactness parameter around the black hole in the low / hard state is expected to be large , @xmath224 where we set the typical size of the emitting region , @xmath225 .",
    "the newly found solutions , luminous hot accretion flows , might also be appropriate , since they have large optical depth and low electron temperatures , compared with adafs for a given @xmath7 ( yuan 2003 ; yuan & zdziarski 2004 ) , though they might be thermally unstable .",
    "moreover thermal synchrotron emission would play a role as a cooling mechanism of the electrons , in addition to a role as a source of the soft photons .",
    "we find that the hybrid model with the parameters used in this paper can marginally agree with the relatively faint low / hard state ( @xmath226 ) .",

    "we simply give the transition radius and mass accretion rate as free parameters .",
    "however these values seem to depend on the compton cooling rate in the disk evaporation model ( liu et al .",
    "hence we have to solve the whole of the structure , taking in to account the gas evaporation / condensation process and radiative transfer self - consistently .",
    "in addition we used the self - similar solution for adaf / corona , which would be invalid near the black holes where boundary conditions become essential ( nakamura et al .",
    "1996 ; manmoto et al . 1997",
    "; narayan et al . 1997 ) . for further studies",
    ", we should include general relativistic effect into both accretion structure and radiative transfer ( doppler beaming by the gas motion and bending of the photon trajectory ) , in order to include the radiative contribution from the plunging region where the bulk comptonization would also be important .",

    "<S> to understand the origin of hard x - ray emissions from black hole x - ray binaries during their low / hard states , we calculate the x - ray spectra of black - hole accretion flow for the following three configurations of hot and cool media : ( a ) an inner hot flow and a cool outer disk ( inner hot flow model ) , ( b ) a cool disk sandwiched by disk coronae ( disk corona model ) , and ( c ) the combination of those two ( hybrid model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the basic features we require for successful models are ( i ) significant hard x - ray emission whose luminosity exceeds that of soft x - rays , ( ii ) high hard x - ray luminosities in the range of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 , and ( iii ) the existence of two power - law components in the hard x - ray band with the photon indices of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the photon indices of the softer ( @xmath5 kev ) and the harder ( @xmath6 kev ) power - law components , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> contribution by non - thermal electrons nor time - dependent evolution are not considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find that models ( a ) and ( b ) can be ruled out , since the spectra are always dominated by the soft component , and since only one power - law component , at most , can be reproduced </S>",
    "<S> . only model ( c ) can account for sufficiently strong hard x - ray emissions , as well as the existence of the two power - law components , for a large ratio of the accretion rate in the corona to that in the thin disk . </S>",
    "<S> the outer disk corona ( where the compton @xmath7-parameter is smaller , @xmath8 ) produces the softer power - law component with photon index of @xmath9 , whereas the inner hot flow ( where @xmath10 ) generates the harder component with @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this model can also account for the observed relationship between the photon index and the reflection fraction . </S>"
