    "in the first five runs  ( 20002005 ) of the relativistic heavy ion collider  ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , the phobos experiment  @xcite has collected data from 4 collision systems  ( p+p , d+au , cu+cu and au+au ) in a wide range of collision energies  ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5  gev ) . to a large extent ,",
    "analyses of this dataset dealt with the global properties of charged particle production .",
    "recent results in this area extend the measurement of midrapidity charged particle multiplicity in au+au collisions to lower centrality , enabling a better overlap in @xmath6 with the cu+cu system and include the analysis of the @xmath7 for all cu+cu energies , including the lowest energy data at @xmath8 gev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also obtained preliminary results on elliptic flow  @xcite in cu+cu collisions at @xmath8 gev , completing our set of measurements on elliptic flow at rhic for cu+cu and au+au collisions at all available energies  @xcite .",
    "the final results for charged particle production down to very low transverse momenta in au+au collisions at @xmath9 gev  @xcite , as well as preliminary measurements of antiparticle to particle ratios  @xcite in cu+cu collisions have been obtained .",
    "a completely new analysis of charged two - particle angular correlations has been developed that fully utilizes the extensive coverage in pseudorapidity  ( @xmath10 ) and azimuthal angle  ( @xmath11 ) provided by the phobos multiplicity  ( octagon ) detector and its corresponding ability to measure the full bulk of charged particle emission down to very low momentum .",
    "studies related to this analysis initially have focused on the short - range correlations in pseudorapidity .",
    "preliminary results for cu+cu  @xcite and final results for p+p  @xcite have recently been reported .",
    "since the start of the rhic program , studies of collective phenomena via the measurement of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles have been one of the most important probes of the dynamics of nucleus  nucleus collisions . in particular ,",
    "elliptic flow is sensitive to the early stages of the collision and its study provides unique insights into the properties of the hot , dense matter that is produced in these collisions . at the root of the interpretation of elliptic flow lies the connection to the initial overlap geometry of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the azimuthal spatial asymmetry of the almond - shaped overlap region can only be reflected in the azimuthal distribution of detected particles if the produced particles do significantly interact already shortly after the initial production . at top rhic energy ,",
    "a large elliptic flow  ( @xmath12 ) signal near midrapidity has been observed  @xcite .",
    "its magnitude is found to be in agreement with hydrodynamical model calculations of a relativistic hydrodynamic fluid which supports the current view that a strongly interacting state of matter is produced early in the collision process .",
    "one of the primary motivations of colliding cu+cu and au+au nuclei at rhic was to enable a detailed study of the effect of system size on all measurable physics observables .",

    "two important features are immediately evident .",
    "first , the magnitude of flow in the smaller cu+cu system is large and qualitatively follows a similar trend with centrality as seen in the larger au+au system .",
    "second , even for the most central collisions in cu+cu , the magnitude of @xmath12 is substantial , and exceeds that seen in central au+au collisions .",

    "the eccentricity  ( @xmath20 ) of the overlap region can be estimated with the collection of participating nucleons .",
    "there are several definitions for calculating @xmath20 , two of which are illustrated in .",
    "on the left , a schematic depiction of the `` standard '' ( top , @xmath21 ) and `` participant '' ( bottom , @xmath22 ) methods are shown . the former calculates the eccentricity of the overlap region assuming that the minor axis of the overlap region is aligned along the impact parameter .",
    "the impact parameter and the beam direction define the _ nuclear reaction plane_. however , fluctuations in the nucleon interaction points frequently create a situation where the minor axis of the overlap ellipse is not aligned with the impact parameter vector . the participant eccentricity definition  @xcite accounts for this by quantifying the eccentricity with respect to the major axes of the overlap ellipse .",

    "the apparent relevance of the participant eccentricity model in unifying the average elliptic flow results for cu+cu and au+au collisions leads naturally to consideration of the dynamical fluctuations of both the participant eccentricity itself as well as in the measured elliptic flow signal from data .",
    "simulations of the expected dynamical fluctuations in participant eccentricity as a function of @xmath6 were performed using the phobos monte carlo glauber based participant eccentricity model , and they predict large dynamical fluctuations , @xmath32 of the order of 0.4 in au+au collisions at @xmath33 gev .",
    "there are several different approaches one could develop to measure dynamical elliptic flow fluctuations .",
    "phobos has recently created a new method that is based on a direct measure of @xmath12 on an event - by - event basis using a maximum likelihood fit assuming that the shape of @xmath12 in pseudo - rapidity is either triangular or trapezoidal and that utilizes the unique large pseudorapidity coverage of the phobos detector  @xcite .",
    "the strength of this approach lies in the fact that this analysis removes the effects of statistical fluctuations and multiplicity dependence by applying a detailed model of the detector response that enables both a measurement of the average @xmath12 on an event - by - event basis as well as a measure of the dynamical fluctuations in @xmath12 .",
    "the experimental results for both the average @xmath34 and the measured dynamical fluctuations @xmath29 , which we also quantify using the ratio @xmath31 , obtained in this new analysis are given in for au+au collisions at @xmath13 = 200 gev  @xcite .",

    "systematics on the experimental measurement are decreased by quantifying the result as a ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "we observe large dynamical fluctuations in elliptic flow with a magnitude in remarkable agreement with calculations of participant eccentricity fluctuations .",
    "the observed agreement suggests that the fluctuations of elliptic flow primarily reflect fluctuations in the initial state geometry and are not affected strongly by the latter stages of the collision .",
    "note that the systematic errors imposed in our results include estimates from non - flow contributions to the observed magnitude of the flow fluctuations that rely on a description of non - flow effects in hijing .",
