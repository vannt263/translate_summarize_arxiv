    "beginning with an investigation of the spherically symmetric collapse of a massless scalar field  @xcite , many studies of gravitational collapse have established that the threshold of black hole formation is characterized by critical phenomena analogous to those that accompany phase transitions in statistical mechanical systems .",
    "briefly , ( for a detailed review , see  @xcite ) , black - hole threshold phenomena arise from the consideration of families of spacetimes , ( generally containing one or more matter fields ) , which are labeled by a family parameter , @xmath3 , that controls the degree of self - gravitation in the spacetime .",
    "these families typically describe the implosion of an initially in - going concentration of matter - energy . for small values of @xmath3 , the energy implodes in an essentially linear fashion , re - emerges and",
    "disperses to large distances .",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath3 , the implosion results in black hole formation , with some fraction of the initial mass of the system trapped within a horizon .",
    "the threshold of black hole formation is defined by the specific ( critical ) parameter value , @xmath4 , at which a black hole first makes an appearance .",
    "empirically , and quite generically , a number of intriguing features are seen in the near - critical regime .",
    "these include the emergence of specific critical solutions with scaling , or time - translational , symmetries , scaling laws of dimensionful quantities such as the black - hole mass , and universality in the sense that these features do not depend on the details of the family used to generate the critical solution .",
    "there is now a relatively complete , though non - rigorous , understanding of this phenomenology .",
    "first , for a given matter model and symmetry restrictions ( spherical , or axial symmetry for example ) , the black hole threshold apparently defines specific solutions of the coupled matter - einstein equations .",
    "these solutions are essentially unique , up to certain rescalings , or at least are isolated in the overall solution space of the model .",
    "second , these critical solutions , although unstable essentially by construction , tend to be minimally unstable in the sense of possessing a single ( or perhaps a few ) unstable modes in perturbation theory .",
    "the lyapunov exponents associated with these modes can be immediately related to the exponents determined from empirically measured scaling laws .",
    "in this paper we study the critical collapse of a massless spin-@xmath0 dirac field coupled to the general relativistic gravitational field , within the context of spherical symmetry .",
    "since a single spinor field can not be spherically symmetric , we consider the incoherent sum of two independent fields so that the superposition has no net spin - angular momentum . through direct solution of the 1 + 1 dimensional pdes governing the dynamics",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of so - called type ii behavior in the model , in which black hole formation turns on at infinitesimal mass , and the critical solution is self - similar . in the current instance , the self - similarity is somewhat novel in that individual components of the dirac field are discretely self - similar , but the overall geometry is continuously self - similar . as expected for this type of critical solution , we find a black hole mass - scaling law for solutions in the super - critical regime .",
    "we then directly construct the threshold solution using an appropriate self - similar ansatz for the geometry and matter fields and demonstrate , good agreement between it and the pde solution .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric system of spin-@xmath0 fields .",
    "we use the adm formalism ( see @xcite for details ) , adopt units in which @xmath5 , and express the metric in polar - areal coordinates : @xmath6 the coordinate @xmath7 is the _ areal _ radius defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the proper area of a constant-@xmath7 @xmath10-sphere .",
    "the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are to be determined using a subset of the @xmath13 form of einstein s equations , as described in more detail in section  [ sec : geometry ] .    before discussing how we separate the radial and angular dependences in our system to form a spin singlet",
    ", we begin with a brief review of spinors in curved spacetime ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of a massless , spin-@xmath0 field coupled to gravity is governed by the curved space dirac equation : @xmath14 the curved space @xmath15-matrices , @xmath16 satisfy @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 identity matrix and @xmath20 is the inverse metric . in flat spacetime , we have : @xmath21 a particular choice of @xmath22 that satisfy ( [ clifflat ] ) with our metric signature @xmath23 is : @xmath24 here , the index @xmath25 ranges over the spatial values @xmath26 and the @xmath27 are the pauli spin matrices , namely @xmath28 the general @xmath15-matrices are related to their flat , cartesian counterparts by @xmath29 where there is an implied summation over the values @xmath30 of the `` flat '' , latin index @xmath31 , and the @xmath32 are known as vierbein .",
    "the derivative operator in equation ( [ dirac ] ) is a _",
    "covariant derivative with spinor affine connections , @xmath33 .",
    "it acts in the following way on spinors , @xmath34 and on @xmath15-matrices , @xmath35 however , it reduces to the usual covariant derivative when acting on tensors .",
    "we choose the spinor connections so that @xmath36 it can then be shown that the @xmath37 take the form @xmath38 { v_a{}^\\nu}\\nabla_{\\mu}v_{b\\nu}.\\ ] ] we also note that when taking the covariant derivative of the vierbein , @xmath39 , only one christoffel connection appears , since there is only one curved , tensor ( greek ) index .",
    "having fixed the form of the spherically symmetric metric ( [ metric ] ) , we are ready to find a set of @xmath15-matrices that satisfy equation ( [ clifford ] ) .",
    "we choose as our representation : @xmath40 @xmath41 the spinor connections are @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where dots and primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "we note that we have complete freedom to choose any set of @xmath16 we wish provided they satisfy equation ( [ clifford ] ) , and that our specific choice is made so that the dirac equation can be easily separated into radial and angular parts .    before proceeding to this separation",
    ", we introduce a further simplification based on the fact that we are dealing with a massless spin-@xmath0 field .",
    "mathematically , such a field has a particular chirality ( circular polarization ) ; we adopt left - handed chirality which is expressed as : @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 equation ( [ chiral ] ) can be satisfied by taking @xmath50 substitution of this form for the spinor into equation ( [ dirac ] ) yields two identical sets of equations , each coupling the spinor components , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we of course only need to solve one set of equations for these variables , so we are left with two equations instead of the original four .",
    "we now perform a separation of variables on the spinor components by writing : @xmath53 with this new choice of variables , and with our previously chosen representation of the @xmath54  ( [ myrep ] ) , the dirac equation separates into a part that depends on @xmath55 ( which we will refer to as the `` radial '' part ) , and a part that depends on @xmath56 : @xmath57 we note that although the factor @xmath58 in  ( [ split ] ) is not necessary for the separation of variables , it simplifies matters by reducing the number of terms in the resulting equation .",
    "of particular importance is the elimination of a time derivative of @xmath12 that would make numerical solution of the resulting system of pdes somewhat more involved .",
    "considering our separated equation , we observe that since any change in @xmath59 or @xmath60 can not change the value of the @xmath55 part of ( [ sep ] ) , the @xmath56 part must be a constant . at this point ,",
    "if our goal was to simply remove the angular dependence from the dirac equation , we would be done . by replacing the angular part of ( [ sep ] ) by a constant we would be restricting ourselves to some spinor that is an eigenfunction of the angular operators in the dirac equation .",
    "in fact only one of its eigenvalues , rather than the precise form of the angular eigenfunction , would need to be known . however , our goal is not only to eliminate the angular dependence of our equation of motion , but also to have a matter source that generates a spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "an individual spinor is _ not _ a spherically symmetric object ( it always has a spin - angular momentum that breaks this symmetry ) and therefore can not by itself produce such a spacetime .",
    "what we require are multiple spinors where all the individual spin - angular momenta counterbalance each other so the system has no net spin .",
    "we will use two spinors , for simplicity , but any even number of the appropriate spinors could also be used .",
    "the spherically symmetric stress - energy tensor for the system , @xmath61 , is found from the sum of the stress - energy tensors of the individual spinor fields @xcite . @xmath62",
    "evaluating the right hand side of equation ( [ incsum ] ) _ does _ require the angular eigenfunctions that we will now compute .",
    "setting the angular part of equation ( [ sep ] ) equal to a constant , @xmath63 , gives : @xmath64 h_{2 } = - n h_{1},\\ ] ] @xmath65 h_{1 } = n h_{2},\\ ] ] where we have multiplied the first and second components of the angular terms in  ( [ split ] ) by @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , so that the bracketed terms in the above expression are the raising and lowering operators , @xmath68 ( eth ) and @xmath69 ( ethbar ) , respectively .",
    "these operators act on the spin weighted spherical harmonics , @xmath70 , ( see @xcite and @xcite ) in the following way : @xmath71 @xmath72 our functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 have the spin weights @xmath75 : @xmath76 @xmath77    to form a spin singlet , all we require is one spinor constructed from @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and one spinor from @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "these spin weighted spherical harmonics are : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 and are solutions to ( [ eth ] ) and ( [ ethbar ] ) for @xmath86 .",
    "thus , for our two spinor fields , we have : @xmath87 @xmath88 from the above results , we can now derive the following radial equations of motion from  ( [ sep ] ) : @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 where we have written the complex functions , @xmath93 and @xmath94 in terms of real functions via @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "although the spinors ( [ spinor+ ] ) and ( [ spinor- ] ) both yield the same radial equations of motion ( [ eom1])-([eom4 ] ) , they have different stress - energy tensors .",
    "we calculate the stress - tensor for each field individually using : @xmath97\\ ] ] where the dirac adjoint of @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 here , @xmath9 is the so - called hermitizing matrix , needed in the computation of real - valued expressions ( such as the current density or , in this case , the stress - energy tensor ) from the complex - valued spinors .",
    "it is to be chosen so that both @xmath9 and @xmath100 are hermitian , and we take @xmath101 .",
    "computing @xmath61 for each of the two spinors ( [ spinor+ ] ) and ( [ spinor- ] ) and summing the results yields the following non - vanishing components of the spherically symmetric stress - energy tensor : @xmath102 @xmath103\\ ] ] @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 contracting the stress - energy tensor gives @xmath107 which is expected since the massless dirac system is conformally invariant .",
    "having computed a stress - energy tensor that will generate a spherically symmetric spacetime , we can now write down the einstein equations that will fix @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    due to our choice of coordinates ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint and the slicing condition comprise a sufficient subset of the einstein equations to be used in our numerical solution .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is @xmath108 and is treated as an equation for @xmath12 .",
    "we note that the momentum constraint , @xmath109 also yields an equation for @xmath31 ( an evolution equation ) that we use as a means to check the consistency of our equations , both at the analytic level , and during numerical evolutions .",
    "we note that in both equations ( [ hamcon ] ) and ( [ momcon ] ) , time derivatives of @xmath110 s and @xmath111 s have been eliminated using the equations of motion ( [ eom1])-([eom4 ] ) .",
    "the slicing condition , which fixes @xmath11 , is derived from the evolution equation for @xmath112 and the fact that for polar slicing we have @xmath113 since @xmath114 . to maintain @xmath115 for all time ,",
    "we impose @xmath116 , which yields @xmath117",
    "the above equations of motion were solved using a crank - nicholson update scheme , standard @xmath118 spatial derivatives , and berger - oliger style adaptive mesh refinement ( see @xcite ) on the computational domain , @xmath119 , @xmath120 . to achieve stability ,",
    "high frequency modes were damped using kreiss - oliger dissipation @xcite . at @xmath121 ,",
    "the following regularity conditions were enforced : @xmath122 at @xmath123 , outgoing wave conditions are imposed on the matter fields : @xmath124    we also have @xmath125 which follows from the demand of regularity ( local flatness ) at @xmath126 . at each time step , the hamiltonian constraint is integrated outwards from @xmath121 using a point - wise newton method .",
    "the slicing condition  ( [ lapse ] ) is solved subject to the outer boundary condition @xmath127 , so that , provided that all of the matter remains within the computational domain , coordinate time and proper time coincide at spatial infinity .",
    "we note that the more natural normalization choice , from the point of view of critical collapse , is @xmath128 .",
    "however , computationally , this choice would vitiate our ability to compute with a fixed courant factor , @xmath129 , particularly in the near - critical regime , and would thus unnecessarily complicate the numerical solution .",
    "the results presented below were generated from the study of three distinct parametrized families of initial data , which we refer to as gaussians , spatial derivatives of gaussians , and kink  anti - kink . in all cases ,",
    "the initial datasets were such that the pulses were essentially ingoing with positive energy at @xmath130 .",
    "the specific forms used are as follows :    _ gaussian _ : @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134    _ derivative of gaussian _ : @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath135 @xmath136    _ kink anti - kink _ : @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath137",
    "@xmath138    in each case the family parameter , @xmath3 , can be used to control whether the mass - energy of the system collapses to form a black hole , or if it implodes through the center ( @xmath126 ) and disperses to spatial infinity .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , and in a process now familiar from many other studies of critical collapse , as @xmath3 is tuned to the black hole threshold @xmath139 , the single unstable mode associated with the critical solution is `` tuned away '' to reveal the critical solution _ per se_.    in the current case , we find strong indications from such studies that the critical solution for the spherically symmetric emd ( einstein - massless - dirac ) system describes a continuously self - similar ( css ) geometry .",
    "typical evidence for this claim is shown in fig .",
    "[ aplot ] , which displays near - critical evolution of the scale invariant quantity , @xmath31 .",

    "is a scaling law for the black hole mass near criticality : @xmath140 and , as expected , we find strong evidence that the scaling exponent , @xmath15 , is universal in that it is independent of the family of initial data used to generate the critical solution .",
    "the values of @xmath15 computed for the different families are summarized in table  [ scalexp ] , and we note that there is uncertainty in the third digit of the quoted values .",

    "[ bhplot ] does not oscillate about the fit line since the geometry is continuously self - similar .",
    "this lack of regular oscillations about the fit line is shown more clearly in fig .",
    "[ bherr ] .    , with uncertainty in the third digit . as we tune arbitrarily close to the critical parameter , @xmath4 , black holes of arbitrarily small masses are formed , indicative of a type ii critical solution .",
    "the small irregularities visible in the plot are shown and discussed in more detail in fig .",
    "[ bherr ] ]     with respect to the computed linear fit .",
    "the absence of regular oscillations indicates that the geometry is not discretely self - similar .",
    "there are , however , features in the plot , notably the `` spikes '' , that can be explained as follows .",
    "the matter fields have a discretely self - similar nature , but combine to produce a continuously self - similar geometry .",
    "truncation error effects , combined with the fact that our determination of black hole mass is not precise , result in a residual imprint of the dss nature of the dirac fields in the plot .",
    "in fact the spikes in this plot occur as the amplitude of the dirac fields reach an extremum near the black hole , periodically in @xmath141 . ]",
    "given the numerical evidence suggesting the existence of a self - similar solution at the black hole threshold , we proceed to an _ ab initio _ computation of the critical solution based on the application of a self - similar ansatz to our system .",
    "the development here closely parallels the work done by hirschmann and eardley @xcite , who considered the case of a massless , complex scalar field .    by definition ,",
    "a self - similar spacetime has a homothetic killing vector , @xmath142 , that obeys @xmath143 where the factor @xmath10 is simply a matter of convention .",
    "we want to define coordinates , @xmath144 that are adapted to this self - similar symmetry . specifically with @xmath145 adapted to the vector field @xmath146 , ( [ hkill1 ] ) can be written as : @xmath147 performing a separation of variables on the metric tensor and then solving ( [ hkill2 ] ) for the @xmath145-dependent part yields @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the part of the metric that depends only on @xmath150 .",
    "the original coordinates @xmath55 are related to @xmath144 by : @xmath151    the equations of interest will take the same form for any value of the constant factor , @xmath152 , and without loss of generality , we subsequently take @xmath153 .",
    "the time @xmath154 is the value of coordinate time to which the self - similar solution asymptotes as it propagates down to arbitrarily small scales , and , from the point of view of critical evolution , is a natural temporal origin for use in describing the dynamics .",
    "further , as mentioned previously , in analyzing self - similar critical solutions , it is natural to adopt a parameterization of the @xmath46=constant surfaces , such that @xmath46 coincides with central proper time .",
    "we thus adopt such a normalization , and additionally adjust @xmath46 so that @xmath155 .    in these new coordinates , the metric  ( [ metric ] ) becomes @xmath156.\\ ] ] we note that the @xmath145 coordinate is timelike , and , as can be verified by comparing the right hand sides of ( [ metsep ] ) and ( [ cssmetric ] ) , that the functions , @xmath157 and @xmath31 are functions of the spacelike coordinate , @xmath150 , alone",

    "we require knowledge of the @xmath145 dependence of our field quantities . this is determined by performing the coordinate transformations on the equations of motion ( [ eom1])-([eom4 ] ) and the geometric equations ( [ hamcon ] ) and ( [ lapse ] ) , and then ascertaining what @xmath145 dependence is needed in @xmath110 and @xmath111 to produce a set of @xmath145 independent odes .",
    "a suitable ansatz is @xmath160 @xmath161 where the @xmath162 terms reflect the fact that , as the pde solutions have revealed , we expect the matter fields to exhibit discrete self - similarity .",
