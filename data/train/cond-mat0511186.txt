    "for the past few years , the interesting properties of complex network , which can be found in many fields , such as biology , sociology , physics , and so on , have attracted a number of people to explore .",
    "great contribution including the idea and analysis of random networks@xcite , small world networks such as the ws network@xcite has been made to the modeling process@xcite .",
    "however , real world networks such as internet , movie actor and science collaboration graph(see @xcite all show a power - law degree distribution property , which can not be explained by the two models mentioned above . a scale free model@xcite that satisfies a lot of real systems and led many subsequent researchers to further studying has been found by barabasi and albert in 1999 . on the other hand",
    ", this model suffers a drawback that the exponent of the power law is always fixed , while in real networks it varies .",
    "further study has made it explicit that preferential attachment plays a key role in deciding whether the evolving network shows scaling property as expectedbarabasi , barabasi2,dorogovtsev1,dorogovtsev2,dorogovtsev3 . in 2000 , an exact solution to the degree distribution of ba model was obtained by dorogovtsev , mendes and samukhin@xcite . in their paper , different initial attractiveness",
    "is used , to change the exponent of the power - law curve .",
    "network models are applied to the description of the complex human interactions , known as social networks .",
    "enlightened by the fact that there are complicated relationships between the elements of social networks , researchers brought multiple - type vertex rather than single one , into network models@xcite .",
    "weighted edges as represented by kinds of social relationships are also introduced in this area@xcite .",
    "both models show scaling properties .",
    "it is challenging to find more fundamental network structures .",
    "similarly , our model can be understood from another perspective .",
    "one way , but not the exclusive one , to understand our concept is to consider the internet as a network , which comprised by online websites as nodes .",
    "we set the virtual connections , e.g. the transportation forms of information between different websites rather than physical wires and cables , as edges between the nodes .",
    "it is clear that there are various kinds of communication ways between two websites ( http , ftp ) .",
    "so to speak , different kinds of links need to be applied to growing networks , where competitions exist between different links as well as the nodes .",
    "it is attractive to discover the topologies of the whole network and different sub - networks containing only one kind of the two edges , and to consider the relation between different edges . in the model",
    "we construct , the whole network is somewhat like the partial preference ba model .",
    "the significant difference is that we add some tunable parameters into the preferential attachment , which makes it possible to alter the exponent of the power - law degree distribution and the shift constant of degree distribution function .",
    "our work begins with the discussion of a scale free network growing like the ba model with a change of the preferential attachment .",
    "this is a special example of the growing networks put forward by dorogovstev and mendes in 2000@xcite in which they add a constant in the preferential attachment term . in our main work , the tunable parameters in",
    "the model play different roles in different edge preferential attachments , and are regarded as a weight to discriminate different attractiveness of different links in the evolving network .",
    "the research produces some interesting results : the whole network and the two sub - networks all evolve just like the ordinary scale free network , while the two kinds of links connected to a certain node always differ .  besides , the degree distributions of the two sub - networks are unequal",
    "at the beginning , we revise the ba model only a bit and get different expressions of the degree distribution function . before introducing our findings , it is necessary to take a look at the work by dorogovstev and mendes in 2000@xcite .",
    "their contribution mainly lies with the modulation of the original ba model and the way they solved the problem , well known as the master equation approach. in their paper , the preferential attachment in ba model is no longer fixed ; instead , changeable initial attractiveness , which is given to each site , together with incoming links of the site , determines the probability whether a new link will point to this site . under long - time limitation ,",
    "the exponent of the degree distribution varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , depending on the initial attractiveness . in this paper",
    "we do not intend to discuss too many complicated forms of preferential attachments deriving from the ba model .",
    "we barely make a simple and clear revision , and attain concise and approximately precise results , with the application of continuum theory .    the preferential attachment in ba model",
    "is changed in this way : the possibility of the degree increase of a site is proportional to @xmath2(@xmath3 is the degree of site i , while @xmath4 is a given constant ) .",
    "this model may be considered as a special example of the model generalized by dorogovestev and mendes if one takes @xmath5 in their model as @xmath6 in our case . by making use of master equation to solve this problem ,",
    "the degree distribution was found to have the exponent @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "a linear shift @xmath9 is found in the distribution function @xmath10}{\\gamma ( ma)}(q+ma)^{-(2+a ) } \\label{pk1}\\]]we here apply continuum theory , rather than master equation , to solve the problem we raise .",
    "it is not difficult to draw the following equation:@xmath11where @xmath12 is the number of links every time the network increases .",
    "the solution is quite simple : as @xmath13 approaches infinity , the degree distribution follows this equation @xmath14compare the degree functions ( [ pk1 ] ) and ( [ pk2 ] ) , taking the power term into account , and we find that the two results are the same in essence . in our derivation",
    "the tunable parameter is @xmath4 , while in d&m s it s the initial attractiveness @xmath5 . by transforming @xmath5 to @xmath6 or inversely ,",
    "the two functions show the same property .",
    "this transformation is reasonable .",
    "if we adopt d&m s way@xcite in our model , @xmath5 should be the initial degree a site has when it enters the network , which is exactly @xmath6 . in d&m",
    "s paper@xcite , the exponent @xmath15 varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 while in our model , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath4 can be taken from @xmath17 to @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the range is the same .",
    "the advantage by using continuum theory is that no special function appears , which makes it relatively easy to solve the two - link networks we conceive in the following content .",
    "another difference between our model and d&m s model is that we consider the network as an undirected network while they consider the network as directed .",
    "the following is our new proposal based on the idea of a new kind of network .",
    "this network , which contains two kinds of edges , is very different from the networks we have studied till now .",
    "if we consider the different links as identical , the model should come back to partial preferential attachment ba case . to reach this point briefly ,",
    "we give different linear preferential attachments to two kinds of edges respectively .",
    "of course , modulatory parameters are added to make our model changeable to fit the real networks .    _ the model : _ at each time interval , a new node adds to the network and connects to the old nodes with @xmath12 edges .",
    "we divide the @xmath12 edges into two types : one is called @xmath18 edge(or @xmath18 link ) and the other @xmath19 edge(or @xmath19 link ) . the probability that node @xmath20 in the original network",
    "makes a connection to the new added node follows such preferential attachments:@xmath21@xmath22where @xmath23 represents the number of @xmath18-edges node @xmath20 has connected at time @xmath13 ; @xmath24 represents the number of @xmath19-edges .    here",
    ", we give linear asymmetric expressions in @xmath18 and @xmath19 edge aiming to represent the linear relations in two networks .",
    "however , we do not assume this to be exactly the reflection of real world networks , it is a step forward in the direction of finding out complex relations between networks that share same nodes but different links",
    ". the parameter @xmath25 here plays the key role in determining the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 network : when @xmath25 is very small , it can be neglected so that the two networks evolve in the same way they just behave as the same network .",
    "when @xmath25 approaches infinity , say , some relatively large number , the above expressions show that new edges will always be added as @xmath18 edges while the number of @xmath19 edges could only remain constant instead of increasing .",
    "in general , @xmath25 is used to determine the difference of the increasing rates of the two different edges .",
    "the number of total edges node @xmath20 connects satisfies the following equation:@xmath26we have studied this kind of network before , @xmath27 and degree distribution follows equation ( [ pk2 ] ) .",
    "firstly , we discuss @xmath19 sub - network . because we add @xmath12 edges at every time step , so@xmath28according to continuum theory , equation ( [ ey ] ) became@xmath29its solution is@xmath30when @xmath13 approaches infinity , @xmath31 approaches @xmath32 and",
    "@xmath24 becomes@xmath33then we obtain    @xmath34    for large @xmath13 , @xmath35 reads@xmath36up to now , we have got the mathematical expression of degree distribution of @xmath19 sub - network .",
    "i.e. equation ( [ pyr ] ) .",
    "the degree distribution is power law with the same exponent as that of total degree distribution but without shift @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , we proceed in @xmath18 sub - network . according to equation ( [ ex ] ) and",
    "( [ yi ] ) , we get@xmath37under long - time limitation , we neglect @xmath38 , and obtain@xmath39the same as what we dealt with @xmath19 sub - network , the degree distribution of @xmath40 sub - network becomes@xmath41^{(2+\\frac{f}{m})}(x+f)^{-(3+\\frac{f}{m})}\\]]it is a power - law distribution with shift @xmath4 . the preferential attachments ( [ ex ] ) and ( [ ey ] ) are not the same .",
    "therefore , the number of @xmath42 edges does not equal to the number of @xmath43 edges . from the calculations above",
    ", we get the ratios of total degree to @xmath42 degree and @xmath43 degree @xmath44the subscript @xmath45 in @xmath46 means the degree in total network .",
    "we made computer simulations of the model .",
    "the results accorded with the theoretical predictions quite well at most parameters ranges .",
    "figure figure1(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) give simulations of networks with size @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively . with log - log scale ,",
    "the main part of the distributions give slope lines in the figure .",
    "the slopes of linear fit approximately equal to the theoretical results ( @xmath50 respectively ) .",
    "the prediction of the ratios of @xmath42 degree to @xmath43 degree are also confirmed by numerical simulations ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "one should notice that in the figures , we had made shifts for @xmath42 degree distributions and total degree distributions from @xmath51 and @xmath46 to @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "therefore , their log - log plots behave as straight lines parallel to those of @xmath43 degree .",
    "however , we found that when we take small @xmath25 , the simulations are always different from theoretical predictions . with small @xmath25 , when @xmath4 is positive , the component of @xmath42 degree is larger than theoretical value while the component @xmath43 degree accords with theoretical value ( see figure figure3(a ) ) ; and when @xmath4 is negative , the component of @xmath43 degree is larger than theoretical value while the component of @xmath42 degree accords with theoretical value(see figure [ figure3](b ) ) . in theoretical calculus , at infinite @xmath13 limitation , we neglect the last term of equation ( [ gg ] )",
    ". when @xmath25 is small , decay of this term is slow , and actually in numerical simulations , @xmath13 is not infinite . therefore , the neglect of this term make the bias of simulation results from predictions at small @xmath25 .",
    "we also looked at the fluctuation of @xmath42 degree @xmath54 to theoretical value as a function of total degree @xmath55 .",
    "it illustrates how the competition generates heterogeneity in edge composition of each vertex .",
    "we calculated the relative standard deviation respectively to theoretical value .",
    "the fluctuation decreases quickly with the increase of total degree nearly in a power law way ( see figure [ figure4 ] ) .",
    "we did not calculate the standard deviation of @xmath56 because @xmath43 degree may be zero for some vertexes .",
    "the mathematical expressions of degree distribution of both @xmath19 sub - network and @xmath18 sub - network provide deep insight into the dynamics of evolving systems .",
    "we build a competitive environment where not only nodes but also different types of links compete .",
    "this model can reflect many properties of social network .",
    "a newly added node has a fixed number of @xmath12 adding edges .",
    "however , other nodes decided how many @xmath18 edges and @xmath19 edges there would be .",
    "obviously , other nodes compete for these @xmath12 edges by what they already have .",
    "for instance , let @xmath18-edge denotes financial relationship between individual persons , and @xmath19 represents other connection .",
    "rich people tend to have more financial relationship with other people , while interestingly , more financial links signifies his richness .",
    "but when we focus on other links between people , rich people are not necessarily to be so lucky .",
    "due to the limitation of personal capability , time , devotion , one can not have infinite connections with others .",
    "therefore , it is at the expense of less @xmath19 edges to get more @xmath18 edges , and vice versa .",
    "the above study shows the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath19 edges .",
    "an important character of this model is that the degree distribution of @xmath18 sub - network shows a linear shift while @xmath19 sub - network does not .",
    "simulations confirm this character , though the exact value of the shift may has some errors , due to the application of mean - field approximation .",
    "the difference of linear shift between @xmath18 and @xmath19 sub - network comes from different preferential attachment .",
    "@xmath12 is always thought as a fixed number in a certain network , for we can identify at least vaguely how many links are added in each time interval .",
    "the value of @xmath4 varies from @xmath17 to @xmath1 , but if @xmath4 is too large both of total degree distribution and @xmath42 degree distribution approach exponential increment,@xmath58 }   \\notag \\\\ & \\approx f^{-(3+\\frac{f}{m})}e^{-(3+\\frac{f}{m})\\frac{x}{f}}=f^{-(3+\\frac{f}{m})}e^{-x(\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{3}{f})}\\end{aligned}\\]]and if @xmath59 , the characteristic degree of total network and @xmath18 sub - network is @xmath12 . on the other hand , when @xmath4 is taken a bit large",
    ", the actual probability to connect @xmath19 links will be so small that in the end most of the nodes have small @xmath43 degree , while the rest have very large @xmath43 degree .",
    "note that in the several derivations above , we neglect the term @xmath60 for time @xmath13 is considered approaching to infinite .",
    "however , this ideal condition can not be reached to apply the model , i.e. @xmath13 will always be finite actually , even considerable large .",
    "so problem rises that if @xmath57 @xmath4 and @xmath12 are chosen or set so that the component @xmath61 is small enough and the whole term becomes an unneglectable factor to the degree distribution .",
    "the derivation above may not hold true .",
    "but if we take this term into account , we will find ourself awkward in searching a precise solution for the function of degree distribution .",
    "the most intriguing parameter in the parameters is @xmath25 .",
    "apparently , from above discussion , @xmath25 should not be chosen too small to make the term @xmath31 unneglectable .",
    "the simulations showed that small @xmath25 make the degree distributions depart from predictions .",
    "@xmath25 should not be too large , as well .",
    "a very large @xmath25 in finite time lead the network to have few @xmath19 links also , as we have found by computer simulation .",
    "based on above reasons , @xmath25 is preferred to be such a number that is neither too large , nor too small . here",
    "we only use vague words `` large '' and `` small '' , for these limitations are due to the finity of time a network evolves and the finity of nodes and links it contains . to say a bit more accurate , we need @xmath25 to be big enough , with a view to @xmath13 , to make the term @xmath31 small enough to be neglected ; but @xmath25 should not be too larger to make @xmath62 too larger than @xmath63 , which leads the network having few @xmath19 edges .    for a given node with degree @xmath55 at given time , the probability @xmath64 that how many @xmath18 edges it has follows equation ( [ ex ] ) .",
    "the figure [ figure4 ] shows the fluctuation decreases quickly with @xmath55 .",
    "it seems that the distribution of fluctuation should follows the binomial distribution .",
    "however , here the degree of a node is varying with time .",
    "it increased from @xmath65 to @xmath55 and @xmath66 varied synchronously .",
    "it results in the fact that the fluctuation of the number of @xmath18 edges is much smaller than that of the binomial distribution .",
    "finally we discuss directed network and find some difference between this kind of network and what we have studied .",
    "we give general results below .",
    "every time step , we introduce @xmath12 directed edges .",
    "the whole degree has a @xmath12 increment ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath67using the same approaches , we get@xmath68and the degree distributions of @xmath18 subnetwork and @xmath19 subnetwork are@xmath69^{(1+\\frac{f}{m})}(k+f)^{-(2+\\frac{f}{m})}\\]]@xmath70the ratios of total degree to @xmath18 degree and @xmath19 degree are@xmath71compared with the results of undirected network ( [ ratio ] ) , one can find that proportion of @xmath19 edges of directed network is larger than that of undirected network ."
