    "as a successful geometric theory of gravitation , einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) has been confirmed in all observations devoted to its testing to date @xcite , in particular in famous experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the pursuit of testing gravity at much higher precision has ever continued in the past decades , including measurements of the earth - moon separation as a function of time through lunar laser ranging @xcite . on the other hand , formulating and",
    "quantitatively interpreting the test of gravity is another question and an interesting proposal in this respect has been formulated in the frameworks of the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) framework @xcite .",
    "different from the original physical indication @xcite , scale independent post - newtonian parameter denoted by @xmath4 , with @xmath7 representing gr , may serve as a test of the theory on large distances .",
    "this paper is focused on the quantitative constraints of the gr as a theory of gravity , using the recently - released large sample of galaxy scale strong gravitational lensing systems discovered and observed in slacs , bells , lsd , and sl2s surveys @xcite .",
    "up to now , most of the progress in strong gravitational lensing has been made in investigating cosmological parameters @xcite , the distribution of matter in massive galaxies acting as lenses @xcite , and the photometric properties of background sources at cosmological distances @xcite . all the above mentioned results",
    "have been obtained under the assumption that gr is valid . using strong lensing systems @xcite reported the value for the present - day matter density @xmath8 ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 at 99% confidence level .",
    "this initial result , confirmed in later strong lensing studies ( e.g. @xcite ) is consistent with most of the current data including precision measurements of type ia supernovae @xcite and the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "currently , the concordance @xmath1cdm model is in agreement with most of the available cosmological observations , in which the cosmological constant contributing more than 70% to the total energy of the universe is playing the role of an exotic component called dark energy responsible for accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "however , there appeared noticeable tensions between different cosmological probes .",
    "for example , regarding the @xmath9 there is a tension between the cmb results from planck @xcite and the most recent type ia supernovae data @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath10 parameter derived from the cmb results from planck @xcite turned out to be in tension with the recent tomographic cosmic shear results both from the canada france hawaii telescope lensing survey ( cfhtlens ) @xcite and the kilo degree survey ( kids ) @xcite .",
    "these tensions partly motivate the test of gr performed in the present paper .    with reasonable prior assumptions and independent measurements concerning background cosmology and internal structure of lensing galaxies",
    ", one can use strong lening systems as another tool to constrain the ppn parameters describing the deviations from the gr .",
    "this idea was first adopted on 15 slacs lenses by @xcite , who found the post - newtonian parameter to be @xmath11 based on priors on galaxy structure from local observations .",
    "more recently , @xcite re - examined the expanded slacs sample @xcite and obtained a constraint on the ppn parameter @xmath12 .",
    "having available reasonable catalogs of strong lenses : containing more than 100 lenses , with spectroscopic as well as astrometric data obtained with well defined selection criteria @xcite , the purpose of this work is to use a mass - selected sample of 80 early - type lenses compiled from slacs , bells , lsd , and sl2s to provide independent constraints on the post - newtonian parameter @xmath4 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat @xmath1cdm cosmology with parameters based on the recent _ planck _ observations @xcite .",
    "our goal will be to constrain deviations from general relativity at the level of @xmath4 post - newtonian parameter .",
    "the ppn form of the schwarzschild metric can be written as @xmath13 general relativity corresponds to @xmath2 .    from the theory of gravitational lensing @xcite , for a specific strong lensing system with the intervening galaxy acting as a lens",
    ", multiple images can form with angular separations close to the so - called einstein radius @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass enclosed within a cylinder of radius equal to the einstein radius , @xmath17 is the distance to the source , @xmath18 is the distance to the lens , and @xmath19 is the distance between the lens and the source .",
    "all the above mentioned distances are angular - diameter distances . rearranging terms with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the cylindrical radius perpendicular to the line of sight  the @xmath22-axis )",
    ", we obtain a useful formula : @xmath23 which indicates that only the matter within the einstein ring is important according to the gauss s law .",
    "on the other hand , spectroscopic measurements of central velocity dispersions @xmath24 in elliptical galaxies , can provide a dynamical estimate of this mass , based on power - law density profiles for the total mass density , @xmath25 , and luminosity density , @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the spherical radial coordinate from the lens center : @xmath29 . in order to characterize anisotropic distribution of three - dimensional velocity dispersion pattern , one introduces @xcite an anisotropy parameter @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the tangential and radial components of the velocity dispersion . in the current analysis",
    "we will consider anisotropic distribution @xmath34 and assume , as it almost always is assumed , that @xmath30 is independent of @xmath28 .",
    "following the well - known spherical jeans equation @xcite , the radial velocity dispersion of the luminous matter @xmath35 in the early - type lens galaxies can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath30 is a constant velocity anisotropy parameter . combining the mass density profiles in eq .",

    "@xmath39 taken after @xcite , we obtain a convenient form for the radial velocity dispersion by scaling the dynamical mass to the einstein radius : @xmath40 \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}\\left(\\xi- 2 \\beta \\right ) \\lambda(\\alpha ) } \\left(\\frac{r}{r_e}\\right)^{2 - \\alpha}\\ ] ]    in all strong lensing measurements we use , the _ observed _ velocity dispersion is reported , which is a projected , luminosity weighted average of the radially - dependent velocity dispersion profile of the lensing galaxy .",
    "its theoretical value can be calculated from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : binney ] ) with the assumption that the relationship between stellar number density and stellar luminosity density is spatially constant .",
    "this assumption is unlikely to be violated appreciably within the effective radius of the early - type lens galaxies under consideration .      for the purpose of our analysis , the angular diameter distances @xmath48 between reshifts @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "were calculated using the best - fit matter density parameter @xmath8 given by _",
    "collaboration assuming flat frw metric @xcite .",
    "moreover , we allow the luminosity density profile to be different from the total - mass density profile , i.e. , @xmath51 , and the stellar velocity anisotropy exits , i.e. , @xmath34 . based on a well - studied sample of nearby elliptical galaxies from @xcite ,",
    "the anisotropy @xmath30 is characterized by a gaussian distribution , @xmath52 , which is also extensively used in the previous works @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite measured the stellar velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath30 and its correlations with redshifts and stellar velocity dispersion , based on the illustris simulated early - type galaxies with spherically symmetric density distributions .",
    "it is worth noting from their results that @xmath30 markedly depends on stellar velocity dispersion and its mean value varies from 0.10 to 0.30 for intermediate - mass galaxies ( @xmath53 ) , which is consistent with the values used in our analysis .",
    "following our previous analysis @xcite concerning power - law mass and luminosity density profiles of elliptical galaxies , we used a mass - selected sample of strong lensing systems , taken from a comprehensive compilation of strong lensing systems observed by four surveys : slacs , bells , lsd and sl2s .",
    "the sample has been defined by restricting the velocity dispersions of lensing galaxies * to * the intermediate range : @xmath53 .",
    "lenses of this sub - sample are located at redshifts ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "original data about these strong lenses were derived by @xcite , and more comprehensive data concerning these systems can be found in table 1 of @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the scatter plot for this sample in the plane spanned by the redshift of the lens and its velocity dispersion .    ]",
    "because @xmath46 , and @xmath47 could not be independently measured for each lensing galaxy , we firstly treated them as free parameters and inferred @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath4 , simultaneously . performing fits on the strong lensing data - set ,",
    "the 68% confidence level uncertainties on the three model parameters are @xmath56 fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows these constraints in the parameter space of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath4 .",
    "it is obvious that fits on @xmath46 and @xmath47 are well consistent with the analysis results of @xcite , which are characterized by gaussian distributions : @xmath57 more importantly , the degeneracy between the two parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath47 , is apparently indicated by the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , i.e. , a steeper luminosity - density profile for the lensing early - type galaxies will lead to a larger value for the parameterized post - newtonian parameter .",
    "this tendency could also be seen from the sensitivity analysis shown below .    now the parameters characterizing the total mass - profile shape , velocity anisotropy , and light - profile shape of lenses are set at their best measured values . performing fits on @xmath4",
    ", we find the resulting posterior probability density shown in fig .",
    "the result @xmath0 ( 1@xmath24 confidence ) is consistent with @xmath7 and also with previous results of @xcite obtained with strong lensing systems .",
    "the scatter of galaxy structure parameters is an important source of systematic errors on the final result . taking the best - fitted values of the structure parameters as our fiducial model",
    ", we investigated how the ppn constraint is altered by introducing the uncertainties on @xmath46 , @xmath30 , and @xmath47 as listed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphabeta_pars ] ) .",

    ", one can see from table  [ priorresult ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that constraint on @xmath4 is quite sensitive to small systematic shifts in the adopted lens - galaxy parameters . by comparing the contribution of each of these systematic errors to the systematic error on @xmath4 , we find that the largest sources of systematic error are the mass density slope @xmath46 , followed by the anisotropy parameter of velocity dispersion @xmath30 and and the luminosity density slope @xmath47 . secondly , by considering the intrinsic scatter of @xmath46 , @xmath30 , and @xmath47 into consideration",
    ", we found @xmath4 varying from 0.845 to 1.240 at 1@xmath24 confidence level .",
    "it means that systematic errors might exceed @xmath3 of the final result .",

    "[ fig2 ] motivate the future use of auxiliary data to improve constraints on @xmath46 , @xmath30 and @xmath47 .",
    "for example , @xmath46 can be inferred for individual lenses from high resolution imaging of arcs @xcite , while constraints on @xmath30 and @xmath47 can be improved with integral field unit ( ifu ) data @xcite , without the assumption of general relativity ( gr ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] ]    another issue which should be discussed is by how much is @xmath4 affected by the uncertainty of cosmological parameters of the @xmath1cdm model used in our study . for this purpose , we also considered wmap9 result of @xmath58 in order to make comparison with",
    "_ planck _ observations .",
    "not surprisingly , the result was that differences were negligible .",
    "it could have been expected because cosmology intervenes here through the distance ratio @xmath59 , which is very weakly dependent on the value of @xmath8 and in flat cosmology does not depend on @xmath9 at all .",
    "the next generation wide and deep sky surveys with improved depth , area and resolution may , in the near future , increase the current galactic - scale lens sample sizes by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "such a significant increase of the number of strong lensing systems will considerably improve the constraints on the ppn parameter .",
    "now we will illustrate what kind of result one could get using the future data from the forthcoming large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) survey , which may detect 120000 lenses for the most optimistic scenario @xcite . in order to make a good comparison with the results derived with current strong lensing systems ( fig .",

    "<S> based on a mass - selected sample of galaxy - scale strong gravitational lenses from the slacs , bells , lsd and sl2s surveys and using a well - motivated fiducial set of lens - galaxy parameters we tested the weak - field metric on kiloparsec scales and found a constraint on the post - newtonian parameter @xmath0 under the assumption of a flat @xmath1cdm universe with parameters taken from _ </S>",

    "<S> uncertainties concerning the total mass density profile , anisotropy of the velocity dispersion and the shape of the light - profile combine to systematic uncertainties of @xmath3 . by applying a cosmological model independent method to the simulated future lsst data </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that strong - lensing systems with measured stellar velocity dispersions may serve as another important probe to investigate validity of the gr , if the mass - dynamical structure of the lensing galaxies is accurately constrained in the future lens surveys . </S>"
