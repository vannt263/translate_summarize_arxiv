    "these structures conform the third generation of solar cells that can increase the energy conversion efficiency limit up to @xmath0 @xcite . therefore , a whole new generation devices are based on arrays of qds that form the stack layers , thus , is needed a detailed explanation of the opto electronic response of these arrays .",
    "+ the movement of the electrons under illumination conditions in the qds are governed by three basic mechanisms : i ) promotion to an excited state assisted by a photon ( photon absorption ) , ii ) relaxation transitions from excited states to ground state ( stimulated photon emission ) and iii ) tunneling processes to the neighbor qds or electrodes , since the phonon scattering is suppressed by the phonon bottleneck effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to generate a net photo - current , the photo - generated electron has to be extracted before recombining , thus , the charge transport from the location of photo - generation to the leads becomes a crucial point that governs the response of the system .",
    "indeed , to obtain a good optoelectronic device not only the photo - generation has to be effective , also the charge transport extraction mechanisms must be efficient to enable electronic current flow .",
    "these transport mechanisms depend on tunneling processes thus being strongly dependent on the insulator material and also on the geometrical arrangement of the qds .",

    "the charge evolution inside each dot can be written and solved in the steady state extracting the non equilibrium distribution function of each qd . + moreover , the influence of the applied bias voltage has been introduced taking into account the capacitive coupling between the different elements of the system .",
    "the effect of the accumulated charge in each dot is also taken into account within the self - consistent field regime .",
    "+ in order to describe the system as realistic as possible all the variables that appear in the model have been expressed as a function of basic material constant .",

    "the capacity values have been described using expressions between a infinite plane and a sphere and between two spheres to calculate the qd - lead and qd - qd capacities respectively .",

    "when the bohr radius is larger than the qd radius the strong confinement regime is achieved @xcite and the e - h interaction can be treated as a perturbation .",

    "we present two scenarios : a ) the qd symmetrically connected to the leads and ( b ) in asymmetric configuration .",
    "an interesting result appears for v=0 . in the symmetrically coupled system ( a ) , the current is zero since the incoming hole currents for each side equals the outgoing electron currents .",
    "therefore , the net current is zero because the electron and hole currents compensate each other .",
    "this result derives intuitively from the rate equation , as it can be viewed as a sum of intensities in each energy level equals to zero .",
    "therefore , in order to generate a net photo - current the symmetry of the qd respect to the leads must be broken , hence , different coupling to the leads are needed as show in the asymmetric case .",

    "this effect is the result of competition between two processes , the pure light current term and the external bias voltage term . for small voltages ,",
    "the optical terms dominate and the optical transition peaks are observed , but when the voltage increases the tunneling currents become the most important terms and the current appears as a photon energy independent . +    in the same way , in fig .  [ i(v)+hnu ]",
    "we show the obtained current voltage curve i(v ) under external illumination for the same previous system as a function of the energy of the incident photon . in fig .",
    "[ i(v)+hnu ] a - b ) we show the current for the symmetric and asymmetric structure respectively .",
    "as it was demonstrated in previous works @xcite , the symmetry of the dark i(v ) curves depends on the symmetry of the coupling to the leads , and current plateaus appear when conduction channels are opened @xcite . for the illuminated case ,",
    "the main differences appear for small voltages .",
    "the i(v ) curve looses the step like behavior since the occupancy of the energy levels are not sequential with the applied bias voltage due to optical transitions .",
    "moreover , the optical transitions tend to fill the conduction states while the valence states become emptied increasing the electron / hole currents . as a consequence ,",
    "more conduction channels are opened and the total current is bigger than in the dark case .",

    "@xcite , the parallel and serial configurations revealed the basic mechanisms behind the transport in large qd arrays , therefore , these systems are the best starting point in order to extend the methodology to larger systems .",
    "we start with the case of two qd in a parallel configuration .",
    "we use two qd of different radius in order to obtain different optical transitions in each qd for a given incident photon .",
    "now , the rate equations for each energy level of the qds have three contributions ; the leads , the neighbor qd and the optical contributions . in fig .  [ paralelo]a )",
    "we show the i(v ) curve under different incident photon energy .",
    "these photons energies are related to the maximum absorption peaks , for @xmath93 and @xmath94 qds . in a previous study , we have demonstrated that in parallel configuration the total dark current trough the system is the sum of the individual qd terms @xcite . at low voltages ,",
    "the optical terms dominate in the rate equation and the obtained i(v ) curve differs from the dark curve . as shown before",
    "( for one single qd ) , this trend is a competition between the optical transition probabilities and the transmission probabilities . for low voltages ,",
    "the barriers are not transparent enough .",
    "therefore , electron / holes are photo - generated in the qd changing the distribution function of the qd creating net fluxes incoming / outgoing from the qd to the leads .",
    "the electrons tend to move from the qd to leads and the holes follow the opposite direction , obtaining a net current if the currents are different .",
    "when the voltage increases , the barriers are bended and the tunneling probability increases as well . then , the optical term becomes smaller than the electrical terms and the dark trend is recovered .",
    "when the energy of the incident photon increases , the optical transitions involve the higher energy levels ( valence and conduction states for electron and holes respectively ) which have the maximum transmission probabilities increasing the current .",
    "+ moreover , in this case , the electrons can also move to the other qd . thus , a current between qds appears and breaks the symmetry respect to the leads obtaining a net current for the case v=0v ( fig .",
    "[ paralelo]b ) . as in the previous case ,",
    "when the polarization voltage increases the photo - current peaks tend to disappear .",
    "more peaks appear in the current term that take into account the photo - current generated in each qd since the two qds have different radii and the optical transitions occur at different photon energy .",
    "the third type of arrangement is two qd in a serial configuration . in previous works ,",
    "this kind of arrangement demonstrates the possibility of filtering the current trough the position of the energy levels @xcite .",
    "since overlapping between the energy levels of the qds is necessary , only a few conduction channels are opened and the current is strongly dependent on the electrostatic coupling of the qds obtaining ndr in the current - voltage curve @xcite .",
    "we proceed in a similar way as in the previous case , the electrical response under an external bias voltage and under illumination with different photon energy . in this configuration",
    ", each qd is connected to one electrode ( left and right ) and the neighbor qd .",
    "+ first of all , we present the obtained dark i(v ) and illuminated curve in fig .",
    "[ serie ] . in the dark case ,",
    "the ndr and current resonant peaks are obtained . the explanation related to these effects",
    "can be found elsewhere @xcite . when the light is applied , the current increases , since the occupation of the higher energy levels increase , making favorable the tunneling processes . for certain photon energies , the current saturates in a voltage region as the transitions involves the higher / lowest energy states of the conduction / valence band .",
    "overlapped to these optical transitions , we have the electronic transport due to the applied voltage . in order to obtain electronic transport between the qds",
    ", the condition of the overlapping of the energy levels has to be fulfilled . therefore the ndr and the current peaks still remain in the i(v ) curve .",
    "+ in addition , we present the photo - current generated as a function of the energy of the incident photon in fig .",
    "[ serie]b ) .",
    "the values of the photon energy have been chosen in order to maximize the transitions probabilities in each qd obtaining different photo generation rates in each dot .",
    "the cases under external bias voltages are also presented .",
    "we obtain a similar trend as in the previous cases , the current reflects the absorption spectra of the systems obtaining current peaks when the transitions probabilities are maximal in the cases when the photon energy equals the difference between the energy levels involved in the transition . as a difference as in the previous cases , the current saturates when the voltage is increased as a consequence of the no overlapping between the energy levels of the qds . for these reason",
    ", we study this kind of system ; a small qd ( with few energy levels ) connected in series with a bigger one ( with large number of energy levels ) .",
    "therefore , the small qd dominates the behavior of the photo - current since it controls the number of conduction channels . in this configuration , the photo - current retains the current peaks when the external voltage increases since the small qd acts as a current filter .      to conclude , we present the comparison between the presented theoretical model and a real system .",
    "the experimental results have been taken from prins et al .",
    "they fabricated a system based in two electrodes separated by 4 nm .",
    "a single layer of pbse qd of 2 nm in radius was deposited on top of the electrodes .",

    "the simulated curves follow the trends of the experimental ones in both cases , in dark and with light .",
    "the simulated curve still retains the step behavior but when the system becomes bigger and there is a random size distribution of qds the current contributions of each qd is summed and the plateaus disappear .",
    "moreover , the theoretical curve reflects the asymmetry in the i(v ) .",
    "+    we also compute the normalized photo current in fig .",
    "[ comparacion2 ] and its comparison to prins et al .",
    "besides , we represent the total simulated absorption coefficient of the system . concerning the absorption coefficient the simulated reproduces successfully the experimental measurements trend .",

    "+ the main goal of the presented transport methodology is that it can be improved using density of states @xcite or absorption coefficients @xcite derived from powerful techniques as dft making suitable a detailed description of the qds .",
    "the next generation of optoelectronic devices based on the singular properties of the qds embedded in an insulator matrix poses new requirements on theoretical models in order to describe their response .",
    "we propose a theoretical framework based on the non - coherent rate equations combined with the transfer hamiltonian approach to explain the transport properties of these kinds of systems in the self - consistent field regime . within this approach ,",
    "the rate equations were modified to take into account the optical processes , stimulated generation and recombination . moreover ,",
    "the whole methodology presented here is only dependent on basic material parameters and the geometry of the device .",
    "+ this approach has been used to study the electrical response of three systems : one single qd , two qds in parallel configuration and two qd in serial configuration .",
    "an important result emerges from the geometrical disposition of the qds respect to the leads , obtaining that the generated photo - current is zero if the qd is symmetrically coupled to the leads for the v=0 case .",
    "+ moreover , the methodology has been used to compare with experimental results .",
    "the simulated i(v ) curves in dark and under illumination conditions can reproduce in a general trend the experimental observations , making possible the use of this model as a guideline to design new opto - electronic devices .",
