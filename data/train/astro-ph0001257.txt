    "one of the primary objectives of the soho mission is the identification of the source and acceleration mechanisms of the fast solar wind . although polar coronal holes and regions with open magnetic field configuration were recognized long ago to be at the origin of the fast wind , the paucity of direct coronal hole observations from space in the long interval between the skylab and soho missions prevented in the last two decades a real progress in studying how the fine structure of coronal holes regulates coronal expansion .",
    "polar plumes , that are the most prominent features in polar coronal holes , and inter  plume regions have both been proposed to play an important role in the generation of the high  speed wind ( e.g. , ahmad and withbroe , 1977 ; wang , 1994 ) .",
    "soho observations have confirmed that plumes are denser , cooler and less dynamic structures than the surrounding regions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless they are site of quasi ",
    "periodic compressional waves @xcite , identified as slow magnetosonic ones that however can carry only a fraction ( @xmath32@xmath410@xmath5  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath1 ) of the energy required to accelerate the fast solar wind , @xmath310@xmath7  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ) onboard soho , is the first instrument that can allow us to determine the outflow velocity of the wind plasma in the outer corona and therefore to distinguish between the dynamic conditions of plumes and surrounding regions , at the height where the wind velocity has become significant .",
    "the results of such an analysis performed on the basis of the doppler dimming of the o  vi @xmath2  1032 , 1037   , detected in the period april 69 , 1996 , are reported in the present paper .",
    "preliminary results of this study are found in the ph.d .",
    "thesis by @xcite .",
    "in the first detailed observation of the ultraviolet emission of a coronal hole above 1.5  r@xmath0 , performed at solar minimum with uvcs during april 69 , 1996 , the polar region was scanned over an interval of 72  hours , starting on april 6 , 1996 at 07:22  ut .",
    "the instantaneous field of view ( 29  arcminx14  arcsec ) , centered on the north pole , was moved by 14  arcsecond steps in the radial direction , thus ensuring a continuous coverage of the corona between 1.45 to 2.48  r@xmath0 . for each spatial element , 14``x14 '' , the two o  vi lines , at @xmath8  1031.91   and @xmath8  1037.61   were detected with spectral resolution of 0.2   , and integration time of 3600  seconds .",
    "the raw data are calibrated according to the standard procedure @xcite .",
    "the o  vi line profiles are then fitted with a function resulting from the convolution of a gaussian function , for the solar spectral profile , with the voigt curve describing the instrumental broadening , and a function accounting for the width of the slit @xcite .",
    "the best fit is obtained by adjusting as free parameters standard deviation , @xmath9 , mean wavelength , @xmath10 , and peak , @xmath11 , of the solar profile .",
    "the observed line intensity is then the integral @xmath12 .    in the o  vi images of the polar hole observed on april 69 ,",
    "plumes are clearly identified at least up to 2  r@xmath0 .",
    "four main plumes are present within @xmath1314@xmath14 from the north pole , as the o  vi  1032 image shows in figure  1 .",
    "they appear as bright broad features , dimming with heliodistance .",
    "since the observation time to scan the corona out to 2  r@xmath0 is 1.4 days , plumes are either fairly stable or they tend to form again in almost the same position . in 1.4 days the displacement of the plumes due to solar rotation is negligible . their width at 1.7  r@xmath0 is roughly 5@xmath410@xmath1510@xmath16  cm . outside the central region , @xmath17 ,",
    "plumes are weaker and fewer as shown by the intensity along the heliocentric circumference with radius 1.7  r@xmath0 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "aim of the analysis is to determine the solar wind velocity in plumes and surrounding regions , including inter ",
    "plume lanes and darker areas of lower plume population , outside @xmath1314@xmath14 , that is , background coronal hole regions , with the intent of identifying the source of the high  speed wind .",
    "therefore the different regions are studied at a height 1.7  r@xmath0 , where plumes are still well identified and the wind has acquired on the average a sufficiently high velocity , @xmath18  100  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .    the plume emission is averaged over the brightest peaks within @xmath1314@xmath14 identified as dark segments in figure  2 , and the lane emission is averaged over the dimmest regions ( dashed segments in figure  2 ) .",
    "the emission of dark background regions is averaged outside the interval @xmath1314@xmath14 .",
    "the background average heliodistance , 1.82  r@xmath0 , is higher than that of plumes and inter  plume lanes , 1.72  r@xmath0 .",
    "the solar wind velocity relative to the three different regimes that have been identified , plume , inter  plume lanes and dark background , is then measured by determining the outflow velocity of the oxygen ions through the ratio of the doppler dimmed o  vi  @xmath8  1032 and @xmath8  1037   resonance lines @xcite .    in the outer corona",
    "these lines are emitted both via collisional excitation of the coronal ions and via resonant scattering of photons coming from the transition region .",
    "the second process is of increasing importance as the corona becomes more rarefied . in the frame of reference of the expanding solar wind",
    "the relative wavelength shift of incident photons and coronal absorbing profiles , causes a dimming of the resonant emission that is a function of the outflow velocity @xcite .",
    "the wind velocity can then be determined by the intersections of the observed o  vi intensity ratios with the emissivity ratios curves calculated with the code by @xcite , for the coronal conditions observed , or inferred , at 1.7  r@xmath0 . in a spherical symmetric corona ,",
    "the ratios of the emissivities on the plane of the sky closely approximates the line intensity ratios @xcite .",
    "the electron temperature , @xmath19 , is deduced from the soho observations that indicate values that remain below 1@xmath410@xmath20  k in a coronal hole and decrease above 1.15  r@xmath0 @xcite . a rare measurement in a bright plume , at 1.6  r@xmath0 , yields a 4@xmath410@xmath7  k temperature @xcite . higher coronal temperature values are determined on the basis of in  situ charge state ionization measurements , performed with swics / ulysses , which are however derived in the assumption of slow wind @xcite . here",
    ", we assume the temperature roughly equal to 3@xmath410@xmath7  k at 1.7  r@xmath0 for both plumes and surrounding regions .",
    "the wind velocity results do not change in any significant way if a higher temperature , e.g. 1@xmath410@xmath20  k , is assumed outside plumes .",
    "the plume electron density is derived from white light observations performed during minimum solar activity in 1996 @xcite .",
    "since the inter  plume and background region density is not explicitly given in that paper , it is assumed to be equal to the quiet coronal hole ( table  1 ) .",
    "the ratio of the plume and inter ",
    "plume density is consistent with the values published by @xcite .",
    "the o  vi coronal absorbing profiles along the line  of  sight are directly measured with uvcs .",
    "the width of the ion velocity distribution along the line  of  sight , @xmath21 , is equivalent to the kinetic temperature , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath24 is the ion mass .",
    "table  2 reports the observed intensity ratios , @xmath25 , of the ovi  1037 to the ovi  1032 line and the observed kinetic temperature of the o  vi ions along the line  of  sight , @xmath26 , together with the average heliodistance of the plume , inter  plume and background regions .",
    "the observed @xmath26 values ( table  2 ) confirm that the width of the ion velocity distribution is broader in lanes and background regions than in plumes @xcite .    in the computation of the o  vi emissivity the ion velocity distribution is considered to be bi  maxwellian . since the broadening of the o  vi lines in regions of open magnetic field lines is much larger than expected on the basis of ion  proton and proton  electron thermal balance @xcite , it is reasonable to assume the width of the radial distribution ( perpendicular to the line  of  sight ) as a variable between two extreme cases , that is , oxygen  electron thermal balance along the radial direction and isotropic distribution , respectively",
    ". furthermore , the existence of a degree of anisotropy in the oxygen velocity distribution is proven at least above 1.8  r@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the emissivity ratios are then computed both for the radial velocity distribution characterized by @xmath27 , ( i.e. maximum of anisotropy , corresponding to oxygen ions and electrons in thermal equilibrium along the radial direction ) in figure  3 , and by @xmath28 , ( i.e. isotropic velocity distribution ) in figure  4 . calculated and observed emissivity ratio of the o  vi lines are compared to derive the outflow velocity .",
    "the expansion velocity , derived from the intersection of the emissivity ratio curve with the observed o  vi ratio , in figure  3 and 4 , has not a unique value because of the lack of information on the radial ion velocity distribution , but it falls within a higher limit derived for isotropic oxygen velocity distribution and a lower value for the anisotropic case .",
    "it is immediately obvious from the inspection of figure  3 and 4 , that lanes between plumes and dimmer background regions outside @xmath29 are the privileged sites for the fast solar wind acceleration . in these regions , at 1.7  r@xmath0 , the fast solar wind has already reached speeds above 100  km  s@xmath1 , while the plasma in plumes is either expanding slowly or remains almost static . in lanes the outflow velocity is between 105  km  s@xmath1 and 150  km  s@xmath1 , and in darker regions between 110  km  s@xmath1 and 180  km  s@xmath1 for anisotropic and isotropic ion velocity distribution , respectively ( table  3 ) .",
    "these values are of the order of the average outflow velocity detected from the o  vi line emission integrated along the instantaneous field  of  view , at this height , which is between 100  km  s@xmath1 and 125  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the tendency to measure higher velocity in the darker background regions might reflect the fact that they are located on the average at higher heliodistances , where the wind is faster .",
    "the errors of the outflow velocity derived for isotropy are larger because in this case the derivative of the emissivity ratio is smaller than in the case of anisotropy , as shown in figure  3 and 4 .",
    "no significant outflow velocity can be found in plumes for isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "however if the distribution of the oxygen ion velocity deviates from isotropy , it is possible to detect a slow expansion at 65  km  s@xmath1 , much lower than that found for inter  plume lanes and background regions .",
    "as a result of the spectroscopic analysis of the ultraviolet emission from a solar minimum polar hole in the outer corona , we can therefore conclude that there is strong evidence that the fast solar wind is preferentially accelerated in inter  plume lanes and in the darker background regions of a polar coronal hole .",
    "it is interesting to note that these are also the regions where the o  vi line broadening is enhanced relative to that observed in plumes @xcite .    according to the uvcs results ( e.g. , kohl et al . , 1997a ) , the wind acceleration is higher where line profiles are broader . this fact has led to interpret the excess line broadening in terms of preferential heating of the oxygen ions related to preferential acceleration of the solar wind .",
    "the correlation of higher outflow velocity and broader line profiles outside the plumes is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "this does not contradict the model by @xcite , that invokes higher heating at the base of plumes , since the enhanced broadening of the oxygen lines in inter  plume lanes , evidence for preferential heating of the oxygen ions , is probably related to wave - particle interaction occurring higher up in the corona @xcite .",
    "the present results , that identify the regions surrounding plumes as the dominant sources of the high  speed solar wind , together with those recently obtained by @xcite and @xcite , who observed blue shifts at the base of polar coronal holes , suggesting that solar wind is emanating from regions along the boundaries of magnetic network cells , are finally indicating how to track back to the coronal base the fast solar wind velocity field lines .",
