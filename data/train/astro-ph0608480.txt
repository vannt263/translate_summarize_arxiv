    "it has long been recognized that the abundance of massive clusters of galaxies is a sensitive probe of density fluctuations in the universe .",
    "the cluster mass function can be used to derive interesting constraints on parameters that govern structure growth , in particular the normalization of the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations and the average mass density of the universe @xmath4 ( e.g. , evrard 1989 ; frenk et al .",
    "1990 ; henry & arnaud 1991 ; lilje 1992 ; white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; cen & ostriker 1994 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; henry 1997 ; oukbir & blanchard 1997 ; bahcall & fan 1998 ; pen 1998 ; viana & liddle 1999 ; henry 2000 ) .",
    "if the matter - energy density in the universe is dominated by a dark energy component , structure growth is hindered when this component becomes dynamically important .",
    "the resulting effect on the evolution of the cluster mass function makes it an interesting probe of dark energy ( e.g. , wang & steinhardt 1998 ; haiman , mohr , & holder 2001 ; levine , schulz , & white 2002 ; munshi , porciani , & wang 2004 ; henry 2004 ; majumdar & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "being a sensitive probe of the growth factor , cluster abundances might be combined with probes of the expansion history such as the magnitude - redshift relation for type ia supernovae to constrain photon - axion oscillations ( e.g. , cski , kaloper , & terning 2005 ) or even modifications to gravity arising in brane - world cosmologies ( lue , scoccimarro , & starkman 2004 ) .",
    "finally , cluster abundances can provide limits on the level of non - gaussianity in the primordial density perturbations ( scoccimarro , sefusatti , & zaldarriaga 2004 ; mathis , diego , & silk 2004 ) .",
    "many current studies use the x - ray temperature function ( xtf ) or the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of galaxy clusters as proxies for the mass function ( e.g. , pierpaoli et al .",
    "2001 ; ikebe et al .",
    "2002 ; reiprich & bhringer 2002 ; seljak 2002 ; allen et al .  2003 ; pierpaoli et al .  2003 ; viana et al .  2003",
    "; henry 2004 ; stanek et al .",
    "2006 ) . assuming that the x - ray emitting intra - cluster medium ( icm )",
    "is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium , the observed x - ray temperatures @xmath5 and luminosities @xmath6 can be simply related to cluster masses . however , this assumption is not always valid , as some clusters have complex temperature structures due to ongoing merging events ( e.g. , henry & briel 1995 ; henriksen & markevitch 1996 ; pratt , bhringer , & finoguenov 2005 ) .",
    "a significant spatial offset between the peaks of the x - ray emission from the icm and the corresponding concentrations of ( collision - less ) dark matter is observed in some of these systems ( clowe , gonzalez , & markevitch 2004 ; jee et al .",
    "simulations indicate that major mergers will temporarily boost icm temperatures and luminosities significantly above their equilibrium values and thereby significantly alter the observed xtf and xlf ( e.g. , randall , sarazin , & ricker 2002 ) .",
    "this could potentially bias constraints on cosmological parameters , if the resulting scatter around the xtf and xlf is not precisely determined for clusters in the high - mass tail of the distribution ( i.e. , if the box sizes of the simulations are too small to adequately sample the most massive clusters ) .",
    "these problems can be remedied by obtaining independent values for the cluster masses through measurements of gravitational lensing , which do not rely on assumptions about the dynamical state of the clusters .",
    "a set of lensing - derived cluster masses can then be used to empirically calibrate the normalization and scatter in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 relations ( e.g. , allen et al .  2003 ; smith et al .",
    "2005 ; pedersen & dahle 2006 ) .",
    "still , the complicated gas processes in merging clusters may plausibly lead to a significantly asymmetric dispersion about the mean relations which can not be adequately probed by the limited current data sets of clusters with both good x - ray and lensing data .",
    "a different strategy is to derive the cluster mass function directly from lensing masses .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that it should in principle avoid the problem of relating any observables of the baryonic cluster component to actual cluster mass ( in practice , however , such issues are still relevant whenever the cluster sample is selected based on baryonic tracers of mass , but at a less problematic level ) .",
    "this approach requires lensing masses for a large sample of clusters with well - understood selection criteria .",
    "samples from cluster surveys that efficiently pick out the extremely rare , most massive clusters in a large volume are most suitable , since the high - mass end of the mass function is most sensitive to cosmological parameters .",
    "also , given the current level of statistical and systematic uncertainties in lensing measurements , very massive systems are needed to produce a useful lensing signal from individual clusters .",
    "however , the lensing measurements are subject to projection effects that provide an additional source of error , and need to be calibrated to reasonable precision , e.g. using n - body simulations ( e.g. , clowe , de lucia , & king 2004 ) .    here",
    ", we present the first attempt to constrain the cluster mass function by using weak gravitational lens measurements directly .",
    "our results are only dependent on observables of the baryonic component of the clusters in the sense that the clusters were selected based on their x - ray luminosity .",
    "we describe our sample selection in   [ sec : sample ] , and in   [ sec : massfun ] we describe in detail how we use our mass measurements to derive the mass function .",
    "particular emphasis is put on the treatment of statistical and systematic errors and how these affect our results .    throughout this paper",
    "we will assume a spatially - flat cosmology with @xmath9 .",
    "numbers are generally given for the `` concordance model '' case ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) = ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the hubble parameter is generally given by @xmath14 ( however , in the discussion of the @xmath7 relation we use @xmath15 for easy comparison to results in the literature ) .",
    "cluster surveys based on photometric and spectroscopic followup of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; trmper 1993 ) using optical telescopes are currently the most efficient strategy for constructing representative samples of very massive clusters .",
    "these surveys cover large volumes , but are not restricted to optically selected objects such as the clusters in the catalogs of abell ( 1958 ) and abell , corwin , & olowin ( 1989 ) , which are seriously incomplete in the redshift interval relevant for this work ( briel & henry 1993 ) .",
    "the cluster sample used here was selected from a larger sample of x - ray luminous clusters of galaxies which were imaged using monolithic @xmath16 ccd detectors and/or the @xmath17 uh8k mosaic ccd camera .",
    "we obtained @xmath18- and @xmath19-band imaging data for the clusters using the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope on la palma , canary islands , spain and the 2.24 m university of hawaii telescope at mauna kea observatory , hawaii , usa .",
    "exposure times were typically 1.5h in each passband with the @xmath16 detectors and 3.5h in each passband with the less sensitive uh8k camera .",
    "the seeing was in the range @xmath20 in both pass - bands , with a mean seeing of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the @xmath19-band and @xmath18-band , respectively .",
    "for the weak lensing analysis , background galaxies were selected based on signal to noise ratio rather than magnitude , the limits corresponding to the magnitude ranges @xmath23 and @xmath24 for point sources .",
    "the typical number density of lensed sources was @xmath25 galaxies per square arcminute , and we found a `` figure of merit '' value ( defined by kaiser 2000 ) of @xmath26deg@xmath27 .",
    "further details about the observations , data reduction and weak lensing analysis are given elsewhere ( dahle et al .",
    "2002 ; h. dahle 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the reduction procedures for mosaic ccd data followed the techniques described by kaiser et al .",
    "the clusters used here represent a volume - limited sample of x - ray luminous clusters taken from the rass - based , x - ray flux limited rosat brightest cluster sample ( bcs ) of ebeling et al .  ( 1998 ) and its low - flux extension ( ebcs ; ebeling et al .",
    ". we will hereafter refer to them collectively as the ( e)bcs sample .",
    "we chose a lower cutoff in x - ray luminosity of @xmath28 erg s@xmath29 ( limit given for a concordance model universe with @xmath30 ) .",
    "as discussed in   [ sec : compl ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : mlrel ] , this cutoff approximately corresponds to a lower cutoff in mass of @xmath31 .",
    "following white ( 2002 ) , we denote as @xmath32 the mass contained inside the cluster radius @xmath33 within which the average density is 180 times the critical density of the universe @xmath34 at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the estimated overall completeness of the bcs sample within its x - ray flux limit is 90% , and the completeness of the ebcs sample is estimated to be 75% ( ebeling et al .",
    "1998 ; 2000 ) .",
    "the selected clusters lie within the redshift range @xmath35 .",
    "there are 35 ( e)bcs clusters that fall within the given limits ( and also do not have their x - ray signal significantly contaminated by point sources ) , and we have made weak lensing measurements of all of these ( see table  [ tab : bcssample ] ) .",
    "another cluster with a high lensing mass , cl 1821 + 643 ( wold et al .",
    "2002 ) , is located within the survey volume , but it was omitted from the ( e)bcs samples because of the presence of a strong agn point source in the cluster .",
    "bhringer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find the occurrence of such agn point source contamination in a large x - ray selected cluster sample at similar redshifts to be less than 5% , so we do not expect to miss more than 1 - 2 additional clusters in our sample from this effect . furthermore , such cases are accounted for in the bcs and ebcs completeness estimates quoted above , and we therefore chose not to include a weak lensing mass measurement for cl 1821 + 643 in our sample .    ebeling et al .",
    "( 1998 ; 2000 ) identified the majority of their ( e)bcs clusters from the data base produced by running the standard software analysis system ( sass ) on the rass data ( voges 1992 ) .",
    "the sass data have a total exposure time of 360s with the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) , this exposure time being constant across the sky .",
    "photon event table ( pet ) files were extracted in a @xmath36 region centered on each of the sass - based cluster candidates . in some cases ( particularly near the ecliptic poles )",
    "the pet fields ( which contain all the rass photons collected in the region ) are significantly deeper than the sass data , which led to serendipitous discoveries of additional clusters using a voronoi tessellation and percolation algorithm ( for full details , see ebeling et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the bcs and ebcs completeness values quoted above are average values ; for both samples there is a small minority of clusters that are serendipitous detections , and have much lower completeness values associated with them .",
    "this is the case for two clusters in our sample ( a1576 and zw5247 ) . for each cluster ,",
    "we list the estimated completenesses , calculated from the completeness associated with the relevant ( e)bcs cluster detection method , in table  [ tab : bcssample ] .",
    "a number of steps , detailed below , are required to convert weak gravitational lensing measurements for a set of clusters into an observed mass function which can be compared to predictions from theory or n - body simulations .",
    "firstly , the total survey volume is calculated for a range of cosmologies , and lensing estimates of the cluster mass within a spherical volume are derived .",
    "the effects of sample incompleteness should be taken into account , arising both from incompletenesses in our original cluster catalog ( discussed in the preceding section ) and the mass - dependent incompleteness caused by the observed scatter around the @xmath37 relation , coupled with applying a sharp lower cutoff in @xmath6 .",
    "another important correction comes from uncertainties in the cluster mass estimates , which will tend to artificially increase the number of clusters in the high - mass tail of the observed mass function .",
    "the ( e)bcs survey area consists of the northern celestial hemisphere ( @xmath38 ) , minus a `` zone of avoidance '' at galactic latitudes @xmath39 , where high galactic extinction may seriously decrease the depth of followup optical extragalactic observations .",
    "the survey volume is bounded in redshift by @xmath35 . for the case of the concordance cosmological model",
    ", this represents a volume of @xmath40 .      for our weak lensing analysis",
    ", we used the shear estimator of kaiser ( 2000 ) .",
    "this method was tested , along with several other shear estimators , by heymans et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , using simulated weak lensing data .",
    "the shear estimator of kaiser ( 2000 ) is more mathematically rigorous than the currently most widely used shear estimator ( kaiser , squires , & broadhurst 1995 ) , but it displays a significant non - linear response to shear , unlike most other shear estimators . if we correct our measurements using a second order polynomial in the difference between measured and true shear , as found by heymans et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we find that most cluster masses stay within @xmath41% of the mass calculated from uncorrected shear values .",
    "furthermore , the change in average cluster mass is @xmath42% , i.e. , there is very little systematic shift in mass .",
    "given the modest size of the correction , and the fact that it would ( for a few clusters ) require extrapolations outside the range of shear values over which the shear estimator has been tested , we chose not to apply this correction .",
    "the galaxy shape distortions caused by gravitational lensing provides a measurement of the reduced tangential shear , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the tangential component of the shear and @xmath45 is the convergence .",
    "the average value of @xmath46 is measured in a set of non - overlapping annuli with mean radius @xmath47 , centered on the mass center of the cluster .",

    "for derivations of the lensing properties of the nfw model , we refer the reader to the papers of bartelmann ( 1996 ) and wright & brainerd ( 2000 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : mlrel ] also seems to indicate a flattening of the @xmath37 slope at very high x - ray luminosities ( @xmath90 erg s@xmath29 ) , similar to the change of the slope of the @xmath8 relation at high temperatures noted by cypriano et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in both cases , this is most likely caused by a scattering of out - of - equilibrium clusters into the extreme tails of the xtf and xlf , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "we also tried fixing the slope parameter at the value @xmath91 predicted from a self - similar collapse model for galaxy clusters ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "our fit to the relation in eq .",
    "[ eq : theoryml ] then gave a normalization @xmath92 .",
    "this is consistent with the relation similarly derived from a sample of 17 clusters by allen et al .",
    "these authors used a combination of x - ray based mass measurements derived from _",
    "data for a set of 10 clusters they had classified as relaxed systems , and weak lensing - based mass measurements for a partially overlapping sample of 10 clusters , including some unrelaxed systems .",
    "since @xmath6 is our only cluster selection criterion , we have not here attempted to classify clusters according to their dynamical state .    when accounting for the additional scatter about this relation caused by the mass measurement uncertainties , a scatter of @xmath93 is found . by comparison ,",
    "the data presented by reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 ) indicate an intrinsic scatter of @xmath94 about the @xmath7 relation , using x - ray based mass estimates under the assumptions of isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium of the intra - cluster gas .",
    "more recently , smith et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found an intrinsic scatter @xmath95 about their @xmath7 relation , based on gravitational lensing measurements of the masses of 10 clusters within a cluster - centric radius of @xmath96 kpc .",
    "the slightly larger scatter we measure could be a result of the larger uncertainties of @xmath6 values determined from rass data , compared to deeper pointed x - ray observations of clusters .    for a given cluster of true mass @xmath32 ,",
    "the probability of being included in our sample is    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the probability distribution of @xmath32 for a given x - ray luminosity and @xmath99 is the mass corresponding ( via eq .",
    "[ eq : theoryml ] ) to the cutoff in x - ray luminosity @xmath100 erg s@xmath29 . here , @xmath98 is assumed to be a log - normal function ( analogous to the scatter about the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation ; see novicki , sornig , & henry 2002 ) , for which we derive a standard deviation in @xmath101 of @xmath102 , based on the data plotted in figure  [ fig : mlrel ] .",
    "we note that the exact form of @xmath98 should be determined empirically in the future , using even larger data sets of x - ray luminous clusters with more accurately determined lensing masses .    to make our subsequent analysis self - consistent ,",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath99 was determined for the range of spatially - flat cosmologies probed in this study ; its value at the mean cluster redshift ( @xmath103 ) for the concordance model is @xmath104 .",
    "a significant uncertainty is associated with any realistic cluster mass estimator . in the case of gravitational lensing - based mass measurements ,",
    "uncertainties arise both from the measurement uncertainties of the observable itself and from the intrinsic scatter in the mass - observable relation caused by projection effects . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : massest ] , the former is dominant for most of the clusters in our data sample , but there is also a non - negligible contribution from the latter . given these uncertainties ,",
    "extra care must be taken to remove possible biases produced by the exponential falloff of the mass function at high masses . if the uncertainties in @xmath32 were the same for all the clusters , they could simply be incorporated by convolving the theoretical mass function with a probability distribution @xmath105 , with a width given by the uncertainties ( e.g. , evrard 1989 ; metzler et al .",
    "however , as shown in table  [ tab : bcssample ] , the uncertainties vary significantly from cluster to cluster . hence , the theoretical mass function is convolved with the uncertainty of each cluster , and the average of the resulting ensemble of mass functions is calculated and used in our further analysis .    given a theoretical mass function @xmath106 , and given the total measurement uncertainties in the weak lensing estimates of @xmath32 , the observed mass function can be predicted as :    @xmath107    where @xmath105 is a log - normal probability distribution of width given by the measurement uncertainty in @xmath32 , and the average is taken over the ensemble of observed uncertainties @xmath108 .",
    "finally , we note that @xmath32 , @xmath108 , and @xmath99 are all cosmology - dependent quantities , and to make our analysis self - consistent , these need to be re - calculated for each cosmology .",
    "a number of studies have predicted the mass function of dark matter halos using an analytic approach or via numerical simulations .",
    "the formalism of press & schechter ( 1974 ) uses linear theory for the evolution of self - gravitating mass density fluctuations and assumes a gaussian distribution of inhomogeneities to calculate the fraction of the volume which has reached a given over - density for a given smoothing scale , assuming that all objects at a spherical over - density above a threshold value @xmath109 undergo gravitational collapse .",
    "the mass function derived via press - schechter theory provides overall a reasonable match to mass functions derived from n - body simulations of cdm particles , over a wide range of masses ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "however , the mass functions derived from simulations still show significant departures from the press - schechter form , yielding a larger number of clusters at the high - mass end ( e.g. , jenkins et al .",
    "sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) showed that a modification of press - schechter theory to allow for ellipsoidal , rather than spherical , collapse gave a significantly improved fit to the simulations , similar to the form suggested by sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "recently , warren et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used a new , larger set of simulations and found that the mass functions introduced by jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) deviate by @xmath110 from their simulations at the highest masses .",
    "they therefore provide a new formula for the mass function shape .    based on these results , we chose to fit our cluster data to two mass function forms ; one which is consistent with the most recent simulations ( warren et al .",
    "2006 ) , and one which is more directly based on analytical work ( sheth & tormen 1999 ) .",
    "jenkins et al .  ( 2001 ) and white ( 2002 ) showed that the shape of the mass function is universal across the range of currently interesting cosmologies , given that the halo mass ( @xmath111 ) is always defined within a volume of average over - density @xmath112 with respect to the mean ( rather than critical ) matter density of the universe . in the case of the simulations , warren et al .",
    "( 2006 ) remark that the commonly used `` friends - of - friends '' halo definition method tends to select halos of a different average over - density , which depends on the number of particles in the simulated halo . for the most massive halos ,",
    "the halo mass is @xmath113 , i.e. , corresponding to an average halo over - density @xmath114 .",
    "we convert the mass function predictions of warren et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) to @xmath32 ( from @xmath113 and @xmath111 , respectively ) , using the fitting function in appendix c of hu & kravtsov ( 2003 ) , based on the procedure outlined by white ( 2001 ) .",
    "we assume a structure parameter fixed at @xmath115 .    for easy comparison between theory and observations , we binned the theoretical mass function , such that the predicted number of clusters in the ith bin would be    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the bcs survey volume defined in ",
    "[ sec : survey volume ] . for the theoretical mass functions , we calculated the predicted number of observed clusters in four mass bins ( of widths 5 , 5 , 5 , and @xmath118 , respectively ) , ranging from @xmath119 to @xmath120 . in the end",
    ", we only used the three uppermost mass bins , since the uncertainties of the lowest mass bin will be very large , and completely dominated by uncertainties in the incompleteness correction , given the small degree of sample completeness in this mass range . in the lowest bin , the incompleteness correction will be highly sensitive to the scatter around the mean @xmath37 relation . as shown in   [ sec : compl ] , the sample selection cutoff in @xmath6 corresponds to a lower cutoff in mass of @xmath31 . to account for poisson shot noise , @xmath121 errors",
    "are applied to the counts of clusters in each mass bin .",
    "additional uncertainties arise from the cluster mass measurement uncertainties , resulting in a non - negligible probability that a cluster is counted in the wrong bin .",
    "these errors are added in quadrature to the poisson errors .",
    "in addition , @xmath121 errors are applied to the theoretically predicted cluster counts in each bin , to account for cosmic variance .",
    "fitting to the theoretical mass function of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) , we find @xmath2 ( @xmath3 confidence limits ) , while a similar fit to the mass function of warren et al .",
    "( 2006 ) gives @xmath122 .",
    "there is a tendency for a preference for higher @xmath123 values in the higher mass bins ; the uppermost mass bin alone gives a best fit @xmath124 for @xmath125 , using the mass function of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "this may hint towards an overestimate of the sample completeness in the lower mass bins .",
    "stanek et al .  ( 2006 ) discusses the effect of malmquist bias on x - ray flux - limited cluster samples in the presence of large intrinsic scatter around the @xmath126 relation and suggest that the true normalization of this relation is a factor of 2 dimmer than estimated from the rass - based hiflugcs sample of reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 ) .",
    "applying a shift of this magnitude to the @xmath127 relation derived in   [ sec : compl ] ( while keeping the estimated level of scatter , which is consistent with the scatter estimated by stanek et al .",
    "2006 ) would increase the value of @xmath99 ( to @xmath128 , in the case of the concordance model ) and increase the incompleteness correction factors in each mass bin , yielding a best fit @xmath129 , based on the three uppermost mass bins .",
    "however , since the sample of 50 clusters used to derive the @xmath127 relation in ",
    "[ sec : compl ] can be more accurately described as a volume - limited rather than flux - limited sample , this malmquist bias correction should not be applicable to our sample .",
    "it should be noted that the magnitude of the uncertainties in the gravitational lensing mass measurements of the clusters , including the three additional sources of mass scatter discussed in   [ sec : massest ] , has a significant effect on the derived cosmological parameters ( see e.g. , lima & hu 2005 for a discussion of a similar effect on dark energy constraints from high - redshift clusters ) .",
    "the effect of the scatter is to populate the high - mass tail of the cluster mass function with some of the ( far more numerous ) lower - mass clusters which have been scattered upwards in mass . as an example",
    ", if we artificially reduce the scatter in mass in our data by 30% ( as would be the effect of ignoring the effect of mass scatter from variations in the nfw concentration parameter , variations in cluster galaxy contamination and projection effects ) , the best fit value of @xmath123 for the concordance model would increase from @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "hence , a decrease in the mass uncertainties works in the opposite direction as an decrease in the mass values , so that these will partially cancel each other out if the cluster masses and mass uncertainties are multiplied by the same factor .",
    "this makes our @xmath123 result fairly robust to e.g.  a modest multiplicative error in the shear estimator .",
    "the results presented in this paper demonstrate that weak gravitational lensing based measurements of cluster abundances provide competitive constraints in the @xmath123-@xmath10 plane . in a recent work ( pedersen & dahle 2006 ) , @xmath123 was estimated by measuring the normalization of the mass - x ray temperature relation of galaxy clusters . if the intrinsic scatter about the mass - temperature relation is low ( 10% or less ) , as this normalization implies a higher value of @xmath132 for @xmath125 .",
    "while most theoretical studies predict a rather tight mass - temperature relation , pedersen & dahle ( 2006 ) showed that the scatter about the relation is most likely larger than 10% , producing a @xmath123 estimate which is systematically biased towards high values .",
    "hence , as remarked in their discussion , the @xmath123 estimate of pedersen & dahle ( 2006 ) should most accurately be regarded as an upper limit , and the true value is likely to be lower .",
    "being based directly on weak gravitational lensing mass estimates , the results presented here do not depend on knowing the mass - temperature relation and its scatter , and we obtain a lower value of @xmath130 for @xmath125 . as shown in figure  [ fig : bananaspergel ] our joint constraints on @xmath123 and @xmath10 agree very well with the 3-year wmap data ( spergel et al .",
    "the 3-year wmap data give a preference for @xmath123 and @xmath10 values lower than indicated by the first year wmap data , combined with large scale structure data from sdss ( tegmark et al .",
    "our result also agrees well with many estimates of cluster abundances based on x - ray data ( e.g. , reiprich & bhringer 2002 ; seljak 2002 ; viana , nichol , & liddle 2002 ; allen et al .  2003 ; henry 2004 ) , which have tended to produce @xmath123 values in the lower end of the range of published estimates .",
    "reiprich ( 2006 ) discusses cluster abundances in light of the 3-year wmap results , and gives best - fit results for @xmath123 and @xmath10 based on the hiflugcs cluster sample that agree very well with both wmap data and the results presented here .",
    "these results imply a lower value of @xmath123 than implied by `` cosmic shear '' measurements of weak gravitational lensing in random fields ( hoekstra et al .",
    "2005 ; semboloni et al .  2006 ; see figure  [ fig : bananaspergel ] ) .",
    "one possible source of systematic error in the results presented in this paper is the use of x - ray luminosity selected clusters to estimate the scatter about the mass - x - ray luminosity relation . some weak lensing studies ( e.g. , erben et al .",
    "2001 ; dahle et al .",
    "2003 ) may hint toward the existence of a class of x - ray under - luminous clusters , although detections of shear - selected clusters are significantly affected by projection effects ( white , van waerbeke , & mackey 2002 ; hennawi & spergel 2005 ) , and may include `` proto - clusters '' ( weinberg & kamionkowski 2002 ) that are still undergoing collapse and have not yet become fully virialised systems .",
    "the latter type of objects may pose less of a problem for the present study , since such systems should not be included when making the fit to a theoretically predicted mass function for fully collapsed systems .",
    "a sub - population of x - ray under - luminous clusters is also found by popesso et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , based on a correlation of abell clusters in the sdss database and rass sources . since these systems show signs of being in formation , still undergoing significant mass accretion , their relation to theoretically predicted abundances of virialised clusters is somewhat unclear .",
    "weak lensing surveys with the large sky coverage required to find statistically useful numbers of @xmath133 clusters are still some years into the future , but ongoing surveys ( miyazaki et al .  2003 ; hetterscheidt et al .  2005 ;",
    "gavazzi & soucail 2006 ; wittman et al .",
    "2006 ; schirmer et al .",
    "2006 ) are beginning to detect a significant number of lower - mass clusters based on weak gravitational shear .",
    "if there is indeed a large population of massive , x - ray under - luminous galaxy clusters , our estimates of sample incompleteness as a function of mass would be too low , implying a somewhat higher true value of @xmath123 .",
    "the constraints presented here may be improved in several ways in the near future : firstly , obtaining new wide - field imaging data for all the clusters in this sample will remove the need for extrapolation of an adopted mass model out to @xmath33 , removing one potential source of systematic error while significantly reducing the statistical errors on the mass measurements .",
    "furthermore , by obtaining imaging in a larger number of pass - bands , approximate photometric redshifts may be calculated , providing sufficient 3d information to distinguish the gravitationally lensed background galaxies from cluster and foreground galaxies .",
    "although we have made an attempt to correct for this effect by applying an average , radially dependent , contamination correction to all clusters ( and estimate the extra scatter caused by cluster richness variations ) , the true correction factor will of course depend on cluster richness and cluster redshift , and cluster substructure will cause it not to be a simple function of cluster radius . hence , the appropriate correction for individual clusters can differ significantly from the average correction calculated here ( see e.g. , broadhurst et al .",
    "future photometric redshift estimates of background galaxies , and the uncertainties in these estimates could also be included in a optimized weighting scheme ( e.g. , kaiser 2000 ; benitez 2000 ) , significantly improving the signal - to - noise ratio of the lensing mass measurements .",
    "the sample used in this study is restricted to galaxy clusters in the northern celestial hemisphere , and the sample size could easily be doubled by including clusters with similar x - ray selection criteria in in the southern hemisphere , e.g. , from the reflex sample of bhringer et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , thus improving the statistical errors .",
    "the sample could also be extended by lowering the x - ray luminosity cutoff @xmath134 , sampling the mass function at lower masses .",
    "for the ( e)bcs sample , such a low - luminosity extension of the cluster sample would be restricted to the near end of the redshift range probed here , since @xmath134 corresponds to the lower ebcs x - ray flux limit at the far end of the survey volume .",
    "however , more recent cluster surveys based on rass data ( e.g. , ebeling , edge , & henry 2001 ) go down to lower x - ray fluxes and would be useful for probing further down the mass function without restricting the survey volume . finally , by combining the data presented in this paper with a weak lensing survey of a similar cluster sample at higher redshifts , interesting constraints",
