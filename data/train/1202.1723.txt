    "milgrom ( 1983 ) proposed that the failure of galactic rotation curves to decline in keplerian fashion outside the galaxies luminous body arises not because galaxies are embedded in massive dark halos obeying newtonian gravity , but because newton s law of gravity has to be modified for fields that generate accelerations smaller than some characteristic value @xmath5 cm s@xmath6 .",
    "subsequently , in order to solve basic problems presented by this phenomenological formulation of the theory ( now known as modified newtonian dynamics or mond ) , such as conservation of linear momentum ( e.g. , felten 1984 ) , bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) substituted the heuristic model with the mond non - relativistic field equation @xmath7 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqmond}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the standard euclidean norm , @xmath9 is a scalar function , @xmath10 is the gravitational potential produced by the density distribution @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the mond gravitational field experienced by a test particle . for an isolated system of finite mass , eq .  ( [ eqmond ] )",
    "is supplemented with the natural boundary condition @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) is obtained from a variational principle applied to a lagrangian with all the required symmetries , so the standard conservation laws are obeyed . in the regime of intermediate accelerations",
    "the function @xmath9 is not fully constrained by theory or observations , while asymptotically @xmath15 a common choice is @xmath16 ( see also famaey & binney 2005 , zhao & famaey 2006 ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ eqmuasym ] ) it follows that eq .",
    "( [ eqmond ] ) reduces to the poisson equation when @xmath17 , while the limit equation @xmath18 describes systems for which ( or regions of space where ) @xmath19 , i.e. systems for which the mond predictions differ most from the newtonian ones .",
    "equation  ( [ eqdmond ] ) , characterizing the so - called `` deep mond regime '' ( hereafter dmond ) , is then of particular relevance in mond investigations , as this is the regime where one hopes to find the most significant differences with the predictions of newtonian gravity . from the mathematical point of view , the l.h.s .",
    "( [ eqdmond ] ) is a special case of the so - called @xmath20-laplace operator @xmath21 .",
    "the dmond case corresponds to @xmath22 , the so - called critical case for @xmath23 .",
    "a large body of mathematical literature is dedicated to the @xmath20-laplacian , but due to its non - linearity it is not surprising that several important questions are still open ( e.g. , see lindqvist & manfredi 2008 ) .",
    "we anticipate that the general results in the present paper are independent of the specific form of @xmath9 , because they just follow from the fact that @xmath9 is a function of @xmath24 , or they are obtained for the dmond regime .    a considerable body of observational data seems to support mond well beyond its originally intended field of application ( see , e.g. , milgrom 2002 , sanders & mcgaugh 2002 , famaey & mcgaugh 2011 ) , but potential problems of the theory have been pointed out by many authors ( see , e.g. the & white 1988 , buote et al .",

    ", the situation is in general considered unsettled .",
    "it is thus natural to study in detail mond predictions , in particular focusing on dmond systems , i.e. systems that in newtonian gravity would be dark matter dominated .",
    "unfortunately , mond investigations , especially on the theory side , have been considerably slowed down by the almost complete lack of aspherical density - potential pairs , needed to test the predictions in cases more realistic than those described by spherical symmetry . in mond ,",
    "the main difficulty to obtain exact aspherical density - potential pairs originates from the fact that a simple relation between the newtonian and the mond gravity fields , produced by an assigned density distribution , in general does not exist .",
    "in fact , the newtonian potential @xmath25 obeys the poisson equation @xmath26 so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 differ , for assigned @xmath11 , by a solenoidal field @xmath29 . in turn , the potential vector @xmath30 depends on @xmath11 , and so it is apriori unknown .",
    "the only exception is provided by density distributions in which the modulus @xmath31 of the newtonian field @xmath32 is stratified on surfaces of constant @xmath25 ( particularly simple cases are those of spherically and cylindrically symmetric densities , or densities stratified on homogeneous planes , see also brada & milgrom 1995 ; shan et al .",
    "in such cases @xmath33 vanishes , and @xmath34 equation  ( [ eqmug ] ) coincides with the original mond formulation of milgrom ( 1983 ) and can be solved algebraically for @xmath35 in terms of @xmath36 , just by taking its norm .",
    "a general method to build aspherical and exact mond density potential pairs is presented in ciotti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) where , by extending the homeoidal expansion technique introduced in ciotti & bertin ( 2005 ) for newtonian gravity , it is shown how a `` seed '' spherical potential can be deformed to an axisymmetric or triaxial shape , leading to analytical density - potential pairs satisfying the mond equation .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting density distributions are not fully under control in case of major departures from spherical symmetry , and regions of unphysical negative density may result .",
    "for these reasons here we explore a different approach , i.e. we focus on the possibility to extend to mond some of the remarkable results obtained in newtonian gravity for potentials separable in ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "this not only to better understand the properties of mond systems , but also to develop a new method to generate exact solutions deviating from spherical symmetry for the @xmath20-laplace operator . while we refer to other papers for the full account of separability in ellipsoidal coordinates ( de zeeuw 1985b , hereafter z85 ; de zeeuw & lynden - bell 1985 , hereafter zlb85 ) , here we just summarize the properties of newtonian separable potentials in ellipsoidal coordinates relevant to the present investigation .",
    "some of these properties are indeed shared by similar but non - separable families described in de zeeuw & pfenniger ( 1988 , hereafter zp88 ) .",
    "specifically , in newtonian separable systems :    \\1 . the potential along the long axis of the coordinate ellipsoids ( the @xmath4-axis in the standard convention ) is related to the density profile along this axis by a linear second order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) .",
    "this is the _",
    "kuzmin property_.",
    "for assigned density profile along the @xmath4-axis , the ode can be integrated completely .",
    "once the parameters of the ellipsoidal coordinate systems are fixed , the solution determines uniquely the potential ( and so the density ) over the whole space .",
    "the density elsewhere is related to that on the @xmath4-axis by the so - called _",
    "kuzmin formula_. usually , the @xmath4-axis is the _ short _ axis of the density distribution .",
    "the kuzmin formula shows that the density is everywhere non - negative if this holds along the short axis .",
    "this is the _",
    "kuzmin theorem_.",
    "the kuzmin formula also shows that density profiles that fall off along the @xmath4-axis faster than @xmath37 lead to finite mass .",
    "density profiles that fall off less steep than @xmath38 become spherical at large radii , while for @xmath39 or steeper the models have finite flattening at large radii .",
    "in particular , density profiles that fall off faster than @xmath38 lead to density distributions that in all other directions falls off as @xmath40 , so that such models are quasi - toroidal ( de zeeuw , peletier & franx 1986 ; zp88 ) .    of course , separable potentials are a special - albeit very important - class of potentials expressed in ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "the interest in separable potentials is that , once a supporting positive density can be found , then their orbital classification can be done exactly , and equally well in mond or in newtonian gravity .",
    "in addition , as we will briefly discuss in the conclusions , separable potentials may allow for a contructive approach towards the assembly of self - consistent mond modes , i.e. , collisionless systems supported by a positive phase - space distribution function obeying the jeans theorem ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1962 , binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "however , when considering the more general problem of obtaining a flexible approach to the construction of triaxial mond potential - density pairs , different classes of ( non - separable ) potentials still obeying the kuzmin property are worth to be explored , such as those described in zp88 .",
    "these models are not separable , but their simpler algebrical structure leads to simpler equations , that might be solved ( numerically ) more easily than in the separable case .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive the ode along the @xmath4-axis for separable models in the dmond regime , and then we extend the result to the full mond case , thus showing that the kuzmin property holds in mond . in section 3",
    "we derive the general asymptotic behavior at the center and at large radii of the density distributions generated by mond regular separable potentials .",
    "some explicit examples of everywhere positive densities associated with separable potentials are then presented in section 4 .",
    "a discussion of a special family of non - separable triaxial potentials ( the @xmath3 family of zp88 ) is carried out in section 5 , where among other findings it is shown that the kuzmin property holds also for @xmath3 systems .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in section 6 . in the appendix we list technical details , together with a brief discussion of the separable axisymmetric power - law models by sridhar & touma ( 1997 ) in the context of mond .",
    "we consider mass models that correspond to ( triaxial ) mond potentials for which the hamilton - jacobi equation separates in ellipsoidal coordinates @xmath41 , and investigate whether a kuzmin formula holds for them .",
    "this is not obvious , as the mond field equation is non - linear and considerably more complicated than the poisson equation .",
    "we recall that the most general form of a separable potential in ellipsoidal coordinates can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an arbitrary , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 may be allowed in separable potentials .",
    "smooth mass models require @xmath46 and @xmath47 together with conditions on the derivatives of these functions , so it is in most cases no loss of generality to take @xmath48 ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1962 , zlb85 ) . ]",
    "function ( z85 , zlb85 ) ; the relevant properties of ellipsoidal coordinates needed in the following discussion are summarized in appendix a.    it turns out that we can obtain information on the full mond case just by restricting to the simpler case of dmond systems , i.e. , by focusing on the properties of the @xmath20-laplacian .",
    "first , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eqdmond ] ) in the more convenient form @xmath49 where the explicit expression for the linear differential operator @xmath50 in terms of ellipsoidal coordinates is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dphi ] ) . the advantage of working with eq .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eqdmond ] ) is that one avoids the computation of the derivatives of a norm , with the involved square root .    in principle , by inserting eq .",
    "( [ phisep ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) , and using the formulae reported in the appendix , some heavy algebra will give the expression for the density distribution over the whole space as a function of @xmath51 , and its first and second order derivative , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "not unexpectedly , the resulting formula is quite formidable , and of little use . in practice ,",
    "given @xmath43 , the explicit computation can be performed by using one of the many available computer algebra packages , and some cases will be discussed in section 4 .    here instead we are interested in a more general property , i.e. if the kuzmin formula ( or even the kuzmin theorem ) holds also for mond separable systems . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ellcoo ] ) it follows that the density profile along the whole @xmath4-axis of a generic density distribution @xmath54 is given by the function @xmath55 where in the three intervals @xmath56 . in analogy with z85",
    "( see also kuzmin 1956 for the oblate axisymmetric case ) , we now show that the r.h.s .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) , evaluated on the @xmath4-axis , reduces in the three intervals of @xmath57 to the _ same _ second - order ode for the unknown function @xmath43 , thus proving that also in dmond the function @xmath58 determines @xmath43 , and so the density field everywhere . in other words , _ the kuzmin property ( and so a kuzmin - like formula ) holds also for separable dmond systems_.    let us consider the restriction of eq .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the laplace operator satisfies the kuzmin property , so there is nothing to prove , and its expression along the @xmath4-axis is given in eq .",
    "( 27 ) of z85 .",
    "an explicit computation then shows that the restriction to the @xmath4-axis of @xmath59 is given by the unique expression @xmath60 in the three intervals spanned by @xmath57 , where @xmath61 remarkably , we note that , with the exception of the factor @xmath62 , no irrationalities are involved in the expression of @xmath63 .",
    "of course , care is needed in the evaluation of this latter quantity , as it contains the absolute value @xmath64 .",
    "finally , some algebra shows that the restriction of @xmath65 to the @xmath4-axis also admits the unique representation @xmath66_z=-4||\\nabla\\phi ||_z^2 \\left [ { { \\cal n}}+2(\\tau+\\gamma){\\cal m}\\right ] , \\label{eq : dnormz}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 combining the previous results , we obtain the following second - order ode relating , for separable dmond systems , the density profile along the whole @xmath4-axis to @xmath43 : @xmath68_z-2{\\cal n}-4(\\tau+\\gamma){\\cal m }                                  \\right\\}. \\label{eq : odez}\\ ] ] thus , the preliminary result is that the kuzmin property holds in dmond ( i.e. , for the @xmath20-laplacian ) . _ furthermore , with the aid of the previous results it follows immediately , by restriction of eq .",
    "( [ eqmond ] ) to the @xmath4-axis , that the kuzmin property ( and in principle a kuzmin formula ) also holds for the full mond field equation , as the @xmath9 function in eq .",
    "( [ eqmond ] ) depends on @xmath24_. unfortunately , the non - linearity of the problem seems to prevent the construction of the explicit kuzmin formula even in dmond , so that the successive analysis of positivity of the density as in newtonian gravity ( z85 ) can not be performed , and the kuzmin theorem remains unproven .",
    "we conclude this general section by noticing that , as pointed out by the referee , a more general result on kuzmin property can in fact be obtained , encopassing the present results and those in section 5 . in practice , with some analytical work , it can be shown that the kuzmin property certainly hold in newtonian gravity and in mond for any potential that can be written as a symmetric function of ellipsoidal coordinates , i.e. , by a function invariant for the transformation @xmath69 .",
    "in the previous section we proved that mond systems with separable potentials in ellipsoidal coordinates obey the kuzmin property , and so in principle a kuzmin formula holds for them . before embarking on the study of the density distributions associated with specific separable potentials , we focus on the more general question of the asymptotic behavior of the density , both at the center and at large radii ( for systems with finite total mass ) .      for a ( regular ) function @xmath43 we begin by considering its second - order taylor expansion near the center , i.e. @xmath70 in the expansion above we limit to second order , but the present analysis can be carried out ( with increasing algebraically complexity ) to any desired order truncated at the @xmath71 order ( inclusive ) , and performing the expansions with mathematica . ] . before embarking on the following discussion , it is important to recall that the function @xmath51 allows for a linear gauge i.e. , two functions differing for @xmath72 , with @xmath73 and @xmath74 constants , lead to the same function @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ phisep ] ) , as can be easily verified by direct substitution . with the aid of this gauge it is possible to assign two prescribed values to @xmath51 at two arbitrary points , for example to impose that @xmath75 , so that for regular @xmath51 one can write @xmath76 . this form has been proved very useful in several investigations ( e.g. , de zeeuw 1985a , z85 , hunter & de zeeuw 1992 ; arnold , de zeeuw & hunter 1994 ; van de ven et al . 2003 ) . here",
    "we refrain from using the factorized form , and all the formulae are given in full generality : of course , more compact ( but less symmetric ) expressions in terms of the function @xmath77 can be immediately found from those reported here , by simple algebraical substitution .",
    "we focus first on the dmond regime , recalling that near the center @xmath78 , and analogous relations hold for the @xmath9 and @xmath79 coordinates ( see eq .  [ [ eq : centcor ] ] ) .",
    "we consider the behavior of the different operators at the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) , beginning with the laplacian .",
    "as is well known , the application of the laplace operator to a regular separable potential leads to a finite central value @xmath80 where @xmath81 ( z85 , eq .  [ 27 ] ) .",
    "therefore , barring the special case of null derivatives of @xmath51 at @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( or the more general case discussed later ) , according to eq .",
    "( [ eqpoisson ] ) the value of the central density is non - zero in separable newtonian systems .",
    "we now move to the term @xmath85 , noticing that it appears in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) , and so the convergence of the density near the origin may be not guaranteed in case of a vanishing gradient left unbalanced by the behavior of the term @xmath86 . indeed , the vanishing of @xmath85 at the center of a regular triaxial potential is expected from geometrical considerations , and in fact , by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiexp ] ) we find that near the origin @xmath87 where the three constants @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 depend on @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and their explicit expression is given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coecen1a])-([eq : coecen1b ] ) .",
    "note that the expression above is positive , because the expanded function is positive definite , and the higher order terms can not affect the sign for sufficiently small displacements from the origin .",
    "in particular , as the three ellipsoidal coordinates are independent , the three coefficients must be positive , and in fact they are perfect squares .",
    "more generally , a similar positivity argument holds for the leading term in the expansion of @xmath94 independently of the order , i.e. , the first _ non - zero _ term in the expansion is necessarily positive near the origin , as we will show in the following .",
    "we now focus on the last term in eq .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) . after some computation",
    ", it is found that near the origin @xmath95 where the three coefficients are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : normcen1 ] ) .",
    "finally , by combining the previous results , a simple calculation shows that in general near the origin @xmath96 a change to spherical coordinates then proves that _ the central density of dmond separable systems vanishes , linearly with the spherical radius @xmath97 . _",
    "a natural question arises , i.e. can we say something about @xmath11 in the special circumstance of @xmath98 ?",
    "it could be that the order balance between the numerator and the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ dmondell ] ) breaks down when the leading term of @xmath94 near the origin is of higher order .",
    "the obtained results are indeed quite interesting .",
    "first of all , by inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coecen1a])-([eq : coecen1b ] ) , it follows that the condition @xmath98 is equivalent to the requirement that @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are well defined functions of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and of @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "accordingly , we consider the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiexp ] ) , with the values of @xmath52 fixed by the special case just described ( and increasing the adopted order of expansion of @xmath51 to the third one ) .",
    "the leading terms of the expansions now read @xmath105 where the explicit form of the coefficients is given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coecen2a])-([eq : coecen2b ] ) .",
    "note that in this case also the laplace operator vanishes at the orgin , and a simple calculation shows that the density near the center vanishes as @xmath106 .",
    "we finally repeat the argument above , with the additional request that also @xmath107 , thus fixing the values of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coecen2a])-([eq : coecen2b ] ) . by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiexp ] ) with @xmath43 expanded up to the fourth order inclusive , we now find @xmath111 where the coefficients are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coecen3 ] ) : now the density at the center vanishes as @xmath112 . by repeating this exploration to higher and higher orders , we find that the order of vanishing of the density , as a function of radius @xmath97 , increases by 4 for each additional order of regularity imposed on @xmath24 near the origin . we also found that , from the third order upward , the first non - zero coefficients @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 of the leading terms near the origin depend only on the derivatives @xmath116 evaluated at @xmath117 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , so that high - order regularity at the center can be expressed directly as the vanishing of the corresponding derivatives of @xmath51 at the origin .",
    "therefore , the previous analysis shows that a generic dmond system associated with a regular triaxial separable potential has - at variance with newtonian gravity - a zero density at the center .",
    "this fact leads to some non - trivial consequences .",
    "the first is that this result remains true even when using the full mond equation , as can be verified with a formal expansion .",
    "a simple argument is as follows .",
    "if we use the full mond equation , and the central regions are not in dmond regime , then they are described by newtonian gravity .",
    "but the newtonian force in triaxial regular separable potentials vanishes , so _ all _ mond separable systems at the center are actually in dmond regime , with the consequent vanishing central density . of course , the vanishing of the central density in mond may well occur also for other families of non - separable potentials ( e.g. , for potentials with a sufficient degree of reflection symmetries along the coordinate axes ) .",
    "the second consequence follows from a further argument .",
    "suppose mond holds , and consider a separable system of baryonic density @xmath11 , so that from the previous result @xmath118 at the origin .",
    "we now focus on the the _ total _",
    "density @xmath119 of the so - called equivalent newtonian system associated with the baryonic density @xmath11 , i.e. , the mass distribution needed in newtonian gravity to produce the same gravity field of mond .",
    "of course , @xmath119 is obtained by application of the laplace operator to the mond potential , so that in the newtonian framework the baryonic density @xmath11 results `` immersed '' in a dark matter halo of density @xmath120 , and from eq .",
    "( 17 ) the halo density at the center will be different from zero .",
    "provided @xmath121 everywhere ( a non trivial request ) , we are lead to conclude that _ a separable mond system would appear , when interpreted in the context of newtonian gravity , fully dark matter dominated at the center _ , with an arbitrarily large ( formally infinite ) mass - to - light ratio near the origin .",
    "note that this property may be expected also in other families of mond potentials , not necessarily separable .",
    "in fact , it can be easily proved that a regular potential with reflection symmetries - @xmath122 - leads to a density with an expansion near the center identical to eq .",
    "( 21 ) , independently of separability .",
    "however , at higher orders the special form of eqs .",
    "( 22)-(23 ) is not obtained , showing that separability removes the cross - terms and leaves diagonalized quartics , sextics , and so on .",
    "we conclude by noting that the addition of a central black hole would change the central force field from dmond to newtonian , in principle opening the possibility to have systems with a non - zero central density .",
    "unfortunately , the addition of a central mass breaks down separability of triaxial potentials ( excluding exceptional axisymmetric cases , such that discussed in appendix b ) .",
    "the other place where the asymptotic analysis can be carried out in generality is at infinity .",
    "in particular , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ellipse])-([eq : ellcoo ] ) , it follows that @xmath123 for @xmath124 , with @xmath97 being the radius in spherical coordinates . in order",
    "to better illustrate the mond case , we begin by recalling the idea behind the computation in newtonian gravity . for a system of finite total mass @xmath125 , newtonian gravity dictates that @xmath126 for @xmath124 . if we ask also for separability , then it is easy to show that the required asymptotic trend is matched in eq .",
    "( [ phisep ] ) if and only if @xmath127 note that in the expression above we fixed @xmath128 : it is simple to restore this dimensional factor in the obtained density distribution after the application of the laplace operator .",
    "from now on we refer to @xmath129 as to the _ shape function _",
    ": its relevance in determining the mass profile at large radii will be discussed in detail in the dmond context .    by evaluating the laplace operator ,",
    "one recovers the well known result of newtonian gravity ( e.g. de zeeuw , franx & peletier 1986 ) that regular separable potentials in ellipsoidal coordinates , associated with finite total mass and finite flattening at large radii , lead to density distributions that share the asymptotic radial behavior ( in general modulated by angular dependence ) @xmath130 with additional properties listed in point 4 in the introduction .",
    "we now use a similar approach in mond . for a finite mass system , the leading monopole term of the mond potential follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqmug ] ) , with @xmath131 , due to the @xmath132 decline of the mond acceleration at large distances ( where the field is weak , and so the system is actually dmond ) . therefore ,",
    "if we ask for separability we are now forced to assume @xmath133 where the coefficient @xmath134 takes into account the relation @xmath123 .",
    "again , the dimensional coefficient @xmath135 is set equal to 1 : in the density profile obtained by the application of the mond operator , due to its non - linearity , the resulting coefficient is @xmath136 .    as in the newtonian case ,",
    "the detailed behavior at infinity of the shape function @xmath129 determines the radial profile of the density distribution ( note that this is not quite the same as the three - dimensional shape , which is also a function of the angular coordinates ) .",
    "in fact , also the first and second derivatives of @xmath137 are involved in the computation of @xmath11 and , as is well known , asymptotic properties of functions in general are not shared by their derivatives is @xmath138 . for a discussion of the possible issues involved in the differentiation of asymptotic relations , see e.g. bender & orszag ( 1978 ) . ] .",
    "in particular , an arbitrary choice of @xmath137 can lead to a system with negative densities or infinite total mass , in contrast with the hypothesis behind eq .",
    "( [ fma ] ) .",
    "for this reason , the convergence of the total mass must be checked for any specific choice of @xmath129 . in order to carry out a sufficiently general analysis ( encompassing a large fraction of the cases arising in practical situations ) , here we restrict to shape functions @xmath137 with a frobenius expansion for @xmath139 , i.e. we assume @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ fma ] ) imposes @xmath142 for @xmath143 , while for @xmath144 integer we are actually dealing with a regular function at infinity .",
    "we begin with the regular case @xmath145 .",
    "the computation of the dmond operator does not pose special difficulties in the regular case , and for @xmath146 one finds @xmath147 so that , after restoring the dimensional factor , we obtain for @xmath146 @xmath148 a few important points should be noted .",
    "first , only the leading coefficient @xmath149 appears , while all the higher order coefficients do not affect the leading term of the density expansion : at infinity , systems with @xmath142 are indistinguishable from systems with constant @xmath150 .",
    "second , the density distribution at large radii is not spherically symmetric , a consequence of the exact cancellation of the leading terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefinf ] ) when combined in eq .",

    ", other choices of @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) are possible and worth of investigation . for example , zp88 ( eq .  [ 2.13 ] ) show that the newtonian potential of the density distribution @xmath240 belongs to the @xmath3 , and that the gradient of the potential can be written in terms of carlson s ( 1979 ) symmetrized version of incomplete elliptic integrals .",
    "these functions are a closed family under differentiation , and therefore the dmond density distribution associated with this family can be written explicitely by using functions no more complicated than elliptic integrals . here",
    ", we do not study these models .",
    "in this paper we studied the properties of density distributions obtained from mond potentials separable in ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "the investigation , besides the astrophysical context , is also interesting because the mond operator , in the weak field limit ( the so - called dmond regime ) , reduces to the non - linear @xmath20-laplace operator @xmath21 with @xmath22 , the critical case in @xmath23 .",
    "the main results obtained can be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we proved that , as in the case of newtonian gravity , also for mond systems with separable potentials in ellipsoidal coordinates , the density profile along the @xmath4-axis ( the long axis of the ellipsoidal @xmath161-surfaces ) determines the potential and so the density everywhere .",
    "the second - order ode is however highly non - linear , and probably unsolvable in closed form , even in dmond , in the limit of small flattenings and/or at large distances from the origin .",
    "therefore , while we formally proved that the kuzmin property holds in mond , the associated kuzmin formula is not known , and the kuzmin theorem remains unproven .",
    "however , we obtained rigorous asymptotic formulae for the density near the origin and at infinity , in case of regular separable potentials .",
    "we showed that , at variance with the case of newtonian separable systems , the density at the center vanishes , and we studied the order of vanishing as a function of the order of regularity of the potential . from this result",
    "it follows that mond separable systems with regular potentials are necessarily in the dmond regime at their center , so that they would appear as centrally dark matter dominated ( formally , with an infinite value for the mass - to - ligh ratio ) when interpreted in the context of netwonian gravity .",
    "of course , this property may be shared by other sufficiently regular non - separable potentials in mond .",
    "the analysis at large radii was performed under the assumptions of finite total mass system and a separable potential sufficiently regular to allow for a frobenius expansion at infinity . in the regular case ( i.e. , when the expansion of the shape function @xmath137 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hlau ] ) reduces to a taylor series in terms of integer powers of @xmath241 ) , the density at large radii is positive , provided a certain coefficient in the expansion is greater than a negative value ( determined by the axial parameters of the ellipsoidal coordinates ) .",
    "the density shape is not spherically symmetric , and the radial decline is proportional to @xmath242 , at variance with the newtonian case of finite mass and finite flattening , when @xmath243 . in case of a genuine frobenius expansion with exponent @xmath155 , the total mass is still finite , but the density profile at large radii is instead spherically symmetric , with a milder radial decline @xmath244 , and positive provided the constant mentioned above is positive .",
    "this resembles the newtonian case of finite mass when the density profile along the simmetry axis is steeper than @xmath245 but shallower than @xmath246 .",
    "we constructed some triaxial separable mond models , everywhere positive for all the explored axial ratios .",
    "the shapes range from almost perfectly ellipsoidal systems to curious systems with density depressions or overdensities ( some of them similar to the models constructed in ciotti et al .",
    "2006 ) , depending on the specific choice for the shape function @xmath137 : these last models are unlikely to be useful for the description of real stellar systems .    \\5 .",
    "we briefly addressed the properties of the class of @xmath3 potentials introduced in zp88 : these potentials , albeit non - separable , are simpler than the separable case , and they are known to obey the kuzmin theorem in newtonian gravity .",
    "we showed that they obey the kuzmin property also in mond , and we derived the ode relating the potential to the density profile along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "this equation is considerably simpler than in the separable case , and in fact can be transformed in a abel equation of second kind .",
    "unfortunately , the general solution of this class of odes is not known , so the kuzmin theorem can not be proved . as an example of @xmath3 systems",
    ", we studied the case of the mond analogue of the binney ( 1981 ) logaritmic potential , and we showed that the density profile becomes negative along the @xmath4-axis , while the radial profile declines as @xmath247 . some variants of this potential however admits positive densities ( at large radii ) for some function @xmath137 , but still declining as @xmath247 , and so being characterized by infinite total mass .",
    "finally , we showed ( appendix b ) that power - law axisymmetric potentials separable in parabolic coordinates , associated with a central ( weak ) cusp can be constructed in mond , in analogy with the family discovered by sridhar & touma ( 1997 ) , albeit for a more restricted range of central slopes . if a central black hole is added , the central regions are still cuspy , but the cusp is newtonian .",
    "we conclude by noting a few points that are relevant for successive investigations .",
    "the first is related to the phase - space distribution function",
    ". presently our understanding of the phase - space distribution function of mond non - spherical systems still rely mostly on the numerical schwarzschild method ( wang et al .",
    "2008 , wu et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) or n - body simulations ( nipoti et al . 2007ab , 2011 ) , and",
    "the resulting systems are expected to be non - separable . here",
    "we can derive some firm conclusion on mond separable models .",
    "in fact , the vanishing central density of triaxial regular models forces the associated distribution functions to vanish for the values of the three integral of motions allowing for orbits that cross the center .",
    "now , the orbit classification for the newtonian case assumes that the third derivative of @xmath43 is negative everywhere ( e.g. , kuzmin 1973 , hunter & de zeeuw 1992 ) .",
    "this is the case for the reference model with @xmath169 , leading to a third derivative which is in fact @xmath248 so indeed negative as we choose @xmath249 .",
    "moreover , in case of a frobenius @xmath137 function , it is easy to prove that the expansion coefficients can be chosen so that negativity is assured ( leaving true the positivity of the density ) . in all these case ,",
    "the models are supported by the four major orbit families .",
    "this indicates that these mond models have the same orbit structure as newtonian separable systems . if the condition is violated , then there are other / more orbit families possible . restricting to the first cases",
    ", it makes plausible that selfconsistent models with vanishing central density might well exist by populating the tube orbits only , leaving the box orbits out , as these would be contributing positive density in the center .",
    "the machinery to construct such models with thin tubes only ( zero radial action ) is available from hunter & de zeeuw ( 1992 ) : by leaving the boxes out , this avoids having to compute the box orbit distribution function by numerically solving a large set of linear equations .",
    "the thin tube distribution functions are given in closed form , once @xmath43 is chosen and the density is known .",
    "the second point is that the obtained results would change if the @xmath9 function in eq .",
    "( 3 ) has a non - zero lower bound , i.e. @xmath250 for @xmath251 .",
    "in fact , the deepest gravity regimes observationally probed in isolated galaxies are @xmath252 ( e.g. , see zhao 2007 , famaey et al .",
    "2007 , wu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "if such a lower limit for @xmath9 exists , then the dynamics would be newtonian at very large radii and at very small radii , opening the possibility of mond stckel models with finite total mass and non - zero central density .",

    "a property common to all triaxial systems with a newtonian potential separable in ellipsoidal coordinates is a constant density core . in the axisymmetric case ,",
    "sridhar & touma ( 1997 ) were able to construct separable potentials supporting a central density cusp .",
    "the question is whether such property carries on in mond as well .",
    "we show that this is in fact the case .",
    "we start from the separable potential @xmath323,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parabolic coordinates @xmath324 and @xmath325 are related to the standard spherical coordinates by the identities @xmath326 sridhar & touma ( 1997 ) show that the density distribution associated with the potential above , via the laplace operator , is @xmath327 and discuss its properties as a function of @xmath217 . in particular , for @xmath328 the density is cusped at the origin and positive everywhere , and so they conclude that cuspy systems ( of infinite mass ) with separable potential exist , at least in the axisymmetric case . in the critical case ,",
    "@xmath329 , the density is cuspy , but it vanishes on the @xmath4-axis , being @xmath330 .",
    "we do not embark on the interesting but long discussion of the density related to the potential ( b1 ) in mond , but we note the following results .",
    "first , it is easy to show that the force depends on radius as @xmath331 , and does not vanish along any direction ( as the radial component of @xmath332 never vanishes ) .",
    "it follows that for @xmath333 the mond system will be similar - near the origin - to the newtonian case , when however the density is unphysical ( sridhar & touma 1997 ) . for @xmath328",
    "the system is in the dmond regime near the origin ( and newtonian at infinity ) , while in the critical @xmath329 case the force is independent of @xmath97 , and so the system can be constructed in the dmond regime everywhere .",
    "an application of the @xmath334-laplace operator to the family of power - law potential with @xmath335 easily shows that the density near the center ( or everywhere , in the @xmath329 case ) , can be written as @xmath336 where the explicit function @xmath337 is easily calculated but is not reported here .",
    "remarkably , in the range @xmath335 the function @xmath337 is nowhere negative . from eq .",
    "( b4 ) it follows that the density vanishes at the center for @xmath338 , is independent of @xmath97 for @xmath339 ( but with different values along different directions ) , and it is cusped for @xmath340 .",
    "moreover , @xmath341 , as in the newtonian case . therefore , separable potentials with a central ( weak ) cusp can be constructed also in mond , but only in the restricted range @xmath342 .",
    "however , the resulting densities , albeit positive , are still characterized by an infinite total mass , and their shapes are quite unnatural , as can be seen from fig .",
    "a1 , where some examples are presented .",
    "sridhar & touma ( 1997 ) also showed that a black hole can be added at the center of these models , leaving separability unaffected .",
    "this remains true in mond , as the gravitational field of the black hole switches the field near the center from dmond to newtonian , so that the system will be cuspy also for @xmath343 : however , this is not a `` genuine '' mond cusp .",
    "we finally note that the superposition of potentials of the family ( b1 ) with different values of @xmath217 is still a separable potential .",
    "of course , the dmond operator is non - linear , so that the associated densities are not the sum of the separate components .",
    "however , we performed some numerical experiments , and we found that the resulting densities ( for @xmath335 ) are still positive",
    ". this could open the way to the construction of new families of axisymmetric mond systems with separable potentials and more general density distributions than pure power - laws ."
