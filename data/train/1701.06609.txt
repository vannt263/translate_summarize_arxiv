    "the aim of this paper is to prove the existence result for an optimal control problem ( ocp ) governed by the system of a homogeneous dirichlet nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem , whose principle part is an anisotropic @xmath0-laplace - like operator , and a nonlinear equation of hammerstein type , and to provide sensitivity analysis for the specific case of considered optimization problem with respect to a two - parameter regularization . as controls we consider the symmetric matrix of anisotropy in the main part of the elliptic equation .",
    "we assume that admissible controls are measurable and uniformly bounded matrices of @xmath2 .",
    "systems with distributed parameters and optimal control problems for systems described by pde , nonlinear integral and ordinary differential equations have been widely studied by many authors ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , systems which contain equations of different types and optimization problems associated with them are still less well understood . in general case including as well control and state constraints , such problems are rather complex and have no simple constructive solutions .",
    "the system , considered in the present paper , contains two equations : a nonlinear elliptic equation with the so - called anisotropic @xmath0-laplace operator with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions and a nonlinear equation of hammerstein type , which nonlinearly depends on the solution of the first object .",
    "the optimal control problem we study here is to minimize the discrepancy between a given distribution @xmath3 and a solution of hammerstein equation @xmath4 , choosing an appropriate matrix of coefficients @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 subject to constrains @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive linear operator , @xmath9 is a nonlinear operator , @xmath10 is a given distribution , and a class of admissible controls @xmath11 is a nonempty compact subset of @xmath12 .",
    "the interest to equations whose principle part is an anisotropic @xmath0-laplace - like operator arises from various applied contexts related to composite materials such as nonlinear dielectric composites , whose nonlinear behavior is modeled by the so - called power - low ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is sufficient to say that anisotropic @xmath0-laplacian @xmath13 has profound background both in the theory of anisotropic and nonhomogeneous media and in finsler or minkowski geometry @xcite . as a rule",
    ", the effect of anisotropy appears naturally in a wide class of geometry   finsler geometry .",
    "a typical and important example of finsler geometry is minkowski geometry . in this case ,",
    "anisotropic laplacian is closely related to a convex hypersurface in @xmath14 , which is called the wulff shape @xcite .",
    "since the topology of the wulff shape essentially depends on the matrix of anisotropy @xmath15 , it is reasonable to take such matrix as a control .",
    "from mathematical point of view , the interest of anisotropic @xmath0-laplacian lies on its nonlinearity and an effect of degeneracy , which turns out to be the major difference from the standard laplacian on @xmath14 .    in practice ,",
    "the equations of hammerstein type appear as integral or integro - differential equations .",
    "the class of integral equations is very important for theory and applications , since there are less restrictions on smoothness of the desired solutions involved in comparison to those for the solutions of differential equations .",
    "it should be also mentioned here , that well posedness or uniqueness of the solutions is not typical for equations of hammerstein type or optimization problems associated with such objects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , this property requires rather strong assumptions on operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which is rather restrictive in view of numerous applications ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the physical motivation of optimal control problems which are similar to those investigated in the present paper is widely discussed in @xcite .",
    "using the direct method of the calculus of variations , we show in section 4 that the optimal control problem  has a nonempty set of solutions provided the admissible controls @xmath15 are uniformly bounded in @xmath18-norm , in spite of the fact that the corresponding quasilinear differential operator @xmath19 , in principle , has degeneracies as @xmath20 tends to zero @xcite .",
    "moreover , when the term @xmath21 is regarded as the coefficient of the laplace operator , we have the case of unbounded coefficients ( see @xcite ) . in order to avoid degeneracy with respect to the control @xmath15",
    ", we assume that matrix @xmath15 has a uniformly bounded spectrum away from zero . as for the optimal control problems in coefficients for degenerate elliptic equations and variational inequalities",
    ", we can refer to @xcite .",
    "a number of regularizations have been suggested in the literature .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion for what has come to be known as @xmath22-laplace problem , such as @xmath23 .",
    "while the @xmath22-laplacian regularizes the degeneracy as the gradients tend to zero , the term @xmath24 , viewed again as a coefficient , may grow large @xcite . therefore ,",
    "following ideas of @xcite , for the specific case of considered optimization problem we introduce yet another regularization that leads to a sequence of monotone and bounded approximation @xmath25 of @xmath26 . as a result , for fixed parameter @xmath27 and control @xmath15 ,",
    "we arrive at a two - parameter variational problem governed by operator @xmath28 and a two - parameter hammerstein equation with non - linear kernel @xmath29",
    ". finally , we deal with a two - parameter family of optimal control problems in the coefficients for a system of elliptic boundary value problem and equation of hammerstein type .",
    "we consequently provide the well - posedness analysis for the perturbed optimal control problems in sections 5 . in section 6 ,",
    "we show that the solutions of two - parametric family of perturbed optimal control problems can be considered as appropriate approximations to optimal pairs for the original problem similar to . to the end , we note that the approximation and regularization are not only considered to be useful for the mathematical analysis , but also for the purpose of numerical simulations .",
