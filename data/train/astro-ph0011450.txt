    "which is more important : do galaxies form , or are they assembled ?",
    "more explicitely , does star formation occur primarily in the eventual gravitational potential , albeit in localised regions within that potential , or does it occur in regions with much smaller potential wells , which are later assembled in the current whole ?    the star formation history of a galaxy , explicitely here our milky way galaxy , where the most detailed information is attainable , is the convolution of two functions .",
    "one function describes the rate of formation of the stars which are today in the galaxy .",
    "the second describes the assembly of those stars into the present galactic potential well .",
    "there is direct evidence that this assembly continues today , with both stars and gas being assembled into , or at least rearranged in , the galactic potential ( eg , the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal , ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 , 1995 ; the magellanic stream , putman etal 1998 ) .",
    "hst imaging suggests that the rate of accretion / merging was significantly higher in the past , so that accretion has always been significant .",
    "however , hst and other data also show that the star formation rate was higher in the past .",
    "a topical question is then the relative importance of these two processes , the normalisation of the merger and star formation functions , and the order in which they occur : does star formation mostly happen during mergers , or after two potential wells have merged ?",
    "some fairly direct constraints on the relative importance of star formation in a galaxy - scale potential can be deduced from the galaxian luminosity metallicity relation , shown in figure  1 for the local group . for local group galaxies direct metallicities",
    "can be determined , obviating possibly model - dependent interpretation of line indices for unresolved populations .",
    "nonetheless , this relation is consistent with the more general mass - metallicity relation for galaxies , suggesting this relation is universally valid , and applicable over the full mass range of galaxies .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation shown in fig  1 indicates that when the typical star in a galaxy is formed , at whatever redshift , it knows the depth of the gravitational potential in which it will be orbiting at redshift zero .",
    "this knowledge indicates that one can not form a large galaxy by assembling smaller stellar systems : any such resultant object would be of high luminosity and stellar mass , but of low metallicity .",
    "such objects are not found .",
    "the natural solution is to form most stars , and most metals , either during mergers , or later after assembly of gas .",
    "star formation during mergers of comparable mass gassy systems , while a very visible process which is clearly important still today , and a natural way to build bulges , is a natural way to build a disk galaxy only if star formation is very inefficient _ during _ the merger .",
    "it is also far from a natural way to build a very low - mass galaxy .",
    "one might be tempted to conclude that low mass galaxies and galaxy disks formed their stars not only _ in situ _ , but at a lower rate than was relevant to bulge formation .",
    "we now consider local constraints on this speculation .",
    "the rate at which stars formed , on average in tolerably luminous systems , has been recently quantified in the madau plot . in linear time , rather than redshift space , this shows a roughly constant rate of star formation from very early times ( @xmath0gyr afer time zero ) continuing for 4@xmath15gyr , then an apparently rapid decline ( no doubt exaggerated by the non - linear time - redshift relation ) by a factor of about 4@xmath15 to a new roughly constant rate , continung for a further 5@xmath16 gyr until today .",
    "thus , some two - thirds of stars were formed before redshift about unity .",
    "does the local group follow this trend ? if it does , then both the whole of their bulges , and the inner disks of the galaxy and m31 must have been in place , and stellar , before redshift unity .",
    "we discuss this further below , but note here that the extant , albeit indirect evidence , suggests consistency with the madau plot .",
    "the most directly consistent interpretation is that the bulge and early disk ( now the thick disk ) were formed in the first @xmath2gyr , at redshifts significantly greater than unity .",
    "a natural calibration of rapid rates of star formation is available from the dependence of the creation sites for some chemical elements on the main - sequence mass , and hence life - time , of the pre - supernova star .",
    "the most important elements in this regards are the @xmath3elements , especially oxygen , calcium , silicon and magnesium .",
    "these @xmath3elements are created and expelled during the type  ii supernovae of stars with initial masses in excess of about 10m@xmath4 , and so become available to enrich newly forming stars on times of @xmath5yr after the initiation of significant star formation .",
    "iron - peak elements are primarily created and expelled in the type  i supernova of lower mass stars , with characteristic times of @xmath6 years .",
    "thus , a high relative abundance of the @xmath3elements , compared to the iron - peak elements , indicates that the corresponding star formed within @xmath7years of the onset of significant star formation .",
    "correspondingly , if most stars in a ` population ' are determined to have relatively high values of the @xmath3elements then one may deduce that those stars all formed within one gyr of the onset of significant star formation .",
    "this situation , together with some recent observational data , is summarised in figure  2 .",
    "the left hand panel provides results from a recent study of 90 disk f - and g - dwarfs ( chen , nissen , zhao , zhang & benoni 2000 ) .",
    "they , consistently with all other studies ( eg fuhrmann 1998 ) , show the systematic overabundance of the @xmath3elements at metallicities below about @xmath8dex .",
    "the right hand panel provides the complementary models , and other data on more metal poor stars .",
    "this figure , taken from gilmore & wyse ( 1998 ) , shows the location of the metal - poor field halo stars as the hatched region , similar data from the literature to that in the left panel on thick disk stars , and a set of simple models .",
    "the crucial conclusion , immediately apparent from the data , is that the thick disk stars with metallicity between @xmath11dex and @xmath10.5dex have the same @xmath3element overabundance as does the metal - poor halo , with rather few exceptions .",
    "that is , both the field halo and the thick disk formed within @xmath92gyr of the onset of star formation in their respective locations .",
    "we emphasise that this does not imply any relationship between the halo and thick disk populations : it simply means that both formed rapidly , once they started to form .",
    "absolute age dating the populations is a separate problem , which we consider below .",
    "we note in passing that the normalisation of the @xmath3element enhancement depends on the slope of the stellar imf above the snii mass limit , about 10m@xmath4 .",
    "the similarity between this normalisation for the stars with metallicty near @xmath10.5dex and those near @xmath12.5dex is strong evidence for an invariant high - mass imf slope across this metallicity range .",
    "observational data appropriate for analyses of this type have rapidly increased in quality and quantity in the recent past , with very many studies now available .",
    "unfortunately as yet , inadequate data is available to extend this analysis to the galactic bulge : published abundance data for bulge stars are inconsistent with stellar production ratios derived from supernova observation and models , and so do not allow a self - consistent analysis .",
    "the availability of vlt+uves is expected to remedy this lack in the near future , and is an exciting prospect , allowing robust determination of the formation rate of a galactic bulge for the first time .",
    "the most robust absolute age determinations of course involve isochrones , but are feasible only when reliable distances and accurate photometry for individual stars are available .",
    "this applies reasonably well to special cases , such as globular and open clusters , and satellite galaxies , and the solar neighbourhood .",
    "age limits may also be derived without distances when a population has an approximately known abundance range , and is predominantly old .",
    "the star formation histories of the existing / surviving low surface brightness dwarf companions to the milky way are varied , with all star formation histories being apparent ( eg mateo 1998 ) .",
    "recent advances in variational calculus inversion methods have provided objective star formation histories of the satellite dsph galaxies ( hernandez , valls - gabaud & gilmore 2000a , and refs therein ) , showing that the star formation history , averaged over the sample , is crudely constant with time .",
    "the absolute rate is additionally determined with this method , and is extremely low : unsurprisingly , given the shallow depth of the corresponding potential wells .",
    "hst studies of the outer galactic bulge , while remaining fraught with complexity , are consistently showing that at least the bulge more than a few cobe scale lengths from its center is old ( ortolani etal 1995 ; feltzing & gilmore 2000 ) . the detailed recent work has confirmed an assumption in earlier analyses , that , at least statistically , the very many young stars seen in the line of sight towards the bulge are distributed spatially like the inner disk , rather than like the bulge .",
    "the central kpc of the plane of course is one of the highest star formation rate parts of the galaxy , and one can but wonder where the middle - aged descendents of such stars which formed in the past are to be found today .",
    "the current star formation rate in the central galaxy is sufficient to build the bulge over a hubble time , yet where are the intermediate age stars ?",
    "this highlights our near complete ignorance of the age distribution in the inner disk .",
    "recent iso survey data , and its spectroscopic follow - up , is identifying a substantial population of intermediate age agb stars in the inner galaxy , confirming continuing star formation over time in the inner disk ( omont et al 1999 ; van loon , gilmore , etal , in preparation ) .",
    "any plausible age - velocity dispersion relation should have scattered these stars into what is classically called ` the bulge ' , given the similarity of scale thicknesses of the inner disk and the cobe bulge . yet",
    "they remain to be identified .",
    "perhaps the most metal - rich gk stars , for which ages are not yet available , are in fact substantially younger than the more metal - poor stars .",
    "impressive recent studies have shown the majority of globular clusters in the halo are old , with a remarkably small age spread ( e.g. rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ) , while there is a small subset , particularly among the more metal - rich clusters , with inferred ages of several gyr younger than the dominant old population .",
    "age limits are available for stars in the field halo , for stars whose orbits probe most of available phase space .",
    "figure  3 , for a kinematically - selected , local sample , which through the orbits of the stars , probes a significant part of the stellar halo , shows that the vast majority of field halo stars are old , but there is a small fraction , as for the globular clusters biased to the more metal - rich stars , that are candidates for being several gyr younger .",
    "normalizing through the local halo metallicity distribution , and interpreting generously all stars blueward of the old turnoffs as being truely younger , implies that at most only around 10% of the stellar halo could be ` intermediate - age ' ( unavane , wyse & gilmore 1996 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the fraction of anomalously blue halo stars found through very different selection criteria by preston , beers & schectman ( 1994 ) .",
    "however , preston & sneden ( 2000 ) have analysed the chemical compositions and possible radial velocity variations of 62 of the preston et al .  ( 1994 ) ` blue metal - poor ' stars , for which an intermediate - age had been ascribed .",
    "they find that a very large fraction of these stars are in binaries , indeed with binary parameters suggestive of mass transfer as the explanation for their colours , rather than relative youth .",
    "the possible intermediate - age fraction of the halo is then reduced by at least a factor of two below the earlier 10% estimate ( preston & sneden 2000 ) .",
    "the star formation history of the galactic disk is of interest not only _ per se _ , but also because it provides the most direct test of galaxy formation / merger models .",
    "current understanding of the disk considers two recognizable phases : an early disk , later dynamically heated , probably by the last significant galactic merger , creating what we now call the thick disk ; and a later / continuing thin disk , forming undisturbed at a low rate .    the chemical element ratio evidence that the whole of the thick disk formed within 1@xmath12gyr of the onset of its star formation is reviewed above .",
    "absolute age dating of the thick disk remains somewhat problematic : it is difficult to isolate an unambiguous sample of thick disk stars . in",
    "so far as this has been attempted , however , the analysis suggests no detectable age interval between formation of the halo and bulge , and formation of the thick disk ( eg binney , dehnen & bertelli 2000 ; mendez & ruiz 2000 ) . even interpreting this ` no age interval ' conservatively still implies that the milky way had a disk , with scale length of about 3kpc , and already having as stars some ten percent of today s disk luminosity , at redshifts of 2 or thereabouts . a challenge for some models .",
    "the more recent evolution of the disk , and a methodology which will eventually quantify the whole situation , when adequate data are available , is summarised in figure  4 .",
    "this figure , from hernandez , valls - gabaud & gilmore ( 2000b ) , shows the solar neighbourhood star formation history , derived from hipparcos data , using a non - parametric inversion method .",
    "while the time baseline here is severely restricted by the hipparcos sample , data of higher quality and allowing extension of such analyses to the galactic inner bulge will be available from gaia ( gilmore et al 2000 ) .",
    "one may quantify the general discussions above , combining limits on the chemical uniformity of a stellar population , the element ratio information and its scatter , and the luminosity / number of stars involved , to derive limits on actual star formation rates .",
    "the first limit comes from the observed small scatter in the ratio of the @xmath3elements to the iron - peak elements at a specific metallicity .",
    "this small scatter requires one of two orthogonal conditions to be met : either the duration of star formation was so short that no self - enrichment took place , a situation naturally consistent with no range in any elemental abundances ( globular cluster formation ? ) , or the duration of star formation was sufficiently long , and the rate sufficiently low , that efficient mixing of snae ejecta across the whole star - forming volume was possible . to minimise variations due to shot - noise in the number of snae ` enrichment events ' , the involved volume can not have been too small .    to quantify the duration and rate @xmath10 of star formation in the stellar populations of the galactic bulge and halo we need to specify four observational quantities : the halo ( or bulge ) stellar mass ( @xmath11 ) , the lifetime and mass of the stellar supernova progenitors ( available from isochrones : @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , the mass fraction of the halo which has been sampled by extant spectroscopic element ratio data ( @xmath14 ) , and the fraction @xmath15 of halo stars which deviate significantly from the predominant halo element ratio distribution ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the mixing efficiency parameter can be quantified from simple monte carlo simulations of the number of supernovae ejecta , with each sn event drawn randomly from the available stellar imf mass range , @xmath19 , and assigning to each the appropriate ( theoretical ) mass - dependent yield .",
    "the number of snae , and the mass of gas into which the ejecta are mixed , which are required to keep an observed scatter below that seen in stars can then be determined .",
    "the minimum requirement is for @xmath20 30 snae and a gas mass @xmath21 in a well - mixed region .",
    "these parameters may be converted into a corresponding length scale , and a consequent limit on the mixing efficiency , adopting a length scale relevant to observations at high redshift . for the present , we adopt the relatively high densities of damped ly@xmath22 systems , implying length scales of tens of pc for n@xmath23 , and corresponding sound speeds of v@xmath24km / s , for the smallest possible well - mixed regions .    assuming all halo star formation takes place in a set of regions of this small size provides a conservative limit on the mixing efficiency parameter @xmath17 of order ten .",
    "more uniformly distributed star formation would require even lower star formation rates to allow adequate mixing of the snae ejecta .",
    ".a summary of star formation rates , and durations of star formation , in some galactic stellar populations .",
    "these values are derived from combination of chemical element scatter and masses . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     in neither case is there evidence for a very high star formation rate ` scuba - source ' history .",
    "fundamentally , there are just too few stars in the halo , or the bulge , for a high star formation rate to have been involved in their formation , given the lower limit on the duration of star formation required by the lack of element ratio scatter .      for those globular clusters where no evidence of self - enrichment is seen in the ( delta - function ) distribution of iron - peak elements , a lower limit on star formation can be deduced , simply by requiring that all observed stars are formed before the first snae occur .",
    "this limit is however very low , of order @xmath28 . in cases such as @xmath29cen , where an abundance spread is seen , a corresponding upper limit is available , in that the cluster stars should not have all formed before the self - enrichment could occur"
