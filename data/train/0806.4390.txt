    "massive star cluster formation takes place during major star bursts .",
    "the age substructure of a particular star cluster system therefore provides a historical record of significant star formation events in its host galaxy .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are a class of massive star clusters with a mean mass of a few @xmath0 and are notable for their compactness .",
    "observational evidences generally suggests the bulk of gc formation took place within roughly 2 gigayears of the big bang ( see references in brodie & strader 2006 ) .",
    "systems of gcs are known to host a blue and red gc subpopulations in terms of their photometric colour ( e.g. peng et al .",
    "2006 ; strader et al .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for a bimodal metallicity distribution , hence most gc systems contain both a metal - poor ( or blue ) and metal - rich ( red ) gc subpopulation .",
    "given the close proximity of the gc formation epoch to the time when the universe was free of metals , the existence of two gc metallicity subpopulations likely implies that two distinct phases of gc formation took place at different epochs . obtaining absolute age dates of the two star formation events ( and subsequent ones ) can help constrain the detailed formation and assembly history of a galaxy .",
    "this has encouraged efforts to age - date gcs and consequently a number of techniques have been employed to overcome the age - metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "analysis of absorption line indices from spectroscopy is one such technique and most of the few hundred or so gcs with good data are found to be as old as galactic gcs .",
    "unfortunately , the lengthy telescope time required for such analysis is costly , hence the number of gcs studied in this manner remains remarkably low .",
    "a notable exception is the recent work of @xcite , who have obtained spectroscopic ages and metallicities for @xmath1 gcs in the massive elliptical galaxy , ngc  5128 .",
    "existing spectroscopic studies are also biased towards the brightest gcs , an important caveat that should be re - emphasised given the discovery of a gc colour - magnitude trend @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the well - studied milky way gc system exhibits no such trend with gc luminosity .",
    "gc colour data can also help overcome the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "this involves a comparison between observational colour - colour data for individual gcs and theoretical stellar population model predictions .",
    "optical to infrared ( ir ) colours are essential for this work , as the degeneracy among optical colours is severe for ages @xmath2gyr ( e.g. lee et al .",
    "from analysis of optical and near - ir photometry , gc system age substructure has been reported in ngc  1316 @xcite , ngc  4365 (; however c.f . ) and ngc  5846 . in most instances , a subpopulation of `` intermediate - age '' gcs ( @xmath3 gyr ) that make up a small fraction ( @xmath4 ) of the total gc system is claimed .",
    "a notable exception is the gc system of ngc  4365 , which might contain @xmath5 of these younger gcs ( puzia et al . 2002 ; though cf .",
    "larsen et al .",

    "the systems for which no age substructure was reported using near - ir photometry include : m87 , ngc  4478 ( kissler - patig , brodie & minniti 2002 ) , ngc  3115 , ngc  4594 , ngc  3585 and ngc  4472 ( hempel et al .",
    "however , the data samples for each of these systems are typically small : on order of a few tens of gcs per system .",
    "optical to ir colour data is also well - suited for characterising gc metallicity distributions , hence can help constrain the chemical properties of galaxies at early epochs .",
    "such colours span very large dynamical ranges and allow more precise metallicity measurements .",

    "r while 0.1 dex is @xmath7 mag in b ",
    "k ( according to the preliminary models of charlot & bruzual 2008 priv . comm . ) .",
    "the ir is also insensitive to hot horizontal branch stars .",
    "this is a important point considering the cautionary work of yoon , yi & lee ( 2006 ) who suggested gc colour bimodality might entirely result from a rapid transition between blue and red horizontal branches at intermediate gc metallicities .",

    "in contrast , irac channels one ( [ 3.6 ] ) and two ( [ 4.5 ] ) show many sources over the entire field of view .",

    "the [ 3.6 ] images were dithered by the sings group to increase the image resolution and astrometric precision .",

    "the software tools used to extract irac photometry are packaged in the multi - purpose image analysis software application ( mopex ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the specific method employed was that recommended in the mopex documentation .",
    "object detection and photometry was carried out on the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] images after the diffuse galaxy light was removed by the subtraction of a median - filter image .",
    "a local object detection threshold of @xmath24 was used . to address object crowding ,",
    "the apparent magnitude of each object was determined by fitting a point spread function ( psf ) to its profile .",
    "an empirical psf for each irac dataset was constructed with mopex using bright , isolated objects .",
    "the psf full - width at half - maximums are 1.7 ( 2.0 ) and 2.1 ( 1.6 ) pixels for the ngc  5128 and ngc  4594 [ 3.6 ] images , respectively .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ figcena ] , the psf fitting residuals are minimal , suggesting the photometric method is robust .",
    "fluxes from individual objects were calibrated to the vega magnitude system using the photometric zeropoints from @xcite .",
    "apparent magnitudes were not corrected for galactic extinction because dust has a negligible impact in this wavelength regime ( a@xmath25 a@xmath26 } } \\la 0.02 $ ] mag ) .    while the majority of the objects detected in the [ 3.6 ] -band images are also found in the [ 4.5 ] images ,",
    "the magnitude difference between the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] bands are essentially negligible for old gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for such stellar populations , if the [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] photometric data had shown comparable measurement uncertainties , the two bands might be combined to increase the accuracy of their mid - ir photometric measure . in the present case ,",
    "the formal [ 4.5]-band photometric uncertainties are twice those of the [ 3.6 ] -band , thus the subsequent analysis only makes use of the [ 3.6 ] -band data .    to test the robustness of the spitzer photometry extraction method , images containing artificial objects of known magnitudes were produced and their magnitudes",
    "were extracted using the same method described above . in detail , for each 0.2 mag .",
    "interval over the observed magnitude range of the gcs , an artificial field from the original images field was populated with 4000 artifical objects .",
    "the same detection and psf - fitting method were applied to these artifical fields and the results are summarised in figure  [ figcomptest ] . from the residuals between the input and measured magnitudes , it is apparent the formal photometric errors estimated by _",
    "mopex _ were slightly underestimated .",
    "the formal photometric errors are therefore taken as the @xmath27 level of the test residuals .      ngc  4594 gc optical photometry was extracted from a hst acs image mosaic ( b , v , & r bands ) by @xcite .",
    "the acs imaging covers a @xmath28 ( @xmath29 kpc@xmath30 kpc ) region , centred on ngc  4594 .",
    "optical photometry for the ngc  5128 gcs is from the woodley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) catalogue , which is largely drawn from the work of peng et al .",
    "a subset of the ngc  5128 gcs have spectroscopic ages and metallicities measured by @xcite . in both optical datasets , corrections for galactic extinction are from the dirbe dust maps @xcite .",
    "ngc  4594 gc photometry was derived in @xcite using a standard aperture photometry technique .",
    "they applied a single aperture correction to account for light falling beyond the extraction aperture ( 5 acs pixels or @xmath31 ) and within a radius of 10 acs pixels ( @xmath32 ) . a constant aperture correction for the entire dataset may not accurately represent the gc photometry .",
    "more specifically , a trend is observed where the more extended objects show @xmath33 mag .",
    "more flux than the most compact gc in the 5 to 10 pixel annulus .",
    "the effect is roughly the same in each of the b , v and r bands thus the effect was negligible in the spitler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) work because it will cancel when optical colours are produced .",
    "the cancelling occurs because the pixel scales of the acs images are identical and filter - dependent psf variations are small .",
    "however , when acs and spitzer photometry are combined , the aperture corrections applied must be performed properly in an absolute sense to avoid introducing scatter in the acs - spitzer colours .",
    "such scatter results from the different pixel scales of the instruments : gcs are resolved in the acs images , but not in the irac images . to mitigate this effect , the ngc  4594 optical photometry was re - derived with an extraction aperture of 10 pixels and adopted throughout the following .",
    "cross - matching between the optical gc catalogues and spitzer objects was carried out using a matching threshold of @xmath34 in both the ngc  4594 and the ngc  5128 images . in the ngc  4594 dataset , to decrease the chances of a nearby ( projected ) object effecting spitzer flux measurements , all gc candidates with at least one nearby ( @xmath35 ) object in the acs images of a comparable magnitude ( within + 2.5 b - band magnitudes of the gc candidate ) were culled from further analysis .",
    "a total of 19 ngc  4594 gc candidates were not considered for this reason .",

    "yoon et al . ( 2006 ; see also richtler 2006 ) recently demonstrated that the interpretation of a bimodal optical colour distribution as evidence for two subpopulations of gcs depends critically on the relationship employed to translate colour into metallicity .",
    "according to their ssp models ( y06 ) , the transition from a blue to red horizontal branch ( hb ) at intermediate metallicities causes a change in slope of this relation .",
    "this change in slope means that an observed bimodal colour distribution may in reality be resultant from a single , unimodal metallicity distribution .    to determine how much of an effect hb stars have on the observed gc colour bimodality , colours derived from wavebands that are insensitive to hb stars ( e.g. ir ) can be compared to those colours that are ( e.g. b - band ) .",
    "indeed , simulations by cantiello & blakeslee ( 2007 ) of the spot models show that certain optical / near - ir colours ( e.g. v  h and v  k ) are preferred for circumventing any biases caused by any non - linear structure in the colour - metallicity relationship .",

    "for example , the region where metal - rich gcs fall in figure  [ figurrch1 ] matches with the @xmath96 gyr predictions of m05 .",
