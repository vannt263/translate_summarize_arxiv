    "the strong coupling @xmath0  is one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "several possibilities exist to determine this parameter , one method being presented in this paper . in @xmath3-annihilation with quarks in the final state hard gluons can be emitted from the quark with the emission probability being proportional to the strong coupling @xmath0 .",
    "events with a hard gluon are identified by observing at least three particle jets in the detector .",
    "the theory of strong interaction , quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , allows to predict the rate of three - jet events as a function of a single parameter , the strong coupling @xmath0 .",
    "recent theoretical improvements  @xcite allow to calculate the three - jet rate at next - to - next - to - leading - oder ( nnlo ) and a first measurement with data collected by the aleph detector at 91  gev using the three - jet rate at a single resolution parameter was published  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the measurement of @xmath0  using data collected with the jade detector between the years 1979 and 1986 . for the first time",
    "nnlo predictions are matched with next - to - leading logarithmic approximations ( nlla ) , including subleading soft logarithms , to measure @xmath0  with the three - jet rate .",
    "the complete description of the analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in order to count the number of jets in the final state the reconstructed particle tracks and neutral clusters have to be clustered to jets .",
    "several clustering schemes are available and we use the durham clustering algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the number of jets depends on the resolution parameter @xmath1 , a measure indicating the separation between the second and the third reconstructed jet .",
    "the fixed order prediction of the three - jet rate determined with the durham clustering scheme is matched to nlla predictions using the @xmath4-matching scheme .",
    "parts of the subleading soft logarithms , which are not included in the nlla calculations , can be systematically controlled and included by adding a renormalisation scheme dependent @xmath5-term  @xcite .",
    "including the @xmath5-term significantly improves the description of the data .",
    "qcd predictions of the three - jet rate , without the expected contribution from hadronisation effects , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fignnlo ] .",
    "the jade detector collected data in @xmath3-annihilation at the petra accelerator at desy between 1979 and 1986 .",
    "we use data taken at 14  gev , 22  gev , 34.6  gev , 35  gev , 38.3  gev and 43.8  gev , adding up to a total integrated luminosity of about 195 @xmath6 .",
    "the number of selected hadronic events ranges between about 1000 events at 14  gev and 20000 events at 35  gev .",
    "the selection of hadronic events is based on the event multiplicity , momentum imbalance and on the total visible energy .",
    "the events are corrected for acceptance effects and the qcd predictions for the hadronisation of partons to hadrons . for these correction procedures monte carlo ( mc ) samples generated with pythia ,",
    "herwig  or ariadne  are used , with the generators being tuned to events taken with the opal detector at lep at a centre - of - mass energy of 91  gev . the expected contribution from @xmath7-events , as predicted by simulation , is subtracted from the observed three - jet rate .",
    "the excellent description of the three - jet event rate by simulation is visualised in fig .",
    "[ figmcdata ] .",
    "the measured and corrected three - jet rate together with the matched nnlo+nlla+k qcd predictions is used to determine the strong coupling @xmath0 .",
    "a @xmath8-value , obtained from the difference between the measured three - jet rate and the qcd predictions , is calculated and minimised .",
    "the qcd predictions are applied with the renormalisation scale factor set to the natural choice @xmath9=1 .",
    "events simulated with the pythia  event generator are used to correct the predicted three - jet rate for hadronisation effects .",
    "the fit range is determined by requiring the correction from hadronisation and detector effects to be small .",
    "in addition the leading log contribution in the qcd prediction is required to be well below unity .",
    "the correlations between the different @xmath1  bins are determined using mc events .",
    "the result obtained at a centre - of - mass energy of 35  gev from the fit to the three - jet rate is shown together with the three - jet rate distribution in fig .",
    "[ figfit ] .",
    "several sources of systematic uncertainties are considered for the measurement of the strong coupling @xmath0 .",
    "the fit is repeated and the difference between the variation and the default analysis is taken as the symmetric systematic uncertainty .",
    "the different sources of systematic uncertainties are arranged in three categories :    * * experimental uncertainties : * the fit is repeated with a somewhat modified event selection , different reconstruction software , different correction for detector effects or a slight variation of the fit range .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are evaluated applying these variations and added in quadrature .",
    "the main contribution comes from using different detector correction procedures and using different reconstruction software . *",
    "* hadronisation uncertainties : * different mc models are applied to adjust the qcd predictions for hadronisation effects .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty comes from evaluating the hadronisation correction with the herwig  event generator instead of the pythia  event generator , as used in the default method . *",
    "* theoretical uncertainties : * in the default fit the renormalisation scale parameter @xmath9= @xmath10 is set to the natural choise @xmath9=1 . as a systematic variation @xmath9  is set to 0.5 and 2 and the larger difference to the default fit is taken as the theoretical systematic uncertainty .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0  is performed at each energy point separately and the final result is obtained by combining the results of @xmath0  at the various centre - of - mass energies . due to large hadronisation corrections the result from the fit to the data taken at 14  gev",
    "is not included in the combination .",
    "the combined value for @xmath0  evolved to the energy @xmath11  is @xmath2 , consistent with the world average value of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of @xmath0  at the various energy points is shown in fig .",
    "[ figrunalphas ] .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0  measured with the three - jet rate as a function of the centre - of - mass energy is consistent with the expectation from qcd .      besides fixing the renormalisation scale @xmath9  to the natural choice",
    "the fit is repeated with @xmath9  and @xmath0  being free in the fit .",
    "the renormalisation scale obtained by the fit is consistently below unity , but with large statistical uncertainties and being consistent with one .",
    "the large uncertainty can be understood by looking in more detail to the variation of @xmath0  with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the change in @xmath0  is rather flat , leading to small theoretical uncertainties and to large statistical uncertainties for the renormalisation scale @xmath9 .",
    "the results obtained from the various energy points are combined to a single value , leading to @xmath13 , again being consistent with the world average value .",
    "the fit is repeated with fixed order predictions only and @xmath9  being set to one or leaving @xmath9  as free parameter in the fit . for the fit with @xmath9  being set to the natural choice the @xmath14  is considerably worse than the one obtained with matched qcd predictions ( almost a factor four in the @xmath14  for the fit to the data collected at 35  gev ) .",
    "this points to missing higher order terms in the qcd prediction .",
    "in addition the fit result also shows an increased sensitivity to the fit range . using matched nnlo+nlla+k qcd predictions the dependency on the fit range is almost negligible , while for nnlo predictions the choice of the lower @xmath1  value in the fit range has a significant impact on the result .    leaving @xmath0  as well as @xmath9  free in the fit leads to a significantly improved description of the fit with @xmath14  values similar to the one obtained from the fit with matched qcd predictions .",
    "however , the value obtained for the scale @xmath9  is rather low ( around 0.2 ) and within the statistical uncertainty inconsistent with being one . the uncertainty on the fitted scale parameter @xmath9   is about one order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty on the scale parameter obtained with matched predictions .",
    "this indicates that the sensitivity of @xmath0  with respect to the renormalisation scale @xmath9  is increased compared to the fit with matched qcd predictions .",
    "we present the first measurement of @xmath0  determined with the durham three - jet rate using matched nnlo+nlla+k qcd predictions . for this measurement",
    "hadronic events from @xmath3-annihilation taken at centre - of - mass energies between 14 and 44  gev are used . the result @xmath2is consistent with the world average value .",
    "the largest uncertainty originates from modeling the transition from parton level , as predicted from the perturbative qcd calculations , to the hadron level , as observed by the experiment .",
    "the increased precision of perturbative qcd predictions , together with large hadronic @xmath3  event samples , will allow to scrutinize mc generators modeling the transition from partons to hadrons .",
    "a measurements of @xmath0   using fixed order predictions only can not describe the data satisfactorily . a fit leaving @xmath0  as well as @xmath9  free returns a good description of the data , but the fitted value of @xmath9  is inconsistent with one .    fig .",
    "[ figsummary ] summarizes the result obtained here to previous analyses using jet rates and differential jet rates .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath0  using a fit to the @xmath15   distribution returns the almost identical result for @xmath0  as measured with this analysis .",
    "the measurements obtained at higher",
    "centre - of - mass energies return smaller uncertainties , since the size of the hadronisation correction decreases with increasing centre - of - mass energy . the measurement of @xmath0  using the four - jet rate and data taken between 14 and 44  gev returns a smaller hadronisation uncertainty , leading to a decreased overall uncertainty .",
