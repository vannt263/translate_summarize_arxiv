    "gauge mediation @xcite is very attractive for the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking mechanism , since it is free from the serious flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem in the supersymmetric standard model .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that the minimal gauge mediation model is still consistent with all experimental data and cosmological constraints @xcite .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to discuss possible dark matter candidates in the gauge mediation model .",
    "a well - known candidate is the gravitino .",
    "if the gravitino mass @xmath1 is lighter than 1 kev , the gravitino can not saturate the dark matter abundance @xcite . even for 1 kev @xmath2 100 kev",
    ", the gravitino dark matter would be too warm , and the small - scale fluctuations will be erased @xcite .",
    "in addition , the reheating temperature after inflation should be @xmath3  gev for the thermally produced gravitinos to be dark matter @xcite .",
    "to test the gravitino dark matter we need first to produce susy particles in collider experiments and see their decays into the almost massless gravitino .",
    "however , even if the susy particles are produced it is very challenging to observe the decay if the gravitino is heavier than 1 kev .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the other possibility that the @xmath0 ball is the dark matter in gauge mediation , and look for the discovery potential of @xmath0-ball dark matter at icecube .",
    "there are a lot of flat directions in susy .",
    "they consist of some combinations of squarks ( and sleptons ) in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , so that they carry baryonic charge .",
    "the @xmath0 ball is a nontopological soliton , the energy minimum configuration of the flat direction for a finite baryon number @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 ball with large enough charge ( the baryon number ) is stable against decay into nucleons in gauge mediation , it is reasonable to consider the @xmath0 ball as the dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 ball would be the dark matter in the parameter region different from that for gravitino dark matter : the gravitino mass could range for kev @xmath2 gev , or even smaller , and the reheating temperature must be @xmath4  gev . moreover , it has a completely different detection procedure from other dark matter candidates .",
    "very large volume neutrino detectors such as icecube can directly detect dark matter @xmath0 balls in the ( near ) future .",
    "the sketch of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the set - up of gauge - mediated susy breaking . in sect .  3 , we review the @xmath0 ball in gauge mediation , where there are two types of @xmath0 ball .",
    "we estimate the abundance of the @xmath0 ball and show the parameter region where the @xmath0 balls could be the dark matter in sect .",
    "4 . in the same section",
    ", we look for the possibility of @xmath0-ball detection in the icecube experiment .",
    "5 is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "we adopt the so - called minimal direct gauge mediation described only by a few parameters , and free from both the susy fcnc problem and the susy cp problem @xcite . the susy is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of the susy - breaking field @xmath5 as @xmath6 the susy - breaking sector is connected to the observable sector by the messenger fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 , a pair of some representations and anti - representations of the minimal gut group @xmath9 , through the yukawa interactions as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a coupling constant , and @xmath12 is the messenger mass .",
    "then the mssm gaugino and scalar masses are estimated as @xmath13 on the other hand , the gravitino mass is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15  gev is the planck mass .",
    "the higgs boson mass at around 126  gev leads to @xcite @xmath16 since @xmath17 , it results in @xmath18",
    "a @xmath0 ball is a nontopological soliton , the energy - minimum configuration of the scalar field for finite charge @xmath0 @xcite . in mssm",
    ", this scalar field corresponds to some flat direction , which consists of some combination of squarks ( and sleptons ) , and the charge @xmath0 would be the baryon number . in gauge mediation , a @xmath0 ball with large enough charge is stable against decay into nucleons ; as will be seen later , it can be the dark matter of the universe .",
    "the potential of the flat direction is expressed as @xcite @xmath19 here the first term comes from gauge mediation effects , and @xmath20 is related to susy - breaking @xmath21-term as @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 generically denotes the gauge coupling of the standard model .",
    "thus the gravitino mass can be expressed as @xmath24 the second term of eq.([pot ] ) originates from gravity mediation effects , and the one - loop correction is included .",
    "@xmath25 is typically negative , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the renormalization scale .",
    "since the messenger scale @xmath28 has the lower limit in eq.([lambdamess ] ) , it should be @xmath29 likewise , the gravitino mass has the lower bound @xmath30 we shall call them the @xmath28-limit in the following .",
    "the flat direction has large amplitude during and after inflation , and starts its oscillation when the hubble parameter becomes as large as the curvature of the potential @xcite .",
    "once the oscillation begins , the flat direction feels spatial instabilities , which grow into @xmath0 balls very fast @xcite .",
    "actually , the field rotates in the potential due to the so - called @xmath31-terms , so the orbit of the field may be circular or oblate depending on the size of the @xmath31-terms .",
    "however , in any case , @xmath0 balls ( and anti-@xmath0 balls in the case with the oblate orbit ) form with similar sizes @xcite , so that the @xmath0-ball abundance has almost no dependence on the size of the @xmath31-terms .",
    "there are two types of @xmath0 ball : the gauge - meditation type and the new type @xcite .",
    "the former forms when the field begins the oscillation when the potential is dominated by @xmath32 , where the field amplitude at that time is smaller than @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the charge of this type of @xmath0 ball is given by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the amplitude of the field at the beginning of its oscillation , and @xmath37 for a circular orbit ( @xmath38 ) , while @xmath39 for an oblate orbit ( @xmath40 ) , where @xmath41 denotes the ellipticity of the field orbit .",
    "the features of the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball are as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mass and the size of the @xmath0 ball , respectively , @xmath45 is the rotation speed of the field inside the @xmath0 ball , and @xmath46 is the @xmath47 parameter @xcite .    on the other hand , the new type @xmath0 ball is produced if @xmath48 dominates the potential when @xmath49 .",
    "the charge of the @xmath0 ball is estimated as @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the properties of this type of @xmath0 ball are @xmath52 the charge @xmath0 is actually the @xmath53-number and related to the baryon number as @xmath54 , where the flat direction carries the charge @xmath55 .",
    "for example , @xmath56 for the @xmath57 direction .",
    "@xmath0 balls can become the dark matter of the universe if they are stable against decay into nucleons .",
    "balls with @xmath0 being the lepton number , so - called @xmath58 balls , can decay into neutrinos .",
    "large @xmath58 balls could have a lifetime longer than the present age of the universe , but the abundance becomes many orders of magnitude larger than the critical density .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 balls can not be the dark matter of the universe . ]",
    "@xmath45 can be regarded as the effective mass of the field inside the @xmath0 ball .",
    "because of kinematics , the @xmath0 ball can not decay into nucleons for @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the nucleon mass . for the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball ,",
    "the condition is rewritten as @xmath61 on the other hand , the new - type @xmath0 ball is generically stable since @xmath62 gev .",
    "in this section , we investigate how the dark matter @xmath0 ball can be realized , and seek the possibility for their direct detection .",
    "we also show the parameter region where the gravitino can be the dark matter , and see that it resides in a different part of the parameter space .",
    "there are several conditions for the @xmath0 ball to be the dark matter of the universe",
    ". the @xmath0 ball should be ( a ) stable to be the dark matter , and ( b ) have the correct dark matter abundance .",
    "since there are two types of @xmath0 ball , the amplitude at the oscillation , @xmath36 , should be in the right place of the potential , which corresponds to the condition ( c ) @xmath63 for the gauge - mediation type , and @xmath49 for the new type @xmath0 ball , so that the potential must be dominated respectively by @xmath32 or @xmath48 at the onset of the field oscillation .",
    "in addition , the @xmath28-limit of ( [ llimit1 ] ) or ( [ llimit2 ] ) should be satisfied .",
    "let us first consider the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball .",
    "the @xmath0-ball abundance is estimated as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy density of the inflaton , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and eq.([mqg ] ) are used .",
    "observationally , the amount of dark matter is @xmath69  gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the field at the beginning of the oscillation becomes @xmath70 the stability condition ( [ stableg ] ) and eq.([qg ] ) lead to @xmath71 from these two equations , we have the upper limit on the reheating temperature as @xmath72 for the @xmath0 balls to be the dark matter .",
    "the condition ( c ) can be rephrased , using eqs.([phioscdmg ] ) and ( [ phieq ] ) together with eq.([m32mf ] ) , as the lower bound on the reheating temperature : @xmath73 we show the allowed region for the @xmath0-ball dark matter in fig.1 .",
    "the red line denotes the upper limit ( [ stablelimitg ] ) , the magenta line shows the @xmath28-limit ( [ llimit1 ] ) with @xmath74 , and the blue lines represent the lower bound ( [ phieqboundg ] ) for each value of @xmath11 shown in the figure .",
    "we conservatively assume that @xmath75  mev , so that we do not show @xmath76 lower than 1  mev in the figures",
    ".     ball as the dark matter ( red hatched ) .",
    "the red line denotes the upper limit ( [ stablelimitg ] ) , the magenta line shows the @xmath28-limit ( [ llimit1 ] ) with @xmath74 , and the blue lines represent the lower bound ( [ phieqboundg ] ) for each value of @xmath11 shown .",
    "the dark matter @xmath0 ball is excluded by the baksan experiment ( dark green hatched ) @xcite and icecube ( light green hatched ) @xcite .",
    "thermally produced gravitino dark matter is shown in brown lines for each value of @xmath11 , and the dashed line corresponds to @xmath77  kev .",
    "[ fig1],width=340 ]    next we consider the new type of @xmath0 ball .",
    "again , the @xmath0 ball should be ( a ) stable to be the dark matter , and ( b ) have the correct dm abundance . in this case , since the potential must be dominated by @xmath48 at the onset of the field oscillation , we also have ( c ) @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath0-ball abundance is estimated as @xmath78 where we use @xmath79 and @xmath80 at the onset of the field oscillation .",
    "using @xmath81  gev , we need the field amplitude when the oscillation starts to be @xmath82 together with the condition ( c ) @xmath49 , the reheating temperature has an upper limit as @xmath83 we then obtain the @xmath11-dependent upper limit on @xmath76 by inserting eq.([m32mf ] ) into eq.([rhoqphieqn ] ) : @xmath84 the stability condition ( a ) is given by @xmath85 where eq.([omegaqn ] ) is used .",
    "the @xmath0 ball can be the dark matter in the rectangular region surrounded by the stability condition ( [ m32st ] ) in the red line , the lower limit on @xmath1 eq.([llimit2 ] ) in magenta lines , the condition ( c ) eq.([kdeptrh ] ) in blue lines , and @xmath86 1  mev , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "varying the value of @xmath11 , the intersection of eqs.([llimit2 ] ) and ( [ kdeptrh ] ) spans on the line @xmath87 shown in a black line in the figure .",
    "we thus hatched the triangle surrounded by eqs.([trhphieqn ] ) and ( [ m32st ] ) and @xmath86 1  mev as the allowed region .",
    "ball as the dark matter ( blue hatched ) .",
    "the red line denotes the stability condition ( [ m32st ] ) , the magenta lines show the @xmath28-limit ( [ llimit2 ] ) with @xmath74 for each @xmath11 , and the blue lines represent the upper bound ( [ kdeptrh ] ) for each value of @xmath11 .",
    "the trace of the intersection of eqs.([llimit2 ] ) and ( [ kdeptrh ] ) , which is eq.([trhphieqn ] ) , is shown in a black line .",
    "the dark matter @xmath0 ball is excluded by the baksan experiment ( dark green hatched ) @xcite and icecube ( light green hatched ) @xcite .",
    "thermally produced gravitino dark matter is shown in a brown line , and the dashed line corresponds to @xmath77  kev .",
    "[ fig2],width=340 ]      @xmath0 balls can be detected through the so - called kkst ( kusenko - kuzmin - shaposhnikov - tinyakov ) process @xcite , which is similar to the rubakov - callan effect for the magnetic monopole @xcite .",
    "when nucleons collide with a @xmath0 ball , they enter the surface layer of the @xmath0 ball , and dissociate into quarks , which are converted to squarks . during the course of the process , the @xmath0 ball releases energy of @xmath88  gev per collision by emitting soft pions .",
    "therefore , charged particles are created along the path of the @xmath0 ball through the detector .",
    "since the @xmath0 balls in our dark halo have the velocity @xmath89 , those experiments for the subrelativistic monopole search can be applied to @xmath0-ball detection .",
    "the observable is the upper limit of the @xmath0-ball flux at the certain cross section , since no @xmath0 ball has been detected so far .",
    "the flux and the cross section of the dark matter @xmath0 ball are given respectively by @xmath90 where @xmath91  gev/@xmath92 is the local dark matter density , and they are related to the charge @xmath0 though the @xmath0-ball properties eqs.([mqg ] ) @xmath93 ( [ omegaqg ] ) for the gauge - mediation type and eqs.([mqn ] ) @xmath93 ( [ omegaqn ] ) for the new type . in fig.3 , we show the theoretically expected regions for the gauge - mediation and new types of @xmath0 ball respectively by red and blue triangle areas . also shown",
    "are the upper limits of the @xmath0-ball flux from baksan @xcite and icecube @xcite ,  @xmath94sec@xmath95sr@xmath95 to larger cross sections . ]",
    "hatched in dark green and green , respectively .",
    "we see that some region for the new type of @xmath0 ball is already excluded and there is a good possibility of direct detection of the @xmath0 ball in the near future .",
    "ball for the gauge - mediation ( red ) and the new ( blue ) types .",
    "we also plot the flux limits from the baksan ( dark - green ) @xcite and icecube ( green ) @xcite experiments .",
    "[ fig3],width=340 ]    finally , we use these experimental bounds to impose some constraints on the reheating temperature by using eqs.([qg ] ) and ( [ phioscdmg ] ) for the gauge - mediation type in fig.1 , while using eqs.([qn ] ) and ( [ phioscdmn ] ) for the new type in fig.2 . in this way",
    ", we plot the regions where the dark matter @xmath0 ball is excluded by the baksan experiment ( dark green ) @xcite and icecube ( light green ) @xcite . for the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball in fig.1",
    ", the excluded regions are getting closer to the theoretically expected area .",
    "on the other hand , for the new type @xmath0 balls in fig.2 , the upper part of the allowed region is now observationally excluded , and @xmath0-ball dark matter can be realized for @xmath4  gev .      as mentioned above ,",
    "the gravitino is also a natural candidate for the dark matter in gauge mediation .",
    "we therefore estimate the parameters for which gravitinos account for the dark matter and show that the region is totally different from that where the @xmath0 ball is the dominant component of the dark matter .",
    "the abundance of gravitinos thermally produced by scatterings is given by @xcite @xmath96 for @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the gaugino mass . since @xmath81  gev and @xmath99",
    ", we have @xmath100 this is shown in a brown line in fig.2 .",
    "if the gravitino mass is less than 100 kev , the gravitino is mainly produced by the decay of the susy particle @xcite .",
    "then the upper limit on the reheating temperature becomes of the order of the mass of susy particles for kev @xmath2 100 kev , although the gravitino dark matter may be too warm . therefore , the new - type @xmath0 ball can be the dark matter for a lower reheating temperature than the gravitino dark matter case , and even for the lighter gravitino mass region such as kev @xmath2 100 kev .    on the other hand , comparing to the gauge - mediation type @xmath0 ball , we need to rephrase eq.([rho32trh ] ) in terms of @xmath20 . using eq.([m32mf ] ) , we obtain the constraint as @xmath101 which is shown in brown lines for each @xmath11 in fig.1 . as before , the constraint on @xmath76 stays almost constant and of the order of the susy particle mass for @xmath62 100 kev , as displayed by the brown dashed line in the figure .",
    "as can be seen , this type of @xmath0 ball can be the dark matter for @xmath102  gev , whereas the gravitino can be the ( cold ) dark matter for the opposite case @xmath3  gev .",
    "also the @xmath0-ball dark matter can exist for 60 ev @xmath2 kev , in particular , for @xmath103 .",
    "see eq.([m32mf ] ) .",
    "we have investigated @xmath0-ball dark matter in gauge - mediated susy breaking , and sought its direct detection .",
    "we have found that the @xmath0 ball can be the dark matter in the region of parameter space different from that for the gravitino dark matter",
    ". the @xmath0 ball will be the dark matter for the lower reheating case such as @xmath4  gev , whereas a higher @xmath76 is necessary for gravitino dark matter .",
    "moreover , dark matter @xmath0 balls could , in the future , be detected directly in the large - volume neutrino telescopes , such as icecube @xcite , baikal @xcite , km3net @xcite , and so on .",
    "in particular , the icecube experiment may detect the @xmath0 ball with their full volume and the slow - particle trigger in the near future @xcite .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of @xmath0-ball dark matter , whereas gravitino dark matter can not be found in collider experiments .",
    "finally , we make a comment on baryogenesis .",
    "the @xmath0-ball dark matter scenario requires a low reheating temperature ( @xmath4  gev ) .",
    "affleck - dine baryogenesis usually works at such a low reheating temperature . in this case , another flat direction than that which forms dark matter @xmath0 balls will produce the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "alternatively , nonthermal leptogenesis by right - handed neutrinos with nearly degenerate masses may operate at such low reheating temperature , although it should be higher than @xmath104  gev .",
    "affleck - dine leptogenesis @xcite may also work for @xmath105  gev . in these cases",
    ", icecube may detect @xmath0-ball dark matter in very near future experiments ( see figs.1 and 2 ) .",
