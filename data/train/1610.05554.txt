    "a sunspot represents a strong concentration of magnetic field in the photosphere .",
    "although a sunspot exhibits much fine - scale structure , it can be characterized by two regions with substantially different inclinations of the magnetic field .",
    "the central region , the _ umbra _ , contains predominantly vertical field , i.e. normal to the photosphere .",
    "surrounding the umbra is the _ penumbra _ , where the field is much more inclined to the vertical direction .",
    "since the umbra and penumbra sit in a convecting plasma , magnetoconvection ensues and produces much fine - scale structure @xcite .",
    "the different dynamics of the umbra and penumbra depend on the magnetic field inclination @xcite .",
    "although the ` horn ' geometry of a sunspot magnetic field has been known for a long time , exactly how it forms remains to be answered .",
    "observations show that particular sections of penumbrae form first .",
    "these are typically located on the antipodal , with respect to the emerging region , arcs of the umbrae .",
    "the phenomenon has been reported in many observational studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure 1 shows a sunspot at different times in the evolution of its penumbra . for our purposes",
    "we shall define two distinct spatial regions that are highlighted in figure [ obs ] ( a ) . the _ antipodal curve _ , ac , is the region where the penumbra first forms and is indicated by a border of crosses . the _ central emergence region _ ,",
    "cer , is the main emerging region between the two main active region sunspots and is indicated by an ellipse .",
    "figure [ obs ] ( a ) displays a spot before its penumbra has formed .",
    "later , in figure [ obs ] ( b ) , the penumbra grows along parts of the ac . in figure [ obs ] ( c ) ,",
    "the penumbra has now engulfed the ac and is fully developed except at a small location near the cer .",
    "\\(a )   ( b )   ( c )     as a penumbra represents a region of inclined magnetic field , how is it that such field collects initially in preferential locations along the ac , as shown in figure 1 ?",
    "recent observational studies have suggested that an _ overlying magnetic canopy _ must exist as a prelude to penumbra formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite go as far to state that  the magnetic field structure in the chromosphere needs to be considered in the formation process of the penumbrae \" .",
    "there are two possible origins for an overlying magnetic canopy .",
    "the first is that it existed in the atmosphere before the emergence of the active region .",
    "the second is that the canopy is somehow connected to the emerging region . since the first option would require the background atmosphere to combine many imponderables favourably ( e.g. field inclination , direction , location , etc . )",
    "we shall focus on the second option .    in this letter",
    "we propose that penumbra formation is a simple consequence of how the emerging magnetic field expands into the atmosphere .",
    "we argue this through analyzing the magnetic field structure of emerged flux tubes .",
    "the rest of the letter is outlined as follows : the model is presented , outlining the equations and modelling assumptions ; the magnetic field inclination is investigated in relation to its position relative to sunspots ; a discussion of the results concludes the letter .",
    "in this letter we are not concerned with producing the fine - structure of sunspot dynamics but the large - scale distribution of magnetic field inclination in an emerging region . to investigate this property we present simulations of magnetic flux emergence .",

    "we choose the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are typical for flux emergence studies @xcite .",

    "the flux tube is perturbed , in order to initiate its rise , with a density deficit proportional to @xmath44 . in the following simulations we take @xmath45 .",
    "the sizes of the regions that we consider in this letter are smaller than typical active regions , which have lengths of @xmath46 mm across .",
    "the regions we are modelling here have lengths of @xmath47 mm and are more comparable to large ephemeral regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is a modelling choice in order to be able to resolve different regions of the atmosphere .",

    "to investigate how the magnetic field inclination is distributed after emergence into the atmosphere , we consider three numerical experiments with different values of the axial field strength and the twist . these are @xmath48 : @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; @xmath51 : @xmath49 , @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath53 : @xmath54 , @xmath50 .      the process of flux emergence has been described at length in previous work @xcite . in short , however , as the magnetic field pushes into the atmosphere , the magnetic pressure dominates the surrounding plasma pressure and can push rapidly into the corona . figure [ field ] ( a ) displays a slice of the magnitude of the magnetic field strength in the @xmath55 plane from @xmath48 at @xmath56 .    above the photosphere @xmath57 there is a ` magnetic bubble ' that has expanded into the atmosphere .",
    "the bubble clearly expands over the footpoints ( sunspots ) of the emerging region . plotting field lines , as shown in figure [ field ] ( b ) in these regions , reveals more of the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular , the inclined field has both radial and azimuthal , relative to the sunspot center , directions .",
    "this geometry could be connected to observations of @xcite which show both radially and azimuthally directed penumbrae .",
    "figure [ field ] demonstrates that there is a clear change in the field inclination from vertical at the footpoints to near - horizontal at the antipodal regions",
    ". we shall now give a more quantitative description of the field line inclinations in the numerical experiments .      in order to give a quantitative measure of the field inclination",
    ", we produce kernel density estimates of the angle of the field to the vertical , @xmath58 .",

    "the parameter @xmath66 is called the bandwidth of the estimator . in order to calculate kdes we require a particular form for the kernel function . taking @xmath63 to be the probability density function for the normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance , the kde is @xmath67.\\ ] ] following @xcite",
    ", we choose a bandwidth that is suitable for unimodal distributions and has the form @xmath68 with variance @xmath69 . in this letter , @xmath60 will represent the number of grid points where @xmath70 is calculated .    in order to investigate the magnetic field inclination , we must select different regions for producing the kdes . in each of the three experiments , we consider two regions .",
    "the first is the _ overlying canopy region _ , ocr , which includes",
    "the ac and represents where the highly inclined field ( for penumbra formation ) collects .",
    "the second is the cer . for the ocr",
    ", we choose a region bounded at one side by the edge of the footpoint ( near - vertical field ) in the @xmath55 plane and enclosed within the photosphere / chromosphere region . in @xmath48 , for example , this region is given by @xmath34\\times[-110,-24]\\times[0,10]$ ] ( cf .",
    "figure [ field ] ( a ) ) .",
    "we only consider one ocr as the other is nearly identical by symmetry .",
    "the cer is defined to be the region between the lateral boundaries of the canopy regions . for @xmath48 ,",
    "this is @xmath34\\times[-24,24]\\times[0,10]$ ] .",
    "figure [ e1 ] ( a ) displays @xmath65 for the two regions described above for @xmath48 at @xmath56",
    ".    angles close to @xmath71 or @xmath72 represent near - vertical field . those close to @xmath73 represent near - horizontal field . when @xmath74 , @xmath70 is not calculated . in the ocr",
    "there is clearly a highy probability of finding near - horizontal field and a low probability of finding near - vertical field . in the cer",
    ", there is a more uniform distribution for all inclination angles .",
    "figure [ e1 ] ( b ) displays kdes corresponding to those in figure [ e1 ] ( a ) but for a potential field extrapolation instead of the full mhd model . to calculate the potential field",
    ", we use the technique described in @xcite . on the bottom boundary ,",
    "the photospheric @xmath75 profile from @xmath48 at @xmath56 is used . in calculating the potential field ,",
    "the size of our computational domain is slightly different compared to the mhd simulation .",
    "however , since the magnetic field decays rapidly before it reaches the boundaries in this simulation , we do not expect this change in size to have a significant effect on the results . in the ocr",
    ", there is again a strong bias towards the field being close to horizontal . in the cer",
    ", there is a greater probability of near - horizontal field than in the mhd case .",
    "however , compared to the ocr kde , this probability is less and there is more spread in the field inclination .",
    "qualitatively , the results of the mhd and potential models are very similar .",
    "the potential field extrapolation represents an emerged field with no current density or coupling to the background plasma . the fact that this model produces results that are very similar to the full mhd case suggests that the _ existence _ of magnetic canopies is not due primarily to the complexity of the emerged field ( e.g. current structure , supporting dense plasma , etc . ) .",
    "rather , it is the ease with which the emerged field can expand into the field - free atmosphere in the ocrs that facilitates the formation of highly inclined magnetic field .",
    "we add weight to this result by performing two other simulations with different twist and field strength values . for these experiments we have to define different sizes for the regions as the magnetic fields expand more , within the same time period , than in @xmath48 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the ocr is defined by @xmath34\\times[-110,-52]\\times[0,10]$ ] and the cer by @xmath34\\times[-52,53]\\times[0,10]$ ] . in @xmath53 ,",
    "the ocr is @xmath34\\times[-110,50]\\times[0,10]$ ] and the cer is @xmath34\\times[-50,50]\\times[0,10]$ ] .",
    "these regions are selected at time @xmath56 for @xmath51 and @xmath76 for @xmath53 .",
    "since the field strength is stronger in @xmath53 , its magnetic field expands faster and reaches the boundaries of the domain sooner than the others .",
    "figure [ e2e3 ] displays the kdes for @xmath51 and @xmath53 at the times and locations described above .    despite some peaks appearing in the kdes for the cers , the general features are still very similar to results from @xmath48 .",
    "the existence of distinct magnetic canopy regions in all of the numerical experiments is a robust feature .",
    "note that we do not calculate potential field extrapolations for @xmath51 and @xmath53 as the proximity of the emerged field to the computational boundaries will bias the results .      in the previous section",
    ", we demonstrated that magnetic canopies can exist for different values of field strength and twist .",
    "the canopy structure is also found in a potential field extrapolation using the photospheric boundary of @xmath48 .",
    "although the existence of magnetic canopies does not appear to be sensitive to the complexity of the emerged field , the formation of penumbrae will be affected .",
    "@xcite found that in order to produce extended penumbrae , the horizontal field ( canopy ) has to have a field strength that is approximately twice that of an equivalent potential field . in order to assess the effects of current density and plasma coupling on the canopy field strength",
    ", we shall present three cases from @xmath48 at @xmath56 .",
    "the first case is the potential field extrapolation discussed in the previous section .",
    "a potential field is one with no current or coupling to the background plasma and represents the extreme case of field relaxation .",
    "the second case is the full mhd model , where the magnetic field has a current density structure and also supports dense plasma , carried upwards from the photosphere during emergence .",
    "the third case represents a scenario somewhere between the first two cases . in order",
    "produce a field that is twisted but does not support any dense plasma , we re - run @xmath48 with the modified mass conservation equation , @xmath77 in equation ( [ newton ] ) we have added a relaxation term to drive the density to @xmath78 , its value at @xmath79 .",
    "the rate of relaxation is governed by @xmath80 . in this letter",
    ", we set @xmath81 throughout the domain .",
    "doing so allows for the density to relax rapidly to its initial condition on a time scale much faster than that of the formation of magnetic canopies .",
    "the result of running simulation @xmath48 with equation ( [ newton ] ) rather than equation ( [ mass_con ] ) is that the emerged field supports no dense plasma carried upwards from the photosphere . that is , draining is completely efficient and the density profile in the atmosphere at @xmath56 is the same as it was at @xmath79 .    in order to compare the canopy field strengths for the three cases listed above , we plot kdes of @xmath82 in an ocr .",
    "for the first and third cases , the dimensions of the ocr are as stated previously . for the third case , the field expands more by @xmath56 compared with the other cases and the limits in the @xmath83-direction are now slightly modified to @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "figure [ bmag ] displays the distributions of magnetic field strengths in an ocr for each of the three cases .    from figure [ bmag ] ,",
    "the typical field strength values of the potential case ( yellow ) are the weakest out of the three cases .",
    "its kde decays before @xmath85 . the modified density case ( orange )",
    "also has a kde that decays before @xmath85 and is concentrated at weak field strengths .",
    "however , in the modified density kde , there is a greater probability of finding higher field strengths of @xmath86 compared to the potential case .",
    "the full mhd case ( blue ) kde has a much larger spread in field strength values and extends to values much larger than the other cases .",
    "the above kdes profiles can be interpreted in terms of the complexity of the emerged field .",
    "the potential case has no current and does not support dense plasma .",
    "it represents a minimum - energy solution and so has the weakest field strength values .",
    "the modified density case mangetic field has twist ( non - zero current ) but does not support dense plasma .",
    "the twist in the field allows for greater field strengths compared to the potential case .",
    "finally , the full mhd case has an emerged field that is both twisted and supports dense plasma .",
    "the effect of the dense plasma on the canopies is to compress the field and produce stronger field strengths .",
    "the values found in the full mhd case can be an order of magnitude greater than those in the potential case .",
    "hence , the combination of twist and plasma coupling in the emerged field can produce field strengths required for the formation of extended penumbrae @xcite .",
    "in this letter we have presented simulations of flux emergence and have demonstrated , through visualizations and kdes of the field inclination , that they produce near - horizontal magnetic canopies at the antipodal curves of the footpoints .",
    "several observational studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that an overlying magnetic canopy is required to produce penumbrae .",
    "we show that the existence of such magnetic canopies is not sensitive to the complexity of the emerged field .",
    "the field strength of the canopies , which will influence the development of penumbrae , does , however , depend on the complexity of the emerged field . by considering three magnetic field models - potential , twisted but not supporting dense plasma , twisted and supporting dense plasma",
    "- we demonstrate that the inclusion of twist and plasma coupling can produce canopy field strengths greater than double the equivalent potential values .",
    "this means that current and plasma coupling in the emerged field can produce canopies that can , in turn , lead to the formation of extended penumbrae @xcite .",
    "although the simulations we present here are highly idealized and can not produce the fine - scale structure of sunspots , they have the advantage of being able to isolate particular physical processes whilst still being able to describe the large - scale features of flux emergence .",
    "one simplification that was made was to consider regions smaller than a typical active region .",
    "this decision was made in order to adequately resolve the photosphere / chromosphere region .",
    "it was shown that increasing the field strength does not alter the formation of magnetic canopies .",
    "indeed , the canopies grow more rapidly due to the faster expansion of the stronger emerging field @xcite .",
    "we expect our results to survive the inclusion of extra physics in the model .",
    "the inclusion of convection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will make emergence within the cer more complex .",
    "however , if the field is strong enough , convection should not prevent its expansion into the atmosphere and , hence , the formation of canopies .",
    "we also note here that our full mhd simulations can over - estimate the amount of dense plasma carried into the atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , our modified density model shows that canopies still form even if draining is completely efficient .",
