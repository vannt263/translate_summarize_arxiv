    "a long standing problem which has attracted much interest recently concerns the mechanism whereby spin  orbit interactions give rise to magnetic anisotropy in magnetic insulators .",
    "this subject , which was extensively investigated three decades ago , [ ] has recently been the object of renewed attention due to interest in the lamellar copper oxide systems .",
    "[ ] the first of these to be extensively investigated , la@xmath12cuo@xmath13 , has a small orthorhombic distortion away from a tetragonal structure [ ] and the above mechanism was shown [ ] to give rise to an anisotropic exchange , including that of the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii  moriya type . in that system",
    "there are two anisotropy energies .",
    "[ ] one of these , the out  of  plane anisotropy , is of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the @xmath16component of the staggered magnetization , the @xmath16axis is taken to be perpendicular to the copper oxide plane , and @xmath17 is an anisotropy constant .",
    "this energy causes the spins to lie in the basal plane .",
    "there is also an in  plane anisotropy energy which selects the orientation of the spins within the basal plane . until recently the discussions of the origins of anisotropy were confined to the orthorhombic structure",
    "however , more recently a family of copper oxide materials of similar structure , but which are actually tetragonal , have been studied [ ] and found to have roughly the same out  of  plane anisotropy as la@xmath12cuo@xmath13 .",
    "the earlier studies [ ] did not predict any anisotropy in the tetragonal limit . accordingly , a reanalysis of anisotropy for the tetragonal systems ought to show a common origin of the out  of  plane anisotropy which does not rely on the orthorhombic distortion .",
    "that is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "however , in the course of this work , we have found that a number of general questions concerning both the results and the methodology required some clarification , which this paper is intended to provide .",
    "a microscopic basis for superexchange between magnetic ions was first given almost forty years ago by anderson .",
    "[ ] in the language of a hubbard model , [ ] his calculation started from an orbitally nondegenerate band in which there is one electron per site in the limit of large coulomb interaction @xmath10 whenever two electrons occupy the same site .",
    "if the kinetic energy is completely neglected , each electron ( or hole ) may be characterized by its spin . when kinetic energy ( described by hopping ) is included perturbatively",
    ", one finds a spin hamiltonian , which in low order perturbation theory can be expressed as the sum of contributions @xmath18 from each bond @xmath19 .",
    "this spin hamiltonian describes the perturbative removal of degeneracy . in higher order in the hopping ,",
    "one encounters contributions to the spin hamiltonian from plaquettes ( at order @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a hopping matrix element ) and eventually from even higher order clusters . ignoring higher  order contributions , anderson obtained an isotropic exchange interaction between",
    "nearest  neighbor spins , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the hopping matrix element between sites @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "soon afterwards moriya [ ] used anderson s formalism to study the effect of spin  orbit interactions on superexchange between magnetic ions .",
    "he showed that for sufficiently low symmetry the most general effective spin hamiltonian for two spin 1/2 magnetic ions , such as cu@xmath27 , is of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a symmetric @xmath30 tensor .",
    "the first term represents the isotropic symmetric exchange .",
    "the second and third terms represent the antisymmetric and symmetric anisotropies , respectively .",
    "moriya s results were obtained to second order in the hopping perturbation , but in principle provided a framework in which the spin  orbit interaction could be included to arbitrary order .",
    "convenient explicit results were given to lowest nontrivial order in the spin ",
    "orbit coupling constant , @xmath5 .",
    "much more recently , thio _ et al . _",
    "[ ] found that la@xmath12cuo@xmath13 is described by eq .",
    "consequently coffey and co  workers , [ ] invoked this hamiltonian to describe the cuo planes in the cuprates .",
    "they found that @xmath31 can not be the same for all bonds @xmath32 , as was assumed by a number of previous authors .",
    "the form of the @xmath31 is determined by the symmetry properties of the crystal structure .",
    "the first attempt at a microscopic calculation of the vectors @xmath31 was made by coffey , rice , and zhang [ ] in the framework of the moriya theory of the anisotropic superexchange interactions .",
    "within this theory , @xmath31 is of order @xmath5 , whereas @xmath33 is of order @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , many authors neglected @xmath35 . naively , one expected a gap in the spin  wave spectrum due to anisotropy , and this is what one finds when @xmath33 is neglected .",
    "subsequently , shekhtman _",
    "et al . _ ( sea ) [ ] have shown that @xmath33 can _ never _ be neglected .",
    "most interestingly , when @xmath33 is included , they found a hidden symmetry in @xmath18 , as a result of which , inclusion of spin  orbit interactions did not reduce the degeneracy of the ground state of the pair of spins @xmath19 .",
    "[ ] their result was that @xmath18 could be written in the following form : @xmath36 where the vector @xmath31 is bond  dependent and @xmath37_{\\mu \\nu } = a_\\mu b_\\nu$ ] .",
    "as sea show , the result ( [ prl ] ) indicates that although the pair interaction is not of the isotropic form of eq .",
    "( [ hijeq ] ) , it is rotationally invariant and hence the energy level spectrum of the pair interactions consists of a singlet and a triplet , just as it would in the absence of spin  orbit interactions . in previous work the terms in @xmath31 and those in @xmath38",
    "were not treated on an equal footing , and therefore this hidden symmetry was never noticed .",
    "furthermore , sea showed that even though each individual bond might have this hidden symmetry , the crystal as a whole could have anisotropy because of the frustration caused by the competition between exchange interactions of different bonds .",
    "[ ] in particular , for la@xmath12cuo@xmath13 they found that the anisotropy was a result of this frustration .",
    "all the work cited so far relied on the idea , introduced by moriya , that the effect of spin  orbit interactions could be taken into account by a gauge transformation on the hopping between sites .",
    "as used by moriya to obtain results up to order @xmath39 , this formulation is correct and convenient .",
    "however , this formulation does not form a correct basis for calculations to higher order in @xmath40 . thus , as we shall see , the hidden symmetry of sea , although maintained at order @xmath41 for constant @xmath10 , is broken at order @xmath42 for constant @xmath10 or at order @xmath41 for nonconstant @xmath10 .",
    "( here constant @xmath10 means that the coulomb interaction between holes in two orbitals does not depend on which orbitals are involved . ) in addition , the calculations of shekhtman _",
    "et al . _ [ ] or bonesteel [ ] for the anisotropy of the cuprates were based on terms requiring the existence of a distortion from tetragonal symmetry .",
    "however , the easy plane anisotropy is observed [ ] to have similar magnitudes in both the orthorhombic and tetragonal cuprates isostructural to la@xmath43cuo@xmath44 .",
    "the main reason for the failure of the previous calculations to give anisotropy for the tetragonal cuprates was the fact that these calculations neglected the coulomb exchange interaction . from the results of barriquand and sawatzky",
    "( bs ) [ ] one can see that they partially included such interactions . however , it remained unclear which aspects of the bs results would persist when the calculation was pursued more systematically .",
    "in fact , in ref . it was shown that for tetragonal symmetry coulomb exchange interactions played a crucial role in determining the anisotropy .    in view of the above history",
    ", the following points remained to be clarified and are addressed in the present paper .",
    "1 ) one should generalize moriya s results for @xmath18 to the case of nonconstant @xmath10 .",
    "having done that , we find that when reduced to the case of constant @xmath10 , our present results differ in a small way from those of moriya , who overlooked some @xmath5-dependent contributions to the magnitude of the isotropic exchange interaction , @xmath45 .",
    "we also give general results for superexchange interactions , i. e. for the case when the copper ions are separated by an intervening oxygen ion .",
    "however , the results are given in a general form which can equally apply to systems of ions other than cu , as long as their ground state is orbitally nondegenerate .",
    "2 ) since earlier calculations for the cuprates omitted hopping between excited states of the cu ions , we have reanalyzed the role of symmetry at arbitrary order in the matrix elements @xmath46 which describe the effective hopping between copper ions .",
    "we find that in the absence of coulomb exchange interactions [ i. e. for @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , below ] , one recovers isotropic exchange for a simplified `` generic '' model which describes the complete 3d band for copper ions on a simple tetragonal bravais lattice .",
    "this isotropy is the result of the high symmetry of the crystal field levels and the resulting high symmetry of the hopping matrix elements .",
    "this result shows that in the absence of coulomb exchange terms , one retains isotropy in @xmath18 to all orders in both @xmath5 and @xmath47 and thus that inclusion of coulomb exchange interactions is essential to obtain anisotropic exchange interactions in the tetragonal case .",
    "3 ) for a tetragonal lattice we find that this accidental isotropy in @xmath18 is removed at order @xmath48 when coulomb exchange interactions are allowed and we give detailed expressions for the exchange anisotropy in terms of the hopping matrix elements and the matrix elements of the coulomb interaction .",
    "4 ) for a crystal with arbitrarily low symmetry ( i. e. when the crystal field states have no special symmetry ) , we expect to ( and do ) find a removal of degeneracy of the spin triplet .",
    "this breaking of rotational invariance occurs at order @xmath42 for the case of constant @xmath10 and at order @xmath41 when @xmath10 is nonconstant .",
    "these results modify the conclusion given in ref . .",
    "5 ) in contrast to all previous work , we also found an in  plane anisotropy originating from the anisotropy of the spin  wave zero  point energy .    most of the above results have been obtained analytically , both for the `` generic '' model ( with only cu ions ) and for the `` real '' model ( in which the cu ions are separated by oxygen ions ) .",
    "furthermore , we have corroborated our results by comparing them to results obtained by numerically diagonalizing the hamiltonian which describes all possible states of two holes on one bond .",
    "for the `` generic '' model , there are 20 single  particle orbitals , 10 on each copper ion , so that in all there are 190 two ",
    "hole states . for the `` real '' model",
    "there are six additional @xmath1 states on the oxygen ion , so there are 325 two ",
    "holes states in all . in the tetragonal case , where we know that the exchange interaction matrix @xmath49 [ see eq .",
    "( [ hjmn ] ) , below ] is diagonal , its values may be deduced from the values of the energy splittings of the ground manifold , as is discussed in appendix a.    briefly , this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first introduce `` generic '' and `` real '' hamiltonians and then discuss the perturbative framework we use to calculate the spin hamiltonian @xmath0 . the actual perturbative calculations of @xmath0 are described in sec .",
    "iii , although many of the details are relegated to appendices .",
    "here we give expressions for @xmath50 , @xmath31 , and @xmath33 up to order @xmath51 for the `` generic '' model and analogously for the `` real '' model , where @xmath52 represents coulomb interactions beyond the approximation in which the coulomb exchange @xmath53 is zero and @xmath54 is constant . the case of tetragonal site symmetry",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "iv for both the `` generic '' and `` real '' models .",
    "there we prove a theorem , valid to all orders in the hopping matrix elements and spin  orbit coupling , which says that for nearest ",
    "neighbor hopping , the complete spin hamiltonian is isotropic when coulomb exchange is absent . here",
    "we display explicitly the leading contribution to the anisotropic exchange when coulomb exchange is treated perturbatively . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the experimental consequences of these results .",
    "in particular we estimate the anisotropies and spin  wave gaps which our work would predict . in sec .",
    "vi we study the case of arbitrarily low symmetry for the `` generic '' model and show that the anisotropy in @xmath55 is of order @xmath56 for the case of constant @xmath10 and of order @xmath57 when @xmath10 is not constant . finally in sec .",
    "vii we summarize the conclusions of this work .",
    "a brief summary of our major conclusions has been given previously .",
    "in this section we introduce a general hamiltonian , versions of which will be studied in this paper .",
    "we start from the following generic model , [ ] which captures the symmetries of the cuprates . for holes which reside only on the cu ions ,",
    "this model is given by    @xmath58    here @xmath59 creates a hole in the @xmath17th spatial orbital , whose single  particle energy is @xmath60 , with @xmath16component of spin @xmath61 on the cu ion at site @xmath25 .",
    "in general we allow hopping with matrix elements @xmath62 between the @xmath17 orbital on site @xmath25 and the @xmath63 orbital on site @xmath26 .",
    "this hamiltonian also includes direct coulomb interactions between electrons on the same site ( scaled by @xmath54 ) and on different sites ( scaled by @xmath64 ) and exchange coulomb interactions between electrons on the same site ( scaled by @xmath53 ) and on different sites ( scaled by @xmath65 ) .",
    "our numerical work indicates that when @xmath66 , the effects of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are not qualitatively different from those of @xmath54 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "since the latter are often dominant , we shall neglect @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in principle one",
    "should also include coulomb terms with four states , @xmath67 .",
    "here we follow most of the literature and start with the simpler eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , which involves only the hartree  like terms @xmath54 and the simple coulomb exchange terms @xmath53 . equation ( [ ham ] ) can easily be extended to the `` real '' model in which we include p states on the oxygen ions , with hopping between them and the d states on the nearest ",
    "neighboring cu ions .      in this subsection",
    "we briefly discuss the basis states used in the perturbative scheme described in the next subsection .",
    "we first consider ions within a single  particle picture .",
    "we therefore start by considering the effects of the crystal field hamiltonian , @xmath68 , and the spin  orbit interaction , @xmath69 .",
    "the former is constructed so as to give the observed ionic levels .",
    "including only such energies the single  particle hamiltonian is @xmath70 where @xmath71 in which @xmath72 is the matrix element of the @xmath73component of the orbital angular momentum between the two single  particle states , and @xmath74 is the pauli matrix .",
    "we shall often present results for @xmath25independent matrix elements of @xmath75 .    for many purposes",
    "it is convenient to diagonalize the single  particle , single ",
    "site hamiltonian @xmath76 .",
    "we may choose the wave functions @xmath77 to be real , in which case the matrix elements @xmath78 are purely imaginary .",
    "as a result , every single  particle energy of @xmath76 is at least doubly degenerate .",
    "that is , the two linearly  independent wave functions which are related to one another by time reversal , @xmath79 belong to the same energy .",
    "we use greek indices to label the crystal field states in the absence of spin  orbit interactions and roman ones for the eigenstates of @xmath80 .",
    "the latter can be characterized by pseudospin quantum numbers , @xmath81 , and are associated with the creation operators @xmath82 .",
    "these operators are related to the @xmath83 s via @xmath84 where the unitary matrix @xmath85 is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a real scalar , @xmath88 is a real vector and @xmath89 is the @xmath90 unit matrix .",
    "this leads to @xmath91 where @xmath92 ( here the dagger operation on @xmath85 operates only in terms of the two by two matrices as in eq .",
    "( [ mmat ] ) and is not to be applied to the scripts @xmath25 , @xmath17 , or @xmath93 . )",
    "the transformation @xmath94 that diagonalizes the single  particle hamiltonian is in general different for each site .",
    "consequently , the single  site energies may depend on the site index .",
    "however , in certain situations , for example , in the presence of the tetragonal to orthorhombic distortion in la@xmath12cuo@xmath13 , it is possible to define the transformation such that the single  particle energies are site independent .",
    "this will be the case for some of the explicit calculations which are presented below for the cuprates .      for cu@xmath27 ions in a @xmath95 configuration we are dealing with an ionic ground state having one @xmath2 hole",
    "whose spin is arbitrary .",
    "when we include the oxygen ions in the model , those ions have filled @xmath1 bands in their ground state . in either case , in the absence of hopping , i. e. for @xmath96 , the many ",
    "electron ground state manifold is one in which one hole of arbitrary spin resides on each copper ion .",
    "the energy levels within this ground manifold , when the remaining terms in the hamiltonian , especially hopping , are considered , are the object of our study .",
    "when hopping is introduced as a perturbation , the splitting of the hitherto degenerate ground state manifold can be described by a spin hamiltonian , @xmath0 . in view of time",
    "reversal invariance @xmath0 will consist of two  spin interactions ( between nearest and further neighbors ) , four  spin interactions , and so forth . in the present paper most of our results will be for the nearest  neighbor two  spin coupling constants , except for the general theorem of sec .",
    "iv , which makes no assumptions about the specific form of @xmath0 . if we only consider two spin interactions between nearest ",
    "neighboring spins , we effectively write @xmath97 where @xmath98 indicates a sum over pairs of nearest  neighboring sites and for spins 1/2 @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 label cartesian components .",
    "we refer to the case when @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the kronecker delta function , as isotropic exchange .",
    "[ to avoid confusion between the two kinds of exchange , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) proportional to @xmath53 are referred to as coulomb exchange . ]",
    "appendix a contains a discussion of the possible anisotropies in @xmath18 .",
    "the major objective of this paper is to discuss the symmetry of the matrix @xmath104 and develop perturbative expressions for it on the basis of the generic hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) and its generalization to include the intervening oxygen ions .",
    "> from our point of view the most important early work was that of moriya , [ ] who studied a simplified version of the above model .",
    "the most significant simplifications necessary to obtain moriya s main result were to neglect the coulomb exchange , @xmath53 , and to assume constant @xmath105 , i. e. to assume that @xmath106 did not depend on either the site index @xmath25 or the orbital indices @xmath17 and @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath107 is independent of @xmath17 and @xmath63 , the wave functions for the two  hole states are slater determinants of the one  hole states as obtained by the canonical transformation of eq .",
    "( [ unitary ] ) .",
    "in other words , in this very special case , the exact eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath76 also diagonalize the coulomb interaction , @xmath108 . in terms of these new",
    "particle states the transformed hopping hamiltonian now assumes the form    [ eq14 ] @xmath109 where @xmath110 represents hops from site @xmath26 to site @xmath25 , and @xmath111 is the @xmath90 matrix @xmath112 in which @xmath113 @xmath114 is a real scalar ( vector ) , that can be found using eq .",
    "( [ i8 ] ) and the representation in which @xmath115 is real .    by hermiticity",
    "these coefficients obey @xmath116 actually ( and this seems to have caused much subsequent confusion ) , moriya did not write down eqs . ( [ i16a])([i16c ] ) . instead , in a further simplification , he truncated @xmath4 to include only hopping between the @xmath96 ground states . even for his calculations at order @xmath41 , this simplification is slightly incorrect .",
    "however , we should emphasize that this truncation is totally inappropriate for a discussion of effects of order higher than @xmath41 , since hopping between excited states then comes into play .",
    "also , when @xmath54 is not constant , hopping between exact eigenstates of @xmath117 is no longer a single  particle interaction . to see this note that there are matrix elements between an initial state , in which both holes are in their ground states on different ions , and a final state in which , for instance , both holes are in excited states of one ion .",
    "such a process explicitly relies on the fact that the two  hole states are not simply obtained from single  hole states .",
    "thus , in this case , when `` final  state interactions '' are present , the hopping perturbation involves four electron operators .    accordingly , to study the case when @xmath54 is not constant and when coulomb exchange is not neglected , we write @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and the additional coulomb terms resulting from nonconstant @xmath54 and @xmath53 take the form @xmath120 with    [ i14 ] @xmath121 @xmath122    expressions for @xmath123 and @xmath53 for tetragonal crystal",

    "bond numerical diagonalization , as we showed in fig .",
    "we end this discussion with two comments .",
    "first , note that the separation of @xmath431 into a sum of terms of orders @xmath432 and @xmath417 was only possible because the sums over @xmath93 and @xmath189 in eq .",
    "( [ iii21 ] ) all appeared within one matrix [ which appears between @xmath433 and @xmath434 .",
    "this would not have been possible if we had contributions of the kind @xmath435 , representing interference between different hopping paths .",
    "such contributions arise at order @xmath429 , and generate further anisotropy .",
    "[ without them , the analysis of appendix d indicates that the energy levels would be two singlets and a doublet ] .",
    "second , note that the symmetry contained in eq .",
    "( [ iii8 ] ) would persist to all orders , had we ignored excited states , allowing only @xmath436 .",
    "it is clear that the role of spin  orbit interactions in causing anisotropy in the exchange interaction is an interesting and subtle one . in particular , there has been much controversy concerning the way the exchange interaction @xmath437 depends on the crystal symmetry and under what conditions one expects to find a gap in the spin  wave spectrum . for a long time after moriya s seminal paper it was thought that one could neglect @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ jdmeq ] ) and that the spin hamiltonian for a single bond would be anisotropic if the dzyaloshinskii vector @xmath438 were nonvanishing .",
    "it was then observed by kaplan [ ] and by sea , [ ] that although @xmath35 is of order @xmath34 and @xmath438 is of order @xmath5 , one must nevertheless keep both terms when discussing the anisotropy or the gap in the spin  wave spectrum .",
    "two other conclusions of these authors were 1 ) the single ",
    "bond spin hamiltonian @xmath439 was rotationally invariant and 2 ) the overall anisotropy of the cu  o plane resulted from a frustration between bonds with different values of @xmath438 . in view of the results of the present paper we are in a position to state clearly the conditions under which the first conclusion is valid .",
    "in particular , our results show that rotational invariance ( when the coulomb exchange @xmath53 is zero ) of the single  bond spin hamiltonian to all orders in @xmath21 is only to be expected when hopping between excited states is ignored , as the sea argument does implicitly .",
    "we remark that since the spin ",
    "orbit interaction involves coupling to excited orbital states , it is only nonnegligible when the energies of the excited states involved are finite .",
    "this being the case , strictly speaking , it is not totally consistent to neglect hopping between such states , especially since the associated hopping matrix elements are comparable to those involving hopping to or from the orbital ground state .",
    "nonetheless , as we have seen , the departures from the sea rotational invariance theorem ( due to hopping between excited states ) are numerically quite small in most cases of physical interest .",
    "in fact , for the case of constant @xmath54 considered by sea , the deviations from rotational invariance only enter at order @xmath42 .",
    "in moriya s original work to order @xmath41 it was correct to ignore hopping between excited states because he considered the case when @xmath54 was a constant . in this case , as our results in sec .",
    "vi show , rotational invariance only breaks down at order @xmath42 , because one has to go to that high order for hopping between excited states to come into play .",
    "when @xmath54 is nonconstant , hopping between excited states leads to anisotropy in @xmath439 at order @xmath41 , as our results in sec .",
    "vi demonstrate .",
    "these results thus represent a generalization of those by moriya and by most of the literature which followed him and assumed constant @xmath54 .",
    "> from this discussion one might now conclude that spin  orbit interactions would lead to anisotropy for the cu  o planes as long as one includes hopping between excited cu states .",
    "however , the theorem of sec .",
    "iv shows that for the special case when the cu sites have tetragonal symmetry , the generic model of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) with only @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath54 nonzero does not yield nonzero anisotropy .",
    "the same result also applies to the `` real '' model including oxygen ions .",
    "this theorem explains why most previous calculations give no anisotropy for tetragonal site symmetry and it emphasizes the importance of including coulomb exchange terms , @xmath53 .",
    "it is then clear why the exchange anisotropy is so small , especially ( as noted by bs ) when compared to the anisotropy in the @xmath264 tensor .",
    "we thus find that for each bond the exchange interaction has biaxial anisotropy ( @xmath440 , @xmath441 , and @xmath442 are all different ) , where the anisotropy in @xmath45 is of order @xmath443 , or more correctly , it is of order @xmath444 or @xmath445 , where @xmath304 and @xmath305 are the racah parameters which represent deviations from the simple constant @xmath54 hartree term .    even though the single ",
    "bond exchange has biaxial anisotropy , the classical ground state energy , because it is averaged over bonds along [ 1,0,0 ] and [ 0,1,0 ] , does not select an orientation of the staggered magnetization within the easy plane . as we have shown , the anisotropy within the easy plane results from quantum zero  point fluctuations .",
    "in summary , a complete discussion of the anisotropy of the cu  o planes requires an interesting study of several novel symmetries and the way they are broken by fluctuations .",
    "we may summarize our conclusions as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) for tetragonal site symmetry , with only hartree  like direct coulomb terms , the effective spin hamiltonian is isotropic at any order in the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath5 .",
    "inclusion of coulomb exchange breaks this degeneracy at order @xmath446 for our generic model and at order @xmath447 for the cuprate system with an oxygen ion between the copper ions .",
    "\\(2 ) since the easy  plane anisotropy ( observed via the `` out  of  plane '' spin  wave gap at zero wave vector ) has comparable magnitudes for many orthorhombic and tetragonal cuprates , it can not depend significantly on the orthorhombic distortion .",
