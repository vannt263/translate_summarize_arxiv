    "<S> we describe a new method of calculation of master integrals based on solution of difference equations . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce our method immediately by means of an example . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the integral @xmath0 where @xmath1 . by using integration - by - parts@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one finds the recurrence relation @xmath2 this recurrence relation is a first - order linear _ difference equation _ with polynomial coefficients for the function @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a solution of can be written in the form of an expansion in factorial series @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are to be determined . by substituting the expansion in the difference equation with the help of the boole s </S>",
    "<S> operators@xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which allow one to rewrite as a series of powers of @xmath9 , one finds the values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the recurrence relation between the coefficients @xmath7 @xmath12 the first coefficient , @xmath13 , can be determined by comparing the large-@xmath14 behaviour of the series , @xmath15 , with the large-@xmath14 behaviour of the integral @xmath16 from which one infers @xmath17 . for large @xmath18 the coefficients @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> grow approximately as @xmath19 , similarly to coefficients of asymptotic expansions in powers of @xmath20 , but with the big difference that the factorial growth is compensated by the gamma function in the denominator of , so that the generic term of the sum behaves as @xmath21 and the series turns out to be _ convergent _ for @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a general feature of expansions in factorial series . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by using the recurrence relation we can evaluate @xmath23 for values of @xmath14 outside the domain of convergence of the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the on - mass - shell integral @xmath24 combining identities obtained by integration - by - parts one finds the recurrence relation @xmath25 where the function appears in the right - hand side . </S>",
    "<S> this is a nonhomogeneous difference equation of second order . </S>",
    "<S> the general solution of this equation has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are solutions of the homogeneous equation ( obtained by setting the right - hand side of to zero ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath31 is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation . as before , we look for solutions in the form of expansions in factorial series @xmath32 where we set @xmath33 . by substituting the expansions and in the difference equation </S>",
    "<S> one finds the values @xmath34 and the recurrence relations between the coefficients @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see immediately , the recurrence relation for @xmath41 is not needed . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be determined by comparing the large-@xmath14 behaviour of the series , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with the large-@xmath14 behaviour of @xmath45 @xmath46 one finds that @xmath47 and @xmath48 , therefore the solution @xmath28 can be discarded . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical value of @xmath29 may be alternatively obtained from evaluated at @xmath49 , in the form @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath23 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath45 calculated for @xmath53 are shown in table  [ tableij ] , with the first two terms of the expansion in @xmath54 ; we also show the number of terms of the factorial series needed to obtain the results with 16 exact digits . </S>",
    "<S> values for @xmath55 are obtained by using the recurrence relations and . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for small @xmath14 the convergence is slow , so that it is convenient to evaluate the series for @xmath56 , and to use repeatedly the recurrence relations in order to obtain @xmath3 or @xmath57 for the given value of @xmath14 ; note , however , that the recurrence relation is unstable so that each application increases the error on @xmath45 of a factor @xmath58 , and therefore a value of @xmath59 too large is not convenient .    </S>",
    "<S> we mention here that there is an alternative way to represent the functions @xmath3 , @xmath27 and @xmath31 by using the laplace s transformation@xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 satisfy the differential equations @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64    now we want to generalize the method used above to the calculation of master integrals of arbitrary diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a diagram with @xmath65 loops , @xmath66 internal lines and @xmath67 master integrals . </S>",
    "<S> defined a particular order of the denominators @xmath68 , we group the master integrals in different sets , such that each set contains the master integrals @xmath69 which have @xmath70 as first denominator : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , the indices @xmath73 depend on @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the numerators @xmath76 in general contain products of powers of some irreducible scalar products involving the loop momenta , which can not be simplified by algebraic identities with one of denominators </S>",
    "<S> . integrals @xmath77 , are ordered by increasing number of denominators and , for integrals with the same @xmath78 , by increasing sum of powers of scalar products contained in @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> changing the exponent of @xmath70 from 1 to @xmath14 in each master integral , we define the `` master functions '' @xmath79 in general , for each possible choice of @xmath70 equal to one of the denominators , a different function @xmath80 is defined ; but for @xmath81 they all must have the same value @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is particularly useful for checking the consistency of the calculations .    by combining by suitable algorithms@xcite the identities obtained by integration - by - parts , for each value of @xmath74 we build a system of linear difference equations in triangular form @xmath83 satisfied by the functions @xmath84 , with polynomial coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where the right - hand side of the @xmath75-th equation contains the functions from @xmath87 to @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the triangular structure is particularly useful for simplifying the numerical solution : the equations are solved one at a time , for @xmath89 ; when the equation for @xmath80 has to be solved , all the functions @xmath90 in the right - hand side are already known . </S>",
    "<S> therefore each single equation is similar to or , with the difference that , for integrals more complicated than , the order of the equation and the degree of polynomials of coefficients are generally larger , and the right - hand side contains the sum of several contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of each equation of the system has the form @xmath91 for integer values of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> each solution @xmath92 of the homogeneous equation , and the particular solution @xmath93 of the nonhomogeneous equation are expanded in factorial series @xmath94 values of @xmath95 , @xmath96 and recurrence relations between coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be found by using the operator method mentioned in the previous example ; the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 come from the already known expansions in factorial series of the nonhomogeneous term of . </S>",
    "<S> the recurrence relations between @xmath97 and @xmath98 are similar to , but in general they are of higher order , and the coefficients of the expansions of the functions @xmath90 appear in the right - hand side of the recurrence relations for @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between the large-@xmath14 behaviours of the factorial series and of the integral @xmath101 allows one to determine which constants @xmath102 are zero ( because the corresponding values of @xmath95 and @xmath103 are not compatible ) and which must be calculated .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the large-@xmath14 behaviour of the master function @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> choosing the momentum routing such that @xmath104 , introducing hyperspherical polar coordinates for the integration over @xmath105 and separating the angular and radial part , becomes @xmath106 where @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 the path of radial integration @xmath109 is the straight line @xmath110 $ ] for euclidean integrals . for non - euclidean integrals , in order to ensure a correct analytical continuation , the path @xmath109 must be deformed@xcite , turning around some singularities when the external momenta get over some values of threshold in the non - euclidean region ; for example , considering a one - loop self - energy integral with @xmath111 , the path must be deformed if @xmath112 . the integral for large @xmath14 receives contributions from a neighbourhood of the origin and from each singularity of the function @xmath113 which is on the path @xmath109 , turning points included .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider here only the case where the path @xmath109 is not deformed and all the masses are non - zero , so that there is only the contribution from the origin . </S>",
    "<S> more general cases will be discussed elsewhere . under this assumption and </S>",
    "<S> if , for simplicity , @xmath114 has a non - zero finite value , the large-@xmath14 behaviour of the master function is given by @xmath115 only the solutions @xmath92 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 equal to a non - negative integer have a large-@xmath14 behaviour compatible with ( often there is only one such solution ) .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath114 is expressed by an integral over @xmath118 , belonging to a diagram with _ </S>",
    "<S> one loop less _ , obtained by setting @xmath119 in the original integral ; it may be calculated by inserting an exponent in a denominator and building and solving new difference equations . if the integral contains @xmath120 on - mass - shell denominators @xmath121 ,  </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath122 , the large-@xmath14 behaviour of @xmath80 becomes @xmath123}{(q^2 - 2 p_1\\cdot q)\\cdots ( q^2 - 2 p_n\\cdot q ) } \\ , \\ ] ] @xmath124 if @xmath125 has a non - zero finite value . </S>",
    "<S> note that the number of dimensions of the integral in is the number of on - mass - shell denominators . </S>",
    "<S> an additional relation between constants @xmath102 may be found by evaluating at @xmath49 , as shown in the example .    </S>",
    "<S> once the values of the arbitrary constants @xmath102 are obtained , the factorial series must be summed . </S>",
    "<S> if the coefficients @xmath126 or @xmath127 grow as @xmath128 for large @xmath18 , with @xmath129 , the corresponding factorial series does not converge for any @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this may occur for particular values of masses and external momenta of the master integral . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we resort to the laplace s transformation mentioned in , by re - expressing as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 satisfy respectively homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations obtained by substituting these integral representations in the difference equation ; the differential equations are conveniently solved by expanding in power series the solutions around a number of points selected on the interval of integration .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the application of our method to the calculation of master integrals . </S>",
    "<S> considered the number of master integrals and the complexity of the systems of difference equations for diagrams with two or more loops , the use of an automated tool is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> we have written on purpose a comprehensive program , called @xmath133 , which automatically determines the master integrals of a diagram , builds the systems of difference equations and solves the systems numerically by using expansions in factorial series or integral representations . </S>",
    "<S> the program contains a simplified symbolic manipulator , used for solving the systems of integration - by - parts identities . </S>",
    "<S> expansion in @xmath54 of the results is obtained by expanding everywhere in @xmath54 and by manipulating truncated series by means of the arithmetical routines implemented in the program ; in this way all coefficients of expansions in @xmath54 are obtained in numerical form , divergent terms included . very high - precision results ( even 50 - 100 digits ) can be easily obtained , as the calculation of master integrals is reduced to the sum of convergent factorial or power series in one variable .    for illustrating the power of our method , we have calculated the master integrals of the diagrams shown in fig.[figureone ] for @xmath53 in the single - scale case , with all masses equal to one , with all the external lines on - mass - shell and , for box diagrams , the mandelstam variables set to @xmath134 and @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of master integrals is 3 , 3 , 14 , 21 , 17 , 6 , 5 , 11 and 11 , respectively for the diagrams ( a)-(i ) ( not counting subdiagrams which factorize , or with external lines united ) . </S>",
    "<S> the systems of difference equations between master functions generated by the program are formed with 44 , 28 , 245 , 304 , 362 , 68 , 81 , 139 and 158 equations , respectively ; at present the program makes no use of the symmetries due to the particular values of masses and momenta in order to simplify or reduce the number of the equations . </S>",
    "<S> note that for each subdiagram there may be several different master functions , according to which denominator is raised to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> use of laplace s transformation is required for obtaining the master integrals ( e ) , ( g ) and ( i ) . as an example , the calculation from scratch of all the master integrals of the diagram ( c ) , by using a precision of 38 digits , requested about 128 hours of cpu time on a 133 mhz pentium pc ; we stress that at this preliminary stage of development we directed our efforts to devise tests and cross checks rather than to speed up the program .    for brevity , we show here only the values of the master integrals with numerator equal to one , corresponding to the diagrams shown in figure , leaving the list of the remaining master integrals to a further more exhaustive paper@xcite . as usual , the results have been normalized with the division by @xmath136 raised to the number of loops of the diagram . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 of these results , only first two terms of and the first term of were already known@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remaining terms and other results are new .    in conclusion , in this work we have established a connection between recurrence relations obtained by integration - by - parts and difference equations . using theory of difference equation </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a new method of calculation of master integrals which can be applied to diagrams with any topology and any number of loops . </S>",
    "<S> high - precision results expanded at will in @xmath54 can be obtained easily . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the actual validity of the method , as first application , by calculating master integrals in the single - scale case . </S>",
    "<S> application of the method to different cases , for example diagrams with different masses , external momenta over threshold , or zero masses , which involves the solution of higher - order difference equations or more laborious determinations of large-@xmath14 behaviours , will be described in future papers . </S>"
