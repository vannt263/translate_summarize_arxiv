    "turbulence plays an important role in numerous astrophysical plasmas , from the solar corona and solar wind ( coleman 1968 ; belcher & davis 1971 ; tu & marsch 1995 ; goldstein , matthaeus , & roberts 1995 ) to star - forming molecular clouds and clusters of galaxies ( boldyrev , nordlund , & padoan 2002 ; narayan & medvedev 2001 ; cho & lazarian  2003 ; elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) . in general ,",
    "astrophysical turbulence is compressible , and the compressive component of the turbulence may play an important role in processes such as ion heating and the scattering of energetic particles ( li & habbal 2001 ; yan & lazarian 2004 ; chandran 2005 , 2008a ) .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on the non - compressive component of the turbulence , which generally dominates the energy at scales smaller than the collisional mean free path , since ( non - compressive ) alfvn waves experience negligible linear collisionless damping at wavelengths  @xmath9 much larger than the proton gyroradius  @xmath10 and frequencies  @xmath11 much smaller than the proton cyclotron frequency  @xmath12 ( barnes 1966 ) .    for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the non - compressive component of the turbulence can be modeled using incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , even in a low - collisionality plasma .",

    "b * is the magnetic field . ] and is referred to as `` imbalanced . ''",
    "turbulence in the solar corona and inner solar wind is imbalanced , with an excess of alfvnic fluctuations propagating away from the sun ( roberts et  al  1987 ; grappin et  al  1990 ; bavassano et  al  2000a , 2000b ; bruno & carbone  2005 ) . in order to model the heating of the solar corona and solar wind",
    ", it is of interest to determine the turbulent heating rate or cascade power in imbalanced mhd turbulence .",
    "different expressions for this cascade power have appeared in the literature ( see , e.g. , dobrowolny , mangeney , & veltri  1980 ; hossain et  al 1995 ; lithwick , goldreich , & sridhar 2007 ; beresnyak & lazarian 2008 ; chandran 2008b ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to clarify the conditions under which these different expressions are valid .",
    "we focus on the difference between situations in which the minority alfvn wave type ( which we take to be  @xmath3 ) is sustained by the reflection of @xmath2 fluctuations and situations in which the @xmath3 fluctuations are sustained by some form of forcing .",
    "although a number of studies have addressed the effects of cross helicity on the inertial - range power spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluctuations ( e.g. , grappin , pouquet , & lorat 1983 ; lithwick et  al 2007 ; beresnyak & lazarian 2008 , 2009 ; chandran 2008b ; perez & boldyrev  2009 ; podesta & bhattacharjee  2009 ) , we do not address the inertial - range power spectra in this paper .",
    "we consider alfvnic ( i.e. , transverse and non - compressive ) fluctuations in a stationary , inhomogeneous medium , with background density @xmath1 and background magnetic and velocity fields  @xmath4 and @xmath16 .",
    "the velocity and magnetic - field fluctuations  @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written in terms of the elsasser variables @xmath19 the equations for @xmath20 are ( velli 1993 , verdini & velli 2007 ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the sum of the thermal and magnetic pressure .",
    "the second term on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : els1 ] ) represents wave propagation at velocity @xmath24 in the frame of the plasma .",
    "the third and fourth terms on the left - hand side give rise to wave reflection .",
    "the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : els1 ] ) contains the nonlinear terms .",
    "nonlinear interactions arise only when oppositely propagating wave packets interact ( iroshnikov 1963 ; kraichnan 1965 ) . in this paper , we focus on turbulent fluctuations at the `` outer scale '' or energy - injection scale .",
    "we view these outer - scale fluctuations as a collection of @xmath2 and @xmath3 wave packets with correlations lengths  @xmath5 and @xmath25 perpendicular and parallel to  @xmath4 , where for simplicity we have taken @xmath5 to be the same for both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "the shearing of a @xmath26 wave packet at the outer scale is dominated by interactions with @xmath27 wave packets at the outer scale .",
    "since we take the fluctuations to be alfvnic in nature , @xmath20 is perpendicular to  @xmath4 , and the magnitude of the @xmath28 term in equation  ( [ eq : els1 ] ) is  @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rms amplitude of the @xmath26 fluctuations at the outer scale .",
    "the rate of shearing of @xmath26 wave packets by @xmath27 wave packets at the outer scale is thus @xmath31 nonlinear interactions between @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluctuations can be thought of as `` collisions '' between oppositely directed wave packets .",
    "if we consider some point  p moving with a @xmath26 wave packet at velocity  @xmath32 , the time required for this point to pass through an outer - scale @xmath27 wave packet is approximately @xmath33 ( where we have ignored the factor of  @xmath34 that results from the fact that the relative speed of point  p and the moving @xmath27 wave packet is  @xmath35 ) .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath36 if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 is approximately the fractional change in an outer - scale @xmath26 wave packet caused by shearing by outer - scale @xmath27 fluctuations during a single `` collision '' of duration  @xmath39 . if @xmath40 , then an outer - scale @xmath26 wave packet undergoes a fractional change of order unity in a time  @xmath41 , which is  @xmath42",
    "we take @xmath2 to be the dominant wave type , and assume that @xmath43 which implies that @xmath44 . throughout this paper , we focus on the strong - turbulence limit , in which @xmath45 we note that the conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are compatible if @xmath48 is sufficiently small .",
    "if a magnetized plasma is physically stirred by a set of objects distributed throughout its volume , and if the motions of the different stirring objects are uncorrelated , then this stirring will excite both @xmath2 and @xmath3 waves , with comparable power going into each wave type .",
    "if this stirring is the primary mechanism for exciting alfvnic fluctuations , then the resulting turbulence will be approximately balanced , with little cross helicity . however , volumetric forcing can play an important role in imbalanced turbulence if , in addition to the forcing , a large flux of the dominant @xmath2 fluctuations is launched into the plasma from the plasma boundary . if the forcing is weak , then @xmath49 will be small , the cascade time of the @xmath2 fluctuations will be large , and the @xmath2 fluctuations injected at the plasma boundary will propagate a large distance into the plasma before their energy cascades .",
    "the role of forcing is then different for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . within a certain distance of the boundary ( see section  [ sec : ex ] ) , forcing makes only a small contribution to the energy of the @xmath2 fluctuations , but is the mechanism that sustains the  @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "we note that if @xmath2 fluctuations satisfying equation  ( [ eq : chiplus1 ] ) are launched into the plasma from the plasma boundary , and if @xmath3 energy is not continually injected into the system throughout its volume , then @xmath3 energy will decay on the short time scale @xmath50 , leaving the system in a maximally aligned state , the state is called `` maximally aligned '' because @xmath17 and @xmath51 are everywhere anti - parallel . ] with vanishing cascade power ( dobrowolny et  al  1980 ; matthaeus & montgomery  1980 ; pouquet , sulem , & meneguzzi  1988 ) .",
    "we model the forcing of @xmath26 fluctuations as a stochastic source term  @xmath52 added to right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : els1 ] ) . for simplicity , we take the spatial variation of @xmath53 in directions perpendicular to @xmath4 to be characterized by a single scale length ( correlation length ) , which we set equal to the perpendicular correlation length of the outer - scale @xmath2 fluctuations ,  @xmath5 . we also take the spatial variation of @xmath53 along @xmath4 to be characterized by a single scale length , denoted @xmath54 , which can differ from  @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that the ( stochastic ) time variation of @xmath52 is characterized by the single time scale  @xmath56 .",
    "the properties of outer - scale @xmath3 wave packets are determined by both ( 1 ) the way in which the @xmath3 fluctuations are sheared by @xmath2 fluctuations and ( 2 ) the source term .",
    "we discuss these two mechanisms in turn and their consequences for the correlation time of the shearing that is applied by @xmath3 wave packets and experienced by a single , moving @xmath2 wave packet . because of equation  ( [ eq : chiplus1 ] ) , @xmath3 fluctuations can only propagate a distance  @xmath57 before their energy cascades to smaller scales . as a result ,",
    "if we consider the outer - scale @xmath2 wave packet labeled `` a '' in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , the outer - scale @xmath3 fluctuations encountered by wave  packet  a are sheared primarily by wave  packet  a and the outer - scale wave packet immediately `` ahead '' of wave packet  a , which is labeled wave  packet  b in figure  [ fig : f1 ] . since",
    "wave packet  b remains in front of wave packet  a as the two wave packets propagate along the magnetic field , the shearing experienced by the outer - scale @xmath3 fluctuations that are encountered by wave packet  a remains coherent throughout the cascade time of wave packet  a. on the other hand , the properties of the source term  @xmath53 in the region that contributes to the @xmath3 fluctuations encountered by wave packet  a decorrelates over a time scale @xmath58 , because of both the space and time dependence of  @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the coherence time for the shearing experienced by the outer - scale @xmath2 wave packets is ) is valid unless @xmath59 exceeds the @xmath2 cascade time  @xmath60 , in which case @xmath61 , and the cascade time and cascade power are given by equations  ( [ eq : epsm1 ] ) , ( [ eq : tcascpl2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : epsp3 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath62 we note that if @xmath63 , then because of equation  ( [ eq : chiplus1 ] ) the shearing experienced by outer - scale @xmath3 fluctuations will cause the @xmath3 fluctuations to vary strongly over a distance  @xmath64 along the field , causing @xmath65 to become comparable to  @xmath64 .",
    "however , in this case , the shearing experienced by the @xmath2 fluctuations remains coherent for a time @xmath59 rather than the collision time scale @xmath66 , for the reasons given above .",
    "wave packets propagating along the background magnetic field  @xmath67 . in this pictorial example , the parallel correlation length of the forcing term , @xmath54 is taken to be longer than the parallel correlation length of the outer - scale @xmath2 wave packets , @xmath64 .",
    "[ fig : f1],width=384 ]    we define the quantity @xmath68 we first consider the case in which @xmath69 when equation  ( [ eq : chihatm ] ) is satisfied , @xmath70 is approximately the fractional change in an outer - scale @xmath2 wave  packet during a time  @xmath71 . during successive time intervals of duration @xmath72",
    ", the incremental changes in the @xmath2 wave packet that are caused by the shearing of  @xmath3 fluctuations add like a random walk .",
    "thus , @xmath73 time intervals of duration  @xmath71 are required in order for the incremental changes in the @xmath2 wave packet to accumulate to an order - unity fractional change .",
    "the cascade time for outer - scale @xmath2 wave packets is then given by @xmath74 the cascade power in @xmath2 fluctuations , @xmath75 , is then ( beresnyak & lazarian  2008 , chandran  2008b ) @xmath76 if we set @xmath77 , then equation  ( [ eq : epsp1 ] ) reduces to the result of dobrowolny et  al  ( 1980 ) for isotropic turbulence . in the case that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : epsp1 ] ) as ( chandran  2008b ) @xmath80 because of equation  ( [ eq : chiplus1 ] ) , the cascade time for @xmath3 fluctuations is simply @xmath81 , and the cascade power in @xmath3 fluctuations is @xmath82 comparable to the value of  @xmath83 in equation  ( [ eq : epsp2 ] ) .",
    ", both @xmath83 and @xmath84 scale in the same way with @xmath85 , @xmath5 , and @xmath86 [ in particular , @xmath87 ( lithwick & goldreich 2003 ) ] .",
    "however , there is an additional dependence of @xmath88 on the inertial - range spectral indices , so that the fluctuation type ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) with the steeper inertial - range power spectrum has the larger cascade power .",
    "it was shown analytically by galtier et  al  ( 2000 ) and lithwick & goldreich  ( 2003 ) that this dependence becomes very strong as the spectral indices approach the limiting values at which the assumption of local interactions breaks down , so that the ratio @xmath89 can take on any value . in the strong turbulence limit @xmath90 , @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "also scale in the same way with @xmath85 and @xmath5 when @xmath91 and @xmath92 , as shown in equations  ( [ eq : epsp2 ] ) and ( [ eq : epsm1 ] ) .",
    "however , if @xmath83 and @xmath84 depend on the inertial - range spectral indices in the strong turbulence case as they do in the weak - turbulence limit , then additional coefficients ( not necessarily of order unity ) need to be included in equations  ( [ eq : epsp2 ] ) and ( [ eq : epsm1 ] ) .",
    "the presence of such coefficients would allow for the possibility of forced , steady - state , strongly turbulent flows in which @xmath89 differs significantly from unity , even when the assumptions leading to equations  ( [ eq : epsp2 ] ) and ( [ eq : epsm1 ] ) are valid ( i.e. , @xmath93 , @xmath92 , and @xmath94 ) . ]    if , instead of equation  ( [ eq : chihatm ] ) , @xmath95 then the shearing experienced by outer - scale @xmath2 wave packets remains coherent throughout their cascade time , @xmath96 and @xmath97 while @xmath84 is still given by equation  ( [ eq : epsm1 ] ) .",
    "turbulent heating rates of this form were previously obtained by hossain et  al ( 1995 ) on the basis of numerical simulations of decaying mhd turbulence , and by lithwick et  al  ( 2007 ) on the basis of theoretical arguments .      in this section , we consider a finite plasma that is stirred by a set of objects located throughout its volume .",
    "we take the dimension and spacing of these objects perpendicular to the magnetic field to be  @xmath5 , and we take the objects to be spaced by a distance @xmath64 along the magnetic field .",
    "we take the correlation time of the forcing to be  @xmath98 . in the absence of wave launching at the boundary , these stirring objects set up balanced mhd turbulence , in which the rms amplitudes of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluctuations are both equal to a quantity that we denote  @xmath99 .",
    "we define @xmath100 and assume that @xmath101 thus , in the absence of wave launching , the forcing would set up weak turbulence at the outer scale , with an outer - scale cascade time of @xmath102 and a cascade power of @xmath103    we now assume that @xmath2 waves are launched into the plasma from one its boundaries ( the `` launching boundary '' ) with correlation lengths @xmath5 and @xmath64 perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "we consider the region that is sufficiently close to the launching boundary that the amplitudes of the @xmath2 fluctuations have not decayed very much from their values right next to the boundary .",
    "( the size of this region is estimated below . )",
    "we assume that within this region , @xmath104 implying that @xmath105 .",
    "we also assume that the presence of the additional @xmath2 waves does not substantially alter the rate at which energy is injected into either the @xmath2 of @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations , denoted @xmath106 , is approximately @xmath107 , where @xmath108 represents an ensemble average .",
    "the value of @xmath20 can be thought of as consisting of two components , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is correlated with @xmath53 , and @xmath111 is not .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath106 is then @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the rms amplitudes of @xmath53 and @xmath110 . because the correlation time of @xmath53 in our example is @xmath98 , which is comparable to or shorter than the cascade time of each fluctuation type , @xmath115 for both wave types , so that @xmath116 .",
    "] since the cascade time for the @xmath3 fluctuations is short , the rate at which energy is injected into @xmath3 fluctuations will be in balance with the rate at which @xmath3 energy cascades to small scales .",
    "thus , @xmath117 equations  ( [ eq : defq0 ] ) through ( [ eq : zmex1 ] ) then lead to the relation @xmath118 which illustrates how the enhanced level of @xmath2 fluctuations reduces @xmath49 relative to its value ( @xmath99 ) in the absence of wave launching from the boundary .    determining the rate at which @xmath2 energy decays in this example is subtle .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : epsp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : zmex2 ] ) imply that @xmath119 which is comparable to the rate at which energy is injected by the forcing term .",
    "the question of whether the @xmath2 energy increases or decreases with increasing distance from the launching boundary thus depends upon the undetermined factors of order unity in equations  ( [ eq : defq0 ] ) and ( [ eq : epspex ] ) . to proceed , we conjecture that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 power spectra are `` pinned '' ( i.e. , equal ) at the dissipation scale ( grappin et  al 1983 ; lithwick & goldreich 2003  but see perez & boldyrev  2009 and beresnyak & lazarian  2009 ) , and that there is a dimensionless prefactor in the expression for @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) that increases as the @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) inertial - range power spectrum becomes steeper , as in the case of imbalanced weak mhd turbulence ( galtier et  al 2000 ; lithwick & goldreich 2003 ) .",
    "this implies that in the imbalanced case in which @xmath120 , the value of @xmath83 will be somewhat larger than both @xmath84 and @xmath121 , so that the @xmath2 energy will decay in time , when viewed from a frame of reference moving with the @xmath2 fluctuations at velocity @xmath122 .",
    "the time scale  @xmath60 for this decay is given approximately by equation  ( [ eq : deftcasc1 ] ) , with @xmath123 set equal to  @xmath64 .",
    "in the plasma frame , the @xmath2 energy then decays over a distance of @xmath124 , or ( since @xmath93 ) @xmath125 at distances @xmath126 from the launching boundary , the turbulence would then be highly imbalanced , with forcing sustaining the @xmath3 fluctuations but making only a small contribution to the energy in @xmath2 fluctuations . on the other hand , at distances @xmath127 from the launching boundary the turbulence would become approximately balanced .",
    "if our conjecture above about the relation between the cascade power and inertial - range spectral index in strong imbalanced turbulence is incorrect , then other phenomenologies are possible .",
    "in this section , we assume that the @xmath3 wave packets are generated by reflection of the dominant @xmath2 wave packets .",
    "the key difference from the last section is that the mechanism generating the @xmath3 fluctuations is now strongly correlated with , and in fact determined by , the properties of the @xmath2 fluctuations .",
    "we begin by considering outer - scale @xmath2 fluctuations that satisfy the `` critical - balance condition '' ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ; lithwick et  al  2007 ) , @xmath128 we consider the case @xmath129 at the end of this section . part of our motivation for considering outer scales satisfying equation  ( [ eq : cb ] ) comes from the work of cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2005 ) , who modeled the launching of alfvn waves into the corona and solar wind from the sun .",
    "they based their analysis on observations of photospheric motions and a model of wave propagation in the chromosphere , corona , and solar wind .",
    "they found that for heliocentric distances between 2 and  10 solar radii , the bulk of the wave power is at periods of @xmath130  minutes , with wave amplitudes such that equation  ( [ eq : cb ] ) is approximately satisfied .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : cb ] ) implies that the outer - scale @xmath3 wave packets only travel a distance  @xmath131 before their energy cascades to smaller scales .",
    "thus , the outer - scale @xmath3 fluctuations present at an arbitrary point  p originated within a distance  @xmath131 from  p. if we consider two outer - scale @xmath2 wave packets a and  b of length  @xmath64 and width  @xmath5 , with a right behind  b as in figure  [ fig : f2 ] , then the outer - scale @xmath3 wave packets encountered by wave - packet  a ( denoted @xmath132 in figure  [ fig : f2 ] ) will primarily be the @xmath3 field arising from the reflection of wave packet  b. if we assume that the gradient scale lengths of the background medium are at least as long as the `` damping length '' @xmath133 of the @xmath2 wave packet , then the @xmath3 wave packets encountered by wave packet  a will continue to have the same form and structure until wave packet  b changes . the shearing experienced by wave packet  a is thus coherent throughout its cascade time , rather than a random - walk - like accumulation of uncorrelated , small - amplitude distortions .",
    "the cascade time of wave packet a is therefore simply  @xmath134 , or @xmath135 which implies that @xmath136 as in the studies of hossain et  al ( 1995 ) and lithwick et  al  ( 2007 ) .",
    "wave packet ( @xmath137 ) encountered by the @xmath2 wave packet on the left ( a ) are determined by the @xmath2 wave packet on the right ( b ) .",
    "the shearing of wave packet  a by wave packet  @xmath137 thus remains coherent over a time comparable to the cascade time of wave packet  b. [ fig : f2],width=384 ]    lithwick et  al  ( 2007 ) argued that in strong , imbalanced , mhd turbulence , the shearing felt by the @xmath2 wave packets throughout the inertial range is coherent over a time that significantly exceeds the wave - packet `` collision time '' or crossing time , independent of the mechanism that generates the outer - scale fluctuations .",
    "our arguments differ from theirs in two ways .",
    "first , our discussion is restricted to the outer - scale fluctuations .",
    "second , we argue that equation  ( [ eq : tcasc_ref ] ) is valid when the minority @xmath3 wave type is generated by wave reflection , but not when  @xmath3 is generated by forcing that is only weakly correlated with the @xmath2 fluctuations ( unless @xmath138 , as described in section  [ sec : forced ] ) .    for the waves launched into the solar corona by photospheric motions",
    ", it is typically argued that @xmath139 at the coronal base , and that the alfvn waves at this perpendicular scale have a broad frequency spectrum , extending up to wave periods of many hours ( dmitruk & matthaeus 2003 , cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 , verdini & velli 2007 ) .",
    "although cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2005 ) find that the energy in outward alfvn waves ( @xmath2 in our discussion ) in the corona is dominated by waves with periods of @xmath140  minutes , wave reflection is more efficient for low - frequency waves",
    ". thus , if nonlinear wave - wave interactions were neglected , then the inward wave packets would have a longer parallel correlation length than the outward waves .",
    "we now explore the effects of frequency - dependent reflection , including the effects of nonlinear wave - wave interactions , by considering the limiting case in which the source term for inward ( @xmath3 ) waves is invariant along the magnetic field .",
    "the parallel correlation length of the @xmath3 fluctuations is given by the arguments of lithwick et  al  ( 2007 ) , as follows .",
    "we continue to assume the validity of equation  ( [ eq : cb ] ) , which is motivated for the coronal case by the results of cranmer & van ballegooijen s ( 2005 ) model of wave launching and propagation .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : cb ] ) implies that a @xmath3 wave packet can only travel a distance of order  @xmath64 before the wave packet is strongly distorted . since the @xmath2 fluctuations decorrelate over a distance  @xmath64 along the magnetic field , the inward waves acquire a parallel correlation length of  @xmath64 by interacting with the outward waves , even though the parallel correlation length of the source term for the inward waves is  @xmath141 .",
    "nevertheless , the coherence time for the shearing experienced by an outer - scale @xmath2  wave packet remains much longer than  @xmath142 .",

    "now , the source term for the inward waves is invariant along the magnetic field , but the properties of the @xmath3 wave packet ( @xmath143 ) encountered by the @xmath2 wave packet  a are determined by the way in which the @xmath2 wave packet  b shears the inward waves generated by the uniform source term . since wave packet a and b remain adjacent as they propagate outward along the magnetic field , the @xmath3 wave field encountered by wave packet  a will remain approximately the same until wave packet  b changes , i.e. , for a time equal to the cascade time of the outward waves . since the shearing of the @xmath2 wave packets is coherent throughout their cascade time , their cascade time",

    "in the solar corona , the dominant source of low - frequency , sunward - propagating , alfvn waves is likely wave reflection ( matthaeus et  al  1999 ; dmitruk et  al  2001 , 2002 ) .",

    "if these anti - sunward waves have enough time to develop a turbulent power spectrum extending to the ( perpendicular ) dissipation scale before they propagate out of the corona to larger heliocentric distances , then the cascade power and turbulent heating rate in the corona are given by equation  ( [ eq : epsp_ref ] ) , as in the studies of matthaeus et  al  ( 1999 ) , dmitruk & matthaeus ( 2003 ) , cranmer & van ballegooijen ( 2005 ) , and verdini & velli ( 2007 ) .",
    "the application of equations  ( [ eq : epsp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : epsp2 ] ) to the corona by chandran  ( 2008b ) was incorrect .",
    "the use of the correct equation in models of the coronal is critical , because the energy of anti - sunward waves dramatically exceeds the energy of sunward waves in the corona ( cranmer & van ballegooijen  2005 ; verdini & velli 2007 ) .",
    "when the correct expressions for @xmath83 and @xmath84 are used in models of the turbulent heating of open - magnetic - field - line regions in the solar corona , the heating rate is energetically sufficient to explain the acceleration of the fast solar wind for plausible assumptions about the amplitude and frequency spectrum of the waves launched from the sun ( matthaeus et  al  1999 ; dmitruk et  al 2002 ; cranmer & van ballegooijen 2005 ; verdini & velli 2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if equations  ( [ eq : epsp1 ] ) and/or ( [ eq : epsp2 ] ) were used , then the heating rate in these models would be much too small to explain the acceleration of the fast wind , because @xmath145 is so small in the corona .",
    "[ see cranmer & van ballegooijen  ( 2005 ) and verdini & velli  ( 2007 ) . ]    in the solar wind at low heliographic latitudes , the sunward - propagating alfvn waves may be driven primarily by instabilities resulting from shear in the solar - wind velocity ( roberts et  al  1992 ; breech et  al  2008 ) .",
    "it is not entirely clear how to model this process , but a reasonable first approximation is to treat the generation of sunward waves by velocity - shear instabilities as a form of mechanical forcing that is only weakly correlated with the anti - sunward waves . if we denote the parallel correlation length of this forcing as @xmath54 , and if @xmath92 , then the cascade power and turbulent heating rate are given by equation  ( [ eq : epsp1 ] ) , which is a factor of @xmath70 smaller than the value in equation  ( [ eq : epsp_ref ] ) ( beresnyak & lazarian  2008 ; chandran  2008b ) .",
    "if @xmath146 and @xmath79 , then the cascade power and turbulent heating rate are given by equation  ( [ eq : epsp2 ] ) ( chandran  2008b ) .",
    "the difference between the different expressions for the turbulent heating rate in reflection - driven turbulence and forced turbulence makes less of a difference in models of the solar wind at heliocentric distances of 1  au and beyond than in models of the corona , because @xmath145 is not so small .",
    "nevertheless , this difference may be significant when comparing model temperature profiles with observations , as shown in the recent study by ng et  al  ( 2009 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have argued that the cascade power in strong , imbalanced , incompressible mhd turbulence depends upon the mechanism that sustains the minority alfvn wave type  ( @xmath3 ) at the outer scale . if the outer - scale @xmath3 wave packets are sustained by the reflection of @xmath2 wave packets , then the shearing of the outer - scale @xmath2 wave packets remains coherent throughout their cascade time , a time that can greatly exceed the crossing time of two counter - propagating outer - scale wave packets . on the other hand ,",
    "if the outer - scale @xmath3 wave packets are sustained by some form of forcing that is only weakly correlated with the  @xmath2 fluctuations , then the coherence time for the shearing of the outer - scale @xmath2 wave packets is shorter than the cascade time , unless the parallel correlation length of the forcing function is very long ( i.e. , unless @xmath147 ) .",
    "the longer coherence time in reflection - driven turbulence enhances the cascade power in reflection - driven turbulence relative to forced turbulence with the same values of @xmath85 , @xmath5 , and @xmath25 .",
