    "improvements in the sensitivity and angular resolution of astronomical instruments have allowed the study of galactic and extragalactic jets in relative detail . in our galaxy ,",
    "jets have been observed directly in star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , planetary nebula ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in micro - quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic centre might also harbour a very faint jet generated in the vicinity of a super - massive black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of extragalactic sources",
    ", jets have been detected in the cores of active galaxies , some of them having relativistic speeds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "discrete components , which nature is still a matter of debate , are often seen receding from the unresolved core , where the engine responsible for their acceleration is supposed to be located ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the accumulation of observational data in a wide range of radio frequencies have shown that a large number of jets are not perfectly linear , exhibiting a bent shape that has been interpreted as due to jet - ambient interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hydro- or magnetohydrodynamical instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , jet rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , jet inlet precession ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a combination of them ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    concerning jet precession , @xcite developed an analytical model to study precession in the quasar 3c279 , which was also applied to the quasars 3c273 and 3c345 @xcite , the bl lac object oj287 and the seyfert galaxy 3c120 @xcite .",
    "the precession model parameters in those works were estimated from the position angles , velocities , and epoch of formation of the superluminal features in the radio jet , as well as from the long - term periodic variability at optical wavelengths in the case of oj287 , 3c345 and 3c120 .    in order to study jet precession ,",
    "it is necessary to monitor the motion of jet knots , collecting data during a long enough period of time ( two or more precession periods ) , with the interval between consecutive observations as short as possible .",
    "the reason for this is to avoid misidentification of the jet components , which can lead to the wrong determination of their kinematic parameters ( e.g. , proper motion ) , as well as to the wrong estimation of the precession parameters .",
    "however , note that such ideal monitoring is hardly achieved in practical situations .    aiming to overcome , or at least minimise the referred problems related to the jet precession analyses , we introduce a powerful statistical technique recently developed to deal with multi - extremal problems involving optimization : the cross - entropy method ( hereafter ce ) .",
    "the ce analysis was originally used in the optimization of complex computer simulation models involving rare events simulations @xcite , having been modified by @xcite to deal with continuous multi - extremal and discrete combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "its theoretical asymptotic convergence has been demonstrated by @xcite , while @xcite studied the efficiency of the ce method in solving continuous multi - extremal optimization problems .",
    "some examples of robustness of the ce method in several situations are listed in @xcite .",
    "the basic procedures involved in the ce optimization can be summarised as follows ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    1 .   random generation of the initial parameter sample , obeying predefined criteria ; 2 .",
    "selection of the best samples based on some mathematical criterion ; 3 .",
    "random generation of updated parameter samples from the previous best candidates to be evaluated in the next iteration ; 4 .",
    "optimization process repeats steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) until a pre - specified stopping criterion is fulfilled .    in this work",
    "we validate our ce jet precession model from a variety of benchmark tests built from synthetic precessing jet components .",
    "they show the great capability of our method to determine jet kinematic parameters without any identification scheme for the jet knots , as usually made in the literature . this paper is structured as follows : in @xmath1 2",
    ", we introduce the ce algorithm and the jet precession model used in the calculations . validation tests and the ce parameters are also presented in this section . the optimization results for each benchmark test of @xmath1 2 , as well as for three complementary tests are discussed in @xmath1 3 .",
    "conclusions are presented in @xmath1 4 .",
    "in this section we introduce the cross - entropy method , describing how to estimate the precession model parameters from the right ascension and declination offsets between the jet components and the unresolved core obtained from the model fittings of radio interferometric observations .",
    "let us suppose that we wish to study a set of @xmath2 observational data in terms of an analytical model characterized by @xmath3 parameters @xmath4 .",
    "the main goal of the ce continuous multi - extremal optimization method is to find the set of parameters @xmath5 for which the model provides the best description of the data @xcite .",
    "it is performed generating randomly @xmath6 independent sets of model parameters @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , and minimizing an objective function @xmath9 used to transmit the quality of the fit during the run process . if the convergence to the exact solution is achieved then @xmath10 .    in order to find the optimal solution from ce optimization",
    ", we start by defining the parameter range in which the algorithm will search for the best candidates : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 represents the iteration number . introducing @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we can compute @xmath15 from :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is an @xmath18 matrix with random numbers generated from a zero - mean normal distribution with standard deviation of unity .",
    "the next step is to calculate @xmath19 for each set of @xmath20 , ordering them according to increasing values of @xmath21 .",
    "then the first @xmath22 for our validation tests is discussed in section 3 . ]",
    "set of parameters is selected , i.e. the @xmath22-samples with lowest @xmath23-values , which will be labeled as the elite sample array @xmath24 .",
    "we then determine the mean and standard deviation of the elite sample , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , as :    @xmath27    @xmath28 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    the array @xmath29 at the next iteration is determined as :    @xmath30    this process is repeated from equation ( 2 ) , with @xmath17 regenerated at each iteration .",
    "the optimization stops when either the mean value of @xmath31 is smaller than a predefined value or the maximum number of iterations @xmath32 is reached .    in order to prevent convergence to a sub - optimal solution due to the intrinsic rapid convergence of the ce method",
    ", @xcite suggested the implementation of a fixed smoothing scheme for @xmath33 and @xmath34 :    @xmath35    @xmath36{\\bf \\sigma}^\\rmn{elite}_j(k-1),\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is a smoothing constant parameter ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 is a dynamic smoothing parameter at @xmath12th iteration :    @xmath40    with @xmath41 and @xmath42 is an integer typically between 5 and 10 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , such parametrisation prevents the algorithm from finding a non - global minimum solution since it guarantees polynomial speed of convergence instead of exponential @xcite .",
    ".precession model parameters used to generate artificially the right - ascension and declination offsets of the jet components .",
    "the sense of precession was chosen to be clockwise , with the precession period at the observer s reference frame corresponding to 14.20 yr . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      tests t1-t4 were constructed adopting clockwise precession in the models and in the optimisation procedure .",
    "the question that arises is what would happened if we had chosen the wrong sense of precession ?    in order to provide some quantitative answer to this question we used the t2-test data considering the opposite direction for jet precession @xmath43 .",
    "the ce parameters used in the calculations were @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which led to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the counterclockwise values are far from the real ones and they also produce a higher @xmath55 in comparison to the clockwise precession .",
    "therefore , our ce precession model can also indicate the correct sense of the jet precession , if included as a ce parameter .",
    "all optimization tests performed until now used a fixed period @xmath56 , the same used to build our artificial jet components .",
    "but what would happen if we had chosen another value for @xmath56 ?    to tackle this question , we made four optimization runs for t2 data with precession periods corresponding to @xmath57 , @xmath58,@xmath59 , and @xmath60 of the original value .",
    "the ce adopted parameters were @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the optimization results for the four periods are presented in table 4 .",
    "we can see that the minimum value of @xmath55 is obtained for the true period ; therefore , in a real situation in which this parameter is not well - constrained , we can run the algorithm for different values of the precession period , choosing the solutions that minimises @xmath55 .",
    "note that the inclusion of the precession period as an additional parameter to be optimised by the algorithm lengthens the completion of the calculations .",
    "our guess is that it might increase the duration of each run by at least a factor of 10 .",
    "this very rough estimate is based on a set of ce parameters as adopted in this work .      in figs .",
    "10 - 19 we show the model predictions for the core - component distances , and the right ascension and declination offsets for the t1-t5 tests .",
    "solid lines in these graphs represent the predictions from the ce optimisation adopting @xmath61 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "concerning core - component distance plots , the zero - separation epochs refer to those marked by the squares in figs . 2 - 4 , while the inclinations of the lines correspond to the proper motions obtained from the optimisation processes . in the case of right ascension - declination plots ,",
    "the continuous lines represent the snapshot of the precession helices generated from the derived precession model parameters .",
    "note that these calculations did not use any predefined identification scheme for the jet knots , as done in previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , it was not provided to the algorithm any information about which pairs of right ascension and declination offsets belong to a given component .",
    "it means that misidentification of the jet components due to the lack of a good time sampling of the observations , which might lead to the wrong determination of their kinematic parameters , is completely avoided in our method .",
    "therefore , it relaxes moderately the necessity of collecting data during a long period of time , with the interval between consecutive observations as short as possible .",
    "a good example of how misleading may be the identification of the jet components only based on kinematic features is test t4 presented in fig .",
    "6 . due to the sparse time coverage ,",
    "we are induced ( specially from the core - component distance plot ! ) to assume the existence of 7 to 10 non - ballistic jet knots , depending on the data association we made .",
    "obviously their kinetic parameters would differ completely from those calculated considering the correct number of ( ballistic ) components .",
    "it is important to emphasise that we are not claiming the nonexistence of non - ballistic jet motions which have been reported in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , some fraction of the bent motions might be the result of a misinterpretation of the observational data due mainly to their bad sampling in time , as the test t4 suggests .",
    "many astrophysical jets present signatures of precession , which were inferred from jet kinematics and/or continuum and line - profile periodic variability ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of jet kinematics",
    ", it is necessary to determine previously the apparent proper motions of the knots , as well as their trajectories on the plane of the sky that , on the other hand , depend on the correct identification of the jet components .    to deal with those potential difficulties ,",
    "we have implemented the cross - entropy method for continuous multi - extremal optimization with dynamic smoothing @xcite into our jet precession model ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as far as we know , it is the first case of application of the ce technique in astrophysics .    in this method ,",
    "tentative sets of precession model parameters are generated randomly from a normal distribution in each iteration , being the best candidates ( elite sample ) used to construct the next set of solutions .",
    "the elite sample was selected from the @xmath22-set of parameters that better minimises an objective function @xmath23 .    in order to validate our ce precession model",
    ", we constructed five sets of data , simulating right ascension and declination offsets between core and jet components , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "these artificial jet components were generated from different combinations of precession model parameters , assuming that they recede ballistically from the core after their ejection .",
    "for each of these tests , the ce precession method was applied to the data , aiming to recover the precession parameters used to create them .",
    "our results have shown that even in the most challenging tests , the ce method was able to find the correct parameters within @xmath0-level in most cases .",
    "the models included highly relativistic precessing jets , as well as a mildly relativistic jet with no precession .",
    "the ability to recover the correct precession model parameters was dependent on the cross - entropy parameters used in the optimization : all validation tests performed in this work seems to indicate that @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 improve the algorithm s efficiency .",
    "it is important to emphasise that such mapping is necessary since there is no theoretical proposition that points surely to which ce parameters must be used in the calculations to maximise the optimisation s efficiency ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "component identification problems related to fitting procedures , as well as observations sparsely sampled in time and sources with high rate production of jet components , may influence the follow up of the jet knots , which consequently might contribute to a kinematic misinterpretation of the data . in order to verify",
    "how sensitive is our algorithm to this issue , we performed the t4-test that consists of 50 precessing jet components generated to mimic eight non - ballistic knots .",
    "our technique was able to recover the original jet precession parameters , ignoring any previous components misidentification .",
    "note that the inclusion of random fluctuations in the right ascension and declination offsets decreases the ability of the algorithm in recovering the real precession parameters .    to keep the numerical execution of the algorithm within acceptable intervals",
    ", we fixed the precession period in the observer s reference frame and the sense of precession ( clockwise or counterclockwise rotation ) during the optimization processes .",
    "this practical limitation led us to perform additional tests to check the behaviour of the ce method when a wrong choice for the precession period or the sense of rotation is made .",
    "as expected , such additional runs clearly indicated that the minimum value of the objective function is obtained when the correct values for the precession period and sense of rotation are employed .",
    "our method was successful in pointing out the lack of precession in the case of test t5 ( mildly relativistic non - precessing jet ) , recovering the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 with a very impressive precision .",
    "although reasonable values have been also obtained for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the method failed completely to find the correct value for @xmath71 .",
    "this is not supposed to be a serious issue since we are modelling a non - precessing jet in terms of a precession model , which obviously can produce some inconsistencies in the results .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that our ce method can be useful in indicating the presence of any precession signature in the observational data .",
    "our results show the great potentiality of the ce method to study precession ( or the lack of ) in astrophysical jets , utilising only the time variation of the right ascension and declination coordinates of the knots .",
