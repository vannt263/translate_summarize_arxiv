    "one of the great unsolved puzzles in particle physics revolves around the generation of mass : how do particles become massive ?",
    "this question is answered in the context of the standard model by the higgs mechanism , which is evoked to break electroweak symmetry .",
    "it predicts the existence of a neutral scalar particle , the yet unobserved higgs boson .    in the standard model ,",
    "the coupling strength between a fermion and the higgs boson , the yukawa coupling , determines the fermion mass , which is not predicted by the theory . for all fermions ,",
    "this coupling is small , except for one particle : the top quark .",
    "the top quark mass is close to the electroweak breaking scale and its yukawa coupling is within a few percent of unity .",
    "those intriguing characteristics have lead some to speculate that the top quark itself is involved in electroweak symmetry breaking or that its mass is a fundamental parameter of a more basic , underlying theory .",
    "we currently know experimentally very little about both the higgs boson and the top quark .",
    "however , in the next few years , the cdf and d@xmath0 experiments at the fermilab tevatron collider will pursue a program of precision measurements of the top quark and will conduct an intensive search for the higgs boson .    in these proceedings , i will summarize our current experimental understanding of the top quark and discuss the prospects for precision measurements in the coming years .",
    "i will then give an overview of the strategies that will be used to search for the higgs boson .",
    "the top quark was discovered by the cdf and d@xmath0 collaborations in 1995@xcite .",
    "this discovery was not unexpected since the structure of the sm requires that there be an su(2 ) partner to the b quark .",
    "what did come as a surprise was the top quark s mass : 175 @xmath1 , about 35 times more massive than the b quark , the heaviest known fermion at the time . given its mass ,",
    "many properties of the top quark can be calculated within the standard model and are given in table  [ smtop ] .",
    "an interesting consequence of the very short lifetime of the top quark is that it decays before it has time to hadronize .",
    "there are therefore no top hadrons and the top quark can thus be studied as a `` free '' quark .    0.1 in    .",
    "_ top quark in th sm _ [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ , width=566 ]      the integrated luminosity required to observe or exclude a higgs boson as a function of higgs mass is shown in figure  [ final ] .",
    "the study finds that a sm higgs with a mass up to 135 @xmath1 can be excluded at 95% cl with 6 @xmath2 and up to 180 @xmath1 with 10 @xmath2 . with 15 @xmath2",
    ", one could obtain 3 @xmath3 `` evidence '' up to 135 @xmath1 .",
    "the study assumed a @xmath4 dijet mass resolution of 10% , b - tagging efficiencies of 75% on one of the b hadrons ( tight algorithm ) , and 60% on the other ( loose algorithm ) .",
    "acceptance and efficiencies for signal and backgrounds were estimated using a monte carlo simulation that parametrized the response of a generic run ii detector .",
    "the size of the bands on figure  [ final ] reflect a 30% uncertainty that includes b - tagging , mass resolution , background rate and other effects .",
    "with the beginning of run ii at the tevatron , the era of precision top physics has begun and the hunt for the higgs boson has resumed .",
    "this exciting period will be followed with the commissioning of the lhc , a true `` top quark factory '' .",
    "the measurements made in the next decade should allow us to determine whether the generation of mass for elementary particles is indeed described by the higgs mechanism of the standard model and whether the top quark plays a special role in the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
