    "observational evidences of an intracluster stellar population ( isp ) are mainly based on the identification of _ intergalactic _ planetary nebulae and red giant stars ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "overall , the data suggest that approximately 10% ( or even more ) of the stellar mass of clusters is contributed by the isp  @xcite .",
    "the usual scenario assumed to explain the finding above is that gravitational interactions between cluster galaxies , and interactions between the galaxies with the gravitational field of the cluster , lead to a substantial stripping of stars from the galaxies themselves .    here , supported by a curious coincidence , namely by the fact that _ the characteristic times of oscillation of a galaxy around its equilibrium position in the cluster tidal field ( ctf ) are of the same order of magnitude of the stellar orbital periods in the external part of the galaxy itself _",
    ", we explore the effects of interaction between stellar orbits inside the galaxies and the ctf .",
    "in fact , based on the observational evidence that the major axis of cluster es seems to be preferentially oriented toward the cluster center , n - body simulations showed that model galaxies tend to align , as observed , reacting to the ctf as rigid bodies  @xcite . by assuming this idealized scenario ,",
    "a stability analysis then showed that this configuration is of stable equilibrium , and allowed to calculate the oscillation periods in the linearized regime  @xcite .",
    "in particular , oscillations around two stable equilibrium configurations have been considered , namely : 1 ) when the center of mass of the galaxy is at rest at center of a triaxial cluster , and the galaxy inertia ellipsoid is aligned with the ctf principal directions , and 2 ) when the galaxy center of mass is placed on a circular orbit in a spherical cluster , and the galaxy major axis points toward the galaxy center while the galaxy minor axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane .    here , prompted by these observational and theoretical considerations , we extend a very preliminary study of the problem  @xcite , by evolving stellar orbits in a more realistic galaxy density profile : for simplicity we restrict to case 1 ) above , while the full exploration of the parameter space , together with a complete discussion of case 2 ) , will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that both cases are rather exceptional .",
    "most cluster galaxies neither rest in the cluster center nor move on circular orbits , but they move on elongated orbits with very different pericentric and apocentric distances from the cluster s center ; in a triaxial cluster many orbits are boxes and some orbits can be chaotic . these latter cases can be properly investigated only by direct numerical simulation of the stellar motions inside the galaxies , coupled with the numerical integration of the equations of the motion of the galaxies themselves .",
    "without loss of generality we assume that in the ( inertial ) cartesian coordinate system @xmath0 , with the origin on the cluster center , the ctf tensor @xmath1 is in diagonal form , with components @xmath2 @xmath3 . by using three successive , counterclockwise rotations ( @xmath4 around @xmath5 axis , @xmath6 around @xmath7 axis and @xmath8 around @xmath9 axis ) ,",
    "the linearized equations of the motion for the galaxy near the equilibrium configuration can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the antisymmetric tensor of components @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the principal components of the galaxy inertia tensor . in addition , let us also assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. , that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are all less or equal to zero ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the equilibrium position associated with eq .",
    "( 1 ) is _ linearly stable _ , and its solution is @xmath18 where @xmath19    for computational reasons the best reference system in which calculate stellar orbits is the ( non inertial ) reference system @xmath20 in which the galaxy is at rest , and its inertia tensor is in diagonal form .",
    "the equation of the motion for a star in @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23    in eq .",
    "( 4 ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the galactic gravitational potential , @xmath26 is the gradient operator in @xmath20 , and we used the tidal approximation to obtain the star acceleration due to the cluster gravitational field .    galaxy and cluster models    for simplicity",
    "we assume that the galaxy and cluster densities are stratified on homeoids .",
    "in particular , the galaxy density belongs to ellipsoidal generalization of the widely used @xmath27-models ( @xcite,@xcite ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total mass of the galaxy , @xmath30 and @xmath31    the inertia tensor components of a generic homeoidal density distribution ( in the natural reference system adopted in eq .",
    "( 8) ) , are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and so @xmath15 .",
    "note that , from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 9 ) it results that the frequencies for homeoidal stratifications _ do not depend on the specific density distribution assumed _ , but only on the quantities @xmath34 .",
    "we also introduce the two ellipticities @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "ratio vs. @xmath37 after an hubble time for the model galaxy at rest .",
    "@xmath38 is the initial distance of the star from the galaxy center , while @xmath39 is the maximum distance from the galaxy center reached during the simulation . ]",
    "a rough estimate of _ characteristic stellar orbital times _ inside @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mean galaxy density inside @xmath40 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the galaxy mass normalized to @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the galaxy `` core '' major axis in kpc units ( for the spherically symmetric @xmath47 hernquist model  @xcite , @xmath48 ) ; thus , in the outskirts of normal galaxies orbital times well exceed @xmath49 or even @xmath50 yrs . for the cluster density profile",
    "we assume @xmath51 where @xmath40 is given by an identity similar to eq .",
    "( 8) , with @xmath52 , and , in analogy with eq .",
    "( 10 ) we define @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "it can be shown ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite,@xcite ) that the ctf components at the center of a non - singular homeoidal distribution are given by @xmath56 where the dimensionless quantities @xmath57 are independent of the specific density profile , @xmath58 for @xmath52 , and so the conditions for stable equilibrium in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are fulfilled ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath59 is not a well measured quantity in real clusters , and for its determination we use the virial theorem , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the virial velocity dispersion , that we assume to be estimated by the observed velocity dispersion of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "thus , we can now compare the galactic oscillation periods :    & = & 2 , [ eqn14a ] + & = & 2 , [ eqn14b ] + & = & 2 .[eqn14c ]    ( for small galaxy and cluster flattenings , where @xmath62 kpc and @xmath63 , @xcite ) with the characteristic orbital times in galaxies .",
    "thus , from eq . ( 11 ) and eqs .",
    "( 14abc ) , it follows that _ in the outer halo of giant es , stellar orbital times can be of the same order of magnitude as the oscillatory periods of the galaxies themselves near their equilibrium position in the ctf_. for example , in a relatively small galaxy of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 gyr at @xmath67 ( i.e. , at @xmath68 ) , while for a galaxy with @xmath69 and @xmath70 the same orbital time characterizes @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) .",
    "ratio vs. @xmath37 after an hubble time for the same galaxy model as in fig .",
    "1 , when oscillating around its equilibrium position in the ctf . ]    in order to understand the effects of the galaxy oscillations on the stellar orbits , we performed a set of monte - carlo simulations , in which we followed the evolution of @xmath73 - @xmath74 `` 1-body problems '' over the hubble time by integrating numerically eq .",
    "( 4 ) . at variance with  @xcite , where we used simple and easy - to - integrate ferrers density profiles , here we study orbital evolution in a more realistic ( but also more demanding from the numerical point of view ) galaxy density profile , namely a triaxial hernquist model , obtained by assuming @xmath47 in eq . ( 7 ) .",
    "the gravitational potential inside the galaxy density distribution , in a form suitable for the numerical integration , was obtained by using an expansion technique useful in case of small density flattenings ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the initial conditions are generated by using the von neumann rejection method in phase - space ( for details see  @xcite ) : note that , at variance with the analysis  @xcite , now `` stars '' are characterized by initial velocities that can be different from zero .",
    "the code , a double - precision fortran code based on a runge - kutta scheme , runs on gravitor , the geneva observatory 132 processors beowulf cluster ( * http://obswww.unige.ch/~pfennige/gravitor/gravitor_e.html * ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath73 orbits usually requires 2 hours when using 10 nodes .",
    "we show here , as an illustrative case , the behavior of the ratio @xmath75 as a function of @xmath37 , for a moderately flattened galaxy model ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , with @xmath78 , semi - mayor axis @xmath79 kpc , and maximum oscillation angles equals to 0.1 rad .",
    "the cluster parameters are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and the total number of explored orbits is @xmath83 . in order to show the effect of oscillations , in the following simulations we artificially eliminated the _ direct _ contribution of the ctf , as given by the second term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( 6 ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the result of a first simulation in which the galaxy is _ not _ oscillating : obviously , the ratio @xmath75 is in general ( slightly ) larger than unity , due to the initial velocity of each star . in fig .",
    "2 we show the result for the same galaxy model , when oscillating around the equilibrium position : the effects of the galaxy oscillations are clearly visible as a global `` expansion '' of the galaxy . as a reference ,",
    "the solid line indicates the expansion ratio required to reach the representative distance of @xmath84 from the galaxy center .",
    "thus , it is clear that the galaxy oscillations are certainly able to substantially modify the galaxy density profile . in particular , it will be of interest the study of the ( more realistic ) case in which the galaxy is in rotation around the cluster center . in this case",
    "we expect a different behavior of stellar orbits as a function of the distance of the galaxy center of mass from the cluster center : in fact , while inside the cluster core the ctf is _ compressive _ ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite,@xcite ) , outside the ctf is _ expansive _ along the cluster radial direction , and in this latter case its direct effect should increase the expansive effect due to the galaxy oscillations . these cases are discussed in detail in  @xcite ."
