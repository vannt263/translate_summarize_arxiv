    "the study of super - planckian collisions dates back to the late 80 s @xcite .",
    "today s renewed interest @xcite stems from the possibility that the fundamental scale of gravity may be much lower than the observed gravitational scale @xcite . in braneworld scenarios , the observed weakness of the gravitational field is due to the `` leakage '' of gravity in the extra dimensions : standard model ( sm ) fields are constrained in a four - dimensional submanifold , whereas gravitons are allowed to freely propagate in the higher - dimensional spacetime @xcite . if the gravitational coupling constant is of the order of few tevs , the physics of super - planckian collisions could soon be detected through observation of subnuclear black holes ( bhs ) and other extended objects , such as branes , in particle colliders @xcite or ultrahigh - energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) observatories @xcite .",
    "( for reviews and extra references , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the semiclassical limit of super - planckian scattering suggests that the cross section for creation of a bh or brane with radius @xmath0 is approximately given by the geometrical black disk @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of the colliding quanta and @xmath3 is the number of extra dimensions .",
    "gravitational objects with mass of order of the fundamental gravitational scale @xmath4 have radius of order @xmath5 . in symmetric compactification models ,",
    "the size of extra dimensions is much larger than @xmath5 .",
    "( for conventions , see ref.@xcite . )",
    "thus the spherical approximation is justified ; the geometry of nonperturbative objects is that of a @xmath3-dimensional bh .",
    "the spherical approximation breaks down for asymmetric compactifications , where some of the extra dimensions have size of order of the fundamental planck scale . in that case",
    ", the geometry of nonperturbative objects is that of strings and branes @xcite .",
    "uhecrs are attractive because of their high c.m .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon cross section for formation of bhs and branes is very small compared to other sm hadronic processes .",
    "the neutrino - nucleon cross section for bh or brane formation may be higher than the cross section of the sm process , thereby giving interest to neutrino interaction . under the most favorable circumstances , the cross section for bh formation at the tev scale reaches millions of pb for neutrino - nucleon collisions in the atmosphere .",
    "the cross section for brane production is expected to be even larger .",
    "these results have led to the claim that uhecr detectors might observe bhs and probe planckian physics .",
    "event observables would be the secondary products of the bh or brane after their formation , i.e.  extensive air showers originated by field emission in the decay phase .",
    "hawking evaporation provides an emission mechanism for bhs @xcite .",
    "sm quanta are emitted in the visible three - brane and can be detected .",
    "branes may or may not evaporate , depending on their properties .",
    "however , the decay spectrum of massive excitations in string theories has been shown to be thermal @xcite .",
    "this suggests that bh and brane decay signatures may be similar .",
    "the observational signatures of bh events in the semiclassical approximation have been investigated in a number of recent publications . in ref .  @xcite the authors found that bh interactions generate different air showers from sm interactions .",
    "bh air showers tend to rise faster and have larger muon content .",
    "a bh event produces a hadronic air shower occurring at a much greater depth in the atmosphere , i.e. , a very deeply penetrating hadronic air shower .",
    "however , the inability of realistic detectors to observe the first interaction point hides most of the difference between bh and sm air showers . given that present observatories are not large enough to study a large number of neutrino events , discrimination of bh and sm events is likely not to be achieved in the near future .",
    "another characteristic of bh air showers is @xmath6 generation .",
    "although the rate for these events is low if the ultrahigh - energy neutrino flux is at the level of the expected cosmogenic neutrinos , unusual `` double - bang '' air showers could signal a departure from sm interactions .    whereas the semiclassical picture seems reasonable , the actual physics of subnuclear",
    "bh formation could be very different . in the last year or two , significant advances in the understanding of microscopic bh formation and air shower evolution have appeared in the literature .",
    "it is thus timely and worthwile to re - examine the observational signatures of bh air showers . to this purpose",
    ", we developed a thorough fortran monte carlo ( mc ) code to simulate the air showers induced by bh formation in neutrino - air collisions , which includes these theoretical refinements @xcite .",
    "the mc has the same structure of the mc used in ref .",
    "the code generates observable secondaries from bh evaporation using the pythia generator @xcite .",
    "these secondaries are then injected into the aires simulator @xcite as primaries for the final air shower .",
    "the purpose of our study is threefold .",
    "firstly , we want to confirm the main findings of the previous investigation .",
    "secondly , we want to test various proposals of bh vs.  sm air shower discrimination that have appeared in the literature , such as the @xmath6 `` double bang '' effect @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we want to look for new ways of discriminating between different models of bh formation and evolution .    our analysis will show that the main characteristics of bh air showers are essentially independent of the details of bh evolution . because of large uncertainties and statistical fluctuations in air shower detection , it is also practically impossible to discriminate between alternative models of bh formation and evaporation .",
    "for instance , we will show that there is no significant observational difference between a model of bh formation based on the semiclassical black disk and the trapped - surface model @xcite , or between a model of bh evaporation with final explosive decay and stable remnant @xcite .",
    "these results limit significantly the use of bh air showers ( if they exist ) to probe details of `` new physics '' .",
    "we will also show that newly proposed signatures do not help in the task of discriminating bh vs. sm air shower detection .",
    "no observational trace of the `` double bang '' signature can be extracted from a realistic detector in the near future .",
    "in this section we briefly review the basics of bh formation and evolution , focusing on recent theoretical advances that have been included in the mc code .",
    "thorne s hoop conjecture @xcite states that a horizon forms when a mass @xmath7 is compacted into a region with circumference smaller than twice the schwarzschild radius @xmath8 in any direction . at subnuclear level , this can be achieved by scattering two partons @xmath9 on the brane with c.m .",
    "energy @xmath10 and impact parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this event can formally be described by the process @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes collisional energy that does not contribute to the bh mass .",
    "this energy includes a bulk component of gravitational radiation and perhaps non - sm gauge fields , and a brane component of sm fields .",
    "if @xmath13 is zero , the hoop conjecture implies that the cross section for bh production is independent of the impact parameter ( as long as @xmath11 ) and equal to the geometrical black disk @xmath14 . if @xmath15 , the cross section depends on the impact parameter , and is expected to be smaller than the black disk cross section .",
    "it is worth stressing that this picture is correct only if the bh is larger than the compton length of the colliding quanta .",
    "( for discussions on the effect of wave packet size on the bh formation process , see ref.@xcite . )",
    "a precise calculation of the collisional energy loss is essential to understand bh formation .",
    "many papers have been devoted to improve or disprove the hoop conjecture .",
    "the most popular model is currently the trapped - surface model @xcite , although alternative techniques have been explored @xcite .",
    "the trapped - surface approach gives an upper bound on the gravitational component of @xmath13 by modelling the incoming partons as two aichelburg - sexl shock waves @xcite .",
    "the aichelburg - sexl wave is obtained by boosting the schwarzschild solution to the speed of light at fixed energy .",
    "the resulting metric describes a plane - fronted gravitational shock wave corresponding to the lorentz - contracted longitudinal gravitational field .",
    "the parton scattering is simulated by superposing two shock waves travelling in opposite directions .",
    "the union of these shock waves defines a closed trapped - surface that allows to set a lower bound on the bh mass .",
    "the collisional energy loss depends on the impact parameter and increases as the number of spacetime dimensions increases .",
    "the bh mass monotonically decreases with the impact parameter from a maximum of about 60 - 70% of the c.m .",
    "energy for head - on collisions .",
    "the trapped - surface result is consistent within one order of magnitude with the hoop conjecture .",
    "however , the partons are assumed to be pointlike , massless , spinless , and electrically neutral .",
    "the pointlike assumption fails for directions transversal to the motion @xcite .",
    "colliding partons generally have spin and charge .",
    "while size and spin effects are expected to be mostly relevant around the planck energy , charge effects could dominate at higher energy .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that the trapped - surface model provides only a lower bound on the bh mass .",
    "an accurate estimate of the gravitational collisional energy loss would require the use of the full non - linear einstein equations in higher dimensions .",
    "since this is a virtually impossible task , alternative approximated models have been investigated .",
    "the gravitational energy emission in a hard instantaneous collision can be computed in the linearized limit @xcite .",
    "this approach suggests that the trapped surface method overestimates the gravitational energy emitted in the process . for head - on collisions ,",
    "the instantaneous method predicts the gravitational energy loss to be only about 10% of the c.m .",
    "this result is in agreement with a perturbative calculation modelling the parton - parton collision as a plunge of a relativistic test particle into a bh with mass equal to the c.m .",
    "energy @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "known methods for the estimate of the gravitational loss in relativistic scattering at parton level give a bh mass ranging between 60% and 100% of the c.m",
    ".  energy .",
    "today , the trapped - surface value and the black disk value can be considered as the lower and upper bounds on the bh mass , respectively .",
    "the total cross section for a super - planckian event involving a nucleon is obtained by integrating the above cross section over the parton distribution functions .",
    "bhs formed in a neutrino - nucleon collision may dominate over the sm processes and stand a fair chance of detection . on the contrary ,",
    "the branching ratio of the bh cross section in a nucleon - nucleon collision is @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , bh detection in nucleon - nucleon interactions can not be achieved with current and next generation detectors due to the low flux of uhecrs .",
    "if the bh mass depends on the impact parameter , the generally accepted formula for the total cross section of the neutrino - nucleon process is @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite with four - momentum transfer squared @xmath19 , and fraction of the nucleon s momentum carried by the @xmath20-th parton @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath26 is a form factor .",
    "the total cross section for the black disk model is obtained by setting @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "different sets of pdfs are defined in the literature .",
    "the pdfs are not known at energies above the tev and for values of momentum transfer expected in bh formation .",
    "equation ( [ totcross ] ) is usually calculated by imposing a cut - off at these values .",
    "the pdfs also suffer from uncertainties at any momentum transfer ( @xmath29 10% ) @xcite and from the ambiguity in the definition of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the momentum transfer is usually set to the bh mass or the inverse of the schwarzschild radius .",
    "although recent literature inclines toward the latter , there are no definite arguments to prefer either one or to exclude alternative choices .",
    "the uncertainty due to the ambiguity in the definition of the momentum transfer is about @xmath31% @xcite .",
    "the form factor and the amount of trapped energy depend in principle on energy , gravitational scale , geometry and physical properties of the extra dimensions and gravitational object .",
    "the trapped - surface method gives numerical values of order unity for these quantities .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite and discussion above ) . however , these results depend on the way the trapped - surface is identified . other models @xcite give values which are more or less consistent with the trapped - surface method . with the lack of further insight , it is common practise in the literature to either choose the trapped - surface result or the simple black disk model .",
    "the lower cutoff on the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the partons is set by the minimum - allowed ( formation ) mass of the gravitational object , @xmath25 .",
    "this threshold is expected to roughly coincide with the mass for which the semiclassical description is valid .",
    "this conclusion is motivated for spherically symmetric bhs by the following argument @xcite : for @xmath32 few , the hawking entropy of the bh should be large enough to neglect strong gravitational effects .",
    "the semiclassical results are then extrapolated for smaller values with the assumption that the bh or its planckian progenitor decays on the brane . however , this argument is based on hawking s semiclassical theory and may not be valid at energies equal to few times the planck mass .",
    "for example , the existence of a minimum spacetime length @xmath33 implies the lower bound on the bh mass @xcite : @xmath34 bhs with mass less than @xmath35 do not exist , since their horizon radius would fall below the minimum - allowed length . at fixed @xmath4 ,",
    "the minimum - allowed mass grows as a power of @xmath36 . for @xmath37 or @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ", it follows @xmath40 .",
    "it is believed that the decay of microscopic bhs happens in four distinct stages : i. radiation of excess multipole moments ( balding phase ) ; ii .",
    "spin - down ; iii .",
    "hawking evaporation ; iv . final explosion or formation of a bh remnant .",
    "phases i - iii rely on semiclassical results , provided that the entropy is sufficiently large .",
    "phase iv is in the realm of quantum gravity .",
    "although some progress has been made , the understanding of balding phase and spin - down phase is still fragmentary .",
    "for example , the emission of radiation from a @xmath41-dimensional rotating bh on the brane is known only for spin-0 fields @xcite .",
    "due to these limitations , some of these theoretical results can not be implemented in mc simulations at the present stage .",
    "moreover , phase i is not expected to lead to a significant amount of energy loss and the observational uncertainties ( see below ) are likely to dominate the theoretical uncertainties in phase ii .",
    "many papers have been devoted to the investigation of the hawking phase .",
    "although several analytical and numerical results have been obtained @xcite , from the viewpoint of numerical simulations the situation is similar to the balding and spin - down phases .",
    "for instance , greybody factors for the graviton are not fully known in @xmath41-dimensions even for the spherically symmetric bh .",
    "this precludes their use in numerical codes , where a consistent use of greybody factors is required .",
    "the field content at trans - planckian energies is also not known .",
    "onset of supersymmetry , for example , could lead to other evaporation channels for the bh and large emission of non - sm or undetectable quanta during the decay phase . finally , quantum effects may also affect the emission of visible quanta on the brane .",
    "quantum corrections to the hawking phase can be phenomenologically described by assuming the existence of a minimum length of the order of the planck length @xcite .",
    "the existence of a minimum scale is a common consequence of most ( if not all ) theories of quantum gravity such as string theory , non - commutative geometry and loop quantum gravity .",
    "the presence of a cutoff at small spacetime distances leads to a modification of the uncertainty principle at planck scales .",
    "since the hawking thermodynamical quantities can be derived by applying the uncertainty principle to the bh , the existence of a minimum length leads to corrections in the thermodynamical quantities @xcite .",
    "at the end of the hawking phase , the bh is expected to either non - thermally decay in a number @xmath42 of hard quanta or leave a remnant . in either case",
    "we must content ourselves with a phenomenological description , due to the lack of a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "the final non - thermal decay is usually described by setting a cutoff on the bh mass of the order of the planck mass , @xmath43 , and then equally distributing the energy @xmath44 to a number @xmath42 of quanta .",
    "since the decay is non - thermal , and in absence of any guidance from a theory of quantum gravity , the quanta are democratically chosen among the sm degrees of freedom .",
    "note that @xmath44 does not necessarily coincide with @xmath25 .",
    "the former gives the threshold for the onset of quantum gravity effects , whereas the latter gives the minimum - allowed mass of the classical object . from the above definitions , it follows @xmath45 .",
    "the existence of a minimum length gives a natural means to set @xmath44 . in that case",
    ", the modified thermodynamical quantities determine the endpoint of hawking evaporation when the mass of the bh reaches @xmath35 .",
    "this mass can be identified with the mass of the bh remnant @xcite .",
    "in this section we list the main characteristics of the mc generator used in the simulations @xcite . the physics of bh formation and decay is determined by the following set of external parameters and switches in the mc code :    1 .",
    "fundamental planck scale ; 2 .",
    "number of extra dimensions ; 3 .   gravitational loss at bh formation and gravitational loss model ; 4 .   minimum bh mass at formation ; 5 .   quantum bh mass threshold at evaporation ; 6 .",
    "number of final quanta at the end of bh decay ; 7",
    ".   momentum transfer model in parton collision ; 8 .",
    "conservation of electromagnetic ( em ) charge ; 9 .",
    "minimum spacetime length .",
    "the above parameters are briefly explained below .",
    "a more detailed explanation can be found at the mc generator web site @xcite .",
    "the mc does not require any lower or upper bound on the planck mass @xmath4 .",
    "however , experimental constraints exclude values of @xmath46 tev and large values of @xmath4 do not allow bh formation in the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 must be chosen with caution .",
    "since @xmath47 and @xmath48 are excluded experimentally , and most of the theoretical models are limited to @xmath49 , the number of extra dimensions @xmath3 ranges from 3 to 7 .",
    "the mc includes three models for bh formation and cross section : black disk , yoshino - nambu ( yn ) trapped - surface model @xcite , and yoshino - rychkov ( yr ) improved trapped - surface model @xcite .",
    "this allows a comparison between air showers based on the black disk model @xcite and air showers generated by bhs with significant gravitational loss at formation .",
    "observable differences between different models of bh formation can be investigated , as suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the minimum bh mass @xmath25 is set in units of @xmath4 or @xmath35 ( if a minimum length is present , see below ) .",
    "this parameter is always larger than one , i.e.  @xmath50 .",
    "the distribution of the initial bh masses is given by the differential cross section @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the mc uses the ( stable ) cteq5 pdf distribution @xcite .",
    "since the use of different pdf distributions produces an insignificant uncertainty in the total and differential cross sections , other pdf distributions are not implemented in the mc .",
    "the uncertainty due to the choice of the momentum transfer is generally larger .",
    "therefore , a switch allows to choose between bh mass or inverse of the schwarzschild radius as definition of momentum transfer .    the part of c.m .",
    "energy of the neutrino - nucleon system which is not trapped or lost in gravitational radiation at formation is attributed to the nucleon remnant . for sake of simplicity ,",
    "only neutrino - proton collisions are implemented in the mc code",
    ". a neutrino - neutron collision does not produce significant statistical differences in the nucleon remnant compared to a neutrino - proton collision .",
    "the proton remnant is successfully fragmented according to qcd in mesons / baryons ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) and then is decayed with the pythia generator along with the quanta created in the bh evaporation process .      due to the lack of results for the balding and spin - down phases described above , energy losses in these stages",
    "are assumed to be either negligible or included in the energy loss during formation .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the trapped - surface model likely overestimates the actual energy loss .",
    "balding and spin - down effects are also not expected to produce detectable differences in bh air showers , given experimental uncertainties and statistical fluctuations . nevertheless , keeping an open mind , we plan to include balding and spin - down effects in updated versions of the code , as soon as theoretical results become available .",
    "a similar conservative approach is used in the hawking phase , where only thermally - averaged greybody factors in four dimensions are implemented in the mc .",
    "this is justified by consistency reasons in the code ( the full greybody factors for all fields are not known ) . as the sm fields are emitted on the brane , and given the observational uncertainties , the difference between thermally - averaged and exact greybody factors is not expected to be detectable .",

    "this result can be qualitatively explained by noticing that most of the c.m .",

    "therefore , different choices of bh parameters do not produce large observable effects in the air shower development .",
    "the main factors determining the bh evolution ( bh mass distribution , energy and spectrum of emitted quanta ) are difficult to disentangle because their variations do not act to coherently increase or decrease the shower maximum .",

    "the left panel shows the profile of all the particles in the air shower .",
    "the right panel shows only the profile of the secondary particles from the @xmath6 decay .",
    "note that the y axis of the right panel is magnified 10 times w.r.t  the left panel .",
    "the peaks between 500 g  @xmath71 and 1500 g  @xmath71 are originated by multiple @xmath6 events with one @xmath6 decaying high in the atmosphere.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "we simulated extensive air showers initiated by tev - scale bh events produced from neutrino interaction in earth s atmosphere .",
    "these simulations were performed with an advanced fortran mc code @xcite that includes most of the theoretical results of the recent literature .",
    "the bh air showers were compared to sm air showers and different models of bh formation and evolution were investigated .",
    "we also studied exotic signatures of bh events , such as the `` @xmath6 double bang '' signature .",
    "our goal was to test various proposals of bh vs.  sm air shower discrimination and look for new ways of differentiating models of bh formation and evolution .",
    "our results show that the main features of bh air showers are largely independent of the details of bh formation and evolution .",
    "statistical fluctuations and limitations in detection techniques hinder the discrimination of alternative theoretical or phenomenological models .",
    "no difference between the black disk model and alternative models of bh formation , or between bhs with final explosive decay and stable remnant , can be detected with current uhecr observatories .",
    "distinguishing sm and bh air showers with hybrid detectors is possible if enough statistics is gathered .",
    "the most promising way is to measure the air shower maximum with a fluorescence telescope and count muons at ground .",
    "the double bang signature can not be observed by any realistic detector at the present stage .",
    "these results imply that the theory of tev - scale bhs in uhecrs is robust , but bh air showers are hardly to probe details of `` new physics '' in the near future .",
