    "in this paper we studied the behavior of energy centroids in the presence of random interactions .",
    "first we show that results of energy centroids are robust regardless of inclusion of isospin , based on numerical calculations .",
    "we find that @xmath67 ( and @xmath278 ) values can be classified according to their @xmath30 values .",
    "the simple relation , @xmath279 for each individual run , is confirmed and discussed .",
    "we see @xmath64 with both neutrons and protons shows a similar pattern to that of @xmath105 with only identical particles discussed in earlier works .",
    "second , we find in this paper that for @xmath20 boson systems the feature of @xmath2 s is robust with inclusion of random _ three - body _ interactions . results of @xmath60 , the probability for @xmath2 to be the lowest in energy , and @xmath6 ( and @xmath280 ) , obtained by using the tbre , are also applicable to those by using random three - body interactions , except that the value of coefficient @xmath12 in the relation @xmath281 increases linearly with boson number @xmath23 .",
    "third , such regular patterns can be generalized to energy centroids with given irreducible representations of groups for boson systems as well as fermion systems .",
    "we consider energy centroids with fixed irreps of the @xmath158 limit of @xmath159ibm , and energy centroids with fixed wigner s spin - isospin supermultiplet @xmath160 irreps for @xmath161 shell nuclei .",
    "we see that the lowest and highest irreps @xmath33 carry most of the cases that @xmath2 is the lowest in energy , and the energy centroids propagate via quadratic casimir invariants .",
    "the above results , such as energy centroids with fixed @xmath30 value , energy centroids of spin @xmath1 states under random three - body interactions , energy centroids of fixed irreps of the ibm models and shell models , are discussed by using propagation equations .",
