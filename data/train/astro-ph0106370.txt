    "perhaps the longest unsolved problem in astrophysical spectroscopy is that of the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , a series of hundreds of absorption lines present in the visible spectra of nearly all reddened stars .",
    "it is now generally believed that the diffuse interstellar bands are caused by free molecules in the gas phase @xcite , but despite many decades of effort by astronomers and molecular spectroscopists , there has been no match between any subset of the diffuse bands and the gas - phase laboratory spectrum of an individual molecule .",
    "many astronomers and molecular spectroscopists were hopeful that this impasse had finally been broken when j.  p.  maier s group reported @xcite a possible match between the gas - phase spectrum of c@xmath1  and five dibs in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "the promising laboratory bands are all vibronic bands of the lowest electronic transition ( @xmath3 ) of c@xmath1 .",
    "the strongest of the reported bands , the origin ( @xmath4 ) band at 6270.2  , seemed to match the strong @xmath26270 dib .",
    "the other four laboratory bands which seemed to match the dibs were the @xmath5 band at 5612.8   ( dib at @xmath25610 ) , @xmath6 at 5747.6   ( @xmath25748 ) , @xmath7 at 6063.8   ( @xmath26065 ) , and the combination band @xmath8 at 4963   ( @xmath24964 ) .",
    "all five of these laboratory transitions seemed to agree with dibs within about 2  , which is far closer agreement than had been achieved by any previously proposed dib carrier .",
    "many of the astronomical observations of the dibs were at the limit of the sensitivity , as were the laboratory observations . because it was not possible to infer the rotational or spin - orbit constants of c@xmath1  from the laboratory work , it was unclear how the bands might shift in wavelength or profile as a function of temperature .",
    "for these reasons , agreement within @xmath02   was sufficient to warrant further investigation .    using initial data from our dib survey @xcite",
    ", we confirmed the existence of four of the five dibs , but had reservations about the @xmath25748 band . with data from four reddened stars",
    ", it appeared that these four dibs agreed reasonably well in both wavelength and relative intensities , given the uncertainties in the laboratory data .",
    "additionally , in these four sources ( hd 46711 , hd 50064 , hd 183143 , and cygnus ob2 12 ) the four bands seemed to vary together in intensity .",
    "recently , j.  p.  maier s group has obtained laboratory data on the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 bands of c@xmath1  with considerably higher resolution and sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the authors performed theoretical calculations to estimate the ground- and excited - state rotational and spin - orbit constants , and then varied the spin - orbit constants to best fit their experimental spectrum .",
    "since the overall profile of the spectrum is very different as the spin - orbit constants are varied , this approach results in a fairly unambiguous determination of the molecular constants ( though not as unambiguous as would be possible from a fully rotationally - resolved spectrum ) . with the constants determined from the experiment",
    ", it is now possible to predict how the c@xmath1  spectrum will change with temperature .",
    "such predictions are essential in performing a detailed comparison with the dibs .    at the same time , our dib survey has progressed to the point where we now observe at least some of the bands attributed to c@xmath1  in the spectra of over twenty reddened stars . additionally , our data reduction pipeline has improved substantially , such that the aliasing which limited the signal - to - noise in our earlier work has been completely eliminated .",
    "these advances in both the laboratory and astronomical spectroscopy have prompted us to re - examine the case for c@xmath1  as a diffuse band carrier .",
    "the observations reported here are part of our long - term survey of the dibs in a large sample of stars .",
    "high resolution ( @xmath9 37,500 ) visible ( 400010000  ) spectra have been obtained with the astrophysical research consortium echelle spectrograph ( arces ) on the 3.5-m telescope at the apache point observatory .",
    "data reduction is performed using standard iraf routines , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "a more complete description of our dib survey will be given in a future paper .",
    "given the constants from @xcite ( @xmath10=897 mhz , @xmath11=887 mhz , @xmath12=27.4 @xmath13 , and @xmath14=0.6 @xmath13 ) , we used the method of @xcite to calculate the energy levels of c@xmath1  and the intensity factors for the individual rotational lines within a given vibronic band .",
    "[ we assumed the same constants for each vibronic band , as the vibrational dependence of the constants is expected to be smaller than the uncertainty in the determined constants . ] the populations of the rotational states of c@xmath1  were then calculated using a boltzmann expression at a given temperature , from which we were able to simulate the absorption spectrum .",
    "temperatures between 10 k and 90 k were considered , as diffuse clouds can be expected to have temperatures within this range . for the linewidth of each transition , we assumed a gaussian profile with full - width at half - maximum 10 km / s , which is the fwhm of the observed k i lines in hd 185418 and hd 229059 ( two stars we have chosen for the comparsion due to their narrow k i lines ) .",
    "we begin by considering the @xmath15=1/2 spin - orbit component of the origin ( @xmath4 ) band of c@xmath1 , in comparison with the @xmath26270 dib .",
    "the origin band is naturally the strongest of the laboratory features , and @xmath26270 is also by far the strongest of the dibs suggested to correspond to c@xmath1 .",
    "figure [ origin ] shows the spectra of @xmath26270 toward hd 185418 and hd 229059 , along with the simulations of the c@xmath1origin band at temperatures of 10 , 30 , 50 , and 70 k. as can be seen from the figure , neither the central wavelengths nor the profiles of the c@xmath1   spectra agree with the @xmath26270 diffuse band .",
    "this disagreement argues strongly against the assignment of @xmath26270 to c@xmath1 .    in figure [ originsat ]",
    "we consider both the @xmath15=1/2 ( left ) and @xmath15=3/2 ( right ) components of the c@xmath1  origin band .",
    "because @xmath15=3/2 is higher in energy , the intensity of the right - hand component increases with temperature , as evident in the simulations at 30 , 60 , and 90 k. in figure [ originsat ] , an ( unreasonably large ) _ ad hoc _ gaussian linewidth of 30 km / s has been assumed in order to improve the agreement with @xmath26270 .",
    "it is difficult to state with certainty because of the presence of the strong @xmath26284 dib , but it appears that there is little evidence for the @xmath15=3/2 component in the astronomical spectra .",
    "however , because the intrinsic profile of the strong @xmath26284 dib is not known , the presence of the @xmath15=3/2 component can not be definitively ruled out .",
    "figure [ band110 ] compares the simulated spectrum of the @xmath5 vibronic band of c@xmath1  to the @xmath25610 dib . in this case",
    ", the wavelength discrepancy between the c@xmath1  band and the dib is particularly egregious , over 2  .",
    "in addition , the profile is considerably different  the simulated spectrum shows a sharp band - head , while the dib has a fairly gaussian profile .",
    "there is no reason to attribute the @xmath25610 dib to c@xmath1 , and no evidence for any astronomical feature resembling the @xmath5 band of c@xmath1 .",
    "figure [ band210 ] shows the region where the @xmath6 band of c@xmath1  is expected , as well as the @xmath26270 dib ( which has been suggested to correspond to the origin band ) . in this figure ,",
    "the spectra have been shifted in wavelength in order to co - align the si iii stellar line at 5740  .",
    "it is easily seen from the figure that with this wavelength shift , the feature at 5747   is also aligned , whereas the diffuse interstellar band @xmath26270 is no longer aligned .",
    "this implies that the feature which @xcite claim as a `` certain '' dib at 5748   is , in fact , a stellar line .",
    "this is particularly clear from the strength of the feature in the unreddened star hd 91316 ( @xmath16 leo ) which shows no trace of the @xmath26270 dib .",
    "since `` @xmath25748 '' is not of interstellar origin , it can not be assigned to c@xmath1 .",
    "figure [ band310 ] examines the case of the @xmath7 band of c@xmath1 , compared with the @xmath26065 dib .",
    "here we see that there is again a pronounced wavelength discrepancy @xmath17 1   between c@xmath1  and the dib . once again , there is no evidence to support assigning @xmath26065 to c@xmath1 .",
    "[ it is interesting to note that in our present sample of stars , @xmath26065 and @xmath26270 appear to be correlated in intensity .",
    "thus , while these bands are probably not due to c@xmath1 , they may share a common or closely ( chemically ) related carrier . ]",
    "the combination band @xmath8 is surprisingly strong in the laboratory spectrum of @xcite , and it was suggested that this band may correspond to the @xmath24964 dib . since the @xmath8 band was not revisited in the experiment of @xcite , we can not examine in detail its agreement with the @xmath24964 dib . however , with our substantially larger sample of stars , we are in a position to re - examine the correlation between the intensities of @xmath24964 and @xmath26270 ( supposedly the origin band of c@xmath1 ) .",
    "if these two bands are due to the same species , they must have the same intensity ratio from star to star , as this ratio is determined solely by the franck - condon factors .",
    "figure [ band120310 ] displays the spectra of @xmath24964 and @xmath26270 in a sample of twelve reddened stars . while it appeared in our original work @xcite that these bands were correlated , this was apparently due to the small sample ( 4 ) of stars considered in that work . from this figure",
    "it is evident that in some stars ( e.g.  hd 183143 and hd 20041 ) @xmath26270 is much stronger than @xmath24964 , while in other stars ( e.g.  hd 147888 and hd 147889 ) the situation is reversed .",
    "this clearly rules out the possibility that both bands can be due to the same carrier , and therefore they can not both be due to c@xmath1 .",
    "there are two other weak vibronic bands of the @xmath18 transition of c@xmath1  that were reported by @xcite .",
    "these both happen to be doublets : @xmath19 at 5089.5 and 5095.7  , and @xmath20 at 5449.6 and 5456.7  .",
    "we were not able to detect these bands in our astronomical spectra , but because of the intrinsic weakness of these bands ( compared with the origin band ) we were not able to set useful upper limits on them either .",
    "similarly , we were not able to obtain a useful limit for the origin band of the @xmath21 band , which has a very small central depth due to its intrinsic broadness .",
    "the hypothesis that c@xmath1  is a diffuse interstellar band carrier has been very attractive on spectroscopic grounds alone  no previously proposed carrier has come so close to providing a wavelength match to any set of the diffuse bands .",
    "there are strong chemical arguments against this hypothesis : chemical models @xcite are unable to reproduce the necessary abundance of c@xmath1 , even with the most favorable assumptions .",
    "this is due in large part to the destruction of c@xmath1by hydrogen atoms , which has been recently confirmed to proceed with a fast rate coefficient @xcite . in spite of these chemical arguments ,",
    "the approximate coincidence between the c@xmath1  and dib wavelengths has been too close to ignore , given the uncertainties inherent in the previously available laboratory and astronomical work .",
    "armed with the spectroscopic constants of c@xmath1  from @xcite and our improved sample of dib observations , however , it is now clear that c@xmath1fails the stringent tests enabled by high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the origin band does not match @xmath26270 in wavelength or profile , and there is no sign of the higher - lying @xmath15=3/2 component .",
    "the @xmath5 band is way off in wavelength from @xmath25610 ( @xmath0 2  ) and also does not agree with the profile of the dib .",
    "the dib attributed to the @xmath6 band turns out to be a stellar line .",
    "the @xmath7 band does not match @xmath26065 in wavelength or profile . finally , the dibs attributed to the @xmath8 band ( @xmath24964 ) and the origin band ( @xmath26270 ) do not vary together in intensity , and therefore do not share a common carrier .",
    "the authors thank j.  p.  maier and his research group for providing their laboratory data in advance of publication . this work has made use of the nasa astrophysics data service , as well as the simbad database at the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg .",
