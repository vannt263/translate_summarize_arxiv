    "the lyapunov function analysis demonstrates that the destruction of the same coupling environment for the last generation siblings is the cause behind the suppression of the exact synchronization .",
    "another work involving delay have shown occurrence of lag synchronization@xcite , where all the nodes of a network show lag synchronization .",
    "our work presents to a new phenomenon by exhibiting that even though the whole system does not display the lag synchronization , the boundary nodes leads to the formation of lag synchronized clusters . to conclude the heterogeneity supports cordial behavior among different families as reflected from the clusters containing nodes originated from different families",
    "we have demonstrated that heterogeneity in delay leads to the phase synchronized clusters consisting of the nodes from the different generations and lag synchronized clusters comprising of the nodes from last generation for cayley tree networks .",
    "the results presented here have been related with the family business and have been discussed in the context of genetic diseases , however , the framework presented here needs to incorporate a more realistic interaction as well as evolution pattern in order to represent these systems @xcite .",
