    "when very high energy particles travel through a quark - gluon or electromagnetic plasma , the dominant energy loss mechanism is through hard bremsstrahlung or pair creation , similar to the cascading of high energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere or of a high energy particle in a calorimeter .",
    "it was long a problem of interest to calculate the rate for such splitting processes in the formal limit of very high temperature quark - gluon plasmas , where the running strong coupling @xmath6 can be treated as small @xcite .",
    "the problem is complicated by the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite ( reviewed below ) : for very high energy particles , the quantum mechanical duration of the splitting process exceeds the mean free time between collisions , and so successive collisions can not be treated independently .    for the case of approximately on - shell massless particles traveling through an infinite medium , a complete leading - order analysis of such processes was carried out by jeon and moore @xcite using the formalism of arnold , moore , and yaffe ( amy ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis requires substantial numerical work to solve integral equations describing the lpm effect . where possible , it s always nice to have analytic results in place of numerical results , because they are simpler to calculate and because they can facilitate comparison between different approaches .",
    "one case where analytic results can be found , explored in earlier literature , is the limit where the particle momentum @xmath7 is so large compared to the plasma temperature @xmath8 that the inverse logarithm @xmath9 can be treated as a small number .",
    "we will refer to this as the deep lpm regime . in the limit of small @xmath0",
    ", earlier authors have given analytic results for splitting processes to leading order in powers of this inverse logarithm .",
    "( in contrast , the work of jeon and moore made no assumption about the size of the logarithm , and holds both in and out of the deep lpm limit , to leading order in coupling @xmath0 . )",
    "the difficulty with leading - log results is that for practical purposes there is a huge difference , for example , between @xmath10 and @xmath11 if @xmath7 is of order 10100 @xmath8 . but a leading - log analysis will not distinguish between these two situations since @xmath12 .",
    "consider , for example , 520 gev jets at early times in a rhic collision , with temperatures of order 300 mev . as a general rule , one almost always needs to push expansions in inverse logarithms to next - to - leading - log order to get useful results .",
    "our goal is to find analytic results for splitting processes to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) order in the deep lpm regime . in this paper",
    ", we make a first step towards that goal by computing the next - to - leading logarithmic result in the formal parametric limit that @xmath13 $ ] for weak coupling : that is , deep in the lpm regime , but not too deep .",
    "we will leave the more involved calculation of nll results for higher energy particles @xmath14 $ ] for future work .",
    "however , later in this paper ( section [ sec : largea ] ) , we will see that nll results for higher - energy particles will differ by only about 15% from the formulas derived here . in this paper we will also discuss leading - log results in the case of extremely high energy particles , where @xmath15 is so large that there is significant difference between the running couplings @xmath16 and @xmath6 .    as we will discuss later ,",
    "our results apply not just to equilibrium plasmas but more generally to plasmas with an isotropic distribution of particle momenta ( in which case the `` @xmath8 '' in our discussion refers to the typical energy scale of plasma particles ) .",

    "it does not mean a sum of leading logarithms at all orders in @xmath0 .",
    "the phrase next - to - leading logarithm will be used similarly , and does not include any resummation of effects higher order in @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , our nll results will formally assume that @xmath43 is parametrically large but that @xmath44 is parametrically small .",
    "in section [ sec : run ] , we discuss what to do when @xmath44 is not small .",
    "this is equivalent to a discussion of what renormalization scale should be used when evaluating @xmath0 . in this section",
    ", we necessarily abandon the @xmath40 $ ] restriction , considering much higher momentum scales , but we will only work to leading log order .",
    "before presenting our next - to - leading - log results , it is useful to first qualitatively review the form of leading - log results . for definiteness , we ll consider the case of gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "splitting can occur when nearly collinear bremsstrahlung accompanies a small - angle scattering of the high energy particle off of a plasma particle , such as depicted by the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] for a momentum @xmath15 particle splitting into two particles of momentum @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the intermediate solid line in this diagram is off - shell in energy by an amount of order @xmath47 for simplicity , in this review section we ll focus on the case @xmath48 ( that is , neither @xmath22 nor @xmath49 very small ) . in a typical bremsstrahlung process , the relative angle between @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the same order of magnitude as the angle of deflection in the initiating small - angle scattering process . for larger angles between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ,",
    "there is a cancellation between the amplitudes for initial and final state radiation . in vacuum",
    ", bremsstrahlung can be logarithmically dominated by smaller angles between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , giving rise to a collinear logarithmic enhancement of the bremsstrahlung rate .",
    "this is nor relevant to the deep lpm limit , however , for reasons that will be reviewed in footnote [ foot : logs ] .",
    "] for @xmath48 , then @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the size of the momentum transfer ( transverse to the high energy particle s direction of motion ) in the underlying scattering process .",
    "thermal particle masses are of order @xmath54 , and the relevant range of @xmath53 is bounded below by the debye screening mass of order @xmath54 .",
    "so we can simplify the parametric estimate ( [ eq : deltae1 ] ) to @xmath55 the quantum duration @xmath56 of the bremsstrahlung process is called the `` formation '' time of the bremsstrahlung gluon : @xmath57 in the limit of large @xmath15 , this time will become larger than the mean free time between collisions , and successive collisions can no longer be treated as quantum mechanically independent for the calculation of bremsstrahlung . as far as bremsstrahlung",
    "is concerned , the multiple collisions during the formation time have roughly the same effect as a single collision with the same total momentum transfer @xmath53 as the multiple collisions .",
    "so , on the one hand , the formation time is given by ( [ eq : tform ] ) . on the other hand , it is also the time @xmath58 for multiple collisions to generate a total momentum transfer of size @xmath53 , which is given by . for a more serious discussion in the deep lpm regime ,",

    "self - consistently equating ( [ eq : tform ] ) and ( [ eq : tcoll ] ) , @xmath67 this determines the total @xmath53 and thence @xmath68 and @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we want the rate for bremsstrahlung .",
    "every time increment @xmath58 , we produce effectively one net collision from the point of view of a potential bremsstrahlung gluon .",
    "the cost of adding a gluon emission to a scattering process is parametrically a factor for bremsstrahlung from a single collision in vacuum , there is also generally both an infrared logarithmic enhancement , associated with integrating over small @xmath22 , and a collinear logarithmic enhancement , previously mentioned in footnote [ foot : angles ] .",
    "the infrared behavior need not be considered here because we are restricting attention to @xmath48 in this qualitative discussion .",
    "( note also that the discussion of the infrared in medium would be different from the vacuum case because of the final state factor @xmath69 for the bremsstrahlung particle . )",
    "the collinear logarithm in the vacuum case depends on the initial and final state particles traveling in straight lines for sufficiently long distances before and after the collision .",
    "it does not arise in the lpm regime because @xmath70 . in any case",

    "first ignore the logarithm and define @xmath81 by the corresponding solution @xmath82 plugging this into the right - hand side of ( [ eq : qt ] ) gives an improved solution @xmath83 so @xmath84 and the splitting function ( [ eq : gammatilde ] ) is @xmath85 the inverse logarithm expansion is predicated on the assumption that the logarithm in ( [ eq : qperp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : qperp2 ] ) is large .",
    "as an example , supposed we plug the approximation ( [ eq : qperp1 ] ) back into the right - hand side of ( [ eq : qt ] ) to get a new approximation for @xmath80 : @xmath86 \\nonumber\\\\     & = \\left(\\frac{p}{t}\\right)^{1/2 }        \\left [ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{t}\\right )         + \\ln \\ln ( \\qto^2 ) \\right]^{1/2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit that @xmath87 , then @xmath43 is also large compared to @xmath88 .",
    "so we may formally choose to think of the double - log correction as part of the next - to - leading order terms in the expansion in inverse logs .",
    "as we ll discussion in section [ sec : eqs ] , the nll calculation will be much simpler if the momentum transfers in individual scattering events can be treated as a small perturbation to typical particles in the plasmas .",
    "the relevant transverse momentum transfers @xmath90 of individual collisions range from order @xmath77 to order @xmath91 , which gives rise to the coulomb logarithm in ( [ eq : tcoll ] ) .",
    "so the simplifying assumption that @xmath92 is equivalent to @xmath93 in our analysis .",
