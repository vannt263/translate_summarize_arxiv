    "einstein s general theory of relativity describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of matter .",
    "most massive physical objects like black holes distort the geometry of spacetime by their immense gravity . the accretion disk around a rotating black hole ( most physical in nature ) is always filled with charged plasma due to the pair production in this region .",
    "this charged plasma creates an external magnetic field around the black hole ( the region containing this field is termed as magnetosphere in literature ) and is governed by the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical ( grmhd ) equations .",
    "the intrinsic angular momentum of the black hole intends the surrounding plasma to act as a magneto - rotational fluid .",
    "the black hole spin modifies the rotation of the plasma which flows in the form of an mhd wind .",

    "these waves propagate to transmit information in the magnetosphere .",

    "the most general line element in 3 + 1 formalism can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lapse function , @xmath3 are the components of shift vector and @xmath4 are the components of spatial metric .",
    "all these quantities are functions of time and space coordinates .",
    "we consider the planar analogue of the kerr metric @xcite @xmath5 the directions @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath7 are the analogue of the kerr s radial @xmath8 , axial @xmath9 and poloidal @xmath10 directions respectively whereas @xmath11 represents the time coordinate .",
    "utilizing coordinate freedom , the lapse function is set to unity without loss of generality .",
    "this has been done to avoid complications which arise due to the presence of horizon and hence , the red - shifts .",
    "the rotation of the black hole imposes a shift vector which is obvious from eq.([st2 ] ) .",
    "the value of the shift function @xmath12 ( analogue to the kerr - type gravitomagnetic potential ) decreases monotonically from @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) to some constant value ( @xmath15 ) . equation ( [ st2 ] ) shows that our assumed @xmath12 is @xmath16 which derives an mhd wind and extract translational energy analogous to the rotational energy of the kerr metric .",
    "the plasma particles , created at @xmath17 ( pair production region ) , are then driven up to relativistic velocities by magnetic - gravitomagnetic coupling , as they flow off to `` infinity '' @xmath18 and down towards the `` event horizon '' @xmath19 .",
    "our scenario is based on the pair production region and its surrounding plasma .",
    "thus we are interested in the magnetospheric plasmas rotating in the 2-d fashion i.e. in ( @xmath20-plane ) .",
    "the shift is restricted to be dependent on only one dimension .",
    "it may depend on the other dimensions which obviously make the analysis tough but more general .",
    "the shift is the effect of black hole rotation , of course .",
    "the plasma is being produced in the pair production region ( electron - positron pair production holds and at @xmath17 in our scenario ) outflows from the region towards the event horizon which lies at @xmath21 and towards the outer end of the magnetosphere ( the end away from the event horizon ) .",
    "the plasma produced in the pair production region falls out from the region .",
    "this outflow disturbs the neighboring magnetospheric plasma in the form of waves .",
    "the region @xmath17 is not a physical singularity but the region where particle - antiparticle pairs are produced from the vacuum energy .",
    "since the out flowing plasma is moving in the @xmath22-plane , so it will absolutely disturb the outer plasma in the same plane .",
    "this spacetime requires a fiducial reference observer ( fido ) ( analogous to the zero angular momentum observer of the 3 + 1 split of the kerr spacetime ) , the one with four - velocity perpendicular to the hypersurfaces of constant time @xmath11 .",
    "the geometrized units will be used throughout the paper .",
    "we consider a rotating background which is assumed to be filled with cold plasma admitting the following equation @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the specific enthalpy , rest and moving mass densities of the fluid respectively .",
    "this shows that the plasma has vanishing thermal pressure and thermal energy .",
    "thus the cold plasma particles are moving along timelike geodesics of the spacetime ( [ st2 ] ) .    the rotating fluid s four - velocity and magnetic field measured by our fido",
    "can be described by spatial vector fields lying in @xmath22-plane @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant .    for the stationary symmetric background , the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath6 components of the velocity vector for the spacetime ( [ st2 ] )",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the normalized shift and @xmath30 is an integration constant .",
    "further , the mass conservation law in three - dimensional hypersurface is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lorentz factor .",
    "we take the assumptions @xmath33 for simplifications .",
    "it is important to note that our assumed @xmath12 is continuous across @xmath17 ( i.e. , the pair production region ) .",
    "this shift may not be valid for the near horizon .",
    "the expansion of shift vector @xmath12 implies that this vector is directly proportional to the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath34 of the black hole and inversely proportional to the radius of the black hole .",
    "thus the spin of the black hole can be expressed by the following relation @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 this @xmath12 is involved in all the dispersion relations . as the function",
    "@xmath12 changes , the value of the dispersion relation ( i.e. , the relationship between the wave number and angular frequency ) changes . in this work ,",
    "we consider only the propagation which changes due to change in @xmath6 and hence the change in @xmath12 .    according to these assumptions ,",
    "the mhd flow is intended to model a wind flowing out of the ergosphere of a kerr black hole and also an accretion flow down to the horizon , both originated at the pair production region , i.e. , @xmath37 at the pair production region , @xmath38 the renormalized shift vector is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a flow constant .",
    "there is no flow at @xmath41 thus @xmath42 at @xmath37    our assumed plasma s magnetic field having a variable @xmath0-component @xmath43 with variable @xmath44 depends on the variable @xmath6 .",
    "the plasma is frozen - in to the @xmath27-field and we have assumed an adiabatic flow . for simplification , we have also taken @xmath45 i.e. , the @xmath0-component of the magnetic field becomes constant and leads to a constant unperturbed magnetic field .",
    "when we apply these values to eq.([xz ] ) and then substitute the resulting value of @xmath46 in eq.([clm ] ) with the simplification @xmath47 ( as done in @xcite-@xcite ) , we obtain the following pairs of velocity components .",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding poynting vector , then , takes the form @xmath50 these assumptions lead to a rotating black hole magnetospheric fluid which admits a constant external magnetic field .",
    "the fluid is moving with a velocity @xmath51 in the magnetosphere .",
    "the gravitomagnetic waves and pair of particles are produced in the @xmath17 region .",
    "the energy extraction from the black hole is possible if the medium allows the waves and particles to pass through it and move out of the magnetosphere .",
    "the gravitomagnetic waves transform information within plasma .",
    "if the medium , in the region under consideration , allows the waves to move normally , these waves can get out of the magnetosphere .",
    "this can be well understood by investigating properties of the waves in this region .",
    "the plasma flow in the magnetosphere is perturbed due to gravity and rotation of the black hole .",
    "this flow is characterized by fluid s density @xmath25 , velocity @xmath51 and magnetic field @xmath52 .",
    "the linear perturbations will be in @xmath22-plane and thus are dependent on @xmath53 and @xmath11 .",
    "the perturbed variables take the following form @xmath54 where unperturbed quantities are denoted by the superscript zero .",
    "further , the dimensionless notations @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be expressed as @xmath57    the perturbations are assumed to be harmonic , i.e. , of the form @xmath58 ( having sinusoidal dependence on @xmath59 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath60 where @xmath61 are arbitrary constants , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the @xmath0 and @xmath6-components of the wave vector @xmath64 and @xmath65 is angular frequency of the wave .",
    "the perfect grmhd equations for the kerr planar analogue ( eq.([st2 ] ) ) is given by eqs.(2.4)-(2.8 ) of @xcite .",
    "substituting the value of rest - mass density from eq.(3.1 ) , we obtain their specific form for the cold plasma . the insertion of perturbed values from eq.([pv ] ) and then from eq.([p ] ) give the component form of these equations .",
    "this is the same procedure as given in @xcite and @xcite .    since the perturbed variables have harmonic dependence on @xmath53 and @xmath11 , hence eq.([ps ] )",

    "this assumption will make the set of equations easier to solve .",
    "the relaxation in this assumption may change the regions of normal and anomalous dispersion .",
    "when we solve the determinant of the coefficients of eqs.(4.1 ) , ( [ d4 ] ) , ( [ e4])-([b4 ] ) of constants ( @xmath61 ) for the @xmath0-component of the wave vector , it gives a complex dispersion relation of the form : @xmath74 this relation is quintic in @xmath62 and can not give exact solutions .",
    "thus , we solve it numerically by using _ mathematica _",
    ", for the complex values of @xmath62 .",
    "the assumption @xmath71 implies that @xmath63 is also a complex number .",
    "thus the quantities given by eq.([ps ] ) take the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the values @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent the @xmath0 and @xmath6-components of the propagation factor from which we can obtain the @xmath0 and @xmath6-components of the phase and group velocities whereas @xmath80 and @xmath81 represent the @xmath0 and @xmath6-components of the attenuation factor .",
    "we have considered the region @xmath82 to analyze the wave properties of the cold plasma .",
    "the cold flow assumption indicates that the fluid has no viscosity and no heat conduction .",
    "this is indeed an ideal case but provides basis for the case of hot plasma , thus has its own importance .",
    "perturbations themselves modify this assumption because we include the perturbations in the grmhd equations for cold plasma .",
    "since the flow variables @xmath83 have more variations near the pair production region , thus we have excluded the region @xmath84 and solved the relation for rest of the region where these variables have small variation .",
    "thus the region under consideration @xmath82 is divided into two regions @xmath85 and @xmath86 for which roots are numerically interpolated .",
    "the region @xmath87 indicates the neighborhood of the pair production region towards the event horizon and the region @xmath86 shows the neighborhood of the pair production region towards the outer end of the magnetosphere .",
    "we take the step - length @xmath88 for @xmath6 and @xmath65 and find the value of @xmath62 at each point @xmath89 of the mesh . then by separating each root",
    ", we estimate the surface by numerical interpolation .",
    "the @xmath0-components of the propagation vector , attenuation vector , phase and group velocities can be evaluated from these interpolation functions .",
    "we have obtained two velocities ( given by eqs.([u1 ] ) and ( [ u2 ] ) ) for our assumed plasma ( i.e. , rotating cold plasma with constant rest - mass density ) . for each velocity , eq.([dr ] ) leads to five values of the @xmath0-component of the wave numbers .",
    "we display @xmath0-components of the propagation vector , attenuation vector , phase and group velocities and analyze the dispersion with respect to these quantities .    for the region towards the black hole horizon with the fluid flow velocity given by eq.([u1 ] ) , we obtain one root for which the wave number is infinite at several values of @xmath6 . such a root is also found for the region towards the outer end of the magnetosphere ( @xmath90 ) for the velocity components ( eq.([u2 ] ) ) .",
    "these roots indicate that the waves are evanescent there which decreases with the passage of time .",
    "thus the energy can not pass through the region via waves and hence these cases are not interesting .",
    "for the velocity components ( [ u1 ] ) , the dispersion relations obtained in the region towards the event horizon in the neighborhood of the pair production region are given by figures 1 - 4 .",
    "figures 6 - 9 indicate the dispersion relations for the region towards the outer end of the magnetosphere .",
    "the dispersion relations related to the velocity components ( [ u2 ] ) for the region towards the event horizon are given by figures 10 - 14 .",
    "for the region towards the outer end of the magnetosphere , these relations are shown by figures 15 - 18 .    in figures 1 - 4 and 10 - 14",
    ", the positive propagation factor shows that the waves are moving towards the pair production region whereas the negative propagation factor indicates that the waves are moving towards the event horizon .",
    "we see from figures 6 - 9 and 15 - 18 that when the propagation factor is positive , the waves are moving towards the outer end of the magnetosphere whereas the negative propagation factor indicates that the waves are moving towards the pair production region",
    ". table 1 indicates the regions of magnetosphere with the directed waves .",
    "the rest of the region contains random points of positive and negative propagation factor and thus the direction of waves changes at each point .",
    "if the attenuation factor is increasing , it leads to the damping of waves whereas if this factor decreases , it indicates wave growth .",
    "table 2 shows the damping and growth of waves .",
    "the up - arrow in the table shows the increase whereas the down - arrow shows the decrease in respective quantity .",
    "the attenuation factor takes random values otherwise .    in a region where the phase velocity is greater than the group velocity ,",
    "the waves are dispersed normally @xcite-@xcite whereas the group velocity greater than the phase velocity shows that the waves disperse anomalously .",
