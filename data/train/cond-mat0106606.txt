    "the excess magnetization , and the observed cooling rate dependence of the magnetization at low temperatures in ncmo are instead related to the establishment of the long range afm state , possibly via the large increase in orthorhombic distortion@xcite and @xmath13-axis contraction@xcite occurring between @xmath2 and @xmath3 upon cooling .",

    "[ fig4](b ) , the relaxation curves obtained for experiments * a * and * b * are nearly identical , showing again that the cooling rate at all temperatures below @xmath3 is the key parameter of our effect . as observed earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the relaxation diminishes when the effective cooling slows down , from experiments * a*,*b * to experiment * d*. the relaxation at @xmath41 reflects the evolution of the domain configuration of the afm state .",

    "recent x - ray scattering results@xcite also indicate a partial orbital ordering of the low temperature phase , leading to an orbital domain state .",
    "the here observed cooling rate dependence of @xmath14 below @xmath3 could thus be related to the intrinsic inhomogeneities of the ce - type structure , and the nucleation or rearrangement of orbital domains and domain walls to accommodate the large contraction of the structure occurring upon cooling .",
    "the cooling rate determines the time allowed to the system to accomodate the structural modifications governed by the temperature . in a similar way",
