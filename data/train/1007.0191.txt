    "as originally proposed by kaluza and klein @xcite , an extra - dimensional space - time may be compactified to leave the 4-dimensional space - time as our real world .",
    "it was later demonstrated that the fundamental mass scale of the compactified space may be much smaller than the planck mass @xcite .",
    "this stimulated intense studies of phenomenological evidences of extra - dimensional effects @xcite.thus in the analysis of @xcite , bulk fermions were introduced in the 5d space - time interacting with fermions living on a 3-brane .",
    "the interaction between fermions generated as a result of the exchange of the kaluza - klein excited modes of the graviton may be expressed as effective four - fermion interaction @xcite that may lead to the dynamical generation of fermion masses @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there exists also the idea that the higgs particle may originate from extra - dimensional components of gauge fields @xcite . in this way",
    ", a yukawa coupling to the 4d scalar , @xmath0 , of the same strength as the gauge coupling , the so - called gauge - yukawa unification , may also lead to a mass generation .",
    "a non - zero expectation value of @xmath0 then necessarily breaks the gauge and chiral symmetries of the underlying theory and @xmath0 thus plays the role of the higgs field .",
    "this is a sort of radiative symmetry breaking @xcite , or hosotani mechanism @xcite .",
    "thus , it is the dynamical symmetry breaking by the four - fermion interaction which together with this higgs - type mechanism generate the physical fermion mass spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider an extension of the fermion model @xcite describing the interaction of bulk fermions with fermions on a 3-brane in 5d space - time with one extra dimension compactified on a circle of radius @xmath1 , by assuming the additional presence of a constant abelian gauge field component @xmath0 in the bulk .",
    "in particular , we will study chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation for light fermions under the combined influence of the effective four - fermion interactions and the bulk field component @xmath0 ( in the following denoted as gauge field ) .",
    "for this aim , we first derive the effective potential @xmath2 as function of the scalar ( fermion condensate ) field @xmath3 and the constant field @xmath0 for the case of both periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions of the bulk fermion field .",
    "the mean field values of these fields are then determined from the corresponding gap equations . on this basis",
    "the critical coupling constants @xmath4 for the chiral phase transition and the fermion condensate are numerically calculated and presented as functions of the compactification radius @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we discuss the resulting fermion mass spectrum obtained from solving the corresponding eigenvalue equation for ground state and excited kaluza - klein states of fermions .",
    "two mechanisms of fermion mass generation are known : the dynamically generation of fermion masses and the kaluza - klein mechanism for generating masses of excited modes of the bulk fermions due to compactification .",
    "the mass of eventually existing kaluza - klein excited modes is expected to be of the order of tev @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall consider a 5d fermion model containing two types of fermion fields and a bulk gauge field @xmath5 .",
    "one of the fermions , @xmath6 , lives in the 5-dimensional bulk space , while the other one , @xmath7 , exists only on a 3-brane which resides at a fixed point of the extra dimension .",
    "the interaction between these fermions is assumed to be given by a four - fermion term .",
    "let us further suppose that the bulk fermion @xmath6 is charged and thus may interact with the bulk abelian gauge field @xmath5 , whereas the fermion @xmath7 is neutral .",
    "let us consider the vacuum averages @xmath8 , while @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of the constant potential @xmath10 then influences the dynamical mass generation arising from the four - fermion interaction .",
    "moreover , for applying the @xmath11 expansion technique , fermions are assumed to be multiplets of a flavour @xmath12 group and thus to have @xmath13 flavour components .",
    "the model is described by a straightforward extension of the lagrangian studied in @xcite : @xmath14\\delta(y),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the covariant derivative with @xmath5 being a bulk abelian gauge field .- type matrix anticommuting with all other @xmath18 matrices like in 4 dimensions and thus no standard chiral symmetry .",
    "an irreducible representation of a 5-dimensional fermion field is given by a 4-component field as in the case of 4 dimensions , and the fifth component of the @xmath18 matrix is just @xmath19 in 4 dimensions .",
    "] the fifth coordinate @xmath20 varies in the interval @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "clearly , in the absence of the gauge field @xmath22 the lagrangian is invariant under the @xmath23 discrete `` chiral '' symmetry : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the discrete symmetry thus prevents a mass term of the form @xmath27 . to preserve this symmetry ,",
    "the field @xmath22 should transform as @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "therefore the presence of the constant potential @xmath0 spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "in particular it is interesting to consider the influence of a constant @xmath0 on the dynamical mass generation of fermions .    as usually done in the case of njl - type models ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , we next introduce an auxiliary ( flavour - singlet ) boson field @xmath30 to obtain a linearized version of the above model lagrangian @xmath31\\delta(y),\\ ] ] where summation over dirac and flavour indices is implicitly included . in the following",
    "we shall consider the dynamical mass generation in the mean field approximation supposing that only the flavor - singlet field @xmath32 acquires a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath33 , whereas all the other irrelevant components of @xmath30 vanish , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "after performing the chiral rotation @xmath36 and @xmath37 one obtains @xmath38\\delta(y).\\ ] ]    since the coordinate @xmath20 varies on the circle , the end points @xmath39 and @xmath40 must be identified .",
    "we adopt the general boundary condition for the fifth coordinate @xmath41 where the phase @xmath42 may have an arbitrary value in the range @xmath43 .",
    "( note that a change of the phase of the @xmath6-field does not affect the phase of the condensate @xmath3 which exists only at @xmath39 . ) in particular , @xmath44 corresponds to a periodic boundary condition and @xmath45 to an antiperiodic one .",
    "then we obtain the decomposition of the bulk fermion field into the kaluza - klein modes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a normalization constant .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) is invariant under the usual `` small '' gauge transformations @xmath48 with periodic function @xmath49 : @xmath50 .",
    "in addition there are also `` large '' gauge transformations which satisfy the condition @xmath51 so that the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) for the transformed field @xmath6 is not violated",
    ". in particular , if we take @xmath52 , then the transformation of gauge fields yields : @xmath53 thus , an _ arbitrary _ constant potential @xmath0 can not be gauged away when the fifth coordinate is compactified .",
    "integration over the coordinate @xmath20 yields the effective four - dimensional lagrangian @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "to obtain the properly normalized kinetic term , we chose @xmath57 .",
    "let us next introduce matrix notations for the fermion fields @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) @xcite @xmath60 and for the mass matrix @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the unit operator in flavor space and @xmath63 then the effective lagrangian can be written in the compact matrix form as follows @xmath64 it should be noted that the fermions represented by @xmath65 can not be observed by themselves . only the eigenstates of the mass matrix @xmath66 are observable fermions .",
    "supposing that @xmath32 acquires a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath33 , we expect that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath66 with @xmath67 determine the masses of 4-dimensional fermions .",
    "they can be found in the following way .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath68 now we make use of the following identity @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the algebraic supplement of @xmath71 . as a result , we have @xmath72 \\left\\ { \\lambda(\\lambda+a-\\frac{\\delta}{2r } ) -|m|^2 -2    \\sum_{l=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(\\lambda+a-\\frac{\\delta}{2r})^2-\\left(\\frac{l}{r}\\right)^2 } \\right\\}.\\ ] ] the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath66 can then be obtained from the equation @xmath73 finally , by using the summation formula @xmath74 one can rewrite the eigenvalue equation as @xmath75 \\left\\ { \\lambda(\\lambda+a-\\frac{\\delta}{2r } ) - |m|^2[\\pi r ( \\lambda+a)-\\frac{\\pi\\delta}{2}]\\cot[\\pi r(\\lambda+a)-\\frac{\\pi \\delta}{2 } ] \\right\\}=0.\\ ] ] it is easy to verify that @xmath76-values satisfying @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) are not eigenvalues , since they are canceled by simple poles of the cotangent function in the curly brackets .",

    "it is seen that at @xmath105 the critical curve starts from zero at @xmath124 and therefore even if the coupling is fixed in such a way that it is less than the asymptotic value ( [ cc ] ) the dynamical mass can still be nonzero for small radius ( @xmath125 ) ( if @xmath126 the fermion mass exists at all radii of extra dimension ) . for @xmath127",

    "we simply obtain @xmath128 we are interested here in a light fermion with mass @xmath129 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the lowest kaluza - klein mode in this case has the mass @xmath130 .",

    "if @xmath0 is considered as a background parameter , then for sufficiently large radii the dynamical mass becomes independent of the gauge field and approaches its value corresponding to a vanishing gauge potential .",
    "moreover , the dynamical mass is an oscillating function of the field component @xmath0 with an amplitude of oscillations that decreases with growing radius @xmath1 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the gauge potential as a dynamical variable , then it may acquire trivial or nontrivial values depending on the choice of the coupling constant @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that for a vanishing gauge field and a coupling constant close to its critical value , it is possible to obtain a light fermion mode whose mass is lower than the inverse radius , which is in correspondence with the results of @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath0 acquires a nonvanishing value , then the lowest fermion mode is massless independently of the dynamical mass @xmath102 .",
    "other possible modes have masses @xmath145 , and higher kaluza - klein modes have even higher masses @xmath146 .",
    "the investigated interplay of the influence of kaluza - klein fermions and bulk gauge fields on the generation of dynamical masses of fermions living on a brane seems to us conceptually interesting and worth to be generalized to other , phenomenologically more realistic models .",
