    "there are three known classes of pulsating white dwarf stars in three different instability strips : the pulsating pg 1159 stars at about 100,000 k , the dbv ( he i spectrum , variable ) stars at 25,000 k , and the dav ( h ) stars at 12,000 k. in spite of the differences in temperature and surface composition , the pulsation periods and the appearance of the lightcurves are similar . the dav and dbv stars in particular ( with periods between 100 and 1000 seconds ) , have distinctive non - sinusoidal variations at large amplitude , and more linear behavior at small amplitude @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the fourier transforms of dav and dbv lightcurves generally show power at harmonics and at sum and difference frequencies .",
    "these `` combination frequencies '' are not in general the result of independent pulsation eigenmodes , but rather of frequency mixing between eigenmodes @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will explore combination frequencies in the small amplitude dav ( zz ceti ) white dwarf stars .",
    "the combination frequency peaks are smaller , and therefore harder to detect , than the combination frequencies in large amplitude pulsators like g29 - 38 , but they are more stable , and therefore more likely to yield understandable and repeatable results .",
    "the small amplitude davs are also the pulsators in which the origin of the combination frequencies are most uncertain  they might arise from convective effects @xcite or from nonlinearities in the radiative flux alone , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic measurements of @xcite showed that the zz ceti stars lie within a narrow range of effective temperatures , and @xcite   reasoned that most , if not all , da white dwarfs are variables as they cool through this instability strip .",
    "the low amplitude pulsators we consider in this paper lie at the high temperature end of the instability strip , and have short , stable pulsation periods @xcite .",
    "the variations we observe arise from the temperature changes associated with non - radial gravity - mode pulsations @xcite . at some amplitude",
    ", these pulsations will appear non - sinusoidal because of the @xmath3 dependence of the measured flux .",
    "the combination frequencies that we measure in the low amplitude dav white dwarfs discussed in this paper are larger than those expected from the @xmath3 nonlinearity , and require an additional nonlinear process in the surface layers of the white dwarf .    the first attempt to identify the nonlinear process was @xcite , who explored the time dependent properties of the surface convection zone . using a numerical model of the surface convection zone ,",
    "@xcite calculated the first non - sinusoidal theoretical shapes of zz ceti lightcurves . in his model",
    ", the nearly isentropic surface convection zone adjusts its entropy on short timescales , attenuating and delaying any flux changes that originate at its base . as the convection zone changes thickness during a single pulsation cycle , the amount of attenuation and delay changes as well , distorting sinusoidal input variations and creating combination frequencies in the fourier spectrum of the output signal .",
    "@xcite repeated and expanded brickhill s work using an analytic approach .",
    "* hereafter wu ) was able to derive approximate expressions for the size of combination frequencies that depend upon the frequency , amplitude , and spherical harmonic indices of the parent modes , and upon the inclination of the star s pulsation axis to our line of sight .",
    "her solutions yield physical insight into the problem , and make predictions for individual stars straightforward to calculate .",
    "wu herself compared her calculations to measured combination frequencies in the dbv gd 358 and the large - amplitude zz ceti , g29 - 38 , finding good correspondence .",
    "subsequently , @xcite extended the numerical simulations of lightcurves of @xcite , showing that for large amplitude pulsations ( @xmath4 ) the numerical models must incorporate the time - dependence of quantities that are held constant in the method of brickhill ( e.g. , heat capacities ) . in these full time - dependent calculations ,",
    "the large amplitude variations begin to show maxima in locations different from those described by the low - order spherical harmonics .",
    "however , for the small amplitude variations we consider in this paper , this effect is negligible , and the numerical results of @xcite are in agreement with @xcite and wu .    an entirely different model for explaining combination frequencies was proposed by ( * ?",
    "* hereafter bfw ) . instead of changes in the convection zone ,",
    "bfw invoke the nonlinear response of the radiative atmosphere , ignoring the changes to the surface convection zone .",
    "these radiative nonlinearities can be larger than expected from the @xmath3 dependence of flux because of the sensitivity of the h absorption lines to temperature .",
    "@xcite compared the predictions of this theory to those of brickhill for the large amplitude pulsator g29 - 38 , and found that the combination frequencies in that star are too large to be explained by the bfw theory .",
    "this does not necessarily invalidate the theory , but suggests that some other mechanism is at work , at least in g29 - 38 .",
    "@xcite left open the question of low amplitude pulsators , which have much smaller combination frequencies . in one case at least ( g117-b15a ) , the bfw theory was able to account for the amplitude of the combination frequencies @xcite .",
    "however , this success relied on an exact match between the spectroscopic temperature of the star and a narrow maximum in the theoretical predictions .",
    "using more recent spectroscopic temperature estimates for g117-b15a , which differ from the old by only 850 k ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the theory underestimates the combination frequency amplitudes by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "in general , even for the low amplitude pulsators , the bfw theory underestimates the sizes of combination frequencies by an order of magnitude or more .    in this paper",
    "we compare the analytic theory of wu to observations of the hot , low - amplitude zz ceti stars gd 66 , gd 244 , g117-b15a , g185 - 32 , l19 - 2 , gd 165 , r548 , and g226 - 29 , to determine how well this theory reproduces the combination frequencies in hot dav stars .",
    "if they correctly describe and predict the behavior of dav pulsations , the analytical formulae of wu will be an important tool for mode identification in zz ceti stars . confidently assigning values of the spherical degree ( @xmath0 ) and azimuthal order ( @xmath5 ) to individual eigenfrequencies",
    "has heretofore required time - resolved spectroscopy using either very large optical telescopes or the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "as @xcite first proposed , and bfw reiterated , a reliable theory for combination frequency amplitudes allows pulsation mode identification based on measurements of combination frequencies alone .",
    "thus , if we can verify that the predictions of wu are consistent with observations , then they constitute an uncomplicated method of mode identification that relies only upon broadband photometry rather than spectroscopy .",
    "moreover , the theory of goldreich & wu ( and of brickhill ) implicitly contains a mode driving mechanism different from that originally proposed for the dav stars .",
    "verification of the analytical predictions of wu will support this convective driving mechanism as the source of pulsations in dav stars .    for this paper , we have used published fourier spectra , new reductions of archival whole earth telescope data , and original data obtained with the mcdonald observatory 2.1-m struve telescope to measure combination frequency amplitudes or amplitude limits for eight hot dav stars .",
    "we have applied our best estimates of the inclination of the pulsation axis to the observer s line of sight and compared the amplitudes of the combination frequencies to the analytical calculations of wu .",
    "we find that the theory reproduces the relative amplitudes of combination frequencies in these stars very well , but over - predicts their absolute values by a factor of about 1.4 .",
    "the calculations of wu include an adjustable parameterization of the radiative atmosphere which can easily accommodate a factor this large .",
    "when we normalize its value using the star in our sample with the most detected combination frequencies , gd 66 , the theory reproduces all the observed ratios of combination frequency to parent mode amplitudes to better than a factor of two .",
    "this is easily sufficient to verify the high @xmath0 identification for modes in g185 - 32 , as established by @xcite using time - resolved spectroscopy from keck and the hubble space telescope .",
    "it is also sufficient in many cases to distinguish between @xmath2 and @xmath6 by relying on mode harmonics .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that the theory of wu , suitably calibrated , can function as a mode identification method for at least the hot zz ceti stars .",
    "this conclusion is important because the follow - up photometry of zz ceti candidates from the sloan digital sky survey is finding large numbers of these pulsators that will be too faint for practical time - resolved spectroscopic methods ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that time - series photometry on four - meter class telescopes , augmented with multiplet splitting where available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will be sufficient to classify modes in these stars .",
    "we begin in  [ theory ] by summarizing the analytical expressions of wu necessary for predicting the amplitudes of combination frequencies .",
    "we also discuss our method for estimating the inclination of the stars pulsation axes to the observer s line of sight , and show that our result is insensitive to error in this estimate . in  [ data ] we present the data for each of the eight stars individually and compare predictions based on wu s equations with the observed amplitudes . in ",
    "[ sum ] we summarize our results and discuss future application of the technique , emphasizing a prescription for applying the theory of wu to large samples of zz ceti stars .",
    "in this section , we will summarize wu s analytic model and explain how we apply her theory , along with an independent estimation of the stellar inclination angle , to predict the amplitudes of combination frequencies .",
    "wu s models rely upon an attenuation and a delay of the perturbed flux within the convection zone to produce non - sinusoidal photospheric flux variations .",
    "the differential equation describing these effects ( wu ) is :    @xmath7{{dx}\\over{dt}}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the assumed sinusoidal flux perturbation at the base of the convection zone .",
    "@xmath9 is the flux variation at the photosphere and is related to the photometric variations we observe .",
    "@xmath10 is the time delay introduced by the convection zone .",
    "physically it represents the timescale over which the convection zone can absorb a flux change ( by adjusting its entropy ) instead of communicating it to the surface . in this paper",
    "we approximate @xmath10 by setting it equal to the longest observed mode period .",
    "this is a lower limit , because modes with periods longer than @xmath10 can not be driven , but the longest observed period might not be quite as large as @xmath10 . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are fixed parameterizations of the radiative region overlying the convection zone , and represent an attenuation of the flux .",
    "the mixing length models of @xcite yield @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the temperature range of zz ceti stars ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "the solution to equation  [ diff ] represents the detectable flux variation at the photosphere , and has the assumed form :    @xmath15 + a_{i+j}\\cos[(\\omega_i+\\omega_j)t+\\psi_{i+j}]+ ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solving equation  [ diff ] yields expressions for the amplitude coefficients ( @xmath16 ) and the phases ( @xmath17 ) at each combination frequency ( @xmath18 ) . in this paper",
    "we do not consider phases because they are impossible to recover from some of the published data , and difficult to measure in the presence of noise .",
    "thus we focus on the amplitudes represented by :    @xmath19 ^ 2}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "these @xmath16 represent total flux amplitudes for the combination frequencies and are given in terms of the total flux amplitudes of the parent modes ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) . because we measure an integrated flux in a restricted wavelength range , these amplitudes are not analogous to the ones we measure .",
    "however , they can be transformed into quantities like those we measure by integrating over the appropriate spherical harmonic viewed at some inclination ( @xmath25 ) in the presence of an eddington limb - darkening law , and then applying a bolometric correction ( @xmath26 ) appropriate for the detector and filter combination .",
    "calculating the integrated amplitude requires an expression for the flux in the presence of limb darkening . for a parent mode , which is assumed to have the angular dependence of a spherical harmonic",
    ", wu gives :    @xmath27 \\left(1+{{3}\\over{2}}\\cos(\\theta)\\right)\\cos(\\theta)d\\cos(\\theta),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 are in the coordinate system defined by the observer s line of sight , and @xmath29 are aligned to the pulsation axis of the star .",
    "these two coordinate systems are separated by the angle @xmath25 , which is the inclination of the star .",
    "evaluating this integral requires estimating this inclination , and applying the appropriate coordinate transformation ( see appendix a of wu ) .    for the combination frequencies , the integrated flux depends on the product of the spherical harmonics of the parent modes :    @xmath30    where the @xmath31 are legendre polynomials , and the @xmath32 are the normalization factors for the parent mode spherical harmonics .",
    "our expression differs from that of wu slightly , in that we explicitly retain these normalization factors .",
    "the bolometric correction is simpler , since it is only a numeric factor expressing the ratio of the amplitudes measured by the detector to the bolometric variations given by the theory .",
    "we calculated this factor using model atmospheres of different temperatures provided by koester ( discussed in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observations we analyze in this paper are either white light measurement using a bi - alkali photocathode or ccd measurements with a red cutoff filter ( bg40 ) .",
    "we applied the known sensitivity curves of these systems and the uv cutoff of the earth s atmosphere to the model spectra and found bolometric corrections of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . because of the wavelength dependence of limb darkening these corrections depend upon the value of @xmath0 assumed for the modes , but this dependence is weak at optical wavelengths .",
    "our values are calculated assuming @xmath2 .",
    "they are so close to the value that wu used ( @xmath35 ) that we have decided to retain her value of @xmath35 to make our results directly comparable to hers .",
    "now we can write the observable flux change at the photosphere in terms of    @xmath36    @xmath37    so the predicted combination amplitude is :    @xmath38 ^ 2 } } } { { g_{\\ell_i~\\ell_j}^{m_i \\pm m_j}(\\theta_\\circ)}\\over { g_{\\ell_i}^{m_i}(\\theta_\\circ ) g_{\\ell_j}^{m_j}(\\theta_\\circ)}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equation  [ amplitude ] is the expression we use to calculate the predicted combination frequency amplitudes for various assumptions of @xmath0 and @xmath5 for the parent modes .",
    "we reiterate that the bolometric corrections of the two parent modes are really only equal if they are modes of the same @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the value for @xmath26 for the combination frequency amplitude in equation  [ comboamp ] will be a linear combination of the bolometric corrections of the two parent modes .",
    "consequently , the @xmath39 dependence of @xmath40 in equation  [ amplitude ] ( and of @xmath41 in equation  [ rc ] ) is only an approximation .",
    "in addition to @xmath26 , calculating a prediction for the combination frequency amplitudes requires six additional quantities , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the first two are the parent mode amplitude and frequency measured from the fourier transform .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are theoretical atmospheric parameters defined by wu , and @xmath10 is the convective timescale estimated from the longest period mode .",
    "the final quantity , @xmath25 , is the inclination , which we discuss later .",
    "physically , it is useful to rearrange equation  [ amplitude ] into the form :      the ratio @xmath41 is a dimensionless ratio between the combination frequency and the product of its parents , as introduced by @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to consider the two terms on the right hand side of equation  [ rc ] separately .",
    "the first term ( @xmath45 ) incorporates the physics particular to this model , i.e. , the thermal properties of the convection zone , while the second term ( @xmath46 ) is geometric , and will be present in any theory that accounts for combination frequencies using nonlinear mixing . in wu s theory , the @xmath0 and @xmath5 dependence is entirely contained within this geometric term ( except for the @xmath0 dependence of the bolometric correction discussed before ) . thus mode identification is possible if changes in @xmath46 with @xmath0 are large compared to the natural variations in @xmath45 .    in this respect ,",
    "the theory of wu is promising .",
    "for any individual star with multiple pulsation modes , the only parameter in @xmath45 that changes from one mode to another is @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the functional dependence on @xmath47 is such that for typical zz ceti _ sum _ frequencies the variations in @xmath45 are so small that @xmath45 @xmath48 constant ( see figure  [ f ] ) .",
    "the same is not true for difference frequencies , which lie at low frequencies and are therefore suppressed . for comparison between modes in two different stars , the other parameters in @xmath45 change slowly , so that small adjustments to @xmath45 should be able to reproduce a variety of stars with similar temperature and mean pulsation period , such as the ensemble we consider in this paper .",
    "the theory of bfw can be expressed in the same form as equation  [ rc ] by replacing @xmath45 with their tabulated atmospheric model parameters .",
    "however the bfw @xmath45 is independent of pulsation frequency for different modes in any single star , so low frequency difference modes are not suppressed . for comparisons between modes in different stars ,",
    "the bfw theory is radically different from wu s .",
    "the bfw @xmath45 term , which is normally an order of magnitude smaller than in the wu theory , grows to comparable size for a narrow range of temperature that depends sensitively on stellar mass .",
    "thus the expectation of the bfw theory is that combination frequencies in _ most _ zz cetis will be smaller than in the theory of wu ( for the same @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , the temperature sensitivity of @xmath45 makes mode identification more problematic if the bfw theory is correct . without very precise temperature measurements , it is impossible to distinguish between large differences in @xmath45 arising from temperature differences , and large changes in @xmath46 , the geometric term , arising from differences in @xmath0 or @xmath25 .",
    "for either theory , the calculation of @xmath46 in equation  [ rc ] requires assigning a value to the inclination of the pulsation axis to our line of sight .",
    "following @xcite , we can estimate the inclination for each star by comparing finely split modes of different @xmath5 .",
    "this requires that we make potentially dubious assumptions about the relative intrinsic sizes of pulsation modes , but the final result is not very sensitive to the assumptions .",
    "figures  [ ggg ] and [ g1111gg ] show why .",
    "figure  [ ggg ] shows the dependence of the geometric factor on inclination for @xmath49 modes .",
    "it varies very slowly over a large range , and then changes rapidly when we look directly down upon a nodal line .",
    "for @xmath2 , this occurs near @xmath50 , because the parent modes are totally geometrically cancelled and the combination frequencies are not .",
    "however , the apparent size of these modes , as opposed to the ratio of their sizes , diminishes rapidly near @xmath51 , and they eventually fall below the noise threshold of the fourier transform . at the same viewing angle , if any @xmath52 modes are present , they will dominate the power spectrum and so will their combination frequencies . as figure  [ g1111gg ] shows ,",
    "these combinations are not very sensitive to inclination for @xmath25 near @xmath51 . in other words ,",
    "the analysis of combination frequencies requires that they be detectable . at low inclination ,",
    "only @xmath49 combination frequencies are detectable and at low inclination these are insensitive to @xmath25 , at high inclinations only @xmath52 modes are detectable and at high inclination these are insensitive to @xmath25 . for higher @xmath0",
    "the situation is more complicated , because there are more nodal lines , but the basic argument still applies .    with this in mind , following @xcite , we have assumed that the intrinsic mode amplitudes are the same for all the modes within a multiplet .",
    "when modes of a specific @xmath0 value are rotationally split into @xmath53 modes , the inclination of a star can be found by equating the amplitude ratio of the @xmath54 peak and an @xmath52 peak with the corresponding ratio of @xmath55 for both values of @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath56 are the coefficients of the spherical harmonic , @xmath57 , and the @xmath58 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "we estimated the inclination for each star by averaging the amplitudes of the @xmath59 members of the largest amplitude @xmath2 multiplets in each star .",
    "there are four stars in our study with detected combination frequencies . for three of these ,",
    "the @xcite method yields low inclination ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the only combination frequencies detected in these stars are combinations of @xmath49 parent modes , as established by their singlet nature or by their central location in a frequency symmetric triplet .",
    "figure  [ ggg ] shows that except for at large inclination , the amplitudes of the combination frequencies are not very sensitive to inclination for the central , @xmath49 , parent modes .",
    "the fourth star ( gd 244 ) has a high inclination ( @xmath61 ) , and shows only combinations of @xmath52 parent modes .",
    "figure  [ g1111gg ] shows that at high inclinations the amplitudes of combination frequencies are not very sensitive to inclination when the parent modes are @xmath59 members of an @xmath2 triplet .",
    "in fact , for certain @xmath5 combinations , the amplitudes of combination frequencies are measured _ independent _ of inclination .",
    "therefore , for all stars that we analyze , the amplitudes of the combination frequencies are at most weakly dependent on the inclination , as long as the value of @xmath0 is small . hence , the approximation of inclination is a small source of error in our analysis .    with independent estimates of inclination ,",
    "the only factor that remains unknown in the factor @xmath46 of the theory of wu is the value of @xmath0 for each mode .",
    "thus we can compare the measured combination frequencies in the data , if any , to the predicted amplitudes of combination frequencies under various assumptions for the @xmath0 value of the parent modes . in this way",
    "we can hope to constrain or actually measure the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we will see that harmonics of a single mode are more valuable in this enterprise than combinations between two different modes .",
    "this is because there is a greater contrast in the theory between same-@xmath0 combinations , and for harmonics there is only one parent , and therefore only one @xmath0 involved . in the section that follows ,",
    "we apply the theory to eight low amplitude hot zz ceti stars , and show that it is possible to establish the values of @xmath0 for most modes in these stars .",
    "the data we present in this section are a combination of published fourier spectra , new reductions of archival whole earth telescope data , and original data obtained with the mcdonald observatory 2.1-m struve telescope .",
    "they constitute all of the currently - available data with frequency resolution sufficient to measure amplitudes or amplitude limits for combination frequencies in hot dav stars .",
    "the purpose of this section is to extract mode frequencies and amplitudes via fourier methods . in principle , phase measurements are also possible , but in practice they are too noisy to be useful . in cases where combination frequencies are not sufficiently above the noise level to detect , we record the upper limit for comparison to theory .        the stars for which we use published data include g117-b15a , g185 - 32 , gd 165 , r548 , and g226 - 29 @xcite .",
    "these stars were all included as secondary target stars in whole earth telescope campaigns ( wet ; * ? ? ? * ) and the referenced papers present these wet data .",
    "@xcite ( gd 165 ) and @xcite ( r548 ) also include canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) observations , and @xcite includes supplemental mcdonald observatory observations .",
    "all of the published data we have analyzed for combination frequencies are found in these publications , along with explanations of the reduction and analysis procedures .",
    "we obtained time - series photometry data on both gd 66 and gd 244 in 2003 and 2004 with the mcdonald observatory 2.1-m struve telescope using the prime - focus argos ccd photometer with a bg40 schott glass filter @xcite .",

    "the second problem is our use of a constant bolometric correction that is really only appropriate for @xmath2 .",
    "this is a limitation inherent to the analytic theory as wu presented it , and could be addressed by employing numerical models , but this would be not be consistent with our objective of having a quick and easily applicable method for mode identification in large numbers of zz ceti stars .",
    "we have calculated bolometric corrections for higher @xmath0 , and the differences are not large enough to change the @xmath101 identification for f3 . so the inconsistency of our @xmath101 identification and the @xmath96 identification of @xcite remains a mystery .",
    "fortunately , for seismological work it is useful to identify a mode as high @xmath0 , even if the exact value is unknown .",

    "so even if a mode identification method based on measurements of @xmath41 alone can not identify high @xmath0 modes precisely , it is still useful for its ability to discriminate between modes of high and low @xmath0 .",

    "we have successfully eliminated @xmath1 identification for all modes in seven of the eight stars in our study . the eighth star , g185 - 32 ,",
    "was previously thought to have a high @xmath0 mode @xcite , and our method confirms this result ( though we get @xmath101 instead of @xmath96 ) .    for modes with sufficiently large amplitude ,",
    "combination frequency amplitudes are further able to discriminate between @xmath2 and @xmath6 , primarily through the use of harmonics .",
    "the harmonics are superior for this purpose because they are known to be same-@xmath0 combinations , and because same-@xmath0 combinations are well - separated in the theoretical plots of @xmath41 .",
    "we were able to identify modes as @xmath2 in six of the eight stars , and in every case our identifications agreed with any previous independent results .",
    "the method we have used requires only time - series photometry and simple calculations as presented in ",
    "[ theory ] .",
    "the essential part of these calculations is the evaluation of the geometric term in wu s theory , which we have named @xmath46 . calculating @xmath46 requires the evaluation of integrals of spherical harmonics in the presence of a limb darkening law . to assist others in application of this technique ,",
    "we have included tabulated matrices of combination frequency integrals for @xmath121 in appendix a. applying these requires a straightforward estimation of the inclination , which we have done using multiplet amplitudes , where detected , and limits on the sizes of multiplet members where not detected .",
    "this has required that we assume that modes of every @xmath5 are excited to the same amplitude in every mode , and that rotation always removes the frequency degeneracy of multiplet members .",
    "fortunately , our results are not highly sensitive to these assumptions .    for convenience ,",
    "we summarize application of the method as follows :    \\1 .",
    "calculate the inclination with the @xcite method using the ratio of the observed amplitudes in a given multiplet .",
    "consult the sensitivity of @xmath46 to inclination ( see figures  [ ggg ] , [ g1111gg ] , and [ g34 ] ) to ensure that @xmath41 is changing slowly with inclination near this value .",
    "calculate the theoretical @xmath41 for both @xmath2 and 2 by approximating @xmath10 with the longest period mode and using the bolometric correction @xmath122 .",
    "we use @xmath84 for hot , low - amplitude da stars , while wu uses @xmath123 for the cool da star g29 - 38 .",
    "compare the calculated @xmath41 with the measured value obtained with the amplitudes of the combinations and their parents .",
    "in addition to our application of this method to eight stars , we have presented analyses of new data on gd 66 and gd 244 that will be useful for seismological study of these objects .",
    "we have not been able to definitively decompose the multiplet structure in these stars with single - site data , but the mode periods we have measured are given in tables  [ tbl - gd66 ] and [ tbl - gd244 ] for comparison to seismological models .",
    "more important than the results for these individual stars is our verification of a quick and easy diagnostic tool that frequently yields definitive results .",
    "we hope the method will find broad and immediate application in the study of numerous zz ceti stars being discovered with the sloan digital sky survey ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these are fainter than the objects we have measured , but photometry on a 4-m class telescope will be sufficient to reach useful detection limits .",
    "for example , if the v=15.56 mag star gd 66 were instead an 18th magnitude star , observations with a 4-m class telescope would reveal four of the combination frequency peaks that we identified , including the harmonics of the two highest amplitude peaks .",
    "further study of the objects in this paper will also be useful , both to secure definitive @xmath0 identifications of the smaller amplitude modes and to detect those combinations that hover just below the detection limits of the present data .",
    "observations are currently in progress using the 4.1-m soar telescope .",
    "this work was supported by a career grant from the national science foundation ( ast 000 - 94289 ) and by two grants from the north carolina space grant consortium .",
    "we thank s. o. kepler for his helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "we also thank the referee , p. a. bradley , for reading the paper extremely carefully and offering many suggestions that have improved this paper .",
    "the following tables contain solutions for @xmath125 ( see equations  [ glm ] and  [ glm ] ) for the values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 that are potentially useful for mode identification with photometry using the theory of wu .",
    "table  [ tbl - g11 ] contains solutions for @xmath93 .",
