    "singularities appear quite generically in classical gravity @xcite .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture states that the only singularities of physical space - times can be : an initial cosmological singularity ( big bang ) , a final cosmological singularity ( big crunch ) , and singularities resulting from gravitational collapse , which are hidden behind event horizons @xcite . to be precise , this is just one version of the cosmic censorship conjecture , called `` version 2 , physical formulation '' in @xcite , to which we refer for an overview . in the case of four - dimensional static space - times , supersymmetry acts as a cosmic censor @xcite , but , since there are non - static stationary supersymmetric solutions with naked singularities @xcite , it is clear that supersymmetry alone is not enough to establish cosmic censorship",
    ".    a satisfactory quantum theory of gravity should not only be capable of establishing cosmic censorship within the semi - classical approximation , but also be able to resolve the cosmological and black - hole singularities .",
    "string and m - theory are currently not able to achieve these goals in general , but have already provided a variety of insights into the problem of singularities .",
    "one new ingredient is the existence of a length scale , @xmath0 , at which internal string states can be excited .",
    "this leads to a very soft uv behaviour of scattering amplitudes , which reflects itself in an infinite series of higher derivative terms , and in particular higher curvature terms , in the low - energy effective action .",
    "although this suggests that curvature singularities are smoothed out , it is very hard to make this explicit , except in situations where the corresponding space - time can be described by an exact conformal field theory . see for example @xcite for a recent application of such techniques to cosmology .    besides higher derivative terms , there is another generic mechanism for avoiding singularities in string and m - theory , which one might call `` the intervention of additional states . ''",
    "one example of this mechanism are twisted states in toroidal orbifold compactifications @xcite , which prevent the conic singularities of these spaces to cause singularities of observable quantities .",
    "recently , time - dependent orbifolds @xcite have become important as models for space - like singularities , including cosmological singularities @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a review and more references .",
    "more elaborate versions of the two basic mechanisms take care of the geometrical singularities occurring at special points in the moduli spaces of calabi - yau compactifications .",
    "such special points are related to flop transitions @xcite , conifold singularities @xcite , conifold transitions @xcite and more general extremal transitions @xcite . here , in general , both @xmath1-corrections and the presence of additional light states descending from p - branes wrapped on p - cycles of the internal manifold need to be taken into account in order to obtain non - singular physical quantities .    while the above examples concern singularities in an internal , compact manifold , one can also obtain new insights into space - time singularities by considering the full string or m - theory dynamics instead of a naive supergravity approximation .",
    "a fascinating interplay between internal , compact space and non - compact space - time is exhibited by the enhanon @xcite . here",
    ", one considers certain space - time geometries which have a naked curvature singularity in the supergravity approximation .",
    "however , by considering the full string theory one realises that before the singularity can be reached , particular modes of branes wrapped on internal cycles become light , and therefore must be taken into account .",
    "the resulting space - time geometry is then free of naked singularities .",
    "this mechanism , which has been first observed in a specific compactification with @xmath2  @xmath3  @xmath4 supersymmetry , seems to be quite generic .",
    "for instance , a version of it was discovered in domain - wall solutions of eleven - dimensional supergravity compactified on a calabi - yau three - fold with g - flux @xcite .",
    "this compactification describes the bulk dynamics of five - dimensional heterotic m - theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that a similar mechanism prohibits naked singularities of electric and magnetic bps solutions of ungauged five - dimensional supergravity , when embedded into m - theory compactified on a calabi - yau three - fold ( without g - flux )",
    ". however , except in the case of magnetic bps solutions , one has specific examples instead of a general proof .    in this paper",
    "we make a step towards a model - independent analysis of space - time singularities in m - theory compactifications .",
    "the basic idea is to work out systematically the relation between the geometries of the internal space and of space - time , and to prove that one always encounters new m - theory physics , such as additional light states , when , or even before a naked space - time singularity occurs .",
    "since we work with the dimensionally reduced low - energy effective action , the geometry of the internal space is encoded in space - time dependent scalar fields ( moduli ) , while the space - time geometry is obtained by solving the equations of motion .",
    "we therefore have to relate space - time geometry , in particular curvature invariants to the geometry of the moduli space .",
    "concretely , we consider eleven - dimensional supergravity compactified on calabi - yau three - folds and prove that five - dimensional bps domain - wall solutions ( and electric bps solutions ) can not have curvature singularities as long as the moduli fields take values in the interior of the extended khler cone . the only way solutions can become singular is when the boundary of the extended khler cone is reached , but there the internal manifold becomes singular and the description in terms of a five - dimensional effective supergravity theory is not valid .",
    "we will not address the physics of these singularities in this paper , but make a proposal how they can be approached in the conclusions .",
    "there are also supergravity solutions with naked singularities which are not related to boundaries of the extended khler cone @xcite .",
    "these are artifacts of a naive supergravity treatment .",
    "the extended khler cone is obtained by gluing together the khler cones of different calabi - yau spaces , which are related by topological transitions . along the corresponding internal boundaries of the extended khler cone ,",
    "the effective supergravity lagrangian is non - singular , but its parameters change through threshold corrections of m - theory modes which become massless .",
    "if this effect is ignored , one leaves the m - theory moduli space , and naked space - time singularities can and will occur .",
    "if , however , the effects of the interior boundaries are taken into account correctly , one moves from the khler cone of one calabi - yau three - fold into the khler cone of another one . in this paper",
    "we prove that solutions are non - singular while the moduli take values ( i ) inside the khler cone or ( ii ) on interior boundaries of the extended khler cone .",
    "therefore we know that as long as the scalars are inside the extended khler cone no naked singularities occur . if they seem to be present in a naive supergravity treatment , we are guaranteed to reach an internal boundary of the extended khler cone before we reach the singularity .",
    "in other words , the `` enhanon - mechanism '' for domain walls and electric bps solutions , which was observed in particular models @xcite , works in general .",
    "this implies that electric bps solutions , which are the space - times of minimal adm mass for a given total electric charge , are always black holes , and never have naked singularities , as long as the moduli take values inside the extended khler cone .",
    "similarly , domain walls can only become singular when the moduli reach the boundary of the extended khler cone .",
    "thus we establish an , albeit limited , version of cosmic censorship which might be phrased as `` the khler cone is a cosmic censor . '' as a by - product we obtain various nice relations between geometrical quantities of the khler cone and of space - time .",
    "we show explicitly how the behaviour of the metric of the khler cone on the boundaries is related to the geometrical degeneration and the new physics occurring there .",
    "our results confirm that the interplay between internal and space - time geometry is of central importance in string theory .",
    "moreover , when working with effective supergravity actions , string theory physics is only captured if all relevant modes of the full theory are taken into account . for more work along these lines",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  2.1 introduces domain - wall solutions of five - dimensional gauged supergravity theories .",
    "the analysis of space - time curvature singularities is performed in section  2.2 , and the relation to calabi - yau flux compactifications of m - theory is reviewed in section  2.3 .",
    "the main results of this paper reside in section  3 , where certain properties of the calabi - yau khler - cone metric are proven . in section  4",
    "we explain how our arguments can be applied to electric bps solutions of ungauged five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  5 .",
    "we consider two classes of 1/2-bps solutions of five - dimensional @xmath2  @xmath3  @xmath5 supergravity @xcite , domain - wall , and black - hole solutions .",
    "since these solutions have many features in common , we focus on the domain - wall solutions in the following .",
    "the following arguments can be adapted to black - hole solutions , as we will show in section  4 .      in this subsection",
    ", we review the domain - wall solution of a class of five - dimensional gauged supergravity theories , which describes the bulk dynamics of hoava - witten theory compactified on a calabi - yau three - fold @xcite .",
    "the bosonic fields are part of the following multiplets : metric and graviphoton , \\{@xmath6 , @xmath7 } , belong to the gravity multiplet .",
    "there are @xmath8 vector fields and scalars , \\{@xmath9 , @xmath10 } , @xmath11  @xmath12  @xmath13 in vector multiplets .",
    "furthermore , we consider the universal hypermultiplet ( uhm ) , \\{@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 } , consisting of two real and one complex scalar",
    ". the theory might contain additional hypermultiplets which , however , do not play a role in the domain - wall solutions we consider .    the scalar fields @xmath10 parametrise a degree - three hyper - surface in @xmath18 @xcite @xmath19 determined by the real , symmetric , and constant coefficients @xmath20 . as the graviphoton @xmath21 and",
    "the vector multiplet gauge fields @xmath22 combine into @xmath23 vector fields @xmath24 , we combine the @xmath8 scalars @xmath10 and @xmath14 together , anticipating the structure we will obtain by dimensional reduction , and define @xmath25 we consider a particular gauging of the axion in the uhm , which induces a potential for the moduli . as a consequence ,",
    "neither flat minkowski space nor @xmath26 space is a solution .",
    "the most symmetric solutions are 1/2-bps solutions , invariant under 4 supercharges and under 4-dimensional lorentz transformations , only",

    "this function is related to the scalar moduli by @xmath30 = v(y ) = \\left (      \\frac{1}{6}\\;c_{ijk}y^i(y)y^j(y)y^k(y )      \\right)^2\\;.\\ ] ] the moduli @xmath31 , in turn , are determined in terms of harmonic functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 note that the domain - wall solution is completely fixed by a flow on the scalar manifold which is parameterised by the transverse coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "the solution starts at @xmath29  @xmath3  @xmath34 at a particular point on the scalar manifold and evolves as determined by the equations ( [ eq : dw_metric])([eq : stab ] ) until it terminates at a different point at @xmath29  @xmath3  @xmath35 .",
    "since the five - dimensional theory does not have fully supersymmetric ground states , there is no fixed - point behaviour and we have to introduce boundaries at the positions @xmath34 , @xmath35 by hand . the so - called generalised stabilisation equations ( [ eq : stab ] ) are an universal feature of both , domain - wall and black - hole solutions , and therefore the following analysis of ( space - time ) curvature singularities can be adapted for black - hole solutions , as we will show in section  4 .      here",
    ", we investigate the occurrence of space - time curvature singularities .",
    "we start by calculating the ricci scalar of the metric ( [ eq : dw_metric ] ) and then analyse possible sources of divergences .",
    "the ricci scalar is given by ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37\\;\\big ( 3u'u'-2u '' \\big)\\;.\\ ] ] this expression can diverge ( @xmath28 is related to @xmath14 by equation ( [ eq : uv ] ) ) :    1 .",
    "if either @xmath38\\rightarrow\\infty$ ] ( @xmath39 ) , 2 .   or if the first or second derivatives of @xmath28 ( or @xmath14 ) diverge",
    ".    since the line element ( [ eq : dw_metric ] ) depends only on the function @xmath28 , all components of the riemann tensor are polynomials in @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "hence , our analysis applies to all curvature invariants of the domain - wall metric .",
    "since case ( i ) has already been covered in the literature @xcite , it remains to analyse the somewhat less obvious case ( ii ) , _ i.e. _ ,  diverging curvature invariants at finite and non - zero @xmath14 .",
    "it is convenient to consider the first derivative of @xmath42 instead of @xmath14 : @xmath43 where in the last step we have used the relation @xmath44 which follows from differentiating ( [ eq : stab ] ) with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "since the harmonic functions @xmath45 are at most linear in @xmath29 , @xmath46 is regular as long as the moduli @xmath47 are finite @xcite .    differentiating equation ( [ eq : v ] ) once more we find @xmath48 clearly , @xmath49 can blow up if @xmath50 diverges . by introducing the matrix @xcite @xmath51 we can invert equation ( [ eq : stab ] ) : @xmath52 of course this inversion is only formal , because it requires to compute @xmath53 as a function of the moduli @xmath47 . since @xmath54  const , @xmath55  @xmath56  @xmath57 when @xmath58 is not invertible , or , equivalently , when @xmath59  @xmath3  @xmath60 . using the last equation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 the appearance of the matrix @xmath58 is the link between space - time curvature singularities and properties of the moduli - space metric , which we will deal with in section  3 .",
    "we have shown that there are two possible causes for curvature singularities of domain - wall solutions : ( i ) @xmath14  @xmath56  @xmath60 , and ( ii ) @xmath58 non - invertible at finite @xmath14  @xmath62  @xmath60 .",
    "let us demonstrate that these curvature singularities do occur _ generically _ : since @xmath14 is a homogeneous function of degree three in the moduli @xmath47 , it will have zeros if the moduli @xmath47 are allowed to take arbitrary real values .",
    "this covers case ( i ) . as for case ( ii ) ,",
    "a generic matrix @xmath58 is invertible , but becomes singular in co - dimension one in parameter space .",
    "in other words , if no additional conditions on the parameters are imposed , the set of solutions will decompose into two subsets : those , which do not cross the hyperplanes where @xmath58 becomes singular , and those which do .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in the examples considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases",
    "singular and non - singular space - time geometries are equally generic , and supergravity does not provide any constraints on the parameters which exclude the singular solutions .",
    "the difference between case ( i ) and case ( ii ) is that in the first case the metric on the scalar manifold diverges , while it develops a zero eigenvalue in the second case .",
    "thus , the five - dimensional supergravity lagrangian becomes singular , which indicates that we need input from an underlying fundamental theory .",
    "we will see that this input is provided by m - theory , if the supergravity theory is obtained as a calabi - yau compactification .      here",
    ", we recall how five - dimensional gauged supergravity can be obtained by compactification of eleven - dimensional supergravity on calabi - yau three - folds in the presence of background flux .",
    "there are two points of view concerning the relation of gauged five - dimensional supergravity actions to eleven - dimensional supergravity theory : ( i ) compactification on a calabi - yau manifold , assuming that the flux only excites calabi - yau zero - modes and does not deform the calabi - yau structure .",
    "the presence of background flux is taken into account by including it as a `` non - zero mode , '' see refs .",
    "@xcite . or , ( ii ) , compactification on a `` deformed '' calabi - yau manifold @xcite .",
    "we describe the first approach .",
    "the bosonic fields of eleven - dimensional supergravity consist of the metric and of a three - form gauge potential @xmath63 with associated four - form field strength @xmath64 .",
    "we start by specifying a basis of the second cohomology group consisting of @xmath65 harmonic @xmath66 forms @xmath67 .",
    "the khler form can be expanded in this basis , @xmath68 with real moduli @xmath69 , which are related to the moduli of secion  2 by the rescaling @xmath69  @xmath70  @xmath71  @xmath3  @xmath72 .",
    "since we will need a basis of @xmath73 and of the even homology of @xmath74 , we introduce dual 4-forms , 2-cycles , and 4-cycles . by poincar duality",

    "having introduced a basis for the even ( co-)homology , we now describe how the bosonic fields of section  2 descend from the fields of eleven - dimensional supergravity : @xmath79 here , @xmath80 denotes the holomorphic @xmath81 form which exists on every calabi - yau three - fold .",
    "the fields @xmath82 of section  2.1 parameterise the relative sizes of the cycles of @xmath74 , whereas the uhm scalar @xmath14 parameterises the volume of @xmath74 .",
    "the axion @xmath15 comes from dualising the dimensionally reduced 4-form field strength , and therefore has a shift symmetry : @xmath83 .    in principle ,",
    "dimensional reduction on a generic calabi - yau manifold yields more hypermultiplets than the uhm alone . for the type of domain - wall solutions",
    "we consider , these extra hypermultiplets are spectators , and it is a consistent truncation to keep these fields constant .    following @xcite we turn on background flux in a way that the flux back - reaction on geometry is such that it excites calabi - yau zero - modes only , and does not distort the calabi - yau structure . since the background four - form flux is an element of @xmath84  @xmath3  @xmath73 , it can be expanded as follows @xmath85 with constants @xmath86 subject to a quantisation condition @xcite .",
    "however , within the supergravity approximation the flux parameters can be taken to be continuous as discussed in ref .",

    "_ , @xmath14  @xmath3  @xmath60 ) and generically curvature singularities occur in domain wall solutions .",

    "this becomes more transparent through dimensional reduction to @xmath184 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the ricci scalar corresponding to the above line element takes the form @xmath185\\big ( ru''+3r(u')^2 + 3u'\\big)\\;.\\ ] ] in the coordinates we have chosen , the solution becomes asymptotically flat for @xmath181  @xmath56  @xmath57 , whereas @xmath186 is either the event horizon of a black hole , or a singularity .",
    "the limit @xmath181  @xmath56  @xmath60 is related to",
    "the celebrated black - hole attractor mechanism , which was first discovered in four - dimensional extended supersymmetry @xcite , but also occurs in five - dimensional supergravity @xcite .",
    "bps solutions of supergravities with eight supercharges have four killing spinors , but if one imposes that they behave regularly at @xmath181  @xmath3  @xmath60 , then the number of killing spinors must double in the limit @xmath181  @xmath56  @xmath60 .",

    "these geometries describe the event horizons of black holes , which are generalisations of the extreme reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "moreover , the scalar fields take discrete fixed point values at the horizon , which are determined by the so - called stabilisation equations .",
    "the attractor mechanism is crucial for understanding black - hole entropy along the lines of @xcite , because it implies that the bekenstein - hawking entropy does not change when varying the values of scalar fields at infinity . while the original work of @xcite focused on the behaviour of four - dimensional black holes close to their horizon , it soon became clear that the corresponding full black - hole solutions are determined by a rescaled version of the stabilisation equations , which have been called generalised stabilisation equations @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ stabbh ] ) is the five - dimensional version of the generalised stabilisation equation , and the stabilisation equation determining the geometry at @xmath181  @xmath56  @xmath60 can be found by a suitable scaling limit @xcite . in four dimensions",
    "it has been shown that the generalised stabilisation equations are not only sufficient , but also necessary for having a supersymmetric solution @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that one can not switch on non - trivial hypermultiplets , but that it is possible to include the effect of certain higher curvature terms @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review .",
    "these results should survive in the de - compactification limit and therefore also apply to five - dimensional black holes .",
    "note that the supersymmetric attractor mechanism , which we just reviewed , does not occur in the domain - wall solutions of hoava - witten theory .",
    "the reason is that the five - dimensional bulk supergravity theory does not have fully supersymmetric solutions , due to the runaway of the volume modulus @xcite .",
    "therefore these domain walls do not interpolate between vacua , but have to be cut by introducing boundaries .",
    "even though there is no fixed - point behaviour in these solutions , they are nevertheless determined by the generalised stabilisation equations ( [ eq : stab ] ) .",
    "there are other five - dimensional gauged supergravities , in particular those obtained by gauging the r - symmetries of vector multiplets @xcite , which have domain walls interpolating different ads vacua . for those the attractor mechanism applies , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "however , it is not known how to obtain these supergravities as compactifications of string or m - theory .",
    "one interesting speculation is that the run - away behaviour of the volume in hoava - witten domain walls stops , once a minimal volume of the calabi - yau space has been reached @xcite .",
    "this has found some support recently by new results about loop corrections to the universal hypermultiplet @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the question of naked singularities in electric bps solutions .",
    "since the behaviour at @xmath181  @xmath3  @xmath60 is taken care of by the attractor mechanism , we only need to analyse under which conditions a solution can develop a naked singularity for finite values @xmath181",
    "@xmath3  @xmath191 , @xmath57  @xmath168  @xmath191  @xmath168  @xmath60 of the radial variable . as for domain walls ,",
    "the solution is determined by a flow on the vector - multiplet manifold , which is now parametrised by @xmath181 , @xmath57  @xmath168  @xmath181  @xmath168  @xmath60 , instead of @xmath29 . whereas the parameters @xmath183 determine the behaviour for @xmath181  @xmath56  @xmath57 , the parameters @xmath182 determine it for @xmath181  @xmath56  @xmath60 . by inspection of the ricci scalar , and of other curvature invariants ,",
    "a curvature singularity occurs if and only if either @xmath28  @xmath3  @xmath60 , or if @xmath40 or @xmath41 diverge at @xmath181  @xmath3  @xmath191 . since @xmath181  @xmath168  @xmath60 ,",
    "the harmonic functions @xmath45 and all their derivatives are finite , and the analysis done for domain walls goes through .",
    "thus we find again that in supergravity regular and singular solutions are equally generic , while solutions in calabi - yau compactifications can not become singular , as long as the scalar fields take values inside the extended khler cone .",
    "singularities do occur when the moduli reach the boundary of the extended khler cone .    for completeness ,",
    "let us finally mention further details which are different from the case of domain walls , but fortunately do not interfere with our analysis .",
    "these differences occur because in ungauged supergravity vector and hypermultiplets only couple through gravity , while there are gauge couplings and a scalar potential in gauged supergravity . as we have already mentioned",
    "the hypermultiplets are trivial in electric bps solutions .",
    "since the overall volume of the internal space sits in a hypermultiplet , this implies that it is constant , in contrast to the domain - wall case , where it is a specific function of the vector - multiplet moduli ( [ eq : uv ] ) .",
    "this has some impact on the discussion of the cubic cone , where the calabi - yau volume goes to zero . while this locus can be approached in domain - wall solutions , it can not in black - hole solutions , because the volume is fixed",
    "nevertheless , there is a related degeneration occurring in the black - hole case , where some cycles go to zero while other go to infinity , in such a way that the total volume is constant .",
    "this happens for example at one boundary of the khler cone of the @xmath192-model @xcite .",
    "another minor difference is that , as we have seen in section  2 , for domain walls one can prove that @xmath40 can not diverge if @xmath28 is finite .",
    "the difference is that derivatives of the linear functions @xmath32 are constant or vanishing , while the derivatives of the functions @xmath179 are not constant , though still finite . as a consequence , in the black - hole case @xmath40 can become singular for finite @xmath28 , but",
    "this can only happen outside the extended khler cone , or at points on its boundary .",
    "we have analysed domain - wall solutions ( [ eq : dw_metric ] ) of five - dimensional gauged supergravity theories . our analysis applies , with only minor modifications , to black - hole solutions of ungauged supergravity .",
    "in particular , we have investigated the appearance of curvature singularities in domain - wall solutions and found that there are two possible causes , namely @xmath14  @xmath56  @xmath60 and @xmath193  @xmath56  @xmath57 . within a pure supergravity perspective",
    "this is all what can be achieved .    embedding these theories into a higher - dimensional theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , eleven - dimensional supergravity on a calabi - yau flux background , changes the situation : the five - dimensional scalar fields become identified with volumes of 2-cycles in the calabi - yau three - fold .",
    "therefore , they are required to take values inside the khler cone of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "we have proven that naked curvature singularities can not occur as long as the scalars take values inside the extended khler cone .",
    "singularities do appear when the scalars reach the boundary , where the internal manifold and the five - dimensional effective supergravity action become singular , and where one needs to understand new m - theory physics , such as tensionless strings .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained model - independent information on the behaviour of the khler moduli - space metric near boundaries of the khler cone .",
    "we have proven that the moduli - space metric is regular at boundaries of type i and of type iii , whereas it develops zero eigenvalues at boundaries of type ii and diverges at the cubic cone , see  table  [ boundres ] .",
    "our result is consistent with the fact that one can extend the khler cone at boundaries with type - i and type - iii contractions by gluing the khler cone of a different calabi - yau manifold to the corresponding face @xcite .",
    "moreover , it complements the other important model - independent result about black holes in calabi - yau compactifications of m - theory , which states that attractor points are unique in the extended khler cone @xcite .",
    "results about other geometries support the idea that the enhanon - like mechanism , established in this paper for domain walls and electric bps solutions , is much more generic .",
    "in particular , ungauged five - dimensional supergravity also has magnetic bps solutions @xcite . for these",
    "it is very simple to show that they can not have naked singularities as long as the moduli take values in the extended khler cone @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was observed that cosmological solutions of kasner type do not become singular , as long as the moduli take values in the extended khler cone @xcite .",
    "a natural next step is trying to establish a similar mechanism for black holes of four - dimensional @xmath2  @xmath3  @xmath5 supergravity . since in this case one has to deal with a holomorphic instead of a real cubic prepotential",
    ", this will require a non - trivial extension of the framework used in this paper . when considering type - iia string theory on a calabi - yau three - fold , which is the dimensional reduction of the m - theory setup employed in this paper , then the moduli space is a complexified version of the khler cone .",
    "now the overall volume @xmath14 sits in a vector multiplet , and the metric on the khler cone gets @xmath1-corrections .",
    "moreover , the former boundaries of the khler cone now become so - called non - geometric phases , which are not described by calabi - yau sigma models , but by other types of world - sheet conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "this is a technical complication , but a physical bonus , because now the cubic cone is on the same footing as the other degenerations .",
    "for example , the khler cone of the @xmath159-model has a boundary which belongs to the cubic cone @xcite .",
    "after dimensional reduction , this region corresponds to a landau - ginsburg theory .",
    "moreover , one can use mirror symmetry to study iib string theory on the mirror calabi - yau manifold instead . in this description",
    "the relevant scalar manifold is the moduli space of complex structures , which does neither get @xmath1 nor string loop corrections .",
    "thus the best strategy is to investigate the links between complex - structure moduli spaces of calabi - yau spaces and bps space - time geometries .",
    "this is a vast and very interesting subject , and some of its aspects have already been explored @xcite .",
    "singularities of the complex moduli space occur in complex co - dimension one , only . therefore they will be avoided by generic solutions .",
    "many of the singularities in co - dimension one and higher have known physical interpretations in terms of additional massless states coming from wrapped d - branes .",
    "since d - branes can be treated by world - sheet techniques , one now has additional tools besides effective supergravity .",
    "in particular , the best strategy to understand the m - theory physics of the cubic cone and of tensionless strings is the dimensional reduction to type ii string theory .",
    "a point which deserves further investigation is the relation of supergravity actions to string compactification on singular calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "two different questions can be investigated in this context : first , we would like to know what are the supergravity lagrangians corresponding to the `` @xmath125 '' boundary theories , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  which supergravity lagrangians correspond to the non - geometric phases . and",
    "secondly , it would be interesting to use the supergravity description in order to learn about the cohomology and intersection homology of the singular calabi - yau three - folds obtained by type i , ii and iii contractions .",
