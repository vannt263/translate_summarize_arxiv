    "the dynamics of dust particles in the inner solar system has been previously addressed by many authors in different contexts : effects of radiation forces on circumsolar @xcite and circumplanetary @xcite grains , electromagnetic interaction of interplanetary dust particles with the magnetic field of the solar wind ( landgraf 2000 ) , grain dynamics in planetary magnetospheres ( horanyi 1996 ) , and so on .",
    "recent discoveries of debris disks around young stars have brought to light additional physical effects related to dust dynamics such as collisions between the dust particles ( stark & kuchner 2009 ) and their resonant interaction with planetary bodies leading to asymmetries and gaps in debris disks ( wyatt 2008 ) .    at the same time",
    "the dynamics of dust particles in the outer solar system ( oss ) has received much less attention . here",
    "the outer solar system means the region of space outside of the bow shock at 250 au ( richardson & stone 2009 ) where unperturbed inflowing material from the interstellar medium ( ism ; see table [ ismphases ] for a summary of ism properties ) undergoes a shock transition , and extending all the way to the outer edge of the oort cloud of comets , roughly at @xmath4 au ( fernandez 1999 ) .",
    "the solar wind does not penetrate into this part of the solar system , but the dust grains there move through the flow of ism material , which perturbs their orbits .",
    "this makes the problem of determining the orbital evolution of grains different in the oort cloud as compared to the kuiper belt , since the charged component of the ism flow does not penetrate to the kuiper belt ; instead , the effects of the solar wind and planetary perturbations are important there @xcite",
    ". effects of the neutral component of the ism flow on the kuiper belt dust particles have been considered by scherer ( 2000 ) and pstor ( 2010 ) .",
    "although in this work we are concerned with the dynamics of grains in the oss and not their origin , we speculate that the abundance of grains should be correlated with the spatial distribution of larger bodies such as comets . this is because collisions between larger bodies create a fragmentation cascade down to smaller sizes . at the moment",
    "our knowledge of spatial distribution of comets heavily relies on numerical simulations of oort cloud formation and evolution .",
    "such calculations typically produce a cloud having both an inner and an outer edge @xcite .",
    "the location of the outer edge in simulations is between @xmath5 au , which is only a factor of a few smaller than the typical dimension of the last closed hill surface @xcite , beyond which objects are unbound from the solar system by the galactic tide .",
    "another result from simulations @xcite is that the cometary density rises towards the inner edge , and it is thus likely that dust production is highest there .",
    "however , the location of the inner edge depends on the environment in which the solar system formed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that if the solar system formed in a cluster , the location of the inner edge can vary from roughly @xmath6 to @xmath7 depending on the stellar density in the cluster .",
    "higher stellar densities help stabilize a planetesimal kicked out by the giant planets at a smaller value of the semimajor axis . for this paper , we take the inner edge to be at @xmath7 , and results by @xcite suggest that most of the long period comets entering the solar system have initial semimajor axes at this distance .",
    "this implies that the inner edge should be no further than this distance , although it could be closer in .",
    "the goal of this work is to explore the dynamics of dust grains in the oss by carefully analyzing different processes affecting their motion .",
    "possible observational manifestations of such grains may provide us with information about the oort cloud and the collisional processes in it .",
    "another reason for this study is that dust produced in the oss may help to understand the flow of big interstellar dust grains recently detected by the _ galileo _",
    ", _ ulysses _ , and _ cassini _ satellites ( grun 1994 ; landgraf 2000 ; altobelli 2003 ) and may contribute to the flux of micro - meteoroids observed at earth @xcite . while our work was being refereed , we became aware of the paper by pstor ( 2010 ) which discusses similar processes in the kuiper belt .",
    "although their work has some similarities with our study , the methods they employed and some of their results are different .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ perturbations ]",
    "we analyze the importance of different forces for the dynamics of dust grains . in  [ stark ]",
    "we explore the secular effects of these forces on grain motion in the framework of the stark problem . in  [ sect : orbdecay ] we turn to the decay of dust particle orbits caused by the total drag ( combined effect of gas and coulomb drag ) , and in  [ dgdapplication ] we discuss applications of our results for dust evolution in the oss .",
    "finally , in  [ satellites ] we briefly discuss the possibility that the large interstellar grains observed by the satellites originate in the oort cloud .",
    "if the ism were absent in the oss , to a zeroth order approximation , the dust particles residing there would move around the barycenter of the solar system ( bss ) on keplerian orbits modified by radiation pressure .",
    "these orbits would slowly evolve under the action of the poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag , the galactic tide , and close stellar passages ( heisler & tremaine 1986 ) .",
    "the keplerian orbital period of a body with semi - major axis @xmath8 is ( neglecting radiation pressure ) t_k=2()^1/2=10 ^ 6 a_4",
    "^ 3/2 , [ eq : t_k ] where @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of the ism flow changes this simple picture .",
    "first , it gives rise to gas drag on the grains simply due to collisions of neutrals with the grain surface .",
    "second , grains are expected to be photoelectrically charged to a potential of several volts ( note that scherer ( 2000 ) and pstor ( 2010 ) have considered the case of neutral grains only ) .",
    "if the ism has some ionized component , this gives rise to the coulomb drag , which is the electric analog of dynamical friction @xcite and is caused by the deflection of ions around a charged grain .",
    "third , the magnetic field of the ism also interacts with charged grains . for small enough particles ( or dense enough ism )",
    "these forces can be stronger than the gravitational attraction to the bss making dust grains unbound ( see  [ particleejection ] ) . in   [ subsect : em]-[subsect : rad ] we analyze the relative effect of these and other forces on the grain dynamics in a variety of circumstances .    at present , the solar system is moving at a velocity of @xmath10 km s@xmath11 through the warm phase of the ism which is characterized by a gas number density @xmath12 @xmath13 , temperature @xmath14 k , and ionization fraction @xmath15 ( frisch 2009 ) .",
    "the strength and orientation of the magnetic field carried with the wind are rather uncertain , but a typical estimate is @xmath16 g ( opher 2009 ) . as the solar system moves through different phases of the ism , the properties of the ism wind may change quite dramatically compared to these numbers .",
    "thus , we need to separately study the effects of the ism flow on grains in different ism phases .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the relative solar system - ism velocity stays equal to @xmath10 km s@xmath11 at all times .",
    "dust grains are assumed to be spherical and to have a density of @xmath17 g @xmath13 .",
    "the grain radius @xmath18 is a variable parameter , but in this study we will focus on the dynamics of rather large ( by ism standards ) particles with @xmath19 m , because such particles have been detected in satellite observations ( kruger & grun 2009 ) .",
    ".hydrogen number density @xmath20 , temperature @xmath21 , filling factor @xmath22 , ionization fraction @xmath23 ( draine 2010 ) , and derived parameters  drag factor @xmath24 ( equation [ [ qeq ] ] ) , and quantities @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( equation [ [ seqn ] ] ) , which are proportional to the ion and electron mach numbers of the grain  for various ism phases . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to study the case of a nonzero initial velocity , we performed monte carlo simulations where we initialized particles at a given radius to have a random orientation of @xmath27 and a kinetic energy which is a fixed fraction @xmath28 of their gravitational potential energy : @xmath29 .",
    "the initial semi - major axis @xmath30 can then be expressed in terms of the initial radius as @xmath31 , which allows the calculation of @xmath32 in each case .",
    "the case of zero initial velocity corresponds to @xmath33 . in all non - zero initial velocity cases",
    "simulated here we found the general analytical ejection criteria ( [ eq : pot])-([eq : bound ] ) to correctly predict whether particles are bound to the solar system .",
    "figure [ kecontoursfig ] shows the effect of varying @xmath28 on the value of @xmath32 required for ejection . in the case of @xmath34 , each initial particle position",
    "is characterized by some _ probability _ of ejection since whether a body is ejected or not depends on the orientation of @xmath27 , and we display these probabilities with color maps .",
    "most notably , figure [ kecontoursfig ] shows that for @xmath35 there exists an outer boundary beyond which all particles are ejected regardless of their initial velocity , an inner boundary inside of which all orbits are bound for @xmath36 , and a region in between in which orbits can be bound or unbound depending on the orientation of @xmath27 .",
    "as @xmath27 increases and @xmath28 becomes larger , the inner and outer ejection boundaries become more elongated along the direction of @xmath37 , and ejection can occur for certain orbits even if @xmath38 , whereas some orbits can remain bound even if @xmath39 . however , even for @xmath28 as high as @xmath40 the simple ejection criterion ( equation [ [ eq : ejsimple ] ] ) still provides a good estimate of the radius at which particles become unbound to within a factor of two .",
    "in figure [ ismejection ] we use the ejection criterion from equation ( [ eq : ejsimple ] ) to determine whether particles are bound or unbound at different separations from the bss in different ism phases .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that independent of the inflowing ism phase , particles as large as @xmath41 m should be ejected by the electromagnetic force at @xmath42 au , while at @xmath43 au only particles with @xmath44 m are unbound ( equation [ [ rgmine ] ] ) .",
    "bigger grains can also be removed in passages through the denser phases of the ism . in particular",
    ", passages through molecular clouds would eject bodies as large as @xmath45 m in size at @xmath3 au due to the total drag force , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "very small particles for which @xmath46 should be rapidly coupled to the ism flow by the non - gravitational forces .",
    "we introduce the _ coupling particle size _ @xmath47 as the size for which the coupling distance is equal to the initial particle semi - major axis , i.e. @xmath48 . particles with @xmath49 rapidly attain a velocity @xmath50 in the solar frame .",
    "this makes it necessary to consider the stark force as a function of velocity and take the magnetic force into consideration , since the relation @xmath51 is no longer valid .",
    "the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath8 is shown in figure [ radiusradius ] by a dashed line .",
    "it is clear that efficient coupling to the ism on scales of order the initial size of the system is possible only for particles with @xmath18 considerably smaller than the size at which ejection occurs",
    ". particles with @xmath52 passing close to the inner solar system should have speeds considerably different from ( smaller than ) @xmath53 .",
    "we now consider the effect of the differential drag force @xmath54 on the motion of dust particles .",
    "@xmath54 explicitly depends on the keplerian velocity of the grain , and plugging the expression for @xmath54 from equation ( [ masterdrag ] ) into the equations for the evolution of the osculating elements @xcite , one obtains the following equation for the orbit - averaged rate of change of the semi - major axis @xmath55 , \\label{eq : dadtdifdrag } \\ea where we have defined \\ba \\beta \\equiv e^{-2}\\left[\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-e^2}\\right )   \\left(\\frac{{\\bf v}_w \\cdot \\hat{\\bf a}}{v_w}\\right)^2 + \\left(e^2 - 1   + \\sqrt{1-e^2}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{{\\bf v}_w \\cdot    \\hat{\\bf b}}{v_w } \\right)^2\\right ] , \\label{eq : betadef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are orthonormal unit vectors with @xmath56 pointing towards the pericenter , @xmath58 aligned with the particle s angular momentum vector , and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dadtdifdrag ] ) agrees with the results of pstor 2010 who obtained it for the special case of a drag force that depends quadratically on the velocity .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 has the property that @xmath61 for any @xmath62 .",
    "although @xmath60 varies on timescales of order @xmath63 because of the secular changes in eccentricity and orientation of the orbit , we can average the right - hand side of equation ( [ axisdecay ] ) over a stark orbit to obtain @xmath64 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where angle brackets with a subscript @xmath65 denote time - averaging over a stark orbit , angle brackets without a subscript denote time - averaging over a keplerian orbit , and @xmath66 is the initial value of the semi - major axis .",
    "the validity of averaging over a stark orbit in equation ( [ eq : simpledecay ] ) hinges upon @xmath67 , since this is the condition for the orbit to be only slightly modified by the differential drag over a timescale @xmath63 .",
    "this condition is satisfied in practice , since according to equations ( [ starkperiod ] ) and ( [ decayconstant ] ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( @xmath70 if , for example , the electric force dominates the total drag force ) .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath71 , the semi - major axis evolves exponentially with an instantaneous decay constant given by @xmath72 .    an immediate consequence of equation ( [ decayconstant ] )",
    "is that the semi - major axis can either grow or decay in time depending on the value of @xmath60 and the sign of @xmath73 . for gas drag , @xmath74 for any @xmath75 , so @xmath76 , and",
    "the orbit always decays with time . on the other hand , for pure coulomb drag @xmath77 if the mach number of the ism flow with respect to the sound speed of the ionized component @xmath78 ( equations [ [ qeq]]-[[eq : lambda ] ] ) .",
    "thus , depending on the value of @xmath60 , the semi - major axis can either grow or decay with time .",
    "an interesting question is whether differential drag can cause the _ expansion _ of particle orbits under realistic ism conditions . according to equation ( [ decayconstant ] )",
    "this amounts to a calculation of @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the magnitude of the force due to both gas and coulomb drag combined under actual ism conditions .",
    "the results of such a calculations are presented in figure [ dfdvfig ] and clearly show that for any grain size in any of the ism phases @xmath81 , meaning that a particle s semi - major axis can only _ decay _ ( @xmath76 ) under the action of the differential drag force .",
    "having explored the forces that affect the dynamics of dust grains in the oss , we are now in a position to describe their long - term evolution after they have been created in collisions of larger objects ( e.g. comets ) .",
    "our discussion will predominantly focus on two important questions .",
    "first , what is the survival time @xmath82 of a dust particle of a given size located at a given separation from the bss against ejection by the ism flow .",
    "second , how does the semi - major axis of a particle change as a result of differential drag during its lifetime in the oss ?    in addressing these questions we must realize that through its 4.5 gyr history , the solar system has sampled different phases of the ism , which must have subjected dust grains in the oss to broadly varying ambient conditions . as a result , grains which are only weakly affected by the ism flow when the solar system passes through one phase ( e.g. the coronal gas )",
    "may become fully coupled to this flow in another phase ( e.g. a molecular cloud ) , see figure [ radiusradius ] .",
    "therefore there are several possible classes into which dust grains can be separated from the point of view of their long - term dynamics :    * class a covers particles which can survive ejection in the warm and coronal phases of the ism , but which will be ejected in a passage through an atomic or molecular cloud . * class b involves particles which are large enough to survive ejection in atomic clouds , but which would be ejected in passages through molecular clouds .",
    "* class c covers particles which are large enough to survive ejection in a molecular cloud .",
    "thus these particles can survive ejection in any phase of the ism .",
    "the assignment of a given dust grain to a particular class depends not only on the particle size but also on the particle distance from the bss .",
    "figure [ ismejection ] shows the map of different classes in the @xmath83 space .",
    "note that particles satisfying the condition @xmath84 with @xmath85 defined in equation ( [ rgmine ] ) do not exhibit long - term dynamics on the oss as they get rapidly ejected by the electric force even in the coronal phase of the ism .",
    "for that reason we do not introduce a separate class for these small grains .",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath86 myr for the average time between passages through atomic clouds .",
    "this is roughly survival time , @xmath82 , of class a particles since these are ejected in passages through atomic or molecular clouds , but passages through molecular clouds happen on much longer , @xmath87 @xcite , timescales .",
    "we now study the decay in semi - major axis caused by the differential drag in the coronal and warm phases of the ism in between ejection events .",
    "we consider particles at @xmath88 au with @xmath89 g @xmath13 and @xmath90 , which corresponds to a grain radius @xmath91 for both the coronal and warm phases .",
    "the reason the grain radii are the same in different phases is because the electric force is the dominant perturbation in both cases , and we are assuming the particles are charged to the same potential of @xmath45 v. our choice of @xmath32 is close to the threshold indicated in the ejection criterion ( [ eq : ejsimple ] ) and is motivated by the fact that differential drag is most important for the smallest particles .    equation ( [ eq : simpledecay ] ) predicts roughly exponential decay of the particle orbit on some characteristic time scale @xmath92 . to evaluate upper and lower limits for @xmath93 , we calculate @xmath94 in equation ( [ decayconstant ] ) for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we can immediately rule out differential drag playing an important role in the coronal phase , since @xmath97 there , which is much longer than the @xmath86 myr interval between ejection events . on the other hand ,",
    "a similar calculation for the warm phase yields @xmath98 . since this is smaller than @xmath99 , the semi - major axes of some class a particles can decay by a factor of a few between ejection events .    to verify our estimate for @xmath93 in the warm phase , we perform monte carlo simulations of dust grain orbital evolution .",
    "we initialize particles to have a semi - major axis of @xmath7 , corresponding to the inner edge of the oort cloud where most of the dust should be concentrated . without good knowledge of what the distribution of the other orbital elements should be , we choose the eccentricities uniformly on the interval @xmath100 , and randomly orient the orbit in space .",
    "the perturbations included in the simulation on top of the gravitational attraction to the bss are the electric force , gas drag , and coulomb drag ; other perturbations forces are unimportant for particles of this size at this semimajor axis .",
    "we simulate @xmath3 orbits for @xmath86 myr assuming particle parameters adopted for class a ( see above ) . for each run",
    "we compute the average @xmath72 over the length of the simulation by finding a best exponential fit to the dependence of the semi - major axis on time . a typical example for the evolution of the semi - major axis of a particle having @xmath101 , but with a starting semi - major axis of @xmath102 rather than @xmath7",
    "is shown in figure [ decayfig]a .",
    "the reason for choosing @xmath102 for the starting semi - major axis is to highlight the rapid oscillations happening on an orbital timescale , the long oscillations occurring on a stark period timescale , and the steady decay due to differential drag .",
    "the resulting distribution of decay times , @xmath92 , is plotted in figure [ decayhist]a .",
    "we calculate from this distribution that the mean decay time for class a grains is @xmath103 myr with a standard deviation of @xmath104 myr .",
    "this agrees nicely with the analytical limits given above .",
    "furthermore , we see from equation ( [ decayconstant ] ) that the _ limits _ on @xmath93 do not depend on the semimajor axis .",
    "thus , as long as a grain is not eroded or destroyed in a collision , and the limits on @xmath93 are tight , @xmath72 will be approximately constant for a grain of a given size as it decays .",
    "of course , smaller and smaller particles become bound as the semimajor axis decreases , so for @xmath101 ( @xmath105 ) at @xmath106 au in the warm phase , the limits on @xmath93 are a mere @xmath107 , whereas at @xmath3 au for @xmath101 ( @xmath108 ) they are @xmath109 , substantially longer than the timescale between passages through atomic clouds .    the orbital decay of class a particles should lead to their preferential concentration at small radii , which may promote fragmentation of these grains in mutual collisions and the creation of even smaller debris particles closer to the sun .",
    "the implications of this effect are discussed in more detail in  [ satellites ] .",
    "class b comprises particles which are large enough to survive ejection in atomic clouds , but not in molecular clouds .",
    "the time between the solar system s passages through molecular clouds is about @xmath110 @xcite , so this is the survival time for class b dust grains .",
    "we take the parameters of a typical class b particle to be @xmath111 and @xmath112 , since such a particle would have @xmath101 in an atomic cloud at @xmath113 . prior to ejection in a molecular cloud",
    ", the particle will spend a fraction @xmath114 of its lifetime in atomic clouds , where @xmath115 is the filling fraction of these clouds , and a fraction @xmath116 of its lifetime in the warm and coronal phases combined , see table [ ismphases ] . for simplicity , we assume that the particle spends its time in either the warm phase or an atomic cloud before it is ejected would raise @xmath93 by approximately a factor of 2 because the decay in the coronal phase is negligible . ] .",
    "then , the characteristic decay time is @xmath117^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath118 is the value of the decay constant @xmath72 in the warm phase and @xmath119 is @xmath72 in atomic clouds . even though @xmath120 the contribution to the decay from atomic clouds is still important since the total drag in them is much larger than in the more dilute phases of the ism . setting as in  [ caseone ] @xmath121 and @xmath96 in equation ( [ decayconstant ] ) to get upper and lower bounds on the decay time we have @xmath122",
    "this is shorter than the @xmath123 myr time between passages through a molecular cloud , so the orbits of these particles can also decay appreciably before ejection occurs .",
    "we checked our analytical estimates by simulating @xmath3 particle orbits for @xmath110 initialized in the same way as in  [ caseone ] ( with class b particle parameters adopted here ) .",
    "we simulate the effect of passages through atomic clouds as stochastic events that happen on average every @xmath124 myr , so that there are on average 8 passages through atomic clouds per simulation , and the total time spent in atomic clouds per simulation is on average @xmath125 myr , consistent with @xmath126 .",
    "a typical example of the orbital evolution of a class b dust particle along with the best exponential fit is shown in figures [ decayfig]b , c .",
    "the distribution of decay times @xmath94 is shown in figure [ decayhist]b .",
    "the mean decay time for this simulation is @xmath127 myr with a standard deviation of @xmath128 myr in agreement with analytical estimates .",
    "note that the distributions of @xmath93 for class a and class b particles look quite different .",
    "this is because for class b there is an additional source of variance that is not present for class a : we model the passages through atomic clouds as stochastic events , and thus , although there are on average 8 cloud passages per simulation , the number and timing of passages in any given simulation do not have to be the same . as a result ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath93 for class b particles is closer to gaussian .",
    "we also give limits on @xmath93 for class b particles with starting semimajor axes at 300 au and @xmath3 au . for @xmath101 ( @xmath129 ) in an atomic cloud at @xmath106 au in an atomic cloud ( relevant for class b ) are almost same size as particles with @xmath90 at @xmath106 au in the warm phase ( relevant for class a ) comes from the fact that the electric force starts to dominate the total drag in both environments for particles of size @xmath130 , and we have assumed that particles are charged to @xmath45 volt in every environment . ] at @xmath106 au the decay time is @xmath131 , so transport is extremely important for these particles if they are not destroyed on even smaller timescales ( e.g. by collisions ) . on the other hand at @xmath3 au and @xmath101 ( @xmath132 ) ,",
    "the decay time is @xmath133 so transport is insignificant , since passages through molecular clouds happen on shorter timescales .",
    "class c particles survive passages through molecular clouds which implies that they have @xmath134 gyr , i.e. the age of the solar system . at @xmath7 a particle with @xmath135 and @xmath136",
    "has @xmath101 in a molecular cloud so we take these to be the parameters of a class c particle . using values for the filling fractions from table [ ismphases ] and the formula t_c , = ( _ i _ i f_i)^-1 , where the sum runs over the different phases of the ism , and @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the corresponding orbital decay constants and filling factors , the decay time is @xmath139 , which is considerably longer than @xmath82 .",
    "a particle with @xmath101 in a molecular cloud would need to have a semimajor axis of @xmath140 au for the decay time to equal the age of the solar system ( the size of such a particle would be @xmath141 ) .",
    "thus , beyond @xmath140 au , differential drag is unimportant for class c particles , and they should remain at essentially the same semi - major axis at which they were created .      @xcite has previously estimated the perturbing force on particles in the oort cloud . however , he only considered gas dynamical drag and neglected both the coulomb drag and the electric force .",
    "moreover , his estimates for the gas drag rely on the assumption that @xmath53 is much larger than the thermal velocity of the species in the wind , i.e. @xmath142 . from table [ ismphases ] we see that this assumption is questionable for the warm phase and incorrect for the coronal phase .    @xcite has also considered the importance of a passing shock from a nearby supernova for ejecting particles and has found that a supernova at 40 pc can eject particles of radius @xmath2 .",
    "assuming a local supernova rate of 0.02 yr@xmath11 , the average time between supernova explosions within 40 pc is @xmath143 .",
    "this is similar to the timescale for passages through atomic clouds , and because a typical class a particle has a radius of @xmath144 , the effect of supernova explosions is simply to reduce the average lifetime of the smaller class a particles by about a factor of two .",
    "finally , @xcite has pointed out that oort cloud objects should be eroded by high velocity impacts with interstellar grains .",
    "this is most relevant for class a grains since they will be eroded within @xmath145 , according to stern s estimates .",
    "thus it may be possible that these particles are eroded to the point of ejection before their semi - major axes can decay appreciably .",
    "however this statement is speculative , because the erosion rate is not well understood and depends on both the composition of the grains and their 3-dimensional structure .",
    "dust experiments on board the _ ulysses _ and _ galileo _ satellites have detected a significant flux of dust particles which appear to be co - moving with the ism flow through the solar system : within the experimental uncertainties , which are quite significant for ulysses ; particle speed can be determined with a @xmath146 accuracy of @xmath147 km s@xmath11 ( grun 1994 ) . ] , dust grain velocities agree both in direction and magnitude with @xmath148 .",
    "a surprising feature of this dust component is that it contains a significant fraction of large grains with masses in excess of @xmath149 g , i.e. above the upper cutoff of the standard mrn dust size distribution ( mathis 1977 ; weingartner & draine 2001 ) expected for the local ism @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that if these massive particles are pervasive throughout the ism , then ( 1 ) the mass locked up in these large grains may be inconsistent with the amount of refractory material potentially available for dust grain formation in the galaxy and , ( 2 ) even more importantly , the reddening curve calculated accounting for the large grain population is grossly inconsistent with observations .",
    "this essentially excludes the idea that large grains can be broadly spread through the galaxy in the amounts measured by the satellites . at the same time",
    ", it has proven to be difficult to identify a mechanism that would cause a concentration of such large grains even locally in the nearby ism ( draine 2008 ) .",
    "another possibility for the origin of massive grains is that they come from the oss , e.g. get produced in cometary collisions beyond the heliopause and become coupled to the ism flow .",
    "this possibility has been first proposed by @xcite , who dismissed it based on the supply argument : given the measured mass flux in large grains and assuming a typical radius of the dust production region ( @xmath150 au in @xcite ) the whole mass of the oort cloud @xmath151 would be ground down in collisions on a timescale [ oortlife ] t _",
    "~10 ^ 5 , where @xmath152 is their assumed value for the flux of interstellar dust grains .",
    "however it is unlikely that main dust production region in the oort cloud lies at @xmath4 au since the spatial distribution of comets is expected to be concentrated towards the cloud s inner edge , which may lie at 3000 au or possibly even closer @xcite . if the inner edge is indeed at 3000 au , this increases the estimate of the cloud lifetime to @xmath153 , but still does not reconcile it with the age of the solar system . for the dust particles detected by satellites to have the oort cloud origin and for the cloud to have a fragmentation timescale @xmath154 on",
    "the order of several gyr requires the small dust particles ( which get entrained in the ism wind ) to be mainly produced at distances of order @xmath155 au from the bss .",
    "our present study reveals two physical effects which may cause the concentration of intermediate size grains ( particles with sizes above the ejection threshold , which can produce dust grains with sizes below the ejection threshold in mutual collisions ) towards the inner solar system .",
    "the first effect is the secular variation of eccentricity in the stark problem ( see   [ subsect : stark_planar]-[subsect : stark_3d ] ) which in some cases leads to high values of @xmath156 and allows particles to venture closer to the bss .",
    "the second effect is the gradual decrease in the semi - major axes of grains caused by differential drag ( see  [ sect : orbdecay ] ) , which again makes it possible for grains to come closer to the bss .    to investigate whether these effects can reconcile the observed flux of large ism grains with their possible origin in the oort cloud it is necessary to nail down the location of the inner edge , construct a model of collisional evolution of the cloud , investigate the transport of ejected small particles towards the inner solar system , and so on .",
    "given the complexity of associated modeling we do not pursue this effort here , leaving it for future investigation .",
    "such a study may potentially set useful limits on the amount of dust material that is arriving into the inner solar system from the oort cloud .",
    "its results will also be relevant for interpreting observations of interstellar meteoroids ( sizes below @xmath157 ) detected in radar observations @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of dust particles with sizes between @xmath158 m and several meters in the outer solar system subject to the effects of the flow of interstellar gas beyond the heliopause .",
    "we analyzed various forces affecting the motion of small particles and showed that the electromagnetic force can be quite important for dust dynamics : the electric field induced in the solar system frame by the magnetic field carried with the ism flow can be the main determinant of the dynamics of dust particles which are bound to the solar system .",
    "the magnetic force is important for motion of small particles which get ejected from the solar system .",
    "these statements are true in particular for particles smaller than @xmath157 interacting with the warm phase of the ism through which the solar system is currently passing",
    ". drag forces  coulomb drag against the ionized component of the ism flow and gas drag  are crucial for dust dynamics while the solar system is passing through molecular or atomic clouds .",
    "radiation forces are never important for the dynamics of dust particles bigger than a micron in size outside of the heliosphere .",
    "we have demonstrated that the effect of these non - gravitational forces can be well - described by the classical stark problem , and have studied the ejection conditions for dust grains using the approach based on the kustaanheimo - stiefel transformation . based on these results , we determined the particle sizes and semi - major axes at which they are ejected from the solar system in different ism phases .",
    "rare passages through molecular clouds can eject particles as large as 1 m if they were originally located at @xmath3 au from the bss .",
    "we have also explored the motion of bigger , bound grains using a perturbative approach based on orbit - averaging the non - keplerian part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a complete analytical description of the system on timescales longer than an orbital period .",
    "we have shown , in particular , that the eccentricity of dust particles oscillates in a regular fashion reaching high levels in some circumstances and allowing dust grains to explore radii much smaller than their semi - major axes .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the component of the drag force which depends on particle velocity causes the decay of particle orbits , and this may be an important effect for small grains .",
    "finally , we have discussed the possible relevance of these dynamical effects for the origin of big grains recently discovered by the _",
    "ulysses _ and _ galileo _ satellites , which appear to be flowing into the solar system with the ism gas .",

    "our study until now has explicitly assumed that the stark force is constant both in space and time , which in practice means that all our results are valid if @xmath37 does not vary on timescales shorter than @xmath159 .",
    "we now briefly discuss whether the particle semi - major axis can vary in a systematic fashion if we abandon the assumption of constant @xmath37 .",
    "we have previously assumed that a particle s charge is fixed over its orbit .",
    "however , one may expect the charge to vary as a function of distance from the sun @xcite because of increased exposure to ionizing radiation at smaller radii .",
    "then even if the direction and magnitude of the induced electric field are constant , the magnitude of the electric force and the coulomb drag force will still vary as functions of distance from the sun due to the radial dependence of the grain charge .    to investigate what effect a radially - dependent charge has on the orbit",
    ", we allow the grain charge @xmath160 to vary according to a simple prescription @xmath161,\\ ] ] where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are constants .",
    "thus , the charge tends to @xmath162 for @xmath164 and increases slowly as the grain approaches the sun .",
    "we simulate the effect of grain charging numerically and choose @xmath163 to be the starting semi - major axis of the grain and @xmath162 such that the grain is charged to 1 v at infinity .",
    "as shown in figure [ graincharging ] we find that although grain charging does lead to a systematic change in the semi - major axis on an orbital timescale , the changes are periodic on a timescale of order @xmath63 and on average the semi - major axis stays constant .",
    "this is because radially - dependent grain charging does no work on a particle over a closed stark orbit and can not affect its semi - major axis in a systematic way .",
    "if we allow the stark vector to vary in magnitude and in time , it will no longer be true that the semi - major axis or the energy of the orbit are conserved .",
    "however , if the timescale on which @xmath37 varies is long compared to the orbital period @xmath165 , then adiabatic invariance arguments suggest that the semi - major axis should not vary in a systematic fashion . indeed , the classical stark problem is separable in parabolic coordinates @xcite and admits three adiabatic invariants ( banks & leopold 1978 ) which are conserved when @xmath37 varies slowly .",
    "the energy of a particle can be expressed as a function of these invariants and the value of @xmath37 , meaning that as the ambient magnetic field and wind velocity slowly change their magnitude and direction around some mean values , the semi - major axis will simply oscillate around its mean value as well .    at the opposite extreme",
    ", @xmath37 may have a stochastic component which varies rapidly on timescales shorter than @xmath165 , e.g. due to the small scale magnetic turbulence or random charge fluctuations on the grain . in this case",
    "we expect a random walk - like evolution of the semi - major axis to take place even if the stochastic component of @xmath37 averages to zero",
    ". a similar effect of a random walk in the semi - major axes of comets caused by random stellar passages through the oss has been previously explored in heisler & tremaine ( 1986 ) .",
    "the resulting diffusion of the initial distribution of particle semi - major axes will bring some particles to smaller @xmath8 and make them more gravitationally bound ; others will move to higher @xmath8 , and possibly become unbound .",
    "we expect the smallest bound dust grains with large initial semi - major axes to be most affected by diffusive evolution from a rapidly fluctuating stark vector .",
    "we do not attempt to model the random walk evolution here because of the large uncertainties in the input ingredients that such a model will involve : spectrum and strength of magnetic turbulence , random fluctuations of the grain charge , etc .",
    "we leave this subject for future investigation .",
    "we do point out , though , that diffusion caused by a rapidly fluctuating stark vector would add on top of diffusion caused by random stellar perturbations .",
    "@xcite have performed simulations which include the effects of stellar perturbations and have found that diffusion is ineffecient inside of @xmath3 au ; only @xmath166 of objects having @xmath167 au arrived there by diffusion from initial orbits having @xmath168 au after a time of 4.5 gyr .",
    "thus , diffusion caused by stellar perturbations alone will not cause significant transport in semimajor axis at the inner edge of the oort cloud , where most of the dust is likely to be concentrated .",
    "to understand the ejection conditions in the stark problem , we use the analytical results of kirchgraber ( 1971 ) and dankowicz ( 1994 ) which rely on the use of ks transformation proposed by kustaanheimo & stiefel ( 1965 ) .",
    "this transformation relates six components of the 3-dimensional cartesian coordinates @xmath169 and velocities @xmath170 to 8 components of 4-dimensional generalized coordinate vector @xmath171 and velocity @xmath172 via a non - linear prescription , see e.g. kirchgraber ( 1971 ) . upon transformation to ks variables , the standard keplerian problem reduces to the problem of harmonic oscillator motion in four dimensions , which is easier to treat in some cases .",
    "one can show that whenever the physical distance @xmath190 becomes infinite ( the particle is unbound ) , the coordinate @xmath173 also becomes infinite ( the opposite is also true ",
    "finite @xmath173 corresponds to finite @xmath190 ) , which makes finiteness of @xmath173 an indicator of the boundedness of particle .",
    "for this reason we only need to determine under which conditions there exist bound states for zero - energy motion in the potential @xmath191  their existence and particle location in one of these states would be equivalent to it being bound .    for the problem of motion in a cubic potential represented by equations ( [ eq : genpot])-([eq : pot ] ) at @xmath192 ( only positive @xmath173 is physically interesting )",
    "bound states appear whenever @xmath191 has 3 roots all of which are positive  then there is a valley in the potential curve in which the motion is bound .",
    "this is possible if the two extrema of @xmath191 , a minimum and a maximum occur at non - negative @xmath193 and @xmath194 , and @xmath195 while @xmath196 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath197 .",
    "\\label{eq : rpm}\\ ] ]    to be in the valley , the particle also needs to have @xmath198 .",
    "thus , a particle is _ bound _ if and only if for given @xmath199 we have @xmath200 in practice , for given @xmath199 one needs to ( 1 ) calculate the constants @xmath201 using equations ( [ eq : j])-([eq : h ] ) , ( 2 ) calculate @xmath193 and @xmath194 using equation ( [ eq : rpm ] ) , and ( 3 ) check whether all of the conditions ( [ eq : bound ] ) are satisfied",
    ". if they are , then the motion is bound , but if at least one of them is violated then the motion is _",
    "unbound_.    we can directly use equations ( [ eq : pot ] ) - ( [ eq : h ] ) to find the ejection criterion for particles with zero initial velocity , @xmath202 . in this case , the constants of the motion are @xmath203/16r^0 , ~ h = ( sx_1 ^ 0+gm / r^0)/2 $ ] . setting @xmath204 to find the turning points of the motion and solving the resulting quadratic equation for @xmath173 , the condition for ejection becomes @xmath205 .",
    "since the initial semi - major axis @xmath206 in the zero velocity case , ejection must occur for @xmath207 , as given by equation ( [ eq : ejsimple ] ) .",
    "to assist our study of orbital motion , we have written an integrator based on burdett - heggie ( bh ) regularization .",
    "we start from the bh regularized equation of motion @xcite @xmath208 where @xmath209 , @xmath210 is the eccentricity vector , @xmath211 is the energy of the orbit , and @xmath212 is the perturbing force , which need not be small .",
    "we implement equation ( [ regularized ] ) in a manner similar to leapfrog @xcite , so our algorithm consists of a series of @xmath213 steps , where @xmath214 denotes a full kick step and @xmath215 denotes a half drift step .",
    "each drift step corresponds to analytically integrating equation ( [ regularized ] ) without the perturbing forces for a duration of regularized time @xmath216 , and thus is simply the solution to an initial value problem for a forced harmonic oscillator .",
    "each kick step is then simply an instantaneous application of the perturbing forces .",
    "our algorithm bears a similarity to the wisdom - holman integrator @xcite , and in particular to the ks regularized wisdom - holman integrator of @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also devised a class of algorithms with an adaptive timestep for separable hamiltonians , and the integrator in this class which has a timestep proportional to @xmath217 , the same as regularization , follows a keplerian orbit exactly except for errors in the phase .",
    "the reason for developing a new algorithm is so that we can easily treat the magnetic force on particles .",
    "although we have found that the magnetic force is dynamically unimportant for bound particles , because it is much smaller than the electric force , it is important for ejected particles , and a future study of the trajectories of these particles would need to include this force .",
    "this rules out the algorithm of @xcite , since the hamiltonian is no longer separable in the presence of a magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", it should be possible to modify the algorithm of @xcite to include magnetic fields , but because both time and space coordinates are changed in ks regularization , whereas only the time coordinate is changed in bh regularization , it is simpler to treat magnetic fields using bh rather than ks regularization .",
    "for this reason we have decided to write our own algorithm rather than modifying the one of @xcite .",
    "one possible second order discretization for the update of the ( unregularized ) velocity during the kick step is @xmath218 where @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the velocities right before and right after the kick step , and the magnitude of @xmath221 is given by equation ( its direction is of course opposite to the sum of orbital and wind velocities ) . because the kick step is assumed to happen instantaneously",
    ", @xmath190 is constant during the kick step , and we can convert between the unregularized velocity @xmath222 , and the regularized velocity @xmath223 using the simple transformation @xmath224 .",
    "one complication with implementing equation ( [ vadvance ] ) is that it is implicit since @xmath220 appears on the right hand side .",
    "however , in the case of a pure electromagnetic force with no drag , equation ( [ vadvance ] ) can be inverted to obtain an explicit scheme for the particle advance .",
    "this is known as boris s algorithm and is widely used in particle in cell simulations of plasmas @xcite .",
    "the kick step of boris s algorithm can be represented as @xmath225 , where @xmath226 represents half of an electric acceleration step , and @xmath227 is a full magnetic rotation step .",
    "this algorithm is explicit , second order , time - reversible , and conserves energy .    rather than solving the implicit equation ( [ vadvance ] ) ,",
    "we extend boris s algorithm to include the drag force by writing @xmath228 , where @xmath229 is half of a drag acceleration step .",
    "such an algorithm is entirely explicit , and in the case where the drag force does not depend on the particle velocity , the expression for the kick step above is identical to boris s algorithm with the substitution @xmath230 .",
    "this is not true in the general case for which the drag force can depend on the orbital velocity , so we must test our algorithm to make sure that it gives reliable results .",
    "the first test we perform is the planar stark problem , so there is a constant perturbing force in the plane of the orbit .",
    "the performance of a variety of modified wisdom - holman integrators on this problem has been studied by @xcite .",
    "they found that for the energy error to be bounded , the pericenter passage must be resolved . since the pericenter passage lasts for a time @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the radius at pericenter , regularized integrators with a timestep @xmath233 , performed better than unregularized ones , when the eccentricity approached unity .",
    "we compare the performance of our algorithm with that of an unregularized wisdom - holman integrator and find that it is much better at conserving energy for highly eccentric orbits ( figure [ energycomparison ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is the much finer resolution of our algorithm when passing close to the force center , which can be seen in figure [ orbitcomparison ] .",
    "we also test that our algorithm can capture the effects of differential drag by making sure that the solutions it gives are accurate and converged . to test convergence ,",
    "we study the decay rate of a class a particle (  [ caseone ] ) with varying resolution .",
    "we find that the change in the decay constant from 50 to 1000 timesteps per orbit is less than a tenth of a percent .",
    "because we typically use around 1000 timesteps per orbit , we can confidently say that we are able to resolve the decay due to differential drag .    to test that the code gives not only",
    "a converged , but also an accurate result for the decay , we compare its results against analytical estimates for stationary orbits  [ subsect : stark_3d ] . in that case",
    "we can precisely evaluate the factor @xmath72 in equation ( [ decayconstant ] ) as a function of @xmath234 . orienting the stark vector along the z - axis we have the relations @xmath235 and @xmath236 , which we can use together with equation ( [ eq : c^2 ] ) and @xmath237 to obtain @xmath238 from this relation for @xmath60 and definition ( [ decayconstant ] ) , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath239 and compare this with @xmath239 from simulations integrated for one stark period for pure gas drag and pure coulomb drag .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ stationarydecayfig ] and show that the simulations give not only a converged but also an accurate result for the differential drag ."
