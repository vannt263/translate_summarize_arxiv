    "system response to parametric variations or perturbations is of great importance . it is a powerful experimental practice from which new information about a system can be extracted that is not generally available by other means , especially for complex systems , i.e.  disordered , interacting many - body , and/or simple chaotic systems .",

    "the response of integrable or near - integrable systems is far richer being system dependent , and the husimi distributions of the eigenstates are confined to classical tori  @xcite .",
    "a perturbation is likely to give rise to subsets of eigenlevels / states that respond very similarly as a group , and the parametric quantities thereby carry far more information .",
    "for mixed systems both regular and chaotic trajectories form phase space structures and the most obvious , naive initial starting point would be to attempt to analyze each structure separately . at this level of approximation ,",
    "using the appropriate semiclassical theory for regular and chaotic regions involves the respective integrable and chaotic hannay - ozorio de almeida sum rule expressions  @xcite weighted by the relative fractions of phase space volume .",
    "we find instead that the intermittent behavior of the unstable orbits prevents this simple picture from applying .",
    "a measure was introduced by one of us ( s.t . )",
    "@xcite that reveals phase space localization of quantum eigenstates .",
    "originally introduced for chaotic systems , the measure correlates the changes in the eigenenergies due to a perturbation ( termed `` level velocities '' ) with the overlap intensities between the eigenstates and a probe state , which is often usefully chosen to be a coherent state .",
    "more recently , it has been identified as contributing to the scale associated with the fidelity in the weak perturbative regime  @xcite . for",
    "integrable systems phase space localization is the norm , not the exception .",
    "there and in the near - integrable regime , the localization is associated with tori , resonance zones and stable periodic orbits .",

    "several years ago weissman and jortner  @xcite performed a similar study involving the husimi distributions and parametric changes in eigenenergy levels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we begin by developing the semiclassical theory of the correlations for near - integrable systems where we also remark on the more general theory for the level velocities in mixed systems .",

    "this ensures that the eigenvalues do not collectively drift in some direction in energy , but rather wander locally .",

    "ahead @xmath10 will denote the smooth part resulting from the fourier transform of just the extremely rapid initial decay due to the shortest time scale of the dynamics ( zero - length trajectories ) .",
    "we will take @xmath9 to be a gaussian wave packet because of its ability to probe ` quantum phase space ' , but other choices may be useful depending on the circumstances . in one spectroscopic application , we found it to be advantageous to take @xmath9 as a momentum state  @xcite .",
    "the overlap intensity - level velocity correlation coefficient is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the local variances of intensities and level velocities , respectively .",
    "the brackets denote a local energy average in the neighborhood of @xmath14 .",
    "it weights most the level velocities whose associated eigenstates possibly share common localization characteristics and measures the tendency of these levels to move in a common direction . in this expression ,",
    "the phase space volume remains constant so that the level velocities are zero centered ( otherwise the mean must be subtracted ) , and @xmath15 is rescaled to a unitless quantity with unit variance making it a true correlation coefficient .",
    "the set of states included in the local energy averaging can be left flexible except for a few constraints . only energies where @xmath10 is roughly a constant can be used or some intensity unfolding must be applied .",
    "the energy range must be small so that the classical dynamics are essentially the same throughout the range , but it must also be broad enough to include enough eigenstates for statistical purposes .",
    "we develop a theory based upon semiclassical dynamics for the overlap correlation coefficient of regular states by examining its individual components , the level velocities and intensities . the theory for the variance of the level velocities involves the trace formula for near - integrable systems developed by ullmo , grinberg and tomsovic  @xcite .",
    "the near - integrable trace formula is used rather than the simpler integrable trace formula of berry and tabor  @xcite since it correctly describes the contributions of short , unstable periodic orbits that occur after a system breaks integrability .",

    "the only exceptional cases are the tori at @xmath157 and @xmath158 which happen to be self - symmetric and on the lowest order resonances . whereas for @xmath135",

    "the covariance between the intensities and level velocities is given by eq .",

    "the covariance and correlation is strongest for resonance zones ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : correlation_near_standardmap ] and ref .  @xcite .",
    "the quantizing tori are deforming at a greater rate inside the resonance while the tori outside the resonance are only slightly perturbed .",
    "thus , the associated level velocities are larger for this area of phase space .",
    "also , note that there is a dip in the correlation near the stable periodic orbit at the center of the resonance zone .",
    "the dip is only present in the correlation and not in the covariance .",

    "the intensity variance is divided by the winding numbers , eq .",

    "we have derived semiclassical expressions of the correlation of level velocities and overlap intensities in near - integrable systems .",
    "their @xmath0-scaling is very different than previously derived in the chaotic limit  @xcite where the level velocity variance is @xmath161 and the intensity variance  @xcite is @xmath162 in addition , for chaotic systems the action derivatives will eventually decouple from the weightings in the correlation so that in the semiclassical limit the random matrix theory prediction is recovered stating that no correlations exist  @xcite . on the other hand , for finite @xmath0 with the average computed up to the heisenberg time , there is a possibility of short orbits that do not decouple in chaotic systems , so correlations may exist . for near - integrable systems",
    "there is no decoupling even in the long time limit .    combining the previously derived results in chaotic systems with the newly derived results for near - integrable systems , for mixed phase space systems we attempted to separate the orbits for applying the hannay - ozorio de almeida sum rule to the different regions of phase space .",
    "several criteria were chosen as a basis for the separation .",
    "all of them led to inconsistencies in the interpretation .",
    "it seems that all of the unstable orbits spend some part of their evolution mimicking stable motion and do not give standard diffusion contributions to action derivatives .",
    "nevertheless , a different semiclassical procedure  @xcite , not going through the hannay - ozorio sum rule derivation , gives a theoretical prediction that matches well with the level velocity variances independently of the dynamical regime of the system .",
    "finally , the correlation between the level velocities and the intensities has been shown to highlight resonance zones in near - integrable systems .",
    "the resonance zones exhibit greater localization since the motion is bounded within the separatrix . investigating the correlation and covariance separably may yield more information about the system .",
    "an example is the dip in the correlation that occurs near the center of the resonance zone due to the stable periodic orbit ; the dip is not present in the covariance .",
