    "the mechanism for supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking is an open topic . due to the tree - level sum rule for the susy - breaking spectrum , namely the supertrace theorem ,",
    "susy must be broken ( spontaneously ) in the hidden sector  @xcite .",
    "then how to mediate the susy - breaking effects to the visible sector is a crucial issue .",
    "so far several schemes have been proposed , among which the gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) is a quite promising approach because it can automatically avoid the notorious flavor problem  @xcite ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the direct gauge mediation has recently attracted much attention , in which the messengers play a role in determining the susy - breaking vacua  @xcite .",
    "however , this attractive approach easily suffers from some problems , for example , the suppressed gaugino mass problem  @xcite , the landau pole problem , and the fine - tuning problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the indirect gauge mediation usually does not have the gaugino mass problem but it has a demerit of adding messengers by hand . a recent study on such messenger gauge mediation",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "no matter direct or indirect gauge mediation , the messenger fields @xmath0 must carry the susy - breaking information in a form of the mass splittings ( @xmath1 ) between the fermionic and bosonic components which are degenerate in a susy - preserved theory . but how the messengers obtain such mass splittings is unknown , and in the previous studies a singlet @xmath2 is simply introduced as the susy - breaking source which couples directly with the messengers .",
    "this is the so - called minimal gauge mediation ( mgm ) and has been widely considered in phenomenology .",
    "note that such a simplification in mgm may hide some questions , for instance , why the messengers have to couple directly with @xmath3 to obtain mass splitting ? in principle , the mass splitting can be achieved in a cascade way , _",
    "i.e. _ , some primary messengers @xmath4 ( neutral under the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath5 ) mediate the susy - breaking to some secondary messengers @xmath6 via the hidden sector gauge interaction with a gauge group @xmath7 or yukawa interaction , and this dynamical process can be successive if necessary , until finally mediate the susy - breaking to the visible sector . in this paper",
    ", we assume the simplest cascade patten , _",
    "i.e. _ , the two - step cascade mediation , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ cascade ] .",
    "in fact , such a two - step cascade mediation via pure gauge interaction is nothing but the semi - direct gauge mediation studied intensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "however , the similar mediation mechanism with additional yukawa interaction has not been studied , which will be examined in this article .",
    "the conventional semi - direct gauge mediation suffers massless gaugino mass problem , since the secondary messengers does not acquire holomorphic soft terms  @xcite .",
    "however , with yukwa - assisted mediation , the holomorphic soft terms arise at one loop , thus gauginos can indeed become massive .",
    "we shall show that a calculable cascade susy - breaking with the minimal khler potential , based on a very general setup , is viable only when both gauge and yukawa interactions are turned on .",
    "namely , this hybrid cascade gauge - yukawa mediation ( hcgym ) can provide the viable susy particle spectra in some cases .",
    "the crucial point is the presence of non - vanishing supertrace in the messenger sector which links to the visible sector and modifies the sfermion masses drastically .",
    "note that our cascade scenario has one essential difference from the gauge mediation with messenger sector added by hand , _",
    "i.e. _ , our scenario can be naturally realized dynamically such as in the intriligator - seiberg - shih ( iss)-like models  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the messengers in our scenario are a natural part in the hidden sector which breaks susy .",
    "we simply take a different way to gauge the so - called global flavor symmetry in the hidden sector .",
    "however , in our study we will start from a class of weakly coupled effective oraifeartaigh ( or ) models , characterized by cubic terms and some large global symmetry @xmath8 ( some will be gauged properly ) , without any elaboration on their dynamical realization .     a schematic diagram showing the structure of the two - step hcgym.,width=576 ]    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we propose a general framework for hcgym and then calculate the susy breaking soft terms via the secondary messengers .",
    "our calculations will be performed explicitly in a very general setup . in section iii",
    "we analyze in what conditions the realistic soft masses in the visible sector can be achieved , and comment on the possible general features of the hcgym .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusion are given in section iv .",
    "first we focus on susy breaking mediation without specifying any concrete model .",
    "generally , a cascade mediation via gauge and yukawa ( hyprid ) interactions has a typical structure as follows    * a hidden sector , which breaks susy , is composed of goldstino superfield @xmath3 and the primary vector - like messenger fields @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the gauge / flavor index of the hidden sector group @xmath7 like @xmath11 . * the secondary messenger fields @xmath12 , which are charged under @xmath7 and the sm gauge group , and the vector - like fields @xmath13 , which only carry the sm quantum numbers , both have supersymmetic mass terms and obtain susy - breaking effects via the interaction with the hidden gauge fields as well as from the cubic yukawa coupling terms ( discussed below ) .",
    "* some cubic terms must be present , which couple one primary and one secondary messenger fields with the sm vector - like fields , or couple the two secondary messengers with one primary messenger .",
    "however , the cubic terms with two primary fields are not allowed by the sm gauge invariance . note",
    "that if we turn off these cubic terms , the hidden sector susy - breaking will not be affected due to the fact that the secondary messengers are not relevant to the susy - breaking dynamics although they couple with the hidden sector .",
    "then our scenario will just be reduced to the semi - direct gauge mediation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we stress that our scenario is significantly different from the semi - direct gauge mediation  @xcite . the semi - direct gauge mediation @xcite interpolates the mgm and the direct gauge mediation .",
    "it introduces a messenger sector that does not affect the susy - breaking and does not have to couple with @xmath3 .",
    "however , it uses the messenger sector to probe the hidden sector only via some hidden gauge interactions . in our approach ,",
    "the direct renormalizable couplings in the superpotential play a central role . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum of the secondary messengers and also the visible fields is modified greatly .",
    "the presence of such cubic terms can arise in dynamical models , and , moreover , the mass scale can be dynamically determined . in other words ,",
    "our framework regards the messenger sector as a built - in part of the dynamical model building , rather than introduced by hand .    with the above general setup",
    ", we propose to use the effective or model which shows the dynamical structure . in our convention",
    ", we choose a basis in which the light messengers are diagonal while the hidden sector takes a general form @xmath14 \\cr & + \\l\\lambda_{a}\\phi_{ai}\\bar f^if+\\bar{\\lambda}_{a}\\bar\\phi_{a}^i f_i\\bar f\\r+\\l m_ff_i\\bar f^i+m_ff\\bar f\\r.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the index @xmath15 does not refer to any symmetry and we require @xmath16 , which is defined as the typical mass scale in the hidden sector , while @xmath17 determines the susy - breaking scale .",
    "note that the multiple pairs of secondary messengers have additive contributions and thus do not change our conclusion . by the way",
    ", we may embed the sm gauge group into the group @xmath7 and then it induces the massless gaugino mass problem @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the supersymmetric mass matrix for the hidden sector messenger .",
    "note that our general setup can be equipped with the @xmath20-symmetry . with the @xmath20-symmetry our framework can be considered as a generalization of the ( extra)ordinary gmsb  @xcite with the cubic terms and the extra gauge group @xmath7 .",
    "then the particle charges under @xmath21symmetry are @xmath22 to make gauginos massive , @xmath21symmetry must be broken . here",
    ", we will not scrutinize the @xmath21symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "instead , we simply assume it can be realized by @xmath23",
    ". this can be achieved by introducing some proper structures in the hidden sector , leading to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath21symmetry radiatively  @xcite or at the tree - level  @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss the susy - breaking encoded in the secondary messengers . they feel the susy - breaking effects through the following ways .",
    "one is through the conventional gauge mediation at two - loop level , of the non - holomorphic form such as @xmath24 ( because @xmath25 and @xmath26 are similar , for simplicity , we will only focus on the former . ) .",
    "they also receive the direct one - loop contributions from the yukawa couplings , which are calculated explicitly in appendix  [ 2 ] .",
    "moreover , there are two - loop contributions , which are @xmath27 and can be extracted using the wave function renormalization method  @xcite . in short ,",
    "these three terms are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the gauge coupling of @xmath7 and its value will be constrained by phenomenology .",
    "the explicit expressions of @xmath30 functions are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqna ] ) , ( [ eqnb ] ) , and ( [ eqnc ] ) .",
    "such terms enter into the diagonal elements of the bosonic components of the secondary messengers , and behave as the @xmath31term susy - breaking . in additional to the non - holomorphic terms , the other soft terms are holomorphic terms , namely @xmath32 , which is generated at one - loop level due to the yukawa interaction and proportional to the secondary messenger masses @xmath33 where we have set @xmath34 .",
    "this term contributes to the non - diagonal mass terms of the secondary messengers and acts as the conventional @xmath35term susy - breaking .",
    "it is absent in conventional semi - direct gauge mediation , rendering gaugino massless at the leading order of susy - breaking .",
    "a comment is in order . for the sdgm",
    "there is a robust gaugino screen theorem @xcite .",
    "it is derived through the renormalization of the real physical superfield @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the holomorphic gauge coupling that runs only at one - loop and @xmath38 runs over light fields at scale @xmath39 .",
    "the screening depends heavily on the replacement @xmath40 after across all messenger scales , leading to @xmath41 independent on @xmath3 at leading order .",
    "however , just like the analysis in @xcite which introduced chiral messengers so that the two chiralities of the messengers have different wave functions and thus invalidate the replacement , in our case the chiral yukawa coupling between the secondary and primary messengers can also invalidate the replacement .",
    "consequently , the screening is avoided .    by the way , in our framework we assume that @xmath7 is not higgsed .",
    "if it is higgsed , the gauge mediation has some modification and the modification extent is controlled by a new parameter @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the vector boson mass scale  @xcite .",
    "when it tends to be zero , we have the complete gauge group , while , oppositely , we have no gauge symmetry at the messenger scale .",
    "a sufficiently high @xmath43 is not a desired case and the reason will be discussed in the following .      in the above",
    "we have studied the susy - breaking mediated to the secondary messengers by hybrid mediation .",
    "now we calculate the susy - breaking mediated to the visible sector by the conventional gmsb . in contrast to the simple gmsb model where the hidden sector messenger spectrum has a vanishing supertrace , in our cascade framework the supertrace is nonzero due to the radiative corrections which are essentially from the holomorphic soft mass term @xmath44 . in the basis @xmath45 , the mass matrix of the scalar component is @xmath46 where @xmath47 can be effectively treated as a spurion superfield @xmath3 which has a vanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for the lowest component but has a non - zero @xmath48 component . from this point of view",
    ", our framework provides a natural realization of multi - spurion fields , which will be helpful to implement general gauge mediation  @xcite . the term @xmath49 measures the supertrace",
    "it has deep implication in the soft masses in the visible sector .",
    "the explicit calculations have been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we use their results to calculate the soft masses of gauginos and sfermions .    in the limit of small susy - breaking @xmath50 , the generic sfermion mass sqaure is approximately given by @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the dykin index of @xmath53 related to the three sm gauge groups .",
    "@xmath54 is the ultraviolet cutoff scale related to a high scale at which @xmath55 and @xmath25 are generated , which , in fact , is the primary messenger scale @xmath56 .",
    "this logarithmic uv - dependence is a character of the cascade gauge mediation . as for the gaugino masses",
    ", the @xmath31type contribution does not affect their masses significantly , and thus they take a conventional form @xmath57 now some comments are due regarding the property of the soft masses in the presence of @xmath31type contribution .",
    "> from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) we obtain @xmath58 so , depending on the sign of @xmath55 , the sfermion mass square can be either enhanced ( @xmath59 ) or reduced ( @xmath60 ) . as calculated in the previous section , there are several sources of non - holomorphic terms , and in the following we will show that a pure yukawa cascade model is not viable practically .    first , in the cascade gauge mediation , a contribution from pure gauge interaction is necessary . in the limit @xmath61 ,",
    "generically the one - loop effect is dominant and scales as ( the index @xmath15 will be dropped for simplicity ) @xmath62 we will find that the sign is not predicted uniquely but dependent on the parameters in the hidden sector . on the other hand , the holomorphic term sales as @xmath63 which is suppressed by the light supersymmetic mass term of the secondary messengers .",
    "then we find that the @xmath31type contribution dominates over the sfermion mass term .",
    "concretely , in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) the second term is about @xmath64 times larger than the first term which is at the same order of gaugino mass . as a result",
    ", it leads to a splitting spectrum , which will incur large fine - tuning in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the above conclusion is obtained only when the holomorphic and non - holomorphic susy - breaking terms are generated at the same loop level .",
    "we note that in some cases the two - loop contributions can dominate over the one - loop contributions which is suppressed by higher order of susy - breaking @xmath65 due to some subtle cancellation  @xcite .",
    "this happens when the hidden sector essentially contains only one mass scale @xmath66 which is irrelevant to the yukawa couplings between @xmath0 and @xmath3 , as in the minimal gmsb with @xmath3 being the spurion field . in our model",
    ", this is approximately satisfied in the limit @xmath67 , but , unfortunately , a realistic spectrum can not be obtained . in fact , the @xmath31type contribution scales as @xmath68 then the sfermion mass is given by @xmath69\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is always negative and unacceptable since it breaks the sm gauge group @xmath5 at the messenger scale .",
    "now we consider the second limit @xmath70 with a nonzero @xmath29 . in this case",
    "we recover the conventional semi - direct gauge mediation scenario .",
    "the study in ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , independent of the details of the hidden sector , the doubly charged messengers do not acquire @xmath35type susy - breaking information from it and thus the gaugino mass vanishes at the leading order ( gaugino screening ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite some complicated chiral messener fields are proposed to overcome this difficulty . in our hcgym approach",
    "we try to solve this by turning on the yukawa couplings .    in our hcgym scenario , we find that for a proper value of @xmath71 , the sfermion mass square can be reduced as a result of non - vanishing supertrace .",
    "the sfermion masses receive a @xmath31type contribution as @xmath72 therefore , for @xmath73 , there exists cancellation between the gauge and yukawa contributions .",
    "this @xmath31type contributions approximately vanishes and the sparticle spectrum reduces to the mgm case when @xmath74 in fact , we can tune the couplings to obtain our required soft masses .",
    "note that the reduced sfermion spectrum generically requires a tuning of the ratio @xmath75 , which arises from the cancellation between the one - loop effect ( @xmath76 ) and the two - loop effect ( @xmath77 ) . by the way",
    ", increasing @xmath78 helps to lower the value of @xmath29 , which , however , may induce the landau pole for @xmath79 gauge coupling .",
    "if the two - loop yukawa corrections are dominant , different results will be obtained . then the @xmath31type contribution is @xmath80 due to the fact that both @xmath31 and @xmath35type contributions come from the two - loop level , they have the same sign and the additional gauge contribution makes the sfermion mass quite large ( negative ) .",
    "our above analysis is just a rough estimation . in the next subsection",
    "we will give a concrete example and perform the numerical calculations to show that our framework indeed works .      to show that our hcgym scenario can satisfy the required property , we now study numerically a concrete example .",
    "for this simple example the superpotential is assumed to be @xmath81 where @xmath3 is regarded as the spurion superfield , both @xmath82 and @xmath45 belong to the fundamental representation of the hidden gauge group @xmath11 while @xmath83 is neutral .",
    "we set @xmath84 with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "then we get the @xmath55 and @xmath25 terms as @xmath88 another messenger pair @xmath83 also obtain soft @xmath55- and @xmath25-type corrections which are enhanced by a group factor @xmath78 , but receive no corresponding gauge contribution since they are charged under @xmath5 only . with all these contributions , from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) we find that for the sfermion masses the @xmath31type contribution and @xmath35type contribution has a ratio : @xmath89 note that this result is independent of @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] we plot this ratio as a function of @xmath29 ( setting @xmath91 ) .",

    "another more natural model can be found in ref .",

    "( [ mag ] ) it can be clearly seen that the hidden sector susy - breaking effect mediated by gauge and yukawa interactions to the secondary messengers indeed appear in the model .",
    "of course , it is not a realistic model since the @xmath21symmetry is not broken . to make it realistic , further modifications in the hidden sector are required , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we proposed a pattern of cascade gauge - yukawa mediation of susy - breaking based on an explicit feynman diagram calculations for the soft mass terms .",
    "we found that the realistic soft masses for gauginos and sfermions can be obtained in the case that the conventional messenger fields obtain the susy - breaking effects through gauge and yukawa interactions with the hidden sector .",

    "<S> we propose semi - direct gauge - yukawa mediation of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the messenger fields mediating susy breaking to the visible sector do not directly couple with the goldstino field , and instead they have gauge and yukawa interactions with some primary messenger fields which couple directly with the goldstino fields . from the explicit feynman diagram calculations for the susy breaking soft masses , we find that the susy particle spectra can be realistic . </S>",
    "<S> especially , this generalization of semi - direct gauge mediation solves the massless gaugino mass problem since the holomorphic soft mass terms of the messenger fields can be generated by yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide some arguments that this scenario can be realized naturally in some dynamical susy - breaking models such as the iss - like model . </S>"
