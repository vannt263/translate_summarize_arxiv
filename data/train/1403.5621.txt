    "since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a weakly interacting bose gas  @xcite , ultracold atomic systems have provided an ideal testing ground for studying the superfluid properties of neutral gases .",
    "especially , ultracold two - component fermi gases have attracted great interest in the expectation that highly controllable systems are provided for simulating strongly correlated electron phenomena , such as high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "a key advantage of the atomic fermi systems is that the inter - component interaction can be widely tuned by the use of the feshbach resonance technique  @xcite .",
    "taking the advantage , the smooth crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid of weakly coupled cooper pairs to the bec of tightly bound molecules has been successfully demonstrated  @xcite . the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite is ubiquitous in various fields of physics such as quark matter  @xcite and neutron stars  @xcite as well as solid - state materials  @xcite .",
    "one of the most characteristic signatures of superfluidity is dissipationless superflow , which can be stable up to a certain critical velocity . in a superfluid atomic gas",
    ", the critical velocity can be directly measured by stirring the gas with a laser beam  @xcite , by applying a sudden displacement of the confinement potential  @xcite or by the use of a moving optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the superflow properties and the critical velocity have been studied with great interest both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite in cold atomic systems . a criterion for the occurrence of dissipationless superflow",
    "was first proposed by landau  @xcite in the context of superfluid @xmath0he . according to the landau criterion",

    "the mechanism of the instability changes from fermionic to bosonic excitations  @xcite .",
    "the predicted pronounced peak of the critical velocity near unitarity has been confirmed experimentally in ultracold superfluid fermi gases with the use of a shallow moving optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the influence of a finite superflow in ultracold atomic gases has been studied also in the presence of deep optical lattices where the tight - binding approximation is valid  @xcite . in the low density limit",
    ", the attractive hubbard model in the presence of superflow exhibits a similar behavior to the homogeneous case  @xcite mentioned above .",
    "away from the low density limit , the ab mode possesses a roton - like dip structure at short wavelength due to density - wave fluctuations .",
    "consequently the short - wavelength collective excitation can occur before the other excitations when the superflow velocity increases .",
    "the instability mechanism of the lattice systems changes depending on the filling , the attraction strength and the geometry of the lattice  @xcite .",
    "it has been also discussed that a charge - density - wave order may appear coexisting with superfluidity due to the softening of the short - wavelength collective excitation . for two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) hypercubic optical lattices , such a  flowing supersolid",
    "\" state is predicted to be unstable because of the negative superfluid stiffness  @xcite . on the other hand , for a fermi superfluid in a moving kagome optical lattice  @xcite ,",
    "the particular geometry of the kagome lattice introduces anisotropy in the hopping amplitude of cooper pairs , leading to a density modulation without breaking the superfluidity .",
    "let us revisit the subject of the flowing homogeneous fermi superfluids in 3d free space . as stated above ,",
    "according to the landau criterion , the superflow is destabilized by bosonic long - wavelength excitations in the strong - coupling bec regime , while fermionic quasiparticle excitations occur in the weak - coupling bcs regime  @xcite .",
    "however the latter does not mean the breakdown of superfluidity since the fermionic excitations can not lower the energy of the system indefinitely due to the pauli exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "in other words , the landau instability due to the fermionic excitations just correspond to the onset for cooper pair breakings .",
    "in fact , it is known that in 3d superconductors , a gapless superconducting state that possesses nonzero order parameter but zero energy gap  @xcite can be allowed to appear in a certain range of supercurrent velocity even after pair breaking starts to occur  @xcite . by analogy with the superconductors ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the possibility of a gapless superfluid state that may exist above the landau critical velocity .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we study the influence of superflow on fermi superfluids at zero temperature ( @xmath5 ) considering the possible flow - induced gapless superfluid states .",
    "first , we calculate the superflow velocity dependence of the superfluid order parameter within the mean - field approximation . in the bcs regime , we find that a gapless superfluid state can survive even after the superflow velocity exceeds the onset for cooper pair breaking as in the case of the 3d superconductors .",
    "the flow - induced gapless superfluid appears in a considerable range of the superflow velocity for the intermediate attractive interaction ( but on the bcs side ) .",
    "however we should note that in a neutral superfluid , the collective ab mode plays a crucial role in the stability of the system in contrast of superconductors , in which the ab mode is pushed up to the plasma frequency due to the long - range coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we analyze the collective excitation spectra by employing the generalized random - phase approximation ( grpa )  @xcite .",
    "the grpa excitation spectrum has a continuum of bogoliubov quasiparticle - pair excitations and the collective ab mode when the superflow is absence  @xcite . in the bcs regime ,",
    "if the superflow velocity exceeds the onset value for the pair breaking , an additional quasiparticle - quasihole continuum and a second collective mode appear .",
    "we find that the excitation energy of the second collective mode can have a nonzero imaginary part even if the superfluid order parameter remains finite .",
    "this excitation leads to an exponential growth of arbitrarily small perturbations in time , called dynamical instability  @xcite . as a result , there remains only a small window of superflow velocity for stable gapless superfluid states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the order parameter that describes cooper pairing with nonzero center - of - mass momentum in order to consider the presence of superflow . within the mean - field approximation , we solve a set of self - consistent equations to determine the region where the gapless superfluid state can appear in the plane of interaction strength and superflow velocity . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , based on the grpa , we discuss the stability of the flow - induced gapless superfluid state and present the stability phase diagram of fermi superfluids in the presence of superflow .",

    "are set to be unity @xmath8 .",

    "<S> we study the collective excitation and stability of superfluid fermi gases flowing with a constant velocity in three - dimensional free space . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate a possible gapless superfluid state induced by the superflow using the mean - field theory and the generalized random - phase approximation ( grpa ) . for weak attractive interactions , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean - field superfluid order parameter can take a nonzero value even after the superflow velocity exceeds the threshold for the onset of bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> since the cooper pairs are only partially broken by the quasiparticle excitations , a gapless superfluid state can be formed over a certain range of superflow velocity above the pair - breaking onset . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the usual quasiparticle - pair continuum and the anderson - bogoliubov collective mode , the grpa excitation spectrum of the gapless superfluid state has a quasiparticle - quasihole continuum and a second collective mode . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the long - wavelength excitations of the second collective mode eventually cause dynamical instability of the system when the superflow velocity increases . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gapless superfluid state still remains stable in a narrow but finite range of superflow velocity .    </S>",
