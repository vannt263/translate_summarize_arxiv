    "one - dimensional driven diffusive systems , unlike their equilibrium counterparts are known to exhibit boundary induced phase transitions @xcite .",
    "such systems have also served the purpose of providing a framework for studying wide class of driven biological phenomenon ranging from transport across biomembranes @xcite , to transport on individual cellular filament @xcite and cytoskeletal filament network @xcite .    filament based intracellular transport involves oppositely directed motors , which use multiple arrays of cytoskeletal filaments , to actively transport cellular cargoes such as mitochondria , endosomes , and pigment granules  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that long - distance cellular cargo transport on microtubule ( mt ) filaments is achieved by sets of oppositely directed motor proteins , e.g ; _ dynein _ and _ kinesin _ , which attach to the cellular cargoes and transport them _ actively _ along these filaments .",
    "the transport itself is determined by different processes at play at the molecular level , e.g ; the motor processivity , directional switching dynamics of the cargo carried by the motors , the underlying filament organization , the ( un)binding characteristics of the motors to the filament and the boundary input(output ) rate of cargoes at filament ends  @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that both long distance regulated transport @xcite and phenomenon of jamming arise out of the collective action of the these motor proteins  @xcite .",
    "one of the approaches to study transport in such systems has been to describe it in terms of coarse - grained driven lattice gas models wherein the mt filament is considered as a 1-d lattice , the interactions between the transported cargoes are included via excluded volume effect and the underlying driven stochastic dynamics due to various processes incorporated in the description  @xcite . some of the previous theoretical attempts have focused on the interplay of stochastic directional switching mechanisms , directional hopping of individual cargoes and the effect of the input and output of the cargoes on the boundaries on a _ single _ filament  @xcite .",
    "however for a variety of biological situations such as axonal transport in neurons , cargo transport takes place on a _",
    "parallel array of mt filaments  @xcite .",
    "for example , _ in vitro _ studies on cultured neurons have revealed that cargo switching between neighbouring filaments occurs in axonal transport of mitochondria on neurons @xcite . on theoretical grounds , it has been argued that even without considering the effects of the boundaries , the interplay of the translation process on filaments and the filament switching processes can manifest in form of a phase transition between a an inhomogeneous _ jammed _ phase of the transported cargoes and a freely flowing phase with homogeneous cargo density in each filament  @xcite . thus studying the role of multiple filaments in determining the transport properties of such systems is of considerable importance .",
    "driven transport on parallel lattices have been studied theoretically in different contexts  @xcite , and the particle switching dynamics between adjacent lanes have also been taken into account explicitly in some cases  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on how the transport along two parallel filaments is affected by the interplay of boundary inflow and outflow of particles at the filament ends and filament switching dynamics of particles . before we proceed describing the mode in detail",
    ", we wish to highlight a few aspects of transport that have been observed in the context of intracellular transport : ( a ) experimental studies , such as the one on endosomal transport on mt reveal that cellular cargoes can switch between neighbouring filaments  @xcite .",
    "( b ) experiments suggest that cellular cargoes traveling in opposite direction on the same mt can also cross each other and continue with their translational motion along the same filament  @xcite .",
    "( c ) cargo transport is also dependent on loading and offloading of cellular cargoes at the filament ends  @xcite .",
    "motivated with these experimental observations , in the model that we study , we focus on the interplay of the boundary driven processes of particle input and output at filament ends with the _ active _ motor driven cargo translocation on the filaments and filament switching processes . accordingly , we will consider two parallel filaments with oppositely directed species of particles which translate on the lattices with a specified hopping rate .",
    "the oppositely directed particles are also allowed to pass through each other with a certain specified rate on the same lattice .",
    "the particles are also allowed to switch between the lattices with certain finite probability _ only _ when oppositely directed species meet each other on the same lattice , so that the switching between the lane is a correlated process  @xcite .",
    "thus implicitly we will consider that individual motors carrying the cargo have a propensity to switch between different filaments when they experience a force , when hindered by an oppositely directed particle moving on the same filament .",
    "this in turn can decrease the binding affinity of the motor to the filament and induce it to switch and bind to the neighbouring filament .",
    "finally we will allow particles to enter and exit the filament ends with prescribed rates .    in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we specify the model , the dynamical rules on the lattice and the corresponding equations of motion for the system . in section  [ sec : mf ] we set up the mean field ( mf ) continuum equations for the system and analyze the boundary conditions at the ends of the lattice . in section  [ sec : phase ] we analyze the different phases possible for the system , obtain the corresponding mf steady states density profiles for the particles and construct the mf phase diagram for the system and compare these results with the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation results . finally in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss these results in context of multi - filament intracellular transport .",
    "we consider two parallel cellular filaments , represented by two finite and parallel one dimensional lattices of length @xmath0 with @xmath1 sites , with lattice spacing @xmath2 .",
    "the cellular cargoes transported along these filaments will be referred to as particles , and will be characterized by two different species .",
    "specifically , along each filament , the transported cargo can either be a @xmath3 particle which moves from left to right on the filament or a @xmath4 particle that moves from right to left . without loss of generality ,",
    "the two filaments are labeled as @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the instantaneous state of the system is described in terms of the occupation numbers , which indicate the spatial localization of the two species of particles on the two parallel filaments .",
    "specifically , @xmath7 corresponds to a occupation number of a particle at site @xmath8 moving to the @xmath9 on filament @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum allowed occupancy at any lattice site is 1 so that each lattice site is occupied either by a @xmath3 particle , @xmath4 particle or is vacant , @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics of this system can be expressed in terms of the movements allowed for the particles .",
    "for the sites in the _ bulk _ , in each individual filament , a @xmath3 particle can hop from site @xmath8 to site @xmath11 with a rate @xmath12 if that site is vacant . similarly a @xmath4 particle can hop from site @xmath8 to site @xmath13 with an identical rate @xmath12 if it is vacant .",
    "if the @xmath8-th site on filament 1 is occupied by a @xmath3 and if the neighboring site to the right , i.e ; site @xmath11 is occupied by an oppositely directed @xmath4 , then two different processes can occur : with rate @xmath14 the two particles can swap their positions , and the @xmath3 particle moves to the site @xmath11 and the oppositely moving @xmath4 particle moves to site @xmath8 ; while with rate @xmath15 the @xmath3 particle can switch the to filament-@xmath6 , at the same corresponding site , identified by its index @xmath8 , if the site is vacant .",
    "similarly , a @xmath4 particle from filament @xmath5 at site @xmath11 can switch to the site of filament @xmath6 with the same site index @xmath11 with a rate @xmath16 if that site on the other filament is vacant .",
    "identical processes that we have described for filament @xmath5 also happens for filament @xmath6 .",
    "the rates of filament switching processes from filament @xmath6 to filament @xmath5 for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles are @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles , respectively .",
    "particle switching between the two filaments can be understood as arising from the stronger loading force experienced by the motor proteins which carry the cargo when they push against an oppositely directed cargo .",
    "this leads to an increase in the rate of motor detachment ( along with the cargo ) from the filament and offers the possibility of a subsequent reattachment of the molecular motor to the neighbouring site on the other filament  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the regime where the filaments are _ weakly _ coupled , we probe the regime where the filament switching processes compete with loading and offloading processes at filament boundaries .",
    "we systematically implement it by choosing the filament switching rates at individual lattice site such that they scale inversely with system size so that we have , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    although the bulk processes are analogous to those introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which focused on the collective behavior of cargoes moving along filaments with a _ closed _ ring morphology and with overall particle number conservation , we will concentrate on the behavior of such particles for open filaments . in this configuration the overall particle number is not conserved , and the motion on incoming and outgoing particles at the filament ends must be accounted for .",
    "for the _ boundary sites _ at the filament ends , a @xmath3 particle can enter the left end of the filament ( with site label @xmath23 ) of filament @xmath5 with a rate @xmath24 if it is vacant , and it can leave from the right end of the filament ( with site label @xmath25 ) of filament @xmath5 with a rate @xmath26 . similarly",
    "a @xmath4 particle can enter the right end of the filament @xmath5 with a rate @xmath27 if it is vacant and it can leave from the left end of the filament with a rate @xmath28 .",
    "similar processes also occur in filament @xmath6 with the corresponding rates being @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "all the the dynamic processes that characterize the model are schematically depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "the time evolution for the average occupation number for the two oppositely directed species along each individual filament can be expressed in terms of gain and loss terms arising from translation and filament switching processes . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , these terms involve the averages of the local occupation numbers for the particles at each site as well as various combination of averages of two - point correlators of site occupation numbers , which account for the role of particle correlations in the particle collective dynamics .",
    "we set @xmath33 and choose @xmath34 , which correspond to a symmetric scenario where the propensity to switch filaments is the same for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 species and it is symmetric about filament @xmath5 and filament @xmath6 . the mean field ( mf ) evolution equations are obtained factorizing the two point correlators of the occupation numbers .",
    "the continuum mf evolution equations are derived by rescaling the total length @xmath0 to @xmath5 and letting @xmath35 so that @xmath36  @xcite .    correspondingly , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are then the average densities as a function of the relative position in the filament , @xmath41 .",

    "one can rewrite them in terms of the fluxes of the total number of particles and its difference introducing @xmath49 since in the bulk the total current for the combined system comprising of the two filaments is isolated , @xmath50 and @xmath51 have to be spatially constant .",

    "appendix b also describes the different sets of density profiles that can be obtained from the previous set of equations .",
    "we have found that there are 16 different branch solutions corresponding to the decoupled differential equation .",
    "the choice of a particular boundary condition corresponding to a particular phase , restricts the possible choices to 8 .",
    "finally as discussed in appendix b , physical considerations such as bounds on the physical value of density selects an unique solution to these differential equations for each set of prescribed boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , the continuous mf equations determine the density profiles of the particles in the two filaments , once the boundary conditions are prescribed .",
    "although eqs.([eq : decup+1]- [ eq : decup-2 ] ) for the different species densities decouple in the bulk , they are coupled through the boundary condition of eqs.([eq : cur5]- [ eq : cur3 ] ) . in the next subsection",
    "we discuss the set of boundary conditions satisfied by these differential equation corresponding to a particular phase .",
    "the allowed phases that characterize the state of transport on the two filaments is controlled by the particle input and output at the boundaries .",
    "the steady state density profiles are determined by first order differential equations .",
    "this is due to the fact that the diffusive contribution is of higher order in the lattice spacing , @xmath46 , and their contribution drops in the continuum limit , @xmath67 . as a result ,",
    "the system can not fulfill , generically , the input and output boundary conditions and boundary layers are expected  @xcite .",
    "one then must determine which of the fluxes at the filaments ends determine the bulk density profiles and under which conditions coexistence between density phases can develop along the filaments .",
    "for the system composed of two filaments , we have 8 different particle entrance or exit rates at the boundaries , that we express as @xmath68,@xmath69 .",
    "however there are only 4 boundary conditions to be specified for the complete solution of the steady state differential equations . in order to figure out the possible physically relevant boundary conditions , it is useful to build upon the boundary conditions that are satisfied by a closely related 1-d lattice gas model  @xcite , which has the similar translocation dynamics along the filament as our model , but which does not allow for inter - filament exchange processes .",
    "in fact the model discussed in ref .  @xcite is exactly the same as ours for the particular case of @xmath70 , which corresponds to a situation where the inter - filament switching dynamics of the particles is turned off .",
    "since for our case , the filaments are weakly coupled thus it is expected that the boundary conditions satisfied for our two - filament system are the various possible combination of the boundary conditions that are satisfied for individual lattice for the case studied in ref .",
    "however we would like to stress that although the boundary conditions are obtained as simple combination of boundary conditions of the individual lattices , the resultant density and current profile obtained by spatially integrating the steady state differential equation would be qualitatively different due to the lattice switching term in the bulk .",
    "we enumerate the possible combination of the boundary conditions and the resultant phases for each of those particular combinations .    _ filament @xmath5 in @xmath71 phase and filament @xmath6 in @xmath71 phase _ ( @xmath72 )",

    ", we will assume that the @xmath3 current in left boundary of filament @xmath5 equals the @xmath3 current in right boundary of the same filament , @xmath89 .",

    "analogously , we equate the currents at the left and the right boundary in filament @xmath6 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because tracks are weakly coupled , as has been checked with mc simulation .",
    "this fact allows us to obtain an expression for the boundary densities in this phase .",
    "explicitly , from eq.([eq : cond52 ] ) and eq.([eq : cond72 ] ) , the boundary densities for both the lanes read , @xmath93 these coupled algebraic equations for each filament track can be numerically solved to get the corresponding boundary densities from which the density profiles can be numerically derived .    _ filament @xmath5 in @xmath82 phase and filament @xmath6 in @xmath71 phase : _ ( @xmath94 ) : when for filament @xmath5 , the bulk current of @xmath3 matches with the input current of @xmath3 at the left boundary and input current of @xmath4 matches with the bulk current of @xmath4 at the right boundary and the bulk current of @xmath3 matches the output current of @xmath3 at the right boundary and the input current of @xmath4 matches with the bulk current of @xmath4 at the right boundary in filament @xmath6 , the resultant phase for the system corresponds to @xmath82 phase in filament @xmath5 and @xmath71 phase in filament @xmath6",
    ".    in this case we again assume the continuity of the fluxes separately for the two particle types along filament 1 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "accordingly , the equations for the boundary densities are similar in form to those expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asld - ldcon2 ] ) and the boundary densities for filament @xmath5 can be obtained numerically as discussed earlier . for filament @xmath6 ,",
    "the densities are determined by eq.([eq : ld2den- ] ) .",
    "due to the symmetry in the swapping rates between the two filament , a second phase with analogous structure is feasible , where filament @xmath5 in @xmath71 phase and filament @xmath6 in @xmath82 .",
    "there is still a further symmetry associated with the hl phase in any of the two filaments , i.e ; if the current of @xmath4 and @xmath3 at the left boundary matches with the currents in the bulk , the structure of the boundary conditions remains unaltered .",
    "in order to illustrate this , consider hl phase in a particular filament , then the corresponding densities are determined by eq.([eq : ld2den- ] ) and the boundary condition at @xmath97 is satisfied , so that @xmath3 is in high density phase and @xmath4 is in low density phase .",
    "but analogously we could have a situation where the boundary condition at @xmath98 is satisfied with @xmath3 particles in low density phase and @xmath4 in high density phase .",
    "this situation would correspond to a different overall phase , but structure and the form of boundary density would be the same as eq  .([eq : ld2den- ] ) with the only difference that the indexes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the expression for the boundary density in eq  .([eq : ld2den- ] ) is interchanged .",
    "thus this structure of boundary conditions would correspond to 4 distinct phases .",
    "since the boundary fluxes control the particle fluxes in the bulk , once we have determined the expression for the densities at the filament boundaries in terms of the input and output rates at the filament boundaries , the mf density and current profiles in the bulk can be determined from eq.([eq : decup+1]-[eq : decup-2 ] ) . however , unlike the case of model in ref.@xcite where the steady state density profiles and the corresponding phases in the bulk are solely determined by the boundary fluxes , the density profiles and phases now emerge from the interplay of the boundary processes and particle filament switching .",
    "this distinctly alters the nature of the density profiles and the topology of the phase diagram for the system under study .",
    "specifically , a first major consequence of particle exchange between filaments is that the density and current profiles in the bulk are no longer spatially homogeneous .",
    "in fact for certain range of input and output particle rates , the competition between the bulk and the boundary processes can result in density shocks along the filaments which are localized in the bulk .",
    "moreover , particle change between filaments also allows for _ phase coexistence _ in the bulk apart from the _ pure _ phases which satisfies only one set of boundary conditions .",
    "this feature of phase coexistence occurs only because the current profiles in the bulk for a set of boundary conditions are not homogeneous so that different mf solutions for the current , intersect each other at specific spatial location in the bulk of the system .",
    "the phase coexistence in the bulk happens when the currents of the different mf solutions arising out of different boundary conditions match at a point in the bulk of the two - filament system . in that case",
    "part of the system obeys one set of the boundary conditions while the other half obeys another set of boundary condition and these set of solutions are joined by the condition of continuity of current at a particular location in the bulk of the lattice . in general",
    "the system selects the set of mf steady state solution for which the corresponding current is minimum .",
    "this holds true as long as the mf current profiles do not attain the maximal current value in the bulk . in this paper",
    "we have restricted our analysis to the region of parameter space of entry and exit rates of particles for which the condition for maximal current is not reached .    as a result of these new features ,",
    "the topology of the resulting phase diagram changes qualitatively with respect to the collective behavior in the absence of inter - filament particle exchange . in the following subsection",
    "we first describe the procedure to find the mf density and current profiles and determine the resultant phase .",
    "subsequently we discuss the topology of the resultant phase diagram for this system and obtain the equations for the phase boundaries .      in order to find the mf density and current profiles using eq.([eq : decup+1]-[eq : decup-2 ] ) , we have to first determine the three independent conserved currents in the system e.g ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath99 .",
    "subsequently , we have to provide the appropriate values of the densities at the boundaries to completely specify the solutions for the individual species .    _",
    "@xmath100 phase _ : here , first we determine the values of the boundary densities at the right end of both filaments , e.g ; @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 using eq.([eq : hd1den+ ] ) . thus @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 can be determined at the right boundary .",
    "the entire density profile can now be found out by evolving the mf solution from the left end of both filaments using eq.([eq : decup+1]-[eq : decup-2 ] ) . in fig.2",
    ", we show the comparison of the mf profile with the mc simulations for this phase .",
    "it illustrates that both the density and the current profiles in the two filaments are not spatially homogeneous in contrast to similar phases in ref .",
    "a similar procedure can be used to find out the profiles for the corresponding @xmath101 phase .    _",

    "pure _ phase , the effect of filament switching of particles manifests as enriching the phase behaviour for the system which allows for phase coexistence and presence of shocks in the two filaments .    as illustrated in these two examples ,",
    "generically we find that two pure phases are always connected by a phase region where the system exhibits phase coexistence and bulk localized shocks .",
    "to summarize , we have studied a multi - filament driven system with oppositely directed species of particles when the filaments are weakly coupled .",
    "particle filament switching processes constitute correlated events because particles can only swap filaments , with a prescribed finite probability , when oppositely directed particles meet on the same filament .",
    "this aspect of filament switching mimics cellular cargo switching between neighbouring filaments during intracellular transport .",
    "we find that the interplay of the entry and exit processes of particles at the filament boundaries has a profound impact in the collective organization of the two species of displacing particles , leading to a variety of new scenarios .",
    "specifically , we have identified the development of phase coexistence on the filaments , inhomogeneous density profiles , density shocks localized in the bulk and bidirectional current flows in the system .",
    "we have developed a mean field theory ( mf ) to characterize these phenomena , and have shown that the steady state density and current profiles of particles and the phase diagram obtained using a mf formulation match reasonably well with the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation results .",
    "while in this paper we have focused on the implications that weak coupling between filaments would have on transport when there are particle input and output in both filaments , it would be interesting to explore the regime of strong filament coupling , where we expect a weaker spatial inhomogeneity in the particle density profiles .",
    "further , for many biological situations such as transport in axons , it is _ a priori _ not clear whether boundary loading and off - loading of cellular cargo happens for all the parallel filaments or for specific filaments .",
    "in such situation one needs to determine the steady state distribution of cargoes and the resultant phases when one of the filament has much higher particle entry rates than the other .    as an extreme case ,",
    "we have considered a situation where one filament has closed boundaries .",
    "starting from a random distribution of particles in both filaments , we have observed the development of phase segregation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles in the closed filament .",
    "this phenomenon happens only due to the correlated lane switching process .",
    "the resulting phase segregated state in the blocked filament does not have any flux . following the time evolution of such",
    "a system shows that starting from a random configuration , all the vacancies are expelled and eventually the filament stops exchanging particles with the other filament as the blocked filament attains a jammed configuration , with the @xmath3 particles piling up from the left end of the filament while the @xmath4 particles pile up on the right end .",
    "understanding the transition of this phase segregated jammed steady state to the steady states discussed in this paper as one slowly increases particle input and output for the filament which is initially closed at the boundaries , remains as an interesting open challenge .",
    "for determining the steady state density and current profiles on filaments , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have been performed to simulate the various processes described in section  [ sec : model ] . for a mc move",
    ", a filament is chosen at random and then a site in that particular filament is chosen at random with equal probability . if a particle ( @xmath209 ) or ( @xmath189 ) is present then a move is made for the various dynamic processes ( e.g ; translation or lane switching ) , proportional to the respective rates .",
    "we begin the simulation run starting from a random initial distribution of particles in the two filaments and let the system evolve and reach steady state .",
    "after the system has attained steady state , averaging is done over occupation number and current in the lattice .",
    "typically we wait for initial transient of @xmath210 swaps , where @xmath211 is rate of the slowest process among all the different dynamic processes occurring in the lattices .",
    "we have further checked that the system indeed reaches its steady state by comparing the final density and current profiles at the end of the transient .",
    "we then collect the data for occupation number and current with a period @xmath212 and average them over @xmath213 time swaps .    in order to determine the phase boundaries by mc simulations , we use the fact that all phase transitions between pure phases are mediated by phase coexistence regions with shocks in the density profile .",
    "the phase boundaries can be determined numerically by tracking when the location of shock reaches the filament boundary . however , due to the finite size effects of the system , the shock has a certain finite width .",
    "we determine the shock width and track the position of the midpoint of the shock to identify the phase boundaries numerically and decide when they have reached a filament end .",
    "we have used system size of @xmath214 for determining the location of phase boundaries . for a fixed @xmath215",
    "we have varied @xmath216 in steps of @xmath217 and this sets the accuracy of the phase boundaries obtained numerically .",
    "to choose a proper branch uniquely from the potential eight solutions that can be derived from the mean field solutions for a particular variable we have to look carefully at the density profiles of various species in a particular phase .",

    "<S> we study a two filament driven lattice gas model with oppositely directed species of particles moving on two parallel filaments with filament switching processes and particle inflow and outflow at filament ends . </S>",
    "<S> the filament switching process is _ correlated _ such that particles switch filaments with finite probability only when oppositely directed particles meet on the same filament . </S>",
    "<S> this model mimics some of the coarse grained features observed in context of microtubule ( mt ) based intracellular transport , wherein cellular cargo loaded and off - loaded at filament ends are transported on multiple parallel microtubule ( mt ) filaments and can switch between the parallel microtubule filaments . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a regime where the filaments are weakly coupled , such that filament switching rates scale inversely as the length of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the interplay ( off)loading processes at the boundaries and the filament switching process leads to some distinctive features of the system . </S>",
    "<S> these features includes occurrence of variety of phases in the system with inhomogeneous density profiles including localized density shocks , density difference across the filaments and bidirectional current flows in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the system by developing a mean field ( mf ) theory and comparing the results obtained from the mf theory with the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the dynamics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the steady state density and current profiles of particles and the phase diagram obtained within the mf picture matches quite well with mc simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> these findings maybe useful for studying multi - filament intracellular transport . </S>"
