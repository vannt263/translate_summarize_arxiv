    "recently , new data on the analysis of @xmath1 decays were published by two collaborations : kek - e246 @xcite and istra @xcite , in addition to the presentation given by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "so , at present we have got quite precise measurements of characteristics in the @xmath2 decays , that needs a theoretical interpretation in the framework of standard model ( sm ) as well as beyond it .",
    "such the study is of interest because of the experimental search for effects , which can point to the contributions with the violation of combined cp - parity in the kaon decays , for example , the transverse t - odd polarization of lepton in @xmath3 modes @xcite , that can essentially enrich the information on the cp - breaking dynamics in addition to the program with the b - mesons @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of decay is parameterized in terms of scalar , vector and tensor form factors , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in the following general form @xcite : @xmath7 = { g_{\\rm f } v_{su}}\\ ,   \\bigg[- l_\\mu \\big(f_+ p^\\mu + f_- q^\\mu\\big ) + 2 m_k l_s f_s + { \\rm i}\\,\\frac{f_t}{m_k}\\ , l_{\\mu\\nu } p^\\mu q^\\nu \\bigg ] , \\label{me}\\ ] ] where the lepton currents are given by the expressions @xmath8 so that chiral spinors are @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the fermi constant , @xmath11 is the mass of kaon .",
    "the four - momenta are defined as @xmath12 while @xmath13 is the matrix element of cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa matrix for the mixing of weak charged quark - currents .",
    "we define the generators @xmath14 by the commutator @xmath15.\\ ] ] the dependence of form factors on @xmath16 is usually expressed in terms of linear slopes normalized to get the dimensionless quantities @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pion mass .",
    "the combination of form factors @xmath19 is introduced , so that the experimental data are given in terms of the following set @xcite : @xmath20 the data of @xcite on @xmath21 can be averaged , so that with the statistical errors we get @xmath22 while the systematic uncertainties are given in the original papers .",
    "the values in ( [ l+ ] ) and ( [ l0 ] ) result in the ratio @xmath23 the given parameter @xmath24 is in a good agreement with the pdg values for both the electron and muon modes @xcite , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 above are within the limits of 1.5@xmath14-deviations from the pdg averages .",
    "the preliminary analysis by ktev @xcite gives @xmath27 which is close to the estimate in ( [ l+ ] ) .    in the framework of sm",
    "we get the form factors @xmath28 while @xmath29 therefore , the study of scalar and tensor form factors is a good test for the search of ` new ' physics beyond the sm .    supposing ( [ v ] ) , we derive @xmath30 implying that the form factor @xmath31 determines the matrix element of scalar quark - current .",
    "the contraction of vector lepton - current @xmath32 induces the scalar term in the matrix element .",
    "so , the electron mode is more sensitive to the extraction of scalar form factor , since the sm background contribution is suppressed by the lepton mass , @xmath33 at present , the measurements of @xmath4 and @xmath6 result in values slightly deviating from zero , that is consistent with the expectations of sm .",
    "so , in the electron mode @xcite @xmath34 where we have taken into account the redefinition of sign in comparison with the appropriate formula in @xcite as accepted in this paper in ( [ me ] ) , while the combined analysis of muon and electron modes in @xcite results in the similar values @xmath35 the collaboration ktev presented the following constraints in the electron mode : @xmath36 in the present paper we study nonzero contribution of leptoquark interactions to the tensor form factor , which correlates with the scalar one due to the fierz transformation . in section 2 the effective lagrangians with the virtual leptoquarks are described as concerns for the decays of @xmath37 , and the requared matrix elements of quark currents are presented .",
    "general expressions for the hadronic matrix elements with the tensor structure are derived in section 3 , where we develop the model based on the dominance of vector and scalar mesons and adjust it in the description of @xmath38 form factors . in the framework of potential approach",
    "the preferable region of model parameter is limited in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the constraints on the masses of scalar leptoquark and their couplings to the fermions are obtained in section 4 .",
