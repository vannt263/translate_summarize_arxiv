    "the addition of oppositely charged polyions to a suspension of charged colloidal particles gives rise to an intriguing and partially unexpected phenomenology @xcite , resulting in the formation of aggregates which play an important role in a wide range of implications @xcite , from membrane biophysics and soft matter physics @xcite to biotechnological processes , such as therapeutic delivery systems @xcite .",
    "these aggregates are governed by a delicate balance between attractive and repulsive interactions resulting in the appearance of an equilibrium ( or a kinetically arrested ) cluster phase , where single particles , stuck together by an electrostatic  glue  acting between oppositely charge domains , form reversible , relatively large , complexes . in this system , the short - range attraction contribution is promoted by the addition of  adsorbing  polyions which form a two - dimensional strongly correlated , short - range ordered , structure on the surface of the oppositely charged particle , contrarily to what happens for  non - adsorbing  polymers , where the attraction contribution is produced by the unbalanced osmotic pressure in the depletion regime .",
    "in fact , correlated adsorption of polyion chains on the surface of oppositely charged particles induces two different phenomena :  charge inversion@xcite and  reentrant condensation@xcite .",
    "the first one occurs when a colloidal particle binds several oppositely charged multi - valent ions ( polyions ) , so that its effective charge inverts its sign . the second effect , concomitant to the charge inversion , consists in the formation of particle aggregates whose average size increases on increasing the polyion concentration , until it reaches a maximum ( at the point of charge inversion ) , decreasing afterwards to the initial value .",
    "this phenomenology has been investigated in a variety of different colloidal systems both for particles bearing a negative charge ( such as dotap liposomes ) in the presence of anionic polyions @xcite and for positively charged particles ( such as hybrid niosomes ) in the presence of cationic polyions@xcite .    )",

    "<S> polymer chains adsorbed onto oppositely charged spherical colloidal particles can significantly modify the particle - particle interactions . for sufficient amounts of added polymers , the original electrostatic repulsion can even turn into an effective attraction and relatively large kinetically stable aggregates can form . the attractive interaction contribution between two oppositely particles arises from the _ correlated _ adsorption of polyions at the oppositely charged particle surfaces , resulting in a non - homogeneous surface charge distribution . here , we investigate the aggregation kinetics of polyion - induced colloidal complexes through monte carlo simulation , in which the effect of charge anisotropy is taken into account by a dlvo - like intra - particle potential , as recentely proposed by velegol and thwar [ _ d . </S>",

    "<S> the results reveal that in the presence of a charge heterogeneity the aggregation process slows down due to the progressive increase of the potential barrier height upon clustering . within this framework </S>",
