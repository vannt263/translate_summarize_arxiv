    "polygonal quantum rings are nanoscale structures with diameters from tens to hundreds of nanometers and lateral thickness down to few nanometers @xcite . such structures may be achieved due to the possibility of combining two or more different materials into one vertical structure , i.e. , core - shell nanowires .",
    "they contain a core , itself a quantum wire , which is covered by one or more layers of different materials .",
    "due to the variety of controllable physical properties core - shell nanowires have recently turned out to be suitable building blocks of many quantum nanodevices such as solar cells @xcite , nanoantennas @xcite , field - effect transitions @xcite , lasers @xcite , including plasmon lasers @xcite , light - emitting diodes @xcite , thz radiation sources @xcite and detectors @xcite .",
    "one of the physical properties which may be modeled during the growth process is band alignment .",
    "core - shell nanowires are built of at least two different materials , each one having its own energy structure , which changes considerably in the presence of strain @xcite . in most cases",
    "core and shell materials have different lattice constants , and thus the combined system differs substantially from the bulk of each component , or from single material nanowires , and depends on the geometrical details .",
    "this provides a possibility to control band alignment through the core and shell thicknesses @xcite and thus to achieve systems in which conduction electrons may be found only in the shell area @xcite .",
    "the present art of manufacturing allows for etching the core part such that the remaining shell forms a nanotube of finite thickness @xcite .",
    "if such nanowires are sufficiently short , i.e. , of height much smaller that the radius , then they may be considered as quantum rings , as long as only the lowest wave - function mode in the growth direction is relevant .",
    "physical properties of polygonal quantum rings differ considerably from their circular counterparts .",
    "electrons are always equally distributed along the whole circumference of homogeneous circular structures , while in the case of polygonal systems the localization pattern is much more complicated .",
    "as in the case of bent quantum wires @xcite , in the corners of polygonal rings effective quantum wells are formed , with energy levels determined by the size and shape of the area between internal and external polygon boundaries .",
    "this results in localization of low energy electrons in the vicinity of corners , whereas carriers associated with higher energy levels are purely or partly localized in side areas @xcite . in the absence of external fields the ground state of circular rings is twofold ( spin ) degenerate while all exited states are fourfold ( spin and orbital momentum ) degenerate . in the case of polygonal rings",
    "the ground state is also twofold degenerate , but higher levels are either two- or fourfold degenerate and the degeneracy pattern is determined by the number of corners @xcite .",
    "depending on the ring shape , corner - localized states may be separated from side - localized ones by an energy gap @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how the spectral properties of the single electron states confined in triangular quantum rings depend on the geometric aspect ratio , i.e. , the ratio between the lateral thickness and the side length , or , equivalently , the radius of a circle encompassing the ring .",
    "we show how corner localization maxima merge with increasing side thickness and define conditions under which low energy electrons are expelled from side areas .",
    "the ground state energy and splittings between consecutive levels depend on the ring s shape .",
    "the energy gap separating corner- from side - localized states may reach high values for thin triangular samples and may be tuned within a wide energy range . as a result",

    "the energy degeneracy depends only on the ring symmetry and the fourfold degenerate levels may be split into pairs of spin degenerate eigenvalues if the symmetry is broken by , e.g. , different side thicknesses .",
    "the spin degeneracy is lifted when the sample is immersed in external magnetic field .",
    "the splittings between consecutive levels strongly depend on aspect ratio . if the external radius is assumed to be constant then , the separations between the ground state and all other states associated with corner - localized probability distributions increases with side thicknesses . the main energy gap which separates corner- from side - localized states decreases with the side thickness until the lowest energy gap , occurring for the aspect ratio of about @xmath38 ,",
    "is reached and then the gap increases slightly again .",
    "contrary to other polygonal rings , in the case of triangular samples this gap is always considerably larger than the energy splittings in the corner state domain .",
    "the position of the ground state , followed by the excited levels , is shifted to lower energies with increasing side thickness .",
    "electron localization is also very sensitive to the sample shape .",
    "low - energy electrons confined in thin rings occupy only very small corner areas , with increasing side thickness the corresponding localization peaks penetrate into side areas and overlap .",
    "the probability distributions associated with energy levels above the main gap change in the opposite way , i.e. , wide peaks spread along side areas become sharper with increasing aspect ratio and for sufficiently thick rings are accompanied by lower maxima formed around corner areas .",
    "the energy levels and corresponding wave functions govern absorption spectrum of the systems .",
    "the positions of absorption peaks are determined by energy splittings between pairs of particular levels , while their amplitudes depend on dipole moments and thus on wave functions . as a result",
    "the energy of absorbed electromagnetic field depends on sample shape .",
    "since the corner- and side - localized states are always separated by a considerable energy gap , excitations of an electron from the ground state to other corner - localized states and side - localized states occurs in the presence of photons associated with wavelengths belonging to different electromagnetic domains .",
    "thus , by selecting the appropriate ring thickness and shape , one can engineer the absorption in the thz and in the infrared domain .     for simplicity of description and discussion",
    "we keep the external radius constant and change only the side thickness .",
    "the way how the energy levels change does not depend on the ring diameter but only on the aspect ratio between the side thickness and the external radius .",
    "nonetheless energy levels of nanoscale systems do depend on sample sizes , and thus the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energies ] calculated for different external radii would look the same , but the axes would be scaled differently .     throughout this work",
    "the electron - electron coulomb interaction was neglected . strictly speaking the results presented correspond to transitions of a single electron in the triangular ring .",
    "as long as the coulomb interaction is small , possibly due to a large dielectric constant of the material , its main effect is a renormalization of the energy spectrum .",
    "however , because of the small energy dispersion of the corner states , non - trivial coulomb effects could be expected .",
    "this work was mainly supported by the research fund of the university of iceland .",
    "additional funding from the nordic network nanocontrol , project no . : p-13053 , and cost action mp1204 tera - mir radiation : materials , generation , detection and applications is acknowledged .",

    "<S> the energy levels strongly depend on the aspect ratio of the triangle sides , i.e. , thickness / length ratio , in such a way that the energy differences are not monotonous functions of this ratio . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the energy gap between the group of states localized in corners and the states localized on the sides strongly decreases with increasing the side thickness , and then slightly increases for thicker samples . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing the thickness the low - energy shell remains distinct but the spatial distribution of these states spreads . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the energy levels and localization leads to a thickness dependent absorption spectrum where one transition may be tuned in the thz domain and a second transition can be tuned from thz to the infrared range of electromagnetic spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we show how these features may be further controlled with an external magnetic field . in this work </S>",
