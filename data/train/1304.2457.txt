    "given the considerable development in automated sky survey programs , the detection rate of supernovae ( sne ) has increased enormously ( ( * ? ? ? * lennarz et al . 2012 ) ) in the last few years . in a volumetric study",
    "it was found that more than 50% of all sne are hydrogen rich ( type ii ) , of which about 70% show prolonged plateau ( iip ) in their light curves ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* li et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "type ii sne show diversities in their light curves and spectra .",
    "indeed there are distinct classes @xmath0 normal and subluminous events - which show different properties , along with several peculiar events like sn 1987a , which resulted from explosion of a blue supergiant star . following the discovery of sn 2008 in ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* gandhi et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "the nearby event sn 2012a also showed similar behaviour , and is the prime target of our study .",
    "sn 2012a was discovered on 7.39ut , january , 2012 in the nearby ( @xmath1 9 mpc ) galaxy ngc 3239 at an unfiltered magnitude of 14.6 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* moore et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "it was classified as a type iip event , with a spectrum similar to that of sn 2004et at about 14d post explosion , confirming its identity as a young type iip ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stanishev and pursimo 2012 ; roy and chakraborti 2012 ) ) .",
    "the ground based optical photometric observations were carried out at the 104-cm sampurnanand telescope ( st ) using johnson @xmath2 and cousins @xmath3 filters , and also from the 130-cm devasthal fast optical telescope ( dfot ) using @xmath4 filters .",

    "a closer view of the transient location obtained from a pre - sn dss image is presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sn2012a_close ] . several star - forming knots , cataloged in the 2mass survey and marked around the sn position , are prime sources of contamination of sn flux . in order to calculate the correct sn flux , a ` template - subtraction technique '",
    "is required , but due to absence of pre - sn @xmath5 images of this field , in the present work the instrumental magnitudes of the sn are derived by the profile ( psf ) fitting method .",
    "sdss magnitudes of the nearest star forming knot have been used for a rough estimation of background flux .",
    "therefore the measurements are expected to represent closely the true sn magnitude when it is bright , i.e. , in the early plateau phase , while in later epochs the background flux is substantial , and hence the estimated parameters will be marginally affected .",
    "the long - slit low - resolution spectroscopy in the optical range ( @xmath6 ) was performed at eight epochs during 14d and 134d : three epochs from the 2-m iucaa girawali observatory ( igo ) , one epoch from the 3.5-m astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) telescope and at five epochs from 2-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) .",
    "we also report on the high resolution spectroscopy from 3.5-m arc at the early plateau phase of the transient .",

    "* leonard et al ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "the continuum dominated early spectra ( 14d,19d and 20d ) demonstrate the high photospheric temperature during the initial epochs .",

    "h@xmath7 profiles , representing the velocity of the outer ejecta ,",
    "show a clear bimodal distribution : low luminosity events asymptotically attain a lower velocity than normal events , though they are much more systematic than normal type iip .",
    "sn 2012a is located near the lower edge of the velocity distribution of normal events .",
    "photospheric velocity measured from the scii 5527 line is almost similar in both cases , and sn 2012a preserves the characteristic features of normal type iip sne .",
    "galactic reddening along the line of sight , e(@xmath8 ) = 0.32@xmath90.0005 mag ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* schlegel et al . 1998 ) ) and the mean distance of the host is 8.6@xmath90.5 mpc . in our analysis of the high - resolution 3.5 m arc spectra , no sign of naid at host galaxy velocity is found , although there is weak caii h and k absorption .",
    "the upper limit on the column density ratio of naid / caii at the host galaxy velocity is very low ( naid / caii @xmath10 0.04 ) , indicating very little dust grain depletion of ca .",
    "therefore we presume that extinction is mainly dominated by the milky - way .    from the estimated mid - plateau absolute v - band magnitude ( @xmath1115.1 mag ) , photospheric velocity ( @xmath12 kms@xmath13 ) and plateau duration ( @xmath14110 days ) , the basic parameters of the progenitors have been calculated using the prescriptions of ( * ? ? ?",

    "this is certainly a crude estimation and more detailed modelling is essential ."
