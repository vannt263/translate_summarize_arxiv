    "the possible existence of the pentaquark is one of the most exiting questions in current particle phenomenology . so far",
    ", more than ten experiments have found evidence for the existence of a pentaquark state @xcite .",
    "however , an almost equal number of experiments do not see any signal at the mass of the pentaquark @xcite .",
    "the experiments who reported positive results work in a medium energy range and have limited statistics .",
    "no pentaquark was seen in high energy experiments , however , the production mechanism is unclear and it is very difficult give an estimate for the production rate .",
    "higher statistics experiments will be needed to clarify the existence of this new hadronic state .",
    "a review on the present experimental status can e.g. be found in @xcite .",
    "these investigations have triggered an intense theoretical activity and for an overview on the theoretical status we refer to reader to @xcite .",
    "one of the most puzzling characteristics of the pentaquark is its extremely small width ( much ) below 10 mev which poses a serious challenge to all theoretical models .",
    "indeed , in the conventional uncorrelated quark model the expected width is of the order of several hundred mev , since the strong decay @xmath2 is okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) super - allowed .",
    "many explanations for this narrow width have been advanced @xcite . a suggestive way to explain",
    "the small width is by the assumption of diquark clustering @xcite .",
    "the formation of diquarks presents an important concept and has direct phenomenological impact @xcite .    in this work",
    "we calculate the pentaquark decay width within the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "the basis of the sum rules was laid in @xcite and their extension to baryons was developed in @xcite .",
    "the assumptions of the model are incorporated by an appropriate current .",
    "the sum rules are directly based on qcd and keep the analytic dependence on the input parameters .",
    "several sum rule calculations have been performed for the mass of the pentaquark containing a strange @xcite or charm @xcite quark .",
    "these calculations are based on two - point functions with different interpolating currents .",
    "surprisingly , all these determinations give similar masses with reasonable values .",
    "a common problem of all determinations is the large continuum contribution which has its origin in the high dimension of the interpolating currents and results in a large dependence on the continuum threshold .",
    "another problem is the irregular behavior of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , which is dominated by higher dimension operators and not by the perturbative term as it should be .    here",
    "we present for the first time a sum rule determination for decay width based on a three - point function for the decay @xmath3 . in this way we can extract the coupling @xmath4 which is directly related to the pentaquark width . to describe the pentaquark we use the diquark - diquark - antiquark model with one scalar and one pseudoscalar diquark in a relative s - wave .",
    "in @xcite it has been argued that such a small decay width can only be explained if the pentaquark is a genuine 5-quark state , i.e. , it contains no color singlet meson - baryon contributions and thus color exchange is necessary for the decay .",
    "they start from simple observations concerning symmetries of the quark currents and the properties of the basic decay diagram as shown in fig .",
    "the analysis presented both in @xcite and in @xcite is only qualitative and arrives at the conclusion that , for a particular choice of the pentaquark current and assuming that it is a genuine 5-quark state , the decay width is given by @xmath5 . in this expression @xmath6",
    "appears due to a hard gluon exchange and is therefore small .",
    "the narrowness of the pentaquark width can then be attributed to chiral symmetry breaking and the non - trivial color structure of the pentaquark which requires the exchange of , at least , one gluon . in this work",
    "we will also test quantitatively the hypothesis put forward in @xcite to see whether this mechanism is sufficient to explain the small width .",
    "the effect of chiral symmetry breaking for two chirally different diquarks in a relative s - wave was estimated in @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that chiral breaking alone is not sufficient to explain a very small pentaquark width and our investigation will support this finding .",
    "whereas the qcd sum rule determinations for the mass of the pentaquark are based on two - point functions @xcite , an investigation of the decay width requires a three - point function which we define as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the interpolating fields associated with neutron , kaon and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we now consider the expression ( [ correl ] ) in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom and write the phenomenological side of the sum rule .",
    "though in @xcite it has been argued that a scalar - pseudoscalar diquark model is more likely related to a negative parity pentaquark , in this work we make no assumption about the parity of the @xmath11 and investigate the consequences for both cases . treating the kaon as a pseudoscalar particle ,",
    "the interaction between the three hadrons is described by the following lagrangian density : @xmath12 writing the correlation function ( [ correl ] ) in momentum space and inserting complete sets of hadronic states we obtain @xmath13 with @xmath14 where the spinors are normalized according to @xmath15 using the simple feynman rules derived from ( [ lag ] ) we can rewrite @xmath16 as @xmath17 the coupling constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be determined from the qcd sum rules of the corresponding two - point functions .",
    "@xmath20 is related to the kaon decay constant through @xmath21 combining the expressions above we arrive at @xmath22 where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to a negative ( positive ) parity pentaquark . finally ,",
    "writing all the dirac structures explicitly , the phenomenological correlator is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 we shall work with the @xmath25 structure because , as it was shown in @xcite , this structure gives results which are less sensitive to the coupling scheme on the phenomenological side , i.e. , to the choice of a pseudoscalar or pseudovector coupling between the kaon and the baryons .",
    "the continuum part contains the contributions of all possible excited states .",
    "they require a special treatment and we will discuss these terms separately after presenting the theoretical contributions .",
    "we now come back to ( [ correl ] ) and write the interpolating fields in terms of quark degrees of freedom as @xmath26 [ \\bar{d}_b(0)c\\bar{u}^{t}_a(0)]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the current of the pentaquark incorporates the assumption of a diquark - diquark - antiquark system with a scalar and pseudoscalar diquark . inserting these currents into ( [ correl ] ) , the resulting expression can be written in the following form : @xmath27k(y)\\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath28 in order to proceed with the evaluation of the correlator ( [ correl ] ) at the quark level , we need the quark propagator in the presence of quark and gluon condensates . keeping track of the terms linear in the quark mass and taking into account quark and gluon condensates , we have s_ab(x)&= & t[q_a(x)_b(0)]=i_ab2 ^2x^4-m_q_ab4 ^ 2x^2-i32 ^ 2x^2t^a_ab g^a _",

    "( [ n1 ] ) and these into ( [ gamma1 ] ) , we arrive at a complicated function which is given schematically by the sum of the diagrams of fig .",
    "2 . for any given dirac structure",
    "this function can be written in a factorized form : @xmath29 after fourier transformation , this leads to a similar separation in momentum space .",
    "the diagrams of fig .",
    "2 can then be expressed in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "let us consider the phenomenological side ( [ vfen3 ] ) and , following @xcite , rewrite it generically as a double dispersion relation : @xmath32 the double discontinuity can be written as the sum : @xmath33 where the continuum thresholds are defined as @xmath34 the terms proportional to @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent pole - continuum transitions where the pentaquark ( in the ground state or in an excited state ) decays into one ground state nucleon and one exited kaon or vice versa . inserting ( [ discont_ioffe ] ) into ( [ double_ioffe ] )",
    "we can write @xmath37 where @xmath38 comes from the first term in ( [ discont_ioffe ] ) and stands for the pole - pole part . the coefficient @xmath39 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ vfen3 ] ) and we get @xmath40 the continuum - continuum term @xmath41 can be obtained as usual , with the assumption of quark - hadron duality , from the double dispersion integral ( [ double_ioffe ] ) using the theoretical expressions @xmath42 .",
    "we can also write a double dispersion integral for @xmath43 and , because of duality , @xmath41 may be transferred to the theoretical side .",
    "this only changes the integration limits , so that the final theoretical side or right - hand side of the sum rule reads : @xmath44 the pole - continuum transition terms are contained in @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "they can be explicitly written as @xmath47 in a usual three - point sum rule the quark lines in fig . 1",
    "connect all three particles , thus forming a triangle graph .",
    "after a double borel transformation the continuum parts are exponentially suppressed compared to the pole contribution .",
    "one can then safely make the assumption of quark - hadron duality and parametrise the continuum by the double discontinuity of the theoretical part .",
    "however , as was first noticed in @xcite , diagrams where only two particles are connected contain a contribution in the pole - continuum transitions which is not exponentially suppressed compared to the pole contribution , even after double borel transform .",
    "therefore these contributions can be as large as the pole part and must be explicitly included in the sum rules .",
    "since there is no theoretical tool to calculate the unknown functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 explicitly , one has to employ a parametrisation for these terms .",
    "we will use two different parametrisations : one with a continuous function for the @xmath11 and one where the pole term is singled out .",
    "the difference between the two parametrisations should give an indication about the systematic error .",
    "in the analysis it will turn out that the pole - continuum terms are indeed of the same order as the pole contribution and should not be neglected .",
    "* parametrisation a : *    we shall assume that the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the following form : @xmath50 with continuous functions @xmath51 , starting from @xmath52 .",
    "the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 describe the excitation spectra of the kaon and the nucleon , respectively . from experimental data",
    "we know that the nucleon has a very well established first excitation , the roper resonance ( @xmath55 mev ) , which is relatively far from the ground state .",
    "this suggests that the nucleon pole - continuum transitions will be saturated by the nucleon - roper transitions . in order to simplify the calculations",
    ", we shall take advantage of this fact and use @xmath56 . in the case of the kaon ,",
    "surprisingly , no pseudoscalar higher excitation has been observed so far .",
    "since the kaon excitations seem not to prefer any particular mass , we can not use the simplification applied above to the nucleon and therefore no assumption will be made on @xmath53 .",
    "after borel transform , the pole - continuum term contains one unknown constant factor which can be determined from the sum rules .",
    "* parametrisation b : *    in order to investigate the role played by the @xmath11 continuum , we shall now explicitly force the phenomenological side to contain only the pole part of the @xmath11 , both in the pole - pole term and in the pole - continuum terms . this can formally be done by choosing @xmath57 .",
    "the functions then read : @xmath58 in this case we have the @xmath11 in the ground state and leave an open nucleon spectrum . again , in the final expressions this gives an additional constant which can be calculated .",
    "the sum rule may be written inserting ( [ gamma1 ] ) into ( [ correl ] ) and identifying it with ( [ vfen3 ] ) . as can be seen explicitly in ( [ estrut ] ) , each side of this identity contains a sum of different dirac structures .",
    "the sum rule implies that the coefficients of each dirac structure are equal both in the phenomenological side and in the theoretical side and therefore a sum rule is actually a set of equations . in principle",
    "we could work with any of the dirac structures .",
    "as mentioned above , we shall work with the @xmath25 structure .    in order to suppress the condensates of higher dimension and at the same time reduce the influence of higher resonances we may perform on both sides of the sum rule a standard borel",
    "transform @xcite : ( m^2 ) _ n , q^2 ( q^2)^n+1 ( - ) ^n ( q^2 ) , [ borel ] ( @xmath59 ) with the squared borel mass scale @xmath60 kept fixed in the limit .",
    "the above formulas are quite general . in order to proceed with the numerical analysis we have to decide how many borel transforms we shall perform . in the case of the two - point function",
    "there is only one four momentum and thus only a single borel transform is possible . in the case of the three - point function",
    "considered here , there are two independent momenta and we may perform either a single or a double borel transform .",
    "if we were interested in computing the vertex form factor we would necessarily need to know the momentum dependence of the vertex function and this would imply making a borel transform in two momentum variables ( for example in @xmath61 and in @xmath62 ) , leaving the other momentum ( @xmath63 ) free .",
    "since here we are mostly interested in the coupling constant we have more options which , in principle , should lead to the same result .",
    "we shall follow the procedure adopted in the past in similar situations .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we first consider the choice : @xmath64 and perform a single borel transform : @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in this case",
    "we take @xmath67 and single out the @xmath68-terms . we may call this scheme the  kaon - pole-method .",
    "the second choice is : @xmath69 here we perform two borel transforms : @xmath65 and @xmath66 and also @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we have also considered the choice @xmath72 , performing one single borel transform ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this procedure was first advanced in @xcite , used later sometimes and has the advantage of simplifying the calculations .",
    "however , in the present calculation we were not able to find a stable sum rule .",
    "moreover the equal momenta choice is less justified than the others , because when we set two momenta squared equal , this bears some connection with the masses or virtualities of the particles in the vertex . from this point of view",
    ", setting @xmath73 is quite reasonable , since the masses of the on - shell @xmath11 and nucleon are not so different . on the other hand ,",
    "the kaon mass squared is much smaller ( and might even be set to zero ) than @xmath74 and thus @xmath75 should not be close to it .",
    "therefore in what follows the equal momenta choice will not be further considered .    in both cases considered above",
    ", there is no need of making extrapolations in order to obtain the coupling . introducing the notation @xmath76 and using ( i ) and ( ii ) we obtain the following sum rules :    * method i : kaon - pole *    @xmath77    and for the pole - continuum part we obtain @xmath78 in both parametrisations the term @xmath45 is exponentially suppressed and , as discussed in @xcite , has been neglected .",
    "@xmath79 is an unknown constant and can be determined from the sum rules .    * method ii : double borel *    @xmath80    and @xmath81 also in this case @xmath45 is exponentially suppressed .",
    "in this section we determine the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "it is directly related to the experimentally measured @xmath11 decay width through @xmath82 \\sqrt{\\lambda(m_{\\theta}^2,m_{n}^2,m_k^2)}\\,,\\ ] ] where the upper ( lower ) sign is for positive ( negative ) parity and @xmath83 the hadronic masses are @xmath84 mev , @xmath85 mev , @xmath86 mev and @xmath87 mev .",
    "a decay width of @xmath88 mev then corresponds to the following coupling constants : @xmath89 for each of the sum rules above ( eqs .",
    "( [ soma1 ] ) and ( [ soma2 ] ) ) we can take the derivative with respect to @xmath90 and in this way obtain a second sum rule . in each case",
    "we have thus a system of two equations and two unknowns ( @xmath91 and @xmath79 ) which can then be easily solved .",
    "the results will depend on the numerical choices for all input parameters , including the strange quark mass , the condensates , the hadron masses and the choices of the continuum thresholds for the nucleon , @xmath92 , and for the kaon , @xmath93 .    in the numerical analysis of the sum rules we use the following values for the condensates",
    ": @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the gluon condensate has a large error of about a factor 2 , but its influence on the analysis is relatively small .",
    "the couplings constants @xmath99 and @xmath100 are taken from the corresponding two - point functions : @xmath101 the coupling @xmath102 is obtained from ( [ decaek ] ) with @xmath103 mev , @xmath104 mev and @xmath105 mev : @xmath106      as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the generic decay diagram in terms of quarks has two  petals  , one associated with the kaon and the other with the nucleon . in fig . 2 this picture",
    "is completed with the inclusion of all the relevant condensates . among these ope diagrams",
    "there are two distinct subsets . in the first ( from 2a to 2 g )",
    "there is no gluon line connecting the petals and therefore no color exchange . a diagram of this type we call color - disconnected . in the second subset of diagrams ( 2h , 2i and 2j ) we have color exchange .",
    "if there is no color exchange , the final state containing two color singlets was already present in the initial state , before the decay , as noticed in @xcite . in this case",
    "the pentaquark had a component similar to a @xmath107 molecule . in the second case",
    "the pentaquark was a genuine 5-quark state with a non - trivial color structure .",
    "we may call this type of diagram a color - connected ( cc ) one . in our analysis",
    "we write sum rules for both cases : all diagrams and only color connected .",
    "the former case is standard in qcdsr calculations and therefore we shall omit details and present only the results .",
    "the latter case implies that the pentaquark is a genuine 5-quark state and the evaluation of @xmath1 will thus be based only on the cc diagrams . in this way we can test whether the assumption of the pentaquark being a genuine 5-quark state is sufficient to explain such a small decay width .      in order to proceed with the numerical analysis",
    "we must choose a sum rule window for the borel parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 . to ensure the convergence of the ope we use values above 1 gev .",
    "the upper limit is given by the condition that the continuum contribution should not be much larger than 50% .",
    "thus we use a range of @xmath110 . since the strange mass is small , the dominating diagram is fig .",
    "2b of dimension three with one quark condensate .",
    "we have found out that the contribution from the pole - continuum part is of a similar size as the pole part . for lower values of @xmath108 around 1 gev@xmath111 , the pole contribution dominates , however , for larger values of @xmath112 the importance of the pole - continuum contribution grows and eventually becomes larger than the pole part .",
    "this is an additional reason to restrict the analysis to small values for the borel parameters .",
    "we have evaluated the sum rules for the coupling constant computed with all diagrams of fig . 2 and",
    "we have found that they are very stable . in order to avoid repetition",
    "we do not show the corresponding curves of @xmath4 as afunction of the borel mass squared @xmath112 .",
    "we give only the values of the coupling extracted at @xmath113 gev@xmath111 and @xmath114 gev@xmath111 in table i. in what follows we shall present our results for the coupling constant @xmath4 obtained with the color connected diagrams only . in fig .",
    "3 we show the coupling , given by the solution of the sum rule i a ( [ soma1 ] ) , as a function of the borel mass squared @xmath112 .",
    "different lines show different values of the continuum threshold @xmath115 .",
    "as it can be seen , @xmath4 is remarkably stable with respect to variations both in @xmath112 and in @xmath115 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the coupling obtained with the sum rule ii a ( [ soma2 ] ) .",
    "we find again fairly stable results which are very weakly dependent on the continuum threshold .",
    "comparing the results obtained with i a and ii a , we see that they are consistent with each other within the errors inherent to the method of qcd sum rules . in fig .",
    "5 we show the results of the sum rule i b. in fig . 6 we present the result of the sum rule ii b. the meaning of the different lines is the same as in the previous figures .",
    "the results are similar to the cases before .    in table",
    "[ table1 ] we present a summary of our results for @xmath4 giving emphasis to the difference between the results obtained with all diagrams and with only the color - connected ones . for the continuum thresholds",
    "we have employed @xmath116 gev .",
    ".[table1 ] @xmath1 for various cases [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for our final value of @xmath1 we take an average of the sum rules ia - iib .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the influence of the continuum threshold is relatively small , especially when compared to the corresponding two - point functions .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the continuum thresholds , in the coupling constants @xmath117 and in the quark condensate we we get an uncertainty of about 50% .",
    "our final result then reads : @xmath118 including all diagrams , the prediction for @xmath119 is then 13 mev ( 652 mev ) for a positive ( negative ) parity pentaquark . in the cc case",
    "we get a width of 0.75 mev ( 37 mev ) for a positive ( negative ) parity pentaquark .",
    "one should keep in mind that higher dimensional condensates and higher order perturbative corrections could increase this prediction for the width .",
    "the parity of the pentaquark has not been experimentally determined .",
    "the measured value of the width is around 5 - 10 mev both in the kn channel ( considered here ) and in the kp channel .",
    "we see that it is difficult to obtain the measured decay width for a negative parity pentaquark .",
    "we have presented a qcd sum rule study of the decay of the @xmath120 pentaquark using a diquark - diquark - antiquark scheme with one scalar and one pseudoscalar diquark . based on an evaluation of the relevant three - point function ,",
    "we have computed the coupling constant @xmath1 . in the operator product expansion",
    "we have included all diagrams up to dimension 5 . in this particular type of sum rule",
    "a complication arises from the pole - continuum transitions which are not exponentially suppressed after borel transformation and must be explicitly included .",
    "the analysis was made for two different pole - continuum parametrisations and in two different evaluation schemes .",
    "the results are consistent with each other . in addition",
    ", we have tested the ideas presented in @xcite by including only diagrams with color exchange .",
    "our final results are given in eq .",
    "( [ gfinal ] ) .",
    "we find that for a positive parity pentaquark a width much smaller than 10 mev would indicate a pentaquark which contains no color - singlet meson - baryon contribution .",
    "for a negative parity pentaquark , even under the assumption that it is a genuine 5-quark state , we can not explain the observed narrow width of the @xmath11 . in @xcite",
    "the pentaquark was investigated in a nonrelativistic quark model for a diquark - diquark - antiquark configuration with two scalar diquarks in a relative p - wave .",
    "it was found that a narrow width is difficult to achieve , unless the pentaquark has an uncommon spatial structure .",
    "it seems that from the theory side a very small pentaquark width is not impossible , but that the pentaquark has indeed to be in a special configuration to explain the observed decay width .",
