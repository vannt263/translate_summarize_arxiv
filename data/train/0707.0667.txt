    ", we have that @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the wave function in momentum space @xmath17 is the fourier transform of @xmath14 . the sharp inequality @xcite @xmath18 places a nontrivial lower bound on the sum of the uncertainties in position and momentum",
    ", so it provides a quantitative formulation of the position - momentum uncertainty principle . using the variational inequality that relates information entropy and standard deviation for an arbitrary @xmath0-dimensional random variable @xcite , @xmath19 the entropic uncertainty relation ( [ bbm ] ) leads to the well - known heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath20 which proves the former to be stronger than the latter .    for many important quantum systems , such as @xmath0-dimensional harmonic oscillator and hydrogen atom , the calculation of position and momentum information entropies involves the evaluation of integrals of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes a polynomial sequence ( @xmath23 ) orthogonal on @xmath24 \\subseteq \\mathbb{r}$ ] with respect to the weight function @xmath25 . during the last decade",
    "there has been an intense activity in the study of these integrals , motivated not only by their relevance to quantum physics but also by their close relationship to other interesting mathematical objects , such as the @xmath26-norms or the logarithmic potentials of the polynomials @xmath27 . a survey on the state - of - the - art in this field up to year 2001",

    "are thus given by @xmath40    the integrals @xmath41 are especially relevant in the case when @xmath2 is a non - negative integer or half - integer number , due to the relationship between the corresponding gegenbauer polynomials and ( hyper)spherical harmonics .",
    "as a consequence , these integrals appear in the calculation of the angular component of information entropies in both position and momentum space for any @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath42 ) quantum - mechanical system with a central potential , such as the isotropic harmonic oscillator or the hydrogen atom ( radially symmetric coulomb potential ) @xcite .",
    "they also control the radial component of the information entropy in momentum space for the @xmath0-dimensional hydrogen atom @xcite .    instead of using the standard definition of gegenbauer polynomials , it is often more convenient to work with the polynomials @xmath43 which are orthonormal on @xmath37 $ ] with respect to the probability density @xmath44 the corresponding entropies , @xmath45 ^ 2 \\log \\ , [ \\widehat{c}_n^{(\\lambda)}(x)]^2 \\ , \\widehat{w}_{\\lambda}(x ) \\ , \\rmd x \\;,\\ ] ] are related to @xmath41 by the formula @xmath46 which readily follows from the previous definitions by taking into account the orthogonality relation ( [ gegengauer ] ) .",

    "finally , in section [ section5 ] some concluding remarks are given and several open problems are pointed out .",

    "<S> the position and momentum information entropies of @xmath0-dimensional quantum systems with central potentials , such as the isotropic harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom , depend on the entropies of the ( hyper)spherical harmonics . in turn , these entropies are expressed in terms of the entropies of the gegenbauer ( ultraspherical ) polynomials @xmath1 , the parameter @xmath2 being either an integer or a half - integer number . up to now , however , the exact analytical expression of the entropy of gegenbauer polynomials of arbitrary degree @xmath3 has only been obtained for the particular values of the parameter @xmath4 . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a novel approach to the evaluation of the information entropy of gegenbauer polynomials , which makes use of trigonometric representations for these polynomials and complex integration techniques . using this method </S>",
