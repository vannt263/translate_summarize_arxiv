    "the collective behavior of nuclei with a triaxial shape has attracted much attention over the years . unfortunately , conclusive experimental signatures for such a shape have proven difficult to establish .",
    "nevertheless , pairs of nearly degenerate @xmath2 bands of the same parity seen in nuclei with mass a @xmath3 100  @xcite and a @xmath3 130  @xcite have been interpreted as chiral partner bands , where breaking of the chiral symmetry is only possible for a triaxial nuclear shape .",
    "also , rotational sequences measured in a @xmath3 160  175 nuclei   have been associated with the triaxial shapes predicted by theory for this mass region . very recently , it has been proposed that the very high spin rotational bands discovered beyond band termination in @xmath4er are also associated with the rotation of triaxial shapes  @xcite .",
    "the strongest experimental evidence for rotation of a triaxial nucleus available thus far has been found in a number of lu isotopes , where bands with characteristic properties have been associated with the wobbling mode  . in triaxial nuclei , where different moments of inertia are associated with the three principal axes , rotation about the three axes is quantum mechanically possible .",
    "although rotation about the axis with the largest moment of inertia is favored , the contributions from rotations about the other two axes can force the rotation angular momentum vector ( r ) off the principal axis to create a precession or wobbling mode of which the classical analog is the rotation of an asymmetric top . as a result",
    ", a triaxialy deformed nucleus will exhibit a family of rotational bands ( with identical moments of inertia ) based on the same configuration , but with different wobbling phonon number ( @xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "because the observed sequences also have relatively large deformation , they are often referred to as triaxial strongly deformed ( tsd ) bands .    until very recently , the fact that wobbling had only been observed in the lu isotopes , and not in any of the neighboring tm , ta and hf nuclei of the region , remained somewhat of a puzzle .",
    "tsd bands have been reported in many of these isotopes  , but none of them was found to exhibit deexcitation properties characteristic of wobbling . in particular ,",
    "the interband transitions that provide a clear signature for wobbling in the lu isotopes are absent .",
    "a possible resolution of the issue has recently been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , following new experimental data on the @xmath1tm nucleus . in this work ,",
    "two strongly interacting tsd bands were identified .",
    "these sequences were found to be linked by several interband transitions . however , these connecting @xmath6 rays do not exhibit properties similar to the ones characteristic of wobbling .",
    "rather , they are akin to what would be expected for collective structures associated with particle - hole ( ph ) excitations in a tsd well . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this interpretation was backed by calculations carried out within the framework of the tilted - axis cranking model .",
    "these calculations not only reproduced the experimental observables for @xmath1tm , but also provided a plausible explanation for the presence of wobbling bands in the @xmath7lu isotopes and their absence in the @xmath8tm , @xmath9hf and @xmath10ta neighbors . indeed , the possibility to identify wobbling bands experimentally is restricted by the competition of these collective excitations with the ph excitations .",
    "only if the excitation energy above the yrast line of the ph configurations is higher than the corresponding energy of the wobbling bands will the latter be fed appreciably in fusion - evaporation reactions .",
    "this appears to be the case only in @xmath7lu , where the fermi surface lies on the i@xmath11 orbital and there is a wide gap in the proton level density .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is two - fold . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interpretation of the two @xmath1tm sequences as tsd bands rested solely on indirect experimental indications ( such as the magnitude and evolution with frequency of the moments of inertia ) and on the agreement with the calculations . here ,",
    "direct experimental evidence that the two bands are associated with a larger deformation than the yrast sequence is provided through the measurement of transition quadrupole moments .",
    "furthermore , this work provides an additional test of the calculations through a comparison of the calculated and measured moments .",
    "the experiment was performed at the argonne tandem linac accelerator system ( atlas ) .",
    "a beam of 165 @xmath12 @xmath13cl was used to bombard a `` thick '' target , which consisted of a 0.813 mg/@xmath14 thick @xmath15te layer ( isotopic enrichment @xmath16 @xmath17 ) evaporated on a 15 mg/@xmath14 thick au foil backed by a 15 mg/@xmath14 layer of pb .",
    "the states of interest in @xmath1tm were fed in the @xmath18 reaction and their mean lifetimes were measured with the doppler shift attenuation method ( dsam ) .",
    "the thickness of the au backing was chosen such that the evaporation residues came to a full stop within this au layer , while the projectiles came to rest in the additional pb foil .    in the six - day run , over 1.5 @xmath19",
    "10@xmath20 coincidence events with fold @xmath16 3 ( @xmath21 , with at least three prompt coincident @xmath6 rays ) were collected by the gammasphere detector array  @xcite .",
    "since the dsam technique involves the detection of @xmath6 rays during the slowing down process in the thick target , the relation between the average energy shifts and detector angles needs to be determined . for this purpose ,",
    "the raw data was sorted into several blue  @xcite database files . unlike traditional data - storage techniques for high - fold @xmath6-ray coincidence events , such as the radware software package  @xcite , the blue database stores the data in its original fold without unfolding .",
    "thus , each blue file corresponds to the ensemble of all coincidence events of a given fold , and each element in the event remains encoded not only with the @xmath6-ray energy and time information , but also with the auxiliary information , @xmath22 , the detector identification .",
    "the specific data structure of blue is such that producing background - subtracted spectra at a given detector angle under specific coincidence requirements can be achieved efficiently with the method described in ref .",
    "the present work focuses on four rotational bands delineated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and shown in fig .  [ fig:163tm_level_scheme_prc ] .",
    "hence , the nomenclature proposed in that paper has been adopted here , @xmath21 , the two bands associated with the @xmath237/2^{-}$ ] configuration of normal deformation are designated as band 1 ( @xmath24  @xmath25 sequence ) and 2 ( @xmath26  @xmath27 cascade ) , while the proposed triaxial bands are labeled as tsd1 ( @xmath26  @xmath28 sequence ) and tsd2 ( @xmath29  @xmath30 cascade ) , respectively . from a first inspection of the coincidence data",
    ", it was established that the transitions with energy @xmath31 @xmath32 600 @xmath33 in bands 1 and 2 did not exhibit any measurable shift or broadening as a function of the detector angle . in other words , these deexcitations must have occurred after the recoiling nuclei have come to rest in the au layer of the target .",
    "these `` stopped '' transitions could thus be used as a starting point to obtain coincidence spectra for each band at ten detector angles , from which energy shifts would be determined .",
    "the use of `` stopped '' transitions alone proved to be insufficient .",
    "hence , angle - dependent gates had to be placed on band members in an iterative procedure starting with the lowest @xmath6 ray exhibiting a shift and moving up in the band one transition at each step .",
    "this procedure could be applied not only to bands 1 and 2 , but also the tsd1 and tsd2 sequences since the latter deexcite into bands 1 and 2 . in the process of selecting appropriate gating conditions ,",
    "special care was taken to avoid numerous contaminant lines from either other @xmath1tm band structures or other reaction products , as well as some in - band doublet @xmath6 rays such as the 680-@xmath33 line in tsd1 , for example , which corresponds both to the @xmath34@xmath35@xmath28 transition and to the @xmath36@xmath35@xmath37 transition in the decay sequence toward bands 1 and 2  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the analysis of band tsd2 proved to be particularly challenging as it is the one most affected by the closeness in energy of many in - band transitions with either those in band 2 or other contaminant peaks . proceeding in this careful manner ,",
    "an optimized spectrum was obtained at each detector angle by summing up all clean double - gated coincidence spectra with the appropriate gating conditions .",
    "representative spectra resulting from this analysis are presented in fig .",

    "the positions of unshifted and shifted @xmath6 rays are marked by energy values and arrows , respectively .",
    "note that transitions from band 2 appear in the band 1 spectra ( marked with @xmath39 symbols ) due to the fact that intense connecting transitions occur between the two bands , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite.[fig : dsamspectra ] ]    the fractions of full doppler shift @xmath40 and the associated errors were subsequently extracted for transitions in the four @xmath1tm bands of interest through linear fits of the shifts measured at 10 angles with the expression @xmath41  @xcite . here",
    ", for every transition @xmath42 is the nominal @xmath6-ray energy , @xmath43 is the measured energy at the angle @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the initial recoil velocity of the @xmath1tm residues formed in the center of the @xmath15te target layer .",

    "a number of assumptions were made in order to compute the average recoil velocity at which the decay from a particular state occurs .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) all levels in a given band have the same transition quadrupole moment @xmath0 ; ( 2 ) the sidefeeding into each level in a band is modeled as a single cascade with a common , constant quadrupole moment @xmath48 , and characterized by the same dynamic moment of inertia @xmath49 as the main band into which they feed ; the number of transitions in each sidefeeding band is proportional to the number of transitions in the main band above the state of interest ; ( 3 ) the sidefeeding intensities are determined directly from the measured @xmath6-ray intensities within the bands ; and ( 4 ) a one - step delay at the top of all feeder bands was parameterized by a single lifetime @xmath50 .",

    "the initial positions and velocity vectors for each of 10,000 starting ions were calculated in a monte carlo fashion which included the broadening of the recoil cone due to the evaporation of neutrons from the @xmath53tm compound nucleus .",
    "the production cross section was assumed to be constant over the range of energies due to the beam slowing down in the target .",
    "this resulted in an even distribution for the starting positions of the @xmath1tm ions throughout the target thickness .",
    "the initial @xmath1tm ion positions in the target , ion energies , and recoil direction were supplied as input to the srim 2003 code , which then transported each ion through the target and the backing .",
    "the detailed recoil history for each ion was written out to a computer file which listed the energy , direction , and position at which each collision of the recoiling @xmath1tm ions with the target and backing atoms occurred .",
    "the lifetime code then read in this file and tracked each ion history in one femto - second ( 1 @xmath54 ) time steps from initial formation until the ion came to rest .",
    "in order to compute the doppler shifted energies of each @xmath6 ray emitted by the recoiling @xmath1tm ions in a monte - carlo fashion , feeder bands into each state in the main band were randomly populated according to the measured intensity distribution .",
    "the subsequent decay profile through the feeder and main band was tracked in 1 @xmath54 steps , with the decay probability given by the radioactive decay law using the @xmath50 parameter and lifetimes generated from each @xmath48 , @xmath0 parameter set .",
    "the velocity vector of the @xmath6 emitting ion was recorded at the time of decay of each state of interest .",
    "the calculated average fraction of the full doppler shift was generated by accumulating a large number of histories . in the present analysis ,",
    "each of the 10,000 ion histories was used 10 times , resulting in better than @xmath55 statistical uncertainty in the calculated @xmath40 values .",
    "a @xmath56 minimization using the fit parameters @xmath0 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 was performed to the measured @xmath40 values for the four bands .",

    "@xcite , the large @xmath138 gap makes it unlikely that the @xmath1tm tsd bands involve a three - quasiparticle structure with a proton coupled to a neutron particle - hole excitation . the possibility that these bands correspond to configurations with the odd proton occupying the @xmath1431/2^{-}$ ] level ( labeled as @xmath101 in fig .",
