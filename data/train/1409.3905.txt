    "this problem of estimating the hafnian seems to be harder to attack than the corresponding problem for the permanent since many algorithms known for permanent approximation break down when extended to hafnians .",
    "in particular , the lsw rescaling algorithm @xcite transforms the adjacency matrix of a graph to an almost doubly stochastic one . yet , a nontrivial lower estimate of the hafnian of a doubly stochastic matrix is impossible ; see @xcite .",
    "also , in contrast with the computation of the permanent , @xcite points out that the proof of convergence of the mcmc algorithm breaks down for the approximate computation of the hafnian ( unless the minimal degree is at least @xmath7 , see @xcite ) .",

    "our goal in this paper is to analyze the performance of the barvinok estimator for the hafnian . as in @xcite , establishing the concentration of a random determinant hinges on bounding the singular values of the gaussian matrix @xmath11 .",
