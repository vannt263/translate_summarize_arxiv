    "one of the basic tasks of modern high energy physics is the study of the fundamental theory of strong interaction ( quantum chromodynamics , qcd ) in new , unexplored extreme regimes of super - high densities and temperatures through the investigation of the properties of hot and dense multi - parton and multi - hadron systems produced in high - energy nuclear collisions  @xcite . indeed , qcd is not just a quantum field theory with an extremely rich dynamical content ( such as asymptotic freedom , chiral symmetry , non - trivial vacuum topology , strong cp violation problem , colour superconductivity ) , but perhaps the only sector of the standard model , where the basic features ( as phase diagram , phase transitions , thermalisation of fundamental fields ) may be the subject to scrutiny in the laboratory .",
    "the experimental and phenomenological study of multi - particle production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is expected to provide valuable information on the dynamical behaviour of qcd matter in the form of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , as predicted by lattice calculations .",
    "experimental data , obtained from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at maximum beam energy in the center of mass system of colliding ions @xmath0 gev per nucleon pair , supports the picture of formation of a strongly interacting hot qcd matter ( `` quark - gluon fluid '' ) in the most central au+au ( and likely cu+cu ) collisions  @xcite .",
    "this appears as significant modification of properties of multi - particle production in heavy ion collisions as compared with the corresponding proton - proton ( or peripheral heavy ion ) interactions . in particular , one of the important perturbative ( `` hard '' ) probes of qgp is the medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , so called `` jet quenching ''  @xcite , which is predicted to be very different in cold nuclear matter and in qgp , and leads to a number of phenomena which are already seen in the rhic data on the qualitative level , such as suppression of high-@xmath1 hadron production , modification of azimuthal back - to - back correlations , azimuthal anisotropy of hadron spectra at high p@xmath2 , etc .",
    "a number of approaches to the description of multiple scattering of hard partons in the dense qcd - matter have been developed  @xcite taking into account the interference pattern for the emission of gluons with a finite formation time ( qcd analog of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect in qed  @xcite ) besides the radiative loss ( which is supposed to be dominant mechanism of medium - induced partonic energy loss ) , collisional loss due to elastic scatterings were also quantified in different theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one of the most spectacular features of low transverse momentum ( `` soft '' ) hadroproduction at rhic are strong collective flow effects : the radial flow ( ordering of the mean transverse momentum of hadron species with corresponding mass ) and the elliptic flow ( mass - ordered azimuthal anisotropy of particle yields with respect to the reaction plane in non - central collisions ) .",
    "the development of such a strong flow is well described by the hydrodynamic models and requires short time scale and large pressure gradients , attributed to strongly interacting systems  @xcite .",
    "the heavy ion collision energy in large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will be a factor of @xmath3 larger then that in rhic , thereby allows one to probe new frontiers of super - high temperature and ( almost ) net - baryon free qcd  @xcite",
    ". the emphasis of the lhc heavy ion data analysis ( at @xmath4 tev per nucleon pair for lead beams ) will be on the perturbative , or hard probes of the qgp ( quarkonia , jets , photons , high - p@xmath2 hadrons ) as well as on the global event properties , or soft probes ( collective radial and elliptic flow effects , hadron multiplicity , transverse energy densities and femtoscopic momentum correlations ) .",
    "it is expected that at lhc energies the role of hard and semi - hard particle production will be significant even for the bulk properties of created matter .",
    "ongoing and future experimental studies of relativistic heavy ion collisions in a wide range of beam energies require the development of new monte - carlo ( mc ) event generators and improvement of existing ones . especially for experiments which will be conducted at lhc , due to very high parton and hadron multiplicities",
    ", one needs fast ( but realistic ) mc tools for heavy ion event simulation  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of mc technique for the simulation of high - multiplicity hadroproduction is that it allows a visual comparison of theory and data , including if necessary the detailed detector acceptances , responses and resolutions .",
    "a realistic mc event generator should include a maximum possible number of observable physical effects which are important to determine the event topology : from the bulk properties of soft hadroproduction ( domain of low transverse momenta @xmath5gev@xmath6 ) such as collective flows , to hard multi - parton production in hot and dense qcd - matter , which reveals itself in the spectra of high-@xmath1 particles and hadronic jets .    in most of the available mc heavy ion event generators ,",
    "the simultaneous treatment of jet quenching and collective flow effects is absent .",
    "for example , the popular mc model hijing  @xcite includes jet production and jet quenching , but it does not include flow effects .",
    "the partonic energy loss mc models pyquen@xcite , jewel  @xcite , q - pythia  @xcite , yajem  @xcite and martini  @xcite combine a perturbative final state parton shower with qcd - medium effects and simulate the jet quenching in various approaches , but without considering the soft component of final hadronic state .",
    "the event generators fritiof  @xcite and luciae  @xcite include jet production ( without jet quenching ) , while some collective nuclear effects ( such as string interactions and hadron rescatterings ) are taken into account in luciae .",
    "another mc model therminator  @xcite includes detailed statistical description of `` thermal '' soft particle production and can reproduce the main bulk features of hadron spectra at rhic ( in particular , describe simultaneously the momentum - space measurements and the freeze - out coordinate - space data ) , but it does not consider hard parton production processes .",
    "there is a number of microscopic transport hadron models ( urqmd  @xcite , qgsm  @xcite , ampt  @xcite , etc . ) , which attempt to analyze the soft particle production in a wide energy range , however they also do not include in - medium production of high-@xmath1 multi - parton states .",
    "another heavy ion event generator , zpc  @xcite , has been created to simulate parton cascade evolution in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . from a physical point of view",
    ", such an approach seems reasonable for very high beam energies ( rhic , lhc ) .",
    "however the full treatment of parton cascades may require significant amount of cpu run time ( especially for lhc ) .",
    "hydjet++ event generator  @xcite includes detailed treatment of soft hadroproduction as well as hard multi - parton production , and takes into account medium - induced parton rescattering and energy loss .",
    "the heavy ion event in hydjet++ is the superposition of two independent components : the soft , hydro - type state and the hard state resulting from multi - parton fragmentation .",
    "note that a conceptually similar approximation has been developed in  @xcite .",
    "hydjet++ model is the development and continuation of hydjet event generator  @xcite , and it contains the important additional features for the soft component : resonance decays and more detailed treatment of thermal and chemical freeze - out hypersurfaces  @xcite . the main program hydjet++ is written in the object - oriented c++ language under the root environment  @xcite .",
    "the hard part of hydjet++ is identical to the hard part of fortran - written hydjet and it is included in the generator structure as a separate directory.when the generation of soft and hard components in each event at given impact parameter @xmath7 is completed , the event record ( information about coordinates and momenta of primordial particles , decay products of unstable particles and stable particles ) is formed as the junction of these two independent event outputs .    the details on physics model and simulation procedure of hydjet++ can be found in the corresponding manual  @xcite .",
    "the main features of hydjet++ model are listed only very briefly below .",
    "the model for the hard multi - parton part of hydjet++ event is the same as that for hydjet event generator , and it based on pyquen partonic energy loss model  @xcite .",
    "the approach to the description of multiple scattering of hard partons in the dense qcd - matter ( such as quark - gluon plasma ) is based on the accumulative energy loss via the gluon radiation being associated with each parton scattering in the expanding quark - gluon fluid and includes the interference effect ( for the emission of gluons with a finite formation time ) using the modified radiation spectrum @xmath8 as a function of decreasing temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the model takes into account radiative and collisional energy loss of hard partons in longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid , as well as realistic nuclear geometry .",
    "the fortran routine for single hard nucleon - nucleon sub - collision pyquen was constructed as a modification of the jet event obtained with the generator of hadron - hadron interactions pythia@xmath106.4",
    "the event - by - event simulation procedure in pyquen includes _ 1 ) _ generation of initial parton spectra with pythia and production vertexes at given impact parameter ; _ 2 ) _ rescattering - by - rescattering simulation of the parton path in a dense zone and its radiative and collisional energy loss ; _ 3 ) _ final hadronization according to the lund string model for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons .",
    "then the pyquen multi - jets generated according to the binomial distribution are included in the hard part of the event .",
    "the mean number of jets produced in an aa event is the product of the number of binary nn sub - collisions at a given impact parameter and the integral cross section of the hard process in @xmath11 collisions with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath12 . in order to take into account the effect of nuclear shadowing on parton distribution functions",
    ", the impact parameter dependent parameterization obtained in the framework of glauber - gribov theory  @xcite is used .",
    "the soft part of hydjet++ event is the `` thermal '' hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze - out hypersurfaces obtained from the parameterization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze - out conditions ( the adapted c++ code fast mc  @xcite ) .",
    "hadron multiplicities are calculated using the effective thermal volume approximation and poisson multiplicity distribution around its mean value , which is supposed to be proportional to the number of participating nucleons at a given impact parameter of aa collision .",
    "the fast soft hadron simulation procedure includes _ 1 ) _ generation of the 4-momentum of a hadron in the rest frame of a liquid element in accordance with the equilibrium distribution function ; _ 2 ) _ generation of the spatial position of a liquid element and its local 4-velocity in accordance with phase space and the character of motion of the fluid ; _ 3 ) _ the standard von neumann rejection / acceptance procedure to account for the difference between the true and generated probabilities ; _ 4 ) _ boost of the hadron 4-momentum in the center mass frame of the event ; _ 5 ) _ the two- and three - body decays of resonances with branching ratios taken from the share particle decay table  @xcite . the high generation speed in hydjet++",
    "is achieved due to almost 100% generation efficiency of the `` soft '' part because of the nearly uniform residual invariant weights which appear in the freeze - out momentum and coordinate simulation .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite that fast mc model can describe well the bulk properties of hadronic state created in au+au collisions at rhic at @xmath13 gev ( such as particle number ratios , low - p@xmath2 spectra , elliptic flow coefficients @xmath14 , femtoscopic correlations in central collisions ) , while hydjet model is capable of reproducing the main features of jet quenching pattern at rhic ( high-@xmath1 hadron spectra and the suppression of azimuthal back - to - back correlations )  @xcite .",
    "since soft and hard hadronic states in hydjet++ are simulated independently , a good description of hadroproduction at rhic in a wide kinematic range can be achieved , moreover a number of improvements in fast mc and hydjet have been done as compared to earlier versions .",
    "a number of input parameters of the model can be fixed from fitting the rhic data to various physical observables  @xcite .    1",
    ".   * ratio of hadron abundances . *",
    "it is well known that the particle abundances in heavy ion collisions in a wide energy range can be reasonable well described within statistical models based on the assumption that the produced hadronic matter reaches thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the thermodynamical potentials @xmath15 gev , @xmath16 gev , @xmath17 , the strangeness suppression factor @xmath18 , and the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath19 gev have been fixed in  @xcite from fitting the rhic data to various particle ratios near mid - rapidity in central au+au collisions at @xmath13 gev ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) .",
    "* low-@xmath1 hadron spectra . *",

    "the slopes of these spectra allow the thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath36 gev and the maximal transverse flow rapidity in central collisions @xmath37 to be fixed .",
    "* femtoscopic correlations . * because of the effects of quantum statistics and final state interactions , the momentum ( hbt ) correlation functions of two or more particles at small relative momenta in their c.m.s .",
    "are sensitive to the space - time characteristics of the production process on the level of @xmath38 .",
    "the space - time parameters of thermal freeze - out region in central au+au collisions at @xmath13 gev have been fixed in  @xcite by means of fitting the three - dimensional correlation functions measured for @xmath39 pairs and extracting the correlation radii @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 fm/@xmath44 , @xmath45 fm/@xmath44 , @xmath46 fm .",

    "[ hydjet - rhic ] , left ) .",
    "since mean `` soft '' and `` hard '' hadron multiplicities depend on the centrality in different ways ( they are roughly proportional to @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively ) , the relative contribution of soft and hard parts to the total event multiplicity can be fixed through the centrality dependence of @xmath51 .",

    "* high-@xmath1 hadron spectra .",

    "6 .   * elliptic flow . *",
    "the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath58 ( which is determined as the second - order fourier coefficient in the hadron distribution over the azimuthal angle @xmath59 relative to the reaction plane angle @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 ) is an important signature of the physics dynamics at early stages of non - central heavy ion collisions . according to the typical hydrodynamic scenario , the values @xmath62 at low-@xmath1 ( @xmath63 gev/@xmath44 ) are determined mainly by the internal pressure gradients of an expanding fireball during the initial high density phase of the reaction ( and it is sensitive to the momentum and azimuthal anisotropy parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the frameworks of hydjet++ ) , while elliptic flow at high-@xmath1 is generated in hydjet++ ( as well as in other jet quenching models ) due to the partonic energy loss in an azimuthally asymmetric volume of qgp .",

    "note that the choice of these parameters does not affect any azimuthally integrated physics observables ( such as hadron multiplicities , @xmath47- and @xmath1-spectra , etc . ) , but only their differential azimuthal dependences .",

    "<S> one of the important perturbative ( `` hard '' ) probes of hot and dense qcd matter is the medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , so called `` jet quenching '' , which is predicted to be very different in cold nuclear matter and in qgp , and leads to a number of phenomena which are already seen in the rhic data on the qualitative level . the inclusion of jet quenching and other important collective effects , such as radial and elliptic flows , in the existing monte - carlo models of relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> some issues on the corresponding physical observables at rhic and lhc energies obtained with hydjet++ model are presented . </S>"
