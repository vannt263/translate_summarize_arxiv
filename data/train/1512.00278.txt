    "a significant fraction of stars are born in binary and multiple systems .",
    "statistics of their orbital parameters bear traces of formation history and help understanding its physics .",
    "binary - star formation is an essential piece in such fundamental areas as stellar mass function , formation of planetary systems , and binary / stellar population synthesis .",
    "recent review of binary statistics by @xcite focuses on multiplicity fractions , periods , and mass ratios , mentioning the eccentricity distribution only briefly . yet",
    ", eccentricity is an important diagnostic of binary formation .",
    "it is generally recognised that dynamical interactions in stellar systems produce binaries with `` thermal '' eccentricity distribution @xmath8 , predicted from general considerations by @xcite . on the other hand , binaries with mean eccentricities below 0.5 are formed in hydro - dynamical simulations as a result of dissipative interaction with surrounding gas which also decreases binary separations @xcite . from this perspective , spectroscopic binaries should have lower eccentricities than wider visual binaries , and a general trend of increasing eccentricity with binary period is expected .",
    "the relation between eccentricity and binary period , noted a long time ago , has been controversial ever since . while tidal circularisation at periods shorter than @xmath910 days is well established , the situation at longer periods is not clear .",
    "@xcite studied a small sample of nearby solar - type stars and found that at periods between 10 and 1000 days the mean eccentricity is 0.31 , same as in nearby open clusters and halo . at longer periods , they found a `` bell - shaped '' eccentricity distribution and suggested that after correction of selection biases the data are compatible with the thermal distribution .",
    "in other words , they confirmed the period - eccentricity relation and implied that close and wide binaries were formed by different processes .",
    "however , @xcite have not found any dependence of eccentricity on period at @xmath10 days in a similarly complete but larger sample ; for 82 such binaries in their sample the mean eccentricity is 0.47 .",
    "the eccentricity distribution appears uniform in the range [ 0 - 0.6 ] and falls at larger values ( see their fig .",
    "so far , studies of the eccentricity distribution were based on orbital elements , both spectroscopic and visual .",
    "long - term radial - velocity monitoring can achieve a complete census of orbits in a given sample ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "visual orbits are often constrained by the limited time coverage that extends only to @xmath11 years in the best cases . while the discovery of visual binaries does not depend on the eccentricity , the orbit calculation does , introducing `` computational selection '' in the orbit catalogs @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite used visual orbit catalogs in their analysis of nearby samples .",
    "based also on the catalogs of spectroscopic and visual orbits , @xcite found that the average eccentricity of late - type stars increases with period and saturates at @xmath12 at @xmath13 days .",
    "these findings , however , are likely biased by the computational selection inherent to the orbit catalogs .    in this paper we study the eccentricity distribution of wide visual binaries by a new method that does not rely on orbit calculation",
    ". it can access binaries with periods longer than 1000 years without computational selection bias .",
    "the idea is to use the direction and speed of the observed orbital motion .",
    "only a short arc needs to be covered by the data .",
    "the statistics of the observed quasi - linear motion depend on the eccentricity distribution , which then can be reconstructed from the observational data without computing the orbits @xcite .",
    "this method has been used previously by @xcite ; it will benefit from precise _ gaia _ astrometry in the near future .",
    "the method is explained in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "then in section  [ sec : data ] we present the input data : a sample of solar - type visual binaries within 67pc .",
    "simulations are described in section  [ sec : simulations ] , the derived eccentricity distribution is given in section  [ sec : res ] , with the details of the restoration technique provided in the appendix .",
    "the paper closes with the discussion of the results and summary in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "]    figure  [ fig : diag ] explains the idea .",
    "when only a short segment of the orbit is observed , we can measure the speed of the relative orbital motion @xmath14 and the angle @xmath15 of the orbital motion relative to the vector joining the binary components . a circular orbit",
    "seen `` face - on '' will have @xmath16 , while for an eccentric orbit we expect a near - radial motion with @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "for binaries seen in projection on the sky at random orbital phases , statistical distributions of @xmath15 and @xmath14 still depend on the eccentricity . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that binary orbits are oriented randomly ( isotropically ) relative to the line of sight .    here",
    "we extend the method of @xcite by considering both parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "hereafter they are called linear motion parameters ( lmps ) .",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath19 brings more information than just @xmath15 alone .",
    "note however that while @xmath15 is a purely geometric parameter , the interpretation of @xmath14 requires knowledge of parallax and mass .",
    "radial velocity difference between the components is yet another observable parameter that depends on the eccentricity ; it is not exploited here .",
    "there are several obstacles to our project .",
    "first , the lmps of wide binaries can be distorted by motions in subsystems .",
    "for this reason we base our work on the fg-67 sample of solar - type stars within 67pc @xcite .",
    "this sample is large enough , while the subsystem census is reasonably good .",
    "second , wide binaries move slowly and their motion may not be measurable from the available data .",
    "this limits the largest separations and longest periods amenable to such study .",
    "third , we must avoid biases .",
    "for example , if we use only binaries with detectable motion , a bias on @xmath14 ( and hence on eccentricity ) could be introduced . however",
    ", removal of some systems from the statistical sample for lack of sufficient data is independent of their ( unknown ) eccentricity , hence it should not bias the result .",
    "orbits and periods of wide binaries are not known .",
    "we use the projected separation @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the angular separation , @xmath22 is the parallax ) as a proxy of the semi - major axis @xmath23 .",
    "the third kepler law allows a statistical estimate of the orbital period that we denote by @xmath24 , to avoid confusion with the true period @xmath25 .",
    "so , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass sum in solar units and @xmath24 is in years .",
    "the characteristic orbital velocity is @xmath28 au  yr@xmath29 . we multiply it by the parallax , converting to arcsec  yr@xmath29 , and obtain the characteristic speed of the relative orbital motion @xmath30 as @xmath31 strong dependence on the parallax @xmath22 calls for selecting nearby stars .",
    "also , close binaries move faster , but we are interested here in wide binaries ! the sample is constructed by imposing some minimum value of @xmath32 .",
    "this is equivalent to an upper limit on separation @xmath33 that depends on mass and distance , @xmath34    simulations show that the ratio @xmath35 is a random quantity depending on the orbital phase , projection , and eccentricity .",
    "its median value is about 0.5 .",
    "we compare the observed distributions of the normalised motion @xmath36 and @xmath15 with the results of simulations .",
    "it can be easily proven that a bound binary system has @xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath38 criterion of @xcite . when the relative motion is faster than this , the double star is an optical pair @xcite .",
    "considering measurement errors , we adopt a slightly relaxed criterion @xmath39 for physical pairs .",
    "our main sample consists of solar - type binary systems within 67pc from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fg-67 ) with projected separations @xmath40au .",
    "the initial selection of 886 physical pairs was further filtered by the criterion @xmath41mas",
    "yr@xmath29 , leaving 344 objects .",
    "this restriction is dictated by the accuracy of lmp determination from the available data .",
    "the masses of both components ( including known subsystems ) needed for the calculation of @xmath30 are taken from the fg-67 compilation , the parallaxes are from @xcite .",
    "the main sample was complemented by additional binaries from the _ hipparcos _ catalog with parallax larger than 15mas and projected separation larger than 50au ( minimum separation of 075 at a distance of 67pc ) .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ catalog lists only binaries with separations up to @xmath44 , restricting the maximum projected separations .",
    "stars that already belong to the main sample were excluded from the extension . for stars with masses less than @xmath45 , _ hipparcos _ is not complete to 67pc , so the extended sample is also not complete , while still being volume - limited .",
    "visual magnitudes of the components of the extended sample were taken from the washington double star catalog ( wds , * ? ? ?",
    "masses were estimated from absolute magnitudes in the @xmath46 band using standard relations for main sequence , as in @xcite .",
    "objects with primary mass larger than 2@xmath47 were removed ( 22 total ) , as their masses are not determined well by the standard relations . then the characteristic speed @xmath30 was computed and only binaries with @xmath41mas  yr@xmath29 were kept .",
    "this left 231 binaries in the extended sample .",
    "the combined sample thus contains 575 entries .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample ] shows projected separations versus distance and the selection limits of our samples . as explained below , only 85% of binaries are included in the statistical analysis , the rest having insufficient data for lmp determination .",
    "the census of subsystems in the fg-67 paper is as complete as possible , with well - known detection limits ( @xmath980% complete for subsystems in the primary components and @xmath950% for the secondary subsystems ) . in the extended sample , however , the detection of subsystems is less complete .",
    "it was cross - checked with the latest ( 2010 ) version of the multiple star catalog @xcite , revealing only 27 pairs with subsystems out of 231 .",
    "the combined list contains 113 multiples ( 88 subsystems in the primary , 40 in the secondary , 15 in both ) .",
    "overall , 20% of wide binaries in the combined sample and 25% in the main sample contain known inner subsystems . in a population simulated according to the prescription of @xcite , 48% of binaries with periods from @xmath6 to @xmath7 days have subsystems .",
    "orbital periods of most subsystems are shorter than the time span of the data , so they should not distort the lmps .",
    "there are a few notable exceptions , however , such as hip  17129 .",
    "some binaries have even wider components , but this circumstance is neglected in the present work .",
    "measurements of the relative positions of selected binary stars ( time , position angle , separation ) were obtained from the wds on our request . apart from the _ hipparcos _ number , each binary is identified by its wds code based on j2000 coordinates and by the discoverer code ; the latter discriminates between several catalog entries with the same wds code , e.g. resolved subsystems .",
    "the reference time moment @xmath50 is the average time of observations , as in such case the slope and mean value are not correlated .",
    "the four lmps are @xmath51 .",
    "motion of binaries is better represented by linear models in polar coordinates than in rectangular coordinates @xmath52 ( consider a circular face - on orbit for example ) .",
    "the lmps are computed from the measured speed of relative angular and radial motions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the errors of the fitted lmps are computed in the standard way .",
    "we assume that all lpms are statistically independent and determine the errors of @xmath14 and @xmath15 accordingly as @xmath57 , \\\\",

    "the dashed and solid lines connect the first and last positions , respectively , with the primary component located at coordinate origin outside the plot .",
    "the dotted arc is a linear motion in polar coordinates .",
    "points deviating by more than @xmath58 from the fit in either @xmath21 or @xmath48 were rejected iteratively ( they are plotted as crosses ) .",
    "all remaining measurements ( squares ) are considered with equal weights .",
    "observations of some binaries cover a substantial arc . in such situations , we separated the data into segments with angular motion of no more than @xmath59 .",
    "we also require each data segment to contain at least three points and to cover the time interval of no less than two years .",
    "the lmps computed over the last data segment ( typically the most accurate ) are taken as the final values .",
    "the quality and quantity of available data is very diverse ; in some cases the measurements have a strong scatter and the lmps are determined with large errors . in a few cases , one or two strongly deviant measurements were deleted manually .",
    "for some binaries , the data are not sufficient .",
    "this happens for recently discovered pairs with a short time coverage and for binaries with only a few measurements of low accuracy .",
    "several binaries with @xmath60 also fall in this category , as measurement errors usually increase with separation .",
    "these pairs were excluded from the statistical analysis .",
    "we also excluded binaries with errors of @xmath15 exceeding @xmath61 .",
    "all binaries are physical , as their relative motion is slow enough ( @xmath39 , see section  [ sec : rel ] ) .    for some binaries in our sample we found visual orbits in the sixth catalog of orbits of visual binary stars , vb6 @xcite . considering only 150 orbits with periods shorter that 2500yr , we computed the lmps for the same moments @xmath50 from the orbital elements and used those .",
    "comparison of `` orbital '' and directly derived lmps shows their excellent agreement , which is natural because both are based on the same observations . in the extended sample ,",
    "we did not request the observations of orbital pairs from the wds and simply used their orbits to compute the lmps for @xmath62 .    for pairs with",
    "known visual orbits , the fg-67 database lists semi - major axis instead of separation .",
    "we removed from the sample orbital binaries with projected separations less than 40au ; they were included by error because their semi - major axis exceeds 50au .",
    "however , 13 orbital binaries with separations between 40 and 50 au were retained . on the other hand ,",
    "some orbital pairs with semi - major axis less than 50au but projected separations exceeding 50au were rejected initially , but later recovered in the extended sample and moved back to the main sample .",
    "the combined sample contains 575 wide binaries , but only 477 pairs with good data are left for statistical analysis .",
    "the median parameters of the main , extended , and combined samples are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] . as expected , the extended sample has a smaller mass of primary components and is on average located at closer distance compared to the main sample .",
    "the last line of the table characterises the simulated sample ( section  [ sec : samp ] ) .",
    "orbital periods @xmath24 estimated from projected separations are mostly comprised between @xmath6 and @xmath7 days , i.e. on the right - hand side of the maximum in the period distribution at @xmath6 days @xcite . as we deal here with resolved visual binaries , their mass ratios are mostly above 0.5 ( median 0.75 ) .       instead of modelling the eccentricity distribution by 5 bins",
    ", we can describe it by a linear function @xmath63 or by a combination of thermal , uniform , and sine distributions ( like a linear or quadratic polynomial ) .",
    "this alternative model requires only two or three basis functions and has one or two unknown parameters .",
    "it was also tested by simulations and fitted to the real data ."
