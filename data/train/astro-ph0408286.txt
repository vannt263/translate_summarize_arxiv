    "hr4049 is a post - agb star member of a binary system with period of 429 days and high eccentricity , @xmath5=0.3 .",
    "hr4049 is the prototype of a group of post - agb stars in binary systems showing a high degree of metal depletion , @xmath6 4 dex @xcite .",
    "the key to this feature is probably the presence of a massive , stable , long - lived and dusty circumbinary disk : after dust forms in the disk the gas depleted of refractory elements is re - accreted by the star , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "oxygen isotopic ratios have been measured from co@xmath4 molecules likely residing in the disk @xcite .",
    "these ratios are extremely anomalous : @xmath0o/@xmath1o = 8.3 @xmath7 2.3 and @xmath0o/@xmath3o = 6.9 @xmath7 0.9 , as illustrated in figure [ fig : oxygen ] they are one to more than two orders of magnitude lower than observed in any evolved star ! such a composition can not be produced in agb and post - agb stars because their composition is characterised by the effect of he burning , during which @xmath1o   and @xmath3o   are destroyed , and proton - capture processes during which @xmath1o   is produced , but not to the level shown by hr4049 , and @xmath3o   is destroyed .",
    "if the companion of hr4049 is a white dwarf ( wd ) , accretion from hr4049 could have triggered nova outbursts in the same way as predicted @xcite and observed @xcite in some symbiotic systems .",
    "the nova ejecta could have been partly intercepted by hr4049 or the circumbinary disk , to produce the observed anomalous oxygen ratios .",
    "the mass of hr4049 is between 0.56  0.67 @xmath8   and the mass function of the system is @xmath9=0.158 @xmath7 0.004 .",
    "the estimated inclination is @xmath10 60 degrees @xcite .",
    "hence the mass of the companion can be estimated to be around 0.75 ",
    "0.82 @xmath8 , which indicates we should look into nova models with a co white dwarf .",
    "oxygen isotopic ratios for co nova models are shown in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "results depend on several parameters : the mass , temperature and luminosity of the wd , the accretion rate , the composition of the envelope produced by the accreted material and the level of mixing of wd material into this envelope . in order to be able to match the observed ratio @xmath0o/@xmath1o   @xmath11  8",
    "is needed .",
    "nova models appear to allow such composition , depending on the choice of parameters .",
    "note also that variations of the @xmath0o(@xmath12 ) , @xmath1o(@xmath12 ) and @xmath1o(@xmath13 ) reaction rates within their uncertainties give rise to @xmath1o   abundances changes by factor @xmath11 30 @xcite .",
    ".ranges of oxygen isotopic ratios from nova models [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    isotopic ratios of @xmath0o/@xmath3o   presented by ref .",
    "@xcite for co nova models are also shown in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "these nova models do not produce the observed ratio , requiring @xmath0o/@xmath3o   @xmath11 7 .",
    "however , the final abundance of @xmath3o   originates predominantly from the decay of @xmath3f , whose abundance is very sensitive to @xmath3f(@xmath13 ) , @xmath1o(@xmath12 ) and @xmath1o(@xmath13 ) reaction - rate variations . within rates uncertainties , the @xmath3f abundance changes by factors of @xmath11 100 @xcite",
    "thus , within current uncertainties also the required @xmath0o/@xmath3o   ratio could be produced by co nova models .",
    "the main question in relation to the nova scenario is whether the companion of hr4049 is really a wd .",
    "there is no sign of the presence of a wd in the ultraviolet spectrum so that , if there is one , its temperature must be lower than @xmath10 20,000 k @xcite .",
    "if the wd is still accreting from hr4049 winds it could emit x - rays .",
    "rosat observations suggest that there might be a marginal detection about 20  away from hr4049 position , on the edge of being compatible with the positional accuracy of rosat ( f. verbunt , personal communication ) .",
    "a more sensitive observational test can be obtained making use of the higher resolution of chandra .",
    "many other issues are open with regards to the evolution of the system . with a separation of 190 r@xmath14 ,",
    "the roche - lobe radius is @xmath10 76 r@xmath14 .",
    "the radius of hr4049 at the tip of the agb would have been @xmath10 250 r@xmath14 , much larger than the roche - lobe radius .",
    "several scenarios can be proposed for the evolution of this binary system .",
    "for example , if the system initially had a larger separation nova outbursts could have been triggered by wind accretion before dynamically unstable roche - lobe overflow resulted in common envelope evolution and orbital shrinkage .",
    "alternately , if the mass ratio reached a value smaller than about 2/3 the system could have undergone stable roche - lobe overflow for some time and triggered nova outbursts .",
    "however , in either case it is difficult to account for the current high eccentricity of the binary system .",
    "the compositions of a few presolar sic and graphite grains indicate a nova origin @xcite .",
    "there a few open problems and questions related to this origin : ( i ) mixing between nova and more normal material is needed , ( ii ) c / o@xmath151 is not typically produced by novae , but is a necessary condition to condensate sic and graphite , and ( iii ) grain compositions indicate an one nova origin , but where are the grains from co novae ?    if we consider as a site of grain formation the circumbinary disks around evolved stars , such as that around hr4049 , we can find solutions to the three problems listed above .",
    "( i ) in a circumbinary disk nova material could be mixed with red giant material .",
    "( ii ) material from the red giant stars could be carbon rich and , finally , as illustrated in figure [ fig : grains ] , ( iii ) grains originating from material affected by co nova nucleosynthesis could be found among grains belonging to the a and b sic populations , whose composition has so far remained unexplained @xcite .",
    "an objection to this scenario is that there are few circumbinary disks around evolved stars and not all of them could have experienced nova nucleosynthesis .",
    "how can they produce a significant fraction ( few percent ) of the recovered meteoritic presolar sic grains ?",
    "a possible explanation is that many presolar meteoritic sic grains , which have relatively large sizes up to a few @xmath16 m , could have been _ preferentially _ produced in circumbinary disks , rather than in single - star outflows @xcite .",
    "the o composition of hr4049 could represent the first time that isotopic ratios showing the signature of nova nucleosynthesis are measured in a stellar environment .",
    "this composition could have resulted from nova outbursts if : ( i ) the companion of hr4049 is a wd and ( ii ) the @xmath3f(@xmath13 ) rate is close to its lower limit , so that @xmath3o   can be produced to the same level as @xmath1o .",
    "dedicated nova models are needed to address the issue .",
    "many problems related to the system dynamics are still open .",
    "a significant fraction of presolar sic grains could have originated in circumbinary disks with material being affected by nova nucleosynthesis ."
