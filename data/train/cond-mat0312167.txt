    "it is known that the higher end of the distribution of income @xmath0 follows the pareto law @xcite , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the income ( money ) and the exponent @xmath3 has a value in the interval @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "an explanation of the pareto law , in terms of the laws regulating the system micro - dynamics , should take into account its basic constituents , i.e. the trading agents , as well as the criteria used to carry out the economic transactions .",
    "several studies have been made to provide an explanation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a brief summary and more references ) . in this respect",
    ", it is of general interest to study some simple systems of closed economy , which can be either solved exactly or simulated numerically , in order to investigate the relation between the micro - dynamics and the resulting macroscopic money distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the generalization of a simple model of money conserving economy , realized by introducing a criterion of saving in the transaction law , through the saving propensity @xmath6 .",
    "we study numerically its asymptotic money distribution as a function of the model parameters .",
    "we show that it is not a gibbs distribution and , by direct comparison with numerical data , that the corresponding analytical solution has the form of a poisson distribution .",
    "in the simple model considered @xcite , @xmath7 agents can exchange money in pairs between themselves . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that all the agents are initially assigned the same money amount @xmath8 , despite this condition is not restrictive for the following results .",
    "agents are then let to interact .",
    "at every `` time step '' , a pair @xmath9 is randomly chosen and the transaction takes place . during the transaction ,",
    "the agent money amounts @xmath10 and @xmath11 undergo a variation , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "money is assumed to be conserved during the transaction , so that @xmath14 in this basic model , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are obtained through a random reassignment of the total money @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a random number , extracted from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath20 .",
    "notice that this model of dynamics , as well as its variations considered in the following , ensures that agents have no debts after the transaction , i.e. they are always left with a money amount @xmath21 .",
    "it can be shown that , merely as a consequence of the conservation law ( [ conservation ] ) , the system relaxes toward an equilibrium state characterized by a gibbs distribution  @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the inverse average money and @xmath24 .",
    "this means that after relaxation , the majority of the agents has a very small amount of money , while the number of richest agents ",
    "e.g. those with @xmath2 larger than a given value @xmath25 , as well as the fraction of the total money they own , exponentially decreases with @xmath25 .",
    "the gibbs distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) has been shown to represent a robust equilibrium state , reached independently of the initial conditions also in generalized models , such as those involving multi - agent transactions .    however ,",
    "if a saving criterion is introduced @xcite , i.e. agents save a fraction @xmath6  the saving propensity  of the money they have before the transaction is made , the shape of the equilibrium distribution changes dramatically .",
    "the conservation equation ( [ conservation ] ) still holds , but the money to be shared in a transaction between the @xmath26-th and the @xmath27-th agent is now @xmath28 .",
    "then eqs .",
    "( [ basic ] ) are thus modified , @xmath29 these equations can also be rewritten in the following way , @xmath30 \\ ,    \\label{sp2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which clearly shows how money is conserved during the transaction .",
    "we performed numerical simulations , for various values of @xmath6 , of a system with @xmath31 agents . in each simulation a sufficient number of transactions , as far as @xmath32 , depending on the value of @xmath6 , was used in order to reach equilibrium .",
    "the final equilibrium distributions for a given @xmath6 , obtained by averaging over @xmath33 different runs , are shown in fig .",

    "( [ gibbs ] ) . here",
    "we give the corresponding exact solution for an generic value of @xmath6 , with @xmath35 .",
    "this solution was found by fitting the results of numerical simulations and it turns out to fit extremely well all data .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the reduced variable @xmath36 the agent money in units of the average money @xmath37 , and the parameter @xmath38 we found that the money distributions , for arbitrary values of @xmath6 , are well fitted by the function @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined in eqs .",
