    "among all observables for determining the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy ion collisions , the electromagnetic probes such as photons and dileptons are expected to provide clean signitures due to their instant emissions once produced @xcite .",
    "these thermal photons and dileptons contain undistorted information about the space - time trace of the new state of matter formed in such collisions .",
    "there are many sources of dileptons in heavy ion collisions . in the lower invariant mass region ( @xmath31 gev )",
    "dileptons are mainly from resonance decays and may be related to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . in the higher invariant mass region ( @xmath4 gev )",
    "dileptons are dominated by the drell - yan process and charmonium decays . for moderate invariant mass dileptons ( @xmath5 gev )",
    ", it was argued that dileptons from semileptonic decays of correlated open charm in @xmath6 collisions are dominant @xcite .",
    "but in au+au collisions , both charm related single lepton contributions and their dynamic correlations are expected to be suppressed by medium modification . therefore thermal radiation may play important role in the intermediate mass region and the dilepton spectra can be used to extract thermodynamic parameters of the fireball .",
    "the observation of jet quenching and strong elliptic flow at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory tell us that the dense matter produced at rhic interacts strongly and may reach local thermalization in very short time @xcite , implying that ideal hydrodynamic models are applicable to such systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to hadronic flow , the observables of dileptons are more direct and penetrating probes to the early space - time profile of the qgp @xcite .",
    "the radial flow of thermal dileptons has been measured at cern super - proton synchrotron ( sps ) by the na60 collaboration @xcite .",
    "it was found that the inverse slope parameter @xmath7 increases with the invariant mass @xmath8 of the lepton pair below the @xmath9 meson mass and then starts decreasing above @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the drop of @xmath7 around @xmath10 gev is not fully understood although it was thought to be an indication of the transition to an emission source with much smaller flow possibly a partonic source @xcite .",
    "the observed strong correlation of @xmath7 versus @xmath8 in the region @xmath11 gev is mainly due to the collectivity developed in the hadronic stage at sps energies .",
    "should the collectivity have been developed in the partonic phase of the evolution in high energy nuclear collisions , rhic and/or lhc , one would also expect to see the increase of @xmath7 in the intermediate mass region @xmath5 gev .",
    "inspired by the na60 result and in order to develope clean observables for the formation of the qgp , we propose to study the transverse momentum distributions of di - electrons over the entire region of @xmath12 gev .",
    "in this paper we use a 2 + 1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamic model to give the space - time evolution of the medium created in au+au collisions at @xmath0200 gev .",

    "we note that the region of @xmath100 gev probes earlier stage of the fireball , where the qgp emission dominates over the hadronic emission .",

    "if there is only one phase in the course of the evolution , these distinct feature will disappear .",
    "the initial temperature of the qgp phase in eos containing the qgp phase is much higher than that of the pure hg phase in hg - eos at the same initial energy density .",
    "so the early stage emission from the former is much larger than that from the latter ( since yield is proportional to @xmath107 ) , then the later stage emission for hg - eos has much larger proportion in the total yield .",
    "this helps us understand the bigger elliptic flow of hg - eos than that of other eos containing the qgp phase in the intermediate mass region .",

    "the peaks at the @xmath9 meson mass in the mix - eos and lat - eos cases and the increase in the small mass region are partially caused by the surface emission , but the main reason is the influence of the qgp phase in the region below the @xmath9 meson mass @xcite .",
    "we also note that if the qgp is created , the dilepton spectrum in the mass region between the @xmath51 meson mass and @xmath108 mass depends approximately only on its transverse mass @xmath2 .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndptdm02 ] ) , after the integration over azimuthal angle @xmath109 , the differential yield is proportional to @xmath110 . in the continuum region , the lepton mass , the quark mass and the collectivity are negligible , then the yield is only a function of @xmath2 .",
