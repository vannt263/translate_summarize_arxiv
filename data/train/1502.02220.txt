    "ghost imaging ( gi ) is a promising imaging technique based on the classical or quantum correlation of the light field fluctuations , which can realize the reconstruction of an object by means of intensity correlation of two light beams , i.e. , the object beam and the reference beam .",
    "the first gi experiment was performed by using two - photon entangled light generated in spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "subsequently a lot of works are focused on gi with thermal sources because it may be useful in practical application @xcite . in recent years",
    ", a significant number of theoretical and experimental schemes about gi have been presented , such as computational gi @xcite , compressive gi @xcite , differential gi @xcite , and high - order gi @xcite . among them , computational gi was first proposed theoretically by shapiro @xcite . compared with the standard pseudothermal gi ,",
    "one advantage of computational gi is that only a simple detector of single - pixel resolution is needed in the test path and replaces high spatial - resolution detector of the reference beam with a computation of the propagating field .",
    "computational gi leads to single - pixel imaging employing structured illumination , which simplifies the implementation of an imaging system .",
    "silberberg _ et al .",
    "_ first achieved computational gi in experiment by using only a single detector , where the essence is to replace the rotating diffuser with a computer - controlled spatial light modulator ( slm ) @xcite .",
    "then , in some computational gi schemes , a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) is used to generate random spatial distribution as an slm @xcite .",
    "recently , sun _",
    "et al . _ demonstrated three - dimensional @xcite and full - color @xcite computational imaging by replacing the slm and laser with a digital light projector ( dlp ) and using several single - pixel detectors in different locations .",
    "this technique has attracted great interest @xcite .",
    "but until recently , an slm or dmd or dlp is necessary in the computational gi schemes .",
    "these devices are costly or difficult to modulate .",
    "meanwhile , the major drawbacks of computational gi include having to integrate and average over thousands of frames , requiring large computer storage space , long processing time and fast detectors . due to gi s significant application value",
    ", it is getting more and more attention .",
    "hence , how to improve the image quality with simple and practical devices becomes the research focus .    in this paper",
    ", we proposed a new experimental scheme for computational gi , where structured illumination and a single - pixel detector are used .",
    "a general liquid crystal display ( lcd ) is used as light source , the pseudo - randomly patterns directly generated by the computer on the display do structured illumination , and this computer performs the reconstructions of the test object .",
    "this greatly simplifies the control process of light source in computational gi , and there is no need to modulate slm by programming .",
    "this structured illumination can greatly reduce the number of measurements required for a faithful reconstruction . in the meantime ,",
    "the experimental setup in this work is very simple and has excellent robustness to external light sources of noise .",
    "therefore , our current work offers great potential for future implementations of gi in practical applications .",
    "this experimental setup is shown in figure  [ 1 ] . in traditional computational gi ,",
    "a computer - controlled slm is utilized , which works as a controlled phase mask for the spatial phase of the light field [ fig .  [ 1](a ) ] .",
    "a pseudothermal light beam is generated by applying phase patterns on a slm irradiated by laser @xcite .",
    "a spatially incoherent light beam is generated by applying pseudo - random phase patterns on a slm .",
    "our ghost imaging system replaces the laser and slm with a general computer lcd [ fig .  [ 1](b ) ] .",
    "the optical setup can be divided into two parts : the illumination system and the collection system , located before and behind of the object , respectively . in the illumination system ,",
    "the lcd is used as light source , the pseudo - randomly patterns are directly generated by the computer on the lcd screen .",
    "suppose the light source ( here the lcd screen ) is located at @xmath0 , an imaging lens ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) is located at @xmath3 , an object ` h ' with the size of @xmath4 is located at @xmath5 .",
    "the collection system is consists of a lens and a single - pixel detector .",
    "this lens is used to collect all transmitted light through the object onto the bucket detector .",
    "here we use the computer lcd screen ( dell e176fp , 17  inch , dot pitch 0.264  mm , screen ratio @xmath6 ) . without loss of generality , our experimental scheme with other lcd screens",
    "can also be achieved .",
    "the light source in our experimental setup has a good stability and high imaging quality .",
    "normally , ghost imaging experiment needs to be done in the dark since all external sources of light would interfere with the recorded voltage from the single - pixel detector during the data acquisition process .",
    "nevertheless , we proved that we can also obtain a clear image of the object even in the presence of external light sources , which indicates that our system is very robust . to sum up",
    ", high - quality reconstruction can be achieved by making use of the simple and robust experimental setup in our scheme .",
    "we firstly generate a series of patterns in the screen used as the sources .",
    "these sources are labeled as @xmath7 . in current experiments ,",
    "these @xmath8 are generated by a random function in matlab , so that statistically ( @xmath9 is large enough ) @xmath8 should satisfy @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two constants . since the light from different emitters in the computer screen are incoherently distributed , we may consider the imaging lens plays the role of an incoherent imaging system , thus the intensity distribution just before the object ( i.e. , at @xmath5 ) has the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the magnification of the system , and @xmath15 is the point spread function ( psf ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the aperture function of the lens , here @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for other values .    now , the bucket detector will detect a total energy signal @xmath21 where @xmath22 is intensity transmittance .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e40 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath23    the ghost image can be obtained by calculating the intensity correlation between the light sources and the signals of the bucket detector @xmath24 then , substituting eqs .",

( [ e3 ] ) ] .",
    "when there exists no defocusing , i.e. , @xmath26 , the psf is given by the fourier transform of the aperture function @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the 1st order bessel function .",
    "when there exists defocusing , @xmath30 , the psf will be degraded , and the ghost imaging quality will be decreased .",
    "the computational gi with a lcd is demonstrated experimentally by constructing the setup shown in fig .  [ 1](b ) .",
    "a series of binary patterns with the speckle size @xmath31 pixels are generated by the computer on the lcd screen .",
    "the imaging lens is placed at a distance @xmath32 from the lcd , and the transmissive object ` h ' is placed at a distance @xmath33 from the imaging lens .",
    "the other lens behind the object collects the transmitted light onto the bucket detector .",

    "the inset indicates the transmission mask .",
    ", width=211 ]    in the following , we will discuss the possible factors affecting the experiment results in detail .",
    "first , we try to consider the effect of light sources on the quality of the ghost images . due to the algorithms and the fluctuations in matlab functions , statistical distribution of the light sources",
    "may be different , which will further affect the image quality .",
    "we generate @xmath37 random speckle patterns of @xmath35 pixels by using the matlab functions ` rand ' and ` randi ' , respectively .",
    "the correlation property of light sources is simulated in one - dimensional case , as shown in fig .",
    "the simulation results are consistent with the theoretical prediction [ eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) ] .",
    "computation gi experiments with both kinds of pseudo - random speckle patterns are achieved , the results indicate that there is a slight difference for the quality of the reconstructions . in our scheme , a series of pseudo - random binary patterns are utilized .",
    ".,width=288 ]     pixels are used .",
    "( b ) an out - of - focus image reconstructed at a different position @xmath38 .",
    "other experimental parameters are the same as fig .",
    "[ experiment].,title=\"fig:\",width=144 ]   pixels are used .",
    "( b ) an out - of - focus image reconstructed at a different position @xmath38 .",
    "other experimental parameters are the same as fig .",
    "[ experiment].,title=\"fig:\",width=144 ]    in addition , the speckle size may be an important factor to affect image quality .",
    "we firstly generate 4000 speckle patterns with the speckle size @xmath39 pixels using the computer . when the number of measurements is 4000 , the reconstructed image is displayed in fig .",
    "the imaging result is not desirable . if we adjust the speckle size , and use the patterns with the smaller speckles , such as @xmath31 pixels . under the same experimental conditions ,",
    "the object is reconstructed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] .",
    "it is evident that the reconstruction by the patterns with the smaller speckles is much clearer by comparing figs .",
    "[ experiment ] and [ 3](a ) .",
    "the experimental results show that changing the size of speckles is an effective method to improve imaging quality .",
    "the high - quality image can be obtained by making use of the patterns with the appropriate speckle size .",
    "second , the influence of light path on reconstruction quality is also discussed . in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] , the object ` h ' is at a distance @xmath33 from the imaging lens , where the light path satisfies focusing , i.e. , @xmath40 , due to @xmath32 and @xmath41 .",
    "the accurate reconstruction of the object transmission @xmath22 is achieved by using 4000 measurements [ fig .",
    "[ experiment ] ] .",
    "and then we move the object ` h ' to a new position at a distance @xmath38 from the imaging lens so that the light path arises the defocusing case , @xmath42 , reconstruction of an image results in an out - of - focus image of the object , as shown in fig .  [",

    "( a ) @xmath43 ( b ) @xmath44 ( c ) @xmath45 .",

    "other experimental parameters are the same as fig .",
    "[ experiment].,title=\"fig:\",width=115 ]    finally , we investigate the relation between imaging quality and the number of measurements , displaying reconstructed images for different measurements @xmath46 , and @xmath47 in fig .",
    "it is easy to observe that as the number of measurements @xmath9 increases , the quality of reconstructed images enhances significantly .",
    "furthermore , the use of patterns with the appropriate speckle size can reduce the number of measurements needed for image reconstruction , so we can obtain high - quality images using only a small amount of data .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that computational gi can be accomplished with pseudo - randomly distributed patterns in the computer lcd .",
    "the high - quality object image can be reconstructed only by a set of simple and low - cost experimental apparatuses consisting of a general computer and an ordinary single - pixel detector .",
    "the influences of the speckle patterns , defocusing , and the number of measurements on imaging quality are discussed .",
    "the results show that this computational gi technique has the depth - resolving imaging capabilities , and it enables image reconstruction with less measurements by adjusting the speckle size .",
    "furthermore , computation gi with pseudo - randomly patterned illumination from a lcd make to possible to achieve 3d and color imaging .",
    "the presented theoretical framework of structured illumination holds great potential , such as combining with compressive sensing algorithm , light source coding technology and so on .",
    "we find that the source of pseudo - randomly distributed patterns in the computer screen is similar to the true thermal light , which is closer to practical applications , such as single - pixel imaging , light detection and ranging , and fluorescence microscopy .        99 x. f. liu , x. h. chen , x. r. yao , w. k. yu , g. j. zhai , and l. a. wu , opt . lett . * 39 * , 2314 ( 2014 ) .",
