    "the standard model ( sm ) is a renormalizable quantum field theory that makes unambiguous predictions for elementary particle processes over a very large range of energy scales . apart from a possible metastable vacuum",
    ", the sm has no theoretical inconsistencies at least up to the planck scale at which we expect gravity to become strong and quantum field theories to break down .",
    "if this scenario is realized in nature , the higgs mass parameter seems artificially small compared to the planck scale .",
    "however , in the sm itself the higgs mass parameter is the only explicit scale in the theory , and therefore it is only multiplicatively renormalized  @xcite .    an interesting modification of the sm is given by requiring that the higgs mass term vanishes at some very high energy ( uv ) scale ; in this case it will not be generated by sm radiative corrections at lower scales either .",
    "the tree - level potential has only a quartic term , and the full lagrangian is classically scale invariant .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking could be triggered , in principle , by the one - loop corrections to the effective potential @xmath2 in which @xmath3 denotes the renormalization scale and @xmath4 is a loop suppressed function of the couplings .",
    "such a possibility has been envisioned by coleman and weinberg  @xcite",
    ". a very attractive feature of the coleman - weinberg ( cw ) symmetry breaking mechanism is , that for couplings of order 1 at some renormalization scale in the uv , @xmath5 , the minimum of the potential appears at an exponentially smaller scale @xmath6 therefore , similar to the large disparity between the planck scale and the confinement scale of qcd , the large disparity between the planck scale and the electroweak scale is explained through renormalization group running  @xcite .",
    "however , in the sm the cw mechanism is ruled out .",
    "the dominant contribution to the effective potential comes from the top quark , which renders it unbounded from below , since it enters the coefficient @xmath4 in   with a negative sign . in order to overcome the top quark contribution and to reproduce the measured higgs mass",
    ", one would need to extend the sm by bosonic degrees of freedom with sizable couplings to the higgs @xcite .",
    "another motivation for extending the sm is the strong observational evidence for dark matter ( dm ) , plausibly in the form of weakly interacting heavy particles . even in the absence of a higgs mass parameter in the uv",
    ", such particles will generically introduce additive corrections to the higgs mass parameter and spoil the cw dynamics in the absence of additional symmetries .",
    "this motivates an alternative implementation of the cw mechanism , first proposed by hempfling  @xcite . in this model , the higgs couples to one extra scalar , which through dynamics of a hidden sector undergoes cw symmetry breaking and communicates the corresponding mass scale through the higgs portal to the sm .",
    "dark matter can then be given by any of the new hidden sector fields that govern the renormalization group evolution of the scalar potential in the dark sector .",
    "there has been a lot of recent interest in models that implement various aspects of these basic ideas @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on implementations with dark sectors that are fairly simple and thus predictive . in section  [ sec : mot ]",
    "we comment on issues of naturalness as applied to classically scale invariant modificiations of the sm , without claiming to resolve these issues . in section  [ sec : tevdm ] we show , that in extensions of the sm with no explicit mass scales , the combination of a higgs mass term generated through cw symmetry breaking together with the restriction to have a stable vacuum up to the planck scale generically sets an upper bound on the dark matter mass scale of the order of a few tev .",
    "furthermore , the cw mechanism requires sizable couplings for gauge fields in the hidden sector , so that the simplest models in the literature are in addition subject to a lower bound on the dm mass of several hundred gev . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we present a model with additional fermions in the hidden sector that can be dark matter candidates with masses at the electroweak scale or below . in sections  [ sec : higgs ] ,  [ sec : dm ] and  [ sec : out ] , we discuss the collider and dark matter phenomenology of the model . in section  [ sec : out ] , we also comment on further implications of this model for the dynamics of galaxy structure formation and a possible first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : con ] .    the one loop effective potential of the discussed model and the one loop beta functions of the dark sector couplings are collected in appendices  [ sec : veff ] and  [ sec : betafunctions ] . for the beta functions and anomalous dimensions , we follow the methods , conventions and notation of machacek and vaughn @xcite , with the improvements and extensions introduced by luo and xiao @xcite . for the effective potentials , we follow the methods and conventions of martin @xcite .",
    "there are slight differences of notation in the literature : for example compared to @xcite , our scalar self - coupling is twice as large , and our convention for anomalous dimensions has the opposite sign .",
    "a coleman - weinberg mechanism as the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking was first considered by gildener and weinberg  @xcite . in the absence of the higgs mass term",
    ", the lagrangian of the sm exhibits classical scale invariance that is softly broken by quantum effects - the well known scale anomaly . in uv completions of the sm , the physical thresholds associated with new massive states would constitute an explicit breaking of this symmetry .",
    "this introduces the need for a fine - tuning of the bare higgs mass parameter against radiative corrections involving more massive particles .",
    "the fact that the higgs mass parameter is not protected by a symmetry from these radiative corrections is known as the naturalness or hierarchy problem .",
    "if the sm is uv completed by a conformal or supersymmetric ( susy ) theory , the higgs mass parameter is radiatively stable above the scale at which this completion sets in ; thus if this scale is not too high , the hierarchy problem is solved .",
    "this has led to the expectation that such a uv completion is realized in the vicinity of the electroweak scale .",
    "however , the new degrees of freedom predicted by either supersymmetric or conformal uv completions have not been observed , yet .",
    "this raises the prospect that the uv scale at which they set in is considerably higher than the electroweak scale , leaving the naturalness problem unresolved .",
    "there are a number of experimental observations and theoretical questions , unrelated to the naturalness problem , that point to new high energy scales .",
    "neutrino masses , gauge coupling unification , dark matter , and the expectation of a more fundamental theory of gravity are all expected to introduce new scales and as a consequence introduce an additive renormalization of the higgs mass parameter .",
    "none of these arguments , however , _ necessarily _ points to a new uv scale relevant to the hierarchy problem .",
    "neutrinos could be dirac fermions with tiny yukawa couplings , gauge coupling unification may not occur or may not imply new superheavy states , and dark matter could well be related to the electroweak scale itself .",
    "there is still the challenging question of quantum gravity .",
    "we know that gravity does not make sense as a fundamental ( perturbative ) quantum field theory at short distances  @xcite .",
    "naively , the planck scale is expected to correspond at least roughly to a physical threshold where new massive states appear . in string theory",
    "this is indeed the case , and one can also argue that the existence of microscopic black holes is enough to require fine - tuning of the higgs mass parameter @xcite .",
    "a non - perturbative theory of quantum gravity might avoid this problem , but not if it resembles strongly - coupled gauge theories where new massive states are connected to the scale of strong coupling . at present no mechanism",
    "is known that can realize even a toy model for the type of uv completion that would avoid the hierachy problem , despite promising models in 2d  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "all claims about planckian physics and resulting effects on the renormalization of the higgs mass parameter are , at this point , speculative .",
    "generic uv completions of the standard model certainly have a higgs naturalness problem @xcite , but for all we know , spacetime geometry breaks down at the planck scale , and whether this results in a physical cut - off of relevance to the higgs mass parameter is an open question .",
    "following the same line of reasoning , it is not clear to what extent the existence of ultra - planckian landau poles , as occurs for the hypercharge gauge coupling of the sm , should be regarded as a fundamental issue . in particular",
    ", our semi - classical understanding of gravity seems to indicate that such landau poles are unobservable ; the requisite scattering experiments would presumably be dominated by black hole production long before reaching the regime where incipient strong coupling in the hypercharge interactions would show itself .",
    "it is striking that no couplings of the sm run into a landau pole _",
    "below _ the planck scale , which would be an unambigous sign of a new scale and therefore of the need ( presumably ) to fine - tune the higgs mass .    in this paper , we assume that all explicit mass parameters vanish at the planck scale , either as the consequence of the uv completed planckian theory , or in spite of it .",
    "in addition we will focus on extensions of the sm that are weakly coupled and have no vacuum instability below the planck scale .",
    "it is an intriguing observation about the standard model , that it seems to be consistent up to very high mass scales . below the planck scale ,",
    "the only hint for new physics within the sm itself is a possible instability of the electroweak vacuum triggered by the large top yukawa . in the sm",
    ", the observed higgs mass of @xmath7  gev implies a higgs quartic coupling at the electroweak scale of around @xmath8  @xcite . with this infrared boundary condition , assuming central values for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the higgs quartic coupling runs negative at scales around @xmath11  gev and stays at a small negative value @xmath12 up to the planck scale , rendering the electroweak vacuum unstable  @xcite .",
    "the instability can for example be overcome by the extension of the sm by a complex scalar @xmath13 with portal coupling to the higgs @xmath14 , so that the most general scalar potential reads @xmath15 the new scalar can affect the stability of the higgs potential in two ways : ( i ) by changing the beta function of the higgs quartic ; ( ii ) by changing the infrared boundary condition of the higgs quartic .",
    "we briefly review both possibilities .",
    "\\(i ) the portal coupling @xmath16 gives a positive contribution to the beta function of the higgs quartic . at the one loop level we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 and @xmath21 gauge couplings , @xmath22 is the top yukawa coupling and we neglected the contributions from all other yukawa couplings . in the sm ,",
    "the top yukawa contribution , @xmath23 , dominates at low scales and drives the higgs quartic coupling negative .",
    "if @xmath16 is sufficiently large , it can balance the top contribution and stabilize the vacuum . if in addition the vacuum expectation value of the new scalar vanishes , @xmath24 , the scalar can be stable and is a dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) if the new scalar has a non - vanishing vev , @xmath25 , the tree level scalar mass matrix in the broken phase of reads @xmath26                \\lambda_{\\sigma h } \\,w\\ , v &   \\lambda_\\sigma\\,w^2               \\end{pmatrix}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath27 , the light higgs - like mass eigenstate has a mass @xmath28 in order to reproduce a higgs mass of @xmath29  gev , the value of @xmath30 at the electroweak scale has to be larger than in the sm .",
    "in that way the uv instability can be avoided  @xcite . indeed , for a higgs quartic that is about @xmath31 larger than in the sm , @xmath32 , the central value of the higgs quartic remains positive up to high scales and vanishes around the planck mass .",
    "taking into account uncertainties in the running of @xmath30 from the top mass and strong gauge coupling , a positive higgs quartic at the @xmath33 level corresponds to @xmath34 interestingly enough , for such a range of boundary conditions not only the higgs quartic , but also its beta function become zero at scales close to the planck scale",
    ". the required size of the portal coupling to stabilize the potential in the uv is considerably smaller than using mechanism ( i ) .",
    "if the scalar quartic @xmath35 is of the same order of the higgs quartic @xmath30 , a portal coupling of @xmath36 is sufficient .",
    "although the heavy scalar is unstable in scenario ( ii ) , additional fields which get their mass from couplings to @xmath13 could explain dark matter .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the correction in @xmath37 from the heavy scalar persists even in the decoupling limit , @xmath38 , so that both mechanisms to mitigate the vacuum instability do not point to a specific scale for the extra sector  gev , the scale where the higgs quartic crosses zero . ] .",
    "this situation is fundamentally different in models with classical scale invariance in the uv .",
    "if the higgs mass parameter @xmath39 in is zero it will be generated by the vev of the extra scalar through the portal coupling @xmath40 in that case , the ratio of vacuum expectation values is controlled by the portal coupling ( note that @xmath16 has to be negative to trigger a vev for the higgs boson ) @xmath41 and the correction in decouple for @xmath38 . for a vanishing higgs mass parameter @xmath42 and for the higgs being the lightest scalar ,",
    "the vev of the extra scalar is therefore bounded from above .",
    "the requirement that the central value ( @xmath33 upper bound ) of @xmath30 remains positive up to the planck scale implies @xmath43 here , we worked in the limit @xmath27 and neglect the tiny @xmath16 contributions to the running of @xmath30 . in the limit",
    "in which @xmath44 the bounds become @xmath45  tev .",
    "this corresponds to the extreme case of maximal mixing between the higgs and the dark scalar . as we will discuss in section  [ sec : higgs ] , the mixing is strongly constrained by collider bounds .",
    "we now address the question of how to generate the vev for the scalar @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , if not only the higgs mass parameter , but all scales in the potential vanish in the uv , @xmath46 , the vev of the extra scalar can only be induced radiatively , either through strong dynamics , in which a new condensation scale induces a mass term for the extra scalar  @xcite , or by a coleman - weinberg mechanism , in which the balance between the quartic and the one - loop corrections to the effective potential determine the vev  @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the latter mechanism in the following .    in the limit of small higgs portal coupling @xmath47",
    ", we can consider the effective potential @xmath48 for the scalar independently from the higgs boson .",
    "its general one loop form is given by @xmath49 in which the scalar component @xmath50 in is treated as a background field and @xmath3 is the renormalization scale .",
    "subleading terms in @xmath48 that are proportional to the anomalous dimension of @xmath50 are suppressed .",
    "this effective potential has a local minimum if @xmath51 and @xmath52 since @xmath4 is a loop - suppressed function , it follows , that in the vicinity of the minimum , the quartic coupling needs to be small and negative for cw symmetry breaking to work . for the full potential ,",
    "including terms proportional to the portal coupling , @xmath16 , the condition @xmath53 is replaced by  @xcite @xmath54 as long as the portal coupling is small , @xmath55 , this gives approximately the same constraint .",
    "further , the coefficient @xmath4 is related to the beta - function of @xmath35 by the one - loop renormalization group equation @xmath56 in which @xmath57 denotes the one - loop anomalous dimension of the scalar fields @xmath50 and @xmath58 the one - loop beta function of the quartic coupling . from the general form",
    "follows @xmath59 close to the minimum , the first term can be neglected to good approximation .",
    "therefore the beta function of @xmath35 has to be positive to induce a vev for the scalar .",
    "a natural way to ensure a positive beta function in a region around the minimum is to charge the scalar under a dark gauge symmetry .",
    "loops with dark gauge bosons give a positive contribution to @xmath60 and lead to the desired ir instability of the scalar potential . at the same time , a positive beta function for the quartic coupling ensures that the scalar potential is stable in the uv .",
    "independent on whether the vev of the dark scalar is induced by strong dynamics or by a coleman - weinberg mechanism as discussed in the previous section , additional fields with couplings to @xmath13 are required , which can provide dark matter candidates . if the new sector does not introduce explicit mass scales , the masses of any new states can only be generated through the vev of the extra scalar . in this context",
    "it is very interesting that the range suggested by stability considerations seems to agree with the mass scales suggested by the `` wimp miracle '' .",
    "we emphasize that this is a generic feature of extensions of the sm with the above properties .",
    "extended models with additional scalars can of course soften this relation .",
    "examples of models in the literature , in which the electroweak vacuum is stabilized through the higgs portal and dimensionful couplings are absent , reveal the mentioned connection between the dynamical generation of a vacuum expectation value in the ir , the stabilization of the vacuum in the uv , and the dark matter sector : the authors of  @xcite discuss a model with an extra scalar charged under a @xmath61 that gives a majorana mass to right - handed neutrinos through a cw mechanism .",
    "the @xmath62 in this model is not a candidate for dm , because it couples to @xmath63 and the resulting experimental bounds on the @xmath62 push the vev of the extra scalar above 3 tev . as a consequence , the vacuum can not be stabilized up to the planck scale in this model . in @xcite ,",
    "the extra scalar is a doublet under an additional dark @xmath21 and breaks it completely . in this case",
    "the heavy gauge boson triplet constitutes dark matter , and if vacuum stability is enforced , the vev of the scalar is bound to be at the tev scale .",
    "in addition , the authors of @xcite have shown , that the extra gauge couplings that drive the quartic of the extra scalar negative in the ir need to be of order one in these models in order to stabilize the vacuum , so that the masses of the corresponding gauge bosons are bound from below by @xmath64  gev .",
    "if the hidden sector in addition to scalars and gauge bosons has also fermionic degrees of freedom , they are generically required to be lighter than the gauge bosons .",
    "this can easily be understood from the fact that they enter the effective potential with a negative sign , @xmath65\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum goes over fermions ( f ) and bosons ( b ) , @xmath66 denotes the corresponding higgs dependent masses , @xmath67 the number of fermionic / bosonic degrees of freedom , and the @xmath68 are renormalization scheme dependent constants .",
    "if the fermionic contributions dominate the one loop contributions to the effective potential , the condition  ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) can not be fulfilled .",
    "hence , the effective potential is unbounded from below , i.e. the fermions generate a uv instability instead of a ir instability .",
    "therefore , for the cw mechanism to work , the gauge bosons are generically heavier and fermions constitute dark matter . in the following sections we will discuss in detail an example of a model    * that does not contain any explicit mass scales , * that utilizes the coleman - weinberg mechanism in a dark sector to induce spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking through a higgs portal , * that is weakly coupled below the planck scale , with all of the running scalar quartic couplings starting near zero at the planck scale , * that stabilizes the vacuum until the planck scale , and * that contains fermionic dark matter with masses at or below the electroweak scale .",
    "we consider an extension of the sm by a @xmath69 gauge group , under which all sm fields are uncharged .",
    "in addition to the @xmath70 gauge bosons @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we introduce a scalar doublet @xmath13 under @xmath73 with @xmath74 charge @xmath75 .",
    "the fermionic sector consists of two sets of chiral sm singlet fermions : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "the left handed fields @xmath80 and @xmath81 are @xmath73 doublets , while the right handed ones are @xmath73 singlets .",
    "we assign the following dark hypercharges that ensure anomaly cancellation : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "+ we denote the field strength tensors of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 gauge symmetries by @xmath87 and @xmath88 , so that their kinetic terms read @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the index of the adjoint of @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that there is no kinetic mixing between the @xmath74 gauge boson and the sm hypercharge gauge boson .",
    "as our model does not contain fields that are charged under both @xmath20 symmetries , such a choice is stable under radiative corrections . in the absence of kinetic @xmath20 mixing , the only renormalizable portal between the dark sector and the sm is the mixing of the dark scalar with the higgs .",

    "the complementarity of both searches imply excellent prospects to discover or exclude our model in the near future .    finally , we argue , that if the electroweak scale is generated subsequently to the breaking of a dark gauge symmetry , bubble nucleation during the dark and electroweak phase transition becomes a two step process .",
    "previous studies of a similar scenario suggest , that a strong first order phase transition as required by electroweak baryogenesis can be achieved in this setup .",
