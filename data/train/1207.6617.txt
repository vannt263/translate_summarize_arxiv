    "in high voltage transmission networks , lack of wide - area situational awareness has been one of the major causes of large - scale blackouts @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for the lack of situational awareness has been the limitations of the conventional sensors and scada ( supervisory control and data acquisition ) systems .",
    "phasor measurement units ( pmus ) , as compared to conventional sensors , are able to provide gps - synchronized , more accurate and temporally much denser measurements of voltage and current phasors @xcite .",
    "the deployment of pmus for grid sensing is widely considered to be a major driving force for improving the reliability of transmission networks .    there has been considerable research investigating how pmu measurements can be exploited in various tasks for achieving a reliable grid , including outage detection @xcite , state estimation @xcite , stability analysis @xcite , etc .",
    "as the cost of installing and networking pmus is relatively high , two of the major questions are i ) what is the necessary or sufficient number of pmus to use for achieving good performance in all these tasks , and ii ) where are the optimal locations to collect pmu measurements ? for achieving full network observability , it was estimated that about one third of the buses need to provide pmu measurements @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this estimate applies to _ other _ kinds of tasks including outage detection .",
    "moreover , for different tasks , the objectives for which the pmu measurements are used differ considerably , and the corresponding optimal pmu locations can vary greatly .    in this paper , we focus on the problem of using pmu measurements of _ voltage phase angles _ for real time detection of _ line outages _ over wide areas ( including the ones that occur at places where no pmu measurements are available at the control center ) .",
    "we assume that network state estimation during normal conditions is available over relatively slow timescales , ( e.g. , using nerc system data exchange ( sdx ) @xcite ) , which provides the pre - outage base case system parameters and states . in @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", it was demonstrated that many line outages can be detected with only a _ subset _ of the buses providing pmu measurements .",
    "however , a comprehensive understanding of the outage detection performance given arbitrary constraints on the number of pmus to use is left open .",
    "we address this open question of characterizing the optimal trade - off between the number of pmus used and the outage detection performance .",
    "the central problem is finding the _ optimal locations _ at which to collect pmu measurements , which is an np hard combinatorial optimization .",
    "we consider _ both non - adaptive and adaptive _ pmu location selections .",
    "we first define a set of voltage phase angle signatures associated with the potential outages . intuitively , the outage detection performance depends on the degrees of separation among the outage signatures .",
    "we employ the minimum distance among the signatures as an indicator of their degrees of separation .",
    "accordingly , we introduce the max - min distance criterion for optimizing the pmu locations given any constraint on the number of pmus .",
    "a simple greedy heuristic is developed that provides lower bounds on the global optimum .",
    "next , we show that finding the optimal pmu locations can be equivalently formulated as an integer programming problem ( ip ) , which allows a relaxation as a linear program ( lp ) that provides upper bounds on the global optimum .",
    "we then develop a branch and bound algorithm for pmu location selection : at each iteration , we strategically fix a bus to either provide or not provide pmu measurements , and compute new lower and upper bounds using the greedy heuristic and lp relaxation . to understand the optimal trade - off between the number of pmus and the minimum distance among the outage signatures , we apply the proposed branch and bound algorithm on detecting all single line outages in ieee 14 , 24 and 30 bus systems @xcite , and show that the globally optimal pmu locations can be found in a small number of iterations .",
    "the optimal trade - offs show that having roughly _ one third _ of the buses to provide pmu measurements is sufficient for achieving the same outage detection performance as with all the buses providing pmu measurements .",
    "we consider a power transmission network with @xmath0 buses and @xmath1 transmission lines .",
    "we denote the set of all the buses by @xmath2 , and the set of all the lines by @xmath3 .",
    "we study the problem of _ line outage detection _ , where an outage event corresponds to the loss of a subset of lines in @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , there are in total @xmath5 different possible outage events , which correspond to all the non - empty subsets of @xmath4 . in practice",
    ", however , there are several reasons for us to consider a much smaller subset of the outage events :    * in case a single line outage results in the overloading and overheating of another line , it often takes minutes after the initial single line outage for the overheated line to trip .",
    "thus , within a few tens of seconds , it is very unlikely to see many line outages happen together due to their probabilistic independence . *",
    "not all the outage events have the same level of impact on the grid . for example",
    ", some line outages do not lead to the overheating of other lines , while others do .",
    "the latter have a greater impact on the grid as they may cause cascading failures . * as we would like to detect and locate outages in real time with good detection performance , the limitations of computational power may forbid us to consider too many outage events .    based on the above considerations and the real world situation , a set of _ outage events of interest _ shall be selected , which we denote by @xmath6 . for example , in @xcite , @xmath7 contains all single and double line outages , respectively .",
    "given an outage event set @xmath7 , we augment it by the _ non - outage event _",
    "( i.e. , normal condition ) @xmath8 , and denote the augmented set by @xmath9 .",
    "we investigate the following problem :    * the grid starts in normal condition @xmath8 . *",
    "either the grid stays in normal condition @xmath10 , or an arbitrary outage event @xmath11 occurs . *",
    "we make a detection decision @xmath12 .",
    "the detection is successful if @xmath13 , otherwise not .",
    "is an example of single line outage . ]",
    "we detect outages by observing the _ voltage phase angles at a subset of the buses _ , where the phasor measurements are provided by pmus . a system diagram for this problem",
    "is depicted in figure [ sysdiag ] . as outages",
    "shall be detected as quickly as possible to prevent cascading effects , we aim at detecting an outage within about ten seconds after its occurrence .",
    "we note that the phase angles typically stabilize within a few seconds after a line outage occurs @xcite , and we assume that the power injections of the network remain the same within these few seconds .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption as power injections change relatively slowly .",
    "we make use of the stabilized phase angles before and after an outage to make detection decisions .      for each event @xmath14",
    ", we denote the corresponding stabilized phase angles at all the buses by @xmath15 .",
    "we employ the dc power flow model to compute @xmath16 as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the power injections , and @xmath19 is determined by the line status information after event @xmath20 occurs @xcite .",
    "we note the following properties of @xmath21 :    *   @xmath22 + and we can arbitrarily add the same constant phase angle to every entry of @xmath23 , without having any change of @xmath24 . *",
    "@xmath25 if and only if the grid is connected . in the case where the grid contains islands , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of connected components ( islands ) of the grid .",
    "we note that if an outage creates islands in the grid , the balance of the power injections may not be satisfied by the same @xmath24 , and may not hold anymore .",
    "for example , in figure [ sysdiag ] , the loss of line @xmath28 will create a single bus island @xmath29 which may not be self - balanced ( i.e. , the pre - outage power injection at @xmath29 may not be zero ) .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the cases where the post - outage grid remains connected , and leave the islanding cases as future work .    in practice ,",
    "_ noisy _ versions of the pre - outage and post - outage phase angle vectors are observed : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the actual outage ( or non - outage if @xmath32 ) that occurred , and @xmath33 are observation noise vectors that account for the errors in the measurement data and the system parameter data . in the following sections ,",
    "we assume that the noises at all the buses are i.i.d .. we will generalize this assumption in section [ gennoise ] .",
    "the task of line outage detection can then be formulated as the following hypothesis testing problem :    _ from observing the pre - outage and post - outage phase angle vectors @xmath34 , identify which event @xmath35 has occurred_.    for this hypothesis testing problem , @xmath36 can be viewed as the _ signatures _ of the events @xmath37 . to identify any event @xmath35 , all the signatures @xmath38",
    "shall be collected before an outage occurs .    from",
    ", we pre - compute the signatures by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pseudoinverse of @xmath41 .",
    "we assume that the knowledge of the power injections @xmath24 and the normal condition @xmath42 matrix are available from system - wide data sources ( e.g. , the nerc sdx @xcite , or other state estimation mechanisms that operate over relatively slow timescales , cf .",
    "figure [ sysdiag ] . )",
    "note that , with the knowledge of the open line indices for event @xmath20 , the post - outage @xmath41 matrices @xmath43 can be derived from the normal condition @xmath42 matrix . as a result , while the grid is working under normal conditions , the signatures @xmath38 can be pre - computed by in preparation for detecting the potential line outages in @xmath7 . intuitively , _",
    "the more separated the signatures are from each other , the better detection performance can be achieved . _ in later sections , we characterize the separation by the minimum distance among the signature set .    from",
    ", a phase angle vector @xmath23 remains functionally equivalent by adding the same constant to all its entries . without loss of generality ( wlog ) , we can choose any one of the @xmath0 buses as the _ reference bus _ , and subtract the phase angle at the reference bus from the phase angles at all the @xmath0 buses , such that the phase angle at the reference bus is always kept at zero . in principle",
    ", it does not matter which bus among the @xmath0 buses is chosen to be the reference bus .",
    "however , it does matter in the case when only a _ subset _ of the buses phase angles are available .",
    "this is because once we choose a bus as the reference bus , we implicitly assume that the phase angle at this bus is available .",
    "we now establish the main problem of this paper , namely , pmu location selection . in , synchronous and timely updates of the complete phase angle",
    "vector require _ all _ the buses to have pmu measurements , and moreover low latency communication links that convey the pmu measurements from all the buses to the control center that performs timely outage detection .    in practice , however , it may not be economically desirable that every bus has a pmu and constantly communicates the pmu measurements to the control center , _ particularly when there is very little performance loss with only a fraction of the buses providing pmu measurements_. we motivate the selection of a _ subset _ of the buses to provide pmu measurements in the following two application scenarios :    1 .",
    "as the cost of pmu installation in high voltage transmission networks is relatively high , we may want to install pmus only at a subset of the buses to reduce cost .",
    "2 .   suppose over time the cost of pmus drops and all ( or many ) buses have pmus installed .",
    "due to the _ information redundancy _ in the pmu measurements , it may not be effective to communicate the data from all the buses to the control center , consuming an unnecessary amount of the expensive low - latency communication link capacity , and also incurring a longer data collection delay .",
    "thus , the control center may select only a subset of the pmus to provide measurements .    in the following sections , we address the second application scenario , in which the pmu location selection can adapt to the changes of the power injections @xmath24 and the network @xmath44 matrix over time .",
    "we show later in section [ discgen ] that the results can be directly extended to the first application scenario where a non - adaptive pmu location selection is required .",
    "the problem of pmu location selection entails the following two questions :    as mentioned in the last section , it makes no sense to have a bus chosen as the reference bus without having a pmu measuring its phase angle .",
    "therefore , to find the optimal pmu locations , we can not simply choose a reference bus arbitrarily , as it does lose generality .",
    "instead , we _ traverse all the @xmath0 cases of choosing each bus as the reference bus . _    from now on , we assume that _ we have chosen a reference bus @xmath45 during this outer traversal , and optimize the location selection of the other @xmath46 pmus . _",
    "we assume that all the phase angle vectors have been adjusted so that their @xmath47 entries always equal @xmath48 : @xmath49 accordingly , we denote by @xmath50 the subset of buses with pmu measurements in addition to @xmath45 , @xmath51 . as a result , for any two phase angle vectors , we can not distinguish their entries at the other @xmath52 buses in @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , for any phase angle vector @xmath23 , we project it into a sub - vector by extracting the @xmath46 entries of @xmath23 whose indices are in @xmath50 ( it is not necessarily an orthogonal projection ) and denote the projected vector by @xmath54 .",
    "accordingly , every set @xmath50 leads to a set of projected signatures @xmath55 .    clearly , with different choices of @xmath50 , the _ degrees of separation _ among the projected signatures can differ considerably .",
    "intuitively we want to optimize @xmath50 to get better separation among the projected signatures , and thus better detection performance .",
    "we model the separation among the projected signatures ( and hence the outage detection performance ) by the _ minimum distance _ in @xmath56-norm among them : @xmath57 where @xmath56 is a parameter to choose , and @xmath58 corresponds to the euclidian distance .",
    "given @xmath59 as the total number of pmus to use , @xmath50 can then be optimized under the following _ max - min distance criterion _ : @xmath60 clearly , is an np hard combinatorial optimization of the set @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath61 can be re - written as @xmath62 where    *   + @xmath63 * @xmath64 , and its columns are constructed by collecting the following @xmath65 @xmath66 vectors : + @xmath67 @xmath68    where the @xmath69 operation is applied _",
    "elementwise_.    in other words , the indices of the non - zero entries of @xmath70 denote the @xmath59 buses that are chosen to provide pmu measurements ( including the reference bus @xmath45 ) .",
    "we name the binary vector @xmath70 the _ bus selection indicator vector_. consequently , is equivalent to the following integer programming problem : @xmath71 clearly , finding the global optimum of requires a worst - case computational complexity of @xmath72 .",
    "in this section , we provide two algorithms for solving the combinatorial optimization of pmu location selection .      we develop a greedy heuristic that generates a series of pmu location selection solutions @xmath73 for @xmath74 respectively , that satisfy the following _ consistency property _ : @xmath75 we present the greedy algorithm as follows in a slightly more general form with an arbitrary initial set of selected buses @xmath76 :    @ l @ l @ p8.4 cm @ +   +   +   +   +   + & & @xmath77 , +   + & & @xmath78 +   +   +   +    in other words , given the total number of pmus @xmath59 and a starting set of chosen buses @xmath76 , we choose another @xmath79 buses _ one by one _ : at each step , we keep the already chosen buses ; from the remaining buses , we choose the one that _ maximizes the current step s minimum distance _ , and include it in the set of the chosen buses . when the only prior knowledge of the bus selection is the chosen reference bus @xmath45 , @xmath80 , and algorithm 1 generates the set of greedy consistent solutions as @xmath59 increases from @xmath81 to @xmath0 .",
    "first , we note that the integer programming formulation has a concave objective function , and hence has the following _ relaxation _ as a convex optimization : @xmath82 in fact , this convex optimization can be equivalently cast as a linear program @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the optimal value of serves as an _ upper bound _ , denoted by @xmath83 , on the global optimum of . meanwhile , algorithm 1 with @xmath80 provides a _ lower bound _ , denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "another lower bounding heuristic is to find an integral solution by _ rounding _ the fractional solution obtained from the relaxed problem .",
    "in particular , we consider the heuristic by rounding _",
    "the @xmath59 largest _ fractional entries to @xmath85 , and the others to @xmath48 . in all scenarios that we simulated",
    ", we compared this rounding heuristic with the greedy heuristic : somewhat to our surprise , _ the greedy heuristic uniformly outperforms the rounding heuristic_. the reason is that , in the relaxed fractional solution , it is often some _ very small _ non - zero entries that are _ critical _ in the sense that losing them will drastically reduce the minimum distance .",
    "consequently , for lower bounding the global optimum , we propose the greedy heuristic instead of the rounding heuristic , as the former is both much cheaper computationally and much better in performance .",
    "thus , we use the relaxation technique _ not _ to provide a fractional solution to round , but to _ upper bound _ the global optimum and to develop a _ branch and bound _",
    "algorithm that can significantly improve the greedy solutions in a few iterations .",
    "for any bus @xmath86 , can be split into two sub - problems by fixing @xmath87 to be either @xmath48 or @xmath85 : @xmath88 and @xmath89 similarly to , relaxations of these two sub - problems can be formed by replacing and with , and they provide upper bounds , denoted by @xmath90 and @xmath91 , on the global optimum of and respectively . meanwhile , applying the greedy heuristic under the constraint @xmath92 or @xmath93 provides lower bounds , denoted by @xmath94 and @xmath95 , on these sub - problems global optima .",
    "define @xmath96 then , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are new upper and lower bounds on the original global optimum @xcite .",
    "more generally , the above splitting procedure with relaxations and greedy heuristics can be applied on the sub - problems themselves to form more children sub - problems with upper and lower bounds .",
    "for example , for any bus @xmath99 can be further split into two sub - problems by adding yet another constraint @xmath100 or @xmath101 respectively .",
    "we define the following upper and lower bounding oracles , as well as an oracle that returns the next bus to split :    oracle @xmath102 takes a _ constraint set _ @xmath103 as input , where @xmath103 specifies a set of buses whose selection indicator variables are pre - determined to be either @xmath48 or @xmath85 .",
    "an ip under the constraints @xmath103 is formed , a relaxation is solved , and the optimum of this relaxation is output by @xmath102 as an upper bound on the optimum of the constrained ip .",
    "for example , in and , the constraint sets are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "oracle @xmath106 takes a constraint set @xmath103 as input .",
    "an ip under the constraints @xmath103 is formed , a greedy solution is found by algorithm 1 , and the achieved objective value is output by @xmath106 as a lower bound on the optimum of the constrained ip .    based on the _ order _ of the buses chosen by algorithm 1 , oracle @xmath107 outputs _ the first _ bus that is chosen by this heuristic .",
    "when a sub - problem with constraints @xmath103 needs to be split further , @xmath107 is the bus we choose to perform the splitting by fixing @xmath108 to be either @xmath48 or @xmath85 .",
    "we now provide a branch and bound algorithm as in algorithm 2 where @xmath109 is the maximum number of iterations allowed . as the algorithm progresses , _",
    "a binary tree is developed where each node represents a constraint set_. the _ leaf nodes _ are kept in @xmath110 .",
    "the tree starts with a single node , @xmath111 , corresponding to the prior knowledge that the reference bus is @xmath45 who uses a pmu .",
    "when a sub - problem corresponding to a leaf node @xmath112 is split into two new sub - problems , the two new constraint sets @xmath113 and @xmath114 become the children of the parent constraint set @xmath112 . in algorithm 2 , is a generalization of .",
    "it means that the current global upper bound equals the _ highest _ upper bound among all the _ leaf node _ constraint sets .",
    "this is true because all the leaf nodes @xmath110 represent a _ complete partition _ of the original parameter space @xcite . at the beginning of every iteration , in choosing which leaf node to split , we select the one that gives the _ highest _ upper bound ( i.e. , the current _ global _ upper bound ) .",
    "it is a heuristic based on the reasoning that , by further splitting this critical leaf node , a lower global upper bound may be obtained , ( whereas splitting any other node will leave the global upper bound unchanged . ) at iteration @xmath115 , the current upper and lower bounds on the global optimum are available as @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "bus @xmath150 are chosen to provide pmu measurements , achieving the same minimum distance among the outage signatures as with all the 30 buses chosen .",
    "as shown in table 3 , since @xmath151 for @xmath152 , this globally optimal solution can in fact be found by the simple greedy method of algorithm 1 .    .",
    "the buses enclosed by rectangles are the optimally chosen buses . ]",
    "the max - min distance criterion we have used is for countering the effect of the noise by separating the outage signatures as much as possible . in general",
    ", the variances of the noise in the pmu measurements _ may differ at different buses_. this shall be taken into account when defining the _ effective distances _ among the outage signatures .    for two outage signatures @xmath153 and @xmath154 , denote their difference in absolute value by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is applied elementwise .",
    "the @xmath157 entry @xmath158 is the distance between the two signatures _ at the @xmath157 bus_.    suppose now that the noises are independently gaussian with variances @xmath159 at the @xmath0 buses .",
    "we can then _ normalize _ the distance at the @xmath157 bus by a factor of @xmath160 : @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "after this normalization , it is now appropriate to _ add up _ all the buses contributions in separating the signatures by computing the @xmath56-norm of @xmath163 : @xmath164    accordingly , the definition of the minimum distance among the signatures is generalized as follows : @xmath165    for the ip formulation , it was assumed that @xmath166 for some @xmath167 in the previous definition of @xmath168 . with an arbitrary @xmath169 , the matrix of the distances among the outage signatures is then generalized by the following normalization : @xmath170      we have provided two application scenarios in section [ pmuloc ] that motivate the problem of pmu location selection . in the previous sections",
    ", we have focused on the second scenario in which the outage signatures @xmath171 , and hence the optimal pmu location selection , depend on the current network setting @xmath24 and @xmath44 .    in the first scenario , however , location selection for _ pmu installation _ is a planning problem whose solution must work _ non - adaptively _ in the sense that the installed pmus are not transferable to other locations . as a result",
    ", the pmu locations must be chosen to accommodate , if not all , _ the most typical _ network settings in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath44 .",
    "as we consider wide - area transmission networks , this requirement is addressed as follows :    * the network topology @xmath44 is in general slowly and slightly changing , and an approximate estimate of it would suffice for computing typical sets of outage signatures .",
    "* typical power injections @xmath24 are available from grid statistics for high voltage transmission networks : collecting the typical data for _ different seasons _ and during _ daytime and nighttime _ would suffice for computing typical sets of outage signatures .    with a set of typical power injections @xmath172 , and an estimated @xmath44 , there are @xmath173 typical sets of outage signatures : @xmath174 the minimum distance can be generalized as @xmath175 similarly to , we construct @xmath176 , and its columns are constructed by collecting the following @xmath177 @xmath66 vectors : @xmath178 @xmath179 where the @xmath69 operation is applied _",
    "elementwise_.    the problem of non - adaptive pmu location selection with can then be formulated as the same integer programming problem , for which algorithm 1 and 2 can be applied .",
    "we have studied the problem of pmu location selection for detecting line outages in wide - area transmission networks .",
    "we have first introduced the voltage phase angle signatures of the outages .",
    "we have then established the pmu location selection problem as maximizing the minimum distance among the set of outage signatures , and have shown that it can be equivalently formulated as an integer programming problem . for this np hard problem ,",
    "we have developed a greedy heuristic and a linear programming relaxation , providing a lower and an upper bound on the global optimum respectively .",
    "based on this heuristic and relaxation , we have proposed a branch and bound algorithm to find the globally optimal pmu locations . using this algorithm ,",
    "we have characterized the optimal trade - offs between the number of pmus and the minimum distance among the outage signatures in ieee 14 , 24 and 30 bus systems .",
    "for all the simulated cases , the optimal pmu locations are found in at most @xmath143 ( and in most cases a much less number of ) iterations . from the optimal trade - offs , we have observed that it is sufficient to have roughly one third of the buses to provide pmu measurements in order to achieve the same outage detection performance as with all the buses providing pmu measurements .    for future work , while we have employed the max - min distance criterion among the outage signatures , it is interesting to investigate the use of other criteria in characterizing outage detection performance .",
    "we would also like to examine the optimal pmu location selections with outage event sets more general than line outages .",
