    "we shall show that there are ( precisely ) three independent permutation symmetric functions / variables of the relative coordinates , that are related to simple geometrical / physical properties ( the moment of inertia , the area , and the perimeter of the triangle ) which clearly distinguishes them , and that the potential s dependence on any one of them in particular carries dynamical consequences .",

    "this form of the y - string potential , when expressed in terms of triangle sides @xmath21 only , exhibits its permutation symmetry @xmath3 , but hides the hidden / implicit angular dependence of the potential , and potential interdependencies on other permutation symmetric variables : the triangle area can be written using heron s formula @xmath22 as a function of the triangle s semi - perimeter @xmath23 and the three sides @xmath24",
    ".    it should be intuitively clear , however , that the perimeter and the area of the triangle are two independent properties of the triangle .",

    "one special case of such a permutation is the @xmath69 transposition , which is a reflection that reverses the sign of @xmath70 , which is equivalent to the already mentioned ( geometrical ) mirror symmetry .",

    "the non - linear relationship reads @xmath79 , \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the third permutation symmetric variable may be taken as @xmath80 .",
    "any ( reasonable ) confining three - body potential must be permutation symmetric , so it must be a function of ( only ) @xmath81 and @xmath82 . as all three of these variables have non - zero dimensions , one might think that each one represents a potentially new definition of the  interquark distance \" ; that is not the case , as can be seen when one changes to hyper - spherical coordinates .",
    "the three permutation - symmetric hyper - spherical variables are @xmath47 and @xmath83    when the interaction potential does not depend functionally on all three permutation symmetric variables , then additional dynamical symmetries appear : e.g. the  central \" part of the string potential eq .",

    "that leads to a new integral of motion @xmath87 , associated with the dynamical symmetry ( lie ) group @xmath88 , see sect .",
    "below , which is not conserved in the case of the @xmath0 string potential .",
    "further , when the potential depends only on @xmath47 , the dynamical symmetry is extended to the @xmath89 lie group .",
    "the @xmath0-string potential @xmath90 can be expressed in terms of @xmath91 : just solve eqs .",
    "( [ e : v]),([e : a ] ) for @xmath4 as functions of @xmath91 and insert the results @xmath92 i.e. @xmath93 into eq .",
    "( [ e : hypvy2 ] ) which shows that @xmath94 is a function of all three permutation symmetric three - body variables , however .",
    "so , we see that in general the two string potentials depend on different symmetric three - body variables , and thus can not be smoothly connected , except perhaps in special cases / geometries , where the variable @xmath82 , and/or other variable(s ) vanish .      thus , we need to solve @xmath95 there are two  trivial \" solutions : 1 ) @xmath50 ; 2 ) @xmath96 ; and a family of non - trivial solutions to 3 ) @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath98 , which determines the admissible  smooth crossover \" region ( the blue long - dashed curve ) in fig . [",
    "f : bound1 ] .",
    "thus , we can see that out of the double - continuum (  plane \" ) of possible geometric configurations at a given  interquark distance \" @xmath47 , a  smooth crossover \" is potentially admissible , though not guaranteed , only on a single continuum ( the blue dashed curves and the vertical axis at @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ f : bound1 ] ) .",
    "now , to make this an actual  smooth crossover \" region , rather than merely an admissible one , one must find the intersection of this curve and the locus of zeros of @xmath100 , that we searched for in sect . [",
    "s : diff1 ] , to no avail .",
    "this fact , together with our numerical results from sect .",
    "[ s : diff1 ] , are sufficient proof of our claim that even along this curve the crossover is _ never _ smooth .",
    "this means that , in order to provide a continuous transition from the @xmath0 to the y - string configuration at any finite-@xmath47 crossover point , including the @xmath101 one , the string tension @xmath102 must be variable and have a discontinuity in at least one ( permutation symmetric ) variable .",
    "all - in - all , this shows that with constant string tension @xmath103 there can be no smooth transition from the @xmath0 to the y - string configuration in any geometry . even when @xmath104 there are only three geometric configurations where a smooth transition can be accomplished , see the discussion below and fig .",
    "[ f : bound2 ] .",

    "the new integral of motion @xmath107 can be integrated and the resulting holonomic constraint can be used to eliminate one degree of freedom @xcite . in the case of the @xmath0 string potential",
    "this @xmath107 is not an integral - of - motion , i.e. it is not constant in time , however , due to the absence of the o(2 ) symmetry of this potential @xcite .",

    "( [ e : o2 trf ] ) can be applied to the coordinates @xmath46 as follows : @xmath108 note that these equations are non - linear in @xmath60 implying a non - trivial transformation of the  shape space \" under this new dynamical o(2 ) symmetry .",
    "only near the origin @xmath109 does this transformation look like an infinitesimal rotation ; at the edges @xmath110 it either vanishes , or diverges .",
    "one can find another set of scalar variables @xmath111 in which the dynamical o(2 ) symmetry transformation rules eqs .",

    "a detailed study of this symmetry is a task for the future @xcite .",
    "one possible way to fit the lattice results is , perhaps , to have a ",
    "composite y - string \" that contains a  core triangle \" of variable size ( proportional to , yet smaller than the quark triangle ) instead of the y - junction point , see fig . [",
    "f : new y_3q ] . in that case , however , one may not talk about a definite cross - over inter - quark distance / hyper - radius , and one would still have contributions from both kinds of string at all distances .",
    "note , however , that this prescription is precisely equivalent to the sum of two strings with unequal tensions : for a given ( fixed ) value of parameter @xmath112 ( coefficient of proportionality ) one has @xmath113 there is at least one good reason for the unequal string tensions , _ viz . _ the different color factors associated with the quadratic and the cubic casimir operators of su(3 ) , c.f .",
    "it appears  natural \" to associate the cubic casimir color factor with the y - string and the quadratic casimir color factor with the @xmath0 string . as there is no ( reliable ) way of dealing with color non - singlets on the lattice ( see , however the work of saito et al .",
    "@xcite ) heretofore there was little hope of extracting these factors ( or at least their ratio ) from the lattice .",
    "this ansatz allows , at least in principle , the extraction of the ratio of the y - string and the @xmath0-string tensions @xmath114 .",
    "note that in this case the smooth crossover from the @xmath0 to the y - string is not entirely out of the question , albeit it is still severely restricted in the shape space .",
    "the intersection of the curve defined by eq .",
    "( [ e : va ] ) and the locus of zeros of @xmath100 , figs .",
    "[ f : diff3 ] , [ f : diff4 ] , yields the allowed crossover points / configurations , of which there are at most six ( out of a double - continuum , see fig . [",

    "one obtains a region of admissible values of @xmath116 from the admissible values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
