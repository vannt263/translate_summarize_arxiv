    "recent experimental data from the lhc @xcite-@xcite suggests that a higgs like particle with a mass of 125 - 126 gev has been found .",
    "although this particle is consistent with a standard model higgs boson it would be interesting to explore the consequences of this discovery for various extensions of the standard model . among these one of",
    "the most natural is the two higgs doublet model .",
    "many authors @xcite-@xcite have studied the parameter space of this type of model for the three possible scenarios : the 125 gev higgs boson is the lightest scalar in the model , the heaviest or the pseudoscalar @xmath1 .    in the present work",
    "we analyze a particular case of the two higgs doublet models introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will study the quadratic divergences of the scalars involved and in connection to the latest experimental data .",
    "more exactly we suggest that a criterion of naturalness should be applied also to this class of models .",
    "we start with a two higgs doublet model discussed in @xcite with a tree level effective higgs potential that satisfies the requirement of @xmath2 flavor invariance together with parity and charge conjugation invariances .",
    "we denote the two higgs doublets by @xmath3 and @xmath4 where , @xmath5 , \\hspace{1 cm } \\psi= \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } -ia^+\\\\ \\frac{\\eta+ia_0}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\end{array } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{doubl54}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can make three invariants : @xmath6    then the tree level potential can be written as : @xmath7    since we consider the doublet @xmath4 to have reversed parity with respect to @xmath3 the potential does not contain a term linear in @xmath8 due to parity invariance .    for a reasonable range of parameters",
    "the potential admits a minimum with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "( see@xcite for details .",
    "note that we also slightly change the notation for the @xmath11 to agree with the standard model two higgs doublets ) .",
    "the minimum condition reads : @xmath12    whereas the scalar masses are simply : @xmath13    from the higgs mass and the minimum condition one can determine the two parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the masses of the other scalars depend on the three unknown parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . assuming that the lightest higgs coincides with the scalar discovered by atlas and cms with a mass @xmath19 gev , except for some lower bounds we have little experimental information regarding @xmath20 and the @xmath21 s .    in the present model",
    "one can add two lower limits stemming from the well known experimental knowledge on the z width , @xmath22    since the decays of z to @xmath23 and to @xmath24 are kinematically prohibited .",
    "we adopt the criterion of the cancellation of the quadratic divergences , the analogue of the veltman condition @xcite for the standard model .",
    "thus we will ask that the masses and couplings are such that the quadratic divergences to all scalar masses in our model cancel .",
    "the corresponding set of conditions was derived by newton and wu @xcite for the most general two higgs doublet model . applied to our case this leads to two constraints .",
    "these are : @xmath25    from these it is straightforward to determine : @xmath26    the latest experimental data suggest @xcite-@xcite that the actual mass of the higgs boson is around 125 - 126 gev .",
    "thus the constraint in eq ( [ res5454 ] ) would lead to @xmath27 which is unacceptable from the point of view of the vacuum structure .",
    "a possible interesting way out is to generalize our simple two higgs doublet so as to admit a vev different from zero also for the @xmath20 . for",
    "that we assume that the model is still parity and charge conjugation invariant but that the vacuum spontaneously breaks the parity invariance .",
    "in the situation when @xmath28 , @xmath29 the minimum equations for the potential become :    @xmath30    if we denote , @xmath31    then the mass eigenstates are obtained through the transformation : @xmath32 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos{\\alpha}&\\sin{\\alpha}\\\\ -\\sin{\\alpha}&\\cos{\\alpha } \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } h\\\\ h \\end{array } \\right ] , \\label{def543354}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath33    we define as usual @xmath34 where @xmath35 . then the mass spectrum can be easily derived and we deduce , @xmath36 \\nonumber\\\\ & & m_{h}^2 m_{h}^2=v^4[4\\alpha_3 \\alpha_4-(\\alpha_5+\\alpha_6)^2]\\sin^2(\\beta)\\cos^2(\\beta ) .",
    "\\label{eq3232}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and ,    @xmath37    since we still preserve the parity invariance at the level of the lagrangian the fermion couple only to first higgs doublet ( type i higgs doublet model ) . for this case",
    "the newton - wu conditions @xcite , @xcite of cancellation of quadratic divergences read ( we keep only the top and bottom quarks ) : @xmath38    the couplings of the higgs with the top and bottom quarks in our model are : @xmath39    whereas the coupling of the higgs with the gauge bosons w and z read : @xmath40    from these one can compute the two photon decay rate of the higgs boson @xcite : @xmath41    here the value of @xmath42 gev was used and 8.35 and -1.84 are the w and top loop contributions in the standard model .",
    "the model contains seven parameters .",
    "two of them can be eliminated from the minimum equations .",

    "there are solutions only for @xmath53 gev .",

    "there are two reasonable sets of solutions for @xmath47 ( see fig.1 ) both for masses of the a s @xmath56 gev .",
    "however only the second set of solutions ( dashed line in fig.1 ) give acceptable two diphoton decay rate for the higgs boson as illustrated in fig.2 and also correct couplings with the bottom quarks ( see fig.7 thick line ) .",

    "the three scenarios displayed in table i @xcite correspond to : 1 ) the mass of the lightest higgs boson is 125 - 126 gev ; 2 ) the mass of the heaviest higgs boson is 125 - 126 gev ; 3 ) there are two resonances , h and @xmath1 with a mass around 125 - 126 gev .",

    "the naturalness criterion plays an important role in building beyond the standard model theories like supersymmetry , technicolor , extra dimensions , little higgs etc .",
    "even if the two higgs doublet model can be viewed as a lower effective limit of one of these theories or another one should still consider a measure of the fine - tuning that it is allowed at least with respect to some scale at which new physics might intervene .    in the present work we consider for a particular type i two higgs doublet model two cases : a ) when the scale of new physics is high and b ) when the scale of new physics is relatively low .",

    "we thus estimate an acceptable interval for the masses of the other neutral and charged higgs bosons : h , @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "depending on the set of conditions applied the range of masses can be larger or smaller .",
    "our conclusion is that our two higgs doublet model can both be natural and in agreement with the latest experimental data .",
