    "hadronic decays of the @xmath1 lepton provide an excellent playground for the study of qcd at low energies .",
    "its mass of @xmath2 is in an energy region where perturbation theory is still applicable , but also non - perturbative effects come into play and need to be included .",
    "these may arise from vacuum - condensate terms in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) and from so - called _ duality - violating _ contributions close to the physical , minkowskian energy axis .    in the seminal article @xcite , the strategy for a precise determination of the qcd coupling @xmath0 from the total @xmath1 hadronic width @xmath3 } { \\gamma[\\tau^- \\to e^- \\overline \\nu_e \\nu_\\tau ( \\gamma ) ] } \\,=\\ , 3.640(10 ) \\,,\\ ] ]",
    "was developed , while in the subsequent years moments of spectral @xmath1-decay distributions were incorporated into the analyses as well @xcite .",
    "the analytical computation of the perturbative order @xmath4 correction @xcite has recently revived the interest in @xmath5 analyses from hadronic @xmath1 decays which after evolution to the @xmath6 boson mass scale resulted in the following determinations : @xmath7 the dispersion in these results dominantly originates from different treatments of the renormalisation group ( rg ) resummation of the perturbative series , namely fixed - order perturbation theory ( fopt ) , or contour - improved perturbation theory ( cipt ) @xcite , being systematically larger than the last included term in the expansion , which often in asymptotic series provides an estimate of the uncertainty due to higher - order terms not included in the partial sum .",
    "this points to the necessity of investigating the influence of different rg resummations in more detail , which can for example be performed within exactly resummable models for the perturbative series .",
    "most suitable for the @xmath0 determination is the @xmath1 decay rate into light @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks @xmath10 via a vector or axialvector current , since in this case power corrections are especially suppressed .",
    "theoretically , @xmath10 takes the form @xcite @xmath11\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite are electroweak corrections , @xmath14 comprises the perturbative qcd correction , and the @xmath15 denote quark mass and higher @xmath16-dimensional operator corrections which arise in the framework of the ope .",
    "below , only the purely perturbative correction @xmath14 shall be considered , which gives the dominant contribution to @xmath10 . in fopt",
    "it takes the general form @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the coefficients which appear in the perturbative expansion of the vector correlation function , @xmath20 at each perturbative order , the coefficients @xmath21 can be considered independent , while all other @xmath19 with @xmath22 are calculable from the rg equation .",
    "further details can for example be found in ref .",
    "finally , the @xmath23 are contour integrals in the complex @xmath24-plane , which are defined by @xmath25 the first three , being required up to @xmath26 , take the numerical values @xmath27    at order @xmath28 fopt contains unsummed logarithms of order @xmath29 with @xmath30 related to the contour integrals @xmath23 .",
    "cipt sums these logarithms , which yields @xmath31 in terms of the contour integrals @xmath32 over the running coupling , defined as : @xmath33 in contrast to fopt , for cipt each order @xmath34 just depends on the corresponding coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "thus , all contributions proportional to the coefficient @xmath21 which in fopt appear at all perturbative orders equal or greater than @xmath34 are resummed into a single term .",
    "numerically , the two approaches lead to significant differences . employing the recent average @xmath35 @xcite , leading to @xmath36 , in eqs .",
    "( [ del0fo ] ) and ( [ del0ci ] ) , one finds @xmath37 where the first number in both cases employs the known coefficients up to @xmath38 @xcite and the numbers in brackets include an estimate of the @xmath39 term with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "inspecting the individual contributions from each order , up to @xmath39 the cipt series appears to be better convergent .",
    "however , around the seventh order , the contour integrals @xmath32 change sign and thus at this order the contributions are bound to become small .",
    "therefore , the faster approach to the minimal term does not necessarily imply that cipt gives the closer approach to the true result for the resummed series .",
    "to investigate whether fopt or cipt results in a better approximation to @xmath14 , one requires a physically motivated model for its series .",
    "such a model was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is based on the borel transform of the adler function @xmath41 : @xmath42 \\,.\\ ] ] in the following discussion it is slightly more convenient to utilise the related function @xmath43 .",
    "its borel transform @xmath44(t)$ ] is defined by the relation @xmath45(t)\\,.\\ ] ] the integral @xmath46 , if it exists , gives the borel sum of the original divergent series .",
    "it was found that the borel - transformed adler function @xmath44(t)$ ] obtains infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalon poles at positive and negative integer values of the variable @xmath47 , respectively @xcite .",
    "( with the exception of @xmath48 . )",
    "apart from very low orders , where a dominance of renormalon poles close to @xmath49 has not yet set in , intermediate orders should be dominated by the leading ir renormalon poles , while the leading uv renormalon , being closest to @xmath49 , dictates the large - order behaviour of the perturbative expansion .",
    "assuming that only the first two orders are not yet dominated by the lowest ir renormalons , one is led to the ansatz @xmath50(u ) & \\!\\!=\\!\\ ! & b[{\\widehat}d_1^{\\rm uv}](u ) + b[{\\widehat}d_2^{\\rm ir}](u ) + { \\nonumber}\\\\ { \\vbox{\\vskip 4 mm } } & & b[{\\widehat}d_3^{\\rm ir}](u ) + d_0^{\\rm po } + d_1^{\\rm po } u \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which includes one uv renormalon at @xmath51 , the two leading ir renormalons at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as well as polynomial terms for the two lowest perturbative orders .",
    "explicit expressions for the uv and ir renormalon pole terms @xmath54(u)$ ] and @xmath55(u)$ ] can be found in section  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "apart from the residues @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the full structure of the renormalon pole terms is dictated by the ope and the rg .",
    "therefore , the model  ( [ bru ] ) depends on five parameters , the three residua @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , as well as the two polynomial parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these parameters can be fixed by matching to the perturbative expansion of @xmath43 up to @xmath39 .",
    "thereby , also the estimate for @xmath63 is used .",
    "the parameters of the model ( [ bru ] ) are then found to be : @xmath64\\ ] ] @xmath65 the fact that the parameter @xmath62 turns out to be small implies that the coefficient @xmath66 is already reasonably well described by the renormalon pole contribution , although it was not used to fix the residua .",
    "therefore , one could set @xmath67 and actually work with a model which only has four parameters .",
    "the predicted value @xmath68 then turns out very close to the estimate , which can be viewed as one test of the stability of the model .",
    ".relative contributions ( in % ) of the different ir and uv renormalon poles to the adler - function coefficients @xmath66 to @xmath69 for the borel model ( [ bru]).[tab1 ] [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    as the behaviour of cipt versus fopt hinges on the contribution of the leading ir renormalon at @xmath52 , in principal also models can be constructed for which cipt provides a better account of the borel sum .",
    "these would generally be models where @xmath59 is much smaller than the value quoted in eq .",
    "( [ duvirb ] ) . while such models can at present not be excluded , the pattern of the individual contributions appears more unnatural than in the main model ( [ bru ] ) : the known @xmath21 can only be reproduced when one allows for large cancellations between the individual terms .",
    "thus , the behaviour generally expected from the presence of renormalon poles , namely dominance of leading ir poles at intermediate orders , would be lost .",
    "this is apparent from table  [ tab2 ] , which is the analog of table  [ tab1 ] , but for a model where @xmath59 is forced to be zero and an additional ir pole at @xmath70 is added , in order to be able to reproduce the known adler function coefficients .",
    "on the one hand for low coefficients there are huge cancellations between the ir renormalon poles and also @xmath66 is not well described at all .",
    "this entails that a large , additional polynomial term is required . besides , it appears unnatural that the residue of the first ir renormalon pole at @xmath52 is small , and still there should be a natural size contribution of the gluon condensate to the adler function .",
    "a graphical account of the model with @xmath71 is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] . as anticipated ,",
    "now cipt provides a good description of the borel sum , while fopt is able to come reasonably close to it around its minimal term , but generally is rather badly behaved . nonetheless , again",
    ", the behaviour observed in table  [ tab2 ] and figure  [ fig2 ] appears unnatural from the perspective of the structure of the borel transform of the adler function and should be considered less likely than the behaviour of the model ( [ bru ] ) with the residues ( [ duvirb ] ) .",

    "the straight line represents the result for the borel sum of the series.[fig2],width=294 ]    in the standard @xmath0 determinations from hadronic @xmath1 decays @xcite , besides the total decay rate also moments of the spectral decay distributions are employed .",
    "historically , the so - called @xmath73-moments were used , for which a polynomial @xmath74 is multiplied to the kinematical weight function from phase - space . in the analyses @xcite , moments with @xmath75 and @xmath76 were taken into account , such that also condensate contributions up to dimension-8 could be extracted in addition to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to analyse the behaviour of these moments in models of higher orders of perturbation theory as well",

    "[ fig3],width=294 ]    an example of such an analysis is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for the moment @xmath79 .",
    "it is observed that , like for @xmath14 , cipt is unable to provide a reasonable account of the full borel sum .",
    "in contrast , fopt comes close to the resummed result for perturbative orders around the minimal term , though it is obvious that this particular moment displays a very bad behaviour of the asymptotic series , with only unsatisfactory convergence up to its minimal term .",
    "the example of the @xmath79-moment should motivate an exhaustive investigation of the moments employed in previous @xmath0 analyses from hadronic @xmath1 decays , which will be presented in the near future .",
    "models of higher orders of perturbation theory allow for the study of different resummation prescriptions in the computation of the total @xmath1 hadronic width , as well as related moments of @xmath1 decay spectral distributions .",
    "the most prominent methods are fixed - order perturbation theory ( fopt ) and the so - called contour - improved perturbation theory ( cipt ) , which performs a partial resummation of running effects of the qcd coupling @xmath0 in the integration along the complex contour in the @xmath24-plane .    a physically motivated model for the higher - order behaviour of the adler function was presented in ref .",

    "results for @xmath14 in the main model ( [ bru ] ) were displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] , and it is observed that while fopt provides a good account of the full borel summation , cipt is never able to come close to the resummed value .",

    "moments of the decay spectra are employed @xcite .",
    "an example of the behaviour of such a moment was shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the repeatedly unacceptable behaviour of cipt in this case and the also unsatisfactory convergence of fopt , suggest that such moments should be investigated systematically , before their usefulness in @xmath0 determinations from hadronic @xmath1 decays is corroborated .    a final topic , not touched upon at all so far , are violations of quark - hadron duality @xcite .",
    "like the perturbative expansion in @xmath0 , also the ope in inverse powers of @xmath24 may be only asymptotic , and thus exponentially suppressed terms could be relevant close to the minkowskian axis where the bound states are situated .",
    "this was investigated in a model in @xcite and the possible influence of duality violations in @xmath1 decay spectra was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . also here",
    "a more systematic investigation seems to be in order which was initiated in @xcite and will be continued in the future .",
    "hadronic @xmath1 decays have proven to be a very fruitful laboratory for the study of low - energy qcd and the extractions of fundamental qcd parameters like the coupling @xmath0",
    ". however , there remain unresolved theoretical issues which taint the precision of these determinations .",
    "numerically the two most relevant appear to be the resummation of qcd running effects in the computation of the @xmath1 hadronic width and related decay moments as well as duality violations .",
