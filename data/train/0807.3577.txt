    "accelerated expansion , modeled by a positive cosmological constant , is an essential element of the current standard cosmological model of the universe .",
    "the accelerated expansion was originally motivated by supernova observations @xcite and is supported by many other types of cosmological observations .",
    "observational data is , in modern cosmology , analyzed almost exclusively within the framework of homogeneous and isotropic friedmann models @xcite .",
    "this analysis leads to the concordance model , which provides a remarkably precise fit to cosmological observations .",
    "in this situation , if the ehlers - geren - sachs theorem @xcite and ` almost egs theorem ' @xcite are invoked , then it seems that an assumption of large scale homogeneity of the universe can be justified .",
    "this on the other hand implies that the universe must be filled with dark energy which currently drives the acceleration of the universe .",
    "however the concordance model is not the only one which can fit cosmological observations .",
    "anti - copernican inhomogeneous models which assume the existence of a local gpc scale void also fit cosmological observations @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "moreover , on small and medium scales our universe is not homogeneous",
    ". therefore , one may ask whether friedmann models can describe our universe correctly .",
    "in particular , it is important to ask what is the best way to fit a homogeneous model to a realistic and inhomogeneous universe .",
    "this problem , known as the fitting problem , was considered by ellis and stoeger @xcite . in considering the fitting problem",
    ", it becomes apparent that a homogeneous model fitted to inhomogeneous data can evolve quite differently from the real universe .",
    "the difference between evolution of homogeneous models and an inhomogeneous universe is caused by backreaction effects , due to the nonlinearity of the einstein equation .",
    "unfortunately , in the standard approach , the backreaction is rarely taken into account  in most cases",
    "when modelling our universe on a local scale newtonian mechanics is employed and on large scales the friedmann equations ( or linear perturbations of friedmann background ) are used @xcite .",
    "such an approach to cosmology is often encouraged by the `` no  go '' theorem which states that the universe can be very accurately described by the conformal newtonian metric perturbed about a spatially flat background , even if @xmath4 . in such a case",
    "the backreaction is negligible @xcite .",
    "however , the results obtained by van elst and ellis @xcite and recently by kolb , marra and matarrese @xcite show that the application of `` no - go '' theorem is limited .",
    "therefore , one should be aware that in the absence of an analysis of the backreaction and other effects caused by inhomogeneities in the universe , there remains the possibility that the observed accelerated expansion of the universe is only apparent @xcite .",
    "the direct study of the dynamical effects of inhomogeneities is difficult . due to the nonlinearity of the einstein equations ,",
    "the solution of the einstein equations for the homogeneous matter distribution leads in principle to a different description of the universe than an average of a inhomogeneous solution to the exact einstein equations ( even though inhomogeneities when averaged over a sufficiently large scale might tend to be zero ) .    neither the analysis of the evolution of a general matter distribution nor the numerical evolution of cosmological models employing the full einstein equations are available at the level of detail which would make them useful for this problem .",
    "there are currently several different approaches which attempt to take backreaction effects into account .",
    "one approach is based on exact solutions ",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "another , and more popular approach is based on averaging .    in the averaging approach to backreaction ,",
    "one considers a solution to the einstein equations for a general matter distribution and then an average of various observable quantities is taken .",
    "if a simple volume average is considered then such an attempt leads to the buchert equations @xcite .",
    "the buchert equations are very similar to the friedmann equations except for the backreaction term which is in general nonvanishing , if inhomogeneities are present . for a review on backreaction and the buchert averaging scheme",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite . within this framework and using spherically symmetric inhomogeneous models nambu and tanimoto @xcite , paranjape and singh @xcite , kai , kozaki , nakao , nambu , and yoo @xcite , chuang , gu , and hwang @xcite , provided explicit examples that one can obtain negative values of the volume deceleration parameter even if @xmath5 .",
    "another interesting example was presented by rsnen @xcite where it was shown that the total volume deceleration parameter of two isolated and locally decelerating regions can also be negative .",
    "there are however important ambiguities in the application of an averaging procedure .",
    "the average itself not only depends on a choice of volume but also on a choice of time slicing .",
    "this is very crucial in cosmology .",
    "once inhomogeneities are present the age of the universe is not everywhere the same .",
    "namely , the big bang in inhomogeneous models is not a single event , so the average taken over a hypersurface of constant cosmic time @xmath6 is different from the average taken over a hypersurface of constant age of the universe @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the results of the averaging procedure vary if the discrepancy between the average cosmic time and the local time is introduced ( the local time is the time which is measured by local clocks ; the cosmic time is the time which appears in the averaged homogeneous model ) .",
    "this phenomenon was studied by wiltshire @xcite , and has been used in an ambitious alternative concordance model .",
    "the model proposed by wiltshire introduces some additional assumptions which allow to some extent a comparison of averaged quantities with observations .",
    "such a comparison shows quite good agreement with observations , @xcite .",
    "thus , while serious fundamental questions remain concerning wiltshire s approach , it is another example of an approach where one does not need dark energy to fit cosmological observations .",
    "the averaging procedure is also gauge - dependent .",
    "for example using different gauge one can obtain that the backreaction mimics not dark energy but dark matter @xcite .",
    "the averaging schemes , therefore , in the literature have been criticized , and their inherent ambiguities ( and in some cases obscurity ) have been discussed , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "a key point is that it is far from obvious if the average quantities , such as the acceleration of the averaged universe are really the quantities which are measured in astronomical observations . in particular ,",
    "an operational analysis is to a large extent lacking in the discussions of averaging .",
    "thus , it is important to test the averaging procedures with the exact and inhomogeneous solutions of the einstein equations . within exact models each quantity can easily be calculated and then compared with its averaged counterpart .",
    "this paper aims to perform such an analysis within the lematre  tolman model .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "buchert s averaging procedure is presented in section [ bssec ] , and some background on the lematre  tolman model is given in section [ ltsec ] .",
    "the volume and distance deceleration parameters are introduced in section [ dpsec ] .",
    "finally , in section [ qasec ] , we discuss the relation between the deceleration parameters , supernova observations and models of cosmic structures .",
    "if the averaging procedure is applied to the einstein equations , then for irrotational and pressureless matter the following equations are obtained @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is an average of the spacial ricci scalar @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the scalar of expansion , @xmath12 is the shear scalar , and @xmath13 is the volume average over the hypersurface of constant time : @xmath14 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath15 is defined as follows :    @xmath16    where v@xmath17 is an initial volume .",
    "equations ( [ bucherteq1 ] ) and ( [ bucherteq2 ] ) are very similar to the friedmann equations , where q=0 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on time only .",
    "in fact , they are kinematically equivalent with a friedmann model that has an additional scalar field source @xcite .",
    "however the buchert equation do not form a closed system . to close these equation",
    "one has to introduce some further assumptions @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ qdef ] ) if the dispersion of expansion is large , q can be large as well and one can get acceleration ( @xmath20 ) without employing the cosmological constant .",
    "the lematre  tolman model @xcite is a spherical symmetric , pressure free and irrotational solution of the einstein equations .",
    "its metric is of the following form    @xmath21    where @xmath22 . because of the signature @xmath23 , the @xmath24 function must obey @xmath25 prime @xmath26 denotes @xmath27 .",
    "the einstein equations reduce , in @xmath0 case , to the following two @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is another arbitrary function and @xmath31 .",
    "dot @xmath32 denotes @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the density becomes infinite .",
    "this happens at shell crossings .",
    "this is an additional singularity to the big bang that occurs at @xmath36 . by setting the initial conditions",
    "appropriately the shell crossing singularity can be avoided ( see @xcite for detail discussion ) .",
    "equation ( [ vel ] ) can be solved by simple integration :    @xmath37,\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 appears as an integration constant and is an arbitrary function of @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the big bang is not a single event as in the friedmann models , but occurs at different times at different distances from the origin .",
    "the scalar of the expansion is equal to    @xmath40    the shear tensor is of the following form :    @xmath41    thus @xmath42 .",
    "the spacial ricci scalar in the lematre ",
    "tolman is equal to    @xmath43",
    "the deceleration parameter within the friedmann models is defined as    @xmath44    where @xmath15 is the scale factor . by analogy",
    "we can define the deceleration parameter which is based on the averaging scheme . substituting ( [ aave ] ) into ( [ decparflrw ] ) and using ( [ bucherteq1 ] ) and ( [ bucherteq2 ] )",
    "we get    @xmath45    we refer to this deceleration parameter as the _ volume deceleration parameter _ , @xmath2 since it is positive when the second derivative of volume is negative and negative when the second derivative of volume is positive ( and of sufficiently large value ) .    on the other hand one",
    "can introduce a deceleration parameter defined relative to the distance . within homogeneous models the distance to a given redshift is larger for accelerating models than for decelerating ones .",
    "taylor expanding the luminosity distance in the friedmann model we obtain @xmath46 employing a similar procedure in the case of the lematre  tolman model we get @xmath47 thus by comparing ( [ dllt ] ) with ( [ dlfl ] ) , the hubble and the deceleration parameter in the lematre  tolman model can be defined as @xmath48 the above quantities are defined at the origin ( @xmath49 ) . however , following the partovi and mashhoon @xcite we can extend the above quantities to any @xmath39 .",
    "then , the coefficients of taylor expansion are    @xmath50    and we obtain    @xmath51    we refer to this deceleration parameter as the _ distance deceleration parameter_. although of physical importance is the luminosity distance and its ability of fitting the supernova data , the @xmath52 is of great usefulness .",
    "it allows us , without solving the geodesic equations , to easily check whether a considered model can be use to fit supernova data . as we will see in the next section , models which fit supernova data have at least in some regions @xmath53 .",
    "let us first focus on supernova observations .",
    "there is already a considerable literature on inhomogeneous models which are able to fit the supernova observations without the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "we shall examine four such models in this section .",
    "for each of these models we shall calculate the volume and distance deceleration parameters and compare with each other .",
    "the four models to be considered present a very good fit to supernova data .",
    "the supernova data consists of 182 supernovae from the riess gold sample @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 test for models 1 - 4 is respectively 183.6 , 184.3 , 164.7 , and 178.5 ( for comparison the @xmath54 of fitting the @xmath55cdm model is 165.3 ) . the residual hubble diagram for these models is presented in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the deceleration parameters for models 1 - 4 are presented in figure [ f2 ] . left panel",
    "presents the distance deceleration parameter [ as defined by ( [ qdis ] ) - where @xmath56 and @xmath57 were calculated for the radial geodesic ] . the distance deceleration parameter is positive at the origin , but soon becomes negative .",
    "moreover , a very similar shape is obtained if instead @xmath52 [ as defined by ( [ qdis ] ) ] @xmath58 [ as defined by ( [ qddf ] ) ] is used .",
    "thus , @xmath52 ( or even @xmath58 , if treated as a function of @xmath39 ) can be regarded as a useful test to check if a given model is able to fit supernova data . however , the most significant is that the volume deceleration parameter which is presented in the right panel of figure [ f2 ] is strictly positive .",
    "thus , the ability of reproducing the supernova data does not require that the volume deceleration parameter is negative .",
    "this raises the question whether the average acceleration has any relation with the observed acceleration of the universe ; and if yes , are models with average acceleration also able to fit supernova data ?     for the @xmath55cdm model . ]",
    "let us now focus on models of cosmic structures .",
    "it was recently shown that using a perturbative approach , backreaction can not explain the apparent acceleration @xcite . however , because of large density fluctuations within cosmic structures , results obtained in terms of the perturbation framework might be questionable . moreover , in view of the fact that there are known examples of exact inhomogeneous models with negative volume deceleration parameter and @xmath5",
    ", it is worthwhile to check if realistically evolving models of cosmic structures can have negative values of deceleration parameter .",
    "first , let us consider a model of galaxy clusters with the navarro - frenk - white density distribution @xcite ( left panel of figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "although , the nfw profile describes virialized systems the use of this profile will prove to be very instructive .",
    "the average deceleration parameter @xmath2 for model 5 is presented in the right panel of figure [ f3 ] . as can be seen in this case",
    "the deceleration parameter is positive ( curve 5a ) .",
    "however , it is possible to modify this model so that the @xmath2 becomes negative ",
    "curve 5b in the right panel of figure [ f3 ] .",
    "this was obtained by choosing the @xmath59 function which is of large positive value ( for details see appendix ) . however , after such a modification this model becomes unrealistic .",
    "specifically , the age of the universe in this model becomes unrealistically small .",
    "the bang time function @xmath38 in this model is of large amplitude , around @xmath60 y. this means that the actual age of the universe in this model is approximately a few hundreds of thousand years .",
    "now let us examine the volume deceleration parameter within models of cosmic voids and superclusters .",
    "figure [ f4 ] presents density distribution of realistically evolving cosmic structures ( void  curve 6 , supercluster ",
    "curve 7 ) .",
    "it can be seen from the right panel of figure [ f4 ] that the volume deceleration parameter within these models is positive .",
    "as above , we can modify our models in such a way that the volume deceleration parameter is negative , but again this leads to a very large amplitude of @xmath38 .",
    "for example , in model 8 whose density and the volume deceleration parameter are presented in figure [ f5 ] the volume deceleration parameter is negative",
    ". however , the bang time function in model 8 is of amplitude @xmath61 y , which leads to unrealistically small age of the universe .",
    "in this paper we have studied the relation between the volume deceleration parameter obtained within the buchert averaging scheme and the deceleration parameter derived from the observations of supernovae .",
    "this work was motivated by recent results showing there there are models which despite @xmath0 and average expansion rate is accelerating , i.e. @xmath62 [ where @xmath15 is defined by relation ( [ aave ] ) ] .",
    "this opens the possibility that backreaction and averaging effects may be used as an interesting alternative explanation to the dark energy phenomenon .",
    "we have compared the quantities obtained within the exact and inhomogeneous models with their average counterparts .",
    "we focused on the supernova observations and models of cosmic structures .",
    "for this purpose the lematre  tolman model was employed .",
    "it was showed numerically that the averaging of models which fit the supernova observations does not lead to volume acceleration ( @xmath63 for these averaged models and hence @xmath64 ) .",
    "it was also shown that realistically evolving models of cosmic structures have also @xmath64 .",
    "it was possible to modify these model in such a way that after the averaging @xmath65 .",
    "this was obtained by choosing @xmath59 function of positive amplitude - as was recently proved by sussman @xcite this is a necessary condition to obtain @xmath65 . however , in models with realistic density distribution , in such a cases , @xmath66 , hence as seen from ( [ evo ] ) @xmath67 ( to remind @xmath68y @xmath69 gpc ) .",
    "thus , within such models the age of the universe is unrealistically small .",
    "our analysis has been performed in the limited class of lematre  tolman models , which due to their spherical symmetry are arguably too simple to give a full understanding of averaging and backreaction problems . however , within this class , we conclude that the volume deceleration parameter @xmath2 is not a quantity which can be directly related to observations .",
    "it is possible that the volume deceleration parameter @xmath2 becomes negative only after averaging over the scales which are larger than 100 mpc . on such large scales",
    "the structure of the universe becomes too complicated to be fully described by spherically symmetric models .",
    "however , it is intriguing that models which fit the supernova observations and for which the distance deceleration parameter , @xmath52 , is negative have still @xmath70 .",
    "this suggest that the volume deceleration @xmath2 does not have a clear interpretation in terms of observable quantities .",
    "it does not , of course , mean that averaging and backreaction effects can not potentially be employed to explain the phenomenon of dark energy .",
    "however , our work here indicates that such a potential solution of the dark energy problem should be based upon different methods than those related to volume deceleration parameter . rather than showing that @xmath71 the averaging approach should explain observations  reproduce correct values of distance to supernovae , correct shape of the cmb power spectrum , etc .",
    "an interesting , quasi - friedmannian approach , was recently suggested in @xcite . in this approach backreaction",
    "is modeled in terms of the morphon field @xcite .",
    "in such a case a universe is describe by a homogeneous model with the spatial curvature being just a function of time . as shown in @xcite such approach lead to an agreement with supernova and cmb data without the need for dark energy , but requires @xmath71 .",
