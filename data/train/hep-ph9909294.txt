    "one of the great unsolved questions of contemporary physics is the wide difference between the scales of two fundamental interactions of nature , the gravitational and the electroweak . denoting with @xmath0 the gravitational constant",
    "it indeed follows that the planck ( @xmath1gev ) and the electroweak ( @xmath2gev ) scales differ by seventeen orders of magnitude .",
    "the standard model  @xcite ( sm ) successfully describes the electroweak interactions but leaves this difference unexplained .",
    "while the sm is tested by the present colliders at distances comparable to @xmath3 , the experimental knowledge of the gravitational force reach only distances around a centimetre  @xcite , thirty three orders of magnitude above its characteristic distance @xmath4 .",
    "a recent theoretical scenario  @xcite , proposes a modification of the present description of the gravitational force in this large unexplored domain .",
    "a scale @xmath5 of the order of @xmath6 is postulated for quantum gravity , then referred to as low scale gravity ( lsg ) .",
    "the known behaviour of the gravitational force is recovered by the existence of @xmath7 new space dimensions of size @xmath8 such that : @xmath9    a single extra dimension with @xmath10 is ruled out as it implies values of @xmath8 comparable to the dimensions of the solar system .",
    "two or more extra dimensions correspond to @xmath11 mm , in the unexplored regime of gravity .",
    "severe limits are derived for @xmath12 from sn1987a  @xcite .",
    "spin two gravitons are predicted to propagate in @xmath13 dimensions and interact with sm particles with a sizeable strength .",
    "the effects of graviton exchange diagrams in vector boson pair production are predicted to be experimentally accessible  @xcite at the cern @xmath14 collider lep .",
    "data collected by the four lep experiments up to july 1999 on photon , w and z pair production are investigated to search for these effects .",
    "the four lep experiments have studied  @xcite the differential distribution of @xmath16 events collected above the z pole to extract limits on the qed cut  off parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "they are defined by an additional term in the @xmath16 cross section  @xcite :    @xmath19    @xmath20 is the polar photon production angle , @xmath21 the square of the centre  of  mass energy and @xmath22 the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "no signals of deviation from qed are observed by any of the experiments that quote the 95% confidence level ( cl ) limits presented in table  1 .",
    "these limits are obtained with a maximum likelihood fit to the distribution of @xmath23 in data with equation  ( [ equation : qedlimits ] ) with @xmath24 as a free parameter . the limits @xmath25 and @xmath26 follow from the integration of the likelihood functions @xmath27 over the physical region @xmath28 :    @xmath29    .reported limits on the qed cut  off parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 at 95% cl [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "since 1996 lep is running above the w pair production threshold .",
    "the combined  @xcite results of the four experiments for the @xmath33 cross section at different @xmath34 are reported in table  3 .",
    "sm prediction obtained with the koralw  @xcite monte carlo program are also listed .",
    "the lsg contributions to w pair is described at born level in reference  @xcite . to take into account higher order corrections",
    "the following procedure is applied .",
    "first the sm @xmath35 cross section is calculated from the born level amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "then a correction factor @xmath36 is calculated as the ratio of the koralw cross section to this born level calculation at different energies .",
    "the values of @xmath36 are reported in table  3 .",
    "this correction factor is assumed to hold for lsg diagrams as well .        ' '' ''    @xmath34 ( gev ) & @xmath37 ( pb ) & @xmath38 ( pb ) & @xmath36 + 172 & @xmath39 & 12.40 & 0.82 + 183 & @xmath40 & 15.70 & 0.89 + 189 & @xmath41 & 16.65 & 0.92 + 192 & @xmath42 & 16.97 & 0.93 + 196 & @xmath43 & 17.28 & 0.95 +    the @xmath35 cross section in presence of lsg is calculated from the matrix elements  @xcite and multiplied by @xmath36 . from the comparison of this value with data at the different energies",
    "a likelihood function is built .",
    "it takes into account the experimental uncertainties quoted in table  3 and a 2% uncertainty on the theoretical treatment of the initial state radiation .",
    "this likelihood function is displayed in figure  1 in terms of @xmath44 and shows no significant deviations from the sm .",
    "lower limits on @xmath5 are derived by integrating the likelihood over the physical region and are summarised in table  2 .",
    "the sensitivity of the ww channel to lsg effects is limited by the initial state radiation error . in the hypothesis of its reduction",
    "to 0.5%  @xcite the tightest of these limits would improve to 0.99 tev .",
    "in 1997 the pair production of z bosons became accessible at lep .",
    "the four collaborations reported a combined measured cross section of @xmath45pb at @xmath46gev and @xmath47pb at @xmath48gev  @xcite .",
    "the sm predictions are 0.26pb and 0.65pb respectively , as calculated with yfszz  @xcite .",
    "the lsg matrix element for z pair production is similar to the w pair one  @xcite .",
    "the same procedure described above is used to extract limits on @xmath5 .",
    "the values of the correction factor @xmath36 to the born level predictions for the @xmath49 cross sections with respect to the yfszz ones are 1.12 and 0.80 at 183gev and 189gev , respectively .",
    "figure  1 presents the likelihood function used to determine the limits in table  2 .",
    "the impact of the theory uncertainty in this channel is negligible when compared to the experimental one .",
    "assuming that no higher order operators contribute to equation  ( [ equation : gglimits ] ) and to the lsg zz and ww matrix elements , and the meaning of @xmath5 is the same for all the investigated channels , the three likelihood functions described above can be added .",
    "the combined likelihood function is found to be in agreement with the sm predictions as shown in figure  1 .",
    "lower limits on @xmath5 at 95% cl can be derived as 0.92tev and 0.96tev for @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "the second of this limits does not improve the @xmath52 one as the effect of the @xmath53 likelihood is to shift the combined maximum toward higher values without a major narrowing of its width .",
    "the lep data on bhabha scattering were also recently analysed in terms of possible lsg contributions  @xcite .",
    "the original likelihood is inferred from the quoted limits with the same procedure used for the @xmath16 process and is added to the combined likelihood described above .",
    "the @xmath54 95% cl lower limit on @xmath5 reads then 1.01tev , improving the limits of both the boson and bhabha analyses . the @xmath55 limit derived from the bhabha scattering dominates this combination that does not improve it .    in conclusion",
    "the first limits on lsg from combined lep data for all vector boson pair production processes are derived , improving those reported by the single collaborations  @xcite .",
    "a combined analysis of boson and fermion pairs improves the sensitivity to lsg effects .",
