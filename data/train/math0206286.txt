    "in connection with the spherical space form problem , pitts and rubinstein @xcite raised the question of whether embedded minimal surfaces of fixed genus in a three - manifold have bounded morse index . an area bound on minimal surfaces of fixed genus would imply an index bound , however in @xcite it was shown that on any three - manifold there exists an open set of metrics for which there are embedded minimal tori of arbitrarily large area .",
    "these minimal tori have morse index zero . in this paper",
    "we construct metrics for which there are embedded minimal spheres of arbitrarily large morse index .",
    "we use the techniques from @xcite to study circle invariant metrics and reduce the problem to one of finding a family of geodesics of arbitrarily large index on a surface equipped with a metric that degenerates at the boundary .    on any three - manifold",
    "there exists a metric for which there are embedded minimal spheres of arbitrarily large morse index . on the three - sphere",
    "it can be chosen to have non - negative ricci curvature .",
    "the ricci curvature of each example of the theorem is non - positive somewhere .",
    "each of the metrics on the three - sphere constructed by the theorem possesses an arbitrarily small perturbation to a positive ricci curvature metric .",
    "if a manifold has a metric of positive ricci curvature then there is an area bound on the embedded minimal spheres @xcite and hence a bound on their index .",
    "thus the property of the existence of embedded minimal spheres of arbitrarily large morse index is destroyed by the perturbations .",
    "using completely different methods , colding and hingston @xcite have constructed metrics on any three - manifold with embedded minimal tori of arbitrarily high index .",
    "this is complementary to the work here since the conjecture of pitts and rubinstein @xcite requires a morse index bound on a compactification of the space of embedded tori which includes both spheres and tori .",
    "consider the product metric on @xmath0 given by the euclidean line times the round two - sphere : @xmath1 where @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] are spherical coordinates on the two - sphere .",
    "this is invariant under rotations by @xmath4 , and the quotient metric is @xmath5 defined on @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "geodesics on the quotient surface have little to do with minimal surfaces upstairs since the lengths of the orbit circles vary .",
    "instead , following @xcite we adjust the metric by @xmath7 , the lengths of the orbit circles : @xmath8 this is a metric on @xmath6 $ ] degenerate on the boundary , and its geodesics pull back to minimal surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "its curvature is @xmath9 .    the equation for geodesics is given by : @xmath10 and ( [ eq : geod1 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath11 so @xmath12 for a constant @xmath13 .",
    "the constant @xmath13 is equal to zero precisely when the geodesic is vertical ( @xmath14 constant ) and thus meets the boundary . for all other geodesics",
    "@xmath15 is always positive or always negative .",
    "the speed @xmath16 is a conserved quantity and we may set it to be @xmath17 .",
    "thus , @xmath18 so from ( [ eq : rdot ] ) , @xmath19 for non - vertical geodesics @xmath20 is strictly positive so @xmath21 is bounded away from @xmath22 and @xmath23 , or in other words the boundary repels the geodesic  see figure  [ fig : repel ] .",
    "the maximum and minimum values of @xmath21 of the geodesic satisfy @xmath24 and the geodesic is periodic by the translation and reflection invariance of @xmath25 .",
    "this is much like the construction in @xcite for the round metric on @xmath26 .",
    "the major difference is that the period of the geodesics can be made arbitrarily small in our case whereas there is a lower bound for the period in @xcite .",
    "[ th : period ] the period , in @xmath27 , of the geodesic with minimum @xmath28 is less than @xmath29 .    from ( [ eq : rdot ] ) and",
    "@xmath30 we get @xmath31 by symmetry one quarter of a period of the geodesic is given by the following integral : @xmath32    the _ energy functional _ on the space of paths between points @xmath33 and @xmath34 in a manifold @xmath35 is defined to be the integral of the square of the norm of the derivative along the path .",
    "if we simply integrate the norm along the path then this gives the length functional .",
    "the critical points of the energy functional coincide with the critical points of the length functional , and thus are the geodesics .",
    "the hessian of the energy functional is a bilinear form with finite index and nullity  the dimension of the largest negative eigenspace , respectively the null space .",
    "it is non - degenerate if the nullity is zero .",
    "for generic @xmath33 and @xmath34 the energy functional is morse .",
    "that is , its critical points are non - degenerate @xcite .",
    "along any geodesic @xmath36 , the energy functional can be defined on an initial interval @xmath37 $ ] say .",
    "the geodesic is non - degenerate for generic @xmath38 , and its index remains the same for nearby generic values of @xmath38 .",
    "it is important to note that the energy functional is defined on a different set of paths for each @xmath38 and in particular that the tangent spaces change  the infinitesimal variations are given by vector fields that vanish at @xmath22 and @xmath38 .",
    "on each side of a non - generic value of @xmath38 the index of the geodesics can be related , leading to the morse index theorem .",
    "the points @xmath33 and @xmath34 are conjugate along a geodesic @xmath39 joining them if the nullity of @xmath39 is non - zero , or in other words the geodesic is a degenerate critical point of the energy functional .",
    "thus along @xmath39 there exists a null vector field or equivalently a _",
    "jacobi vector field _ that vanishes at @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "a jacobi vector field is a vector field @xmath40 defined along @xmath39 that satisfies the jacobi equation : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the covariant derivative along @xmath39 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the curvature of the metric .",
    "more generally , any two points on @xmath39 are conjugate along @xmath39 if there exists a jacobi vector field along @xmath39 that vanishes at the two points .    the morse index theorem states that the index of a geodesic is equal to the number of points conjugate to one of its endpoints .",
    "the conjugate points are counted with multiplicity which is @xmath17 on a surface .    on the surface with metric ( [ eq : degmet ] )",
    "there are geodesics with arbitrarily high index .",
    "this uses lemma  [ th : period ] which tells us that for any @xmath45 , when @xmath13 is small enough the geodesic with minimum @xmath46 meets @xmath47 at least @xmath48 times , and the next lemma in which we show that this gives a lower bound of @xmath48 for the morse index of the geodesic .",
    "the index of a geodesic is bounded below by half the number of times it meets @xmath47 .    along any geodesic @xmath39 with minimum @xmath46",
    ", choose a piece @xmath49 that travels a full period .",
    "in the next paragraph we show there exists a pair of conjugate points along @xmath49 , and thus by the morse index theorem , the index of @xmath49 is at least 1 .",
    "that is , there exists a vector field along @xmath49 that vanishes at its endpoints and on which the hessian of the energy functional is negative definite .",
    "extend this to @xmath39 by setting it to be zero outside @xmath49 .",
    "do this along consecutive pieces of the geodesic @xmath39 to get a set of vector fields on which the hessian of the energy functional is diagonal and negative definite .",
    "hence the index of a geodesic is bounded below by half the number of times it meets @xmath47 .",
    "since the gaussian curvature of the metric is bounded below by 1 we can use the rauch comparison theorem to deduce that the distance between conjugate points is at most @xmath23 .",
    "the length of @xmath49 is given by : @xmath50 where we have used the substitution @xmath51 .",
    "thus the length of a geodesic along its full period is greater than 4 so contains conjugate points by the rauch comparison theorem .",
    "we can improve the previous lemma and bound the index of a geodesic below by the number of times it meets @xmath47 .",
    "a minimax argument shows that the index of a piece of the geodesic that travels from @xmath47 to its minimum and back  half the period  is 1 .",
    "this uses a sequence of sweepouts between two index zero geodesics  the horizontal geodesic along @xmath47 and the degenerate piecewise geodesic consisting of two vertical geodesics from @xmath47 to @xmath52 together with a path ( of zero length ) along the boundary .",
    "the minimax is an index 1 geodesic .",
    "perturb the product metric on @xmath0 to get @xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the metric is defined only for @xmath27 satisfying @xmath58 .",
    "we also require that @xmath59 when @xmath60 so that the metric is smooth as @xmath61 .",
    "the metric on @xmath6 $ ] degenerate on the boundary is @xmath62 the equation for geodesics is given by : @xmath63 or , alternatively @xmath64 put @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "this gives a @xmath69 metric .",
    "a family of solutions to ( [ eq : implicit ] ) is @xmath70 for @xmath71 and a constant @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "we uniquely continue to a periodic solution on @xmath68 .",
    "each of these geodesics meets the boundary at right angles , at @xmath73 or @xmath74 , and passes through the focal point @xmath75 at an angle of @xmath76 with the line @xmath77 . as @xmath78 , @xmath79 .    for a given @xmath80 ,",
    "countably many of these solutions meet @xmath81 since as @xmath76 gets smaller , so does the period and geodesics with a period of @xmath82 for @xmath83 meet @xmath84 and @xmath77 at @xmath47 . if we reflect the metric in @xmath85 , @xmath86 then we have a constructed an infinite family of geodesics with arbitrarily large index that run from the boundary to the boundary . these lift to compact minimal surfaces in @xmath26 .",
    "the metric on @xmath26 is obtained from the round metric by cutting @xmath26 along a totally geodesic @xmath87 and gluing in the product @xmath88\\times s^2 $ ] of the euclidean metric times the round metric .",
    "the surfaces have arbitrarily large index since by @xcite jacobi fields lift to jacobi fields upstairs and we can use a generalisation of the morse index theorem by simons @xcite to get a lower bound for the index .",
    "in this section we construct smooth metrics with similar properties to the @xmath69 example in the previous section .",
    "the main differences are that we do not have an explicit formula for the geodesics and there is no focal point .",
    "we call a geodesic that meets the boundary a _ boundary geodesic . _ for particular smooth functions @xmath89 defined on a neighbourhood of @xmath77 the following properties hold :    1 .",
    "any boundary geodesic meets the boundary with known first and second derivatives .",
    "2 .   if we squeeze at a faster rate ( a condition on @xmath90 ) than for the @xmath69 example ( [ eq : c1 ] ) , then the geodesics ( [ eq : explicit ] ) form barriers for the boundary geodesics .",
    "3 .   there exist geodesics meeting all points of the boundary . 4 .",
    "the boundary geodesics meet the line @xmath77 at arbitrarily small angles .",
    "there exists a countable set of boundary geodesics with arbitrarily high index that must meet the boundary again as in figure  [ fig : boundary ] .",
    "the ricci curvature of the metric on the three - sphere can be chosen to be non - negative .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we give the proofs of these properties .",
    "the precise meaning of barrier in ( ii ) is given in lemma  [ th : barrier ] .",
    "proposition  [ th : exist ] contains the proof of ( iii ) . to prove ( iv ) we take geodesics meeting the boundary at arbitrarily small @xmath57 and use ( ii ) to show these geodesics meet the line @xmath77 .",
    "a second derivative estimate shows that the geodesics remain close to vertical there .",
    "as the geodesics become more vertical , their period along @xmath68 becomes smaller and the index becomes larger . for ( v )",
    "we prove that a countable set meet the lines @xmath84 and @xmath77 at the same value of @xmath21 and same angle ( with opposite sign . )",
    "these pull back to embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath26 of arbitrarily high index .",
    "the shortest path from any point to the boundary is a geodesic . if @xmath57 then it must meet the boundary at @xmath57 since any geodesic that crosses @xmath77 can not meet the boundary on @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath21 small enough , there is a unique shortest path to the boundary by the uniqueness of a minimal disk upstairs with boundary given by a small circle .",
    "a geodesic meets the boundary orthogonally since upstairs the circle action splits the tangent space of the fixed point into the invariant tangent plane of the minimal surface and its orthogonal complement pointing in the direction of the fixed point set . in other words",
    "@xmath92 at the boundary .",
    "the limit @xmath93 exists by smoothness of the minimal surface upstairs .",
    "it is equal to @xmath94 and we can calculate it using ( [ eq : implicit ] ) : @xmath95 any point on the boundary is met by at most one geodesic : if not then two such geodesics would lift to tangent minimal surfaces violating the maximum principle .",
    "in the following lemma we prove that the geodesics from the @xmath69 example in the last section act as barriers for the geodesics of metrics satisfying ( [ eq : barrier ] ) .",
    "we refer to the former geodesics as leaves of a foliation , to reduce confusion when talking about two sets of geodesics .",
    "the argument is quite easy .",
    "we prove that a geodesic of a metric that squeezes fast enough can only be parallel from the left to a leaf of the foliation .",
    "a geodesic that moves away from the left of a leaf can not return to that leaf since it would have to meet another leaf at a tangent from the right . here",

    "the point @xmath97 lies to the left of @xmath98 when @xmath99 .",

    "[ th : basic ] , a boundary geodesic meets @xmath101 with @xmath92 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , near @xmath52 the boundary geodesic lies to the left of the leaf @xmath104 .",
    "the leaves @xmath107 foliate the surface . if the boundary geodesic were ever to meet the leaf @xmath104 again then at some point it would be tangent to the foliation , from the right of a leaf .    if @xmath108 then @xmath109 for @xmath57 since @xmath110 . along the boundary geodesic with direction @xmath111 ( the tangent direction to the foliation ) ,",
    "from ( [ eq : implicit ] ) we have @xmath112 where we have replaced @xmath90 with @xmath113 since its coefficient is positive , and @xmath114 with @xmath115 since its coefficient is negative .",
    "compare this with the second derivative of the foliation @xmath116 @xmath117 then @xmath118    thus , if the geodesic is tangent to the foliation somewhere , the second derivative of the foliation is greater than that of the geodesic so the geodesic lies to the left of the leaf which contradicts the geometry described above , that it should lie to the right of the leaf .",
    "an implicit form of the geodesic equations is given in ( [ eq : implicit ] ) .",
    "in the following lemma we use this to show that geodesics that meet the boundary at @xmath52 near @xmath77 remain almost vertical .      by lemma",
    "[ th : barrier ] , if a geodesic meets the boundary at @xmath52 , then along the geodesic @xmath121 .",
    "this fact , together with @xmath56 shows that the equation ( [ eq : implicit ] ) expresses @xmath122 as a cubic polynomial in @xmath123 with negative coefficients .",
    "any such cubic polynomial @xmath124 , @xmath125 negative , satisfies @xmath126 for @xmath127 . in our case , this yields @xmath128 when @xmath129 .",
    "we can conclude that @xmath119 for @xmath71 as follows .",
    "if @xmath130 somewhere then as @xmath131 , either @xmath92 somewhere or @xmath132 somewhere . in the first case , @xmath92 implies that @xmath133 so immediately afterwards , @xmath129 . in the second case , the lower bound @xmath128 prevents @xmath134 from becoming too big , by the mean value theorem ( described in detail in the proof of the next lemma . )",
    "the statement of the lemma is equivalent to the following : for small enough @xmath21 if a geodesic satisfies @xmath135 somewhere then it does nt meet the boundary at @xmath52 . from this",
    "we deduce that a boundary geodesic satisfies @xmath136 near the boundary .    as in the proof of lemma",
    "[ th : monotone ] we use the cubic polynomial ( [ eq : implicit ] ) .",
    "when @xmath21 is small enough the cubic polynomial is strictly decreasing . to see this , differentiate ( [ eq : implicit ] ) with respect to @xmath123 .",
    "this is quadratic in @xmath123 with discriminant @xmath137 we require @xmath59 when @xmath60 so @xmath138 is bounded since its limit as @xmath89 vanishes is @xmath139 .",
    "thus , for small enough @xmath21 , ( [ eq : discriminant ] ) is negative so the polynomial ( [ eq : implicit ] ) is monotone .",
    "the unique zero of ( [ eq : implicit ] ) is negative .",
    "if @xmath135 somewhere then @xmath123 becomes more negative as @xmath21 decreases , and @xmath122 remains positive .",
    "in particular , as @xmath21 decreases so does @xmath123 .",
    "but if the geodesic were to meet the boundary whilst @xmath119 it would not meet with @xmath92 contradicting lemma  [ th : basic ]",
    ". thus it must repel from the boundary so @xmath130 and it can not meet @xmath52 by lemma  [ th : monotone ] .      take a sequence of points converging to @xmath101 and consider the shortest paths from each of these to the boundary . by lemma",
    "[ th : basic ] , when @xmath21 is small enough the shortest paths are unique .",
    "the remainder of the proof shows that this set of geodesics converges to a geodesic that meets the boundary at @xmath140 .",
    "the sequence of geodesics @xmath141 and the sequence of derivatives @xmath123 are equicontinuous families so by arzela - ascoli converge uniformly to a geodesic .",
    "equicontinuity follows from boundedness and lemmas  [ th : monotone ] and [ th : convex ] which supply a uniform bound on the second derivatives @xmath122 of the sequence of geodesics .      in lemma",
    "[ th : convex ] it was shown that when @xmath21 is small enough the polynomial ( [ eq : implicit ] ) has a unique zero .",
    "we can estimate it as follows .",
    "let @xmath142 be any small positive number .",
    "express ( [ eq : implicit ] ) as @xmath143 so",
    "if @xmath144 then for small enough @xmath21 this expression is positive . since ( [ eq : implicit ] ) is negative for @xmath92 , the unique zero lies in the interval @xmath145 .    from a point ,",
    "say @xmath146 for @xmath21 chosen small enough as in the previous paragraph , the closest point on the boundary satisfies @xmath147 since @xmath129 .",
    "it also lies under any straight line @xmath148 since the tangent direction to the shortest path must satisfy @xmath149 so that @xmath150 and by the convexity proven in lemma  [ th : convex ] , the geodesic lies under its tangent line .",
    "we have a geodesic running from @xmath152 to @xmath140 satisfying @xmath119 and @xmath128 by lemma  [ th : monotone ] .",
    "put @xmath153 at @xmath77 and recall that @xmath92 at @xmath154 . by the mean value theorem",
