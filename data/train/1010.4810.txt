    "in recent times , the study of complex systems has become a new paradigm for the search of a unified description of the mechanisms for emergence of organization , structures and functionality in natural and artificial phenomena in diverse scenarios ( mikhailov and calenbuhr , 2002 ; kaneko and tsuda , 2000 ; boccara , 2004 ) .",
    "one common feature found among the prevalent viewpoints on the meaning of complexity is emergent behavior : collective structures , patterns and functions that are absent at the local level arise from simple interaction rules between the constitutive elements in a system .",
    "phenomena such as the formation of spatial patterns , collective oscillations , synchronization of chaos in spatiotemporal systems , spiral waves , segregation and differentiation , growth of domains , motion of swarms , bird flocks , and fish schools , opinion consensus , and economic crashes are examples of self - organizing processes that occur in various contexts such as physical , chemical , physiological , biological and social and economic systems .",
    "the phenomenon of synchronization , where all the state variables of a system converge to a single trajectory in phase space , constitutes one of the simplest and more common collective behaviors occurring in networks of mutually interacting dynamical elements ( pecora and carroll , 1990 ; pikovsky et al . , 2002 ;",
    "manrubia et al . , 2004 ) . in particular",
    ", the study of chaos synchronization has provided insights into many natural processes and practical applications such as secure communications and control of dynamical systems ( boccaletti et al . , 2002 ;",
    "uchida et al . , 2005 ; argyris et al . , 2005 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "nontrivial collective behavior can also emerge in systems of interacting chaotic elements ( chat and manneville , 1992 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is characterized by an ordered evolution of macroscopic quantities coexisting with local chaos .",
    "synchronization and other collective behaviors in globally coupled oscillators are relevant in many chemical and biological systems and have been experimentally investigated ( wang et al .",
    "2000 ; de monte et al . , 2007 ; taylor et al . ,",
    "models based on coupled map networks have been widely used in the investigation of collective phenomena that appear in many complex systems ( kaneko and tsuda , 2000 ) . in particular",
    ", nontrivial collective behavior occurs in networks of coupled chaotic maps , such as regular euclidean lattices ( chat and manneville , 1992 ) , one - dimensional lattices ( cosenza , 1995 ) , fractal geometries ( cosenza , 1998 ) , and globally coupled systems ( kaneko , 1990 ; shibata et al . , 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relationship between complexity and the emergence of collective behaviors , such as synchronization and nontrivial collective behavior , in chaotic dynamical network models .",
    "we investigate the information transfer , as well as the information shared , between the global and local levels of the network as a condition for complexity or self - organization in spatiotemporal systems .",
    "specifically , we address the questions : how much information does a local unit possess about the collective dynamics of a system ? or how do the information flow and the complexity depend on parameters of a system ? .    in section 2",
    ", we present a globally coupled chaotic map network as a simple example of a system of interacting nonlinear elements that shows emergent collective behaviors .",
    "we calculate a measure of statistical complexity , introduced by lpez - ruiz et al .",
    "( lpez - ruiz et al . , 1995 ) , as a function of a parameter of the system and show that the appearance of nontrivial collective behavior is associated to higher values of complexity in comparison to those values for synchronization or for disordered states . similarly , we show that , as the parameter values for the onset of nontrivial collective behavior or chaos synchronization are approached , the information transfer from the macroscopic level to the local level is higher , in comparison to the situation where those collective states are already established in the system .",
    "our results are discussed in the conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 globally coupled chaotic maps , where the state of map @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) at discrete time @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution of the state of each map is assumed to depend on its own local dynamics and on its interaction with all the other maps in the system .",
    "thus , we consider a network of maps subjected to a mean field global interaction ( kaneko , 1990 ) @xmath5 where the function @xmath6 describes the local dynamics of element @xmath1 and @xmath7 is a parameter expressing the strength of the coupling . as local chaotic dynamics",
    "we choose a map belonging to the family of singular maps @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a real parameter ( alvarez - llamoza et al . ,",

    "1(b ) reveals the presence of global periodic attractors for some range of the coupling parameter .",
    "different collective states emerge as a function of the coupling @xmath7 : a turbulent phase ( t ) , where @xmath49 manifests itself as a global fixed point , a state where the time series of mean field fluctuates around a single value ; collective periodic states coexisting with local chaos , corresponding to nontrivial collective behavior ( ntcb ) ; collective chaotic bands ( c ) ; and chaotic synchronization ( s ) . in this representation ,",

    "global attractors of period @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are visible in figure  1(b ) . on the other hand , increasing the system size @xmath0 does not decrease the amplitude of the collective periodic orbits .",

    ", the complexity measure considers the macroscopical variable @xmath49 as laying in a single state , thus giving a small value of @xmath31 in the region t. the complexity @xmath31 remains small up to a critical value of the coupling @xmath58 , where @xmath31 suddenly increases , resembling a phase transition . as the periodicity of the collective orbit increases , more states are occupied by the probability distribution of the mean field @xmath49 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath49 corresponding to a periodic collective state is not uniform and consists of a set of distinct `` humps '' .",
    "a nonuniform probability distribution and few occupied states lead to larger values of the complexity @xmath31 , as observed in the region ntcb .",

    "there is little similarity shared by the global and local variables in the system and @xmath62 is small .",
    "however , as the coupling @xmath7 increases , the variables become more correlated and the mutual information reaches a maximum plateau in the synchronization region , as one may expect when variables become identical .",
    "we have calculated several quantities to characterize the emergence of collective behavior in a system of coupled chaotic maps as a function of a parameter expressing the strength of the coupling between the maps .",
    "we have employed maps displaying robust chaos as local dynamics because the emergence of ordered collective behavior in this kind of dynamical networks can not be attributed to the existence of windows of periodicity at the local level , but to the interactions between the constitutive elements .",
    "the mean field contains relevant information about the collective behavior of the system .",
    "our results show that the emergence of nontrivial collective behavior in spatiotemporal systems is associated to higher values of complexity in comparison to those values for synchronization and for disordered states .",
    "the increase of complexity can be interpreted as a manifestation of collective organization in the system .",
    "connectivity and coupling strengths are the mechanism for information exchange in networks of dynamical units . we have found that little transference of information from the macroscopic to the local level occurs when the system settles into nontrivial collective behavior and that no information is transferred at all between these two scales in a synchronized collective state . however , the information shared by the maps in the system is maximum at synchronization , as one may expect .",
    "these results can be related to those of cisneros et al .",
    "( cisneros et al . , 2002 ) who showed that the prediction error used to measure the mutual prediction error between a local and a global variable in a network of chaotic maps decreased when nontrivial collective behavior arises in the system .",
    "the information transfer that is required for the appearance of nontrivial collective behavior and chaotic synchronization takes place at some specific values of the parameters of the system . as the critical parameter values for the onset of nontrivial collective behavior or chaos synchronization are approached , the information transfer from the macroscopic level to the local level is greater , in comparison to the situation where those collective states are already established in the system .",
    "this result suggests that a surge of information flow from the global to local variables may serve as a predictor in parameter space for the occurrence of coherent or collective behavior in complex systems .",
