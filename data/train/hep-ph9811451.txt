    "the most attractive candidate for the solution of the strong cp problem is the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism@xcite . in this mechanism",
    ", there exists an axion which is the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson associated with the global @xmath0 pq symmetry breaking .    in the framework of gauge mediated supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking theories@xcite , we have proposed an interesting possibility@xcite to dynamically generate the pq symmetry breaking scale in a so - called hadronic axion model@xcite . a gauge singlet pq multiplet @xmath1 and colored pq quark multiplets @xmath2 and @xmath3 are introduced with the superpotential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a coupling constant . here",
    "we stress that no mass parameter is introduced .",
    "because in a supersymmetric limit the @xmath0 symmetry is enhanced to its complex extension , there appears a flat direction @xmath6 with @xmath1 undermined in the same limit .",
    "the effects of the susy breaking , however , lift the flat direction and fix the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar pq field @xmath1 . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have shown that the balance of the susy breaking effects between the gravity mediation and the gauge mediation stabilizes @xmath1 and gives the nonzero vev @xmath7 approximately as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the mass of a saxion field , the real part of the scalar component of @xmath1 .",
    "we estimate @xmath10 with a parameter @xmath11 of order unity . and @xmath12 is a mass scale fixed by the messenger sector of the gauge meditation mechanism .",
    "is roughly represented as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the f - component vev of the messenger singlet field and @xmath15 is the qcd coupling . ]",
    "a current scalar lepton mass limit suggests that @xmath16 gev . in the following analysis",
    ", we take the minimum value @xmath17 gev for a representative value .",
    "the axion arises when the @xmath1 field develops the non - vanishing vev .",
    "the decay constant of the axion ( the pq scale ) @xmath18 is constrained by various astrophysical and cosmological considerations .",
    "in particular the cooling of the sn 1987a puts a lower bound as @xmath19 gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper bound on @xmath18 comes from the overclosure limit of the axion abundance .",
    "the relic abundance of the axion due to the vacuum misalignment is given by@xcite @xmath20 with @xmath21 being an initial misalignment angle ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 the present hubble constant in units of 100 km / sec / mpc .",
    "thus this leads to @xmath24 gev . here",
    "it has been assumed that no entropy is produced after the qcd phase transition .",
    "if extra entropy production mechanism with a reheat temperature @xmath25 is operated after the transition , the estimate of the relic abundance changes as @xcite @xmath26 then the upper bound on the pq scale becomes @xmath27 gev for @xmath28 mev .",
    "note that the big bang nucleosynthesis implies that the reheating temperature should be higher than about 10 mev .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pqscale ] ) that , in the model we are considering , the allowed region for the pq scale discussed above @xmath29 can be translated to the allowed region for the saxion mass @xmath30 remarkably many models of the gmsb predict a gravitino mass in the above range .",
    "thus the model gives a very simple description of the pq breaking mechanism solely governed by the physics of the susy breaking .    in the model",
    ", however , the saxion has a very light mass which is comparable to the gravitino mass and its lifetime may be long .",
    "furthermore the saxion might be produced as a coherent oscillation too much .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will consider the cosmology of the model , especially the saxion cosmology , in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the subsequent section",
    ", we will discuss cosmological evolution of the saxion and estimate its relic abundance . in section",
    "ii , we will consider cosmological constraints on the saxion and show that our model survives the constraints if the reheating temperature of the inflation is sufficiently low . then in section iv",
    ", we will point out the possibility that the saxion plays a role of a late decaying particle , giving a better fit of the density perturbation in the cold dark matter scenario .",
    "final section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "let us begin by discussing the cosmological evolution of the saxion particle in an inflationary universe , and estimate its relic abundance .",
    "since the saxion has interaction suppressed by the energy scale @xmath18 , it decouples from the thermal bath of the universe when the cosmic temperature becomes about@xcite @xmath31 if the temperature achieved after the primordial inflation was higher than @xmath32 , the saxion could be thermalized and the ratio of the energy density of the saxion @xmath33 to the entropy density @xmath34 is estimated as @xmath35 even if the saxion was not thermalized , the saxion could be produced by scattering processes right after the reheating era . in this case the saxion abundance ( @xmath36 ) is given by @xmath37 where @xmath25 is the reheating temperature of the inflation ( @xmath38 mev ) and it is highly model dependent@xcite . in the gauge - mediated susy breaking models , since the longitudinal component of the light gravitino has interaction much stronger than the gravitational one , it would be abundant and overclose the universe unless the mass is lower than about 1 kev . to cure this",
    ", the reheating temperature @xmath25 must be sufficiently low@xcite like eq.([tr - gra ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath39 with such a low @xmath25 , the relic abundance of the saxion produced by the scattering in the thermal bath is highly suppressed .    on the other hand ,",
    "the saxion is also produced as a coherent oscillation .",
    "the scalar potential in general receives corrections at an early universe , e.g. during the primordial inflation .",
    "thus the saxion does not sit at the true minimum @xmath40 but is generically displaced at @xmath41 after the inflation .",
    "knowledge of the initial displacement @xmath42 is crucial to estimate the abundance of the oscillating saxion , but it depends on the details of supergravity lagrangian as well as inflation models . or @xmath43 may be naturally expected by the supergravity effect . ]",
    "thus in the following , we regard @xmath42 as an arbitrary parameter which is not larger than the planck scale ( @xmath44 gev ) and consider two distinct cases .",
    "let us first consider the case that the saxion field sits around the origin ( @xmath45 ) just after the inflation .",
    "symmetry is recovered . in this case",
    "it should be noted that , since the effective mass which the saxion feels during the primordial inflation is generally comparable to the hubble parameter during the inflation , the quantum fluctuations for the @xmath1 field are strongly suppressed@xcite . for special khler potential",
    ", a massless mode appears in the @xmath1 field and a large quantum fluctuation is expected .",
    "this would lead to too much axion isocurvature fluctuation . to suppress it",
    ", the mass density of the axion or the hubble parameter during the inflation should be small .",
    "we thank m. kawasaki and t. yanagida for pointing out this problem . ] in this case the pq quark multiplets ( @xmath2 and @xmath46 ) are in the thermal equilibrium through the rapid qcd interaction , which generates an additional mass term @xmath47 to the saxion potential as a finite temperature effect .",
    "thus the saxion is trapped at the origin till the cosmic temperature becomes below a critical temperature @xmath48 .",
    "we expect that @xmath48 @xmath49 gev , since the saxion obtains a negative soft susy breaking mass squared at the origin due to the renormalization group effect of the yukawa interaction eq.([sp - x ] ) and its absolute value is expected to be of the order of the electroweak scale @xmath49 gev .",
    "therefore the saxion starts to roll down toward its true minimum at @xmath50 and oscillates around it with the initial amplitude @xmath51 .. ] the ratio of the energy density of this oscillation to the entropy density is estimated as @xmath52 where @xmath53 counts the degrees of freedom of the relativistic particles ( @xmath54 at @xmath50 ) . here it should be noted that this ratio takes a constant value till the saxion decays if no extra entropy is produced , since @xmath33 and @xmath34 are both diluted by @xmath55 ( @xmath56 : the scale factor of the universe ) as the universe expands . in the model we are discussing ,",
    "the pq scale @xmath18 is given by eq.([f_pq ] ) and thus the abundance of the saxion oscillation reads @xmath57 note that it is independent of the saxion mass .",
    "here we have assumed that the reheating process of the primordial inflation completed before the saxion oscillation starts , i.e. , @xmath58 . on the other hand , for the case @xmath59",
    ", we expect a dilution of the saxion energy density .",
    "the saxion energy density at @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 from the fact that the radiation energy density is proportional to @xmath62 from the end of the inflation till @xmath60 , it follows that the ratio of the scale factor ( @xmath63 ) becomes @xmath64 thus the saxion abundance at @xmath60 is given by @xmath65 here note that the reheating temperature @xmath25 should be higher than about 10 mev in order to maintain the success of the big bang nucleosynthesis . comparing it with eq.([rs-01 ] )",
    ", we find that the relic abundance is diluted significantly by the primordial inflation with a very low @xmath25 .    the above discussion does also hold even for the case where the saxion is displaced from the origin @xmath42 by a small amount .",
    "this is because the pq multiplets will be thermalized and generate the potential which traps the saxion at the origin , as far as their effective mass ( @xmath66 ) is smaller than the maximum temperature achieved after the primordial inflation .",
    "achieved after the primordial inflation is given by@xcite as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the vacuum energy of the inflation . ]",
    "if the displacement @xmath42 is large enough , the cosmological evolution of the saxion is completely different . here , we consider only the case that @xmath69 .",
    "symmetry is broken and a massless mode , i.e. the axion , appears .",
    "see the footnote 4 for an argument on the density fluctuation of the axion field .",
    "] when the hubble parameter of the universe ( @xmath70 ) becomes @xmath71 , the saxion starts to obey the coherent oscillation .",
    "the potential is governed by the contribution from the gravity mediation effect , and the effective mass of the saxion is almost the same as the gravitino mass , i.e. , the saxion mass ( @xmath72 ) . ]",
    "the temperature at this time @xmath73 is estimated as @xmath74 using the initial amplitude of the oscillation @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , the saxion abundance of this oscillation is estimated as @xmath77 here we have assumed that the saxion oscillation starts after the reheating of the primordial inflation had been completed ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "however , such a high @xmath25 leads the gravitino problem for @xmath79 kev .",
    "comparison of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tsigma ] ) with the upper bound on @xmath25 [ eq.([tr - gra ] ) ] shows that @xmath80 is always higher than this bound . on the other hand ,",
    "the inflation with @xmath81 dilutes the energy density of the saxion as @xmath82 this ratio takes its minimum value for the lowest reheating temperature @xmath28 mev and the smallest initial amplitude @xmath51 .    to end this section we estimate the saxion lifetime . when the hubble parameter becomes comparable to its decay width",
    ", the saxion decay occurs . in the present model",
    ", the saxion dominantly decays into two axions with the rate @xmath83 and the lifetime is given as @xmath84 therefore the saxion becomes stable within the age of the universe ( @xmath85 sec ) if its mass is smaller than about 10 kev .",
    "note that the value @xmath86 varies very widely because of the strong dependence on the saxion mass .",
    "in this section we consider the cosmological constraints on the saxion abundance and examine whether the proposed model is viable or not .",
    "since the energy density of the saxion is not so suppressed compared to the radiation and also it may have a long lifetime , we have to carefully see its cosmological effects .",
    "as described in the previous section , the saxion is produced by the scattering at the reheating era and also as the coherent oscillation . comparing the both saxion abundances with each other",
    ", one finds that the saxion produced from the thermal bath can be neglected , if one assumes the primordial inflation with a relatively low reheating temperature to avoid the gravitino problem and too much relic abundance of the saxion oscillation",
    ". therefore it should be enough to consider only the saxion abundance coming from the oscillation in the subsequent discussion .",
    "first of all , the saxion with @xmath87 sec , i.e. , @xmath88 mev , may upset the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "existence of the extra energy of exotic particle at @xmath89 mev may speed up the expansion of the universe and increase the number ratio of neutron to proton , resulting in the overproduction of @xmath90he .",
    "roughly speaking , the energy of such a particle should be smaller than that of one neutrino species .",
    "thus the saxion abundance should satisfy @xmath91    furthermore , if the saxion lifetime is larger than the age of the universe ( i.e. , @xmath92 kev ) , the saxion oscillation still exists now . not to overclose the universe",
    ", the saxion abundance should be @xmath93 with the critical density @xmath94 and the present entropy density @xmath95 .",
    "next , we turn to the rare decay of the saxion .",
    "since the saxion is light enough in our model , it can not decay into two gluons but decays into two photons via one - loop diagrams if the pq quark multiplets have qed charges .",
    "thus we expect that the branching ratio of this radiative decay is very suppressed as @xmath96 .",
    "for example , if the pq quark fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in @xmath97 and @xmath98 under the su(5 ) gut gauge group , the branching ratio of the radiative decay is given as @xmath99 .",
    "even with such a small @xmath100 , extra photons produced at a late time are cosmologically dangerous .",
    "first , the saxion decay is constrained from the diffuse x - ray background spectrum .",
    "when the saxion has a lifetime longer than the cosmic time of the recombination ( @xmath101 sec ) , the produced photon directly contributes to the spectrum , and then a very stringent upper bound on @xmath102 comes from the present observation of the spectrum .",
    "( the details are found , for example , in ref.@xcite . )",
    "if the saxion lifetime is in between @xmath103 sec and @xmath104 sec , extra radiation energy produced by the saxion decay may alter the cosmic microwave background spectrum from the blackbody one .",
    "the observation by the cobe satellite@xcite gives the following upper bounds on the saxion abundances as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the cosmic temperature at the saxion decay and estimated as @xmath107^{2/3}.\\ ] ]    these constraints on the saxion abundance are summarized in fig.[fig : rsbr5d-6 ] for the case @xmath108 .",
    "note that the constraints from the x - ray background spectrum and the cmbr become weaker for the suppressed @xmath100 .",
    "we can now compare these cosmological constraints with the saxion abundance estimated in the previous section .",
    "first , we consider the case that the saxion is thermally trapped at the origin after the primordial inflation .",
    "for the case that the reheating temperature of the inflation is higher than the critical temperature ( @xmath109 gev ) , the saxion abundance [ eq([rs-01 ] ) ] significantly exceeds the upper bound eq.([bbn-1 ] ) from the big bang nucleosynthesis . to avoid this the saxion should decay before it , however the lifetime of the saxion is longer than 1 sec if @xmath88 mev . even for the case",
    "@xmath110 mev , the energy of the decay produced axion easily exceeds the bound eq.([bbn-1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this case , we conclude that @xmath59 .",
    "the saxion abundance [ eq.([rs-02 ] ) ] for @xmath59 takes its minimum value at the lowest @xmath111 mev , since the dilution of the inflation becomes most effective . in fig.[fig : rsbr5d-6 ] we show this lower limit of the saxion abundance with various cosmological constraints .",
    "note that now for the case @xmath112 mev , the pq scale as high as @xmath113 gev is allowed in the consideration of the relic abundance of the axion oscillation .",
    "it is found that all the region for the saxion mass is cosmologically allowed if we take the sufficiently low reheating temperature @xmath28 mev .",
    "furthermore the stable saxion with mass @xmath114 ev @xmath115 10 kev will constitute a dark matter of our universe , since the saxion could achieve @xmath116 without conflicting with the cosmic x - ray background observation .    in the above",
    "result an extremely low reheating temperature is crucial to dilute the saxion ( and also the gravitino ) .",
    "the new inflation model@xcite gives such a situation .",
    "for example , ref.@xcite gives a new inflation model which solves the initial condition problem , where the reheating temperature is given by @xmath117 where the gravitino mass should be larger than about 50 kev since @xmath118 10 mev . with this reheating temperature the saxion abundance ( [ rs-02 ] )",
    "is also shown in fig.[fig : rsbr5d-6 ] .",
    "it can be seen that with this new inflation model@xcite the saxion with @xmath119 50 kev-1 mev survives the various cosmological constraints .",
    "next we turn to the case that the saxion is displaced far from the origin after the primordial inflation . in order to avoid the overproduction of the gravitino",
    "we assume the reheating temperature of the inflation to be lower than @xmath73 ( even for the case that @xmath120 1 kev ) .",
    "the saxion abundance for @xmath121 is given as eq.([rs-12 ] ) and takes its minimum value when the minimum @xmath25 = 10 mev .",
    "in fig.[fig : consts0 ] we show the cosmological constraints on the initial amplitude @xmath122 in the saxion abundance eq.([rs-12 ] ) with @xmath25 = 10 mev .",
    "note that in this case the upper bound on the pq scale is @xmath27 gev .",
    "we find that most of the saxion mass ( or the pq scale ) is cosmologically allowed if we take @xmath123 . and",
    "when the saxion has a heavier mass @xmath124100 mev , the initial amplitude can take a value from @xmath123 to @xmath125 .",
    "similar to the previous case , the saxion with mass @xmath114 ev @xmath126 10 kev could be a dark matter of our universe .",
    "to summarize , the hadronic axion model we proposed is cosmologically viable in the both cases as far as the reheating temperature of the inflation is low enough .    to end this section",
    ", we emphasize that it has been assumed that no extra entropy production takes place other than the primordial inflation .",
    "if such a late - time entropy production like a thermal inflation@xcite or an oscillating inflation@xcite occurs , tremendous entropy is released at a late - time in the history of the universe ( but at least before the big bang nucleosynthesis ) and the saxion abundance is diluted by about @xmath127@xmath128 and cosmological constraints on it are extensively relaxed . thus our model becomes cosmologically viable even with the primordial inflation model with a high reheating temperature .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the cosmic energy of the saxion oscillation is abundant compared to the radiation and it may decay at very late time of the universe . in this section , we would like to argue that this feature of the saxion particle could explain well the present observed power spectrum of the cosmic structure with some cold dark matter@xcite , i.e. , the saxion can be a candidate for a late decaying massive particle ( ldp)@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the predicted spectrum of the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) with @xmath129 and @xmath130 could not fit well all the observational data simultaneously .",
    "the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) observed the anisotropy of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr)@xcite and gave the normalization of the spectrum at a large scale ( @xmath131mpc ) .",
    "however , this normalization predicts too much fluctuation at a small scale ( @xmath132mpc ) than galaxy distribution observations@xcite . the late decaying massive particle ( ldp ) , once dominating the energy of the universe before its decay , can delay the epoch of the matter - radiation equality compared to the standard cdm model , which results in the preferred spectrum@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite argued that the saxion can be accounted to be the ldp , if the saxion energy density satisfies @xmath133 to cause the saxion domination era , and @xmath134 to explain the observed power spectrum .",
    "here @xmath135 is defined as @xmath136^{3/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following we will take @xmath137 , which corresponds to the case that @xmath138 and @xmath139 . note that the saxion ldp also survives the big bang nucleosynthesis constraint ( [ bbn-1 ] ) . in fig.[fig : rsldp ] we show the saxion abundance required to become the ldp by using its lifetime [ eq.([tau - s ] ) ] . in the same figure , we also show various cosmological constraints .",
    "we find that the saxion whose mass is @xmath140 can be the ldp .",
    "however , such a saxion is severely constrained by the cmbr constraints [ eq.([cmbr-1 ] ) ] .",
    "mev is free from the cmbr constraint since the lifetime is short .",
    "] when the saxion becomes the ldp , the cmbr constraints give the upper bounds on the radiative branching ratio as @xmath141 therefore @xmath142 for the simple case that the pq quark multiplets @xmath2 and @xmath143 are @xmath97 and @xmath98 of the su(5 ) gauge group is marginally allowed .",
    "however , @xmath100 depends very much on their representation .",
    "here we claim that the observational bound of the cmbr at present is comparable to the prediction of the late decaying particle . in other words",
    "the late decaying saxion scenario presented here will be tested by more precise experiments of the cmbr in near future ( e.g. the experiments by the planck and map satellites ) .",
    "we will explain that the saxion abundance required for the ldp [ eqs.([cond - ldp1 ] ) and ( [ cond - ldp2 ] ) ] can be naturally offered in the present model .",
    "first , we consider the case that the saxion is trapped at the origin due to the thermal effects after the primordial inflation .",
    "using the relic abundance of the saxion eq.([rs-02 ] ) , the condition for the ldp [ eq.([cond - ldp2 ] ) ] leads to the required reheating temperature of the inflation as ) leads to the late decaying saxion which mass is @xmath144 which just lies in the required mass region [ eq.([ms - ldp ] ) ] . ]",
    "@xmath145 with the saxion mass eq.([ms - ldp ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that if we take the critical temperature as @xmath146 gev , the reheating of the inflation , which induces the required saxion abundance of the ldp , completes before the qcd phase transition . in this case",
    "the axion can constitute the dominant component of the dark matter of our universe if @xmath147@xmath104 gev .",
    "this pq scale corresponds to the saxion mass @xmath148 100 kev1 mev .",
    "therefore , in the considering model , if one takes the gravitino mass @xmath149 100 kev1 mev , the axion can be the cdm of our universe and moreover the saxion can be the late decaying particle to cure the difficulty in the power spectrum of the structure of our universe in the axion cdm model .    even if the saxion is displaced from the origin after the inflation , a similar argument holds . using the saxion abundance for @xmath150 [ eq.([rs-12 ] ) ] , the saxion which mass in eq.([ms - ldp ] ) becomes the ldp when @xmath151 therefore if we take the reheating temperature as @xmath152 , the gravitino mass @xmath153 100 kev1mev also leads to the axion cdm .",
    "thus the axion cdm and the saxion ldp scenario is achieved with the moderate @xmath25 and @xmath122 .",
    "so far we have assumed that there exists no extra dilution mechanism other than the primordial inflation in the history of the universe . here",
    "we will briefly discuss the case that there exists the late time entropy production such as the thermal inflation@xcite or the oscillating inflation@xcite .",
    "the idea of the late time entropy production is that a mini inflation takes place at a late time of the universe ( at least before the big - bang nucleosynthesis ) and produces tremendous entropy at the reheating epoch , which dilutes the unwanted particles extensively .",
    "if one assumes this dilution mechanism , the cosmological constraints on the saxion abundance become much weaker even for the saxion abundance [ eq.([rs-11 ] ) ] with @xmath125 . here",
    "we would like to stress that the saxion can play the role of the ldp even in this case .    in the universe with the late time entropy production it is worth noting that the string moduli could be the cdm .",
    "the moduli are scalar fields associated with flat directions which characterize classical vacua of the string theory and have only gravitationally suppressed interaction .",
    "the effects of the susy breaking give the moduli masses @xmath154 comparable to the gravitino mass ( @xmath155)@xcite . in fact if the moduli mass is @xmath156 kev , the condition @xmath157 could be achieved without conflict to the x(@xmath158)-ray observations after an appropriate amount of late time entropy production is taken into account@xcite .",
    "note that it extensively dilutes various dark matter candidates as well as the unwanted particles and they could not give a sizable contribution to the energy density of the universe .",
    "therefore , the string moduli seem to be a well motivated candidate for the cdm in the universe with the late time entropy production .",
    "gev may be another candidate for the dark matter @xcite .",
    "] when we consider the moduli cdm , we find that the saxion can play a role of the ldp if the saxion is displaced at @xmath43 after the primordial inflation .",
    "note that the moduli @xmath159 is also expected to be displaced from the true vacuum at the order of the planck scale , i.e. , @xmath160 .",
    "the both fields begin to oscillate at almost the same time , when the hubble parameter becomes @xmath161 . using the initial amplitude of the moduli ( saxion ) oscillation @xmath162 ( @xmath122 ) ,",
    "the energy densities of the oscillations are related as @xmath163 this equation also holds after some late time entropy production , since the both energy densities are diluted at the same rate .",
    "therefore , the saxion abundance is given by @xmath164 this abundance naturally explain the conditions of the saxion ldp eqs.([cond - ldp1 ] ) and ( [ cond - ldp2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , eq.([cond - ldp2 ] ) leads to the ratio of the initial amplitudes @xmath165 with the saxion mass in the region ( [ ms - ldp ] ) . here",
    "the moduli cdm implies @xmath166 .",
    "it should be noted that both initial amplitudes is expected to be of the order of the planck scale , @xmath167 .",
    "thus for @xmath166 the saxion with the initial amplitude @xmath122 which is slightly larger than @xmath168 could be the ldp even with the late time entropy production in the history of the universe , if the saxion has a mass in the region ( [ ms - ldp ] ) .",
    "on the other hand the string moduli could be the cdm of our universe ( @xmath166 ) if its mass is less than about 100 kev .",
    "therefore , if @xmath169 kev , the string moduli could be the cdm of our universe while the saxion could plays a role of the ldp so that the present observed power spectrum is well explained .",
    "it is interesting that this scenario will be tested in various cosmological experiments .",
    "the moduli cdm with mass @xmath170 100 kev will be tested in the future by the x - ray background observations with high energy resolutions@xcite .",
    "the line x - ray spectrum from the moduli cdm trapped in the halo of our galaxy will be seen . and the future cmbr observations , as mentioned before , reveal the saxion ldp possibility .",
    "in this paper , we closely investigated the cosmology of the hadronic axion model in the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking , which we had proposed in a previous paper@xcite .",
    "in particular we focused on the implications given by the saxion which is the scalar component of the axion supermultiplet .",
    "the saxion has a tiny mass comparable to the gravitino mass and thus its life time tends to be long and decay after the primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "furthermore since the saxion is a scalar field , it will be abundant in the early universe in the form of the coherent oscillation .",
    "thus the saxion may be cosmologically harmful .",
    "we estimated the energy density of the saxion in two distinctive cases for the cosmological evolution of the saxion coherent mode .",
    "then we examined whether or not the saxion survives the various cosmological constraints from the nucleosynthesis , from the critical density limit , from the diffuse x - ray background spectrum , and from the cosmic microwave background spectrum .",
    "we showed in both cases that the model we proposed is cosmologically viable , namely it satisfies the severe cosmological constraints on the saxion field , if the reheating temperature of the primordial inflation is sufficiently low .",
