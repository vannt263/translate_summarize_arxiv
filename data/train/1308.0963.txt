    "over the last decades there has been an ever growing interest in devising effective theories for complex systems in the natural sciences and engineering . in many situations",
    "it is a major mathematical challenge to derive such a reduced theory in a rigorous way as a limiting theory of basic physical principles . in this paper",
    "we are interested in variational models and in particular in applications to elasticity theory .",
    "a classical and elementary example is the derivation of linearized elasticity from non - linear elasticity in the limit of small displacements through a simple taylor expansion of the stored energy function .",
    "yet , the mathematically rigorous derivation , which moreover guarantees that energy minimizers of the non - linear theory converge to energy minimizers in the linearized regime , is non - trivial and has only been solved comparatively recently by dal maso , negri and percivale @xcite . with a view to the applications of our main abstract result , we also mention here the problem of finding geometrically linearized theories for energy functionals with multiple wells as studied by the second author in @xcite .",
    "an example of a complex multiscale system is a composite material with highly oscillatory material properties . here",
    "an effective theory is provided by a homogenization procedure of the stored energy function of the material , rigorously derived by braides @xcite and mller @xcite .",
    "we will discuss such materials in detail below and in particular revisit the question if homogenization and linearization commute which has been addressed by mller and neukamm @xcite and then by gloria and neukamm @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to prove an abstract ` @xmath0-closure result ' for sequences of @xmath0-convergent families : we show that under a suitable notion of equivalence of integral densities the limit of a @xmath0-convergent family of functionals is again a @xmath0-convergent family and the @xmath0-limit is given as a limit of the sequence of @xmath0-limits of the original problems . in this sense",
    "we in fact prove a stability result for @xmath0-convergent families .",
    "our motivation comes from a homogenization closure theorem proved by braides in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which enabled him to extend his homogenizability results to a class of almost periodic functions .",
    "also the aforementioned theorem of gloria and neukamm @xcite is in fact a closure theorem in the special case of elastic energy functionals with quadratic expansion at the identity for small displacements .",
    "the interest in such a @xmath0-closure theorem is twofold .",
    "firstly , it sheds a new light to a number of problems that have been studied over the last years . in particular , we will see that the results on linearization in @xcite , on geometric linearization in @xcite and on commutability in @xcite are direct consequences of our abstract theorem .",
    "secondly , our general method also allows for new applications . as an example we focus here on composite materials with multiple energy wells in the limit of highly oscillatory mixtures and small displacements and",
    "show that homogenization and geometric linearization commute .",
    "however , while all these examples concern the behavior of elastic materials at small displacements , our general scheme is not restricted to applications in elasticity theory .",
    "in contrast , we presume that our results are of interest in a variety of different problems .",
    "our @xmath0-closure theorems allow to analyze the effective properties of multiscale problems with two limiting parameters : they provide general criteria that guarantee commutability of the limits and stability results for simultaneous limits of the parameters .",
    "we believe that such results may be of particular interest , e.g. , in numerical schemes for multiscale problems , where a thorough understanding of the interplay of the small model parameter and the length scale of the numerical discretization is crucial .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ section : gamma - closure ] we prove our main abstract @xmath0-closure results for integral functionals first under standard growth assumptions on the densities in theorems [ theo : gamma - closure - single ] and [ theo : gamma - closure - variable ] .",
    "these theorems generalize a homogenization closure result of braides for quasiconvex integrands with standard growth , cf .",
    "@xcite , to general integrands inducing @xmath0-convergent families",
    ". a key ingredient of our proof is an equiintegrability theorem by fonseca , mller and pedregal @xcite .",
    "next we extend these results in our main theorems [ theo : gamma - closure - single - garding ] and [ theo : gamma - closure - variable - garding ] to functionals satisfying a ` @xmath1-garding type inequality ' ( see definition [ definition : garding ] ) .",
    "this generalization is motivated by our applications to elasticity theory , where realistic models in the small strain limit are incompatible with the assumption of standard @xmath1-growth assumptions from below . in theorem",
    "[ theo : gamma - closure - boundary - values ] we also consider these functionals with pre - assigned boundary values",
    ".    in section [ section : general - applications ] we collect a number of immediate consequences of our @xmath0-closure theorems . specializing to one parameter families , in theorems [ theo : perturbation ] and [ theo : relaxation ]",
    "we first obtain a perturbation result for @xmath0-convergent functionals and a relaxation result for sequences of integral functionals .",
    "we then note in theorems [ theo : commutability ] and [ theo : simultaneous - limits ] that under a suitable equivalence assumption on the densities the @xmath0-limits of a doubly indexed family of functionals commute and that in fact every diagonal sequence produces the same @xmath0-limit .",
    "our findings are finally specialized to the problem of homogenizing integral functionals of garding type in theorems [ theo : homogenization - closure ] and [ theo : homogenization - commutability ] .",
    "the last section [ section : elasticity ] is devoted to applications in elasticity and in particular to the simultaneous homogenization and geometric linearization of multiwell energies .",
    "the geometric rigidity result of friesecke , james and mller in @xcite implies that stored energy functions in realistic models induce garding type energy functionals to which our theory developed in the previous sections applies .",
    "we thus see that indeed homogenization and geometric linearization commute .",
    "we formulate theorem [ theo : multiwells ] similarly as in @xcite in terms of general ` homogenizable ' densities and note that this includes , in particular , the case of periodic and the case of ergodic stochastic material mixtures .",
    "moreover , we remark that all @xmath0-convergence statements can be complemented by observing compactness for finite energy sequences with pre - assigned boundary values , see remark [ remark : muwe],[rem : boundary - values - compactness ] .",
    "finally , we also note here that the ( geometric ) linearization and commutability results in @xcite are a direct consequence of theorem [ theo : multiwells ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be an open subset of @xmath3 . for a ( doubly indexed )",
    "borel function @xmath4 bounded from below and @xmath5 bounded and open we define the integral functional @xmath6 by @xmath7 for @xmath8 and taking the value @xmath9 otherwise . if @xmath2 itself is bounded we simply write @xmath10 . in view of our applications and also for notational clarity",
    "we choose the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the elements of a positive null sequence or @xmath13 .",
    "our main aim is to provide a rather general set of conditions which in applications are easy to check that allow for a @xmath0-closure result of the following type : if the functionals @xmath6 @xmath0-converge as @xmath14 for each @xmath15 and the densities @xmath16 are close to @xmath17 for @xmath18 and large @xmath19 in a suitable sense , then also the @xmath0-limit for @xmath20 exists and is given as a limit as @xmath21 of the @xmath0-limits for finite @xmath19 .      as a first step , in this section we consider densities of standard @xmath1-growth .",
    "more precisely , we state the following    * we say that the families @xmath22 and @xmath23 are equivalent on @xmath5 open , if @xmath24 for every @xmath25 .",
    "* recall that a family @xmath4 of functions is said to uniformly fulfil a standard @xmath1-growth condition , @xmath26 , if there are @xmath27 independent of @xmath19 and @xmath12 such that @xmath28 for almost all @xmath29 and all @xmath30 .",

    "assume that    * for each @xmath34 the @xmath0-limit @xmath35 exists and * the families @xmath22 and @xmath23 are equivalent on @xmath2 .",
    "then also @xmath36 exists and is the pointwise and the @xmath0-limit of @xmath37 as @xmath21 : @xmath38    1 .",
    "note that by theorem [ theo : standard - growth - gamma - compactness ] also the functionals @xmath37 , @xmath11 , are integral functionals with carathodory densities @xmath39 of standard @xmath1-growth .",
    "in fact , being densities of @xmath0-limits , the @xmath39 are quasiconvex in the second argument .",
    "our definition of equivalence of the sequences @xmath22 and @xmath23 is motivated by the notion of equivalence in the homogenization closure theorem [ theo : homogenization - closure ] , which has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the previous result can be extended to functionals on variable domains in a straightforward manner : for @xmath31 open ( not necessarily bounded ) , denote by @xmath40 the set of bounded open subsets of @xmath2 with lipschitz boundary .",
