    "early superhumps are periodic variations occasionally observed in wz  sge - type dwarf novae in their superoutbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "their period is extremely close to the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "their light curve has a double - peaked profile with different amplitudes .",
    "these characteristics of early superhumps suggest that they are caused by a different mechanism from that of ordinary superhumps , which are commonly observed in all su  uma - type dwarf novae ; the period of ordinary superhumps is a few percent longer than the orbital period , and the light curve generally has a saw - tooth profile with a prominent single peak ( @xcite ; @xcite ; for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude of early superhumps is @xmath3  mag , and is largest at the superoutburst maximum .",
    "then , early superhumps decreases in amplitude with time , and finally , ordinary superhumps supersede early superhumps @xmath4  d after the superoutburst maximum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , early superhumps are observed only in the early stage of superoutbursts of wz  sge stars .",
    "the mechanism of early superhumps is poorly understood .",
    "in contrast , the mechanism of ordinary superhumps have been understood in terms of the tidal dissipation in eccentric , precessing accretion - disks . a disk in a binary system",
    "is theoretically expected to have an eccentric form when it expands beyond the 3:1 resonance radius ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "wz  sge stars , the disk possibly expands far beyond the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "this is due to their extreme mass - ratios ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the secondary and primary masses ) , and the lack of normal outbursts ; thereby , a large amount of matter is expected to be stored before superoutbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , early superhumps are probably variations occurring in such a large disk , which definitely shows strong tidal distortion .",
    "an important feature of early superhumps is a large variety of their amplitudes ; it is larger than 0.4  mag in some objects , while it is smaller than 0.1  mag , or not significantly detected , in other objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "edge - on ( or a high inclination ) systems tend to exhibit large amplitudes of early superhumps .",
    "this feature suggests that early superhumps can be attributed to the rotation effect of a disk that has a non - axisymmetric vertical structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reproduce the light curve of early superhumps in bc  uma , assuming asymmetric spiral - patterns in the disk .",
    "@xcite propose that early superhumps are caused by a two - armed spiral pattern that is generated by the 2:1 resonance . in their model ,",
    "the observed amplitude can be explained when the geometrical effect of disks is considered , that is , the vertical expansion along the spiral pattern .",
    "sph simulations have shown the appearance of the two - armed spiral pattern at the 2:1 resonance radius ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a non - axisymmetrically expanded structure can be expected even without the resonance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "propose that early superhumps can be interpreted as irradiated emission of the elevated surface of the disk caused by the vertical tidal deformation . in order to evaluate those models , detailed observations",
    "have been long awaited for early superhumps .",
    "most recently , @xcite ( paper  i ) succeeded in measuring the color variations associated with early superhumps for the first time . in paper",
    "i , multi - band photometric observations during the superoutburst of v455  and were reported .",
    "the observations revealed that the hump component was redder than the stationary component .",
    "paper  i suggest that the source of early superhumps is a vertically - expanded low - temperature region , probably located in an outer part of the disk .",
    "in addition , it is interesting that the phase at which the object was reddest significantly shifted to the phase of the flux maximum .",
    "if the vertically - expanded region is limited at the outermost region , the flux maximum coincides with the reddest phase .",
    "the observed phase shift implies that a part of the vertically - expanded region is located not in the outermost part , but in a relatively inner part of the disks .    the idea of the reconstruction of the geometrical structure of disks is then motivated by the color behavior of early superhumps in v455  and .",
    "the phase of the humps would have information about the azimuthal structure of the disk , while the color of the humps would have information about the radial structure .",
    "therefore , the height of each point in the disk could , in principle , be reconstructed using multi - band light curves of early superhumps .",
    "it is well known that the intensity map of the disk in dwarf novae can be reconstructed by using a tomography technique ; the eclipse mapping uses the light curves of eclipses ( @xcite ) , and doppler tomography uses variations in emission - line profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these methods , we propose a new tomography method to reconstruct the height map of disks using early superhumps , which we call the `` early superhump mapping '' .    in this paper",
    ", we present our model for early - superhump mapping that is based on a bayesian technique .",
    "the model is described in the next section .",
    "we also present demonstrations of early superhump mapping using artificial data sets in this section . in section  3 ,",
    "we use this method for the light curves of v455  and .",
    "we discuss the dependence based on assumed parameters in the model and the temporal evolution of the reconstructed disk - structures . in section  4",
    ", the effect of irradiation is evaluated .",
    "we also discuss the physical implication obtained from the reconstructed disk - structure .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section  5 .",
    "we consider a disk with a height map , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is radial and azimuthal components in the cylindrical coordinate system whose origin is located at the disk center ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "we take the @xmath14-axis in the direction of the center of the secondary star , and the @xmath15-axis in the direction of the motion of the secondary .",
    "the center of the secondary star is located at @xmath16 , and the binary separation is set to be @xmath17 .",
    "hence , @xmath18 in this paper .",
    "our model assumes that all emission that we observe is that from the disk surface defined with @xmath19 .",
    "then , the observed flux density , @xmath20 , at a given frequency , @xmath21 , and a given phase , @xmath22 can be described as a function of the inclination angle , @xmath23 and @xmath19 .",
    "we develop a model to estimate @xmath19 from @xmath20 , assuming @xmath23 .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath19 is not only an inverse problem , but also a non - linear problem , because a part of the disk could be occulted by the other parts of the disk or by the secondary star .",
    "we approach this problem with a bayesian framework .",
    "our bayesian model estimates the posterior distribution of @xmath19 by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we calculate the flux from the disk at each phase using a similar method reported in @xcite .",
    "the disk surface is divided into small patches .",
    "a parch is defined as a closed region bounded by four segments of grid lines . in the azimuth direction ,",
    "the grids divide the disk into @xmath24 equally - spaced bins . in the radial direction ,",
    "the disk is divided into @xmath25 bins between the inner radius , @xmath26 and the outer radius , @xmath27 .",
    "the width of the radial bin is equally - spaced in a logarithmic scale ; the @xmath23-th coordinate in @xmath9 is described as @xmath28 .",
    "the center position , area , and normal vector of each patch are defined as the same manner as described in @xcite .",
    "each patch emits blackbody radiation with a temperature of @xmath29 at the center of the patch .",
    "we assume the following temperature distribution of the standard accretion disk model ( @xcite ) ; @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the temperature at the innermost part of the disk .",
    "the flux from each patch can be calculated from @xmath29 , the size and normal vector of the patch , and a viewing angle defined by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the flux in a given photometric band is calculated as the flux density of the blackbody radiation at the center wavelength of the band .",
    "we used @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 bands , and their center wavelengths were set to be @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41  @xmath42 , respectively .    the total flux at a given phase is a sum of the flux from all visible patches in the viewing direction corresponding to the phase .",
    "we consider the self - occultation in the disk ; that is , the flux from the patch is not counted if the center of a patch is occulted by the other patch .",
    "in addition , the eclipse of the disk by the secondary star is also considered .",
    "the flux from a patch is counted if the patch center is outside the roche - lobe area projected perpendicular to the viewing direction .",
    "we neglect the emission from the white dwarf ( wd ) and boundary layer .",
    "they mainly contribute to the high energy emission from an inner region , and less contribute to the emission from an outer region where the early superhump originates .",
    "thus , we calculate multi - band light - curves , @xmath20 from a set of @xmath43 . the model light - curves are normalized by the average flux for each band in order to be compared with the observed light - curves .      in general , a bayesian approach provides a means for estimating the posterior probability distribution of model parameters from the likelihood function and prior probability distribution .",
    "our bayesian model estimates the posterior probability of @xmath8 , @xmath44 .",
    "the model can be expressed as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the likelihood function and @xmath47 is the prior distribution .",
    "the normalization factor , @xmath48 is not important for estimating @xmath44 by using the mcmc method .",
    "the likelihood function , @xmath46 , is defined with the observed and model light curves for each band .",
    "the model light curve is derived from a given @xmath19 , as described in the last subsection .",
    "the model assumes that the observed fluxes have a gaussian distribution with a mean of the model fluxes and a variance of @xmath49 . here",
    ", @xmath50 corresponds to photometric errors of the observed light curve .",

    "the prior distribution , @xmath47 , is a function of @xmath19 , and essential to solve the present inverse problem .",
    "the prior probability distribution in our model consists of two components .",
    "the first one is for the smoothness of the disk structure .",
    "it has a form : @xmath53 ^ 2 \\over 2w^2}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\exp\\left(-{[h_{l , m}-2h_{l , m-1}+h_{l , m-2}]^2 \\over 2w^2}\\right ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 denote the @xmath55-th and @xmath56-th grid points in the radial and azimuthal directions , namely , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "this prior distribution means that a sequence of the second difference of @xmath60 in the radial and azimuthal directions follows a normal distribution having a standard deviation of @xmath61 .",
    "a smoother height - structure provides a higher @xmath62 . the weight parameter @xmath61 plays a role in adjusting the smoothness of estimated disk - structures .",
    "the second prior distribution provides a default map of @xmath60 .",
    "it is widely accepted that the emission of outbursting dwarf - novae can be explained by the standard - disk model ( @xcite ) . in this model , viscous heating in the disk is balanced by cooling by blackbody radiation from the disk surface .",
    "its vertical structure is determined by hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the disk height is expected to be proportional to the radius in this scheme . in our model , we define , @xmath63 , and the prior distribution , @xmath64 as a product of truncated normal distributions with means and standard deviations of @xmath65 : @xmath66 ^ 2 \\over          2h_{{\\rm disk,}l , m}^2}\\right ) & ( h_{l , m}\\geq 0)\\\\     0 & ( h_{l , m}<0 ) .",
    "\\end{array } \\right .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this prior distribution is useful to reject a height map containing too large @xmath67 , which violates the assumption of the standard - disk model that the disk is geometrically thin .",
    "the assumed @xmath65 could be much larger than those expected in the standard disk of dwarf novae . according to @xcite , the disk height",
    "is estimated to be @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the sound speed and keplerian angular speed at distance @xmath9 , respectively . for typical parameters of dwarf novae ( @xmath71  k , @xmath72  cm , and @xmath73 )",
    ", it gives @xmath74 .",
    "this is one order smaller than that we assumed .",
    "however , we consider accretion disks that could be deformed by a strong tidal effect . in such a condition ,",
    "the hydrostatic balance definitely changes , and thereby the expected height - map could also change .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 defined in equation  ( 5 ) is a reasonable choice as a default map .",
    "the prior distribution of our model is , in total , expressed as @xmath47=@xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "taken together , we estimate @xmath77 having @xmath78 elements ( including disk edges ) , using @xmath79 photometric data .",

    ", we present a detailed description of our mcmc calculation . in the present work",

    "the above values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the allowable maximum ones in terms of the calculation time . the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath61 correspond to the weights of the likelihood and prior distribution components .",

    ", the obtained height maps successfully reproduce the general profile of the assumed disk structures .",
    "it should be emphasized that the model can properly resolve the structures in the radial direction , namely in the outer ( case  1 ) and inner ( case  2 ) structures , as well as the azimuthal direction . in case  3",
    ", the disk has two flaring parts .",
    "each of them has the same structure as case  1 .",
    "this is actually expected in double - peaked early superhumps .",
    "the model again succeeded in reconstructing the two - flaring structure , as can be seen in figure  3 .    on the other hand ,",
    "those demonstrations indicate that the early superhump mapping could produce spurious signals in the estimated height map .",
    "first , the peak heights are underestimated in all cases .",
    "the peaks were assumed to be @xmath87 and @xmath90 in cases  1 and 2 , although they were @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the reconstructed maps , respectively .",
    "in addition , the flaring areas were overestimated , or smeared out .",
    "these results were obtained because the prior distribution , @xmath62 favors smooth structures . as a result ,",
    "the model light curves partly failed to reproduce the substructures of the light curves ; in figures  1 and 2 , we can see dips around phase 0.25 in the light curves , which are not reproduced by the model .",
    "this dip is caused by occultation of the inner regions by the assumed flaring parts . in the reconstructed height map ,",
    "this flaring part should be higher than the estimated one in order to reproduce the dips .",
    "however , a disk with such a spiky structure reduces @xmath93 , and thereby reduces the posterior probability .",
    "thus , our model could fail to reproduce highly localized , or quite steep height - structures in the disks . in principle",
    ", those smoothing effects could be less significant if we apply a high @xmath61 in @xmath93 .",

    "second , in case  3 , low @xmath67 regions appear in both the left and right sides in the outermost parts in the reconstructed height map .",
    "the height was assumed to be constant at @xmath94 in the outermost region , except for the flaring parts .",
    "the model estimated @xmath95 in the left and right sides . as a result",
    ", the reconstructed disk apparently has not a circular , but a box - like height - map .",
    "this is also an artifact generated by @xmath62 .",
    "we should discuss reconstructed height - maps while paying attention to this low @xmath67 pattern when the double - peaked light curves are analyzed .",
    "finally , we can see that the height of the innermost region is slightly overestimated in all cases .",
    "they are estimated as @xmath96 .",
    "this is due to the prior distribution , @xmath64 . since it is a product of truncated normal distributions , as defined in equation  ( 5 ) , its median is slightly larger than @xmath65 . in the artificial data ,",
    "the light source is mainly in an outer region of the disk , and the contribution of the innermost region is relatively small .",
    "hence , the height there almost follows @xmath76 , and thereby slightly large @xmath67 are obtained .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that our method can reconstruct the general trend of accretion - disk structures , while reconstructed disks have several noteworthy artifacts in their structure . in the next section",
    ", we apply this model to real observations of early superhumps in v455  and .",
    "the parameter dependence is also discussed in the next section .",

    "we used the blue five - band observations on day  5 for the present study , since paper  i suggests that the @xmath97-band flux needs another emitting source in addition to the disk .",
    "high quality data not of all the five bands , but of two bands ( @xmath33 and @xmath36-band ) were also available on jd  2454352 ( day  3 ) .",
    "we can study the temporal evolution of the disk structure using those two sets of data .",
    "the light curves were phase - averaged into 20 bins .",
    "our model considers eclipses of the disk by the secondary star .",
    "hence , the epoch of ephemeris is important for the conversion from time to phase , because the timing of eclipses is sensitive to the orbital phase .",
    "@xcite derived an ephemeris of v455  and using pre - outbust data between 2000 and 2003 ; @xmath98 .",
    "based on eclipse observations after the 2007 superoutburst ( @xcite ) , we found that the orbital phase of the mid - eclipses is shifted by @xmath99 from those defined by the ephemeris in @xcite .",
    "it is quite likely that the phase shift is simply due to accumulated errors in the ephemeris . in the present study , we calculated the orbital phase with the ephemeris presented by @xcite , and then added @xmath100 to the phase .",

    "it is even deeper than the primary minimum in the blue @xmath32 and @xmath33-bands .    in the case of v455  and , intermittent short - term variations were occasionally superimposed on early superhumps ( see paper  i ) .",
    "for example , we can see a sharp spike at phase 0.62 in the light curve on day  5 .",
    "the observed light curve on day  5 is shown in figure  5 of paper  i. as can be seen from that figure , a temporary sharp spike appeared just after a primary maxima not in all humps , but only in a hump .",
    "another spike - like feature can be seen also in the light curve on day  3 at phase 0.68 .",
    "their short time - scale implies that they were originated from an inner high - temperature region , and have a different mechanism ( also see , @xcite ) .",

    "however , it is not a serious problem in the present study because we focus on stable and global structures of the disk .",
    "the model contains several parameters to be determined .",

    "in addition to those two major features , we can see flaring arm - like patterns elongated to relatively inner parts of the disk .",
    "they can be seen more conspicuously in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : v455d5map ] . in the left - lower quadrant",
    ", there is a `` spot''-like high region , which could be connected to the primary maximum part in the right - lower quadrant .",
    "this region includes the largest @xmath86 point among the whole disk , @xmath137 at @xmath138 .",
    "the observed deep secondary minimum in the light curves is generated by the occultation of inner regions by this flaring area .",
    "the relatively shallow secondary minimum of the model light curves implies that the flaring part would originally have a more localized structure with larger @xmath67 than the reconstructed disk .",
    "the other arm - like pattern can also be seen in the right - upper quadrant .",
    "its @xmath86 are relatively moderate ( @xmath139 ) compared with those of the left - lower arm .",
    "there are low regions in the outermost parts of both the left - lower and right - upper quadrants",
    ". this could be partly due to the spurious signal , as mentioned in subsection  2.3 . however , the height in those regions is even smaller than that of case  3 in subsection  2.3 in which @xmath140 ; in the case of figure  [ fig : v455d5map ] , the minimum @xmath67 point at @xmath141 has @xmath142 .",
    "it indicates that those low regions are not only a totally spurious signal , but also an intrinsic feature of the disk .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the dependence of the result reported in the last subsection on the assumed parameters .",
    "we recalculated the height maps for eight sets of different parameters of @xmath23 , @xmath107 , @xmath31 , and @xmath102 listed in table  [ tab : v455 ] , as labeled from cases  a to h. their height maps and model light - curves are depicted in figure  [ fig : parms_map ] and [ fig : parms_lc ] , respectively .",
    "in both figures , the middle - column panels show the same maps and light - curves as reported in the last subsection .",
    "( 165mm,165mm)parms_map.eps    ( 165mm,165mm)parms_lc.eps    the dependence of the result on @xmath23 can be seen in cases  a and b , in which we set @xmath143 and @xmath144  deg , respectively .",
    "these changes in @xmath23 required us to readjust @xmath31 to be consistent with the observed colors .",
    "we calculated @xmath145  k for case  a and @xmath146  k for case  b. the other parameters are the same as those of the default ones .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : parms_map ] , the global pattern of the height map is apparently insensitive to @xmath23 , while there are minor differences in the maps with different @xmath23 .",
    "first , the disk height apparently decreases as the increase in @xmath23 .",
    "this can be explained as follows : the amplitude of the humps can be considered as a ratio of the projected area of high @xmath67 region to low @xmath67 region on the plane perpendicular to the viewing direction . with a given height map ,",
    "the area ratio decreases with a decrease in @xmath23 .",
    "second , the model light curve of case  a fails to reproduce the deep secondary minimum , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : parms_lc ] . in a smaller @xmath23 case , like case  a",
    ", the disk is required to have higher @xmath67 to explain the observed amplitude .",
    "however , quite high @xmath67 values reduce the posterior probability , because @xmath64 becomes small .",
    "hence , the reconstructed map with a small @xmath23 fails to reproduce substructures in the light curve .",
    "another noteworthy feature of the height map is a high region around @xmath147 , which is unnaturally confined to a small region .",
    "it is most prominent in case  a , and less prominent in higher @xmath23 cases .",
    "this high region means that the inner region of the disk is required to be occulted at phase  @xmath148 to explain the observation . in a high-@xmath23 case ( case  b ) , the eclipse by the secondary star plays a role in hiding the inner region , and thereby the high region around @xmath147 disappears .",
    "it implies @xmath149  deg for v455  and in order to avoid making this unnatural feature .",
    "the mass ratio , @xmath107 , is one of the most uncertain parameters , while the reconstructed height maps are insensitive to small changes in @xmath107 , as shown in cases c and d in figure  [ fig : parms_map ] and [ fig : parms_lc ] . the height maps and light curves of cases",
    "c and d were calculated with @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively . in case",
    "c , a large @xmath107 slightly changes the binary separation , the inner radius , and as a result , the inner temperature , as shown in table  [ tab : v455 ] .",

    "the mass - ratio only has a minor effect on the results , because it is only related to the eclipse by the secondary star .",
    "the mass - ratio is so small , even in case  c , that the small changes in @xmath107 only lead to small changes in the roche lobe geometry .",
    "hence , the uncertainty in @xmath107 has no significant effect on the results in the case of wz  sge stars .",
    "the innermost temperature , @xmath31 , was estimated from the observed color .",
    "while we use @xmath155  k in the last subsection , it has a 1-@xmath50 error of @xmath156  k. hence , we should check the dependency of the result on @xmath31 . in cases",
    "e and f , we estimate @xmath19 with @xmath157 and @xmath158  k , which correspond to @xmath159 and @xmath160  k , respectively .",
    "the reconstructed height - maps are consistent each other , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : parms_map ] .",
    "thus , the reasonable changes in temperature have no significant effect on the results of the early superhump mapping .",
    "next , we evaluate the dependency of the results on the outer disk - radius , @xmath102 .",
    "we used @xmath161 in the last subsection , which is expected from the 2:1 resonance radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has , however , not been confirmed by observations . in cases",

    "the disk radius of case  g is close to the 3:1 resonance radius in wz  sge stars .",
    "the disk radius of case  h corresponds to the maximum radius allowed by the tidal truncation .",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath86 maps are quite similar in all cases with @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 . as a result , @xmath67 is larger in the case with larger @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the results of the early superhump mapping are insensitive to reasonable changes in the model parameters , @xmath23 , @xmath107 , @xmath31 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the inclination angle has a relatively large effect on the result .",
    "finally , we discuss the dependence of the reconstructed height map on the number of data .",
    "we evaluate it by comparing the height map calculated with two - band data with that with five - band data .",
    "figure  [ fig : v455d5vj ] shows the light curve ( upper panel ) and height map ( lower panel ) , which were calculated from @xmath33- and @xmath36-band data of v455  and on day  5 , instead of all five - band data . compared with figures  [ fig : v455d5lc ] and [ fig : v455d5map ] , the result obtained with the two - band data reproduces the major features of the height map obtained with the five - band data : the two outermost flaring regions and two inner arm - like patterns .",
    "the maximum @xmath67 in the height map calculated from the two - band data is only 6% smaller than that from the five - band data .",
    "the structures in both the light curve and height map are smoother than those obtained from the five - band data .",
    "this is due to the small amount of data , which makes the weight of the likelihood function small with respect to the prior probability .",
    "thus , we can obtain reconstructed height maps with a reasonable degree of accuracy , even in the case that only two - band data is available .",
    "high quality data were obtained on day  3 in paper  i , but only in the @xmath33 and @xmath36-bands . in the next subsection ,",
    "we report the results obtained from the data on day  3 .",

    "the height map on day  3 has common features with that on day  5 : the outermost flaring parts for the primary and secondary maxima of the light curve and the inner arm - like patterns .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)v455d3map.eps    on the other hand , there are several differences in the detailed structures between them , which represent a temporal evolution of the disk .",
    "the maximum height in the outermost part is @xmath167 on day  3 , while it is @xmath168 on day  5 .",
    "the amplitude of the light curve on day  3 is larger than that on day  5 .",
    "the large amplitude on day  3 is , therefore , due to the large @xmath67 .",
    "we confirmed that the disk temperature has only minor effect on the amplitude ; the amplitude keeps small with @xmath169  mag in the light curve calculated with the height map on day  5 and the temperature on day  3 .",
    "in general , early superhumps decrease in amplitude with time .",
    "our result suggests that it is due to the decrease in the disk height in the outermost region , rather than a decrease of the disk temperature .",
    "another noteworthy feature is the arm patterns . in figure",
    "[ fig : v455d3map ] , the right - upper arm has the largest @xmath86 on day  3 , while the left - lower arm has the largest @xmath86 on day  5 .",
    "the weakening of the left - lower arm is due to the shallow secondary minimum in the light curve on day  3 .",
    "no highly flaring region is required to reproduce such a shallow secondary minimum .",
    "the strong right - upper arm is required to reproduce the small dip at phase @xmath170 in the light curve .",
    "this dip feature may , however , be related to the short flare - like feature around phase @xmath171 ; the small dip feature could be a spurious signal generated by the intermittent short flare .",
    "the height of the right - upper arm could be overestimated if the flare - like feature around phase @xmath172 has a different origin from early superhumps .",
    "here , we compare the reconstructed disk - structures with theoretical ones which have been proposed for the origin of early superhumps . as mentioned in section  1 , @xcite propose the tidal distortion scenario , while @xcite propose the 2:1 resonance scenario .",
    "@xcite calculate the disk structure which is tidally distorted .",
    "they present the height map of a disk in a binary system with @xmath173 in their figure  2 .",
    "the tidally distorted disk also has two flaring parts in its outermost region .",
    "we find that the phases of the outermost flaring parts are consistent with those of our reconstructed map .",
    "in addition , the inner arm - pattern shown in their figure is reminiscent of the arm - pattern in the right - upper quadrant of the reconstructed image in figure  [ fig : v455d5map ] .",
    "thus , the global structure of the reconstructed image is similar to that expected from the tidal distortion .",
    "however , the tidal distortion scenario can not explain the arm - like pattern in the left - lower quadrant of the reconstructed image .",
    "this pattern is responsible for the secondary minimum in the light curve .",
    "as mentioned in subsection  3.2 , that area has a quite large @xmath86 , and possibly has a spot - like structure , rather than arm - like one . in conjunction with the height map on day",
    "3 , this feature probably evolved from day  3 to 5 .",
    "two scenarios can be considered to explain this flaring area .",
    "first , an additional effect may be responsible for it .",
    "the tidal effect may affect the global structure of the disk , while it is difficult to make such a well - localized structure .",
    "it could be related to the accretion stream from the secondary star or the evolving ordinary superhump . however , these scenarios are highly speculative .",
    "second , it is possible that the inner arm - like pattern is a spurious structure if the model assumptions are not valid for the real structure of the disks . in this case , the most controversial assumption is the temperature distribution of the disk , namely @xmath174 .",
    "if the temperature distribution is not axisymmetric , it could make a height map without the inner flaring region",
    ". the irradiation effect may be able to achieve such a condition .",
    "we evaluate it in the next subsection .",
    "we should note that the height distortion calculated by @xcite is for a binary system of @xmath173 , which is much larger than those of wz  sge stars ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "detailed studies should be carried out with theoretical disk - structure calculated with appropriate mass - ratios in the future .",
    "@xcite present sph simulations of disks which extend to the 2:1 resonance radius ( also see , @xcite ) .",
    "their result shows a two - armed density wave close to the outermost region in the disk .",
    "the phases of this two - armed pattern are consistent with the outermost flaring regions of our reconstructed map .",
    "however , it is difficult to compare the result of their sph simulation directly with our height map .",
    "a study of the height distortion expected from the sph simulations is also required in future .",
    "we evaluate the effect of irradiation to the early superhump mapping in this subsection .",
    "the temperature in the outermost flaring parts would increase by the irradiation effect . if this is the case , the temperature distribution could be non - axisymmetric , which may change the structure of the reconstructed height maps .",
    "the irradiation effect depends on the luminosity and geometry of the source for irradiation and the albedo of the irradiated surface .",
    "unfortunately , those parameters are poorly known . in outbursting dwarf novae ,",
    "the most powerful source for irradiation is supposed to be boundary layers , which are formed between the wd surface and the disk .",
    "x - ray and uv observations suggest that its temperature is typically on the order of @xmath176  k , while its size is poorly known ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature and geometry of boundary layers definitely depend on the accretion rate , which can change during outbursts .",
    "however , no estimation of the temperature and size of the boundary layer has been reported for v455  and .",
    "furthermore , v455  and is known as an intermediate polar ( @xcite ) .",
    "its physical condition in the innermost region of the disk could be different from that of non - magnetic dwarf novae in outburst . here",
    ", we focus on how the irradiation effect changes the disk structures estimated by the early superhump mapping .",
    "hence , we consider an extreme condition that the total luminosity , @xmath177 , is dominated not by the luminosity generated by the viscous heating , @xmath178 , but by the irradiation luminosity , @xmath179 , in the outermost part .",
    "we calculated the irradiation effect using a similar method reported in @xcite ; a patch on the disk surface is irradiated by the central source and other patches if there is no blocking patch between the centers of the source and patch .",
    "the central source for irradiation , which is probably dominated by the boundary layer emission , has a luminosity of @xmath180 .",
    "we assume that the radiation from the central source is isotropic .",
    "consider a patch , @xmath181 , whose size and normal vector are @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the patch @xmath184 receives energy from the central source by irradiation , and releases the energy by radiation with a luminosity @xmath185 , which is calculated as @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the fraction of the absorbed energy to the total irradiated energy in @xmath184 .",

    "otherwise , @xmath190 .",
    "@xmath191 denotes the unit vector in the direction of the patch center from the disk center .",

    "the weakening of the arm - like pattern is due to an increase of the temperature of the outermost flaring regions .",

    "this structure is required to occult the blue light originated from the inner high - temperature region . however , in the irradiated disks , the outermost flaring regions significantly contribute to the blue light .",
    "the deep secondary minimum can be reproduced if that phase corresponds to the position at which the contribution from those outermost high temperature regions is small .    on the other hand",
    ", the arm - like pattern can be seen even in the irradiated disk with @xmath207  k , while it weakens .",
    "this supports the presence of this feature in the disk .",
    "the arm - like pattern almost disappears when we assume a higher @xmath208 of @xmath209  k. the right panels in figure  [ fig : v455irr_map ] show height maps obtained with this high @xmath210 .",

    "the contribution is expected to be low because the irradiated area by the central source is small ; low - latitude regions are blocked by the disk .",
    "we calculated the irradiation effect of the secondary using the same manner as described above for the disk .",
    "the surface of the secondary was divided into 128 patches ( 16 and 8 bins in the longitude and latitude directions , respectively ) .",
    "the temperature was initially set to be 3000  k for all patches , and calculated with the irradiation effect for each patch .",
    "the model parameters for the disk was the same as the above case of @xmath207  k ( see table  1 ) .",
    "as a result , we confirmed that the irradiated region is limited in a latitude of 3580  deg .",
    "the maximum temperature is @xmath205  k. the total flux from the irradiated secondary is @xmath212 times that from the irradiated disk .",
    "its contribution is highest at phase  0.5 , where the irradiated region is facing to us , and lowest at phase  0.0 .",
    "this small contribution means that the amplitude of the light curve , which is caused by the geometrical effect of the disk , is 0.02  mag smaller than the observed light curve .",
    "compared with the typical photometric error of 0.01  mag , it leads to a marginal difference in the disk structure .",
    "we subtracted the secondary - star contribution from the observed light curve , and re - calculated the disk structure .",
    "the resultant height map has a global structure the same as that without the secondary - star contribution , while the disk height at the outermost region is slightly smaller .",

    "<S> in addition to the outermost flaring structures , flaring arm - like patterns can be seen in an inner region of the reconstructed disk . </S>",
    "<S> the overall profile of the reconstructed disk is reminiscent of the disk structure that is deformed by the tidal effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , an inner arm - like pattern , which is responsible for the secondary minimum in the light curve , can not be reproduced only by the tidal effect . </S>",
    "<S> it implies the presence of another mechanism that deforms the disk structure . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the disk structure with weaker arm - like patterns is optimal in the model including the irradiation effect . </S>",
