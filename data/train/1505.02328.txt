    "one major question in space physics is how collisionless plasmas in the extended corona and in the solar wind are heated .",
    "observations in the solar wind reveal that the fluctuations of the electric and magnetic fields show a turbulent spectrum similar to the power - law spectrum of fluid turbulence as described by kolmogorov @xcite .",
    "the turbulence in the solar wind shows mainly alfvnic polarization @xcite and becomes more anisotropic during the cascade to higher wavenumbers @xmath1 @xcite , resulting in @xmath2 at short wavelengths . at the proton scale ,",
    "the turbulence is thought to transition into a kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) cascade @xcite , which gradually dissipates energy to the particles @xcite .    despite the nonlinear nature of turbulence",
    ", linear theory has been used in studies of solar wind turbulence ( see , for instance , @xcite for review ) .",
    "these studies analyze turbulent fluctuations by means of the linear propagation and damping characteristics of kaws to help to understand the dissipation of the turbulence and the heating of the solar wind .",
    "the vast majority of these studies rely on representing the velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) by an isotropic or bi - maxwellian background ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we investigate how more realistic vdfs modify the damping of kaws . in the solar wind , both ions and electrons can be modeled by several populations drifting with respect to each other .",
    "recent studies show that the differential flow between ions affects ion heating by both ion - cyclotron waves @xcite and low - frequency kaws @xcite .",
    "the solar - wind electron vdf can be modeled as a superposition of three electron populations : a cool and dense `` core '' , a hot and less dense `` halo '' @xcite and a beam - like one - sided  strahl \" @xcite . in the proton frame ,",
    "core ( halo and strahl ) electrons drift sunward ( anti - sunward ) along the background magnetic field .",
    "empirically , the solar wind fulfills quasi - neutrality and the zero - current condition @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the fitting parameters for electron core properties is smaller than the uncertainty in the fitting parameters for halo and strahl properties .",
    "a drifting bi - maxwellian population models core electrons very well . in particular , the core electron bulk drift speed is usually comparable to or larger than the alfvn speed and shows a clear statistical dependence on collisional age @xcite . in the extrapolated asymptotic limit of no collisions ,",
    "the core drift is as large as three to four times the alfvn speed .    in this letter",
    ", we examine how the drift between electron core and halo affects the linear damping of kaws .",
    "we model the solar wind electrons by a superposition of a maxwellian core and a maxwellian halo drifting against each other in the proton frame . choosing a set of parameters typical for the solar wind",
    ", we solve the full hot - plasma dispersion relation of kaws in the framework of vlasov - maxwell theory and identify the contribution to wave damping from each plasma component .",
    "we show that , in the linear approximation , electron drifts can lead to significant variations in both the kaw damping rates and the relative energy transfer from the waves to protons and electrons , the latter of which is another important unsolved problem in turbulent plasma heating .",
    "motivated by observed solar wind electron vdfs , we consider a collisionless , homogeneous , and warm proton - electron plasma in a constant uniform background magnetic field .",
    "the proton temperature and density are denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; the electron distribution consists of two shifted maxwellian populations , a cool ( @xmath5 ) `` core '' and a hot ( @xmath6 ) `` halo . ''",
    "as an initial step to study the effects of core electron drifts on resonant damping , we use isotropic temperatures for all plasma components .",
    "both electron populations drift along the background magnetic field @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the proton frame .",
    "the halo electron drift adjusts to the core electron drift to guarantee the absence of net currents in the plasma : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote core and halo electron densities .",
    "figure [ fig : cartoon ] shows the plasma described above schematically .     for our resonance analysis in section [ sec : results ] . ]    under the assumption of strong anisotropy in kinetic scale fluctuations in the solar wind , we consider kaws with wavevectors at a large angle with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "we use constant values for the angle between @xmath13 ( wavenumber vector ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) , plasma beta , the electron - core - to - proton temperature ratio and the core - to - halo density ratio , so that the only free parameters are @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in particular , we allow @xmath14 to be either parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath17 , and @xmath13 has a finite component along @xmath14 . in principle , each configuration @xmath19 requires a separate treatment ; however , changing the direction of @xmath14 only inverts the direction of propagation and does not produce a new dispersion relation .",
    "therefore , we introduce the dimensionless core electron drift @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the proton alfvn speed .",
    "the values of the remaining parameters are given in table [ tab : plasma parameters ] .",
    "l |c quantity & value + proton plasma beta @xmath22 & @xmath23 + temperature ratio @xmath24 & @xmath25 + @xmath26 & @xmath27 + density ratio @xmath28 & @xmath29 + proton bulk drift @xmath30 & @xmath31 + angle between @xmath13 , @xmath14 & @xmath15 or @xmath16 +    we study the dispersion relations of kaws by numerically solving the full set of the linear maxwell - vlasov equations .",
    "linear maxwell - vlasov theory has been described in detail in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we summarize the relevant results here .",
    "linear plasma waves are eigenmodes of the wave equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fluctuating electric field in fourier space .",
    "the dielectric tensor @xmath34 incorporates contributions from each plasma component : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the susceptibility tensor for species @xmath37 .",
    "we obtain @xmath36 from the linearized and fourier - transformed vlasov equation and maxwell s equations .",
    "to study the contribution to wave damping ( growth ) from each component , we calculate the relative particle heating rates as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the anti - hermitian part of @xmath36 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the wave energy .    in the weak damping limit",
    ", @xmath42 gives the fraction of wave energy damped by plasma component @xmath37 during one wave period .",
    "the total heating rate @xmath43 corresponds to the wave energy dissipation rate directly calculated from the damping rate , i.e. , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the wave period , as long as @xmath47 is small compared to @xmath48 . in this letter , we focus on the linear damping of kaws .",
    "electron drifts may , however , alter wave  particle interactions to such a degree that the corresponding waves become unstable , which we note for the sake of completeness .",
    "notice that @xmath42 may become negative , corresponding to cooling of species @xmath37 .",
    "figures [ fig : panel1](a)-(b ) show dispersion relations of kaws in plasmas with @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "panel ( a ) demonstrates that electron drifts have little effect on the real part of the kaw frequencies , consistent with @xcite .",
    "indeed , the protons rather than the electrons mainly determine the dynamics of low - frequency kaws .",
    "panel ( b ) compares damping rates of kaws in plasmas with different electron drifts .",
    "negative ( positive ) @xmath50 lead to an enhancement ( reduction ) of the kaw damping at all wavenumbers . panel ( b ) shows that @xmath51 leads to an increase in the damping rate by @xmath52 compared to the case without electron drifts . for sufficiently large positive @xmath50 , kaws become unstable in certain wavenumber ranges .",
    "this instability is an example of a  heat flux instability \" @xcite .",
    "the two - population electrons in our model introduce an electron heat flux ( third moment of the electron vdf ) , which may provide energy to drive certain wave modes ( e.g. , whistler , alfvn , and magnetosonic ) unstable @xcite .",
    "these heat flux instabilities , in return , regulate the electron heat flux and hence the electron drifts .",
    "we note that there is no conflict between the damping and growth of kaws and other wave modes .",
    "for instance , parallel whistler waves , whose instability threshold is much lower than that of the alfvnic instability , are unstable even if @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the alfvnic instability can not regulate the electron heat flux in the solar wind and is more of academic interest under typical solar - wind conditions since the instability with the lowest threshold constrains the electron heat flux once triggered .",
    "figure [ fig : panel1](c ) compares the total particle heating rate ( solid ) with the wave energy dissipation rate ( dotted ) .",
    "when @xmath54 , _ i.e. _ , the wave retains more than half of its energy after a wave period , @xmath55 .",
    "hence we show that @xmath42 is a good measure of energy flow as long as damping is weak .    .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath47 are the real and imaginary parts of the wave frequency .",
    "@xmath56 is the proton gyro - radius , @xmath57 is the proton thermal speed , and @xmath58 is the proton gyro - frequency .",
    "( c ) : total particle heating rates ( @xmath59 , solid lines ) and wave energy dissipation rates ( @xmath44 , dots ) as functions of wavenumber . ]    figures [ fig : p_s vs k ] ( a)-(d ) present heating rates for protons , all electrons ( core + halo ) , as well as separately for core electrons and halo electrons . recall that positive @xmath42 indicates heating for species @xmath37 , and that negative @xmath42 indicates cooling .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that protons are always heated , although electron drifts can slightly modify the values of the proton heating rate . on the other hand , panels ( b)-(d )",
    "show that an electron population can experience both cooling and heating depending on @xmath50 .",
    "while both core and halo are heated in the absence of bulk drifts , sufficiently large positive @xmath50 lead to core cooling and at the same time significantly enhance halo heating .",
    "negative @xmath50 have the opposite effect on electron heating . in general ,",
    "electron drifts have a larger effect on electron heating than on proton heating .",
    "electron drifts modify the damping rates of kaws by changing the efficiency of wave  particle interactions for the different electron populations .",
    "figure [ fig : energy_partition ] shows how the energy partition depends on electron drifts at @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 vary wildly with @xmath50 . however , since electron drifts affect core heating and halo heating in opposite ways , the total electron heating and consequently the electron - proton energy partition reveal a more moderate dependence on electron drifts . nevertheless , a core drift of @xmath51 increases @xmath63 by @xmath64 . without electron drifts ,",
    "electron heating dominates over proton heating in hydrogen plasmas at @xmath65 for @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : energy_partition ] that positive @xmath50 significantly reduces electron - to - proton heating ratio . at @xmath67 ,",
    "electron heating becomes negligible compared to proton heating .",
    "we note at this point that the dependence of energy partition on electron drifts is qualitatively the same at other wavenumbers , which can be inferred from figure [ fig : p_s vs k ] .",
    "we interpret the dependence of wave damping and particle heating on electron drifts in terms of a simplified resonance analysis .",
    "since @xmath48 is almost independent of electron drifts , the proton heating rate shows only a small variation .",
    "however , core and halo electron bulk drifts significantly change the value and the gradient of the evdf at the resonance speed , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the electron gyro - frequency and @xmath70 is an integer depending on the polarization properties of the wave mode @xcite .    in our case , the most relevant resonance for wave ",
    "particle interactions with kaws is the landau resonance with @xmath71 .",
    "electrons with the ( field - parallel ) speed @xmath72 interact resonantly with the corresponding wave mode .",
    "we illustrate the case for negative @xmath50 schematically in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "the gradient of the distribution functions at the resonance speed determines if the particle species gains or loses energy , i.e. , the signs of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . in the example shown in figure  [ fig :",
    "cartoon ] , the resonance occurs where the halo vdf has a positive gradient , and hence the kaw removes energy from the halo electrons , leading to a negative value for @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , core electrons and protons have resonances where the gradients of their vdfs are negative , leading to positive values for @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , the dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath50 can also be inferred from the positions of the resonance points with respect to the vdfs . however",
    ", a qualitative resonance analysis can not provide a thorough comparison across the plasma components .",
    "we find that @xmath42 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps ] ) , gives a better understanding of the energy transfer between waves and different plasma components .",
    "it is worth noting that electron drifts seem to provide a collisionless energy coupling between core and halo electrons ( see the case with @xmath76 for instance ) .",
    "figure [ fig : panel1](c ) shows that @xmath77 . with @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( from figure [ fig : p_s vs k ] ) , @xmath80 , meaning that energy flows from damped waves and halo electrons into core electrons and protons .",
    "a similar energy transport among electron components was suggested by @xcite . according to this study , the alfvnic heat - flux instability transfers energy from the drifting halo into the electron core through the landau - resonant absorption of the waves , leading to a lower limit for @xmath81 .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we present results for a single propagation angle in this letter .",
    "a careful analysis shows that other oblique angles do not lead to any qualitative differences .",
    "given a fixed kaw power spectrum , we anticipate that the presence of electron drifts changes the wave - energy dissipation rate , particle heating rates , and the proton - electron energy partition ratio significantly .    in the context of the solar wind , since core electrons are nearly always observed to drift sunward in the proton frame , positive ( negative ) @xmath50 correspond to kaws propagating sunward ( anti - sunward )",
    ". therefore , anti - sunward kaws experience stronger damping in the presence of electron drifts and lead to a stronger core heating , halo electron cooling , and a stronger total electron heating .",
    "since the total energy flux typically points anti - sunward in the solar wind , we suggest that electron drifts lead to stronger electron heating than expected from previous calculations @xcite .",
    "an interesting corollary of this work is that , since the core electron drift speed depends on the collisionality of the solar wind @xcite , the heating rate as calculated here may therfore also indirectly depend on solar wind couloumb collisions .",
    "our model includes relative drifts in the electron vdf , while it ignores several additional features of solar wind electrons , namely the presence of superthermal electrons , one - sided beams ( strahl ) and temperature anisotropies . by using a maxwellian halo ,",
    "we ignore high energy tails in the electron vdf .",
    "however , this assumption does not significantly affect the gradients of the electron distribution function at @xmath82 which mainly determine the damping .",
    "we can apply a similar argument to strahl electrons , which also occupy a different region in the velocity space .",
    "regarding temperature anisotropies , @xcite studied the dependence of the core drift threshold for the alfvnic instability on electron temperature anisotropy and found that the dependence is weak in plasmas with @xmath83 .",
    "we expect a similar weak relation in our case , since landau - resonant instabilities show such a weak dependence in general @xcite , since the strength of this type of resonant interaction is determined by the parallel gradients of the electron distribution function .",
    "if the parallel temperature is kept constant , the introduction of temperature anisotropy only changes the perpendicular gradients of the vdf and therefore does not significantly alter the wave  particle interaction .    in this letter",
    ", we choose a fiducial set of representative solar wind plasma parameters to demonstrate the effects of electron drifts on the damping of kaws . in order to fully account for all of the relevant effects in the solar wind",
    ", it is important to conduct a full scan of the corresponding parameter space .",
    "this endeavor is beyond the scope of this work and will be presented in a future paper .",
    "our work shows that , despite our limiting assumption of a superposition of maxwellians to represent the electron distribution function , its fine - structure has a strong influence on the propagation and damping properties of kaws .",
    "therefore , our work is of relevance in the broader context of all collisionless astrophysical plasmas in which non - maxwellian electron distributions can develop and persist . considering that most astrophysical plasmas are in a turbulent state and that kaw - turbulence is believed to be the dominant type of plasma turbulence on small scales , our work suggests that the effects of non - maxwellian electron distributions be carefully accounted for in studies of collisionless astrophysical plasmas in general .",
