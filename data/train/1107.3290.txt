    "the relaxation length of ferromagnets can be determined by angle - resolved photoemission@xcite , while the conductance polarization of ferromagnets can be investigated by measuring the doppler shift of spin - waves@xcite .",
    "while the model typically works well for pillar structures with clean interfaces@xcite , in lateral systems the model generally overestimates the observable spin - valve signals@xcite .",
    "this is because it is often necessary to perform ion - milling prior to deposition to obtain ohmic interfaces .",
    "this is taken into account in the modeling by using a reduced conductance polarization of the ferromagnet p@xmath47 .",

    "an example of the application of this model can be found in bakker@xcite .",

    "a threshold exists for this process given in terms of the charge current which should be sent through the device .    a model of this device geometry with resulting spin voltage",

    "considering the empirical spread found for spin valve signals , this is very reasonable .",
    "because the electrical current density spread throughout the device is modeled , the biot - savart law also allows to calculate the magnetic fields present in the device .",
    "the magnetic fields at position @xmath55 is determined by performing a volume integral over the entire device :    @xmath56    here @xmath57 is the magnetic vacuum permeability .",
    "we find that the magnetic field at the center of the switchable ferromagnet is @xmath58 = 1.2 mt at the maximum applied charge current of 5 ma while the switching field of the magnet is 8 mt .",
    "this directly rules out that the magnetization switches by the induced magnetic fields , but it can be responsible for observed asymmetries in the spin - transfer torque switching process .      spin - orbit effects in ferromagnets are often sizeable due to their complex band alignment . as a result ,",
    "measurements on spin - orbit effects in ferromagnets were already reported more then a century ago .",
    "first dyakanov and perel@xcite and later hirsch@xcite suggested that the same process which governed these effects in ferromagnets , whether it be due to band alignment ( intrinsic ) or spin - dependent scattering ( extrinsic ) , can also be responsible for a new effect in paramagnetic materials : the spin - hall effect@xcite .",
    "the direct spin - hall effect describes that when a charge current @xmath14 is sent through a material with strong spin - orbit interaction , a spin current @xmath59 flows away from the center of the conductor with its spin direction @xmath60 , a unity vector , perpendicular to the charge and spin current . in the indirect version ,",
    "a spin current flowing through the material creates a voltage perpendicular to the spin and spin current direction .",
    "based on a boltzmann transport theory derived by zhang@xcite , the effects are governed by the following two equations :    @xmath61     ( color online ) calculated spin voltages v@xmath54 ( @xmath52v ) for the device of kimura@xcite et al .",

    "the charge current i@xmath42 = 50 @xmath52a is short - circuited by the copper strip which is why most spin accumulation enters through the corners .",
    "when the spin voltage enters the copper strip it is only a small fraction of the @xmath62v spin voltage present in the bulk platinum .",
    "the voltage v@xmath40 is now measured by converting the spin voltage v@xmath54 to a charge voltage at the fm / nm interface.,width=332 ]    here @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the bulk charge and spin voltages resulting from the direct and indirect spin - hall effect and @xmath65 is the spin - hall angle , typically a small fraction of one .",
    "both effects can be included into the 2-channel model . to do this , we rewrite both equations into spin - up and spin - down currents and obtain the new spin - dependent conductance matrix :    @xmath66    where non - diagonal elements @xmath67 are included .",
    "these become skew - symmetric matrices determined by the spin - direction @xmath60 considered in the device :    @xmath68    here ( i , j , k ) are the indices of the predefined xyz axes and @xmath69 is the cevi - levita symbol .    to demonstrate the theory , we model a device measured by kimura@xcite et al . where both the direct and indirect spin - hall effect were measured in a single nanoscale device at room temperature for the first time .",
    "the results from this model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2:2 ] .",
    "the device consists of a single permalloy ferromagnet which is connected to a 4 nm thin platinum strip by a copper cross .",
    "a pure spin current can be injected into the platinum strip by sending a charge current i@xmath40 from the ferromagnet to one of the arms of the copper cross . when the magnetization of the ferromagnet is aligned in the @xmath70y - direction , the spin current flowing into the platinum in the -z direction",
    "creates a voltage due to the indirect spin - hall effect in the x - direction .",
    "this voltage can be measured between the two contacts present on the platinum strip . in the same device , sending a charge current through the platinum strip creates a spin current flowing in the z - direction where the spins are aligned in the @xmath70y - direction , which is now due to the direct spin - hall effect .",
    "when this spin current arrives at the permalloy strip , it is converted into a voltage which can be electrically measured .",
    "both the direct and indirect spin - hall signal in this device is around 60 @xmath71 at room temperature at a distance of 400 nm from platinum strip to ferromagnet . using the common parameters p@xmath72=0.3 , @xmath73 = 5 nm , @xmath74 = 2 nm and @xmath51 = 350 nm@xcite and the measured conductivities",
    ", we find that a spin - hall angle of @xmath65 = 5@xmath75 accurately produces both signals .",
    "this angle is around 8 times smaller then previously deduced .",
    "the difference lies somewhat in the used parameters , which are different , but mostly in the modeling which takes into account effects which the resistor model does not .",
    "for example , when a charge current is sent through the contacts connected to the platinum strip , the charge current mostly goes through the copper on top of the platinum strip instead of the platinum strip itself , which is due to the high conductivity of the copper .",
    "copper is expected to have virtually no spin - hall effect which reduced the observed voltage .",
    "we calculate that only 1% of the charge current goes fully through the platinum strip .",
    "a similar effect also occurs for the indirect spin - hall effect .",
    "when a spin current is injected into the platinum strip , the produced voltage is also short - circuited by the copper strip .",
    "this example clearly demonstrates the need for a three - dimensional model to accurately predict the relevant parameters .",
    "ferromagnetism of typical ( metallic ) ferromagnets used in spintronic experiments originates from the electronic band structure .",
    "this band structure varies more strongly than those of the non - magnetic parts due to ferromagnetically induced shifts in the s- and d - bands .",
    "the mott - formula@xcite describes that thermoelectricity is strongest when the electrical conductivity varies strongly around the fermi energy . since this variation is dependent on the band structure , the ferromagnets used in spintronic experiments are good thermoelectric materials@xcite .",
    "a model of thermoelectricity is therefore highly required to explain the voltages observed in nanoscale devices@xcite and can also be used to demonstrate new physics@xcite .",

    "the transport is then determined by the conductance matrix :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath82 the seebeck coefficient and @xmath83 the peltier coefficient .",
    "the peltier coefficient is related to the seebeck coefficient by the thermodynamic thomson - kelvin relation @xmath84 , where t is the reference temperature .",
    "the seebeck coefficient governs the seebeck effect : the generation of a voltage as a result of a temperature gradient .",
    "the peltier coefficient describes the transport of energy when a charge current is sent through a material .    in the model ,",
    "the charge current remains conserved .",
    "however , the heat current is not .",
    "when a charge current is sent through a material , the inelastic scattering of electrons causes a rise in temperature .",
    "this is a process known as joule heating .",
    "conservation of the currents gives the source term : @xmath85 .",
    "unlike electrical transport , which is only carried by ( missing ) electrons , thermal conductivity typically has two contributions : that from the energy transported by electrons and from lattice vibrations : phonons . in metals , the transport by electrons often dominates . in this case , the wiedemann - franz law @xmath86 , which relates thermal and electrical conductivity through the lorenz number @xmath87 , can be used to estimate thermal conductivities from measured electrical conductivities .",
    "this model has recently been demonstrated in nanoscale spintronic devices@xcite .",
    "these experiments illustrate that the ferromagnetic / non - magnetic junction used acts as a thermocouple to measure the local temperature of the device . in addition , when a charge current is sent through such a junction it heats or refrigerates the device due to the peltier effect . in the non - local spin valve geometry , the interplay between both effects leads to a baseline resistance @xmath88 which is purely thermoelectric in nature .",
    "the inclusion of joule heating makes heat transport , and therefore also charge transport , nonlinear .",
    "this results in nonlinear voltage signals .",
    "while the linear response r@xmath38 is often resulting from conventional ohmic paths@xcite , the higher harmonic response are the result of thermoelectric effects .",
    "for example , the @xmath89 response can result from joule heating of devices measured by a ferromagnet / non - magnetic thermocouple .",
    "if the typical bulk thermal dependencies @xmath90 of the seebeck coefficient s(t)=@xmath91 and conductivity @xmath92 are used in the model , it is possible to explain even higher order nonlinearities observed in experiment@xcite .      whenever magnetic fields are applied or magnetism is involved in experiments , a large variety of spin - orbit effects may occur .",
    "these effects break the symmetry of the thermoelectric model .",
    "the most notable of these is the hall effect which describes the generation of a voltage perpendicular to the plane made by an applied charge current and magnetic field .",
    "the observed transverse voltages generated in a ferromagnet are typically larger than expected from the ordinary hall effect resulting from internal magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , in ferromagnets , it is named the anomalous - hall effect .",
    "the exact origin of this effect has been under continuous debate for over a century and seems to depend on the specific conditions of the experiment@xcite .",
    "the equation which describes the anomalous - hall effect is obtained from boltzmann transport theory@xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the contribution to the current due to the anomalous - hall effect .",
    "it is incorporated in the model using a skew symmetric conductivity :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the anomalous - hall angle .",
    "such contributions are often called spurious in spintronic devices since they can mimic spin valve signals@xcite .",
    "however they can be modeled in spintronic devices to calculate their magnitude .",
    "the seebeck , peltier and thermal conductivity coefficients have similar spin - orbit contributions .",

    "the contribution to the peltier effect is named the anomalous - ettinghausen effect while the contribution to the thermal conductivity is named the anomalous righi - leduc effect .",
    "in addition , spin - orbit effects also determine that the conductivity of a ferromagnet is different by measuring it parallel or perpendicular to the magnetization of the ferromagnet .",
    "this is the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect and can be included in the model by adding an anisotropic contribution to the conductivity . the symmetric contribution then becomes@xcite :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the kronecker delta and r@xmath99 the coefficient governing anisotropic magnetoresistance , typically a few percent@xcite . by symmetry ,",
    "we expect equivalent anisotropic contributions to the seebeck , peltier and thermal conductivity .",
