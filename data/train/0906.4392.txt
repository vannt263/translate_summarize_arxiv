    "high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in x - ray binary systems have been observed for a number of years and may provide an important tool for studying the strong gravitational fields of black holes ( see remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "however , the physical mechanisms that generate such x - ray variability remain unclear .",
    "one of the most appealing models for the source of qpos is the relativistic diskoseismic oscillation model , where general relativistic effects produce trapped oscillation modes at the inner region of an accretion disc ( e.g. , kato & fukue 1980 ; okazaki et al .",

    ", we studied the global corotational instability of non - axisymmetric p - modes ( also called intertial - acoustic modes ) trapped in the inner - most region of the accretion disc around a black hole .",
    "these modes do not have nodes in the vertical direction , and were shown to be amplified by the effect of wave absorption at corotation resonance . near the black hole the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath9 reaches a maximum and goes to zero at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "this causes a non - monotonic behavior in the fluid vortensity , @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 inside the radius where @xmath12 peaks .",
    "it can be shown that the sign of the corotational wave absorption depends on the sign of the vortensity gradient @xmath13 ( tsang & lai 2008 ; see goldreich & tremaine 1979 ) .",
    "thus p - modes with positive vortensity gradient at the corotation radius can be overstable due to corotational wave absorption .",
    "tagger & pellat ( 2002 ) and tagger & varniere ( 2006 ) showed that the global p - mode intability can be enhanced when the disc is threaded by a strong ( of order equipartion ) , large - scale poloidal magnetic field .",
    "our previous study ( lai & tsang 2009 ) and much of the related work on disc dynamics have assumed barotropic flows for the disc ( i.e. the pressure depends only on density ) .",
    "this assumption provides convenient simplification , but may miss important effects of the disc dynamics .",
    "for example , lovelace et al . ( 1999 ) and li et al . ( 2000 ) studied the adiabatic perturbations for waves trapped by a disk entropy radial profile that has a localized maximum , leading to the so - called rossby - wave instability .",
    "they showed that in such a case the key parameter determining the effect of the corotation is no longer the gradient of the vortensity , but rather the slope of a modified effective vortensity , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is defined as the entropy and @xmath3 is the 2-dimensional adiabatic index ( assumed to be constant ) .",
    "as another example , baruteau & masset ( 2008 ) showed that the corotation torque of a protoplanetary disc on a planet can be significantly different for barotropic and non - barotropic fluids .",
    "in this paper we study the global corotational instability of p - modes in accretion discs around black holes , generalizing our pevious works ( tsang & lai 2008 ; lai & tsang 2009 ) to include non - barotropic effects . in section 2",
    "we develop the basic equations of adiabatic perturbations for generic accretion discs . in section 3",
    "we analyze the effect of the corotation resonance , including a careful treatment of both the first and second - order singularities of the resonance ; we derive a wkb expression for the reflectivity due to the corotation barrier and show that super - reflection can be achieved under certain conditions . in section 4",
    "we consider black hole disc models parametrized by @xmath2-viscosity , and calculate the global disc p - mode frequencies and growth rates .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss the implications of this work for models of high - frequency qpos .",
    "we begin by considering the basic fluid equations of a 2-dimensional disc .",

    "the growth rates for these modes are significantly higher than for the corresponding barotropic case ( see lai & tsang 2009 ) , due to the effect of the entropy in the effective vortensity . although higher-@xmath241 modes may grow slightly faster , they would be less likely to be observed due to averaging out of the luminosity variation over the observable emitting area . the @xmath242 mode is found to have a significantly smaller growth rate than the @xmath243 modes .    for our simple @xmath2-disc models ,",

    "2008 , tomsick et al .",
    "2009 ) would be useful to determine this trend and to search for the possible @xmath244 mode and the frequency ratios .",
    "finally , it should be noted that our calculations of global disc modes are still based on rather crude models .",
    "the @xmath2-discs are phenomenological models , and our results ( especially the mode growth rates ) depend sensitively on the inner disc boundary conditions ( both the @xmath245 parameter for the background disc and the reflecting boundary condition for the waves )",

    "thus we should treat our specific results ( such as those presented in table 1 ) only as a demonstration of the basic physical principles , and any comparison with the observations at this point should be taken in this spirit .",
