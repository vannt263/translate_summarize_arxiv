    "the mass ( and its time derivative ) and spin ( and its time derivative ) of bhs are crucial for understanding the agn phenomena ; most models and simulations suggest that it is the mass accretion and/or spin of black holes that produce the jets of agn , e.g. see @xcite model for the bh spin induced jet , @xcite model for the disc accretion induced jet , and see recent reviews for the simulations of accretion disc @xcite and for hot accretion flows @xcite . the co - evolution of central bh and its host agn makes it possible for measuring the bh mass via various ways , and the mass accretion rate can be estimated through the measurements of eddington ratio . while bh spins are still difficult to measure , although there is an explosion of bh spin measurements in recent years , only some 19 agn may have bh spin measurements @xcite .",

    "cold accretion flow consists of optically thick and geometrically thin gas , e.g. the standard thin disc @xcite , which occurs at a fraction of the eddington mass accretion rate , and the slim disc at super - eddington rates @xcite .",
    "hot accretion flows , however , are virially hot and optically thin , they occur at lower mass accretion rates , and are described by models such as the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf , @xcite ) and luminous hot accretion flow .",

    "find that the anti - correlation of radio loudness and disc luminosity could be explained with the @xmath81 in the bh spin paradigm , implying that the bh spin plays an important role in the jet powers .",
    "therefore the seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies in our samples are likely powered by both the inner part of accretion disc and the bh spin . if the bz - jet power is gradually suppressed when the accretion rate increases , the jet power could be less proportional to the disc luminosity and this may lead to an anti - correlation of radio loudness and disc luminosity .",
    "this is some similar to the transition from hard / low ( with low accretion rate and radio jet ) to soft / high ( with high accretion rate and no jet ) state in the x - ray binaries , in which a contribution of jet power from black hole spin is possible @xcite .",
    "however , this explanation needs a high fraction of rapid spin bhs in the low - z agn .",
    "@xcite analyzed the ratio of jet power to disc luminosity , they find that at z@xmath280.5 the low - excitation galaxies have low accretion rates and bimodal spin distributions , with approximately half of the population having maximal spins , while high exciting galaxies are explained as high - accretion rate but very low spin objects at higher redshifts ( z@xmath551 ) and only a small population of nearly maximally spinning high accretion rate objects is possible .",
    "this may be supported by the findings that much higher fraction of radio loud galaxies at low accretion rates @xcite than the fraction ( @xmath5510% ) of radio loud quasars at higher redshifts @xcite . and it has been suggested that low redshift fris have rapid spinning bhs @xcite .    in high - z quasars , a steep slope @xmath99 or @xmath1001 between jet power and disc luminosity is often observed , e.g , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the quasars are at high accretion state ( @xmath101 ) and hosted by elliptical galaxies .",
    "the massive ellipticals are most likely formed via major merger events , and their nuclei may have different nuclear environments than disc galaxies .",
    "@xcite find evidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radio luminosity of agn at around z=1 .",
    "the jets of frii quasars are probably launched through the bondi accretion of hot interstellar gas @xcite , with efficient jet powers @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a tight positive correlation between the bondi accretion rate and the radio power required to inflate cavities observed in the surrounding x - ray emitting gas , suggests that the bondi formulae provide a reasonable description of the accretion process for powerful jets .",
    "furthermore , the powerful jet may live in a short time for quasars , given that the majority of quasars are radio quiet .",
    "@xcite proposed a hybrid model combined both the disc accretion and the bh spin / magnetosphere effects , it can produce powerful jets if the bh spin @xmath102 ( @xmath103 is dimensionless spin parameter ranging from 0 - 1 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , both the hybrid model and the magnetically arrested disc @xcite needs maximally spinning bhs for producing frii jets , it is suggested that only a small population of nearly maximally spinning bhs in high accretion rate objects , and spins of bhs are generally low at around z=1 @xcite . as noted by @xcite , the powerful jets of frii quasars are mainly controlled by the inner part of accretion flows rather than by the power extracted from the bh spin ( also see @xcite ) , in contrast to that the bz - jet may control the negative correlation of radio loudness and disc luminosity in the low luminosity agn as we discussed above .    @xcite find from a radio selected sample of 27 radio galaxies at a narrow redshift range z=0.9 - 1.1 that is unbiased to evolutionary effects , that there is a tight positive correlation between the radio luminosity and the mid - ir ( also the @xmath86 $ ] ) line luminosity with power law indices @xmath94 .",
    "they added optical selected quasars ( osqs ) into the analysis , the correlation for the brightest radio sources appears to become an upper envelope .",
    "however , @xcite investigated both radio loud and quiet quasars at z @xmath28 1.6 drawn from the sdss quasar sample .",

    "this sample is much larger than the @xcite sample , so it could be statistically more significant .",
    "our studies concentrate mainly on radio loud sources , and it is needed to include radio quiet ones in larger and complete samples into analysis in future",

    "the doppler boosting effect is not considered here , since our samples are mainly the fris , friis and seyfert galaxies , and the blazars are not included .",

    "in fact , the correlation is stronger between the radio power and the disc luminosity than that between the radio ( or disc ) luminosity and redshift in the radio galaxies of our samples , these type of source are mainly studied in this paper , but the malmquist bias might still have some effects which we were currently not able to remove from our data . as analyzed by @xcite ,",
    "a flux limited sample with a wide range of radio luminosities within narrow redshift ranges ( and vice versa ) will be needed to disentangle the effects in future .",

    "this leads to a negative correlation between radio loudness and @xmath5 for the low luminosity agn , i.e. @xmath105 with @xmath7 , which may be attributed to a contribution of bz - jet to total jet power assuming that the bz - jet power is gradually suppressed as the accretion rate increases .    on the contrary , for the high - z quasars which often show the slope @xmath8 , a positive correlation between the radio loudness and disc luminosity",

    "<S> a model for the relation between radio jet power and the product of central black hole ( bh ) mass and eddington ratio of agn is proposed , and the model is examined with data from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that radio jet power positively correlates but not linearly with the product of bh mass ( @xmath0 in solar mass ) and eddington ratio ( @xmath1 ) , and the power law indices ( @xmath2 ) are significantly less than unity for relatively low accretion ( @xmath3 ) agn , @xmath4 , in the radio galaxies and the seyfert galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a negative correlation between radio loudness and @xmath5 for the low luminosity agn , i.e. @xmath6 with @xmath7 , which may be attributed to a contribution of bh spin to total jet power assuming that the spin induced jet is gradually suppressed as the accretion rate increases . </S>",
    "<S> whereas , for the high - z quasars which often show the slope @xmath8 , a positive correlation between the radio loudness and disc luminosity is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss that the jet powers of the high - z frii quasars are likely dominated by the accretion disc rather than by the bh spin . </S>"
