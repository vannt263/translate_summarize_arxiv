    "optical surveys have measured the evolution of qsos out to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the most dramatic feature found is the rise and fall of the co - moving space density with peak activity at @xmath14 .",
    "a systematic decrease in luminosity from @xmath15 to the present is evident with very few intrinsically bright qsos in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this fading of the qso population is attributed to a decreased fuel supply and/or fueling rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dropoff in the space density at @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) could represent the growth phase of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , possibly under a veil of obscuration @xcite .",
    "it has become clear in the past decade that x - ray selection of agn offers many benefits over detection methods in other wavebands .",
    "x - rays can penetrate large absorbing columns of gas which can effectively hide an accreting black hole in the optical . the existence of a significant , missed population of obscured agn is required to explain the spectral shape of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxrb",
    "; e.g. , @xcite ) . the current generation of x - ray observatories ( _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ )",
    "are probing the faint source population responsible for the bulk of the cxrb ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray surveys with _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and @xmath16 are refining our knowledge of the agn x - ray luminosity function .",
    "the peak , in the co - moving space density of low luminosity ( @xmath17 erg s@xmath5 ) agn found in hard ( 210 kev ) x - ray surveys ( @xcite ) , occurs at @xmath18 .",
    "this contrasts starkly with the behavior of the luminous ( @xmath19 erg s@xmath5 ) qsos which are most prevalent at @xmath14 . using a highly complete sample of 941 agn selected in the soft band , @xcite",
    "show the same luminosity dependence and extend the space density measurement of low luminosity agn ( @xmath20 erg s@xmath5 ) out to @xmath0 .",
    "these latest results clearly require a luminosity dependent density evolution model @xcite in contrast to a pure luminosity evolution model , descriptive of optically selected qsos @xcite . with these results ,",
    "semi - analytic models @xcite posit that the more luminous qsos illuminate early epochs when most of the massive galaxies are forming ( @xmath21 ) , thereby inducing high accretion rates , whereas lower luminosity agn dominate at a later period ( @xmath22 ) when most of the galaxies have fully assembled .",
    "x - ray selected qsos from _ rosat _ have hinted at a constant space density between @xmath23 @xcite for the most luminous agn ( log @xmath24 ) .",
    "the lack of a decline in the space density at @xmath7 , in contrast to the behavior seen in optical surveys , could be evidence for obscuration at early epochs .",
    "we can test this model ( fabian 1999 ) by measuring the luminosity function and co - moving space density of x - ray - selected agn over a wide area to compile a significant sample at @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , the _ rosat _ sample includes only 7 qsos at these high redshifts . of these ,",
    "only 5 qsos have luminosities high enough to be detected over a broad range of redshift ( @xmath25 ) and thereby included in the measurement of the co - moving space density @xcite . while the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ deep field observations have great scientific merit , their narrow area provides only 4 high luminosity ( log @xmath26 ) agn at @xmath7 .",
    "recent measurement of the hard x - ray luminosity function ( @xcite ) have limited numbers of agn at these high redshifts .",
    "a wider area survey is needed to compile a significant sample of highly luminous qsos with redshifts greater than 3 .",
    "we present a preliminary measure of the co - moving space density of x - ray selected agn out to @xmath27 from the _ chandra _ multiwavelength project ( champ ) .",
    "we supplement the champ sample with agn of comparable x - ray and optical fluxes from the _ chandra _ deep field north ( cdf - n ) and south ( cdf - s ) to boost our spectroscopic completeness at faint optical magnitudes and include one additional @xmath7 qso .",
    "we merge the subsample of these agn detected in the soft ( 0.52.0 kev ) band with those from _",
    "rosat _ to directly compare with miyaji et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "a full presentation of the champ x - ray luminosity function is forthcoming ( silverman et al . 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "we assume h@xmath28 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 with the exception of section  [ sxlf ] .",
    "the champ ( @xcite ) is carrying out an extragalactic x - ray survey encompassing 10 deg@xmath2 using serendipitous detections in archival _ chandra _ fields .",
    "@xmath31 small point spread function ( @xmath32 resolution on - axis ) and low background allow sources to be detected to fainter flux levels ( @xmath33 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) than any x - ray observatory past or present , thus enabling the detection of high redshift ( @xmath34 ) agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the present study , we use the full _ chandra _ energy range ( 0.38.0 kev ) to detect the absorbed sources missed by previous optical , uv or soft x - ray surveys and take advantage of the high collecting area at soft energies to detect the faint , high redshift agn . at @xmath7 , we are sensitive to agn with absorbing columns up to @xmath35 @xmath4 due to the favorable @xmath36-correction . with a sample of agn selected from a large number of non - contiguous _ chandra _ fields that reach similar depths ( @xmath33 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) , we effectively smooth out any effects from large scale structures such as those evident in the cdf - s @xcite .",
    "we have chosen 23 _ chandra _ fields ( 1.8 deg@xmath2 ) for which we have acquired extensive followup optical imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "the deepest observations have exposure times that are sensitive to sources with @xmath37 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "a full description of the champ image reduction and analysis pipeline xpipe can be found in @xcite . with our 4 m mosaic optical imaging ,",
    "we are able to identify counterparts to the _ chandra _ sources down to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we acquire optical imaging in three ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filters @xcite .",
    "optical colors provide preliminary source classification and crude photometric redshifts .",
    "these diagnostics are required to characterize the optically faint x - ray sources that can not be identified with spectroscopy and in particular , their influence on the x - ray luminosity function .",
    "the use of the sdss photometric system allows more direct comparison between the champ and the sdss agn surveys @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopic followup currently focuses on identifying counterparts with @xmath6 for which spectra can be acquired on a 4 - 6 m ( i.e. mmt , magellan , wiyn , ctio blanco ) class telescope . to date , we have spectroscopically classified a sample of 358 agn detected in the broad band ( 0.38.0 kev ) in these 23 champ fields .",
    "there are complications with measuring the x - ray luminosity function that must be put into context . the difficulty in focusing x - rays results in a point source function ( psf ) and flux sensitivity that varies across the field of view .",
    "the psf degrades as a function of off - axis angle , decreasing the flux sensitivity . in terms of measuring the luminosity function ,",
    "it is not a trivial task to determine the incompleteness at the faintest x - ray fluxes and the actual sky area over which a source of a specific flux would be detected .",
    "in addition , the exposure times of these chandra fields range from 17 to 114 ksec generating a wide range of limiting fluxes even on - axis .    to characterize the sensitivity , completeness , and sky area coverage as a function of x - ray flux",
    ", a series of simulations were performed .",
    "the full details will be presented in an upcoming champ x - ray analysis paper ( m. kim , d .-",
    "w kim et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the simulations consists of three parts , 1 ) generating artificial x - ray sources with marx ( marx technical manual ) and adding them to real x - ray images , 2 ) detecting these artificial sources by wavdetect and extracting source properties with xpipe identically as performed for actual sources , and 3 ) estimating the sky area coverage by comparing the input and detected source properties as a function of flux .",
    "the simulations are restricted to specific ccds for acis - i ( i0 , i1 , i2 , and i3 ) and acis - s ( i2 , i3 , s2 , and s3 ) .",
    "these ccds are closest to the aimpoint for each observation .",
    "sources far off - axis ( @xmath41 ) are excluded since the flux sensitivity is low and the psf is degraded .",
    "these simulations allow determination of corrections for the source detection incompleteness at faint flux levels quantified in the first champ x - ray analysis paper @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : area ] , we show the sky coverage determined from the simulations using the broad ( 0.38.0 kev ) and soft ( 0.52.0 kev ) band source detections for 23 champ fields .",
    "we are surveying a sky area of 1.8 deg@xmath2 for the brightest sources .",
    "the sky area falls below 0.1 deg@xmath2 at the faintest flux levels .",
    "in these champ fields , we find a diversity of objects ( agn , clusters , galaxies , and stars ) , although 85% of them are attributed to an agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "we show the optical magnitude ( @xmath42 ) as a function of 0.38.0 kev x - ray flux for the sources detected in 23 champ fields ( figure  [ xo : fig ] ) .",
    "we only include sources with greater than 9.5 net counts .",
    "although sources with counts as low as 2 may be significant detections as a result of _ chandra _ s low background , we use a higher count limit to ensure that we have well - measured x - ray fluxes within our sample . in figure",
    "[ xo : fig ] we label sources as classified from our optical spectroscopy .",
    "extragalactic objects with strong emission lines ( w@xmath43 @xmath44 ) are labelled as either broad line agn ( blagn ; fwhm @xmath45 1000 km s@xmath5 ) or narrow emission line galaxy ( nelg ; fwhm @xmath46 1000 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the blagn are equivalent to type 1 agn .",
    "we loosely refer to the nelg with @xmath47 erg s@xmath5 as type 2 agn since optical spectra may not cover all the emission lines needed to confirm photoionization from a non - thermal source .",
    "extragalactic counter - parts with weak emission line ( w@xmath48 @xmath44 ) or pure absorption line spectra are classified as absorption line galaxy ( alg ) .",
    "in addition , a handful of stars are identified at faint x - ray fluxes .",
    "six clusters have been found based primarily on their extended x - ray emission .",
    "we calculate the rest frame ( 0.38.0 kev ; erg s@xmath5 ) x - ray luminosity for each extragalactic source , after correction for galactic absorption . the conversion from x - ray count rate to flux units ( erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 )",
    "is determined from simulated detections on each ccd of a source with a powerlaw spectrum and @xmath49 .",
    "we chose the former since the photon index more closely resembles the majority of the x - ray source detections with spectroscopic identification . ]",
    "( @xmath50;@xmath51 ) and galactic absorption @xcite .",
    "the observed luminosity is converted to the rest frame assuming a powerlaw spectrum with the photon index ( @xmath52 ) set to the average value for that object type ( blagn , nelg , alg ) based upon our x - ray spectral fit results ( aldcroft et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "we find that the blagn have a mean spectral index ( @xmath53 ) of 1.9 while the nelg have @xmath53=0.9 and alg have flatter slopes @xmath53=1.5 .",
    "we do not apply a correction for intrinsic absorption due to the uncertainty in the absorbing columns for most of these agn as a result of their low x - ray counts .    to construct a pure agn sample",
    ", we require the derived ( rest frame 0.38.0  kev ) luminosity to exceed 10@xmath54 erg s@xmath5 thereby excluding any sources that contain a significant stellar or hot ism component .",
    "as shown in figure  [ champ_lz ] , we see that 92% of the extragalactic sources in the champ not associated with an extended x - ray emitting cluster satisfy this criterion .",
    "we currently have not identified any nelg and alg above a redshift of 1 in the champ .",
    "our optical spectroscopic limit ( @xmath55 ) precludes classification of objects with heavy optical extinction beyond this redshift , since a @xmath56 elliptical host galaxy has @xmath57 at @xmath18 .",
    "we detect many optical type 2 agn with @xmath58 erg s@xmath5 but no luminous ( @xmath59 erg s@xmath5 ) optical type 2 qsos .",
    "we do find 6% of the blagn to be x - ray absorbed with a substantial fraction having reddened optical colors which may prevent them from being selected in optical surveys @xcite .",
    "these red blagn may be similar to those found by the two micron all sky survey @xcite that tend to have significant x - ray absorbing columns of gas @xcite .",
    "deep optical followup of a broadband x - ray - selected sample will help determine the fraction of such red quasars to the space density of x - ray luminous agn .",
    "we have supplemented our champ sample with x - ray sources from the cdf - n @xcite and cdf - s @xcite with x - ray fluxes above our chosen limit ( see below ; @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) . these samples allow us to boost the number of spectroscopically identified sources at faint optical magnitudes ( @xmath60 ) and include any additional @xmath7 agn . these are currently the only surveys with published optical spectroscopic identifications at moderate completeness levels for sources with flux levels comparable to the champ . in figure  [ xodistr ] @xmath61 , we plot the flux distribution of x - ray sources found in these 25 _ chandra _ fields .",
    "the cdf - n and cdf - s clearly contribute most of the faint sources ( log @xmath62 ) . in figure  [ xodistr ] @xmath63",
    ", we show the optical magnitude distribution of counterparts to sources with x - ray fluxes above our chosen limit and those with optical spectroscopic identifications .",
    "optical magnitudes for the cdf n+s sources were converted from the johnson ( b , r ) to the sdss photometric system using the transformation in @xcite . by including these two deep chandra fields , our area coverage is larger than that shown in figure  [ fig : area ] .",
    "we add a fixed area of 0.22 deg@xmath64 since the area coverage in these two fields does not change above this bright flux limit by more than 3% .",
    "to evaluate the status of our optical followup and determine effective survey limits , we measure the fraction of x - ray sources identified with optical spectroscopic observations as a function of x - ray flux and optical magnitude .",
    "since the x - ray sources do not fully sample the @xmath65 plane ( figure  [ xo : fig ] ) , we have implemented an adaptive binning scheme identical to that of @xcite to generate a completeness map as a function of x - ray and optical flux for the combined sample ( champ + cdf - n + cdf - s ) .",
    "we create an array with 64@xmath6664 elements covering the @xmath65 plane ( figure  [ xo : fig ] ) .",
    "the identified fraction @xmath67 is measured at each element as the number of identified objects divided by the number of x - ray sources .",
    "if 10 or more x - ray sources are in a single element , then we assign @xmath68 as the completeness level .",
    "we then increase the bin size by a factor of two .",
    "if the binned element has 10 or more objects , the individual elements not previously assigned an identified fraction are set to this value .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the final binned element equals the size of the full array . in figure",
    "[ xo : adapt ] , we plot the final array ( i.e. completeness map ) as a grey scale image .    based on figure  [ xo :",
    "adapt ] , we set the flux limits of our agn sample .",
    "we choose a single x - ray flux limit at @xmath69 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 that is brighter than the faintest x - ray detections in the champ .",
    "this limit ensures that we minimize the bias towards optically bright agn at the faintest x - ray flux limits . in order to limit our completeness correction to @xmath70",
    ", we set an optical magnitude limit at a level where at least 30% of the sources are identified , this leads to a magnitude limit of 22.5 . with the remaining sample ,",
    "the incompleteness level is used to correct the measurement of the space density ( section  [ xlf ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ xo : adapt ] , we plot the location of agn , including those from the _ chandra _ deep fields in the @xmath65 plane . since a significant number of agn fall in regions of low completeness at faint fluxes , we must exclude 8 of the 22 agn with @xmath7 and log @xmath71 ( circled points ) .",
    "in particular , the highest redshift agn ( cxomp j213945.0 - 234655 ; @xmath72 ; @xcite ) found by the champ has been excluded not because of its x - ray flux ( @xmath73 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ) but rather due to its optical magnitude ( @xmath74 ) which falls below our limit .",
    "we do have a significant sample of 368 agn above our flux limits with 14 ( 13 from champ ) at @xmath7 , almost a factor of three larger than the high redshift sample available from _ rosat_. in figure  [ lzdistr ] , we plot the @xmath75 distribution of the total sample of 368 agn selected in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev band .",
    "we implement the 1/v@xmath76 method @xcite to generate an estimate to the co - moving space density ( @xmath77 in units of mpc@xmath78 ; equation  [ eq : va ] ) in fixed redshift and luminosity intervals . for each @xmath79 bin ,",

    "the solid angle ( d@xmath88 ) is a function of x - ray flux as shown in figure  [ fig : area ] plus an additional 0.22 deg@xmath64 contributed by the chandra deep fields observations .",
    "a correction factor ( @xmath67 ) , determined from the location of an individual agn in the @xmath65 plane ( figure  [ xo : adapt ] ) , compensates for the incompleteness in our spectroscopic identifications as detailed in the previous section .",
    "each agn contributes ( @xmath67@xmath81)@xmath5 to the space density in a specific luminosity and redshift interval .",
    "we estimate 1@xmath89 errors based on a poisson distribution due to the small number of objects per redshift bin . while there are known biases inherent in the 1/v@xmath76 method ( e.g. @xcite ) , the overall evolutionary trends can be discerned ( e.g. @xcite ) . a detailed x - ray luminosity function , will be presented in a future publication ( silverman et al .  in preparation ) , while implementing more sophisticated analysis techniques ( e.g. maximum likelihood method ) .",
    "we measure the co - moving space density ( equation  [ eq : va ] ) of agn detected in the broad band from 25 _ chandra _ fields . in figure",

    "we must keep in mind that we are limited to the detection of obscured agn ( type 2 ) at luminosities below @xmath94 erg s@xmath5 and redshifts below 1 due to our optical spectroscopic limit as shown in figure  [ champ_lz ] . as a result , the highest luminosity range ( @xmath95 ) is restricted to type 1 agn only . to account for the optically faint ( @xmath10 ) , spectroscopically unidentified x - ray sources , we remove the optical flux limit and implement the method of @xcite and @xcite to measure upper limits to the space density .",
    "we have assigned all unidentified sources to each feasible @xmath79 bin with the redshift and luminosity set to the mean value . with this method",
    ", a specific source usually falls within multiple @xmath79 bins .    at @xmath11 , the low luminosity ( log  @xmath12 ) agn are more than an order of magnitude more numerous than those with high luminosity , thus confirming recent results @xcite .",
    "this is evident even when considering the unidentified population since the upper limit to the space density of luminous agn ( log  @xmath96 ) at @xmath11 is fairly constrained . from figure  [ champ_lz ] , we see that most of the sources contributing to the space density at @xmath11 are non - blagn .",
    "these results agree with those reported by @xcite that show type 2 agn as the dominant population at @xmath97 .",
    "the peak values of the two lower luminosity curves ( @xmath98 mpc@xmath78 ) agree with those from the soft ( 0.52.0 kev ) x - ray luminosity function @xcite .",
    "we find the space density a factor of @xmath993 less , for agn with @xmath100 at @xmath101 , than the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray survey results of @xcite .",
    "these comparisons seem reasonable since our broad band ( 0.3 - 8.0 kev ) selected sample will be affected by absorption as known to occur in samples selected in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) .    for the luminous agn ( log  @xmath102 44.5 ) , we measure a rise and fall of the number density with a peak at @xmath14 . with 14 agn in the high redshift bin ( @xmath103 )",
