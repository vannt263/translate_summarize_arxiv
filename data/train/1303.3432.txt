    "cellular automata  discrete models that follow a set of rules  @xcite  have been analyzed in various dynamical systems in physics , as well as in computational models and theoretical biology ; well - known examples include crystal growth and the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction . to simulate quantum mechanical phenomena , feynman  @xcite proposed a quantum cellular automaton ( the feynman checkerboard ) .",
    "this model , defined in the general case by meyer  @xcite , is known as the discrete - time quantum walk ( dtqw ) .",
    "since the dtqw on a graph is a model of a universal quantum computation  @xcite , it is of great utility , especially in quantum information  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dtqw has been demonstrated experimentally in various physical systems  @xcite to reveal quantum nature under dynamical systems .",
    "as the cellular automaton can be mapped to various differential equations by taking the continuous limit , some dtqw models can be mapped to the dirac equation  @xcite , the spatially discretized schrdinger equation  @xcite , the klein - gordon equation  @xcite , or various other differential equations  @xcite .",
    "these equations have ballistic transport properties , which are reflected mathematically in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) dtqw with a time- and spatial - independent coin operator , i.e. a 1d _ homogeneous _ dtqw  @xcite .",
    "we consider here the 1d dtqw model .",
    "physically , the standard deviation of the homogeneous dtqw is @xmath0 , whereas the unbiased classical random walk has a standard deviation of @xmath1 .    in the homogeneous dtqw",
    ", the time evolution of a quantum particle ( walker ) is given by a unitary operator @xmath2 defined on the composite hilbert space @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the walker hilbert space , and @xmath5 is the two - dimensional coin hilbert space . for a unitary operator @xmath2",
    ", the quantum state evolves in each time step @xmath6 by @xmath7 with @xmath8 where the upper @xmath9 ( lower @xmath10 ) component corresponds to the left ( right ) coin state at the @xmath11-th site at time step @xmath6 .",
    "as an example , the time evolution of the dtqw is given by @xmath12 the @xmath11-th site probability at time step @xmath6 is given by @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is satisfied for each time step @xmath6 .",
    "as a generalization of eq .",
    ", we define a dtqw with a feed - forward quantum coin described by @xmath15 with the site - dependent rate function @xmath16 which incorporates the nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "since this quantum coin depends on the probability distribution of the coin states on the nearest - neighbor sites at the previous step , this model is called a _",
    "feed - forward dtqw_. it is remarked that the feed - forward dtqw is one of the nonlinear dtqw models .",
    "note that if we set the rate function @xmath17 to @xmath18 , which is time and site independent , then the model in eq .",
    "reduces to the homogeneous model in eq .  .",
    "we will show that our proposed feed - forward dtqw is experimentally feasible .",
    "furthermore , we will show that this model shows the anomalous diffusion as introduced below .",
    "one of the famous anomalous diffusion equations is the porous medium equation ( pme )  @xcite , defined by @xmath19 where the real parameter @xmath20 characterizes the degree of porosity of the porous medium .",
    "it is known that the pme can be derived from three physical equations for the density @xmath21 , pressure @xmath22 , and velocity @xmath23 of the gas flow : the equation of continuity , @xmath24 ; darcy s law , @xmath25 ; and the equation of state for a polytropic gas , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the polytropic exponent and @xmath28 .",
    "one of the peculiar features of the pme is the so - called _ finite propagation _ , which implies the appearance of a _ free boundary _ separating the positive region ( @xmath29 ) from the empty region ( @xmath30 ) .    a well - known solution of the pme is the barenblatt - pattle ( bp ) one @xcite ; it is self - similar , and its total mass is conserved during evolution .",
    "the evolutionary behavior of the bp solution was recently studied in the context of generalized entropies and information geometry  @xcite .",
    "the bp solution can also be expressed by tsallis one - real - parameter ( @xmath31 ) generalization of a gaussian function , i.e. , the @xmath31-gaussian  @xcite . in the case of 1d space ,",
    "the bp solution is @xmath32^{\\frac{1}{1-q } }   \\equiv { \\exp_{q } } \\left ( -\\frac{x^2}{\\sigma_q^2(t ) } \\right ) ,   \\label{q - gaussian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 . here",
    ", @xmath34 is a positive parameter that characterizes the width of the @xmath31-gaussian at time @xmath6 and is similar to the variance @xmath35 in a standard gaussian . in other words ,",
    "the parameter @xmath36 characterizes the spread of the @xmath31-gaussian distribution @xcite ; @xmath37 which reduces to @xmath38 in the limit of @xmath39 .",
    "note that in the same limit , the @xmath31-gaussian reduces to the standard gaussian , @xmath40 , and the pme reduces to the standard heat equation @xmath41 .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a specific feed - forward dtqw with an experimental proposal using the polarized state and optical mode .",
    "we show numerically that the probability distributions of the feed - forward dtqw model have anomalous diffusion characterized by @xmath42 .",
    "these dynamics are consistent with the time evolution of the self - similar solution  @xcite of the pme , which is known to describe well the anomalous diffusion of an isotropic gas through a porous medium .",
    "furthermore , we show analytically that the interference terms in our model help the speedup of the associated markovian model but does not help the quadratic speedup like the homogeneous dtqw does  @xcite .",
    "note that although anomalous diffusion was found numerically in a nonlinear model  @xcite , an aperiodic time - dependent coin model  @xcite , and the history - dependent coin  @xcite from the time dependence of the variance @xmath43 , the partial differential equation ( pde ) corresponding to their models have not derived due to the lack of the numerical step ( about @xmath44 step ) .",
    "therefore , we have not yet revealed the origin of the anomalous diffusion in the dtqw .",
    "we propose an optical implementation of the feed - forward dtqw . in the simple optical implementation of the homogeneous dtqw",
    ", the walker space uses the spatial mode and the coin space does the polarized state .",
    "the shift uses the polarized beam splitter and the quantum coin uses the quarter - wave , half - wave , and quarter - wave plates , which can arbitrarily rotate the polarized state in the poincar sphere .",
    "this was experimentally done in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us construct the feed - forward system of the quantum coin .",
    "the detectors put at each path to evaluate the probability distribution of the coin state @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "since our proposed quantum coin depends on @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we can calculate the coin operator at the @xmath11th site . according to the jones calculation  @xcite to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ nostro_modello ] ) , we control the angels of the quarter - wave , half - wave , and quarter - wave plates for each path .",
    "this can be taken as the quantum coin operator with the feed - forward .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] ( a ) .",
    "it is noted that fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] ( b ) shows the short - time evolution of our proposed model for the experimental feasibility . in what follows ,",
    "we consider the long time time evolution of the feed - forward dtqw .      to study the time evolution of the feed - forward dtqw model",
    ", the initial state should have nonzero coin states at the nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "this can be easily understood by considering the following example .",
    "let us take @xmath49 as the only non - zero initial state . in this case , the rate is @xmath50 , because there is no neighboring state . from the map in eq .  , we see that the nonzero states at @xmath51 are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this gives @xmath54 , and we see that the only nonzero state is @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "this state at @xmath56 only differs in sign ( or phase ) from the initial state .",
    "thus if the initial state is concentrated at a single site , no spreading occurs ; the state only oscillates around the initial site .",
    "figure  [ fig : data2 ] ( a ) shows a typical probability distribution of the feed - forward dtqw after a long - time evolution . see the supplementary movie for more details .",
    "the initial state was set as @xmath57 .",
    "we note that the probability distribution diffuses very slowly and does not approach a gaussian .",
    "these features are often observed in anomalous diffusion .",
    "it is also remarked that such behavior has not yet seen in dtqws with the position - dependent coin  @xcite , which show the localization property .",
    "we performed long - time numerical simulations of the feed - forward dtqw model [ eq .  ] for up to @xmath58 steps . to study the asymptotic behavior , we take running averages of the numerical solutions to reduce the influence of multiple spikes .",
    "the averaged data were fitted with the @xmath31-gaussian of eq .   to determine the corresponding @xmath31-generalized standard deviation @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data2 ] ( b ) .",
    "we note that the averaged data at each time step are well fitted by the @xmath31-gaussian with @xmath59 .",
    "the long - time evolution of @xmath36 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : data2 ] ( c ) , reveals that the time evolution of the feed - forward dtqw model is well characterized by @xmath60 , which is the same time dependency for @xmath59 of the pme [ eq .  ] .",
    "the relationship between our model and the pme can be explored using the decomposition method of romanelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which the unitary evolution of a dtqw model is decomposed into markovian and interference terms .",
    "we obtain the following map for both coin distributions @xmath61 and @xmath62 : @xmath63 where the two terms including @xmath64 $ ] are interference terms , and @xmath65 $ ] is the real part of a complex number @xmath66 .    neglecting the interference terms and introducing the abbreviations @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", we get the _ associated markovian model _ ;",
    "@xmath69 the numerical simulation of the associated markovian model is performed under initial conditions of @xmath70 , and the typical probability distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : markov ] ( a ) is well fitted by the @xmath31-gaussian with @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : markov ] ( b ) shows that the time evolution of @xmath36 of the associated markovian model is well fitted to @xmath72 , which again is the same time dependency as the pme for @xmath73 .",
    "it is known that the classical markovian model , i.e. one without the interference terms of the homogeneous dtqw , satisfies the standard heat equation in the continuous limit .",
    "consequently , the associated asymptotic probability distribution is a standard gaussian .",
    "this implies that the ballistic transport property of the homogeneous dtqw comes from the interference term  @xcite .",
    "we thus consider the continuous limit  @xcite of the associated markovian model .",
    "we introduce the density @xmath74 and current @xmath75 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the difference of the nearest - neighbor sites . taking a taylor expansion of eq .  , we get @xmath78 in the diffusion limit , i.e. , the quantity @xmath79 remains constant ( set to unity here for simplicity ) as @xmath80 with the one - step time difference @xmath81 . in a similar manner , by expanding eq .   and",
    "taking the diffusion limit , we obtain @xmath82 which implies a breakdown in fick s first law ( @xmath83 ) and is the hallmark of anomalous diffusion . by substituting eq .   into eq .",
    ", we obtain the following nonlinear pde : @xmath84 evaluating the asymptotic solution of this nonlinear pde , after a long - time evolution , @xmath74 becomes much less than unity . as the rough approximation in this long - time limit",
    ", we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and eq .",
    "is thus well approximated by @xmath87 which is nothing but the pme in eq .   with @xmath88 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the approximated asymptotic solution of eq .   is a @xmath31-gaussian with @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , we can show that this result is mathematically valid by applying the asymptotic lie symmetry method  @xcite ( see method ) .",
    "this method can give an equivalence between the asymptotic solution of the pde and the analytically - solved one of the other pde without analytically solving this pde .",
    "therefore , the associated markovian model exhibits anomalous diffusion described by the pme in eq .   with @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that the interference term of our model leads to the speed - up of the quantum walker @xmath89 compared to the associated markovian model @xmath90 and makes the zig - zag shape around the @xmath31-gaussian distribution .    in summary",
    ", we have proposed a feed - forward dtqw model eq .",
    "in which the coin operator depends on the coin states of the nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "we show that this model is experimentally feasible .",
    "our feed - forward dtqw model asymptotically satisfies the pme for @xmath91 and exhibits anomalous slow diffusion @xmath92 from the probability distribution and the time dependency of the standard deviation defined in the @xmath31-gaussian distribution .",
    "in this section , we show that our results after the long - time numerical simulations have no initial coin dependence , and that the interference term can be taken as the noise source in addition to the pme .",
    "first , while the above analysis uses the only fixed initial coin states as @xmath57 , we numerically confirm that there is almost no dependence of the initial coin state except for the trivial cases as follows .",
    "we have performed the several numerical simulations for the initial state specified by @xmath93 and @xmath94 with the real - parameter @xmath95 and @xmath96 ranging from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "note that the trivial cases , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , lead to the localization of the probability distribution for any time , and we can not define the parameter @xmath31 for the trivial initial states .",
    "figure  [ fig : initial ] shows the numerical evaluation of the parameter @xmath31 of @xmath31-gaussian distribution from the data at the two different time steps @xmath101 and @xmath102 , under the assumption to satisfy the stationary solution of the pme [ eqs .",
    "( [ q - gaussian ] ) and ( [ sig_q4pme ] ) ] .",
    "the evaluated @xmath31-parameters for the various initial states are @xmath103 except for the trivial cases .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that our nonlinear model shows the anomalous slow diffusion to satisfy the pme with @xmath104 without the initial state dependence .",
    "finally , let us consider the difference between the probability distribution of our model and the @xmath31-gaussian distribution with @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data2 ] ( b ) ; the power spectrum of this difference exhibits a white noise as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] .",
    "this power spectrum divided by the physical time scale @xmath105 may remain finite in the asymptotic case , which suggests that our nonlinear model may be mapped to the stochastic pme , i.e. the pme plus a white noise term , in the continuous limit .",
    "this stochasticity must come from the interference term .",
    "the problem of extracting the stochasticity from a deterministic process has been discussed in another context , that of mori s noise  @xcite .",
    "further analysis of this model may reveal the origin of the stochasticity .",
    "this is interesting as a purely mathematical problem of a stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation and for showing the relationship between the discrete model and its continuous limit .",
