    "since the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ was launched in 2008 june , the main instrument on - board  the large area telescope ( lat ) has been continuously scanning the whole sky every three hours in the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev , discovering and monitoring @xmath2-ray sources with much improved spatial resolution and sensitivity comparing to former @xmath2-ray telescopes @xcite . in 2012 , using _",
    "fermi_/lat data of the first two - year survey , a catalog of 1873 @xmath2-ray sources was released by @xcite as the _ fermi_/lat second source catalog ( 2fgl ) . among the @xmath2-ray sources , 575 of them",
    "are not associated with any known astrophysical objects @xcite . for the purpose of identifying the nature of these unassociated sources ,",
    "many follow - up studies , such as classifying their @xmath2-ray characteristics @xcite , searching for radio pulsars @xcite , and observing at multi - wavelengths @xcite , have been carried out .",
    "the source 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 is sufficiently bright that it was listed as 1fgl  j0523.5@xmath02529 in the _ fermi _   lat first source catalog @xcite . _",
    "swift _ imaging of the field has revealed a candidate x - ray counterpart @xcite .",
    "while radio searches for a pulsar have failed @xcite , optical imaging and spectroscopy recently have discovered orbital modulations from the x - ray counterpart , with a period of 16.5 hr ( @xcite ) .",
    "the source is located at a high galactic latitude @xmath3 , and has a late - g or early - k spectral type secondary star , and @xmath2-ray luminosity of @xmath4 erg  s@xmath5 ( assuming source distance @xmath6 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "based on these properties , @xcite suggested that the source is likely a millisecond pulsar binary ( msp ) with a 0.8  @xmath7 companion .",
    "furthermore , this binary could be another so - called  redback \" system , which is classified as an eclipsing msp binary that contains a relatively massive ( @xmath8 ) , non - degenerate companion @xcite .",
    "the ablation of the companion by pulsar wind from the msp produces matter in the binary , which would eclipse radio emission from the pulsar at certain orbital phases .",
    "we were intrigued by this _",
    "fermi _ source because we note that it is located in the blazer region , along with the crab pulsar , in the curvature  variability plane of _ fermi _  bright sources ( see figure  4 in @xcite ) , which suggests possible variability from this source .",
    "it has recently been learned that the prototypical redback system psr  j1023 + 0038 @xcite has shown @xmath2-ray variability due to its temporary accretion activity @xcite . the newly identified redback system xss j12270@xmath04859 , which underwent a transition from an x - ray binary to a msp binary in 2012 nov.dec .",
    "@xcite , is also known to have @xmath2-ray  emission @xcite .",
    "given the discovery of the orbital period of 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 and its properties listed above , we have thus carried out detailed analysis of the _ fermi _  data for this source , aiming to study the source s @xmath2-ray flux variations , determine its high - energy properties , and establish the similarities to the redback systems psr  j1023 + 0038 and xss j12270@xmath04859 in particular .",
    "in addition , since there are two sets of archival _ swift _ x - ray data available for the source , we also conducted the x - ray data analysis . in this paper , we report the results from the analyses .",
    "lat is the main instrument onboard _",
    "fermi_. it is a @xmath2-ray imaging instrument which makes all - sky survey in an energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev @xcite . in our analysis , we selected lat events from the _ fermi _ pass 7 reprocessed ( p7rep ) database inside a @xmath9 region centered at the catalog position of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 @xcite .",
    "we kept events during the time period from 2008 - 08 - 04 15:43:36 to 2014 - 04 - 02 01:49:57 ( utc ) , and rejected events below 200 mev because of the relative large uncertainties of the instrument response function of the lat in the low energy range .",
    "in addition we followed the recommendations of the lat team to include only events with zenith angle less than 100 , which prevents the earth s limb contamination , and during good time intervals when the quality of the data was not affected by the spacecraft events .",
    "we included all sources within 16  centered at the position of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 in the _ fermi _ 2-year catalog @xcite to make the source model .",
    "the spectral models of these sources are provided in the catalog .",
    "the spectral normalization parameters of the sources within 8 degrees from 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 were set free , and all the other parameters of the sources were fixed at their catalog values .",
    "we also included the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission in the source model , with the spectral model gll_iem_v05.fits and the spectrum file iso_source_v05.txt used , respectively .",
    "the normalizations of the diffuse components were set as free parameters .",
    "we performed standard binned likelihood analysis to the lat @xmath10.2 gev data using the lat science tools software package v9r23p5 , and extracted the test statistic ( ts ) map of a @xmath10 region centered at the position of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 ( panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : map ] ) , with all sources in the source model considered .",
    "a ts value is calculated from ts @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the maximum likelihood values for a model without and with an additional source at a specified location , respectively , and is a measurement of the fit improvement for including the source .",
    "generally the ts is approximately the square of the detection significance of a source @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-ray emission near the center was detected with ts@xmath14800 , indicating @xmath1528@xmath16 detection significance .",

    "the catalog position of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 is r.a.=8083 , decl.=@xmath02550 ( equinox j2000.0 ) , and the position of the optical binary is r.a.=808205 , decl.=@xmath0254603 ( equinox j2000.0 , @xcite ; the uncertainty is determined by the usno - b systematic accuracy of 02 , @xcite ) .",
    "the optical position is @xmath15003 from the best - fit position , but within the 2@xmath16 error circle .",
    "the @xmath10.2 gev emission from 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 was analyzed by modeling with a simple power law and an exponentially cutoff power law ( characteristic of pulsar @xmath2-rayemission ) , respectively .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : likelihood ] .",
    "the source modeled with the power - law spectrum was found to have spectral index @xmath17 and a ts@xmath18 value of @xmath14848 , while with the exponentially cutoff power - law spectrum have @xmath19 , cutoff energy @xmath20  gev , and a ts@xmath21 value of @xmath14889 .",
    "therefore the cutoff was detected with @xmath156@xmath16 significance ( estimated from @xmath22 ) .          to investigate the variability of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530",
    ", we extracted different time - interval @xmath2-ray light curves at different energy bands ( @xmath10.2 gev , @xmath11 gev , or @xmath12 gev bands ) .",
    "the light curves were extracted by performing likelihood analysis to the lat data in each time bins .",
    "the emission of a point source with a power - law spectrum at the best - fit position was considered for the source .",
    "the spectral index was fixed at the value given in table  [ tab : likelihood ] . by comparing the obtained ts values at the source position",
    ", we found that the @xmath11  gev , 90-day interval light curve shows the most significant variations . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , we display the light curve and ts curve .",
    "it is clear that ts value varies between 1080 , while the corresponding flux shows a factor of 4 variation . as a comparison , we also obtained the 0.21.0 gev light curve and ts curve and plot them in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the low energy ts curve generally has low values , similar to those of the @xmath11 gev one when the latter is in a ` low ' state .",
    "the flux is approximately 10@xmath23 photons@xmath24s@xmath5 , consistent with being a constant within the uncertainties .",
    "based on the ts curve , we defined six time intervals . in interval ii and iv ,",
    "the ts curve is flat with values of @xmath2520 , while in interval i and iii , the ts curve has values of 3080 . in intervals v and vi , the ts values are mostly low but with weak variations in a range of 1030 . to confirm the variations seen in the light curves",
    ", we further extracted the @xmath11 gev ts maps during the six time intervals . in figure",
    "[ fig : map ] , we display the ts maps of intervals i and ii as the examples for the source being bright and dim , respectively .",
    "the variations are real .",
    "the ts values at the source position are @xmath14170 and @xmath1460 in the two maps , indicating approximately 10@xmath16 significance for the flux variation between the two time intervals .",
    "we noted that as shown in panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : map ] ( when the source was dim ) , the ts peak appears to have an offset from the best - fit position .",
    "we determined the source position for time interval ii and found that the position is consistent with the best - fit position within 2@xmath16 .",
    "we further checked the ts maps when the source was dim ( time intervals iv , v , and vi ) , and the ts peaks all appear to have small offsets from the best - fit position but in different directions . in our analysis ,",
    "this _ fermi _  source is consistent with being a point source , and no signs of extended emission or an additional source were found .",
    "we concluded that the apparent offsets are probably due to under - estimated uncertainties for the source position .",
    "the @xmath2-ray spectrum of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 was extracted by performing maximum likelihood analysis to the lat data in 15 evenly divided energy bands in logarithm from 0.1300 gev .",
    "the source was modeled with a power - law spectrum , and the spectral index was fixed at the value we obtained above ( table  [ tab : likelihood ] ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath2-ray spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] and the values at each bin are given in table  [ tab : spec ] , in which the spectral points with ts greater than 4 were kept .",
    "the cutoff power law model is also displayed in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the model does not describe the low - energy data points well , as two data points are approximately 2@xmath16 away from the cutoff power - law model ( black dashed curve in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .    to search for differences in the source s emission during the ` high ' and ` low ' states shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] , and thus help understand the cause of the flux variation , we extracted @xmath2-ray spectra of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 during the two states .",
    "we used ts=30 for defining the source s two states .",
    "the obtained spectra during the high ( ts@xmath26 ) and low ( ts@xmath2530 ) states are plotted in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the flux values are given in table  [ tab : spec ] . by comparing the two spectra ,",
    "a component at the 23 gev energy range during the high state is present .",
    "we therefore further modeled the low state emission with a cutoff power law , and found @xmath27 , @xmath28 gev .",
    "this model is displayed in the right panel of figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , showing that it well describes the low - state spectrum and the high - state one when excluding the 23 gev data points .",
    "a gaussian function , @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30erg@xmath24s@xmath5 , @xmath31gev , and @xmath32gev , may be added to the model spectrum to describe the extra component .",
    "the reduced @xmath33 , which is 3.2 ( for 6 degrees of freedom ) when comparing the high - state spectrum with the cutoff power law , is improved to 1.0 ( for 3 degrees of freedom ) when the gaussian component is included .          around the frequency 1.68195@xmath34 hz , which was determined from optical radial velocity measurements by @xcite ,",
    "orbital modulations were searched in @xmath2-rayemission of the source .",
    "the search was performed to the lat data within 10 from the optical position of 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 , and _ gtpsearch _ in the lat software package was used .",
    "the optical position was used for the barycentric correction to photon arrival times .",
    "different energy ranges of @xmath10.2 gev , @xmath11 gev , @xmath12 gev , and @xmath13 gev were considered in our search .",
    "no significant signals were found for the whole data .",
    "we also searched in the individual time periods marked by figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "no signals were detected during the high state ; in the low state marginal signals were seen , but none of them were sufficiently convincing as the @xmath35-test values for the signals were approximately 10 .    given the uncertainty of the orbital period",
    ", we considered that in time intervals v and vi , the optical timing results are reliable ( note that the binary orbit was determined from optical observations during from 2013 - 10 - 01 to 2014 - 01 - 10 ; @xcite ) and the source was mostly in the low state .",
    "we thus searched for periodic signals during a slightly longer time period from 2012 - 10 - 01 to the end of the lat data we analyzed .",
    "folding @xmath12 gev data at the optical period , a signal with @xmath35-test value of 15 was found .",
    "following @xcite , we also made two ts maps over two half orbital phases to confirm the detection of the orbital flux variations .",
    "phase i is the half of the orbit centered at the superior conjunction ( when the secondary is behind the primary star ) , and phase ii is the other half centered at the inferior conjunction .",
    "the ts maps are shown in figure  [ fig : ts - timing ] .",
    "the @xmath12 gev @xmath2-ray emission from 2fgl j0523.3@xmath02530 during phase ii is more significantly detected than that during phase i , with ts values of @xmath1490 and @xmath1420 , respectively , at the source position .",
    "we also searched for the periodic signals in the same energy range and over the same time period . a signal with @xmath35 test value of @xmath1418 ( @xmath154@xmath16 detection significance ) at the frequency of 1.682246@xmath36",
    "hz was found .",
    "this frequency is within the 5@xmath16 error range of the optical orbital value .",
    "the folded light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : timing ] , where phase zero is set at the superior conjunction ( mjd 56577.14636 , given by @xcite ) .",
    "the source was brighter during the phase of 0.250.55 ( phase ii is 0.250.75 ) .",
    "spectra during the on - peak and off - peak phases were obtained , but due to limited numbers of photons , the uncertainties on the flux data points are too large to allow any further detailed analysis .",
    "no attempt was made to search for millisecond spin signals from the primary star , since it is difficult and computing - intensive to find from blind searches of _ fermi _ @xmath2-ray data , and thus far only one msp has been found from blind searches @xcite .",
    "we note that to search for the spin signal from the putative msp , the low - state time periods should be considered , since emission during the time would primarily come from the pulsar ( see section  [ sec : disc ] below ) .",
    "the source 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530  was observed with _ swift _ on 2009 nov 12 ( obsid : 00031535001 ) and on 2013 sep 17 ( obsid : 00032938001 ) for 4.8 and 14.4ks , respectively .",
    "we analyzed the photon counting mode data from the x - ray telescope .",
    "the data were processed by the standard pipeline , and in both observations , an x - ray source is clearly detected at the optical position . using a standard extraction aperture of 20pixels",
    "(= 471 ) radius , we obtained @xmath37 and @xmath38 background - subtracted counts for the first and second exposures , respectively , in 0.37kev .",
    "these correspond to count rates of @xmath39 and @xmath40ctss@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "given the large uncertainties , these two values are formally consistent .",
    "the source was too faint and the two observations were too short ( comparing to the orbital period ) to be searched for orbital modulation .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum from the merged data set using the aperture mention above .",
    "the spectral analysis was carried out in xspec in the 0.37kev energy range , using the telescope response files provided by the calibration team .",
    "for the spectral fit , we employed the c - statistic ( cstat in xspec ) to perform unbinned likelihood analysis due to the low number of counts .",
    "we first tried an absorbed power - law model , but found a very small absorption column density .",
    "this is not surprising since the source is at a high galactic latitude and the total galactic column density in the direction is only @xmath41@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "we therefore did not include absorption in the final fit and obtained a photon index of @xmath42 with a goodness - of - fit equivalent to a reduced @xmath33 value of 0.96 .",
    "the energy flux is @xmath43erg@xmath24s@xmath5 in 0.37kev .",
    "from our analysis of the _ fermi _  data for 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 , we have found significant @xmath2-ray  flux variations over approximately 5.5 yr _ fermi _  observation time .",
    "spectral analysis of the data during the high and low states indicates that emission from the source in the latter is well described by an exponentially cutoff power law , which is typical for pulsar emission . comparing to the msps detected with _",
    "@xcite , the cutoff energy is among the highest but within the uncertainties ( the highest value with smaller uncertainty is @xmath441.1 ) .",
    "if this source is an msp binary as suggested , the emission in the low state is likely dominated by that from the pulsar ( however , see discussion below ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] , in the low state , the ts values in the energy ranges of 0.21 gev and 1 - 300 gev are consistently low , not having any drastically differences as seen in the high state .",
    "our spectral analysis also shows that the variability mainly comes from the presence of an extra component at 23 gev .",
    "we note that the flux changes could be rapid .",
    "for example , at the beginning of time interval i ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) , the flux has a sudden increase by a factor of 4 . to investigate the jump",
    ", we also made a 10-day interval light curve , and the sudden jump still exists , which suggests that the time scale for the flux change would probably be within 10 days .",
    "this time scale is reminiscent of psr j1023 + 0038 in 2013 late june , when the pulsar binary was found to have an accretion disk again @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-ray  flux from the pulsar binary was also 10 times larger than before , a factor of 2 times higher than what was seen in 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 .",
    "would the flux changes be also due to the presence of an accretion disk if the source is considered as another transitional pulsar binary ?",
    "the non - detection of any orbital modulation signals during the high state would support this scenario , since additional emission from the temporary disk is suggested to be the cause of @xmath2-ray   brightening seen in psr  j1023 + 0038 @xcite .",
    "however , the optical light curve of 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530  reported by @xcite does not support such a case .",
    "the light curve was from data points taken from 2005 august to 2013 april , which covers the _ fermi _  observation time , but does not show any signs of irradiation of the companion or additional optical emission from a disk .",
    "we also note that the two sets of x - ray data were taken both during the low state , which may explain the consistent faintness of the source during the two x - ray observations .",
    "we have detected orbital modulation in @xmath2-ray   emission of 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 , although only in the last 1.5 yr data of the total _",
    "fermi _  observation . unfortunately due to the limited photon counts , we were not able to obtain any spectral information about the differences between the on - peak and off - peak emission . thus far the prototypical black window pulsar binary b1957 + 20 ,",
    "in which a degenerate , low - mass companion is under strong irradiation by pulsar wind from an msp @xcite , is the only compact binary detected with orbital @xmath2-ray   modulation @xcite .",
    "similarly , phase ii of this binary was found to be brighter , due to excess emission at the @xmath1 2.7 gev high energy range .",
    "the excesses have been explained to be due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the thermal photons from the companion by the pulsar wind ( see @xcite for details ) . the same radiation mechanism has been considered by @xcite also for modulated @xmath2-ray   emission from msp binaries , although the detailed physical processes are different . in any case , the modulation arises due to changes of the viewing angle to the intrabinary @xmath2-ray   producing region as the binary rotates .",
    "the high cutoff energy seen in 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530   in the low state could be because there is a similar extra component , arising from the intrabinary interaction .",
    "the fact that orbital modulation only appears in @xmath12 gev emission supports this possibility .",
    "in addition , the x - ray emission had a power - law spectrum similar to that of psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite and xss  j12270@xmath04859 @xcite , and black widow pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the _ swift _ x - ray luminosity was 1.9@xmath45ergs@xmath5 ( at distance 1.1kpc ) , lower but comparable to that of psr j1023 + 0038 and xss  j12270@xmath04859 when these two sources are at their no - disk states .",
    "the x - ray similarity thus suggests the existence of the intrabinary interaction as well .",
    "we may even speculate that the yearly variability of 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530  is due to an enhanced intrabinary interaction of the pulsar wind with the companion ( or outflow of the companion ) , resulting in the presence of the 23 gev component .",
    "however , if this is the case , we would probably expect easier detection of orbital modulation when the source was in the high state , contrary to what is learned from our data analysis .    due to the relatively large , 002 error circle of _ fermi _  sources",
    ", it can be difficult to exclude any possible contamination from other sources within the error circle .",
    "for example , in the xss  j12270@xmath04859 field , a radio - jet source and a candidate galaxy cluster have been found , which may contribute to @xmath2-ray  emission ( and possible flux variations ) detected @xcite .",
    "we note that in the simbad database , none of the known nearby sources in the field could possibly be associated with 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 , although @xcite have very recently reported the detection of a radio source 0037 away in their effort to search for possibly associated radio sources with _ fermi _   objects . the majority of the high galactic _ fermi",
    "_  objects ( @xmath46 ) are associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ; @xcite ) , and they are strong variable sources . however no evidence supports the presence of an agn in the field .",
    "emission from agn generally has a power - law form , arising due to ic scattering by high - energy electrons in jets from agn @xcite .",
    "their spectral features ( e.g. , @xcite ) are clearly different from that seen in the high state of 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 : if there is an agn causing the variability , the flux increases should have occurred over the whole energy range . moreover , the probability of having a @xmath2-ray  emitting agn in the field is really low . on the basis of",
    "the agn counts distribution study in @xcite , the number of agn with _",
    "@xmath2-ray  fluxes greater than 10@xmath23ph@xmath24s@xmath5 is 0.064 deg@xmath47 . for the 006 radius ( 3@xmath16 ) error circle region ,",
    "the probability of having at least one such agn is only 6.8@xmath48 .",
    "given these reasons , it is not likely that the variability is caused by the existence of an unknown agn .    as a summary",
    ", we have detected orbital modulation in @xmath12 gev @xmath2-ray  emission of 2fgl  j0523.3@xmath02530 , which confirms the association of this source with the optical binary .",
    "in addition , long - term , yearly variability from this @xmath2-ray  source has also been detected , and the flux increases are due to the presence of an extra emission component at 23 gev .",
    "the origin of the component as well as the variability is not clear . in the near future ,",
    "multiwavelength studies of the source and source field should be conducted , aiming to detect any correlated flux variations at optical / x - ray energies and help determine the origin of the high - energy component and its variability .",
