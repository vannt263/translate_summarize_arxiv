    "one possible way to overcome this difficulty is to alloy palladium with copper  @xcite . in order to realize hydrogen capture and sequester , new membranes with different chemical compositions that resist sulfidization need to be devised , and their reactivity to sulfur needs to be examined .",

    "our model begins with first principles total energies , moves to focus on substitutional entropy , then examines vibrations .",
    "comparison with experimental results shows general agreement .",
    "certain details of energetics are explored through examination of the electronic density of states .",
    "we then apply our model to predict sulfidization threshholds for pd interacting with s dimers and activities in cu - pd binaries .",
    "in order to calculate a phase diagram using first principles methods , all plausible crystal structures must be considered , in principle . in the case of cu - pd - s , a wealth of experimental crystallographic data",
    "gives an excellent starting point , especially for the binary compounds .",
    "we generalize these binaries to ternary structures formed from substituions of the ternary specie into either lattice sites or interstitial sites .",

    ", we only calculate the ideal 1d lps , cu@xmath2pd.tp28 , ( using a notation of [ chemical formula].pearson symbol ) and ignore the 2d lps and phase solubility ranges in the 1d lps .",
    "determination of the phase diagram for cu - s  @xcite using first principles calculations is problematic , as it contains an abundance of phases , many of which are non - stoichiometric or have large unit cells .",

    "we summarize the phase diagrams here only for comparison ; our method does not require pre - existing knowledge of the phase diagrams .    in order to add temperature dependence to the phase diagrams , we introduce free energy models for select phases of interest , all of which are based on substitutional solid solution models with sublattice filling ( where for some structures , the `` sublattice '' is the entire lattice ) . when calculating the ternary phase diagram and the activities , we work in the gibbs ensemble , where we specify temperature , pressure , and chemical concentration .",

    "since we work with a fixed number of sites , we fix the total concentration of substitutions , and thus minimize the free energy over all x@xmath11 subject to the constraint of specie number conservation .    to better elucidate the model , we restrict to the special case of where only one type of substitution ( with an enthalpic cost of @xmath19 ) is allowed in only one sublattice containing n@xmath17 sites .",

    "of particular importance is the entropic contribution to the free energy , @xmath28 which we use for all phases modeled throughout this paper .    in order for a given substitution type to appreciably affect the free energy ,",
    "the two necessary features are large @xmath29 values , corresponding to a sublattice dense in the total lattice and thus a significant entropic contribution from the sublattice , and small positive ( or any negative ) enthalpic cost @xmath30 for the substitutions , such that at a given temperature the entropic portion of the free energy can overcome the enthalpic cost ( or reinforce the enthalpic gain ) .",

    "[ eq : eof ] and [ eq : de ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this last section , the activities of species in binary cu - pd are calculated , as these can be used to predict sulfidization threshholds for cu - pd in the presence of s. we wish here to find the activities across the entire composition range with multiple phases .    the definition for the activity of a specie a as a function of composition @xmath31 , pressure p , and temperature t is  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the activity for specie a",
    ", @xmath34 is the chemical potential for specie a , and @xmath35 is a reference chemical potential for specie a. as we are specifying @xmath31 , p , and t , the natural choice of thermodynamic potential is the gibbs free energy , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the total number of a and b atoms , respectively , and the thermodynamic derivative giving the chemical potential is @xmath39 however , the quantity of importance for phase transitions is the gibbs free energy per atom , @xmath40 we may express the chemical potential in terms of intensive quantities as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the composition of species i , and we have chosen to parameterize the free energy by the composition for a. similarly , @xmath43 these activities depend only on the free energy and the derivative of the free energy at a given composition .",
    "they are piecewise analytic functions across the composition range , completely determined by the thermodynamically stable phase at that composition .",
    "the activities can therefore be viewed as alternative representation of the underlying phase diagram for the system .",
    "they are discontinuous only when the derivative of the free energy changes ( the free energy itself must always be continuous , due to the requirement of convexity ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", we believe the magnitude of the calculated free energy of our fcc phase is artificially large , destabilizing the @xmath1 phase , and thus any calculated activities would be flawed near the 50% cu region of the phase diagram . to support this assertion , here we refit the fcc phase using only low - solubility first principles data on either side of the composition range .",
    "this reduces the magnitude of the free energy of the fcc phase while still using first principles derived calculations .",
    "this should not be viewed as abandoning our pure first principles phase diagram as shown before , but rather a correction inspired by known experimental results presented in an alternative - but - equivalent format .",
    "the sqs estimate for fcc at 50% pd lies almost directly on this free energy curve , further supporting its usage for quantitative estimates .",
    "we also neglect phonon free energy for activity calculations , as for ordered fcc and bcc at 50% pd , the difference in phonon free energy per atom is only 2 mev at t=1000k .    shown below in figure [ fig : cupdactivities ] in solid lines are our calculated activities for palladium in the cu - pd binary , using the free energy models from table [ tab : phaseeqs ] , the modified fcc phase , and our calculated data for cu@xmath2pd .",
    "the @xmath1 phase is the sharply increasing region in the center of the graph .",
    "this sharp behavior is due to the entropic portion of the free energy , which has a logrithmic singularity at x=0.5 and sharply varying derivitive near this singularity .",
    "the smooth curves on the left and right sides of the graph for t@xmath441000k denote the fcc phase .",
    "linear free energy functions give constant activities as a function of composition , and thus phase coexistence regimes appear as plateaus in activities , at a fixed temperature .",
    "two sets of plateaus are present .",
    "the set of plateaus on the left side are coexistence regimes between the bcc and fcc phases .",
    "there are 3 types of plateaus on the right side . for t @xmath44 900k ,",
    "the plateaus are due to coexistence with the line compound cu@xmath2pd , where the plateaus in the region @xmath45 indicate coexistence with bcc and the plateaus at @xmath46 indicate coexistence with fcc .",
    "the plateau on the right side of the plot for t=900k is a special case .",
    "our free energy models predict that the cu@xmath2pd phase becomes thermodynamically unstable at 899k and fcc becomes stable , so the plateau at 900k indicates coexistence between bcc and fcc . at a temperature of 960k ,",
    "our model predicts that the bcc phase becomes unstable relative to the fcc phase , disappearing at a composition of x=0.576 . by decreasing the fcc free energy magnitude",
    "we have properly stabilized the @xmath1 phase at temperatures of interest and brought the transition temperature to within 90k of the expected value .",
    "the 1000k and 1350k plots are pure fcc throughout the entire composition range .    the activities of pd at various temperatures",
    "were also calculated using calphad ( acronym of calculation of phase diagrams ) method .",
    "the thermodynamic database developed by li et al@xcite was used .",
    "our activities are systematically low compared to the calphad activities ( shown in dashed lines on figure [ fig : cupdactivities ] ) , most likely due to our ideal entropy approximation . as the true entropy in solid solutions is reduced relative to the ideal entropy , the true free energy will be greater , leading to the true activities being greater than our calculated activities .",
    "this is especially true for fcc , where the refitted free energy still overestimates the magnitude of the free energy and leads to qualitatively different behavior in the high pd limit .",
    "calphad results give activities that exceed raoult s law in the high pd limit , which would require positive enthalpies of formation for cu substitution in pd using a solid substitution model in the dilute limit .",
    "this contradicts first principle calculations which unambiguously predict cu substitutions in bulk pd having negative enthalpies of formation ( see figure [ fig : binaryphase ] ) .",
    "clearly more precise models are needed to understand the binary in the high pd limit . however , for the @xmath1 phase and associated coexistence regimes , the first principles and calphad results are in close agreement , and if one is interested in regions outside the single - phase fcc region , first principles calculations gives reasonably accurate results even with simple models .",
    "using only first principles calculations and solid solution models , we were able to semi - quantitatively model the ternary phase diagram for the cu - pd - s system without any empirical fitting parameters .",
    "we obtained the sulfidization threshholds for the pd - s@xmath0 system and activities that reflect the essential features of the cu - pd binary system at temperatures where multiple phases exist across the composition range .",
    "more detailed models are necessary to reach better quantitative agreement with experimental results .",
    "however , our work reveals the essential physics underlying the phase behavior .",
    "for example , we distinguish enthalpic vs. entropic driven substitution , and we identify a pseudogap stabilization mechanism , yielding a temperature - independent solubility range for cu in pd@xmath3s@xmath4 .",
    "we are grateful to b. gleeson , m. mihalkovi , and j. kitchin for useful discussion .",
