    "the [ s ii ] @xmath5 image of @xcite showed that the blueshifted jet lies exactly along the position angle of 130  at least up to 110 . the jet is marginally resolved within 56 au by cfht adaptive optics and _ hst_/stis .",
    "widths of the jet slowly increase beyond this distance with an opening angle of 3  to 4  @xcite , and they appear to expand more rapidly closer to the source ( within 05 ) than farther away .",
    "such trends of jet widths have been difficult to interpret in the past @xcite , as often the observed widths were interpreted as the extent of bow shock wings and the true jet should be much narrower .",
    "farther than 05 from the sources , the widths of the rw aur a jet become wider as the intensity decreases along the jet axis , which was also observed by _",
    "hst _ for hh 34 @xcite .",
    "the fluxes of both blueshifted and redshifted jets decrease by an order of magnitude from 05 to within 2  from the star .",
    "@xcite considered the measured widths marginally consistent with an x - wind jet in @xcite and the self - similar disk wind model in @xcite at high accretion efficiencies .",
    "kinematics based on long - slit spectroscopy makes the rw aur a jet a textbook example of a microjet .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams of its brightest forbidden lines , such as [ s ii ] , [ o i ] , and [ n ii ] , clearly display one single intensity peak at each position along the jet axis .",
    "the centroid velocity lies around 100 kms@xmath4  which is identified as the high - velocity gas tracing the collimated jet .",

    "although @xcite and @xcite reported detections of some low - velocity peaks in [ o i ] @xmath9 , these peaks were highly variable and have been discarded as simply transient on a timescale of months .",
    "the strong collimated emission at high velocity makes the rw aur a jet one of the ideal candidates to confront with models of magnetocentrifugally - driven winds arising from a narrow region close to the inner - edge of the disks , for example , those that may resemble the x - winds @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is our primary goal to compare this set of data with the best fits generated by models based on the x - wind solutions using approaches outlined in @xcite .    despite the predominant high - velocity emission , asymmetry across the opposite sides of the rw aur a jet",
    "has long been documented in the literature @xcite .",
    "the level of asymmetry in rw aur a is among the largest in the 8 asymmetric t - tauri jets reported in @xcite , who excluded interpretations based on different spatial orientations on opposite sides of the source , uncorrelated time - variabilities , different degrees of deceleration , or different degrees of collimation .",
    "instead , they concluded that such strong asymmetry should arise in the acceleration process of the jet itself .",
    "@xcite derived a velocity ratio of @xmath10 within 05 from the source with the _",
    "hst_/stis , and attributed the origin of asymmetry to the `` central engine '' .",
    "@xcite measured proper motions of the knots and found that they have the same ratios as their radial velocities , and the velocity asymmetry should be intrinsic to the jet .",
    "the ratios of proper motion are maintained well up to 46 and 16 from the source , along the blueshifted and redshifted jets , respectively @xcite .",
    "we will treat the velocity asymmetry as an intrinsic property built in our models to explain the overall phenomena .",
    "the asymmetry exists not only in flow velocities but also in line intensities and physical conditions derived from the line ratios .",
    "@xcite noted that the two opposite sides of the jet differ significantly in their spatial extent , with the [ s ii ] jet extending to @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the blueshifted and redshifted sides , respectively . the red jet is brighter in the inner @xmath13 @xcite , and remains so down to 02 from the source as seen in both optical @xcite and near - infrared @xcite .",

    "the faintness of the blue jet prevented @xcite from attempting a reliable diagnostic analysis using ground - based spectra , which led @xcite to assume similar [ n ii ] @xmath17/[o i ] @xmath9 and [ s ii ] @xmath15/[o i ] @xmath9 ratios for both sides of the jet for the _ hst_/stis spectra in their later analysis .",
    "@xcite re - examined the same stis dataset and obtained a smaller [ n ii ] @xmath18/[o i ] @xmath19 but a larger [ s ii ] @xmath5/[o i ] @xmath19 in the red jet , which imply a lower ionization fraction and temperature than the blue jet .",
    "we will re - examine the dataset , and analyze the line ratios and physical conditions based on the diagnostic approach developed in @xcite for the x - wind jets .    as a result ,",
    "the fundamental physical properties of the rw aur a system may appear asymmetric .",
    "mass - loss and momentum rates will be asymmetric when they are inferred from the measured asymmetric radial velocities , jet widths , and the electron densities obtained from line ratios @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that if similar physical conditions had been adopted , the red jet would carry one half of the mass loss and one third of the momentum rates carried in the blue jet .",
    "the imbalance of momentum may cause dynamical effects , such as recoil .",
    "@xcite calculated an upper bound 8kms@xmath4 for the recoil , under the assumption that the imbalance persisted during all the pre - main sequence lifetime of the star .",
    "they stated that this recoil value is probably a gross overestimate , because it is possible that earlier accretion of mass into the star might have been more symmetric , or that linear momentum balance might have been maintained over time .",
    "the dynamical time of these jets ( @xmath20 years or less ) is relatively short , diminishing the reasons to expect an imbalance persistent during the total of the pre - main sequence phase ( about @xmath21 years ) .",
    "@xcite revised the calculation by independently deriving electron densities and ionization fractions from each side , and derived similar mass - loss rates for the two sides .",
    "they attributed the asymmetry to inhomogeneous ambient material or to the magnetic configurations .",
    "either work , @xcite or @xcite , leaves the momentum unbalanced in the presence of the observed velocity asymmetry . in this paper",
    ", we will undertake similar analyses based on the same _",
    "hst_/stis dataset used in previous works , and demonstrate that the basic jet properties should be balanced in spite of the observed asymmetries in velocity and mass loss .",
    "the x - wind framework provides an attractive possibility for models confronting with high - angular resolution observations . through the star - disk interaction ,",
    "the stellar magnetic fields can truncate the disk at the co - rotation radius in steady state , where the field is trapped and pinched toward a small area called the x - region at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the material from the disk can accrete onto the star via a funnel flow along the field lines connecting the inner disk edge and the star .",
    "meanwhile , the excess angular momentum from the star can be transported to the x - region and material can be magnetocentrifugally ejected along the open field lines as the x - wind .",
    "streamlines of the wind flow fan out from the x - region , and gradually collimate along the axis of rotation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the kinematic features of an x - wind through synthetic spectra with broad line widths close to the base of the jet which narrow to a profile of single velocity component upon approaching flow terminal speed .",
    "@xcite self - consistently calculated the ionization and thermal conditions for semi - analytic x - wind solutions , and demonstrated how the excitation conditions can influence the synthetic images as `` optical illusions '' , finding a good match of line ratios from available herbig - haro objects and microjets . based on the works established in @xcite , here we attempt a comparison of the x - wind models with those well - known features of the rw aur a jet .    in this paper , we demonstrate a step by step comparison of the high - angular resolution data with theoretical models generated within the x - wind solutions through the analysis of key observed features .",
    "rw aur a is an excellent candidate for such purposes due to its characteristic single high - velocity feature that simplifies the modeling . in section 2 the analysis of _",
    "hst_/stis archival data is addressed , and our parallel procedures for producing synthetic observable quantities from the models are presented .",
    "the observed properties of the jet extracted from the data : i.e. , images , position - velocity diagrams , and the line ratios are discussed in  3.1 .",

    "finally the interpretation of these unusual features of rw aur a are discussed in the theoretical framework based on the x - winds in section 4 .",

    "a @xmath22 slit was used with the g750 m grating .",
    "the slit was displaced at a step of 007 parallel to the jet axis at seven different positions , creating a total field of view of about 05 across the jet .",
    "each exposure produced a two - dimensional spectral image of 52  long in the spatial axis and 6295 to 6867   in the dispersion axis , covering the seven brightest emission lines : [ o i ] @xmath23 , @xmath24 , [ n ii ] @xmath25 , @xmath26 , [ s ii ] @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and h@xmath16 .",

    "the trends delineated by the theoretical curves capture the major features well up to locations where the observed knots become too faint . for the redshifted jet ,",
    "the model profiles go through the average of the knot peaks and off - knot regions ; in the blueshifted jet , the same holds for the intensity profiles , although for the image widths and velocity centroids , the curves go through more scattered points except for the [ s ii ] @xmath98 .",
    "the image widths increase gradually with distance as the overall intensity profiles decrease gradually along the axes .",
    "this is expected as the electron fraction overall follows a pattern of recombination pointed out by @xcite and sgsl .",
    "the similarities and differences in the cross line - ratio diagrams between the synthetic maps and the actual data reveal the degree to which the physical conditions are reproduced by the model parameters .",
    "figure [ comparelr ] shows the line ratios between [ n ii ] @xmath17/[o i ] @xmath9 and [ s ii ] @xmath15/[o i ] @xmath9 , and between [ s ii ] @xmath38 and [ s ii ] @xmath15/[o i ] @xmath9 overlaid by model coverage ( in color shades ) .",

    "the model points extend to about @xmath99 , corresponding roughly to the spatial coverage of the central three slits .",
    "the shaded areas generated by the synthetic images encompass most of the observed data points ( in discrete symbols ) , following similar trends , up to the tips of the knots , b4 and r7 . the overall ratio of [ n ii ] @xmath17/[o i ] @xmath9 is about twice as large in the blue jet as in the red jet . as shown in figure [ xetplot ] , the overall electron fraction of the blue wind is approximately twice as large as in the red wind .",
    "the spatial dependence of [ s ii ] @xmath15/[o i ] @xmath9 varies with the differences in critical densities in [ s ii ] @xmath15 and in [ o i ] @xmath9 , and the [ s ii ] doublet ratio varies across the jet as @xmath100 decreases faster laterally than longitudinally in the model .",
    "the combination of @xmath101 in figure [ xetplot ] following our selection criteria of the solutions indeed captures the overall sense of differences and asymmetry found on the opposite sides of the jet .",
    "the differences in excitation conditions within the opposite jet components differentiate the distribution of data points on the respective line ratio diagrams .",
    "our synthetic points are distributed over a wider area than the observed points .",
    "this is because a large area is covered by fainter pixels on the computational domain .",
    "this is especially noticeable for the brighter red jet .",
    "the model points come from the equivalent area covered by the central three slits as small pixels .",
    "emission from these theoretical pixels is excited ideally by the model approach outlined in  2.2 .",
    "as each of the theoretical pixels contributes to the model line - ratio points , there may not be corresponding points from the observed data .",
    "this is because the actual jets are knottier than the model ones and some of the jet volume in real space is not sufficiently excited as in the model counterpart .",
    "this explains why the model naturally predicts a broader range of values in line ratios while the observed range is narrower because observations are naturally weighted toward the regions with strong emission . on the other hand , the observed data for the blue jet have much higher uncertainties because the jet itself is weaker in emission but faster in flow speed , which may result in a wider spread in physical conditions to begin with .",
    "however , a rough trend can still be traced as in the left panel of figure [ obslr ] , when all the slits are added to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . in this case ,",
    "an overall match in the global trends are what we are seeking in the process .",
    "we also note here that model points from the equivalent of three central slits have already covered most of the regions where emission lines are excited . adding",
    "the emitting area of two more slits outside of the central area does not produce significant increase of the emission .",
    "rather , the additional emitting area will mostly contribute to points with lower [ o i ] @xmath9 emission , resulting in higher [ s ii ] @xmath15/[o i ] @xmath9 and [ n ii ] @xmath17/[o i ] @xmath9 ratios , and [ s ii ] doublet ratios approaching unity . these points may not be sensitively sampled compared to the brighter points represented by the observed data .",
    "we have attempted to re - analyze the set of archived _",
    "hst_/stis data previously analyzed and published in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar results were reached in general , although with some noticeable differences in terms of inferred physical quantities .",
    "our methods of data analysis differ from those adopted in @xcite , but are mostly similar to those adopted in @xcite .",
    "@xcite included further noise subtraction and correction of @xmath102 throughout the jet .",
    "the remaining noise in our data could introduce more scatter for the line ratios in the blue jet , but the overall values are consistent since the line ratios in adjacent wavelengths can mitigate the effect of extinction to @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "they also adopted a higher radial velocity for rw aur a ( @xmath54 kms@xmath4 ) than the averaged value ( @xmath36 kms@xmath4 ) . as expected , the line properties are nearly identical apart from the systematic velocity shift . on the results from archived data ,",
    "the overall properties one would infer in general from the opposite sides of the jet are not altered by different approaches and assumptions .",
    "the physical conditions derived from the different diagnostic analyses , rather than the methods of data analysis , distinguish the various works based on the same set of data .",
    "@xcite derived the physical quantities using techniques developed by @xcite for the individual jet without making _ a priori _ assumptions of the fainter blue jet as in @xcite .",
    "@xcite reached the conclusion that the blue jet is less dense and more excited than the red jet .",
    "the abundances of the atomic and ionic species involved are somewhat different , which may contribute to theoretical line intensities and ratios through the combination of electron density , ionization fraction , and temperature . comparing the physical conditions derived from our self - consistent approaches ( figures [ nevpplot ] and [ xetplot ] ) and those derived from diagnostic mapping by employing the",
    "be technique ( table 1 of @xcite ) , we note differences in values and relative trends . for example , electron densities derived from the be technique are lower in the red jet by 20% .",
    "the faintness of the blue jet introduces larger uncertainties in line ratios and in the derived electron densities .",
    "values derived from the [ s ii ] doublet may also represent a lower limit due to its low critical density ( @xmath104 @xmath105 ) .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ nevpplot ] that values for both jets are similar in the densest region , but they decrease faster in the cylindrical distance @xmath92 in the blue . from the ionization fraction and temperature , both works concluded that the blue jet is the more heated and ionized , and the temperatures derived from the be technique are typically 50% higher than those found in this work .",
    "the higher temperature may compensate for the lower inferred electron densities for the observed line intensities .",
    "the re - heating of the jet close to knot positions may raise the values locally .",
    "the derived ionization fraction from @xcite is in line with our values at the innermost streamlines where x - ray irradiation is the strongest ( figure [ xetplot ] ) .",
    "the hydrogen density that is derived by dividing the electron density with the electron fraction , may weight toward the lower value , leading to mass - loss rates that could be lower by an order of magnitude ( see below ) .",
    "physical properties such as the mass - loss rates inferred for the opposite sides of the jet are the best tests for the dynamical models and diagnostic analyses developed and integrated for the models .",
    "our best - fit mass - loss rate for the red jet , is in line with that found in @xcite using line ratios , and those found in @xcite and @xcite using forbidden line intensities .",
    "these values are of the same order as those in @xcite , but one order of magnitude larger than those derived by @xcite . the small value in @xcite lies in their consideration of `` intrinsic '' image widths .",
    "although the jet radii appear more accurate , the mass loss carried by the associated wide - angle wind is not taken into account .",
    "it is also possible that the electron densities derived from [ s ii ] doublet may represent a lower limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the imbalance of momentum deduced from the ratio of mass - loss rates between the two sides of the jet is larger in @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite obtained line - of - sight velocity , @xmath106 , and jet width , @xmath107 , from the same dataset , and derived electron densities @xmath100 from the [ s ii ] line ratio .",
    "they inferred a mass - loss rate @xmath108 , where electron fraction @xmath94 of the red jet was adopted from @xcite , and the values in the blue jet were assumed to be similar to those in the red jet .",
    "they also assumed similar [ n ii ] @xmath17/[o i ] @xmath9 ratios for both sides , which led to an estimate of a mass - loss rate ratio @xmath109 ( blue to red ) .",
    "similarly , a ratio of @xmath110 is derived for the momentum .",
    "@xcite interpreted this as a temporary phenomenon during accretion since there was no recoil velocity detected . yet",
    "the discrepancy may be resolved if the adopted @xmath94 is 2 to 3 times higher in the blue jet , then the ratio of momentum rates from the two sides would be , @xmath111 , after correcting the ratio of electron fraction .",
    "in addition , their analysis of the emitted fluxes gave mass - loss rates that decrease by more than one order of magnitude within a distance of 2 , which they interpreted as a decrease in mass loss due to sideway push at internal working surfaces .",
    "although they also acknowledged the possibility of a decrease in electron fraction and a reduction of excitation , they left the unbalanced mass - loss and momentum rates unsolved .",
    "our method self - consistently calculates the physical properties that best match the overall line intensities and line ratios , not biased toward only the inner dense part , leading to a better estimate of the mass - loss rates and a general balance of linear momentum .",
    "the `` excess '' redshifted emission at the stellar position on the approaching side is difficult to assess due to subtraction artifacts of the stellar continuum . @xcite and",
    "@xcite pointed out the high - velocity features of the rw aur jet in [ fe ii ] @xmath81.644  at a velocity resolution @xmath112 kms@xmath4 : narrow line widths at the jet proper , symmetric profiles at each position , and increasing line widths toward the source , in general supports the predicted pv diagrams shown in ssg , rather than the disk - wind models . on the other hand , they also commented that the original pv diagrams for an approaching x - wind jet shown in ssg perhaps carry some `` excess '' redshifted emission extending over the stellar position toward the counter side . @xcite",
    "suggested stronger heating ( or re - heating ) at larger distance may resolve the discrepancy .",
    "the wide - angle wind would inevitably possess streamlines that contribute to the redshifted line - of - sight velocity , if the system is not strictly pole - on .",
    "we followed ssg and sgsl for the calculations of the line emissivities .",
    "the so - called `` excess '' is less pronounced in our maps generated for rw aur a parameters with self - consistent excitation conditions implemented , when compared to the original pv diagrams in ssg that were produced with uniform temperature and ionization throughout the wind .",
    "this might suggest that the inner streamlines in our system might have been slightly more excited than the wind case inside the rw aur a system .",
    "with 01 spatial resolution of _ hst _ , the emission is restricted to the stellar position within one resolution element , and this area is strongly affected by the artifact introduced by stellar baseline subtraction in a rectified two - dimensional stis spectra ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is very difficult to assess the actual `` excess '' of the redshifted emission .",
    "we have demonstrated the existence of a pair of x - wind solutions that could capture the major features of asymmetry in the rw aur a system .",
    "the asymmetric properties reported in the literature and the archival _",
    "data are confirmed by our analyses .",
    "mass - loss rates that are required to best match the overall trends in the emission profiles and line ratios are also asymmetric : @xmath113yr@xmath4 for the blue , and @xmath114yr@xmath4 for the red .",
    "these two mass - loss rates give a ratio of @xmath115 .",
    "multiplied by the asymmetric terminal velocity ratio , @xmath116 , we reach a ratio of linear momenta @xmath117 .",
    "this suggests that momentum ejected into the opposite hemispheres is indeed balanced .",
    "this is in contrast to the apparent dilemma of unbalanced momenta carried by the two jets from the velocity asymmetry reported in @xcite and @xcite . despite the asymmetry in velocity , line intensities , and mass - loss rates ,",
    "the system is on average balanced for the most important physical quantity .",
    "the apparent unequal mass - loading and the uneven terminal velocities in the northern and southern hemispheres of rw aur a do not break the law of conservation for linear momenta and magnetic fluxes contributed in the wind in our study .",
    "these major physical quantities are indeed conserved in the average sense across the opposite jets . from the analysis of emission lines originating from the jet alone",
    ", the conservation is an integral part of the original scenario and framework laid out in the original works of the x - wind models @xcite , and there is no need to invoke asymmetry beyond the immediate wind proper .",
    "there is also no obvious detectable precession or signatures from precession of the jet that would suggest a non - alignment of the magnetic axis with the rotation axis on the physical and time scales of the existing datasets .",
    "however , we can not rule out other possibilities from the star itself or processes of the star - disk interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "if the timescales of variation are short , effects of asymmetry originating deep in the star system might have been averaged over the rotation periods and long flow time so the visual effects on the large scale are small .",
    "further clues along these lines supported by other observational evidence will be discussed in a follow - up investigation .      in this work",
    ", we demonstrated the possibilities of finding a match between the x - wind models and the _ hst_/stis spectra of the rw aur a jet , and discussed additional properties that were inferred from such a matching process .",
    "although the existence of such a set of solutions does not constrain a unique launch point @xmath60 , the overall procedure suggests that general features of the x - wind models indeed match those obtained from the data analysis .",
    "in particular , the mass - loss rates and excitation properties not only fall nicely within the general range suggested by the data but also solve the puzzling asymmetry in the physical properties of the system . despite such ambiguity",
    ", the general results demonstrated in this work should exist in any model that is to be selected should a different combination using another @xmath60 provides a good fit with the detailed properties .",
    "the differences should be within a factor of two of what we learned in this work .",
    "current available observational data on the rw aur a jet alone do not seem to be able to resolve the ambiguity .",
    "observational clues or constraints derived near the base of the jet related to the inner truncation radii of the disk , or some other information inferred from the permitted lines originating in the accretion funnels may help resolve the uncertainties .",
    "inner truncation radii of the rw aur a disk from near - infrared interferometry @xcite have a range of 0.08 to 0.2 au , consistent with fits of models with dust sublimation temperature between 1000 to 1500 k. the gas disk may extend to 0.02 to 0.05 au @xcite inside of the dust disk although the actual values may be dependent on the underlying disk models adopted .",
    "these are all well within the considerations of choices for @xmath60 given in this paper ( tables [ seti ] and [ setii ] ) .",
    "recent zeeman - splitting measurement of optical emission lines can help to qualitatively infer the magnetic structure of the interaction region between the star and the disk @xcite .",
    "the averaged longitudinal magnetic field strength @xmath118 inferred from the narrow component of he  i  @xmath119 was found to change polarity within one rotation period assuming @xmath120 days .",
    "it is consistent with a model proposed in @xcite that the variation of the lines is due to two hot spots on opposite poles of the star .",
    "the co - rotation radius corresponding to this period is @xmath121 au assuming @xmath122 .",
    "while this is still within our considerations , it may also be possible that the disk truncation radius ( @xmath123 ) does not always coincide with the co - rotation radius .",
    "in the picture of a fluctuating x - wind @xcite , @xmath124 , the magnetic energy released would be proportional to the difference in angular frequency , and part of it can be in x - rays . in this case , we know that the x - ray activities may affect the initial ionization of the flow and properties of the lines . simultaneous monitoring in both the x - rays and photospheric and forbidden emission will be desirable to understand the star - disk interaction in the rw aur a system .",
    "we have presented detailed analyses and comparisons between the _ hst_/stis archival data and synthetic spectra from the x - wind models for the bipolar jet of rw aur a. we analyzed properties of optical forbidden lines [ o i ] , [ n ii ] , and [ s ii ] through pv diagrams , images , and line ratios .",
    "pv diagrams of all the lines show similar kinematic features , and an average blue - to - red velocity ratio of @xmath53 .",
    "spectra of high spatial resolution enable diagnostics for both jets through the line ratios .",
    "we were able to identify general properties related to the asymmetry of physical conditions derived through the line ratios , and applied them as constraints for model comparisons .",
    "the diagnostic approach developed in sgsl was extended and applied to rw aur a , using parameters for the stellar mass , radius , systemic velocity , and inclination angles of the jet and disk . within observational uncertainties",
    ", we could select a set of stellar parameters to demonstrate a sample fitting process for illustration .",
    "parameters were searched for mass - loss rates , x - ray luminosities , and mechanical heating starting from the fiducial models adopted in @xcite for a pair of x - wind solutions that were selected by matching the velocity ratio .",
    "the combined models not only possess the feature of asymmetry in jet speeds , but also simultaneously meet the overall agreement in line intensities , image widths , and line ratios .    our interpretation of the rw aur a system offers a different perspective to the driving of the asymmetric jets .",
    "since its discovery , the asymmetry in the opposite sides of the bipolar jet has intrigued astronomers for many years .",
    "previous analysis of the same stis dataset suggested a nearly equal mass - loss rate in the opposite jets themselves but with asymmetry in the ambient environment @xcite . through the demonstration of a sample fit with the x - wind models , we are able to interpret the asymmetry in velocity and intensity as a consequence of different mass loading on the opposite sides of the disk while the system adjusting itself to conserve linear momentum .",
    "moreover , our analysis suggests the jet and wide - angle wind system as a whole is one entity , since observational interpretation through the optical lines alone would not recover the entirety of mass loss inside the hemisphere .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate that the framework of x - winds can accommodate many general features of asymmetric disk - jet systems such as rw aur a. analysis such as one presented here may be applied to other similar systems",

    "<S> in this paper , the rw aur a microjet is studied from the point of view of x - wind models . the archived _ hst_/stis spectra of optical forbidden lines [ o  i ] , [ s  ii ] , and [ n  ii ] from rw aur a , taken in cycle 8 with seven parallel slits along the jet axis , spaced at 007 apart , were analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> images , position - velocity diagrams , and line ratios among the species were constructed , and compared with synthetic observations generated by selected solutions of the x - wind . </S>",
    "<S> prominent features arising in a steady - state x - wind could be identified within the convolved images , full - widths at half maxima and high - velocity peaks on both of the redshifted and blueshifted jets . </S>",
    "<S> the well - known asymmetric velocity profiles of the opposite jets are built into the selected models . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss model selections within the existing uncertainties of stellar parameters and inclination angle of the system . in this framework , the mass - loss rates that were inferred to be decreasing along the jet axis in the literature are the results of slowly decreasing excitation conditions and electron density profiles . despite the apparent asymmetry in terminal velocities , line intensities and mass - loss rates , the average linear momenta from the opposite sides of the jet are actually balanced . </S>",
    "<S> these previously hard - to - explain features of the asymmetric rw aur a jet system now find a different but self - consistent interpretation within the x - wind framework . </S>"
