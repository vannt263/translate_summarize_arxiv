    "e.      while both gapped and gapless superconductors are perfect conductors of charge , their thermal conductance is markedly different .",
    "transport calculations are performed by connecting the system to disorder free leads at temperatures @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and computing the scattering matrix , @xmath83 between any two leads , a and b. this enables us to determine the thermal conductance in the low - temperature , linear response regime , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the quantum of thermal conductance .",
    "all transport simulations are performed using the kwant code @xcite .",
    "conventional topological superconductors have a gapped bulk , such that the thermal conductance is only due to edge state transport . in contrast",
    ", the model introduced in the main text has both bulk and edge excitations at the fermi level , so both contribute to the conductance .",
    "in order to separate the bulk and edge contributions , we perform transport simulations in a three - terminal setup , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 3terminal ] . by subtracting the conductance between any two leads from that in the reverse direction ( @xmath86 for instance ) , we obtain the chiral contribution to transport , which in this model is only due to the edge states .",
    "transport through the bulk and edge may also be determined by comparing the conductance of a system when changing from hard - wall to periodic boundary conditions , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    "however , different lattice terminations independently change the chirality of the edge states , and result in the formation of a spurious conducting channel when periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "hence , for a typical termination , the difference in conductance between systems with hard - wall and periodic boundary conditions contains contribution from both the edge and the bulk .",
    "therefore , this setup can not be used for all the possible terminations .",
    "the three - terminal setup of fig .",
    "[ 3terminal ] overcomes this problem , while being less prone to finite - size effects , since boundary conditions are kept fixed . additionally , unlike the periodic boundary conditions technique , it has the advantage of modeling an experimentally accessible scenario .",
    "the dependence of the strong edge states on the magnetic termination may be understood intuitively from the small @xmath21 limit .",
    "it was shown by sau _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , that the combination of a rashba spin - orbit coupling , s - wave superconducting pairing , @xmath20 , and a uniform zeeman field , @xmath1 , leads to a two - dimensional class @xmath0 topological superconductor with a well defined chern number .",
    "the value of the chern number is @xmath87 for @xmath88 and zero for @xmath89 . in the limit of small @xmath21 , the hamiltonian of eqs .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) in the main text can be locally thought of as a system subjected to a uniform zeeman field .",
    "thus , we can think about the system in real space as stripes of superconductors , with alternating chern numbers , connected in parallel .",
    "edge states flow where the chern numbers change . ignoring the gapped bulk states of each stripe",
    ", we may view the system as a collection of one dimensional chiral majorana channels ( see an illustration in fig .  [ small_q ] ) .",
    "we assume only a nearest neighbors coupling between these chiral channels , such that channels with the same chirality are coupled by @xmath90 ( symmetric coupling ) and that channels with an opposite chirality are coupled by @xmath91 ( anti - symmetric coupling ) , and obtain the two dimensional band - structure of the system .",
    "if the symmetric coupling is the dominant coupling , i.e. , @xmath92 , each two neighboring majorana channels with similar chirality form a single fermionic chiral channel . coupling fermionic channels with an alternating chirality through a coupling @xmath91 leads to a gapless phase with two dirac cones in the two dimensional brillouin zone . then",
    ", the gapless bulk states in our original model can be understood as the band structure emerging from @xmath92 .",
    "the strong edge states are then a remnant of the channels near the edge , and their nature depend periodically on the termination . consistently with our findings in the main part of the manuscript , the chirality of the edge states in this picture also depends periodically on the termination and changes sign with a period of two stripes .    adding a uniform zeeman field on top of this picture leads to an asymmetry between regions with different chern numbers .",
    "depending on the sign of the zeeman field , the size of the regions with a given chern number increases while size of the regions with the opposite chern number decreases . in the picture of the one dimensional chiral channels ,",
    "this can be thought of as dimerization of channels .",
    "hence , a single chern number prevails in the system .",
    "it should be pointed out that we provided this cartoon model solely as an intuition .",
    "although the model in the main text shows similar features to the cartoon model , it can not be extrapolated from the the small @xmath93 picture , since the real space picture in fig .",
    "[ small_q ] breaks down as @xmath93 becomes comparable to @xmath94 .",

    "<S> blue points denote bulk states and other colors denote the right edge state . </S>",
    "<S> the left edge state is fixed in the @xmath47 termination and is not shown . </S>",
    "<S> both the dispersion and the chirality of the edge state change as the termination changes , but the chirality remains non - zero , at zero energy , as long as particle - hole symmetry is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> notice that for two terminations the edge states cross the fermi level three times , once at @xmath51 and twice , with an opposite velocity , close to the bulk nodes . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the chiralty is determined by the edge states at the vicinity of the bulk nodes .    </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the dependence of the edge modes chirality and their contribution to the thermal conductance on both edge orientation and lattice termination by performing transport simulations . </S>",
    "<S> using a three - terminal geometry , we separate bulk and edge contributions to transport , as described in appendix  a. this can be done both in the clean limit as well as in the presence of disorder , which we model as a spatial variation of the chemical potential in eq .  , drawn independently for each lattice site from the uniform distribution @xmath52 $ ] , with @xmath53 being the disorder strength . in the presence of weak disorder , the chiral edge states contribution is slightly reduced due to the hybridization of the edge modes with the bulk . for moderate disorder , the edge states at finite momenta hybridize strongly with the bulk nodes , as opposed to the edge states at small momenta . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , beyond a certain disorder strength , the edge states around zero momentum dominate the transport , leading to a unique inversion of the edge state chirality ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b ) induced by disorder . as the disorder strength is further increased , all edge state contributions go to zero as the system enters a thermal metal phase .    in the clean case , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the strong edge states to the thermal conductance becomes quantized in the thermodynamic limit as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a shows . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the contribution of the weak edge states vanishes as a function of system size , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between the edge and bulk states depends on the normal and superconducting parameters of the model and therefore can not be independently tuned . </S>",
    "<S> the energy scales that correspond to these parameters are large compared to the topological gap scale , @xmath54 , and therefore the weak edge states hybridize effectively .    in the presence of a uniform zeeman field @xmath1 , the dependence on the termination disappears and the chirality is determined solely by the sign of @xmath1 . in appendix  b , we provide an illustrative model aiming to intuitively explain the dependance on the lattice termination . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eqjfourierspace ] ) we find that when the lattice constant of the magnetic moments exceeds @xmath63 , the rkky interaction strongly depends on the impurity lattice structure and on the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to engineer the momenta at which the rkky interaction is peaked , as we exemplify for different lattice structures in appendix  d. for lattice constants smaller than @xmath63 however , the rkky interaction is not significantly altered by the choice of the lattice . in this regime </S>",
