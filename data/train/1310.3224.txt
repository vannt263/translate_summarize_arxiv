    "droplets with different initial contact angles are achieved by depositing droplets of larger or smaller volume and emptying / filling these on the surface to the desired 50 @xmath0l . emptying results in contact angles closer to the receding angle , whereas filling results in contact angles closer to the advancing angle . if necessary",
    ", vibration can be used to achieve the most stable contact angle on the given surface , which will be roughly half - way the advancing and receding angles .    when tilted the front or rear contact point of the droplet will move first , depending on the initial state of the droplet . when tilted close to the roll - off angle and then returned to horizontal the base length of all droplets , regardless of their initial shape ,",

    "all droplets are distilled water of milliq quality and have a volume of 50 @xmath0l .",
    "the surface consists of a 4-inch silicon wafer coated with a 10 micron layer of pdms ( sylgard ) in 5:1 ratio with the curing agent .",
    "this results in advancing and receding contact angles of 119 and 92 degrees respectively .",
    "the substrate is tilted at a rate of 0.25@xmath1 ."
