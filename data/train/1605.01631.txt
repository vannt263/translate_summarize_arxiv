    "thanks to the efforts of babar and belle collaborations in the past years , most of the @xmath9 mesons decays with branching fractions @xmath10 have been measured . with the particle physics entering the lhc era ,",

    "in addition , most recently , the upgrading superkekb / belle - ii experiment has started test operations and succeeded in circulating and storing beams in the electron and positron rings .",
    "so , in the near future , the measurements of @xmath11 meson decays are expected to reach unprecedented precision , which will provide a much more fertile ground for testing the flavor picture of the standard model  ( sm ) and exploring underlying mechanisms . for the nonleptonic two - body @xmath11 meson decays , the theoretical evaluation is generally complicated due to the nontrivial qcd dynamics related to the hadronic final states . in order to evaluate the strong interaction corrections to the amplitude , several attractive qcd - inspired approaches , including qcd factorization  ( qcdf )  @xcite , the pqcd approach  @xcite and the soft - collinear effective theory  ( scet )  @xcite , have been presented . for the case of two light final states ,",
    "the theoretical evaluations with qcdf approach have been fully developed in the heavy quark limit , for instance refs .",
    "for the case of heavy - light final states , such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 _ et al .",
    "_ , the calculation is generally much more complicated due to the un - negligible @xmath15 quark mass . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the factorization formula at two - loop order has been proven , and the explicit results of qcd corrections for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and longitudinally polarized @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 are light pseudoscalar and vector mesons , respectively ) decays have been presented .",
    "the @xmath22 induced nonleptonic @xmath11 decays , which are tree - dominated and ckm - favored , have relatively large branching fractions and have been widely studied in various theoretical frameworks , for instance refs .",
    "@xcite . in the previous works for the @xmath23 decays based on the qcdf , the qcd corrections to the longitudinal amplitude have been fully evaluated at next - to - leading order  ( nlo )  @xcite and next - to - next - to - leading order  ( nnlo )  @xcite . even though the @xmath23 decays are dominated by the longitudinally polarized final states , to keep fairness and consistence , the power - suppressed transverse amplitudes",
    "should also be calculated to the same order as the longitudinal one , which is also essential for relatively accurate theoretical results , especially for the polarization fractions .",
    "that is what we would like to do in this paper .",
    "moreover , due to the refined experimental measurements , it is also worth performing detailed phenomenological analyses and testing whether the data and the theoretical results are in agreement .",
    "in addition to @xmath11 mesons , their excited states , such as @xmath24 mesons with quantum number of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , also could decay through the same transitions as @xmath11 mesons at quark level .",

    "after high - luminosity upgrade , a data sample of @xmath255 will be collected by lhcb collaboration at a much higher @xmath256 , which results in a further enhancement of @xmath257 production by a factor about 2  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the most of @xmath11 mesons detected at lhc are mainly produced through @xmath148 decays because @xmath24 mesons are often produced by about 3 times more than the @xmath11 mesons  @xcite .",
