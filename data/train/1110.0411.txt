    "in recent years , several unexpected astrophysical observations have failed to find a common interpretation in terms of standard astrophysical or particle physics sources .",
    "a non - exhaustive list of these observations includes the 511 kev gamma - ray signal from the galactic center observed by the integral satellite @xcite , the excess in the cosmic ray positrons reported by pamela  @xcite , the total electron and positron flux measured by atic  @xcite , fermi  @xcite , and hess @xcite , the annual modulation of the dama / libra signal  @xcite and the low energy spectrum of nuclear recoil candidate events observed by cogent @xcite .",
    "although there are alternative explanations for some of these anomalies , they could be all explained with the existence of a dark matter weakly interacting massive particle , wimp , belonging to a secluded gauge sector under which the standard model ( sm ) particles are uncharged @xcite .",
    "an abelian gauge field , the @xmath1 boson with mass near the gev scale , couples the secluded sector to the sm through its kinetic mixing with the sm hyper - charge gauge field .",
    "the kinetic mixing parameter , @xmath11 , is expected to be of the order 10@xmath1210@xmath13 @xcite , so that observable effects can be induced in @xmath14)energy @xmath15 colliders @xcite and fixed target experiments @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of a new light boson gauging a new symmetry with a small coupling was in fact already introduced on general grounds in @xcite , and rediscussed in models postulating also the existence of light spin 0 or 1/2 dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "this boson can have both vector and axial - vector couplings to quark and leptons , however axial couplings are strongly constrained by data , leaving room to vector couplings only .    the @xmath1 boson can be produced at  colliders via different processes : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18-strahlung ) , where @xmath18 is a higgs - like particle responsible for the breaking of the hidden symmetry , and @xmath19 decays , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are vector and pseudoscalar mesons , respectively . in this work ,",
    "we study the process @xmath22 , using a sample of @xmath23 mesons produced resonantly at the da@xmath0ne  collider .",
    "the @xmath1 boson can be observed by its decay into a lepton pair , while the @xmath24 can be tagged by one of its main decays .",
    "an irreducible background due to the dalitz decay of the @xmath23 meson , @xmath25 , is present .",
    "this decay has been studied by the snd and cmd-2 experiments , which measured a branching fraction of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a cross section of @xmath28 nb , with a di - lepton mass range @xmath29 mev .",
    "for the signal , the expected cross section is expressed by @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 transition form factor evaluated at the @xmath1 mass while the following term represents the ratio of the kinematic functions of the involved decays.^2 -   4 m_1 ^ 2 m_3 ^ 2/(m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2)^2 $ ] . ] using @xmath33 and @xmath34 , a cross section @xmath35 is obtained . despite the small ratio between the overall cross section of @xmath2 and @xmath25 , their different di - lepton invariant mass distributions allow to test the @xmath11 parameter down to @xmath36 with the kloe data set .",
    "the best @xmath1 decay channel to search for the @xmath2 process at kloe is in @xmath15 , since a wider range of @xmath1 boson masses can be tested and @xmath37 are easily identified using a time - of - flight ( tof ) technique .",
    "the @xmath24 can be tagged by the three - pion or two - photon final state , which represent @xmath38 of the total decay rate .",
    "we have used the @xmath39 decay channel , which provides a clean final state with four charged particles and two photons .",

    "equal energy positron and electron beams collide at an angle of @xmath41 - 25 mrad , producing @xmath23 mesons nearly at rest .",
    "the detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber ( dc ) , surrounded by a lead - scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) . a superconducting coil around the emc provides a 0.52  t field .",

    "a cosmic veto rejects events with at least two energy deposits above 30 mev in the outermost calorimeter layer .",
    "data are then analyzed by an event classification filter @xcite , which selects and streams various categories of events in different output files .",
