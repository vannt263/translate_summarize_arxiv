    "compressive sensing ( cs ) @xcite has successfully shown that a small number of measurements , obtained through a suitable sensing matrix , is able to acquire a sparse signal and enable its exact recovery from its measurements .",
    "remarkably , knowledge of the sparsity basis is not explicitly needed at the moment of acquisition , but only for recovery . since the beginnings of cs , it was clear that working in the compressed domain presented advantages in terms of complexity because many tasks do not really require recovery but rather to solve inference problems . the seminal paper by davenport _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on signal processing with compressive measurements provided techniques to perform detection , classification , estimation and interference cancellation tasks . in this paper , we focus on a different , although similar , problem .",
    "the goal is to perform classical signal processing operations such as filtering , interpolation and others directly on the compressive measurements , thereby avoiding to first apply the computationally expensive reconstruction algorithms in order to later apply the operator on the reconstructed samples .",
    "the resulting operation is a measurement - to - measurement transformation , which takes as input the acquired measurements and outputs the measurements of the processed signal , without ever performing reconstruction .",
    "this is achieved by using a circulant sensing matrix , or a distributed circulation property in single node and multi - node scenarios respectively .",
    "conversely , [ 2 ] is concerned with parameter estimation from the measurements .",
    "this can also be applied to the estimation of transform or filtered coefficients , but the estimate is always affected by some error , whereas our proposed method yields an exact solution .",
    "we use the subscript @xmath0}$ ] to denote a submatrix of @xmath1 composed by the rows indexed by interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the subscript @xmath3 denotes a circular shift to the right ( downwards for column vectors ) by @xmath4 positions .    in the standard cs framework , introduced in @xcite , a signal @xmath5 which has a sparse representation in some basis @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath7 , can be recovered by a smaller vector @xmath8 , @xmath9 , of linear measurements @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the _ sensing matrix_. the optimum solution , seeking the sparsest vector compliant with @xmath12 , is an np - hard problem , but one can resort to a convex optimization reconstruction problem by minimizing the @xmath13 norm , provided enough measurements ( @xmath14 ) are available .",
    "this algorithm is robust when it is used to reconstruct signals which are not exactly sparse , but rather compressible , meaning that the magnitude of their sorted coefficients ( in some basis @xmath15 ) decays exponentially .",
    "the most used sensing matrices in the literature are random matrices whose elements are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variables .",
    "however , circulant matrices have been recently proposed @xcite@xcite because they can be implemented easily or arise naturally in various problems .",
    "circulant matrices have been shown to be as effective as gaussian sensing matrices , when the signal is acquired in its sparsity domain and have a slightly reduced performance otherwise @xcite .",

    "the classic filtering operation consists in convolving the filter impulse response with the signal , and circular convolution can be used if periodic boundary conditions are considered .",
    "this amounts to taking the product between a square circulant matrix @xmath22 and the signal of interest .",
    "it can be observed that square circulant matrices form a commutative group with respect to matrix product , hence if we used a square circulant sensing matrix @xmath27 we would have @xmath28 .",
    "cs uses rectangular sensing matrices in order to achieve compression , hence @xmath27 is a `` partial '' circulant matrix .",

    "the following theorem shows that obtaining the measurements of a filtered version of the signal is as straightforward as filtering the measurements .",

    "let us describe the principles of operation referring to the former scenario for ease of explanation , but always keeping in mind the latter .    in the multi - node scenario ,",

    "[ thm : ditributed_partial_commutator ] given @xmath48 nodes , the @xmath65-th measurement of the filtered signal at node @xmath55 is @xmath66 if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "we skip the proof for brevity and because it follows that of thm .",
    "[ thm : partial_commutator ] , now using the @xmath58-distributed partial commutator .",
    "the main advantage of this multi - node framework is that each node has a fully random matrix on its own .",
    "therefore , if its number of measurements is sufficiently high , it can perform reconstruction without suffering the slight performance degradation shown by circulant matrices when the sparsity domain is not the identity .",
    "moreover , no measurement is corrupted in this process , except for @xmath31 nodes , which can not compute the filtered measurements with respect to their own sensing matrix . moreover",
    ", multiple nodes can stack their measurements , corresponding to the second scenario discussed at the beginning of the section .",
    "in this case , the resulting sensing matrix would be obtained by stacking the individual sensing matrices , thus having a block - circulant structure ( a total of @xmath17 independent rows , used as seed of @xmath48 circulant blocks ) .",
    "the following sections describe some applications of the presented framework . for reasons of brevity , we shall focus on the single - node case , but",
    "all the results can be readily extended to the multi - node scenario .",
    "the general case of filtering using circular convolution with a sequence @xmath54 has already been treated in the previous section .",
    "the following examples consider problems that can be cast in a similar manner .",
    "it is of interest to apply a discretized differential operator to the signal and compute the measurements of the resulting sequence directly from the original measurements .",
    "let us consider a discretization of the second derivative , so that the @xmath18-th sample in the output is computed , in vector form , as : @xmath68 where the subscript @xmath69 denotes a circular right - shift by @xmath70 positions .",
    "it is easy to check that the measurements @xmath71 can be obtained directly in the compressed domain as : @xmath72 with the corruption of the first measurement . in the multi - node",
    "setting it is immediate to derive that node @xmath55 can request the measurements of nodes @xmath73 and @xmath74 in order to compute @xmath75 directly in the compressed domain : @xmath76 this example is shown in fig .",
    "[ cmp_interpolation ] the objective is to compute the measurements of an interpolated version of the signal of interest from its compressive measurements .",
    "interpolation is modelled as the cascade of an upsampler and a low - pass filter .",
    "therefore it is possible to perform the operation in the compressed domain if we assume that the original signal was acquired by a circulant matrix with a few zeroed columns , whose number depends on the upsampling factor .",
    "the low - pass filter is implemented by the standard compressive filtering technique explained in the previous sections , bearing in mind that @xmath31 measurements will be corrupted . as an example , let us consider a piecewise linear interpolator with an interpolation factor of 2 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the interpolated sequence and the corresponding measurement - domain transformation are : @xmath77 in this example the original measurements have been acquired as @xmath78 , where the @xmath50-th column of @xmath79 is @xmath80 for a given circulant matrix @xmath27 .",
    "the measurements of the interpolated signal with respect to matrix @xmath27 are now available .      the problem of integer shift retrieval in the compressed domain was considered in @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that the test @xmath81 exactly recovers the integer shift @xmath82 from as low as one measurement ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the measurements of the signal and of its shifted version using cyclic shift operator @xmath85 ) , given some conditions on @xmath27 .",
    "the partial fourier matrix was considered as an example of sensing matrix satisfying the prescribed properties .",
    "we notice that circulant matrices do not satisfy the conditions listed in theorem 1 in @xcite ; in particular , @xmath86 for any scaling factor @xmath87 . however , we can exploit theorem [ thm : partial_commutator ] to perform shift retrieval in a different way .",
    "one of the implications of theorem [ thm : partial_commutator ] is that a shift in the signal corresponds to a shift in the measurements by the same amount , being the cyclic shift operator @xmath85 a circulant matrix , with the corruption of @xmath82 measurements .",
    "let @xmath88 be a partial circulant matrix .",
    "let @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "if @xmath91 , then retrieves the correct shift @xmath92 .",

    "let us call @xmath40 the square circulant matrix having the same seed as @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that @xmath100 . if @xmath101 , we have @xmath102}\\mathbf{x}_{\\rightarrow s^\\star } = c_{\\left[1,m - s^\\star \\right]}\\mathbf{x}$ ] , and @xmath103}\\mathbf{x}$ ] , hence @xmath104 , so @xmath105 . if @xmath106 or @xmath107 we have @xmath108}\\mathbf{x}_{\\rightarrow s^\\star } = c_{\\left[s - s^\\star+1,m \\right]}\\mathbf{x}$ ] and @xmath109}^t c_{\\left [ 1,m - s^\\star - s \\right]}^t   \\right]^t \\mathbf{x}$ ] , respectively and @xmath110}\\mathbf{x}$ ] in both cases .",
    "hence , by construction of @xmath111 , we have @xmath112 .",
    "the same reasoning applies for @xmath113 .",
    "thus , we proved retrieval of the correct shift .",
    "when @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 can not be constructed because @xmath115 and @xmath116 contain measurements coming from two disjoint submatrices of c.    notice that thanks to compressive interpolation ( section [ cmp_interpolation ] ) , it is also possible to retrieve sub - integer shifts ; we leave this as future work .",
    "a different problem is registration .",
    "if we know the shift @xmath82 , we can register a signal , meaning that we can compute the measurements of the shifted version simply by shifting the measurement vector .",
    "if want to compute the measurements with respect to the original matrix @xmath27 , then @xmath82 measurements will be corrupted by the registration .",
    "otherwise , we can suppose that the registered measurements are measurements acquired with a different sensing matrix @xmath117 , which is circulant , having as seed the @xmath118-th row of the full circulant matrix , that the partial @xmath27 was extracted from .",
    "we show that it is possible to obtain the measurements of the wavelet coefficients from the measurements of the signal directly in the compressed domain . changing the signal domain after the sensing process can be useful in several ways . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a technique to improve the quality of the reconstruction of signals compressible in the wavelet domain by exploiting the tree - based structure within the wavelet coefficients .",
    "the method requires cs measurements of the wavelet coefficients in order to be applied .",
    "however , in many scenarios it is not practical to sense the wavelet coefficients , either because the sensing is implemented in a low - complexity , low - power hardware so that calculating the transform would be computationally and energetically costly or because specialized hardware directly acquires random projections of the data ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , being able to compute the measurements of the wavelet coefficients , which typically hold a sparse or compressible representation of the signal , allows to recover them directly , thus avoiding any issues regarding the coherence @xcite of sensing matrix and spasifying wavelet dictionary .    in order to implement the wavelet",
    "transform in the compressed domain we exploit the lifting scheme @xcite . the lifting method to compute the wavelet",
    "transform consists in a sequence of lifting steps , each composed by two filters operating on two subsequences .",
    "initially , the two subsequences are the even and odd samples of the signal ; the predict filter is used to predict the odd sequence from the even one , and the difference is then passed through the update filter and the result summed back to the even sequence . it can be noticed that this framework can be mapped in the compressed domain because the filtering steps can be implemented as explained in the previous sections under the choice of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we thus only need to impose a structured sensing that acquires measurements of the even and odd subsequences separately .",
    "let us call @xmath119 and @xmath120 the sensing matrices used to acquire the even and odd subsequences , respectively .",
    "both have size @xmath121 , but the even ( odd ) columns are zeroed in @xmath120 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "moreover , the sum @xmath122 is a circulant matrix .",
    "the measurements of the even and odd sequences form the two input sequences in the compressive scheme , depicted in fig .",
    "3 . the prediction step applies the prediction filter to the even sequence and the output is left - shifted by 1 .",
    "the update step applies the update filter and right - shifts the output by 1 .",
    "this is the structure of a single lifting step , which may be repeated depending on the particular transform to be implemented .",
    "finally , gains are applied and the two sequences are summed .",
    "it can be shown that the final output is @xmath123 being @xmath124 the vector of wavelet coefficients .",
    "we remark that , as explained in section [ sec : singlenode ] , @xmath125 measurements per lifting step are corrupted . in more detail , let us consider a practical example taken from @xcite .",
    "the spline 5/3 biorthogonal transform has the following prediction and update filters @xmath126 and @xmath127 and gain factors @xmath128 , @xmath129 . applying the compressive transform procedure we can obtain the measurements of the wavelet coefficients with a corruption of the first 2 and last 2 measurements , which will be discarded .",
