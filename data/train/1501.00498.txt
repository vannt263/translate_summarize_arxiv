    "pks j0334 - 3900 is located at the centre of the galaxy cluster abell 3135 , as shown in fig .",
    "abell 3135 is found at the northern edge of the horologium - reticulum supercluster , and has a redshift of @xmath3 .",
    "pks j0334 - 3900 is located at the same redshift with @xmath4 .",
    "chandra x - ray observations at 0.7 @xmath5 2 kev show that the icm in abell 3135 is skewed to the southwest .",
    "it is likely that the system is in a late merging stage , and that the merger happened along the sw - ne .",

    "the 1.4 ghz atca observations of pks j0334 - 3900 shows the key features in morphology , the top and bottom jets are bent in the same direction , the jets have hooks towards the ends , and there are knots of intensity at the start of each jet .",
    "additionally , the hook shapes are clearly seen in the magnetic component of the polarized emission . furthermore , it is possible to see the magnetic component curve as it leaves the knot regions . at @xmath7",
    "= 03:34:14 , there is a break in emission in the bottom jet , suggesting the jet is changing direction along the line of slight .",
    "we hypothesized the jets are bent due to a wind in the icm while the hooks are generated from orbital motion around a known companion galaxy combined with precession of the bh .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we created a simulation of pks j0334 - 3900 under the above conditions .",
    "the model of pks j0334 - 3900 consists of symmetric and , to a first approximation , ballistic jets moving at constant speed ( for details , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "as shown in fig . 1 , we find that this model reproduces both the bending in the jets due to the wind in the icm and the hooks due to the orbital motion around a companion galaxy and procession of the bh .",
    "the atca observations at 1.4 ghz were also used to make a rotation measure ( rm ) image of pks j0334 - 3900 .",
    "the average rotation measure in the top and bottom jets are 1.16 and 7.44 rad m@xmath8 , respectively . using the simulation in fig .",
    "1 , we estimated the jet separation to be @xmath9 kpc along our line of sight .",
    "the chandra observation provides an average electron density for the icm of 1.09 @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that the separation between the jets along our line of sight will cause the difference in average rm between the jets . in this case , a lower limit of the average cluster magnetic field is calculated as @xmath11 @xmath2 g .",

    "this work shows that the morphology of the jets in the bent - tailed galaxy pks j0334 - 3900 can be explained by a wind in the icm , precessional and orbital motion and that the combination of the data and simulation can be used to estimate the strength of the cluster magnetic field .",
    "in particular , this work highlights the way in which multi - wavelength observations of radio jets are powerful tools for probing their environments .",
