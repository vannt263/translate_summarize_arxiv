    "a partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) of all antiproton - proton ( @xmath0 ) scattering data below antiproton laboratory momentum @xmath7 mev / c is presented . in the field of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 )",
    "scattering , phase - shift analyses ( more properly called partial - wave analyses , pwas ) have a long history and at present the multienergy or energy - dependent partial - wave analyses of @xmath8 scattering data have reached a stage of considerable sophistication  @xcite . due to the poor quality of low - energy antiproton beams and the resulting absence of accurate experimental data ,",
    "analogous model - independent studies of the much more complex @xmath0 system have in the past always been impossible .    in recent years , however , experimental progress has been very significant , in particular due to the advent in 1983 of the lear facility at cern . in the momentum region",
    "that we consider in the analysis presented in this paper , the situation between 400 and 925 mev / c is quite good : a variety of observables have been measured with impressive accuracy . however , the practical difficulties involved in constructing a high - quality antiproton beam of even lower momentum are large . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath0 database below about 400 mev / c is still by far not as good as one would like  @xcite , in contrast to the case of @xmath8 scattering , where for instance very accurate proton - proton differential cross sections have been taken at energies as low as @xmath9 mev ( @xmath10 mev / c ) .    during the last 10 years",
    "a new method has been developed by the nijmegen group to perform partial - wave analyses of the @xmath8 ( proton - proton and neutron - proton ) scattering data below laboratory kinetic energy @xmath11 mev ( @xmath12 mev / c ) .",
    "the hallmark of this method is that the theoretical knowledge of the @xmath8 interaction is exploited as much as possible in the description of the energy dependence of the partial - wave scattering amplitudes .",
    "this is done by solving the relativistic schrdinger equation for each partial wave and at each energy with the theoretically well - known long - range @xmath8 interaction represented by the potential for @xmath13 fm .",
    "this long - range interaction is responsible for the fast variation with energy of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the much slower energy variations of the amplitudes due to the short - range interactions are parametrized phenomenologically by the energy dependence of a boundary condition at @xmath14 . in this way",
    "one also avoids the complications due to the lack of knowledge of this short - range interaction . in order to achieve a good fit to the @xmath8 data",
    "one has to include in the long - range interaction the complete electromagnetic interaction ( including relativistic and some two - photon  exchange effects , the magnetic - moment interactions , and the vacuum - polarization potential ) , the one - pion  exchange potential , and also the intermediate - range forces ( due to two - pion exchange and/or heavier - meson exchange ) of some realistic @xmath8 potential model .",
    "the dominant feature of @xmath0 scattering at low energies is the annihilation into mesons , a process that has no counterpart in @xmath8 scattering .",
    "annihilation is , in principle , a very complicated spin- , isospin- , and energy - dependent multiparticle process . at rest ,",
    "where kinematically the production of 13 neutral pions is allowed , 5 pions are produced on the average  @xcite , and of the order of 100 two - meson channels contribute significantly  @xcite . in recent years some progress has been made in understanding specific annihilation processes in terms of quark - gluon degrees of freedom . however , for the description of elastic @xmath15 and charge - exchange @xmath16 scattering , only a phenomenological approach to annihilation is feasible at present . in potential models for antinucleon - nucleon ( @xmath17 ) scattering one usually simplifies things drastically by taking the annihilation potential to be completely independent of spin , angular momentum , isospin , and energy .",
    "this assumption is implemented either by applying a simple absorptive boundary condition  @xcite , or by using a state - independent two- or three - parameter optical potential  @xcite . however ,",
    "when one is interested in describing the data quantitatively , including spin - dependent observables , a less naive approach is called for .",
    "for instance , in the paris @xmath17 model  @xcite a spin- , isospin- , and energy - dependent optical potential is employed , and in the nijmegen coupled - channels model  @xcite each @xmath17 channel is coupled to two effective two - body mesonic channels ( for the coupled - channels approach see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in both cases of the order of 15 parameters were needed to obtain a more - or - less satisfactory fit to the pre - lear data , the bulk of which consisted of elastic differential cross sections . at that time",
    "charge - exchange data and spin - dependent observables were practically absent . because the @xmath17 system is so much more complicated than the already quite complex @xmath8 system it was then believed that it would be impossible to perform a pwa of the @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "the complexity of the @xmath0 system when compared to the @xmath8 system ( below the pion - production threshold ) is reflected in the following manner in a pwa . in proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) scattering ( isospin @xmath18 ) one has to specify at each energy 2 phase shifts ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) for @xmath21 and on the average 2.5 phase parameters for each value of the total angular momentum @xmath22 . as an example : for @xmath23 one needs only one phase shift ( @xmath24 ) , while for @xmath25 one needs 4 phase parameters ( the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 phase shifts and the @xmath29 mixing parameter ) . in a pwa of the neutron - proton ( @xmath2 ) scattering",
    "data ( both isospin @xmath30 and @xmath18 ) again 2 phase shifts are required for @xmath21 , but now 5 phase parameters are required for each value of @xmath22 . due to the lack of sufficient high - quality @xmath2 data",
    "it has been impossible to do a good pwa of the @xmath2 data alone .",
    "one needs to take the @xmath18 phases ( with the exception of the @xmath19 phase shift ) from the pwa of the @xmath1 data and correct them for electromagnetic and mass - difference effects ( @xmath31 versus @xmath32 and @xmath33 versus @xmath34 ) . in the case of @xmath0 scattering",
    "the pauli principle is not operative .",
    "apart from this , the possibility for the @xmath0 system to annihilate into mesons complicates things even further .",
    "this means that one has to determine no less than four times as many phase parameters compared to the case of @xmath2 scattering , so 8 phase parameters are required for @xmath21 and 20 phase parameters for each value of @xmath35 . in view of this",
    ", the situation with regards to a @xmath0 pwa indeed seemed quite hopeless .",
    "using essentially the same strategy as in the nijmegen multienergy partial - wave analyses of @xmath8 scattering data , and with the available recent high - quality data from lear and kek , we have nevertheless been able to perform a pwa of @xmath0 scattering data below 925 mev / c .",
    "this work was started in 1987  @xcite and a preliminary report of this analysis has already been given  @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the coupled antiproton - proton and antineutron - neutron ( @xmath3 ) channels is solved .",
    "the short - range interaction , including the coupling to the mesonic annihilation channels , is parametrized by way of a complex boundary condition specified at @xmath36 fm .",
    "the long - range interaction consists of the coulomb potential , the magnetic - moment interaction , and the one - pion  exchange potential .",
    "the tail of the heavy - boson  exchange part of the nijmegen potential  @xcite is used as intermediate - range interaction .",
    "a lot of time and effort has gone into collecting , scrutinizing , and cleaning up the world set of @xmath0 scattering data , which contains quite some flaws and contradictory data .",
    "exactly the same arguments were used in this process as were used in the set - up of the nijmegen @xmath8 database  @xcite .",
    "the resulting nijmegen 1993 @xmath0 database in the momentum interval 119923 mev / c consists of @xmath37 @xmath0 data , which can be fitted with @xmath38 . in view of the excellent quality of this fit",
    "one can be confident that most of the amplitudes are quite well described .",
    "the same methods have also been applied by us to the strangeness - exchange reaction @xmath39 , which is an even more complicated process  @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the interaction in the region @xmath48 is described by a theoretically well - founded antinucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "this potential is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the relativistic coulomb and magnetic - moment interaction respectively .",
    "@xmath52 is the @xmath17 meson - exchange potential .",

    "then the coulomb wave functions become @xmath81 in terms of ordinary spherical bessel , neumann , and hankel functions . the matching procedure at @xmath65 works as follows .",
    "the multichannel wronskian is defined by @xmath82 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath83 and the `` t '' denotes transposition in channel space .",
    "the wronskian of two arbitrary solutions @xmath84 and @xmath85 is independent of @xmath83 and equal to 0 because of the boundary condition @xmath86 . demanding that @xmath87 we obtain for the partial - wave @xmath40 matrix @xmath88^{-1 }     \\left [ \\phi^{\\prime{\\rm t } }     \\frac{\\textstyle 1}{\\textstyle \\sqrt{mp } } h_{2 } - \\phi^{\\rm t }     \\sqrt{\\frac{\\textstyle p}{\\textstyle m } } h'_{2 } \\right ] \\:\\ : ,     \\label{eq : smtrx}\\ ] ] where the prime on the hankel functions denotes differentiation with respect to the argument @xmath89 .",
    "since the matching is to coulomb wave functions , what is actually obtained in this manner is the partial - wave @xmath40 matrix with respect to the coulomb force , denoted by @xmath90 . how to calculate the scattering amplitude is explained in section v. the final step , the calculation of all the observables from the scattering amplitude , is standard  @xcite .",
    "see in particular ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of antinucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "the short - range dynamics is treated with the help of a boundary condition applied at a distance @xmath14 .",
    "this boundary condition , called the @xmath91  matrix , is the logarithmic derivative of the solution matrix @xmath92 at a distance @xmath14 from the origin @xmath93 the factor @xmath94 is included in this definition in order to make the @xmath91 matrix dimensionless .",
    "the boundary - condition approach to strong interactions goes back to the work of feshbach and lomon  @xcite and earlier .",
    "the term @xmath91 matrix was introduced by jaffe and low  @xcite for use with the bag model where at the energies of the eigenstates of the confined quark and gluon degrees of freedom the @xmath91 matrix exhibits poles that are not necessarily also present in the @xmath40 matrix .",
    "( for a review , see ref .  @xcite . ) at this stage , we will not attempt to make any connection with multiquark states . in general , this boundary relates the inner- to the outer - region physics . in @xmath8 and @xmath17",
    "scattering the short - range interaction is essentially unknown and has to be treated phenomenologically .",
    "the long - range physics one understands theoretically much better .",
    "the @xmath91-matrix formalism provides a useful separation between these two regions and has become a powerful tool in analyzing scattering data . in the nijmegen partial - wave analyses of @xmath8 scattering data",
    "@xcite the @xmath91-matrix method has already proven its power  @xcite .    for the parametrization of the partial - wave @xmath91 matrix , it is convenient to use a very simple model for the short - range dynamics .",
    "we assume that the interaction in each partial wave can be described by a spherical well , a potential which may depend on spin , isospin , and energy , but which is constant as a function of distance .",
    "the @xmath91 matrix for such a potential can be evaluated analytically . for a single - channel spherical - well",
    "problem in a partial wave with orbital angular momentum @xmath95 it is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 with @xmath98 the spherical bessel function and @xmath99 , @xmath100 being the depth of the spherical - well potential .",
    "the prime on the bessel function denotes differentiation with respect to the argument . in the case of @xmath17 scattering",
    "we take these short - range potentials to be complex in order to account for the annihilation into mesonic channels .",
    "the short - range interaction is in this manner described by a simple state - dependent optical potential  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that we can take the short - range spherical - well potential independent of the energy and still fit the data properly .",
    "this was not possible in the nijmegen partial - wave analyses of the @xmath8 data : there we had to make the short - range potential energy dependent . that this is not necessary for @xmath17 scattering is probably because of the absence of high - quality data at low energies such as present in @xmath8 scattering",
    "it is , however , crucial that we take the real parts to be dependent on spin and isospin .",
    "it also turned out that the imaginary parts of these short - range potentials could be taken independent of isospin .",
    "each partial wave is thus parametrized by a maximum of 3 parameters , a complex spherical well for both isospin 0 and 1 , where the imaginary parts are equal for both isospins .",
    "how many and which parameters are actually needed in each individual partial wave is discussed below in section ix .    in the nijmegen analyses of @xmath8 scattering data , a value of @xmath101 fm for the boundary radius was found to be suitable . in the @xmath17 case ,",
    "the results are rather sensitive on the choice of the value of @xmath94 .",
    "the best results are obtained with @xmath102 fm .",
    "since we use in the outer region a real potential consisting of an electromagnetic and a meson - exchange part , the coupling to the mesonic channels is completely absorbed in the boundary condition .",
    "the radius @xmath94 is therefore a clear measure for the range of the annihilation potential .",
    "the fact that the results are quite sensitive on @xmath94 shows that this range is in fact approximately 1.3 fm .",
    "so we find definite indication that annihilation in @xmath0 scattering is a rather long - range process .",
    "it remains to discuss the parametrization of the @xmath91  matrix for the states with @xmath63 coupled by the tensor force . in these cases",
    "it is convenient to use the method also employed in the @xmath8 case . for a certain value of the isospin ,",
    "we start with a diagonal @xmath62 @xmath91  matrix and use additional parameters to describe the short - range mixing between the two coupled partial waves , as follows @xmath103 the mixing angle @xmath104 can , if necessary , be parametrized as a function of energy , but again in our analysis we can take it in all cases independent of the energy .",
    "we need these mixing angles only for the isospin @xmath30 states , for the @xmath18 states they can be set to zero .",
    "time - reversal invariance allows us to choose the phases of the physical states in such a way that the potential matrix is symmetric .",
    "the full @xmath40 matrix , including all mesonic channels , is then also symmetric and of course unitary .",
    "when we restrict ourselves to the @xmath17 channels , then this sub - block of the @xmath40 matrix is of course still symmetric , but no longer unitary .",
    "this reflects the disappearance of probability ( flux ) into the mesonic channels .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath91 matrix in our case is still symmetric , but not hermitian , as in @xmath8 scattering ( below the pion - production threshold ) .    why is the @xmath91-matrix approach to partial - wave analyses so convenient and powerful ? one of the main reasons is that it allows an easy parametrization of the energy dependence of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the long - range interactions lead to rapid variations with energy of the amplitudes .",
    "these variations are much easier to parametrize when one uses the @xmath91 matrix than the @xmath40 matrix ( or @xmath105 matrix ) .",
    "for instance , in the presence of the coulomb interaction , the @xmath40 matrix has an essential singularity and a branchpoint at zero energy .",
    "however , if the coulomb potential is included in the potential tail , these singularities and the corresponding left - hand cut are absent from the @xmath91 matrix .",
    "similarly , the left - hand cuts due to all meson exchanges included in the potential tail are absent from the @xmath91 matrix .",
    "all these cuts , however , are present in the @xmath40 matrix , in addition to the kinematical unitarity cut .",
    "the point is that the slow variations with energy of the amplitudes due to short - range interactions are easy to parametrize , once the rapid variations have been taken care of by explicitly including the corresponding long - range potentials in the schrdinger equation .",
    "of course , some left - hand cuts remain , such as the cut due to uncorrelated two - pion exchange , as well as right - hand cuts due to the coupling to inelastic channels .",
    "these , however , lead to much slower energy variations of the amplitudes than the long - range electromagnetic interactions and one - pion exchange .",
    "in order to obtain a good description of the data , the long - range interaction between the particles , consisting of the electromagnetic interaction and the one - pion  exchange potential , must be included properly .",
    "these interactions are model independent in the sense that they are ( or at least should be ) the same in all models of the ( anti)nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "the fit to the data is improved when realistic meson - exchange forces are used as intermediate - range potential .",
    "the long - range electromagnetic potential is included to order @xmath106 , the fine - structure constant .",
    "the one - photon  exchange potential is derived from the phenomenological electromagnetic lagrangian @xmath107\\ :    a^{\\mu } \\ : + \\ : e\\:\\frac{\\kappa}{4m}\\:[\\overline{\\psi }    \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi]\\ : ( \\partial^{\\mu}a^{\\nu}-    \\partial^{\\nu}a^{\\mu } ) \\:\\ : , \\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the nucleon charge in units of @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the anomalous magnetic moment , for proton and neutron @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , respectively .",

    ". the static limits @xmath118 are @xmath119 in the point - particle approximation the momentum dependence of these form factors , reflecting the inner structure of the nucleons , is neglected . in this approximation we end up with the spin - dependent one - photon  exchange potentials for @xmath48 @xmath120 and @xmath121 these potentials are obtained by calculating the one - photon ",
    "exchange diagrams in momentum space and applying a fourier transformation to configuration space .",
    "the momentum dependence of the form factors can be taken into account .",
    "this leads to short - range modifications of the one - photon  exchange potential .",
    "since we use only the potential outside @xmath36 fm , we did not include these effects .",

    "since we are talking about a total of 540 cross sections ( not counting the eisenhandler data ) we decided to put some effort in trying to determine what is wrong with these data , instead of rejecting them outright .",
    "this turned out to be very difficult .",
    "the discussion about statistical and systematic errors in most of the original papers can be called marginal at best .",
    "sometimes results from legendre fits are presented , but in several cases it turns out that the @xmath268 of these fits is much too high for a statistical data set .",
    "the procedure that we followed to examine these data was as follows .",
    "we fitted each differential cross section with @xmath298 @xmath299 was determined by the requirement that the error on the corresponding coefficient @xmath300 was smaller than the coefficient itself . in the ideal situation this would give a fit with @xmath301 .",
    "however , for few groups this was actually the case .",
    "we then enlarged the errors by adding a point - to - point systematic error in quadrature to the quoted statistical errors .",
    "the amount of error added was determined by the requirement that now indeed @xmath302 .",
    "once for a group this result was approached , outliers were removed ( three - standard - deviation rule ) .",
    "for some groups special measures had to be taken , which we will discuss now .",
    "the results of these investigations are summarized in table  [ tab : flaws ] .",
    "the data measured by ps173  @xcite are at the most forward angles contaminated by effects due to multiple scattering in the target ( molire scattering ) .",
    "since the experimentalists do not present their data corrected for these effects , and since these corrections depend on details of the target used , there is no way for us to take these effects into account .",
    "consequently , the only sensible thing to do is to reject the data at angles where multiple - scattering effects are believed to be seen .",
    "these data were used to extract the real - to - imaginary ratio of the forward scattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps remarkable that in ref .",
    "@xcite values for this ratio were presented at more momenta than the four for which the corresponding differential cross sections were presented in refs .",
    "these remaining cross sections have never been published . after removing the points at forword angles ,",
    "difficulties remain . at 287",
    "mev / c it is necessary to reject five individual data points and add a 5% point - to - point error . at 505",
    "mev / c two outliers must be removed and at 590 mev / c a 3% error must be added .    the data taken at kek  @xcite present serious difficulties of a different kind . the only manner to achieve satisfactory results in a legendre fit seemed to be to either",
    "reject a large number of data points or to enlarge all errors by a significant amount ( @xmath303 @xmath304% ) .",
    "however , improvement could be obtained in the following manner .",
    "it turned out that most difficulties resided in the data taken in the `` one - prong '' region  @xcite , i.e. at forward and backward angles .",
    "the data at intermediate angles , the `` two - prong '' region , appear to be less troublesome .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite different systematic errors are quoted for these two regions , although the experimentalists perform legendre fits to the data as one group .",
    "when we split the groups at 490 , 591 , 689 , and 781 mev / c into two different parts , it suffices to enlarge the statistical errors by a smaller amount , and in some `` two - prong '' regions the data need no corrections at all .    the description of the data taken by ps172  @xcite improves much when the points at the most forward and at the most backward angle at removed at all momenta ( f. bradamante , private communication ) . at 886",
    "mev / c three additional outliers have to be rejected . especially for these groups there remains a big problem with the normalization  @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "for the data at 697 mev",
    "/ c  @xcite from the ps198 group the statistical errors may have been underestimated .",
    "we had to enlarge these by adding a 6% point - to - point error .",
    "after all these corrections have been applied to the different groups the next step is to see to what extent the legendre coefficients at comparable momenta are consistent .",
    "these coefficients are presented in table  [ tab : legendre ] .",
    "it is immediately clear that significant problems occur in the normalization @xmath152 of the different groups ( which is why we present the `` renormalized '' legendre coefficients @xmath305 for @xmath306 ) .",
    "this is especially true for the ps172 data .",
    "the probable reason  @xcite for the difficulties is that data could only be taken in a very limited angular region , so that only a small fraction @xmath303 5% of the cross section is detected .",
    "properly normalizing the data is then especially difficult .",
    "these data would have to be treated with a `` floated '' normalization .",
    "certainly a 10% normalization uncertainty as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite is not sufficient .",
    "since also the kek data in the `` two - prong '' region cover a limited angular region it would be a good idea to float these normalizations as well , since they are not consistent with the normalizations of the data in the `` one - prong '' regions .",
    "apart from these normalization problems it is clear from a study of table  [ tab : legendre ] that it is very unlikely that the different experiments are consistent .",
    "certainly , the ps173 data at 590 mev / c are not compatible with the kek data at 591 mev / c ; the ps172 data at 783 mev / c are not compatible with the kek data at 781 mev / c , nor with the eisenhandler data at 790 mev / c .",
    "the ps198 data at 439 mev / c do not appear to intrapolate between the kek data at 392 and 490 mev / c , etcetera .",
    "so , although many beautiful data have come out of lear and kek , unfortunately elastic differential cross sections are not among them .    to summarize , at present we are prejudiced in favor of the pre - lear data by eisenhandler _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , although we can not exclude completely the possibility that these data contain unspecified systematic errors and that one of the lear or ( more unlikely ) the kek experiments is correct after all .",
    "preliminary study showed that we could obtain a reasonable fit to the lear data from ps172 and ps198 , but only at the cost of rejecting the pre - lear data of eisenhandler _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and of sakamoto _ et al_.  @xcite . and",
    "still , the problems with the data from ps173 and kek would remain .",
    "further investigation is required before such a drastic step will be taken .",
    "obviously , a dedicated new experiment that might shed some light on this issue would be highly welcome .",
    "after deciding on the final content of the nijmegen 1993 @xmath0 database to be used in the pwa , the free @xmath91-matrix parameters are fitted to these data . in table  [ tab : data ] we present an overview of the results of this fit for all the @xmath0 scattering data . in this table",
    "one can find the values for @xmath268 for each individual group , the normalization predicted by the pwa , and the data points and groups that have been rejected by us on statistical grounds .",
    "the total number of scattering observables that are rejected is 204 , not including the problematic lear and kek elastic differential cross sections discussed in the previous section .",
    "three normalization data are rejected .",
    "we reject three groups because of an improbable high @xmath268 , and two groups because of an improbable low @xmath268 . in the final fit we have ( in the notation of sect .",
    "vii ) @xmath307 so that @xmath308 when the data set is a perfect statistical ensemble and when the model is totally correct one expects @xmath309 our best fit to the final 1993 database results in @xmath310 corresponding to @xmath311 the 3543 scattering observables contribute 3700.9 to @xmath268 , which means that the 103 normalization data contribute the remaining 100.1 of @xmath268 .    in order to get a feeling for some of these numbers , let us compare them to the @xmath8 case . in the nijmegen",
    "@xmath8 pwa the database contains @xmath312 @xmath8 scattering data , which are described with @xmath313 or @xmath314  @xcite .",
    "the number of model parameters needed in our case is 30 , which is a reasonable number , in view of the fact that 21 parameters were used in the nijmegen @xmath1 pwa and an additional 18 in the @xmath2 pwa .",
    "the values for the @xmath91-matrix parameters and their errors are tabulated in table  [ tab : pars ] .",
    "the parameters for the higher partial waves are the same as the corresponding state given in this table .",
    "for instance , the @xmath315 wave has the same parameters as the @xmath26 wave , the @xmath316 wave the same as the @xmath317 wave , the @xmath318 the same as the @xmath28 , and so on . this is just a convenient prescription . for higher partial waves the short - range parametrization is irrelevant due to the centrifugal barrier and the dynamics",
    "is completely determined by the potential tail .",
    "as explained in section iii , these parameters correspond to a spin - dependent optical potential for the short - range interaction .",
    "it can be seen that even if one introduces for each partial wave of specific isospin a simple complex spherical - well potential , then still by no means all of these parameters can be determined from the existing data .",
    "this is in striking contrast with for instance the @xmath1 analysis where one needs 4 parameters already to describe the @xmath19 channel .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath1 @xmath19 phase shift is very accurately known at very low energies ( below 3 mev ) .",
    "a proper description of the @xmath91 waves in the @xmath1 case also requires more than one parameter for each wave . in our @xmath0 case , no single partial wave ( of specific isospin ) needs more than one parameter for the real part of the short - range interaction , but on the other hand much more partial waves contribute significantly to the scattering process .",
    "this is especially true for the charge - exchange reaction , as can be seen from table  [ tab : partxs ] where we give the partial - wave cross sections for the elastic and charge - exchange reaction at a number of momenta , as well as the total and annihilation cross section .",
    "compared to nucleon - nucleon scattering , one notes a large contribution of @xmath91 and @xmath319 waves to the cross sections already at low momenta .",
    "the reason for this is the greater strength of the antinucleon - nucleon potentials , especially the central and tensor potentials .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stot ] we show the results for the total and annihilation cross sections as a function of momentum .",
    "the high - quality data are from the lear experiments ps172  @xcite ( total cross sections ) and ps173  @xcite ( annihilation cross sections ) .",
    "we calculate total cross sections with the optical theorem .",
    "obviously , these cross sections can only be compared to the experimental data , when the effects of the coulomb interaction can be neglected .",
    "except for the lowest momenta ( @xmath320 200 mev / c ) this is probably a good approximation .",
    "an example of the fit to the differential cross sections from eisenhandler _",
    "et al_.  @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : xsel ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : xsbw ] the fit to the backward elastic cross sections ( @xmath321 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite is demonstrated . assuming that these data are correct , it can be seen from this figure that there appears to be room for improvement at the lowest momenta .",
    "this is precisely the momentum region ( @xmath322 509 mev / c ) where some statistical evidence for a resonance was found  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section for charge - exchange scattering is given in figure  [ fig : xsce ] , compared to recent high - quality data taken by ps199  @xcite at 693 mev / c .",
    "this is one of the most constaining experiments in the database . in order to fit this group properly ,",
    "orbital angular momenta up to @xmath323 must be taken into account .",
    "the cross section exhibits the typical dip - bump structure at forward angles , which can be understood as an interference effect between one - pion exchange and a background  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no data of similar quality have been taken in this dip - bump region .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ayel ] we give the results for the analyzing power ( polarization ) for elastic scattering , compared with the recent data from ps172  @xcite and from ps198  @xcite .",
    "the fits to the analyzing - power data for the charge - exchange reaction from ps199  @xcite are shown in figure  [ fig : ayce ] .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : dyy ] the prediction for the depolarization for elastic scattering at 783 mev / c is shown compared to the data from ps172  @xcite .",
    "only a few depolarization data exist : one point at 679 mev / c , three points at 783 mev / c , and one point at 886 mev / c .",
    "these data points are not included in the fit in view of the large error bars .",
    "this also means that no normalization error is taken into account .    in sect .",
    "vi a formalism was proposed to extract phase - shift parameters and inelasticities from the @xmath40 matrix for antinucleon - nucleon scattering . it does not make much sense to present all these phase shifts , inelasticities and mixing parameters without a proper assessment of the uncertainties ( statistical errors ) .",
    "this , however , requires a lot of work .",
    "preliminary study shows that the phase - shift parameters for the @xmath19 and @xmath324 partial waves are not pinned down accurately at all above @xmath322 400 mev / c . on the other hand ,",
    "a large number of parameters appear to be very well determined by the existing data , such as the @xmath183 and @xmath325 phase shifts and inelasticities , and the @xmath326 mixing parameters .",
    "all results are available in numerical form from the authors .",
    "an extensive discussion of the remaining uncertainties in the predictions of the pwa and the phase - shift parameters will be presented elsewhere .    in our 1991 preliminary pwa",
    "@xcite we were able to determine the charged - pion ",
    "nucleon coupling constant @xmath6 from the data on the charge - exchange reaction @xmath42 , in which only isovector mesons can be exchanged . in this pwa we analyzed 884 scattering observables between 400 and 950 mev / c , using 23 free parameters .",
    "we found @xmath6 = 0.0751(17 ) , at the pion pole .",
    "the error is purely statistical .",
    "this value was in nice agreement with other determinations of @xmath6 from @xmath2  @xcite and @xmath327 scattering data  @xcite .",
    "these results provided strong evidence for an approximate charge - independent pion - nucleon coupling constant , since they were consistent with the value for @xmath328 found in the nijmegen @xmath1 pwa  @xcite .    since this preliminary analysis ,",
    "more high - quality analyzing - power data for the charge - exchange reaction have become available from ps199  @xcite .",
    "we have repeated the determination of @xmath6 , but this time from the complete 1993 nijmegen database .",
    "the coupling constants of the neutral pion were kept at the value of @xmath328 = @xmath329 = 0.0745 .",
    "since @xmath328 is determined by the data on elastic scattering @xmath123 , and @xmath6 by the data on charge - exchange scattering @xmath42 , one expects that the correlation between the two is small . adding @xmath6 as the 31st free parameter , we now find @xmath330 at the pion pole .",
    "this result supersedes our previous value from ref .",
    "again , the error is of statistical origin only . in view of the enormous amount of work involved",
    ", it is very hard for us to make statements about possible systematic errors on this result . in ref .",
    "@xcite we did demonstrate that there were no systematic errors due to form - factor effects or due to @xmath174(770 ) exchange .",
    "in the nijmegen @xmath1 pwa systematic errors could be more thoroughly investigated and there they were found to be small  @xcite . although in our case the systematic errors are probably larger than for the @xmath1 case , it is very encouraging that the available charge - exchange data pin down the charged - pion coupling constant with a remarkably small statistical error and that the result is consistent with other determinations from @xmath327  @xcite and @xmath8 scattering  @xcite .",
    "very probably the new lear experiment ps206  @xcite will further constrain the charged - pion ",
    "nucleon coupling constant .",
    "to summarize , we have performed an energy - dependent partial - wave analysis of all antiproton - proton scattering data below 925 mev / c antiproton momentum , published in a regular physics journal since 1968 .",
    "this is the first time such an analysis has been attempted .",
    "we have set up the nijmegen 1993 @xmath0 database by scrutinizing and passing sentence on all available @xmath0 scattering observables below 925 mev / c .",
    "serious problems were encountered with a set of 540 elastic differential cross sections from lear and kek .",
    "these data were rejected , although further study is required here . of the remaining 3747 scattering observables 204 ( 5.4% )",
    "were rejected on the grounds of sound statistical criteria .",
    "we also rejected three normalization data .",
    "the final database contains 3543 scattering observables and 103 normalization data for a total of 3646 scattering data . using 30 free parameters we obtain @xmath268 = 3801.0 corresponding to @xmath5 = 1.043 .",
    "this shows that the tail of the charge - conjugated nijmegen potential is a realistic intermediate- and long - range @xmath0 force .",
    "data on the charge - exchange reaction @xmath16 provide further evidence for a `` low '' and approximately charge - independent pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath331 @xmath303 0.0745 .",
    "the present results will serve as a starting - point for future investigations by our group of the antiproton - proton system , and should be of help in planning further experiments at lear and elsewhere .",
    "we would like to thank the members of the ps172 , ps173 , ps198 , and ps199 lear collaborations at cern for providing us with their data and for their interest in our work .",
