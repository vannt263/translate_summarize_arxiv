    "we have employed the opacity code star @xcite to calculate the opacity of a 24-element solar mixture along a thermodynamic path obtained from a solar model implemented by villante et al .",

    "bound - bound and bound - free atomic calculations are performed in the sta framework @xcite and based on a fully relativistic quantum mechanical theory via the dirac equation , while inverse bremsstrahlung is calculated via a screened hydrogenic approximation with a degeneracy correction @xcite .",
    "calculations were performed in the is and ic approximation . in the is model each ion is enclosed within a spherical volume whose radius @xmath9 is the wigner - seitz radius of the plasma .",
    "in addition , the ionic distribution vanishes inside the sphere while it is smeared out completely outside of it , so that the ion - ion pair correlation function @xmath10 takes the form of a step function and due to overall charge neutrality the central potential vanishes outside the sphere .",
    "such a model neglects the possibility for ionic charge to penetrate into the ion sphere and screen the central potential seen by atomic wavefunctions , as illustrated in .",
    "on the other hand , the ic model @xcite includes a more realistic treatment of ionic structure which is solved self - consistently with the electronic structure and which screens the central potential . for strongly coupled plasmas ( lower temperatures and higher densities )",
    "the ionic structure features the well known short range order , whereas for more weakly coupled plasmas , such as the solar mixture , it is smeared out while ions penetrate within the ion - sphere , as described in .",
    "the longer range of the central potential in the ic model slightly widens the spatial range of bound orbitals .",
    "this causes an increase of the spatial overlap between bound and continuum states which in turn increase the photoionization cross section @xcite , enabling a non - negligible increase of the rosseland opacity .",
    "in addition , the longer range of the potential slightly lowers the average ionization .",
    "we note that solar opacity calculations in the ic framework were performed in the past @xcite , using the older soler abundances @xcite .",
    "the resulting variation , between is and ic , in the rosseland opacity of the solar mixture throughout the solar interior , is shown in ( red line ) , together with the range of opacity variation required for solar models to agree with helioseismic and neutrino observations . a @xmath0 increase near the czb , which is about half of the missing opacity ,",
    "is obtained .",
    "in addition , we note that in order to reconcile only the observed and predicted sound speed profile and convection boundary radius , the opacity variation profile must only have a _ shape _ lying within the variation band , while its magnitude is only required to reconcile the observed neutrino fluxes and surface helium abundance @xcite .",
    "therefore , by a constant @xmath11 upward shift of the resulting variation profile ( blue line ) , it is evident that its shape is very similar to , and almost lies within the limits posed by the observational constraints for the sound speed profile and convection radius .    in ,",
    "the monochromatic opacities of iron calculated by star , at the conditions reached in the recent sandia experiment @xcite are shown .",
    "similar results were obtained by using the crsta atomic code @xcite .",
    "the resulting rosseland opacity in the ic model is larger by @xmath12 than in the is model , due to a significant increase of the m - shell photoionization cross - section , which results from the larger overlap of the m - shell bound orbital with the continuum states in the ic calculation .",
    "we note that despite having a significant contribution to the rosseland opacity , which peaks at a photon energy of @xmath13 , the m - shell spectral range is currently not accessible in the @xmath14 spectral range reached in opacity experiments at the sandia z machine , which includes only the l - shell spectral range .",
    "we note that such required soft x - ray spectrometers are currently being developed @xcite .",
    "it is seen from that the plasma correlation has a smaller effect on the more strongly bound l - shell orbitals , and therefore can not explain the `` higher than predicted '' iron opacity @xcite , which is found in the l - shell spectral range . hence , the correlation effect for iron can not be measured currently in such a monochromatic experiment .",
    "we now illustrate how rosseland opacities at solar interior conditions can be measured directly via radiation flow experiments @xcite in high energy density facilities .",
    "in such experiments the rosseland mean is inferred directly from the measured breakout time of an x - ray supersonic radiative wave crossing a foam , which is coupled to a high temperature thermal x - ray source , as illustrated in a. employing the nif , a drive temperature of up to @xmath15ev can be reached @xcite , which covers the temperatures in the sun ranging from the czb ( @xmath6 ) and deeper , up to @xmath7 . by using low - z foams , electron densities prevailing in the latter region of the sun can also be achieved .",
    "therefore , by doping the foam with permilles of dominant photon absorbers in the sun , such as oxygen , magnesium and iron , the rosseland opacity can be studied experimentally at solar interior conditions that were never achieved in the past .",
    "as an example , in we list the properties of the ch , ch@xmath16 and ch@xmath17 plastic foams , doped with oxygen , neon , magnesium and iron with a number concentration of @xmath18 each , at conditions found in the sun at four different locations : @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the foam densities corresponding to conditions at the solar interior are in the range of @xmath21 .",
    "plastic foams can be easily manufactured with various hydrogen to carbon ratios and with densities of up to @xmath22 , which corresponds to @xmath23 , where the temperature is @xmath24ev .",
    "the resulting ion - correlation effect is a non negligible @xmath25 in the rosseland opacity , and therefore , can be validated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the small amount of doping does not affect thermodynamic properties of the plasma such as the chemical potential , average ionization and electron density , while it significantly affects radiative properties .",
    "in b we list the contributions of the different elements in the doped ch foam to its rosseland opacity .",
    "it is evident that the majority of the opacity ( @xmath26 ) is due to the doped elements , with iron having the largest contribution ( @xmath27 ) , while the remaining @xmath28 is due to the carbon k - shell photoionization , which can can be significantly reduced by using lower z foams . since the opacity is highly dependent on the composition and amount of doping and also on the type of foam , by performing a series of experiments with varying amount of doping , composition and foams , the experimental errors can be reduced significantly . in addition ,",
    "rosseland opacity fractions of test elements can be easily measured by comparing the results of foams with and without the tested element .",
    "finally we note that calibration and comparison of measurements with different foam setups is easily achieved by aligning the foams together , so that they would experience the same radiation drive .",

    "an experimental validation of opacity calculations at stellar interior conditions , which has never been performed in the past , should aid significantly in understanding the source of the missing opacity .    in this work ,",
    "the effect of ion - ion correlations which results from the extremely complex interaction between ions in a plasma , was pointed out as a source of uncertainty in the calculation of solar opacities .",
    "the effect was studied by using the ion - correlation model @xcite which includes a more realistic treatment of ionic structure , that was not heretofore considered .",
    "we found a significant @xmath0 increase in the rosseland opacity near the czb and an opacity variation profile which assimilates the missing opacity required by helioseismology and neutrino observations .",
    "hence , we conclude that correlation effects consist of an important ingredient of the missing opacity .",
    "this calls for a detailed examination of the effect with more advanced plasma models @xcite , since the ic calculations presented in this work were performed in the debye - huckel approximation . in a recent work",
    "@xcite we have shown that uncertainties in line - broadening models , another plasma effect , also have a significant contribution to the missing opacity , and in fact , can account for all of the missing opacity , if the line - width uncertainty is of a factor of about @xmath39 .",
    "the uncertainties in line broadening models which are used in opacity codes are unknown , as they were never tested experimentally at stellar interior conditions",
    ". however , a factor of @xmath39 seems to be too large , since differences between line - width models are typically factors of @xmath40 .",
    "the ion - ion correlations effect which was studied in this work , may compensate for the remaining missing opacity with such moderate factors . a detailed analysis which includes a sound theoretical or experimental quantification of the uncertainties due the various plasma effects , which depends solely on the temperature and free electron density ,",
    "is called for .",
    "we also examined the correlation effect for iron conditions reached at the recent sandia experiment @xcite and found a @xmath1 increase in the rosseland opacity , which is mainly due to an increase of the m - shell photoionization cross section , which can not be accessed experimentally with current spectrometers .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the possibility to measure rosseland opacities via radiation flow experiments in high energy density facilities , by using plastic foams doped with permilles of dominant photon absorbers in the sun , and shown that it is possible to cover the temperatures and densities of the solar plasma at solar radii ranging from the czb ( @xmath6 ) and deeper , up to @xmath41 which were never achieved in laboratory experiments .",
    "we have also shown that ion - correlation effects can be observed directly in such experiments .",
    "the method is complementary and advantageous to monochromatic z experiments , which give detailed information on opacity spectra , but have several drawbacks : ( i ) the inability to access the more important spectral range closer to the rosseland peak , ( ii ) only electron densities smaller by a factor of @xmath42 than those found near the czb can be reached due to hydrodynamic expansion of the sample @xcite ( iii ) the measured electron densities are uncertain by @xmath8 @xcite since they are inferred from crude line broadening models for mg k - shell lines and ( iv ) higher temperatures found in deeper regions in the sun can not be reached .",
    "these disadvantages are overcome in radiation flow experiments for which : ( i ) only rosseland opacities are measured , ( ii ) plastic foams can be manufactured at densities corresponding to the solar plasma in the range @xmath43 and there is no hydrodynamic expansion of the foam since the radiative heat wave is supersonic , ( iii ) the foam density , which is known to a high precision , determines the electron density and ( iv ) temperatures of up to @xmath38ev can be reached @xcite . hence , radiation flow experiments are an ideal method for an experimental study of rosseland opacities of the solar plasma .",
