    "an interesting feature of @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories is the existence of the relation between the @xmath1-function and the anomalous dimension of the matter superfields , which is called `` the exact nsvz @xmath1-function '' @xcite .",

    "( [ hisano_shifman_relation ] ) is valid has not also been found .",
    "however , the nsvz scheme has been constructed for ( rigid ) @xmath0 sqed with @xmath6 flavors @xcite . in order to specify this subtraction scheme",
    "one should regularize the theory by higher derivatives @xcite .",
    "( unlike the dimensional reduction @xcite , this method is mathematically consistent and can be formulated in a manifestly @xmath0 supersymmetric way @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 generalizations are also possible @xcite . )",
    "the main observation which allows constructing the nsvz scheme is that , in the case of using the higher derivative regularization , the rg functions of @xmath0 sqed with @xmath6 flavors defined in terms of the bare coupling constant ( see eq .",
    "( [ bare_definitions ] ) below ) satisfy the nsvz relation    @xmath14    in all orders independently of the subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "the scheme independence follows from the fact @xcite that these rg functions ( defined in terms of the bare coupling constant ) depend on a regularization , but do not depend on a subtraction scheme if a regularization is fixed .",
    "( [ nsvz_beta_bare ] ) follows from the factorization of integrals defining @xmath15 into integrals of ( double ) total derivatives @xcite .",
    "this feature of quantum corrections has been rigorously proved in all orders in @xcite and was confirmed by explicit three - loop calculations @xcite .",
    "factorization into double total derivatives was also demonstrated for various non - abelian supersymmetric theories and for various versions of the higher derivative regularization @xcite in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "the scheme - dependence becomes essential for the rg functions defined ( standardly ) in terms of the renormalized coupling constant @xcite .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ nsvz_beta_bare ] ) , it is possible to construct a simple prescription giving the subtraction scheme in which the rg functions defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant satisfy the nsvz relation in all orders @xcite , if the ( abelian ) supersymmetric theory is regularized by higher derivatives . up to now , no analogs of this result have been found in the case of using the dimensional reduction , although structures similar to integrals of total derivatives were investigated @xcite . at present , the only way to construct the nsvz scheme with the dimensional reduction is making a specially tuned finite renormalization which relates it with the @xmath16-scheme in every order of the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the same situation takes place in theories with softly broken supersymmetry , because renormalization of the softly broken theories is related to renormalization of the rigid theories @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to investigate what is the origin of eq .",
    "( [ soft_mass_renormalized ] ) , how it can be directly derived by summing feynman diagrams , and in what subtraction scheme it is valid . in this paper",
    "we give the answers to the first two questions for softly broken @xmath0 sqed with @xmath6 flavors , regularized by higher derivatives .    for this purpose",
    "we will use the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was also applied for obtaining the exact expression for the adler @xmath17-function @xcite for @xmath0 sqcd in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will demonstrate that this method can also be used in softly broken abelian supersymmetric theories for deriving the exact expression for the photino mass anomalous dimension defined in terms of the bare coupling constant .",
    "in particular , we will prove that the renormalization of the photino mass is determined by integrals of double total derivatives in all orders .",
    "exactly as in the case of the rigid theory , such integrals do not vanish due to singularities of the integrands . by summing these singularities for softly broken @xmath0 sqed with @xmath6 flavors regularized by higher derivatives it is possible to derive the exact equation    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the bare photino mass and @xmath20 denotes the dimensionful parameter of the regularized theory , which plays the role of the ultraviolet cut - off .",

    "this means that investigating the renormalization of various green functions we consider the limit in which @xmath4 is much smaller than the external momenta .    for calculating quantum corrections in the considered theory we will use the higher derivative regularization .",

    "<S> we consider the softly broken @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics , regularized by higher derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> for this theory we demonstrate that the renormalization of the photino mass is determined by integrals of double total derivatives in the momentum space in all orders . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it is possible to derive the nsvz - like exact relation between the photino mass anomalous dimension and the anomalous dimension of the matter superfields in the rigid theory by direct summation of supergraphs . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that both these renormalization group functions are defined in terms of the bare coupling constant , so that the considered nsvz - like relation is valid independently of the subtraction scheme in the case of using the higher derivative regularization . </S>",
    "<S> the factorization of integrals defining the photino mass renormalization into integrals of double total derivatives is verified by an explicit two - loop calculation . </S>"
