    "in the study of dynamic magnetotransport behaviors of low - dimensional electron systems ( ldess ) , such as two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess),@xcite quantum wires ( qws)@xcite , and anti quantum dots ( qds),@xcite a microwave vector detection system , which can measure both the amplitude and the phase variations of the signals under the influence of the ldess in magnetic fields , is indispensable .",
    "usually people use a conventional vector network analyzer ( vna ) as such a detection system by virtues of its expediency and broadband characteristics .",
    "the ldes under test can be either embedded in the slots of a coplanar waveguide ( cpw),@xcite attached to a resonator,@xcite or directly connected to a coaxial cable;@xcite then the transmission or reflection property can be measured , and the transport properties of the ldes can be extracted therefrom , as the external magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) , or the temperature ( @xmath1 ) changes . however , since in most of these studies the ldes is placed in a very cold environment with temperature ( @xmath1 ) below 4.2 k , or even down to several tens of minikelvins , the power of the excitation signal must be very low , normally below @xmath260 dbm , to avoid joule heating .",
    "moreover , the power reaching the detection system is even lower due to the loss of coaxial cables and the sample itself .",
    "hence the resolution of the data , in particular the phase part , becomes very poor .    in this article , we present the instrumentation and the details of circuit design of a very - high - sensitivity vector detection system,@xcite incorporating phase - locked loop ( pll ) and double pulse techniques . here",
    "we mainly emphasize on the application of this system to the study of ldess embedded in the slots of a cpw , which have been successfully used as broadband sensors.@xcite our method is especially useful for the case of qds or qws , whose relatively small effective area compared to 2des samples usually results in a very small variation on the transmission coefficient of the cpw sample , and makes the conventional vna measurement very formidable and impractical .    in a typical modern vna , a pll",
    "is only used in the very front end of its superheterodyne receiver@xcite to make the local oscillator ( lo ) of the first - stage mixers follow the reference signal from the tracking source , and thus to preserve the phase information in the detected signal .",
    "in contrast , we put the cpw sample under test in the high - frequency signal path of a pll , which is renowned for its phase sensitivity , and obtain a great improvement in the phase resolution .",
    "as a matter of fact , the pll - based phase detection technique has been applied in the study of 2dess using surface acoustic wave ( saw).@xcite we improve the design of their measurement system , including a better pulse averaging part , a homodyne amplitude detection part and a loop filter of the pll , and also replace the saw transducers with a coaxial cable delay line and a broadband cpw containing a ldes under test .",
    "all these result in a very sensitive microwave vector detection system , which can be operated with extremely low power levels through samples , making this system very suitable for low - temperature applications .",
    "this system has been used to study the dynamic magnetotransport properties of a qw - array embedded in a cpw@xcite with an average power below -65 dbm into the sample at 0.3 k , and the resolution of the data , including both the amplitude and phase variations , surpassed what most of the commercial vnas can get at such a low power level .",
    "we have also used this method to obtain very clean data of the high - frequency longitudinal conductivity , including both the real and the imaginary parts , of a 2des in the quantum hall plateau .",
    "the principle of phase detection by a pll@xcite is quite straightforward . two semirigid coaxial cables of total length",
    "@xmath3 connect the pll and the cpw sample .",
    "the pll can tune its operation frequency ( @xmath4 ) to ensure the sum ( @xmath5 ) of the phase change of the semirigid cables ( @xmath6 ) and the cpw sample ( @xmath7 ) to be 0 , i.e. @xmath8 , or @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath6 can be easily obtained from @xmath10 or @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the angular frequency ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 the phase velocity of the signal in the cable , and @xmath15 the delay time of the coaxial cable .",
    "thereby we can obtain @xmath7 directly from measuring the frequency change ( @xmath16 ) of the pll via @xmath17       +    figure 1 shows the complete schematic diagram of the detection system , consisting of the pulse handling part , the microwave pll , and the amplitude readout part , together with the cpw sample in a cryogenic environment .",
    "the main microwave components of this system are basically a pair of homodyne mixers ( m1 and m2 ) with different reference signals of quadrature phase difference generated by a 90  hybrid ( h ) .",
    "the signal from the sample is divided equally into two part by a power divider ( d ) .",
    "the mixer m1 with a 0  reference ( _ _ lo__1 ) , used as the phase sensitive detector ( psd ) , has zero output ( _ _ if__1 ) forced by the pll , and at the same time the other mixer m2 with a 90  reference ( _ _ lo__2 ) has an output ( _ _ if__2 ) proportional to the amplitude of the signal .",
    "+    to reduce the signal power level and increase the signal to noise ratio , besides homodyne detection we also employ a double - pulse modulation scheme to detect and average the microwave signal .",
    "figure 2 shows the sequence of the controlling pulses and some other related outputs . a short pulse train [ _ gp _ in fig .",
    "2(b ) ] with a 0.2@xmath182 @xmath19s pulse width and a 0.1@xmath1810% duty cycle , provided by a pulse generator ( pg in fig.1 ) and gated by a slow square - wave ttl signal ( _ _ ttl__1 ) shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) with a period of 1@xmath1810 ms from a lock - in amplifier , modulates the microwave signal sent to the sample .",
    "a time - delayed pulse ( _ sp _ ) with a 0.2@xmath181 @xmath19s pulse width , triggered by the modulating pulses , controls a sample - and - hold ( s&h ) circuit that samples the if output ( _ ifo _ ) of the microwave mixer .",
    "the output of the s&h circuit ( _ sho _ ) is set to zero by an analog switch when the ttl gating signal is low .",
    "the output of the s&h circuit has the same characteristic frequency as the signal _ _",
    "ttl__1 , and hence can be averaged and read out by the lock - in amplifier .",
    "we use two sets of pulse averaging circuits in this system , one for the pll part and the other for the amplitude detection part .",
    "even though the lock - in amplifiers therein are synchronized at the same operating frequency , their averaging time constants are different . the time constant of lockin1 in the pll is about 1@xmath1810 ms for fast loop dynamics , in contrast to 300 ms or 1 s of lockin2 in the amplitude readout part for low average noise .",
    "the average of the psd output ( _ _ if__1 ) is then sent to an integrator ( loop filter of pll ) , whose output is connected to the frequency modulation ( fm ) input of the microwave source ( sg ) , i.e. the vco of the pll , and thus the loop is closed .",
    "the short pulse trains used in this system are provided by a simple single - channel pulse generator tpg110 from tti@xcite , which can generate a short reference pulse train ( _ syn _ in fig .",
    "2 ) and a pulse train ( _ sp _ ) with tunable time delay ( relative to _ syn _ ) , pulse width , and duty cycle , and a homemade pulse shaping circuit ( fig .",
    "3 ) , which converts the 30-ns - width reference pulses ( _ syn _ ) to the gating pulses ( _ gp _ ) with 0.2@xmath182 @xmath19s pulse width that are sent to a diode switch ( s ) to modulate the microwave signal .",
    "a lock - in amplifier ( lockin1 ) , sr830 from srs,@xcite sends a slow ttl square - wave reference ( _ _ ttl__1 ) to the `` trigger / gate in '' input of tpg110 .",
    "another lock - in amplifier ( lockin2 ) is externally locked to lockin1 and used to read the if output of m2 ( _ _ if__2 ) .",
    "s pulse from a 30-ns input pulse.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the simple pulse shaping circuit in fig . 3 consists of a bjt switch ( 2n3904 ) , a cmos and a ttl invertors .",
    "during the 30-ns duration given by _ syn _ pulses , 2n3904 is turned on and allows certain amount of charge ( set by r2 and r3 ) to flow into c1 and the ttl output ( _ gp _ ) will be set to high from low . afterwards",
    "the voltage across c1 ( _ _ vc__1 ) drops below 2.5 v due to the discharging current through r1 ( in series with a 1 k@xmath20 resistor ) , that triggering the following invertors to switch their statuses and thus making the output ( _ gp _ ) back to low . the width of the output pulse can be tuned via the variable resistor r1 , and the tunable range of the pulse width",
    "can be adjusted by r2 and r3 .",
    "+    each if output of the mixers ( m1 and m2 ) is low - pass filtered and then amplified by a pulse amplifier before fed into the sample - and - hold circuit .",
    "the low - pass filters used here are plp-5 ( @xmath215mhz ) or plp-70 ( @xmath2170mhz ) from mini - circuits,@xcite depending on the pulse width of the gating pulse ( _ gp _ ) . for the pulse amplifier",
    ", we use a high - speed low - noise operational amplifier max4107@xcite connected in a non - inverted configuration as shown in fig .",
    "its rise / fall time is well below 10 ns for a typical pulse height ( @xmath221 v ) in our application .",
    "+    the sample - and - hold circuit is shown in fig .",
    "we use a high - speed sample - and - hold amplifier ic ha-5320 - 5,@xcite which provides a 100 ns rise time and a 25 ns aperture time , and a fast analog switch adg201hs@xcite followed by a buffer buf04@xcite . the main output of tpg110 ( _ sp _ )",
    "is connected to the s / h control ( lead 14 ) of ha-5320 - 5 , and the slow reference _",
    "_ ttl__1 from lockin1 controls adg201hs and makes the output _",
    "zero as _ _ ttl__1 goes low.@xcite     +    a simple integrator shown in fig .",
    "6 serves as the loop filter of the pll .",
    "the integration time constant ( @xmath23 ) is about 23 ms , which is chosen to be higher then the time constant of lockin1 such that the dynamics of the pll is mainly controlled by this integrator .",
    "two sets of series - connected diodes ( d1 ) are connected in parallel from the output of the integrator to the ground with inverted polarities and used as a voltage limiter to protect the fm input of the microwave generator ( sg ) .",
    "a manual switch is used to reset the integrator while the pll is saturated or unlocked .",
    "r5 gives the pll an adequate damping that may attenuate unwanted oscillations in the loop .",
    "the dynamic properties of this pll system will be discussed later in sec .",
    "we use several sets of microwave modules to cover the frequency range from about 100 mhz to 18 ghz .",
    "table i lists the model numbers of the modules ( including the vendors in the footnotes@xcite ) according to their operation band . please note that the amplifers ( a ) includes a front - end low - noise preamplifier ( lna ) and subsequent amplifiers to make the total gain about 60 db . to cover the whole band , we use two lnas with noise figure ( nf ) better then 1.4 db and 2.2 db for frequency range 0.1@xmath188 ghz and 6@xmath1818 ghz , respectively .",
    "the microwave signal source ( sg ) used here is model e4421b ( 250k-3ghz ) or e8254a ( 250k-40ghz ) from agilent,@xcite both with fm bandwidth down to dc .",
    "cband + ( ghz )    & diode switch ( s ) &    c mixer + ( m1 & m2 )    & 90  hybrid ( h ) & divider ( o ) & lna + amp ( a ) &    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      +     + @xmath24 mini - circuits ; @xmath25 miteq ; @xmath26 quinstar ; @xmath27 m / a com ; @xmath28 pulsar microwave ; @xmath29 agilent .",
    "the response of this pll system is mainly controlled by four parameters , the power of the signal from the sample back to the lna , the sensitivity of lockin1 ( @xmath30 ) , the fm deviation per volt ( @xmath31 , with unit hz / v ) of the vco , and the total length of the semirigid coaxial cables , all of which can be tuned by the instrumental setting in our design .",
    "the length of the semirigid cables affects the delay time @xmath15 in eq .",
    "1 . we can measure @xmath15 precisely with this pll system itself without using an additional conventional vna or time domain reflectometer ( tdr ) . in the unlock condition ,",
    "i.e. with fm off in sg ( vco ) , we recorded the output of lockin1 ( or lockin2 ) as a function of frequency @xmath4 , and the result can be expressed as @xmath32 with @xmath33 the oscillation amplitude , and @xmath34 a relative phase factor .",
    "figure 7(a ) shows the oscillations for both lockin1 and lockin2 near @xmath4 = 1.2 ghz with only a 10.4-m semirigid cable and no sample connected to the pll system between the attenuator ( at ) and a in fig.1 .",
    "as expected , the oscillations of these two channels are 90  out of phase due to the lo phase difference of two mixers . from the `` frequency '' of these oscillations",
    ", we can directly estimate @xmath15 to be 53.3 ns .",
    "figure 7(b ) shows that @xmath15 is a linear function of the length of the semirigid cable with a finite intercept , about 2.6 ns , on the vertical axis .",
    "this extra delay time corresponding to a zero - length cable can be attributed to the time delay in the microwave modules .",
    "the peak power of the microwave signals used in these tests is -70 dbm .     versus length ( @xmath3 ) of the semirigid cable.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "+    the phase change of the cpw device in the experiment is the product of the output of the integrator @xmath35 in the pll , @xmath31 and @xmath15 while keeping the pll in the locked condition .",
    "@xmath36 is in fact the change in the frequency ( @xmath16 ) of the vco , which can also be measured by a microwave counter .",
    "@xmath31 of the signal source may affect the phase resolution : the smaller is the fm deviation set , the higher is the phase sensitivity . however , if @xmath31 is set too small , the pll may saturate very easily ( the output of the integrator @xmath35 reaches @xmath37 or @xmath38 v ) , and the phase signal readout @xmath35 is also very noisy .",
    "usually @xmath31 needs to be set properly according to the dynamic range of the phase signal .    for low - temperature experiments , usually the signal power to the sample",
    "is set by a step attenuator and is chosen to be the highest value without any heating effect on the sample . for samples immersed in liquid he3 at 0.3 k",
    ", typically a peak power of -50 dbm microwave signal , equivalent to an average power of -65 to -80 dbm depending on the duty cycle of the modulating pulses , can be delivered to the sample without raising the sample temperature .",
    "the response time of the pll is affected by the total gain of the loop , which can be obtained from the amplitude of the oscillations in fig .",
    "7(a ) and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath33 can be easily controlled by @xmath30 of lockin1 , and this provides a very convenient method to control the response time of the pll during the experiment .",
    "figure 8 shows the step response for different value of @xmath30 . in this test",
    ", we also used a 10.4-m semirigid cable without sample attached to the pll system .",
    "@xmath31 was set at 1 mhz / v , the peak power of the microwave signal after the attenuator was -70 dbm , and the operation frequency was about 1.2 ghz .",
    "the step response was measured from the output of the integrator @xmath35 as function of time right before we increased the unmodulated frequency of sg by a step of 500 khz while the pll was kept in a locked condition .",
    "the rise time of the response can be tuned from 0.63 s for @xmath39 v to 0.015 s for @xmath40 mv , and at the same time the loop dynamic behavior is moved from an overdamped regime to a slightly underdamped regime .",
    "we also find that the fluctuation of the signal decreases as @xmath30 increases .",
    "there is apparently a tradeoff between the speed of the loop and the signal fluctuation .",
    "to gain an idea of the detection limit of this system , we measured the background noise in the phase signal with only a 5.4-m semirigid cable attached to the system .",
    "various microwave modules were used to cover the whole available frequency range .",
    "figure 9 shows the measured peak - to - peak phase fluctuation versus frequency for different peak power levels of the microwave signal after the step attenuator ( at ) together with the loss of the semirigid cable measured by a vna .",
    "the phase signal was read from @xmath35 and then multiplied by @xmath41 .",
    "the measured bandwidth is controlled by the time constant of the integrator ( 23 ms ) , equivalent to about 7 hz .",
    "@xmath30 was fixed at 500 mv and @xmath35 was set at 50 khz / v during this test .",
    "the modulating pulses had a 2 @xmath19s pulse width and a 1/75 duty cycle .",
    "the gating window of the s&h circuit was 350 ns .     +    the collected data shown in fig . 9",
    "indicate that below 5 ghz , even for the lowest peak power -90 dbm in our test , the phase fluctuation is still less than 0.0003 ; above 5 ghz to 18 ghz , the fluctuation is still controlled within about 0.002 .",
    "this noise level is remarkably low for such a low - power signal .",
    "here we want to note that to obtain the average power value we must further subtract about -21.8 dbm from the peak power value due to the low duty cycle .",
    "in fact , the signal power reaching the low - noise amplifier ( lna ) is even lower than the input value claimed above due to the loss of the cable as also shown in fig .",
    "this may explain the noise in phase increases at high frequencies .",
    "the resolution with a low-@xmath1 sample loaded is slightly worse due to the loss of the sample and extra noise from the cryogenic environment .",
    "the resolution of the amplitude readout for a small - variation signal can be enhanced by the use of the `` offset '' and `` expand '' functions of the lock - in amplifier.@xcite     tested with different power levels .",
    "the loss of a 5.4-m semirigid cable is also shown for comparison.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +      in the following we will present measured results for a 2des sample ( sample a ) and a qw array sample ( sample b ) to demonstrate the capability of this system .",
    "the 2des in the sample a is confined in a 20-nm - wide modulation - doped in@xmath42ga@xmath43as quantum well grown on gaas substrate by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) technique . the quantum well",
    "is separated from a 260 nm al@xmath44ga@xmath45as si - doped layer by a 15-nm gaas and a 5 nm al@xmath44ga@xmath45as undoped spacer layers .",
    "this 2des has an electron density of @xmath46 @xmath47 and a mobility of about @xmath48 @xmath49v s at 0.3 k. a 50-@xmath20 ( @xmath50 ) meandering cpw made of au(300 nm)/ti(10 nm ) with a 36 @xmath19 m wide central conductor and a 23 @xmath19 m gap ( @xmath51 ) between the central conductor and the ground plane at both sides is manufactured on the surface of the substrate .",
    "the effective length @xmath52 of the meandering cpw is 2.25 cm .",
    "the sample is immersed in liquid @xmath53he ( 0.3 k ) with applied @xmath0 perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "the real part and the imaginary part of the longitudinal conductivity can be deduced from the relative amplitude change@xcite of the microwave signal ( @xmath54 ) and the phase difference@xcite obtained from eq .",
    "1 , respectively , via    @xmath55    and @xmath56    figure 10 shows the re@xmath57 and im@xmath57 of the sample a at 6.99 ghz for @xmath0 between 3 and 10 t. the scale bar on the plot is 10 @xmath19s for both curves .",
    "the peak power into the sample was about -85 dbm , and the equivalence average power was only about -105 dbm .",
    "the re@xmath57 curve shows clear broad minima near zero conductance around integer landau level filling factors ( @xmath58 ) , while the im@xmath57 curve exhibits a concave shape in the plateau regime and a deep minimum in the transition region between adjacent hall states .",
