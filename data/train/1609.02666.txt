    "recently a new model of restricted @xmath0-gravity has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "this proposal is based on the idea of a mild breaking of the diffeomorphism invariance of the four- dimensional @xmath0 gravity .",
    "recall that @xmath5-gravity is described by the action @xmath6 + s_{matter } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "this action is invariant under the full four - dimensional diffeomorphism by construction . in order to find the restricted form of @xmath0-gravity",
    ", it is useful to introduce the @xmath9-decomposition of the metric @xmath10 @xcite @xmath11 where we have defined @xmath12 as the inverse of the induced metric @xmath13 on the cauchy surface @xmath14 at each time @xmath15 , @xmath16 and we denote @xmath17 .",
    "the four - dimensional scalar curvature in @xmath9 formalism has the form @xmath18 where the extrinsic curvature of the spatial hypersurface @xmath14 at the time @xmath15 is defined as @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the covariant derivative determined by the metric @xmath13 , and where the de witt metric is defined as @xmath21 with inverse @xmath22 which obeys the relation @xmath23 further , @xmath24 is the future - pointing unit normal vector to the hypersurface @xmath14 , which is written in terms of the adm variables as @xmath25 in order to formulate the restricted @xmath0-gravity we break the full diffeomorphism invariance of the @xmath0-gravity by performing the replacement @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a dimensionless parameter that controls the breaking of the diffeomorphism invariance of the action .",
    "even if the shift ( [ i-2 ] ) seems to be very mild , it turns out that it has significant impact on the hamiltonian structure of this theory as was shown in @xcite .",
    "careful analysis performed there showed that in order to have a consistent theory from the hamiltonian analysis point of view , it is necessary to include terms which depend on the spatial derivative of the lapse @xmath28 into the action .",
    "further , the breaking of the diffeomorphism invariance suggests the possibility to define theory with the generalized de witt metric @xcite @xmath29 in summary , we proposed in @xcite the extended form of the restricted @xmath0-gravity when we performed the replacement @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the corresponding coupling constants .",
    "we showed there that this theory is consistent from the hamiltonian analysis point of view since the structure of constraints is the same as in case of non - projectable hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , for the hamiltonian analysis , see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "we also analyzed cosmological solutions of the restricted @xmath0-gravity and we found new solutions whose properties depend on the value of the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that some of these solutions can not be found in the diffeomorphism invariant @xmath0-gravity .    due to the fact that there are new cosmological solutions ,",
    "it is natural to investigate them in more details .",
    "the aim of this paper is to focus on the analysis of the cosmological fluctuations of the restricted @xmath0-gravity .",
    "as the first step we determine the background equations from the restricted @xmath0-gravity action when we focus on i a time - dependent ansatz . then we analyze the fluctuations above this background . due to the fact that the scalar , vector and tensor fluctuations decouple at the quadratic order we can analyze each kind of the fluctuations separately .",
    "we show that the restricted @xmath0-gravity differs from the standard @xmath0-gravity in the scalar sector , while the vector and tensor sectors have the same properties as in the case of diffeomorphism invariant @xmath0-gravity .",
    "more precisely , we show that with suitable choice of parameters the restricted @xmath0-gravity allows to explain recent observation data that predict the possibility of the existence of a non - zero anisotropic stress ( see for example @xcite . ) .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ( [ second ] )",
    "we briefly review the equations of motion of the restricted @xmath0-gravity evaluated on the time - dependent cosmological solution . in section ( [ third ] ) we analyze the fluctuations above this background and in section ( [ fourth ] ) we discuss our results with relation to the recent phenomenological observations .",
    "finally , in conclusion ( [ fifth ] ) we outline our results .",
    "in this section we derive the equations of motion for the restricted @xmath0-gravity when we presume the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) form of the background . recall that the restricted @xmath32-gravity action has the form @xmath33+s_{matter } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 is defined in ( [ repla ] ) .",
    "the matter part contributes to the gravitational equations of motion through the stress - energy tensor which is defined as @xmath35 our goal is to analyze the spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe so that the metric ansatz is the frw metric which has the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lapse and @xmath38 is the scale factor . as usual ,",
    "the hubble parameter is defined as @xmath39 .",
    "note that we can not set @xmath40 from the beginning due to the restricted form of the diffeomorphism .",
    "but , since for the background equations all quantities depend only on time , one can use redefinition of time in to set @xmath41 in the background equations .",
    "we also presume matter in the form of a prefect fluid which means that the stress - energy tensor has the form @xmath42 since we presume that the full diffeomorphism is broken in the gravitational sector only we find that the matter action is diffeomorphism invariant . as a result",
    "the stress - energy tensor is conserved in the sense @xmath43 on the condition that the matter satisfies the equation of motion .",
    "now for the background ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) we obtain @xmath44 so that the conservation of the stress - energy tensor implies the standard conservation equation @xmath45 using ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) and the general relations in the adm formalism , which are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can show that @xmath46 the generalized friedmman equation for the model has been determined in @xcite as @xmath47 where @xmath48 note that we have defined prime as derivative with respect to the argument of @xmath49 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath50 are dimensionless quantities .",
    "finally , we note that there is still another equation after performing the time derivative of eq . and then use eq .",
    "@xmath51 after this brief review of the background equations we now switch to the main topic of this paper which is the analysis of the cosmological perturbations .",
    "the goal of this section is to derive equations for the perturbed frw space - time in the arnowitt - deser - misner(adm ) formalism . as a check of the validity of our approach",
    ", we note that for @xmath52 and @xmath53 the results derived in this paper should reduce to the corresponding results of the standard @xmath54 gravity , see for example the review @xcite .    to begin with , we emphasize that we are writing our equations in the newtonian gauge which is defined by @xmath55 .",
    "we use the newtonian gauge for the following reason : as it has been argued in @xcite , one of the advantages of the newtonian gauge is that the physical fields which are defined by the gauge fixing , coincide with the gauge - invariant variables .",
    "note also that it is an easy task to move from the newtonian gauge to other gauges @xcite .",
    "finally , note that due to the fact that the spatial section of the metric ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) is flat , it is natural to use the fourier decomposition of the perturbation where the fourier components of a general perturbation @xmath56 are defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "further , we also decompose @xmath59 and @xmath60 into the homogeneous and perturbed parts as @xmath61 where @xmath62 over any quantity shows the unperturbed part of that quantity . in the case of the fluctuations of the matter we use the following parameterization for the perturbed energy - momentum tensor @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the potential for the spatial velocity of the fluid . +      before we proceed to the study of the perturbed equations it is instructive to discuss the role of diffeomorphism symmetry in the cosmological context .",
    "+ for a full diffeomorphism invariant model , as for example the einstein - hilbert action or @xmath0gravity action , there is no a priori preferred coordinate system .",
    "of course the symmetry can be broken by imposing other restrictions on the model .",
    "for example , in the cosmological context , it has been shown that the only coordinate system(observer ) that is compatible with the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of space is described by the frw metric @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness of frw metric helps us to choose it as the background metric for our model in this paper .",
    "but , the uniqueness of the metric is broken if we consider universe which is not homogeneous . the deviation from homogeneity",
    "is considered as the perturbed frw metric .",
    "for example , the scalar metric perturbations can be parameterized as @xcite @xmath65dx^{i}dx^{j } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66,@xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are @xmath70scalars .",
    "+ it is an unnecessary and senseless task to insert the above expression into general equations of motion in order to obtain the equations of motion for these @xmath70scalars .",
    "the reason for this statement is that , similar to the model with the full diffeomorphism symmetry , here we confront with the so - called gauge problem .",
    "the problem arises when we note that the model is invariant under the coordinate transformation as @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . under this transformation",
    "the components of the metric ( [ note - add ] ) transform as @xcite @xmath74 therefore , even if we tried to obtain the equations for the components of eq .",
    ", we would have some solutions which are unphysical in the sense that they can be derived by application of the transformation ( [ note - add1 ] ) on some particular solutions . in order to avoid the above problem , i.e. the gauge problem",
    ", one can choose a specific gauge ( coordinate ) or use the gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "in the process of the gauge fixing , values for @xmath75 and @xmath76 are explicitly specified such that we have not any residual symmetry for the solution . _ physically , gauge fixing means that a specific spatial coordinate has been chosen_. + in the following we will work with the newtonian gauge .",
    "the newtonian gauge is defined as the perturbed metric for observers who are immobile at the hypersurfaces of constant time . also , the normal vector of the hypersurfaces are the same as the worldlines of the observers at any time .",
    "thus , the newtonian gauge is described by @xcite @xmath77dx^{i}dx^{j } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the newtonian gauge is the preferred gauge for the late - time cosmology as was argued in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will use it to compare the results of our model with the plank observations .",
    "finally we should emphasize that it is still possible to construct the gauge invariant quantities form the newtonian gauge variables @xcite .",
    "+ to proceed further , we note that it is convenient to parameterize the scalar metric perturbations in the newtonian gauge as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are space and time dependent . using these definitions in ( [ repla ] )",
    "we easily find @xmath81 as a check , we note that for @xmath82 the above relation reduces to the background form of @xmath83 given in eq .. now by performing the linearization of the expression ( [ rper ] ) , we obtain fourier component of @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "further , inserting ( [ fl1 ] ) and ( [ defnfluc ] ) into the equation ( [ consten ] ) and by performing the corresponding linearization , we obtain two equations @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "note that these equations have the same forms as the corresponding equations for the usual @xmath90 gravity . in order to derive the remaining equations , we proceed in the following way . to begin with ,",
    "we insert into the action . as we pointed out we work in the newtonian gauge .",
    "then in order to vary the action with respect to the shift , it is sufficient to consider the terms which are proportional to @xmath91 and @xmath92 . for example , if we define @xmath93 as a variation with respect to the shift then for @xmath94 we obtain @xmath95 using this result and also using the following relations @xmath96 and after some integration by parts we obtain @xmath97 \\partial_{i}n_{i}(1 + 2\\eta\\bar{f})-4 a \\eta m_{p}^{2}\\int d^{4}x a h n_{i}\\partial_{i}\\delta f\\\\ & -2\\eta\\upsilon m_{p}^{2}\\int d^{4}x a[n_{i}\\partial_{i}\\dot{\\delta f}-\\partial_{i}\\phi n_{i}\\dot{\\bar{f}}-3h n_{i}\\partial_{i}\\delta f]+ s_{matter } \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] further on , performing the variation with respect to @xmath98 and using the fourier components of the perturbations we obtain @xmath99 -\\frac{1}{2m_{p}^{2}}\\delta q \\ .\\ ] ] in case of the variation of the action with respect to @xmath79 we set @xmath100 in the action and then expand the action up to the second order in @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this procedure , after some integration be parts and using eq .",
    ", leads to @xmath101 \\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] so that we easily find the fourier form of the equation of motion for @xmath79 @xmath102\\delta f -3\\upsilon\\eta\\dot{\\bar{f}}(2h\\phi+\\dot{\\psi})\\\\ & + 3\\eta\\upsilon h\\dot{\\delta f}-\\frac{\\delta\\rho}{2m_{p}^{2 } } = ( 3a\\phi h^{2}+\\frac{k^{2}}{a^{2}}\\psi + 3ah\\dot{\\psi}-\\gamma_{1}\\frac{k^{2}}{2 a^{2}}\\phi)(1 + 2\\eta\\bar{f } ) \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] for reasons that will become clear later we derive @xmath103 in two different ways . in the first case we use and . then in order to eliminate @xmath104 in these formula , we use . collecting these pieces together",
    "we obtain an equation @xmath105\\delta f\\\\ & + \\big[\\dot{\\phi}h+2a\\dot{h}\\phi+a\\ddot{\\psi}+3a\\phi h^{2}+3ah\\dot{\\psi}+\\frac{k^2}{3a^{2}}(\\psi - a\\phi)\\\\ & \\hspace{.15cm}+(1-a)\\frac{k^{2}}{3ha^{2}}\\dot{\\psi}- \\gamma_{1}\\frac{k^{2}}{6a^{2}}(\\frac{\\dot{\\phi}}{h\\phi}+1)\\phi\\big](1 + 2\\eta \\bar{f } ) \\ , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we also used the fact that @xmath106 .",

    "in this section we focus on the metric tensor perturbations @xmath114 . recall that the perturbed line element has the form @xmath115dx^{i}dx^{j},\\ ] ] where @xmath116 . in order to derive equations in this sector",
    "we use the fact that @xmath117 does not contain the metric tensor perturbations up to the second order .",
    "further , using the traceless condition on @xmath114 it is easy to show that the metric perturbations do not appear in @xmath118 .",
    "thus , it turns out that the terms in which are proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath119 do not contribute to the metric tensor perturbations . as a result",
    "the analysis of this sector is very similar to the analysis of tensor fluctuations in standard @xmath0 gravity .",
    "explicitly , the second order action for these modes has the form @xmath120\\big[a \\gamma_{ij}\\partial^{2}\\gamma_{ij}+a^{3}\\dot{\\gamma}_{ij}^{2 } \\big ] \\ .\\ ] ] then in order to avoid the ghost instability we must impose the following condition @xmath121 performing variation of with respect to @xmath114 and using the following fourier representation @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 , leads to the second order differential equation for @xmath125 @xmath126+(\\frac{k}{a})^{2}\\gamma_{k}^{s}=0\\ ] ] which has the same form as in the standard @xmath0-gravity .      in this section",
    "we perform an analysis of vector metric perturbations . as in the case of the prefect fluid we consider the following form of the perturbed stress - tensor in the vector sector @xmath127",
    "then from @xmath128 it follows that @xmath129 as in case of the metric perturbations the favorite gauge in this sector is the so - called vector gauge which is defined by @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "again , from the above definition and the condition on @xmath132 it turns out that the terms in which are proportional to @xmath27 do not contribute in this sector . then the second order action takes the following form @xmath133 then it is easy to see that the equation for @xmath132 in the fourier space has the form @xmath134 which coincides with the equation for the vector perturbation in the standard @xmath0-gravity .",
    "in this section we explore some phenomenological implications of our results . in this section",
    "we take @xmath110 that corresponds to @xmath109 .",
    "note that this is a natural presumption , since it is expected that @xmath119 should approach to @xmath135 in the low energy regime @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the einstein - hilbert gravity predicts @xmath136 . in the more general case",
    "when @xmath137 , it is useful to define an anisotropic stress , @xmath138 as @xmath139 clearly a non - vanishing anisotropic stress is the signature of modification of general relativity @xcite . further , it is also convenient to define @xmath140 so that the einstein - hilbert gravity predicts @xmath141 . + but , from the planck cmb temperature data ,",

    "<S> we show that it is possible to construct a restricted model of gravity , in which the background equations are the same as the equations of motion which are derived from the einstein - hilbert action with the cosmological constant term . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the deviation from the einstein - hilbert model emerges in the perturbed equations , for which we have a non - vanishing anisotropic stress . </S>",
