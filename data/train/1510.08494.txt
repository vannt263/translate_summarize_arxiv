    "multi - frequency electrical impedance tomography ( mfeit ) is a noninvasive method to provide the images of the conductivity and permittivity at various frequencies ranging from 1 khz to 1 mh inside an electrically conducting object @xcite .",
    "recently , multi - frequency imaging techniques have been paid considerable attention due to their advantages in probing thin insulating inhomogeneities with their widths .",
    "their potential applications include biomedical imaging to probe biological tissues comprising insulating cell membranes @xcite and non - destructive testing ( ndt ) to probe insulating cracks @xcite .    in mfeit , we inject ac currents using surface electrodes to produce the time - harmonic electrical field inside the imaging object .",
    "the induced electrical field is determined by the distribution of effective conductivity and permittivity , the geometry of the object , electrode positions , the applied frequency , and others @xcite . in the presence of thin insulating inhomogeneities or insulating membranes",
    ", the time - harmonic electrical potential near these inhomogeneities varies significantly with the applied frequency .",
    "in particular , the potential jump across the thin insulating inhomogeneities changes a lot with frequency , because currents pass through a thin insulating inhomogeneity as frequency increases .",
    "those variations with frequency are conveyed to the boundary voltages @xcite .",
    "multi - frequency eit ( mfeit ) can take advantage of this frequency - dependent behavior to measure tissue anomalies and thin insulating inhomogeneities with their thickness .",
    "one challenging issue is how to link the spectroscopic information obtained from mfeit to the structural information of an imaging object containing thin insulating inhomogeneities .",
    "we need to describe the role of the thin insulating inhomogeneities by understanding the frequency - dependent interplays between the real and imaginary parts of the complex potentials due to the change of the refraction along the thin insulating inhomogeneities as frequency varies .",
    "this paper deals with this challenging issue of the spectroscopic mfeit by means of rigorous mathematical analysis with both numerical and experimental validations .",
    "we start with the simplest model of a linear - shaped thin insulating inhomogeneity with a uniform thickness , in order to provide a basis of the rigorous expression on the frequency - dependent behavior of the potential due to the influence of thin insulating inhomogeneities . through a rigorous asymptotic analysis",
    ", we provide the behavior of the time - harmonic potential @xmath0 across the linear inhomogeneity with respect to angular frequency @xmath1 . to be precise , the frequency - dependent variation of the exterior normal derivative @xmath2 on the boundary of the inhomogeneity can be approximately described in terms of the thickness ( @xmath3 ) , the contrast ratio between the background admittivity @xmath4 and the inhomogeneity permittivity @xmath5 : @xmath6\\right| } { |(\\sigma_b+i\\omega\\epsilon_b)/\\ep_c|}.\\ ] ]    assuming the above approximation for a more general shape of thin insulators , we could get better understanding on spectroscopic admittivity images being reconstructed from standard mfeit algorithm . in a special case of inclusions",
    "( highly conducting disks and linear insulating segments ) inside the imaging object , we derive a formula for detecting both inhomogeneities .",
    "finally , various numerical simulations are performed at multiple frequencies to give spectroscopic reconstructed images .",
    "using spectroscopic images , an integrated image based on principle component analysis ( pca ) is presented .",
    "in addition , we take use of swisstom eit - pioneer set to carry out phantom experiments at a frequency range from 50khz to 250khz .",
    "for rigorous analysis , we use the simplified two - dimensional model by considering axially symmetric cylindrical sections under the assumption that the out - of - plane current density is negligible in an imaging slice . we assume a two dimensional electrically conducting domain @xmath7 with its connected @xmath8-boundary @xmath9 .",

    "since the conductivity @xmath10 and permittivity @xmath16 change abruptly across the thin objects and conductive objects , we denote @xmath17 because the thin objects @xmath18 are highly insulating , we consider the following extreme contrast case : @xmath19 in the frequency range below 1mhz ( @xmath20 ) , we inject a sinusoidal current @xmath21 at @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnitude of the current density on @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 with @xmath27 being the duality pair between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the injected current produces the time - harmonic potential @xmath0 in @xmath7 which is dictated by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the admittivity distribution , @xmath32 is the outward unit normal vector on @xmath24 , and @xmath33 is the normal derivative . setting @xmath34 , we can obtain a unique solution @xmath0 to ( [ eq : uw ] ) from the lax - milgram theorem .",
    "hence , we can define the neumann - to - dirichlet map @xmath35 by @xmath36 . using @xmath37channel multi - frequency eit system , we may inject @xmath38 number of linearly independent currents at several angular frequencies @xmath39 and measure the induced corresponding boundary voltages .",
    "we collect these current - voltage data @xmath40 at various frequencies ranging from 10hz to 1mhz .",

    "the influence of thin insulating objects on the boundary measurements decreases as the frequency increase .",
    "the dominant influence at low frequencies is from insulating objects while the boundary potential is dominated by conductive objects at high frequencies .",
    "now we are considering to construct an integrated image based on an investigation of principal component analysis ( pca ) where the information of both thin insulating objects and small conductive objects can be extracted from the integrated image .",
    "pca is a useful tool in extracting the dominant features ( principal components ) from a set of reconstructed images at various frequencies @xcite . in order to implement this approach",
    ", we first obtain the reconstructed images at a broad range of frequencies @xmath272 and each reconstructed admittivity .",
    "then we represent each image by an @xmath273 column vector @xmath274 where @xmath275 .",
    "then average admittivity at @xmath1 can be defined as @xmath276 we define the mean oscillation of @xmath277 by the vector @xmath278 since the real part of admittivity is @xmath10 and its imaginary part is @xmath270 , we resolve the set of admittivities and deal with the real and imaginary part separately .",
    "let @xmath279 be the real part of @xmath280 .",
    "this set of vectors is then subject to principal component analysis which tries to find a set of @xmath281 orthogonal vectors and their associated eigenvalues .",

    "note that in practice , the number of frequencies ( @xmath281 ) is much smaller than the pixel number ( @xmath257 ) of the reconstructed images .",
    "therefore , we consider @xmath292 leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that are chosen as those with the largest associated eigenvalues , where @xmath293 depends on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr )",
    ". then the principal components for any admittivity image @xmath294 , can be written as @xmath295 for @xmath296 . here",

    "we use a cylindrical tank with 360 mm in diameter and 32 equally - spaced electrodes are attached .",
    "the tank is filled with agar - gelatin mixture . inside the phantom , there are two conductive objects with a diameter of 30 mm and four very thin kitchen wrap with 1 @xmath311 m thickness .",
    "one conductive object is encircled by four very thin kitchen wrap .",
    "we injected current of 1 ma at various frequencies of 50 khz , 100 khz , 150 khz , 180khz , 200 khz and 250 khz .",
    "figure [ fig : exp ] ( a ) presents the reconstructed images at six different frequencies .",
    "the insulating wraps appear as a solid object from 50 khz to 100 khz since currents can not penetrate the insulating wrap .",
    "as we expected by numerical experiments in the previous section , the insulating wrap starts to fade out at frequency 150 khz and totally disappear at 250khz .",
    "all the experimental results shown in figures [ fig : exp ] ( a ) are consistent with the numerical simulations in the previous section .    at ( 0,0 ) ;    as for the fusion of multi - frequency images , the experiments are conducted at a wide range of frequencies from 50khz to 250khz with a step size 10khz since the minimum frequency step of swisstom eit - pioneer set is fixed at 10khz .",
    "the integrated image is shown in figure [ fig : exp ] ( b ) where both two conductive objects and the surrounding insulating wrap are visible .",
    "in this work , we have provided a rigorous mathematical formula for the jump of potential and normal derivative across the thin linear - shaped insulating inhomogeneities based on layer potential techniques .",
    "the potential jump is related with the thickness of insulating objects as well as the current frequencies .",
    "based on these jump conditions , we have developed two asymptotic expansions for current - voltage data perturbations due to thin insulators and small conductors at various frequencies . using these two asymptotic expansions",
    ", we have mathematically shown that at high frequencies we can visualize the small conductors , while at low frequencies we can only get the information of thin insulators .",
    "based on this mathematical analysis , we conclude that multiple frequencies help us to handle the spectroscopy behavior of the current - voltage data with respect to thin insulators and small conductors .",
    "when the frequency increase from very low to very high , we can continuously observe the images of thin insulators ( low frequency ) , both thin insulators and small conductors ( not too low , not too high frequency ) , and only small insulators ( high frequency ) .",
