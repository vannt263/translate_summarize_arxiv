    "most of the term structure models in the literature are based on the fundamental assumption that bond prices @xmath0 together with a numraire bank account process @xmath1 form an arbitrage - free market . formally speaking this means that we can find an equivalent local martingale measure for the collection of stochastic processes @xmath2 representing bond prices discounted by the bank account s current value .",
    "if we assume additionally that those local martingales are indeed martingales , then we arrive at the famous relationship @xmath3\\ ] ] for @xmath4 .",
    "if we assume alternatively the existence of forward rates , we arrive at the heath - jarrow - morton ( hjm ) drift condition for the stochastic forward rate process encoding the previous local martingale property ( see @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "bank account processes are limits of roll - over constructions and therefore only approximately given in real markets .",
    "even if there is a bank account process it is not innocent to take it as numraire , since this is an assertion on available liquidity in arbitrary positive and negative multiples of the bank account process .",
    "therefore we avoid assumptions on even the existence of a bank account process and  in case of existence ",
    "we do not assume that it qualifies as numraire .",
    "this can be compared to the famous bgm market model approach , see @xcite , but with the goal in mind to fully characterize the absence of arbitrage .",
    "it might appear that this relaxation of assumptions leads to more general but possibly less interesting term structure models .",
    "however , we show that term structure models , where the bank account process does not qualify as numraire , appear to be a more natural choice leading even to simple interpretations of liquidity effects in the sense of multiple yield curves . in order to avoid ambiguities we also outline in some detail our view on change of numraire , bubbles , and liquidity .",
    "let us demonstrate our setting with an example lent from eckhard platen s benchmark approach .",
    "let @xmath5 denote a growth optimal portfolio on a finite time horizon @xmath6 .",
    "we claim this portfolio to be a numraire portfolio of our market , see section [ change_of_numeraire ] , i.e.  fair prices @xmath7 of payoffs @xmath8 at time @xmath9 should satisfy the martingale equation @xmath10\\ ] ] under appropriate integrability assumptions .",
    "in particular we obtain bond price processes from the equation @xmath11\\ ] ] for @xmath12 .",
    "if bond prices are bounded by @xmath13 , i.e.  in the case of non - negative interest rates , then the inverse growth optimal portfolio necessarily is a supermartingale , and vice versa .",
    "we recall that being a numraire means in our view that arbitrary positive and negative multiples of @xmath14 are available for trading . in this",
    "setting _ also _ the terminal bond @xmath15 qualifies as numraire , i.e.  we can find an equivalent martingale measure @xmath16 such that the processes @xmath17 are @xmath16-martingales for @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , define a density process via the properly normalized positive martingale @xmath19 , which is a martingale by construction , leading to the desired assertion .",
    "in other words : the benchmark approach leads to a bona fide bond market without frictions and free lunches .",
    "consider now the case where the growth optimal portfolio is exogenously given such that @xmath20 is a strict local martingale .",
    "furthermore we assume that the roll - over portfolio leads to the bank account process @xmath21 equal to @xmath13 even though the term structure will be non - trivial due to the strict local martingale property , see subsection [ benchmark - example ] for an example of these properties .",
    "in contrast the bank account process @xmath13 does not qualify as numraire , since @xmath20 , or equivalently @xmath22 is a strict local martingale .",
    "the bond market with respect to the numraire @xmath15 is free of ( asymptotic ) arbitrage in the classical sense , even if one adds the bank account process as additional traded asset , but we can not perform a change of numraire towards the numraire @xmath23 .",
    "an interesting aspect of the previous example stems from the introduction of virtual term structures related to bank account processes @xmath24 .",
    "we think here of the ( finite ) roll - over processes , i.e. , for a sequence of refining partitions @xmath25 of @xmath26 $ ] define , for each @xmath27 , @xmath28 notice the difference to definition [ rollover ] .",
    "we have @xmath29 as announced before , see subsection [ benchmark - example ] for a concrete example .",
    "these virtual term structures can be interpreted as high - liquidity term structures , which one would actually expect in the market if there was enough liquidity in the respective numraire : this amounts to pricing with the corresponding supermartingale deflator @xmath30 } \\frac{b^n_t}{p(t , t^ * ) }   \\frac{1}{b^n_t},\\ ] ] which is derived from changing measure by the local martingale density @xmath31 .",
    "when pricing @xmath13 at time @xmath32 with respect to this deflator we obtain an alternative term structure @xmath33 @xmath34 } \\frac{1}{b^n_t } \\big ] = & e_{q^ * } \\big [   \\frac{1}{p(t , t^ * ) } \\frac{1}{e_{q^*}[\\frac{b^n_t}{p(t , t^ * ) } ] } \\big ] \\\\",

    "p(0,t ) \\ , , \\ ] ] for each @xmath36 , i.e. , the virtual term structures show lower interest rates ( due to higher liquidity ) than @xmath0 . in case of @xmath37",
    "we apparently obtain the virtual term structure @xmath38 , which corresponds to the highest liquidity virtual term structure , with overnight borrowing at no cost available .",
    "it is the aim of this article to understand bond market dynamics under the weaker assumption that there are no arbitrages with respect to a terminal bond numraire .",
    "this is a minimal assumption , which appears to us  in light of the previous example  more appropriate .",
    "furthermore we would like to provide an explanation of multiple yield curves from our normative modeling approach : our suggestion in this direction is to look at change of numraire .",
    "from a mathematical point of view we believe that the technology of large financial markets is the right tool to understand the nature of arbitrage in the considered ( infinite - dimensional ) bond market , since we want to avoid artificially introduced trading strategies .",
    "more precisely , we fix a terminal maturity @xmath39 and consider the bond market ( for maturities @xmath40 ) with respect to the terminal bond as a numraire .",
    "it is only allowed to trade in a finite number of assets , but we can take more and more of them and so approximate a portfolio with an infinite number of assets .",
    "in contrast to , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite we do not introduce infinite  dimensional trading strategies but only approximate by finite portfolios , an idea which stems from the theory of large financial markets . as a direct consequence , we avoid pitfalls for measure - valued strategies pointed out in @xcite .",
    "a second advantage is that we are able to consider markets driven by general cdlg processes with only a weak regularity in maturity .",
    "this extends beyond semimartingale models as considered in the above mentioned articles and in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in section [ change_of_numeraire ] we introduce some basic ideas to the notion of numraire which will be of importance for the whole article . in section  [ section2 ] and [ section3 ]",
    "we introduce our model for a bond market with an appropriate interpretation as a large financial market and characterize notions of no arbitrage .",
    "in section  [ section4 ] we relate the appropriate no arbitrage assumption , which is no free lunch ( nfl ) on the bond market , to the global existence of an equivalent local martingale measure .",
    "indeed , we can prove the existence of an equivalent local martingale measure for all bonds with maturity @xmath40 in terms of the bond @xmath41 as numraire .",
    "this is in contrast to common bond market models in the literature which often start with the assumption of existence of an equivalent ( local ) martingale measure , whereas we directly define a notion of no arbitrage and then the existence of a local martingale measure follows .    in section  [ section6 ]",
    "we prove by a komls type argument that under the assumption of nafl there exists a candidate process for the bank account as a limit of convex combinations of roll - over bonds .",
    "this bank account is a supermartingale in terms of the terminal bond and therefore the bond market stays free of arbitrage when we add the bank account to the market .",
    "in section  [ section5 ] we will see that it is possible to further relax the assumptions on the bond market .",
    "if we only assume that the bond market does not allow asymptotic arbitrage opportunities of first kind ( aa1 ) in the sense of large financial markets as in @xcite , we can not guarantee the global existence of an equivalent local martingale measure .",
    "however , we can prove that there exists a strictly positive supermartingale deflator for each sequence of bonds with maturities that do not induce an aa1 .",
    "if there exists a dense sequence of maturities in @xmath26 $ ] , such that the induced large financial market is free of aa1 , then there exists a supermartingale deflator for the bond market with all maturities in @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "in this relaxed setting we can still show the existence of a generalized bank account as a limit of convex combinations of roll - over bonds , which is a supermartingale in terms of the terminal bond .",
    "this section is related to results of kostas kardaras , see , e.g. , @xcite    in section  [ section7 ] we illustrate the setup with four examples : first , we consider the example with optimal growth portfolio being a strict local martingale .",
    "second , a bond market model driven by fractional brownian motion is studied , where bond prices are not semimartingales , but bond prices in terms of the numraire are .",
    "third , we consider an extension of the heath - jarrow - morton approach where the bond prices as functions of the maturity are continuous but of unbounded variation such that a short - rate does not exist .",
    "fourth , we give an example illustrating possible pitfalls when considering limits of roll - overs as numraire : in a setting of not uniformly integrable bond prices , the limit of roll - overs does not qualify as numraire because it reaches zero with probability one .",
    "in this section we outline some basic definitions and conclusions on numraires , liquidity and bubbles , since from the next section changes of numraire will be used frequently .",
    "the goal of this section is to add some possibly new definition to the large literature on these issues , however , no deep results are proved .    in seminal works on the absence of arbitrage in financial markets",
    "the numraire ( portfolio ) plays a distinguished rle , see @xcite .",
    "additionally in markets with stochastic interest rates , or foreign exchange markets , change of numraire is an important technique .",
    "it turns out that the question which portfolios do qualify as numraire is surprisingly subtle and often only indirectly solved : usually one characterizes possible changes of numraire mathematically but _ no economically reasonable _ properties of numraire portfolios are laid down ( see for instance the seminal work @xcite , where numraire portfolios are characterized as maximal , admissible , strictly positive portfolios ) .",
    "we would like to close this small gap in the following paragraphs by providing a simple definition of numraire portfolios , which can be also mirrored in the world of bubbles and liquidity , and which still makes sense in discrete time and under trading constraints .",
    "intuitively , a portfolio can be used as numraire if it is strictly positive and allows for short - selling , i.e.  the investor is able to find a reasonable counterparty from whom the portfolio can be borrowed and she sells it then on the market .",
    "short - selling might require arbitrarily high credit lines when the portfolio is to be returned , so the counterparty faces the risk of the investor s bankruptcy . mathematically speaking this",
    "might lead to arbitrages in the virtual world after a change of numraire ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence some conditions on the behavior of the short - sold portfolio from below must be imposed .",
    "on the other hand we do not want to bound the short - sold portfolio from below by some number , hence the usual admissibility condition is too strong . instead of admissibility of the short - sold portfolio we require a uniform integrability condition with respect to some equivalent local martingale measure .",
    "in other words : we extend the notion of traded portfolios a bit beyond admissibility and call a strictly positive portfolio @xmath42 a numraire if @xmath42 and @xmath43 are traded in this extended sense .",
    "such approaches have been successfully investigated in @xcite in the context of workable claims , or in @xcite via a re - formulation of the ansel - stricker framework @xcite .",
    "we consider here the second approach which seems to us slightly more descriptive , but we could also simply formulate everything in the context of workable claims . notice that the second definition also makes sense under trading constraints .",
    "we give a precise definition which reflects this insight and which _ leads _ to the well known change of numraire formulas , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore we relate this intuitive and economically meaningful definition with the notion of bubbles : a positive portfolio is modeled in a bubble state if it does _ not _ qualify as numraire .",
    "both concepts will play an important role when it comes to the notion of liquidity in bond markets .    consider a filtered probability space @xmath44 } ,",
    "p)$ ] , where the filtration satisfies the usual conditions .",
    "the price process of traded assets @xmath45}=(x^0_t,\\dots , x^d_t)_{t \\in [ 0,t]}$ ] is a @xmath46-dimensional adapted process with cdlg trajectories , where at least one process , say @xmath47 , is positive , i.e.  @xmath48 .",
    "we introduce the process of discounted assets , @xmath49 and assume without loss of generality that we are dealing from now on with a semimartingale @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be a predictable @xmath52-integrable process and denote by @xmath53 the stochastic integral process of @xmath51 with respect to @xmath52 , the _",
    "( portfolio ) wealth process_. the process @xmath54 is called an _ @xmath55-admissible trading strategy _ if there is @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "a strategy is called admissible if it is @xmath55-admissible for some @xmath59 .",
    "define @xmath60 then @xmath61 and @xmath62 form convex cones in @xmath63 .",
    "the condition _ no free lunch with vanishing risk _ ( nflvr ) is the right concept of no arbitrage , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the market @xmath64 satisfies ( nflvr ) if @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the closure of @xmath67 with respect to the norm topology of @xmath68 .",
    "this means that a free lunch with vanishing risk exists , if there exists a free lunch @xmath69 , which can be approximated by a sequence of portfolio wealth processes @xmath70 with @xmath71-admissible integrands",

    "having a general change of numraire theorem in mind it turns out that the concept of admissibility is too strong , since we want to talk about unbounded portfolio wealth processes and their negative to be admissible .",
    "also we want to consider market extensions of the market @xmath64 by assets @xmath77 .",

    "we call assets @xmath78 a market extension of @xmath64 if @xmath79 satisfies ( nflvr ) .",
    "we define in the sequel a larger class of trading strategies which we call @xmath80-admissible .",

    "we also do not introduce free lunches , since this notion _ only _ depends on @xmath55-admissible strategies .",
    "we could use a less general but more appealing definition of @xmath92 when we do not allow for a market extension @xmath84 .",

    "all possible price processes for payoffs at time @xmath32 are added . notice that we should consider @xmath92 as set of trading strategies of our market , but not their union , since the union might contain contradictory pricing structures for one payoff .",
    "now we are in the position to make our intuitive definition of numraire portfolios precise : a numraire portfolio is a strictly positive portfolio which allows for short - selling , i.e.  the negative of its wealth process is still given by a @xmath80-admissible trading strategy for some @xmath81 , and hence is an element of @xmath93 .",
