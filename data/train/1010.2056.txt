    "the millisecond pulsar psr b1257 + 12 with the estimated age of @xmath0 millions years , is located at a distance of 300 parsecs from the earth .",
    "the tiny pulsar is being orbited by three bodies with masses @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 of the earth mass , typical of ordinary planets , and the respective radii of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for that reason , the bodies are considered to be planets .",
    "it was clear from the start , that the planetary system around psr b1257 + 12 was unusual . before wolszczan",
    "s discovery , the existence of planets around neutron stars had not been considered seriously .",
    "if the planets were to be remnants of a planetary system existing around the progenitor star of psr b1257 + 12 , then it would be highly improbable for these planets to have survived the supernova explosion accompanying the neutron star s birth , since then compact bodies acquire velocities high enough to escape from the binding potential of the gravitational well of the surrounding matter .",
    "these planets might also had been formed already after the supernova explosion and the neutron star s formation .",
    "in particular , models of planetary system formation around pulsar accreting matter from its companion have been suggested @xcite . however , this scenario seems also improbable because of strong radiation in the pulsar s vicinity @xcite .",
    "therefore , another hypothesis seems worth considering .",
    "the objects in orbit around psr b1257 + 12 may be just miniature quark stars .",
    "a quark star is a hypothetical object consisting of strange quark matter ( sqm ) .",
    "sqm is a mixture of quasi - free quarks @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and electrons , all of which form relativistic fermi gas .",
    "if sqm is the ground state of strong interactions , then one could expect strange stars to form in space . for sqm to be the ground state",
    ", one needs the minimum of energy per baryon to be not greater than the energy per baryon for the strongest bound nucleus in nature  the nucleus of iron-@xmath11 . hence , @xmath12 at zero pressure , where @xmath13 is the energy density and @xmath14 the baryon density .",
    "the possibility of existence of such objects was put forward first in @xcite .",
    "the easiest way to obtain a phenomenological equation of state for sqm , is to consider the following simplified model @xcite .",
    "suppose that quarks form ultra - relativistic and electrically neutral quantum gas of non - interacting fermions in the @xmath15-equilibrium at temperature @xmath16 $ ] . in this case , the pressure @xmath17 and the total energy density @xmath13 are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the baryon density and @xmath20 is the bag constant , @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "these equations are valid when the fermi energy is much higher than the rest energy of the heaviest quark ( in our numerical calculations we included also the strange quark mass , but the full form of the resulting equations is not important here ) .",
    "the maximal mass and the corresponding size of a quark star are close to those for a neutron star . with the assumed example values",
    "@xmath22 $ ] and the strange quark mass @xmath23 $ ] , sqm would be the ground state for strong interactions .",
    "then , the maximal mass of a quark star made of sqm would be @xmath24 with the corresponding areal radius of about @xmath25 $ ] times greater than its areal radius .",
    "this distinction is usually not made in the literature and by a star s radius is always understood its areal radius . ] , whereas a neutron star with the uv14+tni equation of state @xcite attains @xmath26 at @xmath27 $ ] , see figure [ fig:1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     what could have caused the mini - quark stars to find themselves in the pulsar vicinity ?",
    "the first possibility is detachment of quark matter from the central pulsar during its formation phase , when the `` boiling '' strange matter core could eject some fragments , so that they start to orbit around the strange star .",
    "however , this mechanism does not explain why the orbits of the three planets are nearly circular and almost coplanar ( at least , for two of them ) @xcite .",
    "these features make the planetary disk origin of the pulsar planets very likely . the planetary disk stability and the planet formation present a lot of unknowns and require ad hoc assumptions @xcite .",
    "here we propose another scenario .",
    "the present rotation period of pulsar b1257 + 12 is of about @xmath28 ms and it decelerates with the rate @xmath29 @xcite . the pulsar has the feature of a pulsar spun up in a binary system  it is a millisecond pulsar and , at the same time , it has comparably small deceleration rate and weak magnetic field .",
    "it seems therefore probable the pulsar might have had a companion from which it had been accreting matter . in this case",
    "it is difficult to estimate the age and the initial rotation velocity of a compact object .",
    "however , during the accretion phase , the compact object , by assumption being a quark star , could have spun up to the velocities necessary to detach matter from its surface in the equatorial region .",
    "if only the accretion were sufficient to accelerate the star to the keplerian frequency , which is about 1 khz for strange star @xcite , then several bubbles of quark matter could start to orbit the central star . in a natural way their trajectories",
    "would be circular and coplanar .",
    "being pieces of strange matter they would be completely resistant to the unfriendly pulsar environment heated by pulsar wind or accretion which may evaporate the normal planet .",
    "in this paper we put forward the hypothesis that the planets orbiting the pulsar psr b1257 + 12 may be quark stars made of strange quark matter .",
    "this is alternative to the currently accepted hypothesis that the system is composed of `` ordinary '' planets",
