    "<S> using concept of an @xmath0 phase - conjugating mirror we demonstrate that regardless to internal physical mechanism the phase - conjugation of singular laser beam is accompanied by excitation within mirror of internal waves which carry doubled angular momentum in order to match angular momentum conservation . for brillouin hypersound wavefront - reversal mirror </S>",
    "<S> this means that each elementary optical vortex in a speckle pattern emits acoustical vortex wave with doubled topological charge . </S>",
    "<S> the exact spatial profiles of light intensity and intensity of hypersound in the vicinity of phase singularity are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath1 profiles have a form of a double helix which rotates with the speed of sound . </S>",
    "<S> the optoacoustic experiment is proposed for visualization of wavefront reversal of twisted optical beams and tunable twisted sound generation .    </S>",
    "<S> the conservation of angular momentum @xmath2 @xmath3 stems from isotropy of space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to particles with nonzero rest mass @xmath4 , the decomposition of @xmath5 for `` spin '' @xmath6 and `` orbital '' @xmath7 parts of photon s @xmath8 is referred to as ambiguous procedure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin part @xmath9 is related to polarization , i.e. time - dependent layout of electrical @xmath10 and magnetic @xmath11 fields of the `` transverse '' light wave . the orbital part @xmath12 @xmath13 is associated with helical staircase wavefront @xcite . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> a purely transverse light waves are abstraction because of a small but inevitable projections of @xmath10 and @xmath11 on direction of propagation , say @xmath14-axis(fig.[fig.1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the spin - orbital coupling of light occurs @xcite due to vectorial interplay between longitudinal and transversal components of the fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the vectorial solutions of maxwell s equations for propagation of a light spatially localized by a waveguide or emitted through finite aperture to free space give a strict relationship between longitudinal and transversal field components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the approximate decomposition in the form @xmath17 proved to be very fruitful for small curvatures of light wavefront , i.e. in paraxial wave approximation@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the propagation of light in anisotropic medium changes the polarization and historically the spin of photon was observed firstly in beth s experiment where birefringent @xmath18 plate induced the change of photon polarization from circular ( @xmath19 ) to counter - rotating one ( @xmath20 ) @xcite . the elementary act of photon s spin change accompanied by back action and stepwise increase of angular momentum of a plate . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum - classical correspondence fulfilled by origin of a macroscopically observable classical torque @xmath21 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 - is angular frequency and @xmath24 - is intensity of light .    </S>",
    "<S> the reflection of circularly polarized photon from an ideal conventional mirror ( metal of multilayer dielectric one ) does not change the direction of both spin @xmath9 and orbital momentum @xmath13 in the laboratory frame and mechanical torque @xmath25 on such mirror is absent ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this follows both from boundary conditions for maxwell equations@xcite and from rotational symmetry of setup with respect to @xmath14-axis@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the current communication pays particular attention to conservation laws in reflection of photon carrying @xmath26 @xmath27 from @xmath28-@xmath29 @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discussion will be concentrated mainly upon brillouin wavefront - reversal mirror @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate the hidden anisotropy of sbs - mirror which arise due to excitation of internal helical waves , i.e. acoustical vortices , whose existence had been proven recently for @xmath32-range sound @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation of ultracold cesium atoms @xcite also had been suggested to occur because of @xmath26 transfer due to backward reflection of laguerre - gaussian beam ( @xmath33 ) with @xmath34 diffractive efficiency via nondegenerate four - wave mixing process . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath35 transfer from co - propagating circularly @xmath33 to bec @xcitehad been discussed as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the circularly polarized photon is called `` right '' when projection of the spin @xmath36 upon direction of propagation is positive(fig.[fig.1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this happens for example , when photon moves in positive direction of @xmath37 with momentum @xmath38 and the fields @xmath10 and @xmath39 rotate clockwise with respect to @xmath40 . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> the `` left '' photon have counter - clockwise rotation of polarization and it carries spin @xmath20 .    in reflection from conventional mirror </S>",
    "<S> the incident `` right '' photon with @xmath19 moving in positive direction of @xmath37 with momentum @xmath41 is transformed in a `` left '' photon having @xmath42 and the @xmath43 spin projection @xmath19 . and vice versa , when incident `` left''(or counter - clockwise ) photon strikes mirror , the sign of @xmath20 is not changed in laboratory frame and photon becomes `` right '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising because setup is isotropic . in this situation </S>",
    "<S> the only mechanical effect on mirror is light pressure @xcite , whose major component is normal to mirror surface . </S>",
    "<S> so the conventional mirror in @xmath44 reflection accepts the momentum @xmath45 as a single entity and does not change both polarization ( or spin @xmath9 ) and orbital momentum @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is changed drastically for @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation laws determine the energy of excited acoustical phonon @xmath46 as a difference of energies of incident @xmath47 and reflected @xmath48 photons . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation pressure also takes place here because of net momentum transfer to sound @xmath49 or `` recoil '' . </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting feature is the conservation of @xmath35 @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> let us show that the wavefront - reversal mirror should feel `` rotational recoil '' when vortex beam carrying @xmath26 is reflected with ultimate phase conjugation fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , because of the basic feature of phase - conjugation the retroreflected photon passes all states of the incident one in reverse sequence @xcite.this is a so - called @xmath50 @xmath51 property of the wavefront - reversing mirror . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the helicoidal phase surfaces of incident photon and reflected photon should be perfectly matched ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the small mismatch of the wavefronts caused by recoil frequency shift and wavenumber shift of the order @xmath52 @xcite does not affect the phase surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> because of accurate wavefront s match the @xmath26 is turned to @xmath53 angle and @xmath35 projection @xmath54 is changed to the opposite one @xmath55 . as a consequence the `` winding '' number or topological charge @xmath56 does not change the sign with respect to propagation direction @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the conjugated photon with `` right '' @xmath35 remains `` right '' , the photon with `` left '' @xmath35 remains `` left '' .    the apparent physical consequence of this fact is the necessity of excitation of @xmath57 which ought to absorb the difference of angular momenta @xmath58 before and after retroreflection . </S>",
    "<S> consequently this internal wave should have singular wavefront unavoidably provided the @xmath31 is ideal . </S>",
    "<S> at this point let us stress again upon remarkable difference between @xmath59 @xmath9 and @xmath60 @xmath13 components of angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostrictive nonlinearity in isotropic medium is scalar in paraxial approximation at least and spin part of @xmath8 is not turned to opposite one@xcite . on the contrary , the orbital component @xmath13 or @xmath26 does turns , because acoustical vortices do exist@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown below in details by @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 how acoustical vortices absorb the @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact there exist some obstacles in realization of the perfect phase - conjugation of elementary optical vortices say in the form of @xmath33 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless it will be shown below how to overcome this class of difficulties using traditional and reliable methods of the brillouin phase - conjugation@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose let us separate the region of wavefront reversal via traditional phase - conjugating mechanisms , e.g. brillouin @xmath31 and optoacoustic cell ( @xmath64 ) where sound is excited parametrically , without back action on light(fig.[fig.2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry makes possible to visualize inside @xmath64 acoustical vortex collocated with the optical phase singularity in a spatial region having size up to several millimeters in transverse dimensions , i.e. in @xmath65-plane@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the acoustical waves inside brillouin @xmath31 volume are highly dissipative , because hypersound have a typical relaxation times about @xmath66@xcite . in liquid crystals , which are used for phase - conjugation </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation times are significantly longer - @xmath67@xcite . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> one might expect to observe the macroscopic torque on @xmath68 for appropriate time scales . or else in anisotropic artificial medium alike veselago s lens @xcite might appear a macroscopic rotational recoil caused by optical torque .    </S>",
    "<S> consider for definiteness the interaction of the two counter - propagating paraxial laser beams inside brillouin active medium . instead of the quantized field description by means of heisenberg s secondary - quantization @xmath69 - operators @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we choose more intuitive approach using classical counter - propagating optical fields @xmath70 , @xmath71 and acoustic field @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the linearly polarized `` pump '' field @xmath70 moves in positive direction of @xmath37 , the reflected stockes field @xmath71 with the same polarization propagates in opposite direction(fig.[fig.3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the acoustic field @xmath72 is excited via electrostriction . </S>",
    "<S> the cylindrical system of coordinates @xmath73 is choosed for equations below . </S>",
    "<S> the connection with cartesian coordinates used in figures is supposed to be evident . </S>",
    "<S> the `` parabolic '' equations of motion are well known@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the `` envelope '' complex amplitude of pump wave @xmath74 moving from left to right ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) follows to :    @xmath75    the stockes wave `` envelope '' @xmath76 moving from right to left is controlled by : @xmath77    the acoustic wave `` envelope '' @xmath78 moving from left to right obeys to : @xmath79    where @xmath80 - is the electrostrictive coupling constant , @xmath81 - is the density of medium , @xmath82 - is the index of refraction , @xmath83 - is the speed of light , @xmath84 - is a speed of sound@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the solution of ( [ pumpwave]-[acouswave ] ) for @xmath64 could be obtained under natural physical assumption that amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath71 are small enough and acoustic field @xmath72 is excited parametrically , by electrostrictive force in a right - hand side of ( [ acouswave ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption enables us to solve ( [ pumpwave]-[stockeswave ] ) in free - space approximation , i.e. without right - hand sides . for cauchi propagation problem with first order laguerre - gaussian beam as initial condition for @xmath70 ( from left window of @xmath64 ) and @xmath71 ( from right window of @xmath64 ) we have the following @xmath61 solutions for pump field @xmath88 :    @xmath89 { </S>",

    "<S> the resulting doppler shift @xmath118 is such that optical interference pattern perfectly overlaps with spatial profile of acoustic field . the left picture of ( fig . </S>",
