    "perturbation theory , i.e. the expansion in powers of @xmath3 , has been applied to describe decays of the beauty quark since its discovery .",
    "while the expansion parameter @xmath4 , being reasonably small , allows one to have confidence in the computations , it is difficult to directly compare the perturbative approach with the experimental data .",
    "as is well known , decay rates do not make good quantities to be compared with the data , because they are proportional to the fifth power of the beauty quark mass , a poorly known parameter , @xmath5 and because they involve in principle unknown ckm matrix elements such as @xmath6 etc .. by taking ratios of different widths , one can cancel the @xmath7 dependence in the observables , and , eventually , also the dependence on the ckm matrix elements .",
    "a rather good theoretical quantity is represented , for instance , by the semileptonic branching ratio : @xmath8 which turns out to be marginally in agreement with present data @xcite .",
    "inclusive quantities , @xmath9 , such as ( [ slbf ] ) , have a perturbative series that involves numerical coefficients @xmath10 of the form : @xmath11 in less inclusive quantities , additional dynamical effects appear , due to the kinematical restrictions on the final particles , and the use of perturbation theory is , in general , less justified . in semi - inclusive quantities ,",

    "resummation of such enhanced terms to any order in @xmath3 can be performed in various approximations .",
    "+ the simplest one , the leading logarithmic approximation , involves picking up only the terms having two powers of the logarithm for each power of the coupling , i.e. @xmath16 . in the double - logarithmic approximation each parton",
    "is dressed with a cloud of soft and collinear gluons .",
    "further , more refined approximations involve smaller numbers of logarithms for each power of @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath17 . + in the last years",
    ", considerable effort has been devoted to the study of various spectra in @xmath18 decays in the endpoint region , in the framework of resummed perturbation theory . + in order to verify the ability of the resummed perturbation theory to describe @xmath18 decays in a different dynamical situation , we considered , in a previous note @xcite , @xmath13-distributions describing that of the @xmath19 quark with respect to the photon direction , in the @xmath20 rest frame .",
    "+ in this work , @xcite , the following issues have been considered : the resummed @xmath13-distribution in the @xmath21 decay is evaluated and both perturbative and non - perturbative sources of transverse momentum contributions discussed .",
    "the general theoretical framework for the evaluation of the corresponding matrix element defined and the strategy to evaluate leading and next - to - leading perturbative contributions is outlined , by introducing a method to treat the radiative corrections and their summation in a improved perturbative formula .",
    "the comparison of the transverse momentum distribution singularity structure with the more widely - known threshold case is also presented .",
    "+ the chosen quantity manifests a clear advantage from a phenomenological point of view since , as discussed in @xcite , it depends only on the photon momentum in the process .",
    "thanks to the straightforward and direct kinematics , the transverse momentum turns out to be a particularly simple variable to use to discuss the singularity structure of the perturbative expansion . the case of a possible effective theory within which to factorize these singularities",

    "+ here the general perturbative expression for the whole distribution will be concisely recalled and the new entries represented by the coefficient function @xmath24 and by the remainder function @xmath25 will be evaluated . both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are process - dependent and require an explicit evaluation of feynman diagrams .",
    "+ resummation of large infrared logarithms in @xmath20 decays have been studied in great detail in recent years .",
    "this scheme is justified by the fact that the double logarithm appearing to order @xmath3 can become rather large ( with respect to 1 coming from the tree level ) : @xmath26 if we push the transverse momentum to such small values as @xmath27 mev .",
    "the single logarithm can also become rather large , having a large numerical coefficient : @xmath28 the purpose of resumming classes of such terms therefore seems quite justified .",
    "if we consider running coupling effects , i.e. if the ( frozen ) coupling evaluated at the hard scale @xmath29 gev is replaced by the coupling evaluated at the gluon transverse momentum , @xmath30 the logarithmic terms have sizes of order : @xmath31 and @xmath32 the main difference with respect to resummation in @xmath33 decays is a hard scale smaller by over an order of magnitude , i.e. a coupling larger by a factor 2 and infrared logarithms smaller by a factor 3 .",
    "the decay @xmath35 is loop - mediated in the standard model and offers stringent tests of the latter as well as a way to extract ckm matrix elements .",
