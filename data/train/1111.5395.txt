    "the gauss - bonnet - chern theorem @xmath5 for a compact @xmath6-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath7 generalizes the gauss - bonnet theorem for compact @xmath8-dimensional surfaces .",
    "it averages the euler curvature form @xmath9 , the pfaffian @xmath10 of the curvature form @xmath11 over the manifold , and leads to the euler characteristic @xmath12 .",
    "first tackled by allendoerfer and fenchel for surfaces in euclidean space and extended by allendoerfer and weil to closed riemannian manifolds , it was chern , whose 100th birthday we celebrate this year , who first gave an intrinsic proof @xcite .",
    "modern proofs use fermionic calculus @xcite which becomes especially elegant in patodi s approach @xcite .",
    "+ we introduce here an euler curvature form @xmath13 for graphs which only depends on the number @xmath14 of @xmath15-dimensional pieces of the unit sphere @xmath16 at @xmath17 with @xmath18 . since by definition , we have a @xmath6-dimensional graph @xmath19 , the unit sphere @xmath16 at a point is a @xmath20-dimensional graph .",
    "while puiseux type formulas allow to discretize curvature in two dimensions , the lack of a natural second order difference calculus for graphs prevents a straightforward translation of the classical euler curvature form to graph theory so that we construct it from scratch using some assumptions on graphs so that everything stays elementary . for four dimensional graphs for example ,",
    "the curvature form @xmath13 at @xmath17 depends only on the number of edges and faces of the three dimensional sphere @xmath16 centered at @xmath17 .",
    "+ for two - dimensional graphs , the euler curvature form is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the arc length of the unit circle @xmath16 .",
    "this curvature traces back to a combinatorial curvature defined in @xcite , where differential geometry is pushed to more general spaces .",
    "gromov s graph theoretical curvature is up to a normalization defined by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are the cardinalities of the neighboring face degrees for vertices @xmath25 in the sphere @xmath16 . for two dimensional graphs , where necessarily all faces are triangles , this simplifies to @xmath26 so that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cardinality of the sphere @xmath16 of radius 1 .",
    "if @xmath29 is a cyclic graph , then the arc length and vertex cardinality of the sphere are the same .",
    "the combinatorial curvature illustrates the @xmath30-condition @xmath31 for non - positive curvature and that @xmath32 leads to strictly negative curvature . for two - dimensional graph with or without boundary",
    ", the result appears in @xcite , where @xmath33 was scaled to avoid fractions .",
    "we do not rescale the discrete euler form in this article because with increasing dimensions , the denominator terms become larger and would have to be scaled in a dimension - dependent manner to be rendered integer valued .",
    "we could work with @xmath34 which is an integer but leave the fractions .",
    "for two dimensional graphs , the sphere @xmath16 of a vertex @xmath17 is one - dimensional graph without boundary , a cyclic graph . in three dimensions",
    ", the euler curvature form @xmath4 vanishes identically . for four - dimensional graphs , which is already a new case , the curvature form is @xmath35 , where @xmath3 is the number of edges of the unit sphere @xmath16 and where @xmath36 is the number of faces in @xmath16 . for 5 dimensional graphs ,",
    "the curvature form is @xmath37",
    ". it would be zero if @xmath38 .",
    "we do not know yet whether it is always identically zero , even so the sum over the entire graph is .",
    "also the examples of 5-dimensional graphs we looked at , @xmath39 .",
    "+    the core mechanism for relating global euler characteristic and local curvature for general finite undirected graphs @xmath1 is the following : the total number @xmath40 of @xmath15 dimensional simplices in @xmath19 is related to the number @xmath41 of @xmath42 dimensional simplices in the unit sphere @xmath43 by @xmath44 . then @xmath45 with curvature @xmath46 where we use that @xmath47 .",
    "we have just seen a very general gauss - bonnet theorem relating a local curvature form with a global quantity : +    here are some examples . for a discrete graph @xmath48 with @xmath49 vertices without edges , the unit spheres are all empty and @xmath50 sums up to @xmath51 . for the complete graph @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 and since @xmath43 is @xmath54 we have @xmath55 adding up to @xmath56 . for a tree ,",
    "the curvature of a vertex @xmath17 is @xmath57 .",
    "the sum of the curvatures of a single tree is @xmath56 and the total curvature of a forest the number of trees . for a wheel graph @xmath58 with @xmath59 vertices and @xmath60 edges and @xmath49 faces",
    ", we have @xmath61 .",
    "the central vertex @xmath17 has @xmath62 , the other @xmath49 points @xmath63 have @xmath64 .",
    "the total curvature is @xmath56 . for an octahedron @xmath19",
    ", we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 and since each unit sphere is the circular graph @xmath67 so that @xmath68 the total curvature is @xmath69 . for a cube @xmath19 with @xmath70",
    "we get @xmath71 reflecting the fact that we have @xmath72 holes .",
    "because @xmath43 consists of @xmath73 discrete points , we have @xmath74 everywhere and the sum is @xmath75 . if we stellate the cube , it becomes @xmath8 dimensional and the data @xmath76 lead to @xmath77 .",
    "the original vertices have zero curvature @xmath78 , the six new ones satisfy @xmath79 and the total curvature is @xmath8 .",
    "+ as we have just seen , gauss - bonnet - chern is elementary and works for general graphs . despite that it can be stated and proven quickly , the topic is far from trivial .",
    "we explore it here in a setting close to differential geometry , where all unit spheres have properties known to spheres in @xmath80 . while the topic is accessible to high school mathematics , there are many open questions . for example",
    ", we do not yet have cases of 5 dimensional graphs , where the euler curvature form is not identically zero which makes us believe that it is always zero in odd dimensions .",
    "concrete examples can become tedious to compute by hand in higher dimensions and computers are essential for exploration .",
    "a triangularization of the @xmath81 dimensional cube for example which can be realized as a convex polytope in @xmath82 leads to a graph with 536 vertices and 8216 edges which has five different types of @xmath83 dimensional unit spheres .",
    "still , the curvature form @xmath84 for @xmath85 is identically zero at every point .",
    "also combinatorial problems appear .",
    "discrete versions of bonnet - schoenberg - myers bounds show that there are only finitely many @xmath86 dimensional graphs where all sectional curvatures are strictly positive meaning that every two dimensional subgraph has strictly positive curvature .",
    "up to isomorphisms , there are six for @xmath87 .",
    "how many are there in @xmath88 ? also ricci curvature @xmath89 , a function on the edge set @xmath3 which gives the sum over all curvatures of @xmath8 dimensional wheel graphs containing a given edge @xmath90 is unexplored .",
    "any question in differential topology can be considered for @xmath6-dimensional graphs .",
    "for example , chern proved that for four dimensional manifolds with nonpositive sectional curvatures , the euler curvature form is nonnegative .",
    "is it true that for a @xmath83 dimensional graph the curvature form @xmath35 is nonnegative if every two dimensional wheel subgraph of @xmath19 has @xmath72 or more spikes ?",
    "throughout the paper we work in a graph theoretical setup .",
    "we especially do not assume anywhere that graphs are embedded in any ambient euclidean space , nor assume the graph to be a triangularization of a smooth manifold .",
    "all graphs are finite undirected graphs without self loops and without multiple edges .",
    "any conceptual discretization of differential geometry to graph theory requires to give a graph theoretical definition of what dimension means for a graph .",
    "we work with the inductive graph dimension given in @xcite but make an additional assumption about the topology of the unit sphere .",
    "the later is essential to be close to geometry .",
    "it even narrows the class of @xmath6 dimensional graphs because as we will see , there are @xmath6-dimensional graphs in which unit spheres can have any prescribed euler characteristic possible in the continuum .",
    "+ let @xmath40 denote the number of @xmath15-dimensional subgraphs of a graph @xmath1 which are simplices , complete graphs @xmath91 with @xmath92 vertices .",
    "the euler characteristic of a @xmath6-dimensional graph @xmath19 is defined as @xmath93 for @xmath87 dimensions for example , we have @xmath94 , @xmath95 , the number of vertices , edges and faces and @xmath96 .    a graph @xmath1 with @xmath97 vertices and @xmath98 edges",
    "is called a @xmath6-dimensional graph without boundary if at every vertex @xmath17 , the unit sphere @xmath99 is a connected @xmath20-dimensional graph without boundary of euler characteristic @xmath100 .",
    "this is an inductive definition which also should apply to unit spheres .",
    "we additionally make the assumption that @xmath101 .",
    "together with the assumption that a graph without any edges is zero - dimensional , this defines dimension inductively .    by adding @xmath56 to the average of the dimensions of all spheres",
    ", we can define inductively dimension for all graphs , but the dimension becomes fractional in general . figure  ( [ example ] ) for example displays a fantasy graph of dimension @xmath102 .",
    "define the fractions @xmath103 , and the integers @xmath104 .",
    "the later is @xmath56 for even @xmath6 and @xmath105 for odd @xmath6 . here are the first entries : +       its euler characteristic is @xmath106 as for any @xmath72-dimensional spherical graph .",
    "we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "there are 14 vertices and the total curvature is @xmath8 and agrees with the euler characteristic . +",
