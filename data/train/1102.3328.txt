    "as video surveillance equipments and mobile devices such as digital cameras , smart phones and netbooks are increasingly widely deployed , cameras are expected to acquire , record and sometimes compress and transmit video content in all lighting and weather conditions .",
    "the majority of cameras , however , are not specifically designed to be all - purpose and weather - proof , rendering the video footage unusable for critical applications under many circumstances .",
    "image and video processing and enhancement including gamma correction , de - hazing , de - bluring and etc .",
    "are well - studied areas with many successful algorithms proposed over the years . although different algorithms perform well for different lighting impairments , they often require tedious and sometimes manual input - dependent fine - tuning of algorithm parameters .",
    "in addition , different specific types of impairments often require different specific algorithms .",
    "take the enhancement of videos acquired under low lighting conditions as an example . to mitigate the problem , far and near infrared based techniques ( @xcite )",
    "are used in many systems , and at the same time , various image processing based approaches have also been proposed .",
    "although far and near infrared systems are useful for detecting objects such as pedestrians and animals in low lighting environments , especially in `` professional '' video surveillance systems , they suffer from the common disadvantage that detectable objects must have a temperature that is higher than their surroundings .",
    "in many cases where the critical object has a temperature similar to its surroundings , e.g. a big hole in the road , the infrared systems are not as helpful .",
    "furthermore , infrared systems are usually more expensive , harder to maintain , with a relatively shorter life - span than conventional systems .",
    "they also introduce extra , and often times considerable power consumption .",
    "in many consumer applications such as video capture and communications on smart phones , it is usually not feasible to deploy infrared systems due to such cost and power consumption issues .",
    "conventional low lighting image and video processing enhancement algorithms such as @xcite and @xcite often work by reducing noise in the input low lighting video followed by contrast enhancement techniques such as tone - mapping , histogram stretching and equalization , and gamma correction to recover visual information in low lighting images and videos .",
    "although these algorithms can lead to very visually pleasing enhancement results , they are usually too complicated for practical real - time applications , especially on mobile devices . for example , the processing speed of the algorithm in @xcite was only 6 fps even with gpu acceleration . in @xcite , recovering each single image required more than one minute .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a novel integrated video enhancement algorithm applicable to a wide range of input impairments .",
    "it has low computational and memory complexities that are both within the realm of reasonable availability of many mobile devices . in our system ,",
    "a low complexity automatic module first determines the pre - dominate source of impairment in the input video .",
    "the input is then pre - processed based on the particular source of impairment , followed by processing by the core enhancement module .",
    "finally , post - processing is applied to produce the enhanced output .",
    "in addition , spatial and temporal correlations were utilized to improve the speed of the algorithm and visual quality of the output , enabling it to be embedded into video encoders or decoders to share temporal and spatial prediction modules in the video codec to further lower complexity .",
    "the paper is organized as the following . in section [ sec : algo ] , we present the heuristic evidences that motivated the idea in this paper . in section [ sec : enh ] , we explain the core enhancement algorithm in detail , while in section [ sec : opt ] we describe various algorithms for reducing the computational and memory complexities .",
    "sections [ sec : results ] contains the experimental results .",
    "given that in real - world applications , the video enhancement module could be deployed in multiple stages of the end to end procedure , e.g. before compression and transmission / storage , or after compression and transmission / storage but before decompression , or after decompression and before the video content displayed on the monitor , we examine the complexity and rd tradeoff associated with applying the proposed algorithm in these different steps in the experiments .",
    "finally we conclude the paper and future works in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the motivation for our algorithm is a key observation that if we perform a pixel - wise inversion of low lighting videos or high dynamic range videos , the results look quite similar to hazy videos . as an illustrative example",
    ", we randomly selected ( by google ) and captured a total of 100 images and video clips in haze , low lighting and high dynamic range weather conditions respectively .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : day_night ] . here , the `` inversion '' operation is simply @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are intensities for the corresponding color ( rgb ) channel @xmath3 for pixel @xmath4 in the input and inverted frame respectively .    as can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : day_night ] , at least visually , the video in hazy weather are similar to the inverted output of videos captured in low lighting and high dynamic range conditions .",
    "this is intuitive because as illustrated in @xcite , in all these cases , e.g. hazy videos and low lighting videos , light captured by the camera is blended with the airlight ( ambient light reflected into the line of sight by atmospheric particles ) .",
    "the only difference is the actual brightness of the airlight , white in the case of haze videos , black in the case of low lighting and high dynamic range videos .",
    "the observation is confirmed by various haze detection algorithms .",
    "we implemented haze detection using the hvs threshold range based method @xcite , the dark object subtraction ( dos ) approach @xcite , and the spatial frequency based technique @xcite , and found that hazy , inverted low lighting videos and inverted high dynamic range videos were all classified as hazy video clips , as opposed to `` normal '' clips .",
    "+   +   +    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : result_speed ]    we also measured the computational complexity of frame - wise enhancement , acceleration with a separate me module and integration into an encoder or a decoder . the computational cost was measured in terms of average time spent on enhancement per frame . for the cases",
    "when the enhancement was integrated into the codec , we did not count the actual encoding or decoding time , so as to measure only the enhancement itself .",
    "as shown in the table [ table : result_speed ] , using a separate me module saved about 27.5% time on average compared with the frame - wise algorithm .",
    "on the other hand , integrating with the decoder saved 40% time compared with the frame wise algorithm , while integrating with the encoder saved about 77.3% .",
    "in the paper , we propose a novel fast and efficient integrated algorithm for real - time enhancement of videos acquired under challenging lighting conditions including low lighting , bad weather ( hazy , rainy , snowy ) and high dynamic range conditions .",
    "we show that visually and statistically , hazy video and video captured in various challenging lighting conditions are very similar , and therefore a single core enhancement algorithm can be utilized in all cases , along with a proper pre - processing and an automatic impairment source detection module .",
    "we also describe a number of ways of reducing the computational complexity of the system while maintaining good visual quality , and the tradeoffs involved when the proposed system is integrated into different modules of the video acquisition , coding , transmission and consumption chain .",
    "areas of further improvements include better pre - processing filters targeting specific sources of impairments , improved core enhancement algorithm , and better acceleration techniques . also of great importance",
    "is a system that can process inputs with compounded impairments ( e.g. video of foggy nights , with both haze and low lighting ) .",
