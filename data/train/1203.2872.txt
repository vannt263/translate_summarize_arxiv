    "the penrose inequality is a conjecture on spacetimes containing specific types of spacelike codimension - two surfaces which play the role of quasi - local replacements of black holes .",
    "in addition , the spacetime is assumed to satisfy an energy condition and have suitable asymptotic behaviour at infinity .",
    "the inequality bounds from below the total mass of the spacetime in terms of the area of the quasi - local black holes ( or suitable surfaces defined in terms of them ) .",
    "the penrose inequality is important because it provides a strengthening of the positive mass theorem and also , and perhaps more importantly , because its validity would give rather strong indirect support for the validity of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite .",
    "in fact , the penrose inequality was originally put forward by penrose @xcite as a way of identifying gravitational configurations that could violate the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis . since then , and given the absence of counterexamples , the emphasis has turned into trying to prove the conjecture .",
    "so far , the inequality has been proved in full generality in the case of asymptotically flat spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and containing a time - symmetric asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface with an inner boundary composed of outermost closed minimal surfaces .",
    "the case of spacetime dimension four and connected inner boundary was dealt with by huisken and ilmanen @xcite .",
    "the case of spacetime dimension up to eight and no assumption on connectedness of the inner boundary is due to bray @xcite .",
    "the other general case where the inequality is known to hold is for spherically symmetric spacetimes satisfying the dominant energy condition ( in arbitrary spacetime dimension ) @xcite . besides this , there are also many partial results of interest ( see @xcite for a relatively recent review on this topic and @xcite for some new developments ) .    one version of the penrose inequality deals with asymptotically flat spacetimes with a regular past null infinity @xmath3 and satisfying the dominant energy condition . consider a closed , orientable spacelike @xmath0 surface and recall that @xmath0 admits two future directed null normals @xmath4 , @xmath5 . if @xmath0 is such that the null expansion along @xmath4 vanishes ( i.e. it is a marginally outer trapped surface ) and , moreover , the null hypersurface @xmath6 defined by null geodesics starting on @xmath0 and tangent to @xmath7 extends smoothly all the way to @xmath3 , then the penrose inequality conjectures that the bondi mass evaluated at the cut between @xmath6 and @xmath3 is bounded below in terms of the area of @xmath0 . in four dimensions",
    ", the inequality reads @xmath8 ludvigsen and vickers @xcite proposed an argument to prove this inequality in the general case .",
    "however , this argument made use of an implicit assumption that does not hold in general @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not easy to write down conditions directly on @xmath0 which ensures that this extra assumption holds true .",
    "the penrose inequality for the bondi mass is therefore an open and interesting problem .",
    "a particularly simple case of this version of the inequality can be formulated for spacetimes generated by shells of null dust propagating in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "in fact this situation was the original set up where the penrose inequality was discussed in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "the idea is the following : imagine that a infinitesimally thin shell of matter is sent from past null infinity in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the matter content of the shell is null dust , i.e. pressure - less matter propagating at the speed of light .",
    "assume that the shape of the shell , as seen by an inertial observer in the minkowski spacetime , is a convex surface sufficiently near @xmath3 .",
    "this guarantees that the null hypersurface defined by the motion of the null dust is regular in a neighbourhood of @xmath3 .",
    "of course this null hypersurface will develop singularities in the future , where incoming null geodesics meet conjugate points .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the maximal extension of this null hypersurface as a smooth submanifold in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the shell modifies the spacetime geometry after it has passed and , since it is collapsing , it will typically generate a trapped surface in its exterior . the spacetime outside the shell is , in general , very complicated ( in particular , because the shell produces gravitational waves ) , but the interior geometry remains unaffected before the shell goes through .",
    "now , the spacetime geometry right after the shell passes can be determined from the interior geometry and the properties of the shell itself by using the junction conditions between spacetimes , see e.g. @xcite . moreover",
    ", the matter distribution of the shell can be prescribed freely ( at one instant of time ) .",
    "it turns out that given _ any _ closed ( i.e. compact and without boundary ) , spacelike surface embedded in @xmath6 , the energy distribution of the null shell can be arranged so that @xmath0 is a marginally outer trapped surface with respect to the spacetime geometry generated by the shell .",
    "the direction @xmath4 along which the null expansion vanishes is transverse to @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the energy density of the shell determines the bondi mass of the newly generated spacetime at the cut defined by the intersection of @xmath6 and @xmath3 .",
    "now , the area of @xmath0 is the same when measured with the minkowskian geometry and when observed from the outside spacetime geometry .",
    "moreover , the jump of the null expansion @xmath9 across the shell can be computed in terms of the energy - density of the shell . combining this facts",
    ", it follows that the penrose inequality ( [ pibondi ] ) becomes an inequality for ( a suitable class of ) closed spacelike surfaces in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the resulting inequality is ( see @xcite in four spacetime dimensions and @xcite for arbitrary dimension ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dimension of @xmath0 ( i.e. two in spacetime dimension four ) and @xmath12 the area of the standard sphere @xmath2 . in this expression @xmath13",
    "is the area of the surface @xmath0 and @xmath14 is the null expansion of @xmath0 with respect to the future directed , outer ( i.e. transverse to @xmath6 ) null normal @xmath4 normalized by the condition @xmath15 , where @xmath5 is the future directed null normal to @xmath0 which is tangent to @xmath6 and which satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "all these expressions refer to the geometry of the minkowski spacetime , in particular @xmath17 denotes scalar product with the minkowskian metric and @xmath18 is a covariantly constant , unit , timelike vector field in the minkowski spacetime . the only restriction on the surfaces",
    "@xmath0 is that the null hypersurface obtained by sending light orthogonally from them along @xmath7 generates a hypersurface which is regular everywhere and extends all the way to infinity .",
    "geometrically , it is clear that this occurs if and only if the intersection of @xmath6 with the constant hyperplane @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 sufficiently negative ) is a convex surface of the euclidean space .",
    "we call these surfaces @xmath0 _ spacetime convex _ in this paper .    despite the simplicity of the ambient geometry ,",
    "proving this inequality is still remarkably difficult .",
    "the first case that was solved involved surfaces @xmath0 that lie on a constant time hyperplane @xmath19 . in this case",
    ", gibbons proved @xcite that the inequality reduces to the classic minkowski inequality relating the total mean curvature and the area of convex surfaces in euclidean space ( see expression ( 4 ) in sect .",
    "56 of @xcite ) .",
    "the second case refers to surfaces @xmath0 contained in the past null cone of a point and leads to a non - trivial inequality for functions on the sphere @xcite . in spacetime dimension four , its validity was proved by tod @xcite using the sobolev inequality in @xmath21 applied to functions with suitable angular dependence . regarding the general case , gibbons claimed @xcite to have a general proof .",
    "however , the argument contains a serious gap and the problem remains open .",
    "this gap was first mentioned in @xcite without going into the details . in section [ gibbonssect ] we discuss in more detail the argument used by gibbons and show where it fails .",
    "our main objective in this paper is to express the penrose inequality in the minkowski spacetime of arbitrary dimension in terms of the geometry of the convex euclidean surface obtained by intersecting @xmath6 with a constant time hyperplane @xmath22 together with the time height function @xmath23 .",
    "this is the contents of theorem [ t0 ] . by applying a powerful sobolev type inequality on the sphere due to beckner @xcite",
    "we prove the validity of this inequality in the case when the surface @xmath0 lies in the past null cone of a point ( theorem [ tspherical ] ) .",
    "this generalizes to arbitrary dimension the result by tod @xcite in spacetime dimension four mentioned above and shows that a conjecture put forward by this author regarding the optimal form of the inequality is in fact true .",
    "the geometry of convex , compact hypersurfaces in euclidean space can be fully described in terms of a single function @xmath24 on the unit sphere .",
    "this function is called the `` support function '' and plays an important role in this paper . in spacetime dimension four , the support function was already used in @xcite in a related but different context .",
    "one of our main results is theorem [ t1 ] where we write down the penrose inequality in minkowski as an inequality involving two smooth functions on the @xmath11-dimensional sphere .",
    "inspired by the argument by ludvigsen and vickers @xcite and simplified later by bergqvist @xcite , we are able to prove ( theorem [ tsolution ] ) the validity of this inequality in four spacetime dimensions for a large class of surfaces .",
    "this class contains a non - empty open set of surfaces .",
    "however , when applied to surfaces lying on the past null cone of a point , the only case covered by this theorem is when @xmath0 is a round sphere .",
    "thus , the cases covered by theorem [ tspherical ] and by theorem [ tsolution ] are essentially complementary , which indicates that any attempt of proving the penrose inequality in minkowski in the general case will probably require a combination of both methods .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss gibbons argument @xcite and explain in detail where it fails . for the sake of clarity , we use in this section the same notation and conventions of @xcite . in section",
    "@xmath25 we introduce the notation and conventions we use in this paper .",
    "we also recall some well - known facts on the geometry of null hypersurfaces used later . in section",
    "@xmath26 we relate the two null expansions of a spacelike surface embedded in a strictly static spacetime .",
    "although applied in this paper only in the case of the minkowski spacetime this result is interesting on its own and has potential application for the penrose inequality for null dust shells propagating in background spacetimes more general than minkowski . in section",
    "@xmath27 we introduce the notions of _ spacetime convex null hypersurface _ and _ spacetime convex surface _ which are useful for stating and studying the penrose inequality in minkowski and we rewrite this inequality in terms of the geometry of the projected surface obtained by intersecting the outer directed past null cone @xmath6 of @xmath0 with a constant time hyperplane @xmath28 , and the so - called `` height function '' @xmath29 which identifies @xmath0 within @xmath6 . in section",
    "@xmath30 we introduce the support function @xmath24 for convex hypersurfaces in euclidean space and rewrite the inequality in terms of the functions @xmath31 ( and its derivatives ) , as functions of the unit sphere @xmath2 .",
    "we show that , in the particular case when @xmath6 is the past null cone of a point , the penrose inequality follows from beckner s inequality @xcite . in section @xmath32 , we restrict ourselves to the four dimensional case and , exploit properties of two - dimensional endomorphisms in order to simplify the inequality in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "the result is stated in theorem [ t2 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec1 ] we prove the validity of the inequality for a large class of surfaces in the four - dimensional case .",
    "the method of proof is inspired in the flow of surfaces put forward by ludvigsen and vickers @xcite and simplified and clarified later by bergqvist @xcite .",
    "the explicit form we have for the inequality allows us make the method work for a much larger class of surfaces than those covered by the original argument . in future work",
    "we intend to study whether this extension can be pushed from the minkowski spacetime discussed here to more general spacetimes with a complete past null infinity .",
    "in this section we discuss the gap in gibbons attempt @xcite to prove the general inequality ( [ b2 ] ) . following the notation in @xcite",
    ", we will denote by @xmath33 the spacelike , spacetime convex surface involved in the inequality .",
    "the future directed null normals are called @xmath34 and @xmath35 and are chosen so that @xmath34 is inward ( i.e. the geodesics tangent to @xmath34 generate the null hypersurface @xmath6 extending to @xmath3 ) and satisfy @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a covariantly constant , unit , timelike vector field in minkowski and indices are raised and lowered with the minkowski metric @xmath39 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath40 the covariant derivative in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the strategy in @xcite was to project @xmath33 along @xmath38 onto a constant time hyperplane orthogonal to @xmath38 .",
    "the projected surface is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "the main idea was to rewrite ( [ b2 ] ) in terms of the geometry of @xmath41 as a hypersurface in euclidean space .",
    "gibbons finds that , whenever @xmath42 , the projected surface @xmath41 has non - negative mean curvature and its mean curvature ( with respect to the outer unit normal tangent to the constant time hyperplane ) @xmath43 , reads ( see expression ( 5.11 ) in @xcite ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the null expansion of @xmath35 ( hence @xmath47 when compared with the normalization we used in ( [ b2 ] ) ) and @xmath48 is minus the null expansion along @xmath34 . as a consequence of ( [ hatj ] ) and properties of the minkowski spacetime it follows @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 are , respectively , the area elements of @xmath33 and @xmath41 .",
    "the area of @xmath41 is not smaller that the area of @xmath33 and hence inequality ( [ b2 ] ) would follow from ( [ gibbons ] ) and the minkowski - type inequality @xmath52 in 1994 , trudinger @xcite considered this inequality for general mean convex surfaces in euclidean space ( i.e. surfaces with non - negative mean curvature ) and gave an argument for its proof using an elliptic method .",
    "however , according to guan and li @xcite , this argument turns out to be incomplete and the inequality is still open ( in @xcite a parabolic argument is proposed which proves the inequality for mean convex _ starshaped domains _ in euclidean space ) .",
    "nevertheless , the main problem with gibbons argument does not lie in the validity of ( [ meanconvex ] ) but on the orthogonal projection leading to ( [ hatj ] ) .",
    "the projection is performed as follows .",
    "first extend @xmath34 to an ingoing null hypersurface @xmath53 by solving the affinely parametrized null geodesic @xmath54 with initial data @xmath34 on @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , @xmath35 is extended to a null vector field on the outgoing null hypersurface @xmath55 passing through @xmath0 and with tangent vector @xmath35 .",
    "these vector fields are then extended to a spacetime neighbourhood of @xmath0 by parallel transport along @xmath38 . with this extension",
    ", we have @xmath36 everywhere . defining @xmath56 on this neighbourhood by @xmath57",
    ", the following vector field can be introduced : @xmath58 it follows immediately that @xmath59 is everywhere normal to @xmath38 .",
    "morever , this field is orthogonal to @xmath41 and unit on this projected surface .",
    "gibbons used in @xmath60 that the mean curvature @xmath43 of the projected surface @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath61 .",
    "however , the definition of mean curvature gives @xmath62 .",
    "the extension of @xmath59 is uniquely fixed by the definition ( [ nu ] ) and a priori there is no reason why this vector should remain unit in a neighbourhood of @xmath41 ( or , more precisely , that the derivative of its norm should vanish on @xmath41 ) . moreover , substituting ( [ nu ] ) in the ( correct ) expression for @xmath43 gives @xmath63 which agrees with ( [ hatj ] ) only if the last three terms cancel each other .",
    "the third term in the right - hand side of ( [ meancurv ] ) is always zero because @xmath64 , which follows from the fact that @xmath35 is geodesic and @xmath38 is covariantly constant .",
    "however , neither @xmath65 nor the derivative of @xmath56 along @xmath34 need to vanish on @xmath41 . even more , they need not , and in fact do not , cancel out in general . this fact invalidates ( [ hatj ] ) which in turn , spoils the relationship ( [ gibbons ] ) between the left - hand side of the penrose inequality ( [ b2 ] ) and the integral of the mean curvature @xmath43 of the projected surface @xmath66 .",
    "it is possible to derive general expressions both for @xmath67 and for @xmath68 on @xmath41 ( or @xmath33 ) which show that such cancellations do not occur .",
    "instead of doing so , we find it more convenient to present an explicit example where the last two terms in ( [ meancurv ] ) do not cancel each other . for completeness",
    ", we also evaluate @xmath69 and @xmath70 explicitly on this example and show that ( [ hatj ] ) is not valid .    for the example",
    ", we consider spherical coordinates @xmath71 on minkowski and consider the past null cone of the origin @xmath72 defined by the coordinates @xmath73 .",
    "this past null cone @xmath74 is defined by the equation @xmath75 .",
    "we consider an axially symmetric ( with respect to the killing vector @xmath76 ) spacelike surface @xmath33 embedded in @xmath74 .",

    "we need to determine the vector field @xmath82 as a function of the spacetime coordinates @xmath83 .",
    "the condition that @xmath35 is paralelly propagated along @xmath38 means that @xmath84 does not depend of @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ ont ] ) on @xmath33 require @xmath88 since @xmath89 it follows @xmath90 .",
    "thus , in spherical coordinates , @xmath91 .",
    "the component @xmath92 of the geodesic equation @xmath93 takes the explicit form @xmath94 evaluating this expression on @xmath95 and using ( [ expre ] ) it is now straightforward to obtain @xmath96 applying a similar argument it follows that the last term of @xmath97 takes the form @xmath98 it is clear that ( [ third ] ) and ( [ fourth ] ) do not cancel each other in general . as mentioned above we complete the argument by writing down the explicit expressions for @xmath56 , @xmath99 , @xmath70 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is a matter of simple calculation to obtain @xmath100 substituting these expressions in the right - hand side of ( [ hatj ] ) gives @xmath101 which is clearly different to the expression for @xmath102 in ( [ meanval ] ) .",
