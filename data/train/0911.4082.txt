    "this process initially leads to well - connected families of highly homologous proteins , that are interconnected at later stages by links with smaller values of @xmath26 , resembling the requirements for explosive percolation explained in ref .",

    "this behavior can be seen in the size of the largest component as links are added to the network ( fig .",
    "[ largest_component_phn ] ) . clearly , the largest cluster in the network remains very small even when we have added a significant number of links , e.g. as much as 80% of the total network links .",
    "this small size is an indication that links are added locally , and up to a given weight there is not a significantly large spanning cluster .",
    "the subsequent addition a relatively small number of links , causes the entire network to become connected through the merging of the small clusters in one spanning entity .",
    "this behavior is similar to the one observed when we employ a purely pr achlioptas process for the same number of nodes ( without considering the h - phn links ) .",
    "the product rule , as described in the previous section , favors small clusters that increase slowly in size until the explosion stage where the spanning cluster emerges , which can explain the similarities between the two curves in the plot , despite the sharper transition of the pr model compared to the real data of h - phn .",

    "links with small values of @xmath26 connect dissimilar proteins which , in general , do not belong to the same module . therefore , a link with a small value of @xmath26 is equivalent to a long - range connection , which leads to a rapid growth of the largest cluster and leaves all the other components small .",
    "this also explains the linear increase of @xmath27 with @xmath22 , where almost every new link attaches itself to the largest cluster .",
    "random link addition has a milder effect , in accordance to the idea of percolation in random networks , where after a critical @xmath22 value the largest cluster size increases following a second - order transition .",

    "is then plotted as a function of the links fraction @xmath22 that have been added up to that point . for the case of decreasing order of weights ,",
    "this product remains very small until we have added roughly 80% of the network links .",
    "this shows that we only connect very small clusters with each other .",
    "near the transition point , though , this value increases abruptly and peaks at values much larger than the network size , showing that we merge progressively larger clusters .",
    "similar is the case for the explosive percolation , where the peak is even more pronounced . in both cases , it is only at the late stages that the product @xmath4 becomes large and greatly exceeds the network size . on the other hand , when links are added in increasing order",
    "the product @xmath4 grows linearly with time until it reaches its maximum at @xmath29 , where @xmath1 is the size of the network .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ largest_component_phn ] , where almost all new links are added to the largest cluster , so that with high probability @xmath30 and @xmath31 , resulting in a linear increase .",
    "when links are added at random , we observe the expected percolation transition at @xmath32 , after which the giant component grows rapidly and spans the entire network .",

    "[ component_size_dist ] we compare the cluster size distribution , @xmath28 , for the pr process , random percolation and the h - phn . below the percolation transition , when the size of the largest component is 1000 nodes ( upper left panel of fig .  [ component_size_dist ] ) , @xmath28 presents a similar behavior for all three processes , following roughly a power - law decay .",
    "thus , clusters of all sizes ( up to the largest one ) appear in the network , with the pr model showing a slight preference towards larger clusters . as , though , we move closer to the percolation transition ( see upper right and lower left panels of fig .",
    "[ component_size_dist ] ) , the random process leads to a dominant largest cluster , with the remaining components being orders of magnitude smaller than the spanning cluster .",
    "in contrast , the distribution , @xmath28 , for the pr process and the h - phn remains a power - law , indicating the existence of many clusters of significant size .",
    "when we consider @xmath28 above the transition point ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ component_size_dist ] ) , the largest component dominates in all three processes , although the pr process and the h - phn display a persistence of clusters of intermediate size .",
    "this behavior highlights the similarities in the explosive behavior , even at a microscopic level , between the h - phn and the pr model .",
    "figure  [ cool ] depicts the process of cluster formation and the corresponding connections between them as the value of @xmath26 is lowered , or equivalently as we add more links according to decreasing weight .",
    "the underlying network representation , i.e. the spatial positions of each protein , is based on a kamada - kawaii  @xcite algorithm on the final connected network ( at @xmath24 ) .",
    "clearly , a large number of clusters are created very early in the process and they retain their identity even for large values of @xmath22 .",
    "for example , even when we have added 60% of the total links the ten largest clusters are more or less the same as the ones that were present at @xmath33 .",
    "as we increase @xmath22 even further a larger component starts to appear at roughly @xmath34 , but even at @xmath35 we can clearly detect isolated modules that are not yet attached to the spanning cluster . the largest component seems to grow by absorbing dense clusters .",
    "the process of adding links from high to low weights not only resembles the conditions for explosive percolation but can also be considered analogous to the product rule presented in ref .  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have shown that , on the average , when new links are added to the network they connect clusters in a way that the product of their component sizes remains small , and therefore the growth of the largest component is delayed . in the opposite case , when low weight links are added first , an accelerated growth of the largest component is observed .",
    "our results indicate that a modular network , such as h - phn , can be well - described through the idea of explosive percolation , although one can not conclusively characterize the nature of the transition , since finite size scaling is not possible in real - world networks .",
    "it is important , though , to remark that a one - to - one correspondence between the h - phn and the achlioptas process is in principle impossible to determine : the competition between links in an achlioptas process is extremely hard ( if possible ) to detect in real - world networks because one has only indirect knowledge of the links preference to be established during network growth .",
    "for this reason we may only detect features of an achlioptas process by studying the main properties leading to a sharp transition , and not the mechanism itself . in this sense ,",
    "the competition between links in the h - phn is inherent in the weights of links , which are determined using purely biological information . a strong indication of the similarity between the achlioptas process and the h - phn is shown in fig .",
    "[ component_product ] , where the product of the components that are connected during the addition of links remains small for small values of @xmath22 and has a sharp peak ( that greatly exceeds the size of the network ) at a late stage in the process .",
    "the sharp transition of the h - phn is not a universal property ascribed to weighted networks .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ largest_component_phn ] shows that when the link weights of the h - phn are shuffled without modifying the structure of the network , we observe a smooth percolation transition that appears at an early stage in the addition of links .",
    "similarly , the same growth pattern emerges in another strongly modular network , the network of movie actors obtained from imdb in which two actors are connected if they co - acted in a movie .",
    "the weight of a link corresponds to the number of movies in which they co - acted .",
    "although the imdb network displays a strong community structure and is organized in well - defined modules , there are many inter - module links at early stages , and therefore the giant component emerges continuously . in both cases the link weight distribution cancels out the effect of the modular substrate",
    "therefore , we find that sharp percolation transition is not necessarily inherent in networks with well - defined communities . instead , the sharpness of the transition strongly depends on the way in which the network evolves during the addition of links .",

    "this network is composed of proteins in the human cell , where two proteins are linked if they are homologous .",

    "is quantified through the score ratio @xmath26 , which for two proteins 1 and 2 is defined as @xmath40 the self - alignment score in the denominator properly normalizes the score @xmath41 , so that it takes into account e.g. the varying length between two otherwise similar proteins .",
