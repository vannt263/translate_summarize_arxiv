    "if @xmath263 is the @xmath265-design , then @xmath267 , and so by theorem  [ pseudo ] , @xmath268 is obtained from the @xmath160-design by adding a new point to all of its blocks .",

    "it follows that @xmath251 is the incidence matrix of the @xmath281-design . by ( [ n2 ] ) , @xmath282 .",

    "we need to mention the spectrum of the graphs @xmath291 and @xmath221 : @xmath292    the graph @xmath19 is ds for @xmath64 .    any cospectral mate @xmath293 of @xmath19 for @xmath64 must have one of the graphs of theorems  [ l_n ] and [ s_n ] as a connected component .",

    "considering the number of edges , @xmath300 , for any @xmath298 , can not be a component of @xmath293 .",
    "the same is for @xmath221 as the equation @xmath301 has no integral solution .",
    "the graphs @xmath184 belong to a family of trees called _ starlike tree _ ( trees with only one vertex of degree larger than 2 ) . in @xcite , it was asked to determine which starlike trees are ds .",
    "partial results are obtained by several authors ( see the survey @xcite ) . for this",
    "specific starlike trees , brouwer @xcite showed that the graphs @xmath184 are ds among trees . here , we completely determine the spectral characterization of the graphs @xmath184 .",
    "the proof is the same as proof of the above corollary .",
    "[ sds ] the graph @xmath15 is ds if @xmath302 , where @xmath303 moreover , for @xmath304 we have    * @xmath305 has exactly two cospectral mates which are @xmath306 and @xmath307 ; * @xmath308 has exactly one cospectral mate which is @xmath309 ; * @xmath310 has exactly four cospectral mates which are @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 , and @xmath314 ; * @xmath315 has exactly one cospectral mates which is @xmath316 ; * if @xmath317 and @xmath318 is not an integer of the form @xmath319 , then @xmath15 has exactly two cospectral mates which are @xmath320 and @xmath321 ; * if @xmath322 , @xmath323 , and @xmath324 , then @xmath15 has exactly three cospectral mates which are @xmath325 , @xmath326 , and @xmath327 ; * if @xmath322 , @xmath318 is odd , and @xmath328 , then @xmath15 has exactly one cospectral mate which is @xmath325 ; * if @xmath329 , then @xmath15 has exactly one cospectral mate which is @xmath330 .",
    "the graph @xmath331 , has exactly three cospectral mates , namely @xmath332 , @xmath333 , and @xmath334 .",

    "the only cospectral mate of @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "in this section we characterize all graphs of order @xmath9 whose spectrum contains either @xmath11 with multiplicity @xmath12 or a zero and @xmath11 with multiplicity @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that , up to isomorphism , there are exactly six such graphs , all of which are obtained in some way from the fano plane .      *",

    "so @xmath349 and equalities must occur in all the above inequalities .",
    "hence two cases may occur : 1 ) @xmath350 and @xmath351 which implies @xmath352 and @xmath353 ; or 2 ) @xmath354 and @xmath355 which implies @xmath356 and @xmath357 .",
    "again , like the proof of theorem  [ s_n ] , @xmath22 can be rearranged so that @xmath249 in which @xmath251 , with @xmath256 rows , say , correspond to the vertices with smaller degrees .",
    "then in the same manner as the proof of theorem  [ s_n ] , we see that @xmath358 , where @xmath318 is either 16 or 36 . as @xmath251 is either @xmath359 or @xmath360 , it is the incidence matrix of either a @xmath361-design or a pseudo @xmath361-design .",
