    "precise measurements of timing variations of strictly periodic events have been successfully used to infer the existence bodies orbiting around distant stars .",
    "perhaps the best - known examples are the pulsar planets of @xcite , a system of three extremely low - mass planets orbiting the millisecond pulsar psr1257 + 12 .",
    "pulsating sub - dwarf b stars have also been found to host planets , e.g.  v391 peg @xcite and hw vir @xcite . this same technique has recently been applied to eclipsing polars , using the egress of the small , bright accretion spot as a precise `` clock . ''",
    "unseen orbiting bodies can cause small shifts in the timing of eclipses ( ranging from @xmath310  sec to a few minutes ) due to the light - travel time differences imposed by the gravitational influence of the orbiting bodies on the system barycentre .",
    "@xcite discovered the first such planet orbiting the eclipsing polar dp leo by combining their observed eclipse timings with a long - term data set from @xcite ; the combined data set revealed a sinusoidal variation indicative of a 6.3  planet with a period of 23.8  years .",
    "the timing method has shown that planets can orbit stars which are wildly different from the main - sequence solar - type stars most commonly targeted by doppler and transit planet search programs .",
    "in a recent letter , @xcite announced the discovery of two ( and potentially more ) giant planets orbiting the eclipsing polar hu aquarii ( hereafter hu aqr ) .",
    "the authors provided fits to the orbits of those planets , placing them at orbital radii of 3.6 and 5.4  au , from the system barycentre , and ascribed minimum masses of 5.9 and 4.5  ( respectively ) to the two bodies . in this letter",
    ", we perform a detailed dynamical analysis of the hu aqr planetary system in order to assess the stability of the proposed planet candidates .",
    "in their study of the eclipsing polar system hu aqr , @xcite consider the temporal variation in the observed eclipse timings ( `` o '' ) as compared to predicted timings ( `` c '' ) that would be expected from a linear ephemeris . by plotting a simple @xmath7 diagram , they show that the @xmath7 residuals for hu aqr contain two cyclical signals superposed on a longer - period curvature .",
    "each signal can be modelled as a keplerian orbit to determine the planetary parameters .",
    "we reproduce the parameter estimates of @xcite in table  [ planetparams ] . as for planets detected with by radial - velocity method ,",
    "only the radial component of the planet s influence on the host star is detectable . here ,",
    "only the line - of - sight light - travel time differences are observed , so the mass estimates for the hu aqr planets are given as minimum values .",
    "@xcite note that the hu aqr system inclination is @xmath8 , so , if the planets orbit in the same plane as the stars , their true masses would only be 0.4% larger than the minimum values given in table  [ planetparams ] .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to examine the potential dynamical stability of the two planets suggested for the hu aqr system , we performed a large number of detailed dynamical simulations using the _ hybrid _ integrator within the @xmath9-body dynamical package _ mercury _ @xcite . following the strategy employed to analyse the stability of the hr  8799 system @xcite , we held the orbit of the inner planet constant ( with @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and varied the orbital elements of the outer planet across a range corresponding to @xmath123 times the discovery letter s quoted uncertainties in the semi - major axis , @xmath13 , and eccentricity , @xmath14 .",
    "we initially considered the scenario described in @xcite , where the planets are considered to be co - planar .",
    "in other words , we set the orbital inclinations , @xmath15 , of the two planets to be 0@xmath6 at the start of our integrations .",
    "we treat the central stars , a 0.88  white dwarf and a 0.2  secondary , as a single point mass .",
    "since the stars orbit each other with a period of only 2.08 hours ( i.e.  with a separation of 0.004  au ) , and the bodies of interest are believed to orbit at distances of 3.6 and 5.4  au , this treatment is dynamically justified .",
    "we give each planet the minimum mass estimated in @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that , if the masses of the proposed planets are significantly greater than those detailed in @xcite , then this could only have a deleterious effect on the stability of their proposed orbits .",
    "fixing the orbit of the inner planet , we simulated a total of 9261 planetary systems . in each simulated system , the inner planet began on the same orbit , but the orbital elements of the outer planet were chosen such that each simulation sampled a unique set of possible parameters .",
    "we distributed the orbital elements of the outer planet such that we tested 21 values of semi - major axis , spread evenly across @xmath123-@xmath4 from the value ( @xmath16  au ) given in @xcite . for each value of semi - major axis , we tested 21 values of orbital eccentricity , again spread evenly across @xmath123-@xmath4 from the value ( @xmath17 ) , given in that work . finally , at each of these 441 @xmath18 locations we carried out 21 tests , with the initial location of the planet distributed across a range of @xmath123-@xmath4 from the nominal mean anomaly of the outer planet ( calculated from fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "these 9261 unique models , based on the hu aqr system parameters , were integrated using the _ hybrid _ integrator within _ mercury _ for a period of 100  myr , following the evolution and final fates of the two postulated planets in the system .",
    "a planet was deemed ejected from the system upon reaching a distance of 1000  au from the barycentre , and all mutual collisions were recorded .",
    "this yielded a lifetime from each individual integration in the range 0 - 100  myr , defined as the time until one or other of the planets was removed from the system through either collision or ejection .    to explore the 1-@xmath4 parameter range in greater detail",
    ", we launched a second suite of integrations , again using 9261 test systems .",
    "the set - up was performed exactly as described above , except that the orbital parameters of the outer planet were varied within a 1-@xmath4 range , rather than the 3-@xmath4 distribution carried out previously .",
    "these two suites of integrations yielded 17493 distinct tests of the stability of the hu aqr system , with 9261 of these performed in the central @xmath121-@xmath4 of the element space described in @xcite , and the other 8232 distributed in the range 1-@xmath4 to 3-@xmath4 .",
    "the results of these integrations are shown in fig  [ coplanar ] .    once these simulations had been completed , we carried out equivalent suites for scenarios where the outer planet was moving on an orbit inclined to that of the inner planet . following the procedure detailed above , we tested systems in which the outer planet s orbit was inclined by 5@xmath6 , 15@xmath6 and 45@xmath6 with respect to the inner s orbit , in order to examine the influence of mutual orbital inclinations on the stability of the system .",
    "we then considered further scenarios in which the outer planet was moving in a retrograde sense , with respect to the inner body , with inclinations of 135@xmath6 and 180@xmath6 . for simplicity",
    ", we kept the masses of the two planets constant through these runs at the lowest values suggested in @xcite .",
    "although it is true that significantly inclined orbits for the planets would result in larger real masses for them , we note that a significant mutual inclination between the planets does not necessarily mean that it is the outermost planet that is inclined to the line of sight , while the innermost is in that plane . rather than attempt to shift the planetary mass by the free parameter of potential inclination",
    ", we instead took the lowest masses possible .",
    "we remind the reader that this essentially means that we have allowed the planetary system the best possible chance of being stable - as the mass of the planets increases , so does their gravitational reach , increasing the strength of any mutual interactions .",
    "the results of our @xmath190@xmath6 ( i.e. coplanar ) dynamical integrations are shown in fig  [ coplanar ] .",
    "each colour box in that figure shows the median lifetime obtained from 21 independent integrations performed with the outer planet placed on an orbit with that particular combination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the location of the inner planet is marked with a hollow circle , whilst the location of the nominal orbit for the outer planet given in @xcite is shown by a hollow square , with the 1-@xmath4 error bars given in that work denoted by the solid lines stretching from that square .",
    "the vertical dot - dash lines show the locations of the strongest mean - motion resonances ( hereafter mmr ) with the orbit of the inner - most planet .",
    "the curved dotted lines that meet at the location of the inner planet join all orbits whose periastron ( outward curving line ) or apastron ( inward curving line ) lie at a distance equal to the orbital radius of the inner planet . every point in the region above these lines denotes orbits for the outer planet that cross that of the inner .",
    "the two dotted lines labelled 3@xmath20 and 5@xmath20 connect orbits which pass periastron at a distance equal to the orbital radius of the inner planet plus 3 and 5 times that planet s hill radius ( ) , respectively , where  is defined as    @xmath21    the hill radius , , is commonly used in studies of orbital dynamics as a proxy for the dynamical `` reach '' of a given body @xcite .",
    "close encounters between two massive bodies are typically defined as those that occur at a distance closer than 3 , although some particularly conservative studies consider 5  a sufficiently close approach to be labeled as such .",
    "these lines therefore show the limits at which the outer planet approaches the inner within the prescribed number of   those orbits outside the lines are too widely separated at the start of the integrations to undergo close encounters , while all those within the region bounded by the periastron and apastron lines for the orbital radius of the inner planet are orbits which cross that of that planet .",
    "it is immediately apparent in fig  [ coplanar ] that the great majority of possible orbits suggested in @xcite are extremely unstable , with just a small region at low eccentricities and high semi - major axes ( i.e. below the 3  line in the bottom right - hand corner ) showing any significant long term stability .",
    "this is not a surprising result - the two planets in question have particularly large masses , and therefore have very large dynamical reaches - and so must be widely separated in order that they do not strongly perturb one another .",
    "indeed , it is clear from that figure that the regions of stability and instability for the hu aqr system are a strong function of the peri- and apastron distances of the initial orbits of the outer planet .",
    "the only orbits that display relatively strong stability all have periastron at distances greater than 5  beyond the orbit of the inner planet .",
    "any closer , and the encounters between the planets are strongly disruptive .",
    "orbits of the outer planet which approach the inner planet to a distance between 3 and 5  are clearly more stable than those which come closer to that planet , but still display significant instability on astronomically short timescales .",
    "parameter space in a grid of 21@xmath121 points .",
    "the central 1-@xmath4 parameter space is covered by an additional and denser set of 21@xmath121 points .",
    "each grid point is the median lifetime of 21 simulated hu aqr systems with the outer planet s initial @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the location of the inner planet is denoted by the point of the solid triangle on the x - axis , while the nominal orbit of the outer planet is marked by the filled square .",
    "solid lines show the extent of the 1-@xmath4 errors in @xmath13 and @xmath14 suggested by @xcite .",
    "the vertical dot - dashed lines show the location of the strongest mmrs in relation to the orbit of the inner planet .",
    "the two dotted lines radiating from the location of the inner planet connect all orbits of that have either their periastron ( outward curving line ) or apastron ( inward curving line ) at the location of the planet .",
    "as such , all orbits in the region bounded by these lines cross the orbit of the inner planet .",
    "the dotted lines labelled @xmath22 and @xmath23 connect all orbits that pass periastron at a distance of three or five hill radii beyond the orbit of the inner planet .",
    "it can readily be seen that the planetary system shows extreme instability , aside from in a small region of @xmath13-@xmath14 space to the lower right hand side of the figure , corresponding to orbits of the outer planet that remain at a barycentric distance beyond @xmath36  au . ]    however , what of mutual inclinations between the two planets ? could the system be stabilised by the planets moving on orbits that are significantly inclined with respect to one another ?",
    "this question can be answered by examination of fig  [ sixplot ] , which presents the results for all six scenarios considered in this work .",
    "as the orbital inclination of the outer planet is increased to 5@xmath6 and then 15@xmath6 , the overall stability of the system appears to increase somewhat , with the yellow and orange colours that denote moderate stability spreading across the entire plot .",
    "however , the effect of increased inclination on the region of greatest stability , those orbits with median lifetimes greater than one million years , is negligible .",
    "indeed , by the time the inclination is increased to 15@xmath6 , that region appears to shrink somewhat , with particular destabilisation occurring just inwards of the location of the 5:2 mmr with the orbit of the inner planet .",
    "once the orbital inclination of the outer planet is increased to 45@xmath6 ( top right hand panel ) , this effect becomes far more pronounced , with only small regions of stability remaining in low - eccentricity orbits around the 2:1 mmr , around the 5:2 mmr , and a larger region beyond the location of the 3:1 mmr .",
    "indeed , far from enha ncing the stability of the planetary system , as might be expected , the 3:1 mmr acts to destabilise the orbits of the planets in this more highly inclined scenario .",
    "the central panel on the right hand side of fig  [ sixplot ] shows the scenario for which the orbit of the outer planet is inclined by 135@xmath6 to that of the inner .",
    "that scenario displays a remarkable lack of stability across the entire 3-@xmath4 region of plausible orbits for the outer planet .",
    "the only scenario in which orbits within the 1-@xmath4 uncertainty range for the outer planet display strong stability is shown in the lower - right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ sixplot ] ( @xmath19180@xmath6 ) , when the orbit is both retrograde and coplanar . in that scenario ,",
    "almost all orbits for the outer planet not crossing that of the inner are dynamically stable on long timescales . in that",
    "extreme scenario , even some configurations in which the orbits of the two planets cross show significant stability .",
    "those scenarios are the only ones of our entire suite of almost 105,000 test integrations in which orbits of the hu aqr planets situated within the 1-@xmath4 error bounds stipulated in @xcite can display any long - term stability .",
    "we have investigated the stability of the recently discovered planetary system around hu aqr across the @xmath123-@xmath4 uncertainty ranges for the orbit of the outer planet . in the simplest ,",
    "coplanar , case , we find that the system is unstable on timescales @xmath24 years , except for scenarios in which the mutual separation between the two planets was greater than 5  at the outer planet s periastron .",
    "when the orbit of the outer planet is set such that it reaches periastron between 3  and 5  beyond the orbit of the inner planet , the orbital stability is somewhat greater than scenarios where the minimum separation between the two planets is smaller then 3  , but the planetary system still falls apart on timescales too short to inspire any confidence that the tested orbits represent the true state of the hu aqr system . we see a steady increase in the median lifetime of the system across much of the tested phase - space as the mutual inclination of the orbits climbs from the coplanar case , through 5@xmath6 to 15@xmath6 to 45@xmath6 , as expected from the resulting reduction in the amount of time the two planets spend in close proximity .",
    "however , even in the most extreme prograde case investigated ( @xmath25 ) , the lifetime of systems within the 1-@xmath4 parameter space did not exceed @xmath26years .",
    "this is much shorter than the expected system age , suggesting that we have either caught the system during a period of significant dynamical instability in which the planets are undergoing a rearrangement / ejection , or that the orbital solution described in @xcite does not represent the true state of the system .",
    "interestingly , although an increase in the mutual inclination of the planetary orbits causes those orbits in the unstable region to become slightly more stable , it also results in a reduction in the stable region at distances greater than 5  from the inner planet .",
    "if the orbit of the outer planet is retrograde compared to that of the inner planet , but the orbits remain coplanar ( i.e. the mutual inclination of the two orbits is 180@xmath6 , then we find that the system could be stable across a wide range of parameter space , including some scenarios within the 1-@xmath4 errors quoted for the orbit of the outer planet .",
    "however , it seems difficult to comprehend how the proposed planets could have evolved into such orbits .",
    "by contrast , if the orbits of the two planets have mutual inclinations of 135@xmath6 , then we find that no region of the tested @xmath13-@xmath14 phase space is stable on timescales greater than @xmath27  years .",
    "the results of our dynamical simulations raise a number of interesting possibilities .",
    "assuming that the detection of the planets by @xcite is robust , and that the orbits of the planets at the current epoch are exactly as described in that work , the planetary system must be going through a dramatic period of dynamical instability , which will in short order result in the loss of one ( or both ) of the planets therein . however , the incredibly short lifetimes we find for the proposed planets suggest that , statistically , this is unlikely ( the odds of observing a planetary system during the last few thousand years of a multi - billion - year lifetime seem remarkably small ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume that the detection of the planets is robust , but the orbital parameters given are not a good measure of the true state of the system , we suggest that it is most likely that the outer planet is moving on a low - eccentricity orbit far from the central bodies .",
    "such an orbit would allow that planet to remain sufficiently far from the inner planet to be dynamically stable on multi - million year timescales , and therefore seems a much more reasonable solution for the dynamics of the system .",
    "if the two planets detected by @xcite have significant mutual orbital inclinations , then we find that a slightly wider range of orbits are possible for the outer planet to display moderate stability , but that at the same time the region of greatest stability for that planet s orbit actually reduces in size . in any case , in such scenarios the stable regions remain relatively restrictive both in terms of orbital eccentricity and semi - major axis - keeping the planet well beyond the inner s sphere of influence .",
    "the only way in which the orbits of the two planets can be induced to show significant stability is to consider a scenario in which they are coplanar , but with the orbit of the outer planet being retrograde with respect to that of the inner .",
    "in such a scenario , a wide area of the studied @xmath13-@xmath14 phase space becomes dynamically stable , including some solutions within the 1-@xmath4 uncertainties detailed by @xcite .",
    "whilst this might appear promising , we note that it is hard to envision a way in which the planets could evolve into such an unusual configuration without significantly destabilising one another s orbits .",
    "when one examines the residuals from the o - c diagram in the @xcite work , a first glance suggests that a low - eccentricity orbit for the outer planet is incompatible with the observed data .",
    "however , it is possible that the removal of the long - term quadratic trend by @xcite could have resulted in an artificially enhanced eccentricity for the outer planet , reducing its stability .",
    "on the other hand , detailed simulations of doppler velocity data by @xcite demonstrated that two planets in circular orbits can mimic the signal of a single planet on an eccentric orbit , so long as those planets move on mutually resonant orbits .",
    "this possibility was recently explored by @xcite for the case of hd  38283b , an eccentric planet in a one - year orbit .",
    "if , rather than a highly eccentric second planet , we have a scenario where the system contains at least three massive planets , each moving on low - eccentricity orbits , it might be possible to explain the suggested shape of the o - c diagram in @xcite whilst placing the planets on orbits that are dynamically stable .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggest that there might be a third massive body at a large barycentric distance , based on the archaic titius - bode law .",
    "while the use of that law is not generally encouraged as a predictive tool in exoplanetary science , the presence of a more distant third body would allow orbital fits with the second planet moving on a low - eccentricity orbit .",
    "although we have not dynamically simulated such a speculative scenario , it seems reasonable to assume that if a third planet were located at an orbital radius at least 5  beyond that of the second planet , the system could display long term dynamical stability without violating the observed variations in the egress of the accretion hotspot from eclipse by the stellar secondary body .",
    "a more detailed statistical analysis of this highly fascinating exoplanetary system is clearly necessary in order to disentangle the true nature of the proposed planetary system .",
    "such work will doubtless throw fresh light on one of the most peculiar planetary systems detected to date .",
