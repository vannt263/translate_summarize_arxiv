    "cuprate superconductors are characterized by cuo@xmath4 planes which are rather isolated from each other by intervening rare earth atoms .",
    "the larger (  @xmath5-axis \" ) separation of cu atoms perpendicular to the planes compared to the in - plane lattice constants ( @xmath6 ) has focused theoretical attention on the magnetic and superconducting properties of two - dimensional models , most notably the square lattice heisenberg and hubbard hamiltonians .",
    "indeed , one of the most fundamental theoretical questions which arose in the initial investigations of possible models of high temperature superconductivity concerned the nature of the magnetism in the ground states of these hamiltonians : were they spin - liquids or did they exhibit long range order ? it was established numerically@xcite that both the heisenberg hamiltonian and the half - filled hubbard hamiltonian have long range antiferromagnetic order at @xmath7 .",
    "a still - unresolved question is the nature of pairing in the doped hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "a natural extension of these single layer questions concerns the behavior of spin and pairing correlations in coupled planes .",
    "interlayer connections are required to elevate the magnetic ordering , which is possible only at @xmath7 in two dimensions , to the finite temperature nel transitions observed experimentally .",
    "similarly , the superconducting transition temperature tends to increase with the number of adjacent cuo@xmath4 layers between the charge resevoirs , getting steadily larger from single layered la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 , to bilayer ybacu@xmath11o@xmath12 to the hgbacacuo sequence where @xmath13 peaks at about @xmath14 k for materials with @xmath15 layers @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetism and thus superconductivity exhibit the expected behavior that adding additional ( non - frustrating ) couplings , and increasing the dimensionality , enhances the tendency to order .",
    "the route from 2d to 3d is , however , not completely straightforward .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) studies of coupled heisenberg layers@xcite , have shown that when the interplane coupling grows sufficiently large , there is a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) from a ground state with long range magnetic order to a spin - gapped ground state , in which singlets form between pairs of spins in the two planes@xcite .",
    "a similar effect is seen in qmc studies of the two - layer half - filled hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the basic phenomenon of singlet formation usurping magnetic order in itinerant fermion hamiltonians does not crucially depend on having the same interaction strength @xmath0 , or hopping @xmath16 , for the two species .",
    "indeed , a hamiltonian with @xmath1 in one ( conduction ) band and hopping @xmath17 in another ( localized ) band , is the commonly encountered periodic anderson model ( pam ) . at half - filling , for weak hybridization between the conduction and localized bands , antiferromagnetic",
    "order is present . as the hybridization grows bigger , however ,",
    " kondo \" singlets form and destroy antiferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "thus the pam exhibits a similar qpt as for two identical hubbard layers ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "this close similarity of the pam and hubbard bilayers emphasizes that the physics of fermions in multiple layers can equivalently be interpreted in in terms of multiple orbitals .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the possibility of analogous phenomena in the case when there is an _ attractive _ interaction .",
    "more specifically , we examine the nature of pairing correlations for coupled planes ( orbitals ) in situations when an attraction is present only in one plane ( orbital ) .",
    "we use the @xmath20 hubbard hamiltonian as an appropriate simple model , and employ a combination of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) mean field theory .",
    "we will focus on a case analogous to that of the pam , namely when @xmath1 in one of the layers .",
    "we are interested in both how the interlayer hopping affects the @xmath21-wave pairing correlations in a layer with @xmath3 , and also whether pairing can be induced by a  proximity effect \" in the @xmath1 layer",
    ". such behavior would be directly analogous to the  rkky \" spin polarization cloud which is induced in the conduction band by the presence of the local moments in the pam .",
    "a particularly interesting issue is whether the qpt which occurs at commensurate filling also occurs in the doped case .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we write down the precise model and give an overview of the qmc and bdg computational methodologies .",
    "iii and iv present the bdg and qmc results respectively .",
    "v recaps our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the two layer ( orbital ) attractive hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath22 here an intralayer kinetic energy term @xmath23 describes the creation of a fermion with spin @xmath24 on site @xmath25 of layer @xmath26 and its destruction on site @xmath27 of the same layer . a second interlayer kinetic energy term @xmath28 hybridizes the two layers @xmath29 .",
    "fermions of different spin feel an attractive interaction @xmath30 on layer @xmath26 .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath31 control the filling .",
    "our lattice geometry consists of two coupled square lattice of linear size @xmath32 .",
    "we choose @xmath33 in the ` superconducting ' plane and @xmath34 in the metallic one .    at half - filling ,",
    "a particle - hole transformation formalizes the similarity of the repulsive and attractive models .",
    "the vanishing of antiferromagnetic order with increasing @xmath2 for @xmath35 bilayers immediately implies that ground state pairing ( and charge density wave order , with which it is degenerate ) must be destroyed as @xmath2 grows for @xmath3 . however , whereas af order occurs only at half - filling ( and only at @xmath7 ) in the 2d repulsive hubbard hamiltonian , superconductivity appears away from half - filling , and at a finite ( kosterlitz - thouless ) transition temperature @xcite , in the attractive hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "this opens up fundamentally new issues in the attractive case . whether the fermions on sites in adjacent layers will still lock into a local object and destroy long range order when the filling is incommensurate is an interesting question .",
    "the absence of a sign problem in the case of the attractive hubbard model enables the study of low temperatures even when the filling is incommensurate , allowing access to ground state properties .",
    "we perform  determinant \" qmc @xcite simulations of the hamiltonian , eq .  [ eq : ham ] by writing down a path integral for the partition function @xmath36 .",
    "the exponential of the interaction term @xmath37 is decoupled with a hubbard - stratonovich field which allows the trace of the remaining exponentials of quadratic forms of the fermion operators to be performed analytically .",
    "the result is a sum over configurations of the hubbard - stratonovich field with a weight which takes the form of the product of the determinants of two matrices of dimension the spatial lattice size , one for each spin species . in the case of attractive interaction",
    "the two matrices , and hence their determinants , are identical , so that the weight is a perfect square and there is no sign problem .",
    "we present results here for the real space pair correlation functions in the two orbitals , @xmath38 and also their associated structure factors , @xmath39 as a functions of interband hybridization @xmath2 , on - site attraction @xmath37 , density @xmath40 , and temperature @xmath41 .",
    "the long distance behavior of @xmath42 yields the square of the superconducting order parameter , as does the lattice size dependence of the structure factor .",

    "a related bdg treatment of superconductivity in the presence of randomness ( spatially varying @xmath46 ) is given in [ ] .",
    "@xmath47 includes a site - dependent hartree shift with @xmath48 .    in the general case ,",
    "when inhomogeneous terms are present in the hamiltonian , or are expected to develop spontaneously , ( like the charge and spin stripes of the doped , repulsive hubbard model ) , the order parameter and densities are allowed to depend on site index and the diagonalization must be done numerically . if translation invariance is present , eq .",
    "[ eq : hbdg ] can be diagonalized analytically by going to momentum space .",
    "the resulting momentum sums are typically still done numerically , but larger lattices can be studied .",
    "we have implemented both approaches in the work presented here .",
    "although inhomogeneous hartree - fock theory allows for spatial variation of the densities and superconducting order parameters , the expectation values in eq .",
    "[ eq : hbdg ] are independent of imaginary time , unlike the fluctuating hubbard - stratonovich field in the qmc approach .",
    "this leads to a less accurate treatment of interparticle correlations , but a numerically much more simple problem .",
    "in particular , larger spatial lattices can be studied , and the bdg solution can exhibit broken symmetry so that @xmath49 itself can be nonzero , rather than having to be extracted from the asymptotics of the correlation function eq .  2 . here",
    "the combination of qmc and bdg will serve to provide complementary information .    in the case of the bdg calculations our focus will be on the value of the order parameter @xmath49 as a function of the same parameters as varied in the qmc . as mentioned above , the asymptotic value of @xmath50 is a measure of @xmath51 .",
    "the bdg approach , since it neglects fluctuations , yields larger values of @xmath49 than those of the qmc , which is an exact method .",
    "the results of bdg calculations are summarized in fig .  [ bfig : bdg ] .",

    "we present extensive qmc results to confirm and complement the bdg results .",

    "[ fig : pfss2 ] shows that @xmath93 increases systematically as @xmath0 changes from @xmath94 to @xmath95 and , indeed , shows no sign of saturation .",
    "this is at variance with the behavior of the magnetic response of the repulsive hubbard hamiltonian which first increases with @xmath0 but then reaches a maximum at @xmath96 before falling .",
