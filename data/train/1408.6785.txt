    "this `` large '' spin may still be rather quantum due to unusual multipolar interactions , but may also be reduced to an effective @xmath4 one by a structural transition or quadrupolar ordering , either of which may reduce the cubic symmetry .",
    "prior theoretical work in an @xmath3 model suggested a transition to tetragonal symmetry indeed may occur .",
    "if this transition occurs at a temperature large compared to magnetic scales , an @xmath4 hamiltonian can provide a more economical description of the latter .",

    "@xcite since the magnetic order sets in only around 10k in this material , it is a strong candidate for the @xmath4 description .    with the general problem and this specific material as motiviation , we study here pure @xmath4 spins on a tetragonally distorted fcc lattice .",

    "this is an accidental degeneracy which is not required by the tetragonal @xmath6 symmetry of the model .",

    "remarkably , fully independently of the hamiltonian parameters , these fluctuations select the four states with magnetization oriented along the @xmath0 axes [ see fig .",

    "the low temperature phase in both models has four possible domains , describable by a @xmath7 order parameter , breaking simultaneously both time - reversal symmetry and lattice rotation symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that the transition to the @xmath7 state occurs in a single , continuous , transition .",
    "we argue this is also a consistent possibility according to renormalization group theory , and predict that the continuous transition is in the 3d xy universality class .",
    "however , if we consider the phonon degrees of freedom , another possibility emerges , since the lattice energy is sensitive to the orthorhombic distortion : spin - lattice coupling may induce an intermediate temperature phase breaking lattice rotations but not time - reversal .",
    "this would be a `` nematic '' state in modern parlance , or simply a paramagnetic orthorhombic state in more conventional terms .",
    "using the theory of critical phenomena , we argue that spin - lattice coupling may indeed induce a nematic phase , but that this occurs only beyond some non - zero threshold coupling strength .",
    "hence , the appearance of a nematic phase implies the presence of strong spin - lattice coupling .",

    "looking further , however , we see that the contribution from spin fluctuations to the fourth order term in the free energy as a function of @xmath271 is _",

    "hence in this limit it seems that the fourth order term in the free energy @xmath282 is negative , and indeed a first order elastic transition obtains .",

    "this means that for sufficiently small @xmath276 , where the instability criterion is not reached before the crossover to the xy regime , there is no instability and the xy critical point is stable , as claimed in the prior subsection .",
