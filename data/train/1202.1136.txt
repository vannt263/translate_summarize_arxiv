    "hence @xmath145 constitute a descending chain and we have arrived at a contradiction .",
    "we have to show that the number of blue points that desire the origin is infinite almost surely .",
    "to this end , define @xmath155 : m_{x}>|x|-1   \\}$ ] , that is , @xmath156 is the set of blue points that desire some point in the interval @xmath157 , and write @xmath158 for the cardinality of @xmath156 . the same argument as in @xcite[theorem 1.3(i ) ] applies to show that @xmath159 a.s .",
    "implies that @xmath44 a.s .",
    "hence we are done if we show that @xmath159 a.s .",
    "the proof of this is analogue to the proof of @xcite[theorem 6(i ) ] for two - color stable matchings :    fix any @xmath160 ; we will prove that @xmath161 . to this end , let @xmath162 be obtained from @xmath27 by adding @xmath41 independent uniformly random red points in @xmath157 . by a straightforward adaptation of @xcite[lemma 18(i ) ] , and independence between @xmath27 and @xmath163 , we have that the law of @xmath164 is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of @xmath165 . by @xcite[proposition 1 ] , almost surely all @xmath41 added red points are matched in the two - color stable multi - matching @xmath129 between @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "let @xmath126 be the two - color stable multi - matching between @xmath27 and @xmath166 .",
    "by lemma [ beauty ] , the blue partners of the @xmath41 added red points were matched at least as far away in @xmath126 , so these blue partners lie in @xmath156 .",
    "thus @xmath167 , as required .",
    "as we have shown , there is no infinite component in the two - color stable multi - matching with constant degree 2 . is this the case also for other degree distributions ?",
    "indeed , we know that @xmath44 for all degree distributions . however , the method employed to show that existence of an infinite component implies that @xmath79 relies heavily on the fact that the structure of an infinite component can be characterized in the degree 2 case .",
    "this does not seem doable for other degree distributions , indicating that another approach is probably neccessary in the general case .",
    "the result that @xmath44 if all components are finite almost surely , proved for the one - color model in @xcite , seems possible to extend to the two - color model , but does not seem to help in answering the above question .",
    "table 1 contains simulation results for some other degree distributions .",
    "( we have chosen to generate a fixed number of points of each color uniformly distributed on a finite cycle , which means that the points do not quite consitute two independent poisson processes . fixing the total number of points and",
    "then randomizing their colours would give a finite representation of our process where the points indeed constitute independent poisson processes , but it would mean that all stubs are not matched and thus lead to difficulties in defining the largest connected component . ) as for deterministic degrees , the relative size of the largest connected component seems to go to 0 for degree 3 , suggesting that there is no infinite component . for constant degree 4 , there is also a clearly decreasing trend , while for constant degree 5 it is difficult to draw any conclusions ",
    "the relative size of the largest component is still large in the largest simulation , but the standard deviation is also large compared to the smaller simulations .",
    "is it the case that there is never percolation for deterministic degrees in @xmath168 ?",
    "if so , does this remain true also when there is randomness in the degrees ? indeed , for a mixture of degrees 2 and 3 and of degrees 3 and 4 , and for poisson(2)+1 degrees , the relative size of the largest component seems to decrease , while for poisson(2)+2 degrees we can not see this in simulations of the current size .",
    "another question concerns the so called random direction stable multi - matching , which is obtained by assigning random directions to the stubs at the poisson points and then do a stable matching of the stubs subject to the restriction that a given stub is to be matched in its prescribed direction . in @xcite , it is shown that the one - color version of this model with constant degree 2 almost surely does not generate an infinite component .",
    "is this true also in the two - color case ?",
    "the two - color version of the model seems more difficult to analyze , since the component structure becomes more involved ."
