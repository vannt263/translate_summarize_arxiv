    "i shall briefly review and compare the basic concepts of two , currently in use , convection models .",
    "the first model is that by gough ( 1977a , b ) , which has been used , for example , by baker & gough ( 1979 ) , balmforth ( 1992 ) and by houdek ( 2000 ) .",
    "the second model is that by unno ( 1967 , 1977 ) , upon which the generalized models by gabriel ( 1996 ) and grigahcne et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are based , with applications by dupret et al .",
    "+ nearly all of the time - dependent convection models assume the boussinesq approximation to the equations of motion .",
    "the boussinesq approximation relies on the fact that the height of the fluid layer is small compared with the density scale height .",
    "it is based on a careful scaling argument and an expansion in small parameters ( spiegel & veronis 1960 ; gough 1969 ) .",
    "the fluctuating convection equations for an inviscid boussinesq fluid in a static plane - parallel atmosphere are @xmath16 supplemented by the continuity equation for an incompressible gas , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the turbulent velocity field , @xmath19 is density , @xmath20 is gas pressure , @xmath21 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath22 is temperature , @xmath23 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the radiative heat flux , @xmath26 is the superadiabatic temperature gradient and @xmath27 is the kronecker delta",
    ". primes  ( @xmath28 ) indicate eulerian fluctuations and overbars horizontal averages .",
    "these are the starting equations for the two physical pictures describing the motion of an overturning convective eddy , illustrated in fig .  1 .    in the first physical picture , adopted by unno ( 1967 ) ,",
    "the turbulent element , with a characteristic vertical length @xmath29 , evolves out of some chaotic state and achieves steady motion very quickly .",
    "the fluid element maintains exact balance between buoyancy force and turbulent drag by continuous exchange of momentum with other elements and its surroundings .",
    "thus the acceleration terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 are neglected and the nonlinear advection terms provide dissipation ( of kinetic energy ) that balances the driving terms .",
    "the nonlinear advection terms are approximated by @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to two nonlinear equations which need to be solved numerically together with the mean equations of the stellar structure .    the second physical picture ,",
    "which was generalized by gough ( 1965 , 1977a , b ) to the time - dependent case , interprets the turbulent flow by indirect analogy with kinetic gas theory .",
    "the motion is not steady and one imagines the convective element to accelerate from rest followed by an instantaneous breakup after the element s lifetime .",
    "thus the nonlinear advection terms are neglected in the convective fluctuation equations ( 1)-(2 ) but are taken to be responsible for the creation and destruction of the convective eddies ( gough 1977a , b ) . by retaining only the acceleration terms the equations become linear with analytical solutions @xmath34 and @xmath35 subject to proper periodic spatial boundary conditions , where @xmath36 is time and @xmath37 is the linear convective growth rate .",
    "the mixing length @xmath29 enters in the calculation of the eddy s survival probability , which is proportional to the eddy s internal shear ( rms vorticity ) , for determining the convective heat and momentum fluxes .",
    "although the two physical pictures give the same result in a static envelope , the results for the fluctuating turbulent fluxes in a pulsating star are very different ( gough 1977a ) .",
    "the main differences between unno s and gough s convection model are summarized in table@xmath381 .",

    "( 2005 ) generalized unno s time - dependent convection model for stability computations of nonradial oscillation modes .",
    "they included in their mean thermal energy equation the viscous dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy , @xmath43 , as an additional heat source .",
    "the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy is introduced in the conservation equation for the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath44 ( e.g. tennekes & lumley 1972,@xmath453.4 ; canuto 1992 ; : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the material derivative , @xmath48 is the average ( oscillation ) velocity , i.e. the total velocity @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the constant kinematic viscosity ( in the limit of high reynolds numbers the molecular transport term can be neglected ) . the first and second term on the right of eq .",

    "this term is also present in the mean thermal energy equation , but with opposite sign .",
    "the linearized perturbed mean thermal energy equation for a star pulsating radially with complex angular frequency @xmath52 can then be written , in the absence of nuclear reactions , as ( ` @xmath39 ' denotes a lagrangian fluctuation and i omit overbars in the mean quantities ) : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the radial mass co - ordinate , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the total ( radiative and convective ) luminosity .",

    "( 2005 ) evaluated @xmath43 from a turbulent kinetic energy equation which was derived without the assumption of the boussinesq approximation .",
    "furthermore it is not obvious whether the dominant buoyancy production term , @xmath57 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tke ] ) , was included in their turbulent kinetic energy equation and so dupret et al .",

    "it demonstrates the near cancellation effect between the contributions of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation , @xmath60 , and turbulent pressure , @xmath42 , making the contribution from the fluctuating convective heat flux , @xmath61 , the dominating damping term .",
    "the near cancellation effect between @xmath60 and @xmath42 was demonstrated first by ledoux & walraven ( 1958 , @xmath6265 ) ( see also gabriel 1996 ) by writing the sum of both work integrals as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the stellar mass , @xmath65 is the enclosed mass at the bottom of the envelope and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is specific entropy ) is the third adiabatic exponent .",
    "except in ionization zones @xmath68 and consequently @xmath69 .",
    "the convection model by xiong ( 1977 , 1989 ) uses transport equations for the second - order moments of the convective fluctuations . in the transport equation for",
    "the turbulent kinetic energy xiong adopts the approximation by hinze ( 1975 ) for the turbulent dissipation rate , i.e. @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the heisenberg eddy coupling coefficient and @xmath72 is the wavenumber of the energy - containing eddies .",
    "however , xiong does not provide a work integral for @xmath43 ( neither does unno et al .",
    "1989 , @xmath6226,30 ) but includes the viscous damping effect of the small - scale turbulence in his model .",
    "the convection models considered here describe only the largest , most energy - containing eddies and ignore the dynamics of the small - scale eddies lying further down the turbulent cascade .",
    "small - scale turbulence does , however , contribute directly to the turbulent fluxes and , under the assumption that they evolve isotropically , they generate an effective viscosity @xmath73 which is felt by a particular pulsation mode as an additional damping effect . the turbulent viscosity can be estimated as ( e.g. gough 1977b ; unno@xmath38et@xmath38al.@xmath381989 , @xmath6220 ) @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a parameter of order unity . the associated work integral @xmath76 can be written in cartesian co - ordinates as ( ledoux & walraven 1958 , @xmath6263 ) @xmath77\\,{\\rm d}m\\ , , \\label{eq : wnu}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the displacement eigenfunction .",

    "[ fig:4 ] for two delta scuti stars : one is located inside the is ( left panel ) , the other outside the cool edge of the is ( right panel ) .",

    "( 2000 ) of radial p modes in the sun , although the authors still found unstable modes with orders between @xmath80 .",
    "the importance of the turbulent damping was reported first by goldreich & keeley ( 1977 ) and later by goldreich & kumar ( 1991 ) , who found all solar modes to be stable only if turbulent damping was included in their stability computations .",
    "in contrast , balmforth ( 1992 ) , who adopted the convection model of gough ( 1977a , b ) , found all solar p modes to be stable due mainly to the damping of the turbulent pressure perturbations , @xmath42 , and reported that viscous damping , @xmath76 , is about one order of magnitude smaller than the contribution of @xmath42 .",
    "turbulent viscosity ( eq .  [ eq : wnu ] ) leads always to mode damping , where as the perturbation of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation , @xmath81 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : peq ] ) , can contribute to both damping and driving of the pulsations ( gabriel 1996 ) .",
