    "universality is an elegant concept and frequently appears in all fields of physics in various forms .",
    "in addition to being important in theoretical physics , the idea of universality can also serve as useful guidelines for experiments .",
    "one well - known example of the usefulness of universality is the critical exponents of second order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "specifically , the numerical values of critical exponents , such as @xmath0 related to the correlation length and @xmath1 associated with the magnetization , do not in principle depend on the microscopic details of the underlying models , but are closely connected to the symmetries of the considered systems .",
    "for example , the zero temperature phase transitions of two - dimensional ( 2d ) dimerized quantum heisenberg models are governed by the @xmath2 universality class @xcite , which is originally resulted from the three - dimensional ( 3d ) classical heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spatial dimerization patterns have no impact on the critical theories of these quantum phase transitions ( however , there may be anomolous corrections to scalings @xcite ) . another noticeable kind ( and example ) of universality is the generally applicable finite - temperature and -volume expressions of several physical quantities of antiferromagnets @xcite . to be more precise , based on the corresponding low - energy effective field theory ,",
    "the theoretical predictions of these observables , such as staggered and uniform susceptibilities , depend solely on a few parameters and have the same forms regardless of the magnitude of the spin of the systems . in conclusion",
    ", universality does play a crucial role in major areas of physics .",
    "recently , the experimental data of the phase diagram of tlcucl@xmath3 under pressure @xcite have triggered many studies both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "in particular , several universal scaling relations are established for 3d quantum antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "specifically , near the quantum phase transitions of clean ( regular ) 3d dimerized spin-1/2 heisenberg models , the nel temperatures @xmath4 scale in several universal manners with the corresponding staggered magnetization density @xmath5 regardless of the dimerization patterns .",
    "in addition , a quantum monte carlo study conducted later demonstrates that these universal scaling relations even remain valid when ( certain kinds of ) quenched bond disorder , i.e. antiferromagnetic bond randomness are introduced into the systems @xcite .",
    "notice the upper critical spatial dimension of the mentioned zero - temperature phase transitions is three .",
    "consequently , close to the critical points one expects to observe multiplicative logarithmic corrections to @xmath4 and @xmath5 when these quantities are considered as functions of the strength of dimerization .",
    "very recently an analytic investigation even argues that the widely believed phase diagram of 3d quantum antiferromagnets is modified dramatically due to these logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "the exponents related to these logarithmic corrections are determined analytically in refs .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical predictions of the numerical values of these new exponents have been verified as well @xcite .",
    "notice that the exponents related to the logarithmic corrections to @xmath4 and @xmath5 take the same values for three spatial dimenions . using this result as well as the fact that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 have the same mean - field values , it is straightforward to show that close the the phase transition , as functions of their corresponding @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are linear in @xmath5 without any logarithmic corrections . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the low - energy constant spinwave velocity and the average of antiferromagnetic couplings , respectively .",
    "these connections between @xmath4 and the associated @xmath5 , namely @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are some constants ) in the vicinity of a quantum critical point are confirmed in ref .  @xcite . in real materials ,",
    "impurities are often present @xcite .",
    "in addition , studies of quenched disorder effects on heisenberg - type models continue to be one of the active research topics in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "therefore one intriguing physics to explore further is that whether the logarithmic corrections , as well as the linear dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath7 on their associated @xmath5 are valid for 3d systems with the presence of antiferromagnetic bond disorder . since such studies of disordered models are relevant to the experimental data of tlcucl@xmath3 , in this investigation we have carried out a large - scale quantum monte carlo simulations of a 3d spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with configurational disorder which is first introduced in ref .",
    "remarkably , our data indicate convincingly that for the studied disordered model , @xmath14 and @xmath15 do depend on their corresponding @xmath16 linearly close to the associated quantum phase transition ( in this study observables with a overline on them refer to the results of disorder average ) .",
    "furthermore , the obtained data of @xmath17 and @xmath16 here can be described well by the expected critical behaviour for regular dimerized models .",
    "this suggests that the related quantum phase transition of the considered disordered system may be governed by the same critical theory as that of its clean analogues .",
    "it should be pointed out that while close to the considered quantum critical point the relations @xmath18 and @xmath19 hold even for the investigated model with the employed disorder , based on the results of current and previous studies , we find that the prefactor @xmath12 and @xmath13 are likely to be model - dependent . surprisingly , when both the data of current study and that of a clean system available in ref .",
    "@xcite are taken into account concurrently , smooth universal curves appear .",
    "this in turn implies that , while in a restricted sense , the investigated scaling relations of 3d spin-1/2 antiferromagnets are indeed universal .",
    "finally , although the prefactor @xmath12 of @xmath20 ( @xmath18 ) is likely not universal , we find the quantity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the considered critical point , obtained in this study matching very well with the corresponding one in ref .",
    "this indicates that with an appropriate normalization , a true universal quantity may still exist .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , in section 2 we define the investigated model as well as the calculated observables .",
    "we then present a detail analysis of our numerical data in section 3 .",
    "in particular , the scaling relation @xmath20 as well as the logarithmic corrections to @xmath4 and @xmath5 are examined carefully . finally in section 4 we conclude our study .    -1.055 cm",
    "the 3d quantum heisenberg model with random antiferromagnetic couplings studied here is given by the hamilton operators @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the antiferromagnetic couplings ( bonds ) connecting nearest neighbor spins @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and @xmath28 is the spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath29 . the bond disorder considered in this investigation is a generalization of the configurational disorder introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and is realized here as follows .",
    "first of all , a given cubical lattice is subdivided into two by two by two cubes .",
    "secondly , the 12 bonds within a cube is classified into three sets of bonds so that each of them is made up of four bonds parallel to a particular coordinate axis .",
    "furthermore , one of the three sets of bonds of every cube is chosen randomly and uniformly .",
    "in particular , these picked bonds are assigned the antiferromagnetic coupling strength @xmath30 .",
    "finally the remaining unchosen bonds as well as those not within any cubes have antiferromagnetic coupling strength @xmath31 which is set to be @xmath32 in this investigation .",

    "although based on our investigation we conclude that the coefficient @xmath12 is likely not universal , we find the quantity @xmath21 determined in this investigation matching very well with the corresponding result in @xcite . specifically , using the data available in ref .  @xcite and here , we reach @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the double cubic model and the disordered model studied here , respectively",
    ". notice the numerical values of @xmath21 obtained from two different models are in very good agreement with each other . while our preliminary result of @xmath21 of other dimerized model does not seem to support the scenario that the quantity @xmath21 takes a universal value , the investigation carried out in this study suggests true universal quantities may still emerge for both the clean and disordered 3d antiferromagnets ( which share some similar properties ) . to uncover the possible hidden universal relations of 3d antiferromagnets",

    "<S> the nel temperature , staggered magnetization density , as well as the spinwave velocity of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic disorder ( randomness ) are calculated using first principles non - perturbative quantum monte carlo simulations . </S>",

    "<S> remarkably , our numerical results show that the considered scaling relations remain true for the investigated model with the introduced disorder . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , while the presence of disorder may change the physical properties of regular dimerized models , hence leading to different critical theories , both the obtained data of nel temperature and staggered magnetization density in our study are fully compatible with the expected critical behaviour for clean dimerized systems . as a result , it is persuasive to conclude that the related quantum phase transitions of the considered disordered model and its clean analogues are governed by the same critical theory , which is not always the case in general . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also find smooth scaling curves even emerging when both the data of the investigated disordered model as well as its associated clean system are taken into account concurrently . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn implies that , while in a restricted sense , the considered scaling relations for 3d spin-1/2 antiferromagnets are indeed universal . </S>"
