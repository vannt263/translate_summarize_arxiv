    "beginning with max planck discoveries [ 1 ] , one of the fundamental issues in optics , electrodynamics , thermodynamics , atomic physics and quantum mechanics , is how a radiation , in particular blackbody radiation , imposes an equilibrium in the material system by either heating it up or cooling down .",
    "this process is facilitated by a so called light pressure [ 2 - 4 ] on charged particles [ 5 ] , most of all the lightest ones  electrons , either ( quasi)free as in plasma , of bound as in atoms or ions , in which case the electrons pass the light pressure on to atoms .",
    "the advent of lasers allowed the development of highly controlled and engineered non - thermal radiation environment , such as coherent laser light with its frequency tuned near atomic resonances , and use them for the cooling of atoms by red - shifted laser [ 6 - 9 ] ( and coherent motional excitation of atoms by blue - shifted one [ 10,11 ] ) .",
    "a related ponderomotive , or field - gradient force [ 12 - 14 ] , manifested e. g. @xmath0 kapitza - dirac effect [ 15 - 18 ] , has also been used in laser trapping of atoms [ 6 - 9 ] and macro - particles [ 19 ] , high - field ionization of atoms [ 19 - 21 ] , etc .",
    "it can be very sensitive to relativistic effects , which under certain conditions may result in a chaotic motion [ 22,23 ] or even reverse the sign of that force in a strong field [ 24,25 ] .",
    "in the case of blackbody radiation acting upon free electrons , the situation is rather straightforward and fundamental : non - resonant light pressure plays the role of the equilibrium `` enforcer '' by either energizing slow electrons or damping the fast ones .",
    "the main issue here is how fast the equilibrium / thermalization can be reached .",
    "the relaxation time , @xmath1 , of that process could vary by many orders of magnitude depending of the temperature @xmath2 and initial energy / momentum of electrons ; in classical domain @xmath3 . at the temperatures near absolute zero ( e. g. in the so called relic radiations , or cosmic microwave background , cmb [ 26 - 28 ] )",
    "the equilibrium is essentially unreachable ( it is too long even at @xmath4 , see below ) , whereas in high-@xmath2 environments , e. g. controlled nuclear fusion , nuclear explosions , and star cores , it can be reached faster than in attoseconds .",
    "we found that the nature of transition to equilibrium is controlled by a parameter called by us `` compton factor '' , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a relativistic factor of electrons , @xmath7 is a normalized temperature , @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath9  the rest energy of electron , and @xmath10 , see below .",
    "when @xmath11 , we are dealing with a so called thompson , or classical , scattering of light , whereby the scattering cross - section , @xmath12 is constant , even if @xmath13 , and the theory of light pressure is well known , see e. g. [ 5 ] . due to advents in laser and controlled fusion technologies , the @xmath14 can be large enough , @xmath15 , and we are entering a qed , or compton domain , where the respective theory is far less developed .",
    "in view of new developments in nuclear fusion and physics in general , e. g. in astrophysics and cosmology [ 29 - 31 ] , it would be of fundamental importance to have the theory of that force over all the energies of electrons and temperatures of radiation , from the classical , @xmath11 , to transient , @xmath16 , to qed domains , @xmath17 . from qm viewpoint [ 32,33 ] ,",
    "the light pressure on elementary particles is a result of averaging over ensemble of inverse compton scattering events [ 34 - 36 ] , whereby a particle transfers part of its momentum to a scattered photon .",
    "the known results provide patchy descriptions of the process , with quantitative results known mostly for `` cold '' case [ 5 ] , and qualitative  for very `` hot '' case in the theory of high - energy cosmic rays [ 36 - 38 ] . yet , to the best of our knowledge , no general formula for the light pressure @xmath18 and related relaxation rates for arbitrary @xmath14 presently exists .    in this paper ,    \\(a ) by using lorentz transformation of spectrum , sect .",
    "ii , and relating photon scattering to momentum transfer to electrons @xmath0 doppler and compton relationships , sect .",
    "iii , we derived a general light pressure formula , sect .",
    "iv , for the isotropic / uniform radiation with an @xmath19 frequency spectrum , @xmath20 relativistic energy of electrons and @xmath21 spectral dependence of the the scattering cross - section on frequency of light ,    \\(b ) checked it out for the well known case of thompson scattering and related light pressure , sect .",
    "v , and simplified it in the case of blackbody radiation with planks spectrum at @xmath19 temperature , sect .",
    "vi ;    \\(c ) by using the frequency / energy dependence of photon - electron scattering cross - section in the compton , or qed domain , based on the klein - nishina qed theory [ 39,40 ] which takes into consideration virtual electron - positron pair creation and annihilation , sect .",
    "vii , we applied a general formula to the case of electron , immersed in the blackbody radiation , and found amazingly precise and universal analytic approximation for the light force in the entire domain , sect .",
    "viii , and finally    \\(d ) considered kinetics of electron density distribution to the equilibrium , i. e. the thermalization of the distribution , using fokker - planck equation and its solutions , in particular relaxation rates of the process , and how they may affect plasma oscillations , sect .",
    "our results may have important applications for both high - temperature plasma , in particular controlled nuclear fusion and nuclear explosions , and to astrophysics / cosmology ( to be addressed by us elsewhere [ 41 ] ) .",
    "an isotropic ( and homogeneous ) radiation is associated with some preferred @xmath22-frame , where a particle at rest experiences no time averaged light pressure , as the action of a @xmath23-vector component is canceled by a counter - propagating ( @xmath24 ) component .",

    "a general formula for a lorentz transformation of a distribution function @xmath53 in the @xmath22-frame to a distribution function @xmath54 in a @xmath29-frame moving uniformly with respect to the @xmath22-frame is as [ 42,43 ] : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are related to @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively by a standard lorentz transform for an observer moving in @xmath22-frame in the @xmath26-axis with velocity @xmath60 . in the case of photon gas eq .",

    "those many - body excitations seem to preclude a single - electron light pressure , eq .",
    "( 31 ) , from playing a significant role in plasma relaxation .",
    "however , the relaxation time @xmath1 due to light pressure does become a major player as long as it gets faster than relaxation in other channels of thermalization such as collision with similar or other species ( e. g. electrons and protons ) , @xmath366 , to dominate in a total relaxation rate @xmath367 if @xmath368 , hence @xmath369 .",

    "resulting evolution of the spectra of high-@xmath2 sources in the relict radiation environment reveals their drastic transformation , e. g. formation of narrow spectral lines in the cosmic electron spectrum , and development of a `` frozen non - equilibrium '' state due to very low rate of electron momentum decay in the thompson domain .",
    "the ramifications of these effects in astrophysics and cosmology will be discussed by us elsewhere [ 41 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we developed a theory for the light pressure on particles , in particular electrons , by isotropic radiation , in particular blackbody / planck radiation , that covers the entire span of energies / momenta up to the planck energy by using , in the case of electron , the qed klein - nishina theory for electron - photon cross - section scattering .",
