    "the archetype h rich white dwarf , g191-b2b ( wd0501 + 527 ) , has long been used both as a photometric standard due to its apparent brightness , and also as a spectroscopic `` gold standard '' when analysing other hot da stars .",
    "this object has also been used as a flux standard at almost all wavelengths , beginning with the work of @xcite to the absolute _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "flux scale of @xcite . in table",
    "[ table : factfile ] , we list the basic stellar parameters of g191-b2b , where the mass , absolute magnitude ( @xmath2 ) and cooling time ( @xmath3 ) have been determined using the photometric tables of @xcitebergeron / coolingmodels ] ( hereafter the montreal photometric tables ) .",
    "the designation g191-b2b originates from the giclas lowell proper motion survey . while not formally identified as a white dwarf , @xcite did identify it as being degenerate in nature , assigning it the spectral classification dawk , and also designating it as a possible subdwarf .",
    "it was also listed by @xcite as a common proper motion pair with the k star g191-b2a , located 84 \" to the north .",
    "such a proper motion pairing is now considered erroneous , as _ hipparcos _ has shown the two stars to have distinctly different proper motions .",
    "g191-b2b is therefore an isolated star and efforts to determine a gravitational radial velocity from both stars ( @xcite and @xcite ) are moot .",
    "a seminal high dispersion uv observation of g191-b2b by @xcite , using the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ) , revealed the surprising discovery of many highly ionised features such as c iv , n v , and si iv in a star that was thought to possess a pure h spectrum .",
    "the detection of such absorption features led to extensive studies of other white dwarf stars .",
    "a decade later , the first detections of an ionised heavy metal , fe v , were made by @xcite in the photospheric spectrum of g191-b2b using the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph .",
    "this led to searches for additional heavy metals in white dwarf spectra , with the next fe group metal , ni , being discovered in g191-b2b and rej2214 - 492 by @xcite , and feige 24 and rej0623 - 377 by @xcite , using co - added _ iue _ high dispersion spectra .",
    "further spectroscopic surveys were conducted , with yet more new heavy metals being discovered by @xcite , who made detections of the resonant transitions of p v and s vi in orfeus spectra .",
    "a later survey by @xcite used a spectrum from the _ hst _ , and discovered the presence of an additional component in the resonant lines of c iv 1548.203 and 1550.777 ( hereafter c iv 1548 and 1550 respectively ) , that could not be attributed to either the photosphere of g191-b2b , or to the ism .",
    "this feature was thought to be interstellar or `` circumstellar '' by @xcite , who in their survey of g191-b2b , showed that this feature was separated from the photospheric velocity by  15 km / s .",
    "this circumstellar material was not unique to g191-b2b , and similar high ionisation features were found in seven other da white dwarfs by @xcite , corroborated by @xcite .",
    "the heaviest metal detected in a da white dwarf thus far was found by @xcite , who made detections of resonant absorption features of ge iv .",
    "the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) , and the _ joint astrophysical plasma - dynamic experiment _ ( _ j - pex _ ) @xcite have observed g191-b2b extensively , covering 70 - 770 and 170 - 290 respectively .",
    "_ euve _ observations of the star showed that the predicted flux far exceeded that observed @xcite , meaning that model atmospheres for some effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) , gravity ( log @xmath5 ) , and composition could not simultaneously match the euv , uv , and optical spectra .",
    "this was accomplished by @xcite , who showed that including additional opacity in model atmosphere calculations reduced the predicted flux to the correct level . however , this came at the cost of including additional he ii opacity in the photosphere in order to maintain good agreement below the he ii lyman limit .",
    "an alternative was explored by @xcite , whereby they invoked a stratified h+he and homogeneous heavy metal atmosphere . while the model could also reproduce the euv spectrum ,",
    "it predicted he ii absorption features that descended far deeper than that observed .",
    "a substantial piece of work was done by @xcite , who performed self consistent calculations including the effects of radiative levitation and gravitation settling for g191-b2b . by depleting the fe and ni abundance at the surface and having it increase at greater depths",
    ", they were able to reproduce the euv spectrum without including other sources of opacity , mass loss , or accretion .",
    "a similar atmospheric configuration was used by @xcite , who stratified fe , with increasing abundance with greater depth .",
    "they showed that this stratified configuration was preferred statistically over a homogeneous fe distribution .",
    "observations with _",
    "j - pex _ yielded further discoveries in the euv spectrum of g191-b2b .",
    "@xcite performed a spectroscopic analysis of the star using _ j - pex _ data , and made detections of the he ii lyman series",
    ". this would be significant if it was found to be interstellar , as this would imply an unusual ionization fraction .",
    "it was also proposed that this he may be associated with the additional absorption component observed in the c iv doublet , discussed by @xcite and @xcite . a further spectroscopic survey using _ j - pex _ was conducted by @xcite .",
    "they found that by splitting the he ii features into two components , one for the local interstellar cloud , and the other as another interstellar feature , the he ionisation fraction agreed with values obtained from other lines of sight .",
    "observations of the h lyman / balmer line series of a white dwarf also allows information on its physical parameters to be inferred .",
    "pioneered by @xcite , a grid of theoretical spectra with differing values of @xmath4 and log @xmath5 can be used to fit either the h lyman or balmer absorption profiles to that of an observed spectrum , as such profiles are very sensitive to changes in these parameters . such a method",
    ", however , appears to have limitations for white dwarfs whose @xmath640,000k . dubbed the `` lyman - balmer line problem '' , measurements of @xmath4 made in da white dwarfs using either the lyman or balmer line series yield differing values , some by a few 1,000k , and some even by 10,000k , getting larger for increasing values of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "no similar appreciable effect is seen on the measurement of log @xmath5 . a similar",
    ", more severe effect is seen in dao stars @xcite .",
    "a study by @xcite considered many different causes of this problem , ranging from atmospheric composition to unresolved binaries .",
    "one such cause was concluded to be due to some form of wavelength dependent extinction , however , the exact relation between the two was left open to debate .",
    "it was also suggested that atmospheric composition may play a part in causing the discrepancy , but results were inconclusive .",
    "it is not unreasonable to consider such an idea , however , as metal line blanketing dramatically effects a hot da sed . @xcite",
    "have shown that using a model grid with a pure h atmosphere and a grid with a line blanketed heavy metal atmosphere yield @xmath4 measurements again differing by 1000s of k.    @xcite also considered the lyman - balmer line problem , postulating that the temperature discrepancy may be due to inadequacies in the input atomic physics in generating the model atmospheres . using g191-b2b and rej2214 - 492 , they calculated two model grids with varying @xmath4 and log @xmath5 , but with 0.1 and 10 times the nominal abundances of these stars .",
    "they then measured @xmath4 and log @xmath5 using the lyman and balmer line series , finding that while the temperature difference decreased by 20 - 30% , a statistically significant discrepancy still remained .",
    "an accurate knowledge of a star s photospheric composition is , therefore , paramount in accurately constraining @xmath4 and log @xmath5 in model atmosphere calculations .",
    "determination of these parameters can provide useful insights into the white dwarf s origin and evolution .",
    "for example , the cooling time of a degenerate object has a one to one correspondence with @xmath4 , and hence gives a monotonic cooling age .",
    "knowledge of log @xmath5 yields information on the mass of the white dwarf , and along with evolutionary models such as those from @xcite or the montreal photometric tables , an estimate of the radius of the star .",
    "calculations by @xcite for various values of @xmath4 and log @xmath5 describe the predicted variation of metal abundances due to radiative levitation .",
    "however , the observational results do not agree very well with the predictions . in the case of g191-b2b for example , @xcite reported the fe and ni abundances to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , differing roughly by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , @xcite predict that these abundances should share a similar value .",
    "this disagreement is also present in other white dwarfs in the sample of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that @xcite reported significant differences in predicted atmospheric abundances of fe and ni dependent on the number of transitions included in their calculations .",
    "it is this variation in results that suggests that poor agreement between theory and observation may be dependent on the number of opacities included in these calculations ."
