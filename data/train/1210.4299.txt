    "in the nearby universe , most stars reside in massive , passively evolving spheroidal systems , either spiral bulges or elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "early - type galaxies ( etg ) , such as ellipticals and lenticulars , are often the most massive galaxies in their surrounding environment and etgs include the dominant stellar component in clusters of galaxies . as far as they can be found in significant numbers , massive etgs exhibit very homogeneous spectrophotometric properties , requiring that their stellar content formed rapidly at relatively high redshifts and evolved passively for most of the cosmic time . in particular , studies of the core etg population in galaxy clusters suggest that the quenching of their star formation ( sf ) was already underway by @xmath9 .",
    "the precursors of @xmath10 massive elliptical galaxies can arguably be found in some high - redshift submillimeter - selected galaxies , whose extreme star - formation rates ( sfrs , in excess of @xmath11  m@xmath12  yr@xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imply that they should exhaust their gas reservoirs on short time scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus offer a striking example of rapid , unsustainable growth at early epochs .",
    "the spheroidal morphology of etgs might then be either the consequence of merging events , triggering the starburst or happening after the quenching of sf , or dynamical instabilities internal to the galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this latter process may actually be the dominant one , given that the vast majority ( @xmath14 ) of etgs are fast rotators @xcite .",
    "+ one would therefore expect to find quenched , massive etgs already at @xmath15 and indeed passively evolving galaxies ( pegs ; generally color selected as passive and not necessarily morphologically early - type ) have been spectroscopically confirmed up to @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "most of these early passive systems appear to be up to a factor @xmath17 denser than their modern counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the search for high - redshift etgs is hampered not only by the expected rarity of such objects , but also by the intrinsic difficulty in reliably detecting them and measuring their redshifts .",
    "the most distinctive spectral feature of etgs , the pronounced metal break at 4000   is redshifted to the near - infrared at @xmath18 and detection , let alone characterization , of @xmath19 etgs requires good continuum signal to noise ( s / n ) only achievable with extremely long exposures from the ground .",
    "consequently , the sample of confirmed @xmath20 etgs is still small , and its high - redshift tail , i.e. , the earliest epoch at which passive galaxies can be found , poorly constrained .",
    "+         here we present the serendipitous discovery of the most distant spectroscopic etg so far identified , i.e. , a massive and passive galaxy at @xmath9 . throughout the letter",
    ", we assume a @xmath21cdm cosmology with @xmath22  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab photometric system .",
    "this object ( hereafter rs-235 ) was discovered in deep _ hst_/wfc3 observations of the @xmath25 cluster cl j1449 + 0856 @xcite at 14:49:16.5 , + 8:55:34.7 , about 56  from the center of the structure .",
    "these data cover a 6.4  arcmin@xmath26 field centered on cl j1449 + 0856 and consist of 2 orbits of imaging with the @xmath27 filter and 16 orbits of spectroscopy with the g141 grism , in three different orientations .",
    "the individual frames were sky - subtracted and reduced using the best available calibration files .",
    "standard procedures were applied : the wfc3 images were combined with multidrizzle and grism spectra for each orientation extracted with the axe pipeline @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 image of rs-235 , as well as the two - dimensional spectra in the three orientations , is shown in figure [ fig:2d].trace contamination was modeled using the @xmath27 deep image ( @xmath28  ab at 5@xmath29 in a 1   aperture ) and the multiwavelength dataset already available for this field .",
    "this extensive set of ground - based observations was first described in @xcite and has recently been extended with deep @xmath30 and @xmath31-band vlt / fors2 imaging and deeper 3.5 - 4.5  _ spitzer_/irac imaging , in addition to the _ hst_/wfc3 data . at longer wavelengths , 24   _",
    "spitzer_/mips data were already available and _ herschel_/pacs 100 and 160  observations have recently been obtained to expand the dataset ( the maps reach a 5@xmath29 depth of 1.5 and 2.8  mjy respectively and will be described in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "we have used this new multiwavelength ( @xmath30-band to irac ) catalog to compute photometric redshifts for all objects in the _ hst_/wfc3 field with eazy using the standard set of templates @xcite .",
    "+ rs-235 stood out in this dataset as having a 2d spectrum with a pronounced break at @xmath32 m , a well - constrained photometric redshift of @xmath9 and rest - frame @xmath33 colors consistent with an old stellar population @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rs-235 is not seen at 24 , 100 or 160  although , due to its redshift and the depth of the maps , this non - detection only provides very loose constraints on its sfr , with an upper limit of sfr@xmath34  @xmath4  yr@xmath13 assuming recent templates from @xcite .    to ensure that the spectrum of rs-235 is free of contamination so that its continuum shape can be measured reliably , we performed , for each of the three wfc3 orientations , two different extractions from the cutout produced by axe .",
    "we first used a 3  pixel aperture , roughly corresponding to the fwhm of the object , and linearly fitted the observed spectrum with the combined contamination and trace models .",
    "we compared the resulting one - dimensional spectrum with that obtained from fitting each cross - dispersion column of the cutout with profiles derived , for each trace , from the profile of the corresponding object in the @xmath27 image .",
    "the decontaminated spectra were then stacked to produce a single high s / n ( @xmath35 pixel@xmath13 at 1.6 @xmath36 m ) spectrum and converted to flux units .",
    "we note that , while the first orientation suffers from moderate contamination between 1.25 and 1.5 @xmath36 m ( from the tail of a bright non overlapping trace ) and the other two below 1.25  @xmath36 m ( from overlapping traces ) , the region redward of 1.5 @xmath36 m where the break is seen is entirely free from contamination in all three cases .",
    "the sampling of the spectrum is 46.5    with the g141 grism and its fwhm resolution 126   , as grism spectra are convolved with the brightness profile of the dispersed sources . in this case",
    ", the profile is sufficiently circular ( @xmath37 ) that it was not necessary to optimize the orientation of the pseudo - slit during extraction .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sedfit ] , the stacked spectrum shows two distinct spectral features : the break at 1.6  @xmath36 m and an absorption feature ( h@xmath38 ) at 1.636  @xmath36 m . their position suggests a redshift of @xmath39 , which was measured by comparison with templates ( see below ) , yielding @xmath40 .",
    "as its spectrophotometry precludes dusty sf solutions ( see below ) , this makes rs-235 the most distant peg confirmed so far .      to estimate the stellar mass and characterize the stellar population of the galaxy , we compared both the combined 15-band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and high s / n part ( 1.41.65  @xmath36 m ) of the stacked grism spectrum to a range of stellar population models .",
    "these were built using high resolution @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter bc03 and m05 ) single stellar population templates , assuming @xmath41 ( see below ) , a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we considered two different sets of star formation histories ( sfh ) : a delayed , exponentially declining sfh with characteristic time scale @xmath42 between 1  myr and 2  gyr and ages from 100  myr to the age of the universe at @xmath7 , and a rising exponential sfh of the form sfr@xmath43 , starting at @xmath44 .",
    "the first one can be considered a versatile , albeit simplistic , `` generic '' sfh , while the second scenario is meant to put lower limits to the average sfr and formation time scales required to produce a galaxy such as rs-235 .",
    "it is appropriate for a galaxy on the `` main sequence '' ( ms ) of star forming galaxies and relies on the apparent weak evolution of the specific sfr ( ssfr ) at @xmath45 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indeed implies an exponential growth .",
    "its two parameters are the initial mass @xmath46 of the galaxy at the beginning of ms evolution ,  and the parameter @xmath47 setting the time scale and determined by the normalization of the sfr-@xmath48 relation at @xmath16 . a shallower slope of the sfr-@xmath48 relation , e.g. ,",
    "a slope @xmath49 found by @xcite , would imply a power - law sfh with sfr@xmath50 , whereas the exponential form has a simpler dependence on @xmath46 .",
    "we allowed values up to 0.7  dex below and above the ms .    in both cases we allowed for a",
    "sf cut - off at an arbitrary time to be determined by the best fit procedure , with an option for a secondary burst after the initial quenching contributing up to 50% of the final mass .",
    "this addition is motivated by the detection of the galaxy in the rest - frame far - uv ( the @xmath31 band , as shown in figure [ fig : sedfit ] ) implying the presence of a small amount of massive stars .",
    "note that the detection in @xmath51 is marginal , at @xmath52 , and might be due to contamination from a nearby source .",
    "dust extinction was also added using a @xcite extinction law and recombination lines were computed using gaussian profiles of matching resolution , assuming the sfr-@xmath53 calibration of @xcite and standard line ratios @xcite .",
    "the model spectra were convolved with the filters responses to produce synthetic seds , smoothed to the resolution of the grism spectrum using a gaussian kernel and rebinned to match the observed spectrum .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in figure [ fig : sedfit ] and in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "+ due to the low resolution of the grism spectrum , the spectral fit is mainly constrained by the shape of the continuum , namely the break at @xmath541.6 @xmath36 m and the blueward slope of the spectrum , and the lack of prominent spectral features .",
    "notably , the spectrum does not show any [ oii]3727 emission .",
    "we find a mean stellar age of @xmath55  gyr ( corresponding to @xmath56 ) , with a last episode of sf contributing less than 10% of the final mass of @xmath57  @xmath4 .",
    "for the delayed exponential sfh , the fit yields time scales of @xmath58  myr . in the exponential sfh case , solutions with ssfr below the fiducial ms value ( @xmath59  gyr@xmath13 at @xmath60  @xmath4 , using @xcite ) require apparently unrealistic seed masses of @xmath61  @xmath4 at @xmath62 ( see e.g. , m. sargent et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in this case",
    ", the fit implies doubling time - scales of 220  myr or less .",
    "the amount of extinction compatible with the sed is small , @xmath63 , and the fit accordingly rules out star - forming solutions , yielding a negligible residual sfr of @xmath64  @xmath4  yr@xmath13 .",
    "rs-235 thus appears to have ssfr of less than @xmath65  gyr@xmath13 , at least 2.7  dex below the ms of star forming galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , models based on @xcite templates provide a less good fit to the rest - frame optical - nir sed , underpredicting the flux in the observed @xmath66 band ( rest - frame 50006000   ) . as rs-235 is still a young stellar population",
    ", this could be due to , e.g. , the effect of thermally pulsing - asymptotic giant branch stars in the m05 models ( which would produce a shallower rayleigh - jeans slope ) or the presence of convective overshooting in the stellar tracks used by the bc03 models @xcite .",
    "+    ccccccc @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 +      interestingly , solar metallicity models are rejected at @xmath74 by the stellar population modeling .",
    "quantifying the strength of the 4000    break using the d@xmath754000 index @xcite , we find d@xmath76 ( where uncertainties were estimated through monte carlo simulations based on the error spectrum ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : met ] , this value is comparable to that of a maximally old ( @xmath77 ssp ) @xmath78 stellar population , implying that this is a lower limit to the metallicity of rs-235 and suggesting that the strength of the break requires not only a passive stellar population but also a stellar metallicity above the solar value .",
    "we note that the significantly worse resolution of the _",
    "g141 spectra , compared to that of the slit spectra of lower redshift objects , on which the d@xmath754000 index is usually measured , can affect the apparent strength of the break .",
    "while this effect depends on the stellar population mix and is most pronounced in the case of ssps , we find that at our effective resolution the correction is negligible for the best fitting template to the spectrum .",

    "we measured its morphological properties by fitting the surface brightness profile with a srsic model @xcite using galfit 3 @xcite .",
    "we constructed a median point - spread function by combining six unsaturated , high s / n stars in our _ hst_/wfc3 field .",
    "rs-235 is relatively isolated , with the nearest sources being at least 2.3 away and 1.5  mag fainter .",
    "the morphological analysis is therefore stable whether we include the closest neighbors or not . from a series of galfit simulations we find that the bias on structural parameters is negligible for a 24  mag object like this galaxy .",
    "the scatter on @xmath80 and @xmath81 is about 10% and 20% respectively , which we adopt as the standard error on the parameters .",
    "accordingly , the srsic fit yields a circularized effective radius of @xmath820.02 , or @xmath83  kpc at @xmath0 , and a srsic index of @xmath84 . in figure",
    "[ fig : d4k ] we compare structural and stellar population parameters of rs-235 with samples of pegs in the field at @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "+ we note that we can not _ a priori _ discount the possibility that rs-235 be lensed by the cluster cl j1449 + 0856 , as it is relatively close to it , and its observable properties ( mass and size ) therefore affected . to estimate this effect",
    ", we assumed a simple lens model with a single halo of mass @xmath86  @xmath4 ( conservatively twice the x - ray mass , to account for the fact that the structure is likely not entirely virialized ) at @xmath19 , centered on the x - ray emission ( see * ? ? ? * ) . considering both singular isothermal or @xcite profiles with @xmath87",
    ", we derive a magnification of less than 3% , almost a factor 10 lower than the uncertainties on either mass or size and thus negligible .",
    "we similarly estimate that the closest projected neighbors of rs-235 do not generate any appreciable lensing effect . on the other hand",
    ", we find a magnification of up to 7% for a relatively bright spiral galaxy at 5.2 and @xmath88 , implying that the stellar mass could be overestimated by this much and the size by @xmath59% .",
    "although these factors are lower than the systematic error on either parameter , we added 7% and 3% to the lower uncertainties on the mass and circularized effective radius , respectively , to take the effect of magnification into account .",
    "rs-235 appears to be a quenched , if not entirely passive galaxy at @xmath0 , the most distant spectroscopically confirmed so far .",
    "its spectrophotometric properties suggest that this galaxy formed the bulk of its stars relatively quickly at @xmath89 and already has a high metallicity , comparable to that of local etgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with @xmath90",
    ", it has a flatter profile than the typical passive population at lower redshifts and appears to have not acquired yet a characteristic etg morphology . as with the vast majority of @xmath91 pegs , it is also more compact ( 23 times below the local mass - size relation for etgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than present - day etgs , although apparently less so than other @xmath5 passive galaxies of similar mass and rather well within the variation of @xmath6 galaxies shown in figure [ fig : d4k ] .",
    "we note that our size measurement was made on a rest - frame near - uv ( 350  nm ) image , as were the measurements by @xcite , while @xcite used rest - frame optical ( 480  nm ) data .",
    "based on the stellar population modeling , we estimate that the flux contribution of young ( @xmath92  myr ) stars increases only by 10%30% from 480 to 350  nm , thus , this younger component , if present , should not affect much the effective radius measurement .",
    "as , additionally , the morphology of high - redshift etgs has not been observed to vary significantly between the rest - frame near - uv and optical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is unlikely that the somewhat lower surface density of rs-235 compared to the @xcite sample could be due to a positive age gradient . on the other hand ,",
    "the population of pegs at @xmath8 has been found to be diverse in terms of structural properties with some early - types having a size comparable to that of local etgs @xcite .",
    "the existence of a @xmath7 passive galaxy , very close to its formation epoch , as extended as the @xmath6 population reinforces this picture and suggests that the diversity of @xmath93 etgs could reflect not only a spread in assembly histories but also the existence of different formation pathways for these early etgs .",
    "+ for example , the compactness of high - redshift etgs is expected to depend on whether they were produced through gas - rich or gas - poor mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or through secular gas exhaustion .",
    "however , the available data do not allow us to favor a particular formation scenario , although the relatively low srsic index is not indicative of a recent ( major ) merger .",
    "on the other hand , the spectrophotometric fit tends to favor solutions with short doubling time scales and accelerated evolution at high redshift , with respect to our fiducial ms .",
    "+ finally , as shown in figure [ fig : d4k ] , there are five non - disky pegs in the @xcite sample with d@xmath754000 equal or higher than that of rs-235 at the same epoch , assuming passive evolution of the best fit models .",
    "these galaxies are likely to be at least as old as rs-235 and to have been already quenched at @xmath9 .",
    "their surface density , @xmath94  arcmin@xmath95 , is compatible with our single detection in a 6.4  arcmin@xmath26 field , suggesting that they and rs-235 come from the same early peg population .",
    "it also implies that confirmation of further @xmath9 pegs would require relatively few appropriately deep wfc3 pointings and should thus be quite feasible , although the response of the g141 grism will limit the identification of the 4000    break to @xmath96 until newer instruments , such as nirspec on the _ james webb space telescope _",
