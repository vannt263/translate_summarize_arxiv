    "the celebrated fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model was introduced fifty years ago in order to study the process of equilibration of energy among normal modes due to mode - mode interactions @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a toy version of a model describing the dynamics of lattice vibrations of perfect crystals .",
    "the original fpu model reduced space dimension to one , and attributed one degree of freedom to each lattice site .",
    "it is worth to mention that in the absence of mode - mode interactions , that model is often used in solid state physics textbooks to explain the basic features of phonons and is then called a _ monoatomic chain _ @xcite .",
    "some of these textbooks deal also with mode - mode interactions , coining them _ anharmonic corrections _",
    "( since they appear as anharmonic terms in the taylor expansion of the potential energy of the lattice with respect to atomic displacements ) .",
    "notably these anharmonic terms are used to explain thermal expansion of crystals , among many other features .",
    "it is also worth to stress that solid state physicists did not seriously question the assumed fact that in thermal equilibrium the energy _ is _",
    "equipartitioned among the normal modes - due to the bulk of accumulated experimental evidence for that fact",
    ". the more time - resolved spectroscopical methods advance , the more questions arise concerning these topics when studying lattice dynamics in the presence of strong nonlinearities ( i.e. mode - mode interactions ) . returning to the fpu model calculations , they revealed the surprising fact that at least for some cases ( for some sets of initial conditions ) the evolution of the fpu model showed _ no _ equipartioning among the normal modes @xcite . in other words , the fpu _ paradox _ seems to consist primarily of the observation of _ localization _ of energy in a few normal modes , despite the presence of interaction between all modes , which would be capable of distributing the energy among all normal modes of the system @xcite .",
    "+    while the modern view on this fpu paradox observation is for sure discussed in other contributions to this focus issue , we will not dwell on that further . in what follows",
    ", we will discuss another interesting aspect of the dynamics in the fpu model and its various generalizations .",
    "this concerns localization in _",
    "real space_. in other words , we will show that fpu models allow for solutions of the corresponding equations where the energy is not equally shared among the _ local _ constituents ( using the solid state physics language , among the different atoms ) .",
    "these solutions are coined _ intrinsic localized modes _",
    "( ilm ) , or _ discrete breathers _",
    "whatever the nomenclature , ilms / dbs turn out to be generic to a much larger class of _ hamiltonian lattices _ , and fpu models together with their generalizations represent one of the subclasses of these lattices ( see fig.[figbreather_types ] for a schematic representation of various dbs ) .",
    "ilms / dbs are time - periodic and spatially localized solutions , and exist thanks to the interplay between nonlinearity and discreteness @xcite .",
    "many studies of dbs have been successfully launched , on such topics as rigorous existence proofs , dynamical and structural stability and computational methods of obtaining dbs in classical models as well as their quantum aspects .",
    "in addition dbs have been detected and studied experimentally in such different systems as interacting josephson junction systems @xcite , coupled nonlinear optical waveguides @xcite , lattice vibrations in crystals @xcite , antiferromagnetic structures @xcite , micromechanical cantilever arrays @xcite , bose - einstein condensates loaded on optical lattices @xcite , layered high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite .",
    "dbs are predicted also to exist in the dynamics of dusty plasma crystals @xcite .",
    "it is an equally interesting question of why ilms / dbs have not been properly discussed when studying the lattice dynamics of crystals until very recently .",
    "we leave the answer to this question to the experienced and educated experts of that field .",
    "we will consider the following class of one - dimensional hamiltonian chains @xmath2 \\ ; , \\label{1 - 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 describes the scalar displacement of a particle ( atom ) from its equilibrium position , @xmath4 is its conjugated momentum ( velocity ) , @xmath5 denotes the number of the particle , and @xmath6 is the interaction potential between nearest neighbours .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 is assumed to take only nonnegative values for small values of the displacements and velocities , i.e. the potential @xmath8 and its first derivative @xmath9 vanish for zero displacements @xmath10 and the second derivative @xmath11 is positive for small displacements @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian equations of motions @xmath13 lead to the following set of coupled differential equations : @xmath14 let us expand the function @xmath8 in the following series @xmath15 if the potential @xmath6 is symmetric @xmath16 it follows @xmath17 for all positive integers @xmath18 .",
    "the celebrated fpu models @xcite are obtained by choosing nonzero values for @xmath19 and zeroing all the others @xmath20 .",
    "thus we may consider the fpu models as low amplitude expansions of the more general model class ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "fpu models take into account the two first anharmonic corrections @xmath21 to the harmonic term @xmath22 .",
    "the case of a symmetric potential for fpu models is thus obtained by assuming @xmath23 .",
    "note that anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian correspond to nonlinear terms in the equations of motion here .",
    "the equations ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) conserve both the total energy @xmath7 ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) as well as the _ total mechanical momentum _ @xmath24 . without loss of generality we will consider below the case @xmath25 only .",
    "if we restrict our consideration to very small amplitudes and velocities only , we may neglect all nonlinear terms from the equations of motion , assuming @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of the corresponding _ linear _ coupled differential equations @xmath27 can be written in the form of a superposition of plane waves each given by @xmath28 where @xmath0 is the wave number , @xmath29 the plane wave frequency , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are integration constants . the dispersion relation ( fig.[fig1 ] ) @xmath32 is periodic in @xmath0 and is characterized by an upper bound @xmath33 .",
    "on @xmath0 for @xmath34 .",
    "vertical and horizontal lines mark the values @xmath35 and @xmath36.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    moreover for small values of @xmath0 @xmath37 .",
    "such an _ acoustic _ type of dispersion at small values of @xmath0 is intimately connected to the above mentioned conservation of the total mechanical momentum @xmath38 .",
    "any spatially localized initial excitation on the lattice will ultimately disperse due to the @xmath0-dependence of the _ group velocity _",
    "@xmath39 taking into account weak anharmonic / nonlinear effects usually leads to a renormalization of plane wave properties such as frequencies and lifetimes .",
    "however no principal change in the behaviour of a spatially localized initial condition is expected from that perspective .",
    "some rigorous results exist for the study of stability of certain plane waves . indeed , the corresponding modulational instability ( cf .",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) is responsible for the appearance of localized structures .",
    "however the linearization of the phase space flow around the plane wave in these studies limits possible conclusions about the appearance of strongly localized ilms or dbs .",
    "a nonperturbative and qualitatively new property of the evolution of spatially localized excitations takes place if the nonlinear terms become essential . instead of observing a decay in space , robust and seemingly exact spatially localized vibrational excitations",
    "have been observed .",
    "early results on ilms or dbs in fpu chains have been obtained by sievers , takeno and kisoda @xcite .",
    "these studies as well as their followups @xcite provide three types of observations and results , among others .",
    "first , they report on numerical evidence of the existence of long lived localized excitations , with lifetimes much larger than the typical oscillation times @xmath40 .",
    "the internal frequencies of such ilms are _ outside _ the spectrum @xmath29 . in figs.[fig2],[fig3],[fig4 ] some of these excitations are shown ( and will be discussed in more detail below ) .",
    "in fact , as will be discussed in the next sections , these excitations are _ exact _ solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "second , approximate numerical solutions were obtained using the _ rotating wave approximation _ which implies that a time - periodic solution is constructed taking into account only its first harmonics frequency contribution ( and optionally also a dc component ) and neglecting higher harmonics .",
    "the recipe is to use the ansatz @xmath41 , to insert it into the equations of motion ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) and to neglect all terms with higher harmonics which appear due to the nonlinear terms .",
    "the resulting set of coupled algebraic equations for the coefficients @xmath42 can be solved numerically for finite numbers of sites , and yields solutions similar to those observed in numerical simulations .",
    "this approximation is strictly speaking valid only for small amplitudes of the displacements .",
    "in reality however it may serve as a good estimate to exact solutions for rather large amplitudes as well .    and",
    "third , for quite long simulation times _ moving _ ilms have been observed , which in addition of being characterized by internal oscillations , propagate along the chain .",
    "typically the observed propagation velocities are _ smaller _ than the maximum group velocity @xmath43 .",
    "also the motion of these ilms along the lattice leaves excited lattice parts behind , implying that in the course of time these moving structures will slow down or disappear due to radiation of energy .",
    "while initially ilm excitations seemed to be connected to some specific properties of fpu chains , the observation of similar localized structures in klein - gordon chains as well as in higher dimensional lattices suggested that the existence of ilms is a rather generic feature for various anharmonic hamiltonian lattices @xcite .",
    "this view became a well established fact due to numerous studies during the past decade . in the following",
    "we will discuss the existence and properties of ilms or dbs in fpu chains using methods of the modern theory of localized excitations in discrete systems .",
    "discrete breathers ( intrinsic localized modes ) are time - periodic spatially localized solutions of the equations of motion of a hamiltonian lattice @xcite . in mathematical terms",
    "we are searching for solutions of ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) satisfying @xmath44 the difference @xmath45 characterizes the db induced lattice deformation and is related to the abovementioned effects of thermal expansion ( or contraction ) . without loss of generality",
    "we may choose @xmath46 in the following .",
    "the period @xmath47 is related to the db frequency @xmath48 .",
    "the db solution can be thus represented as a fourier series expansion with respect to time : @xmath49 the localization property ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) implies @xmath50 inserting ( [ 2 - 2b ] ) into the equations of motion ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) , and assuming a large distance from the db core , the linearization of the algebraic equations for the coefficients @xmath51 together with the condition ( [ 2 - 2c ] ) leads to the _ nonresonance _ condition @xcite @xmath52 for all integer @xmath53 .",
    "excluding @xmath54 for a moment , that condition implies @xmath55 .",
    "the possible resonance for @xmath54 which induces nonzero static lattice deformations , will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the stability of a db ( as for any periodic orbit ) can be accounted for by linearizing the phase space flow around a given db solution @xmath56 , i.e. by adding a small perturbation to it @xmath57 , inserting this expression into the equations of motion ( [ 1 - 2 ] ) and keeping only terms linear in @xmath58 : @xmath59 equations ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) define a map @xmath60 which maps the phase space of perturbations onto itself by integrating each point over the db period @xmath47 . here",
    "we used the abbreviation @xmath61 .",
    "the map ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) is characterized by a symplectic floquet matrix @xmath62 , whose complex eigenvalues @xmath63 and eigenvectors @xmath64 provide information about the stability of the db . for details we refer to @xcite . here",
    "we note that if all eigenvalues @xmath63 are of length one , then the db is linearly ( marginally ) _ stable_. otherwise perturbations exist which will grow in time ( typically exponentially ) and correspond to a linearly _ unstable _ db . upon changing a control parameter (",
    "e.g. the db frequency ) stable dbs can become unstable ( and vice versa ) .",
    "such a change of stability is appearing because two ( or more ) floquet eigenvalues collide on the unit circle and depart from it",
    ". if one of the two associated eigenvectors ( or both ) is spatially localized , such a collision and the corresponding instability are independent of the size of the lattice . if both eigenvectors are spatially delocalized , the strength of the instability depends on the size of the system and vanishes in the limit of an infinite system @xcite .",
    "the absence of a cubic term @xmath65 ( or more generally the case of a symmetric potential @xmath8 ) implies a parity symmetry of the interaction potential @xmath8 .",
    "consequently db solutions will contain only odd harmonics in a fourier expansion with respect to time , @xmath66 .",
    "that implies @xmath67 ( we remind the reader that @xmath46 as well ) .",
    "for such a case the floquet problem ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) is periodic with period @xmath68 , because the time - periodic coefficients in ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) contain only even harmonics @xmath69 in a fourier expansion with respect to time .",
    "two eigenvectors of the floquet matrix are corresponding to homogeneous shifts in all coordinates or likewise velocities ( due to the conservation of @xmath38 ) .",
    "their eigenvalues are always located at + 1 in the complex plane .",
    "two more eigenvectors of the floquet matrix are corresponding to perturbations along the db periodic orbit ( phase mode ) or along the family of db solutions .",
    "their eigenvalues are located either at + 1 for asymmetric potentials @xmath8 ( since the floquet mapping is performed for one period @xmath47 ) or at -1 for symmetric potentials @xmath8",
    "( since the floquet mapping is performed for @xmath68 ) .",
    "finally we will also use the linearized phase space flow dynamics around a db solution ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) in order to compute the transmission coefficient for a small amplitude plane wave launched into the db .",
    "it is a special bloch - type solution of the equations ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) of the form @xcite @xmath70 the db solution acts as a time - periodic scattering potential for an incoming wave with frequency @xmath29 and generates new _ channels _ at frequencies @xmath71 . if @xmath72 for nonzero @xmath53 then all channels are _ closed _ except for the open channel @xmath54 .",
    "such a situation corresponds to _ elastic _ scattering , i.e. the energies of the incoming and the outgoing ( transmitted and reflected ) waves are equal .",
    "otherwise we are confronted with _",
    "inelastic _ scattering .",
    "the scattering setup is schematically represented in fig.[figscat ] .",
    "+    for computational details the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the pioneering db existence proof of mackay and aubry @xcite was designed to apply for networks of weakly coupled oscillators using the implicit function theorem .",
    "the extension of this technique to fpu systems turned out to be complicated because one needs a limiting case where db solutions are compact .",
    "nevertheless it was applied successfully to the case of a _ diatomic _ fpu chain with alternating heavy and light masses @xcite .",
    "db solutions were shown to exist close to the limit where the ratio of light to heavy masses vanishes .    a special case of _ homogeneous _",
    "potentials @xmath8 with @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a given positive integer , was treated in @xcite to separate time and space dependence .",
    "this feature was then used in @xcite to provide a constructive proof of existence of dbs . as shown recently @xcite , this proof",
    "can be extended to systems with onsite potentials by adding @xmath75 to the hamiltonian ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "an implicit proof of existence of dbs in fpu models was provided by aubry et al in @xcite using a variational method .",
    "discrete breathers are obtained as loops in phase space which maximize a certain average energy function for a fixed pseudoaction .",
    "more recently james @xcite proved existence of dbs in fpu models for low amplitudes ( energies ) .",
    "all these results provide the certainty of existence of db solutions in infinite fpu models . however , due to the implicit character of most of these proofs a detailed study of db properties has to be obtained e.g. using advanced computational methods .",
    "computational tools for studying db properties are confined to the case of a finite lattice size .",
    "the typically exponential spatial degree of localization of dbs yields reliable results which apply for infinite lattice size as well . in terms of the dynamics in phase space",
    "@xmath76 we are searching for a starting point of a trajectory such that after integrating over a given period of time the trajectory reaches the starting point again .",
    "of course all points on the corresponding one - dimensional manifold generated by the trajectory fulfill this condition .",
    "discrete breathers are so - called isolated periodic orbits .",
    "that implies that fixing the total energy and mechanical momentum for a given db solution , no other db solutions are found in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of the db loop . in other words ,",
    "db solutions do not belong to higher dimensional _ resonant _ tori in the model phase space .",
    "however if changes in the energy are allowed , then generically infinitesimal deformations of the original db loop will result in a new db loop with slightly changed parameters such as energy , frequency or amplitude .",
    "sliding along such a family of db solutions may lead to a stability change of the solutions . here",
    "we use a newton method to find a db solution at a chosen frequency together with open boundary conditions . for details on this method as well as on numerical evaluations of the floquet matrix",

    "in all three cases the value of @xmath91 is very close to the locations of perfect transmission and reflection . in fig.[fig8 ] we plot the @xmath0-values of     ( diamonds ) and the associated locations of perfect transmission ( solid line ) and perfect reflection ( dashed line ) on @xmath93 for a page mode db with @xmath78 and @xmath95.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the oscillatory instability of the db @xmath91 from fig.[fig5 ] together with the positions of the perfect transmission and reflection as functions of @xmath93 . the obtained correlation between these resonant @xmath0-values is evident .",
    "from a general point of view , the db acts as a time - periodic scattering potential for incoming waves .",
    "the time - periodic scattering potential generates locally new frequencies from an incoming wave which correspond to closed channels .",
    "these closed channels provide additional propagation ways for the incoming wave . in that sense a time - periodic scattering potential in a strictly one - dimensional system acts similar to a local enlargement of the system dimensionality around the scatterer @xcite,@xcite .",
    "such additional propagation channels allow for wave interference , and may also cause a total _ destructive interference _ leading to a total reflection of the incoming wave , which is another way of understanding the origin of the observed fano resonance @xcite .",
    "note that in a strict sense the correlation between an oscillatory instability of a db solution and a corresponding fano resonance holds only for the limit of weak coupling between the localized floquet state and the floquet continuum @xcite . and only in that limiting case we can expect a nearby location of perfect reflection ( fano resonance ) and perfect transmission .",
    "the case of strong interaction can lead to the disappearance of an oscillatory instability in the floquet spectrum and of the perfect transmission peak , but simultaneously to a remaining of the fano resonance of perfect reflection @xcite .",
    "when the frequency @xmath93 is varied along a db family , we may consider the two limiting cases @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the high frequency limit implies large amplitudes inside the db core . the leading order contribution in the equations of motion",
    "will then be due to the @xmath123 term .",
    "the core profile of these high frequency dbs will be very similar to the db cores in figs.[fig2],[fig3 ] regardless the values of @xmath22 and @xmath65 which will only affect the tail characteristics @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "opposite to that , the low frequency limit is depending on the value of @xmath65 @xcite,@xcite .     versus db frequency @xmath93 for @xmath78 and @xmath95 ( lower curve ) and @xmath88 ( upper curve ) .",
    "insets : displacements @xmath77 for @xmath124 versus lattice site number @xmath5 .",
    "upper left inset for @xmath88 , lower right inset for @xmath95 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    in fig.[fig9 ] we plot the dependence of the db energy ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) on its frequency for @xmath88 and @xmath95 and 80 sites . for @xmath95",
    "the energy tends to zero as @xmath93 tends to @xmath125 .",
    "however for @xmath88 the db energy passes through a minimum as the frequency is lowered , and increases again with further approaching the limiting value @xmath125 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these results are intimately connected with the modulational instability of plane waves at small amplitudes @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . assuming that a db family has a zero amplitude limit",
    ", it follows that in a one - dimensional chain as discussed here its energy will also vanish in that limit @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured @xcite ( and later confirmed numerically @xcite ) that a small - amplitude db occurs due to an instability ( bifurcation ) of the @xmath119 plane wave . the rigorous analysis of this plane wave bifurcation gives an inequality @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xmath126 which has to hold in order to obtain the modulational instability of the @xmath119 mode and by conjecture a low - amplitude db solution .",
    "since inequality ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath78 and @xmath95 , we do observe the low amplitude ( and thus low energy ) limit of the db family in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "however choosing @xmath78 and @xmath88 , the inequality ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) is violated .",
    "consequently the @xmath119 mode does not experience a low amplitude modulational instability , and low amplitude ( and low energy ) dbs do not exist .",
    "nevertheless , as explained above , the high frequency limit of such an fpu model will always allow for db solutions of a well known asymptotic shape .",
    "consequently the energy versus frequency curve in fig.[fig9 ] has to show up with a minimum .",
    "it is instructive to compute the db profiles for @xmath93 close to @xmath125 for the two cases .",
    "these profiles are shown in the insets in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "for @xmath95 the low energy db delocalizes and takes the shape of a @xmath119 plane wave ( or better to say a standing wave , due to the open boundary conditions ) .",
    "the lattice deformation @xmath127 tends to zero when increasing the system size and further approaching @xmath128 . for @xmath88 the db with frequency close to @xmath125",
    "has still large amplitudes , including a nonzero and well pronounced lattice distortion @xmath129 .",
    "while both db branches have weak oscillatory instabilities as shown in fig.[fig5 ] , the dashed part of the upper curve in fig.[fig9 ] indicates that dbs from that part of the branch experience an additional instability with corresponding eigenvalues located on the real axis . when decreasing @xmath65 and approaching @xmath130 , which changes the sign of the l.h.s .",
    "of inequality ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) , the value of @xmath131 for dbs with frequencies close to the linear spectrum ( @xmath128 ) tends to zero and the energy threshold disappears .",
    "the results of this work can be continued - and have been continued - in many different directions . the unstable sievers - takeno mode db , when properly perturbed , lead to db - like excitations which propagate along the lattice @xcite,@xcite .",
    "some perturbative analytical results give a partial understanding of this effect @xcite .",
    "still there is strong evidence of the _ nonexistence _ of exact and spatially localized moving dbs @xcite .",
    "the inequality ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) can be used to predict the existence or noexistence of db solutions for various other fpu - like models .",
    "a consequence is that db excitations are not expected to exist for the toda chain .",
    "a similar conclusion can be obtained for a so - called _ roto - fpu _ model with @xmath132 .",
    "however such a system of coupled rotors allows for _ rotobreathers _ , i.e. solutions where a few degrees of freedom are in a rotating state , while the rest of the system is in a spatially localized oscillating state @xcite ( cf .",
    "fig.[figbreather_types](b ) ) .",
    "discrete breathers are not an exclusive property of one - dimensional lattices .",
    "they exist equally in higher dimensional lattices @xcite , where they show up with nonzero lower energy thresholds @xcite , independent on further model parameters .",
    "this is true also for generalizations of fpu models to higher lattice dimensions .",
    "an interesting result concerns the case of asymmetric interaction potentials @xmath8 and higher - dimensional fpu lattices .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the requirement to have a finite energy for a db leads to a static lattice deformation with a dipole symmetry and a spatial decay law @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the distance from the breather core and @xmath135 the lattice dimension .",
    "finally we mention a number of studies of fpu breathers emerging from perturbed extended states via modulational instability or induced by fluctuations in thermal equilibrium @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these studies show clearly that db solutions are not only interesting mathematical objects , but essential in order to understand and describe the properties of nonlinear lattice dynamics in thermal equilibrium and during relaxational processes .",
