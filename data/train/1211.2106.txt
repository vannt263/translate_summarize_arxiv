    "laser spectroscopy of optical transitions in highly charged ions ( hcis ) is a subject of considerable interest as it provides access to relativistic effects in few - electron systems and can be used to test bound - state qed in the extremely strong electric and magnetic fields in the vicinity of the ionic nucleus @xcite .",
    "experimentally , such magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions in mid-@xmath1 hcis have first been studied in electron - beam ion traps ( ebits )  by laser excitation and fluorescence detection @xcite , yielding a relative accuracy of a few ppm for the determination of the wavelength .",
    "direct laser spectroscopy of heavy ( high-@xmath1 ) hcis has so far only been performed at the experimental storage ring esr on hydrogen - like bismuth @xmath2bi@xmath3 @xcite and lead @xmath4pb@xmath5 @xcite . in both cases , the transition between the ground state hyperfine levels was induced by pulsed lasers and resonance fluorescence was recorded .",
    "these investigations have been extended to the ground - state hyperfine transition in lithium - like bismuth @xmath2bi@xmath6 , which has recently been observed in the experimental storage ring ( esr ) @xcite .",
    "this measurement in combination with the measurement on hydrogen - like bismuth will allow the first determination of the so - called specific difference between the hyperfine splittings @xmath7 as suggested by shabaev and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the first observation of the transition in @xmath2bi@xmath6 is an important step , but it will not provide sufficient accuracy for a high - precision determination of the qed effects in the specific difference , since the wavelength determination for both transitions ( h - like and li - like ) is still limited in accuracy due to the large doppler width and the uncertainty of additional doppler shifts caused by the relativistic ion motion in the storage ring .",
    "this will be considerably improved once high-@xmath1 highly charged ions are available at rest in a clean environment allowing for high - accuracy laser spectroscopy . to this end , the spectrap experiment has been designed @xcite .",
    "it is part of the highly charged heavy ion trap ( hitrap ) project @xcite at the gsi helmholtzzentrum darmstadt , which will provide hcis up to u@xmath8 at low energies suitable for capture into a penning trap .",
    "the precision achieved in the laser spectroscopy of trapped ions crucially depends on the width of the optical transition of interest and the mechanisms that lead to additional broadening , e.g.  doppler broadening .",
    "the study of forbidden transitions with high accuracy requires the elimination of doppler broadening .",
    "this can be achieved by first - order doppler - free techniques like two - photon transitions or by the trapping and cooling of atoms or ions .",
    "there is a variety of corresponding methods for the cooling of the ion motion , for a detailed overview see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the evaporative cooling of hcis in an ebit has been used for the laser spectroscopy of ar@xmath9 @xcite and recently in a penning trap on hcis that were produced in an ebit and then transported and re - trapped in a penning trap @xcite . at spectrap",
    "we make use of resistive cooling @xcite and laser cooling @xcite .",
    "the former is a very effective cooling mechanism for hcis , while the latter is most effective for ions with a level scheme suitable for laser cooling such as be@xmath10 or mg@xmath10 .",
    "laser - cooled ions can then be used for sympathetic cooling @xcite of simultaneously trapped hcis .",
    "such experiments have so far been performed with be@xmath10 in a penning trap @xcite and are foreseen in a paul trap @xcite . here , we present first studies with laser - cooled mg@xmath10 ions in the spectrap penning trap .",
    "we have performed systematic measurements with externally produced mg ions which have been captured in flight and stored .",
    "the observation of laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) down to the single - ion level allows a determination of the ion storage time , ion number and ion temperature .",
    "evidence for the formation of ion crystals has been observed .",
    "these measurements represent an initial characterization and optimization of the system as an important step towards the sympathetic cooling and precision laser spectroscopy of highly charged ions .",
    "penning traps are well - established tools for capture and confinement of externally produced ions .",
    "a static homogeneous magnetic field ensures radial confinement , while the electrode arrangement produces an electrostatic potential well which provides axial confinement of charged particles .",
    "ions can thus be localized , which allows laser irradiation and fluorescence detection under well - controlled conditions .",
    "stored ions can be motionally cooled to reduce the doppler broadening of transition lines to well below the ghz level .",
    "the achievable storage time is fundamentally limited only by the residual gas pressure inside the trap , since collisions with gas particles may lead to ion loss .",
    "typical storage times range from seconds to minutes , but also storage times of several months have been achieved @xcite . hence , also slow transitions like magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions can be investigated with high resolution and statistics .",
    "such traps have been realized in numerous variations especially concerning their geometry , for details see @xcite . for the purposes of laser spectroscopy ,",
    "trap geometries need to be chosen such that they allow both ions and light to enter and leave the trap suitably , as well as to provide the means for observing the fluorescence .",
    "the spectrap experiment employs a five - pole cylindrical penning trap with open endcaps @xcite , with an additional pair of capture electrodes , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the geometry is chosen such that the trap is orthogonal , i.e.  the trapping potential depth is independent from the choice of correction voltages used to make the trapping potential harmonic close to the trap centre .",
    "the ion motion in such a trap has been discussed in detail in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the open endcaps and capture electrodes yield axial access to the trap from both sides . in our case ,",
    "the ions enter from the top and the cooling laser from below , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : traplaser ] .",
    "the capture of externally produced ions is achieved by fast switching of trap voltages .",
    "the ring electrode is radially split into four segments to allow the use of a rotating wall @xcite for ion cloud compression and shaping .",
    "a central hole in each ring segment enables the detection of the stored ion fluorescence on radially positioned detectors outside the magnet vessel .",
    "the fluorescence light emerging out of the holes is collimated by plano - convex lenses . the geometrical light collection efficiency of this system is the main limiting factor of the total fluorescence detection efficiency .",
    "also , reflection and absorption in the lens and the vacuum windows as well as misalignments of the main optical axis reduce the signal . at the wavelength used for laser cooling of mg@xmath11",
    ", the detection efficiency was measured to be about @xmath12 .",
    "the trap is installed in a vertical , cold - bore , superconducting magnet with helmholtz configuration , such that direct optical access to the trap centre is possible through four radial ports in the horizontal plane . before it was consigned to gsi",
    ", the magnet was used for a similar experiment ( retrap at lawrence livermore national laboratory ) , with a slightly different penning trap configuration and radially cooled @xmath13 ions @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field in the trap centre can be set to any value up to 6 t and provides a relative central homogeneity of @xmath14 over a region of 2.5  cm .",
    "a liquid helium cryostat is used for cooling both the superconducting solenoids and the trap with its attached electronics .",
    "the residual gas pressure in the vacuum system is monitored in the room temperature region at the bottom of the magnet vessel , and typically amounts to @xmath15  mbar during magnet operation .",
    "there is no direct separation between the trap and the insulation vacuum of the cryostat , so additional cryopumping of the volume inside the trap is provided by the cold surfaces .",
    "hence , the vacuum conditions inside the trap can be assumed to be much better than indicated by the gauge , as will be discussed below .",
    "laser beams are guided into the trap along the central vertical axis , from a laser laboratory located under the superconducting magnet setup , as shown in fig.[fig : trapsetup ] .",
    "the fluorescence light is detected by a channel photo multiplier attached to the outside of the magnet vessel .",
    "it has a quantum efficiency of 18% and a very low dark count of some 20 hz .",
    "it is well suited for detection of uv light between 200 and 400 nm . because of its sensitivity to the stray magnetic field",
    "it was mounted in a magnetically shielded housing about 1 metre away from the main magnet chamber , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : trapsetup ] .        to avoid excess heating of the cryostat and prepare the system for injection of externally produced hci , mg ions are produced by an off - line ion source .",
    "it consists of a directly heated tungsten crucible filled with grains of mg metal .",
    "mg atoms leaving the crucible are ionized inside a cup - formed grid by electrons emitted from a thoriated tungsten filament located outside the grid .",
    "the potential of the grid sets the energy of the produced ions .",
    "they are collimated with an einzel lens and enter a 90@xmath16 quadrupole deflector , which guides them into the vertical part of the beamline .",
    "the quadrupole geometry is chosen to allow injection of ions from both sides of the beamline and to have free access along the vertical axis for the laser beam .",
    "two additional einzel lenses in the vertical beamline prepare the ion bunch for injection into the magnetic field and guide them into the trap .",
    "the second arm of the horizontal beamline will be connected to an ebit and later to the hitrap cooling trap in order to trap heavy hci provided by the gsi accelerator facility .",
    "mg ions are produced in bunches of 1 - 2 @xmath17s length at a rate of a few hz .",
    "they are transported towards the trap with a kinetic energy of 200 ev and dynamically captured into the penning trap .",
    "one typical trapping cycle is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : trappingcycle ] .",
    "initially , only the lower capture ( reflector ) electrode is permanently switched high ( closed ) , while the upper capture electrode is switched between a confining potential and a value just below the ion transport energy , synchronized with the arrival time of the ion bunch .",
    "it has been experimentally observed that around 50  ev out of 200  ev axial energy are transferred into the radial motion during the ion injection into the magnetic field .",
    "that is sufficient for the accumulation of many ion bunches , with minimal losses of ions already stored during the reopening of the capture electrode .",
    "typically 50 - 200 such accumulation cycles are repeated before permanently closing the capture electrode .",
    "the voltage on the endcaps and correction electrodes is then slowly ( with respect to the ion motion ) ramped up in order to compresses the ion cloud towards the trap centre .",
    "afterwards , laser cooling by scanning the laser wavelength as well as electronic ion excitation and detection are performed .",
    "a fast cooling method , such as laser cooling , is needed in order to rapidly decrease the energy of stored ions and reduce losses .",
    "as previously stated , direct laser cooling is limited to ions with a favourable level structure .",
    "such ions can then be used for sympathetic cooling of other ions of interest which are simultaneously stored .",
    "a suitable species for laser cooling is the @xmath18mg@xmath0 ion .",
    "it can be easily produced and the undisturbed ion provides a closed , ground - state , two - level @xmath19 - @xmath20 transition , with an excited state natural lifetime of only 4 ns . however , magnetic fields of several tesla in the penning trap lead to splitting of the mg sublevels due to the zeeman effect , as shown in fig .",

    "the laser is polarized @xmath41 and sent along the trap axis .",
    "a specific issue of the experiment is the relatively high kinetic energy of the captured ions , required for an efficient transport and a small ion bunch width .",
    "frequency detuning of the laser corresponding to a typical transport energy of 200  ev together with a very fast adjustment of this detuning to match the dropping energy caused by the cooling would be a serious technical challenge .",
    "however , a much simpler approach can be employed at the expense of the cooling speed : since the axial speed of the injected ions varies between a maximum corresponding to 200  ev at the trap centre and zero at the turning points near the endcaps , the laser can be kept fixed at a frequency corresponding to a cold ion .",
    "it can then absorb a photon near each turning point @xcite which is still efficient provided that the laser intensity is sufficiently large .",
    "the condition is that the rabi frequency for this transition is much larger than the axial frequency of the ion inside the trap , @xmath42 .",
    "it should be noted that only the axial ion motion will be directly cooled this way , since there is no cooling force acting on the ion cloud in the radial direction .",

    "unlike @xmath21 , the storage time of hci can be significantly smaller and an estimate should be made .",
    "ion loss is mainly attributed to charge exchange with residual gas particles .",

    "partial pressures of all other typical residual gases are much smaller at the cryogenic temperature around the trap , and can be safely neglected . alternatively , the cross section can also be estimated using the so - called classical barrier model @xcite which brings similar results .",

    "these lifetime - estimates were calculated for ion temperatures around 1  k or less and rapidly decrease with increasing ion temperature , pointing towards the need for rapid ion cooling , such as sympathetic cooling with laser cooled @xmath21 .",
    "the laser cooling time can be estimated by evaluating the cooling force exerted by the photons .",
    "generally , for low energy ions , the scattering of the photons leads to a frictional force @xmath81 which slows the ion down .",
    "it can be written as @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the photon momentum , @xmath84 is the transition linewidth , @xmath64 is the intensity of the laser , @xmath85 the saturation intensity and @xmath86 the detuning of the laser frequency .",
    "this force is proportional to the laser intensity below the saturation value and it approaches its maximum value @xmath87 for intensities @xmath88 .    here , the kinetic energy of the captured ions is typically 200  ev , and the laser frequency can not be scanned fast enough to maintain the cooling condition .",

    "this equation is a good approximation for an intensity close to or above the saturation intensity .",

    "initially , the ions have a large spatial oscillation amplitude between the endcaps while the fluorescence detection system is focused on a small volume at the centre of the trap . hence ,",
    "the emitted photons can not be recorded and only the background signal is present . as the ions are cooled , they get localized in the centre of the trap and the fluorescence rate per ion rises as the doppler - shifted transition matches the fixed red - detuned laser frequency for an increasing amount of ions .",

    "[ fig : ionlifetime ] , which appears about 10 seconds after raising the endcaps to the trapping potential .",
    "the measured value is of the same order of magnitude , but smaller than the predicted 40 s because of uneven ion velocity distribution and a finite probability for photon absorption also outside the natural linewidth of the transition .",

    ".,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    it can be seen that the central frequencies from the two measurements , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cycresonance ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cyclaser ] , differ by 1.33  khz .",
    "this exceeds the statistical fitting uncertainty and was found in several repeated measurements .",
    "the systematic shift corresponds to a magnetic field difference of 2  mt .",
    "the discrepancy is ascribed to the non - ideal magnetic field and the different spatial positions where the two measurements were performed : while the ft - icr induces a signal directly in the trap electrodes , the lif - signal depends on the optical axis of the detector system , which is not necessarily aligned exactly along the trap radial axis . adding a camera to the system will allow us to measure position , shape and radial extent of the cloud , which is of special interest when the rotating wall is applied .",
    "nevertheless , it was demonstrated that electronic and laser induced fluorescence ion detection methods can be used simultaneously , with reasonably good agreement .      by",
    "determining the transition linewidth @xmath114 and assuming the absence of line - broadening mechanisms other than doppler broadening , the upper limit to the ion temperature @xmath115 can be calculated according to @xcite @xmath116    a series of measurements was performed in order to determine the transition linewidth of the laser - cooled @xmath21 .",
    "the laser frequency was kept 1 ghz red - detuned during ion accumulation , as well as for another 10 seconds after closing the trap .",
    "it was observed that due to the large initial ion energy this pre - cooling time was necessary for efficient laser cooling .",
    "after pre - cooling , the laser frequency was scanned over the central transition frequency of mg@xmath11 and the fluorescence recorded .",
    "a typical result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal ] , where the recorded fluorescence rate was plotted against the laser frequency detuning .     as a function of frequency detuning .",
    "the width of the measured transition can be used to set the upper limit to the achieved ion temperature . a precooling peak and an abrupt drop after crossing the zero is typically associated with crystalline structure of the ion cloud.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    after crossing the resonance frequency , ion cooling turns into heating and the fluorescence drops quickly to zero .",
    "it can therefore be safely assumed that the total fwhm of the voigt profile is less than twice the observed width of 33(10 ) mhz indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal ] .",
    "this value is of the same order of magnitude as the natural linewidth of the transition ( 42 mhz ) , and a deconvolution of the doppler and the natural linewidth contribution to the line profile needs to be performed @xcite .",
    "the deconvoluted value for the doppler width can be inserted into eq .   and an upper limit for the ion temperature is obtained @xmath117    by experience from a similar experiment @xcite , the typical volume of such an ion cloud is of the order of 0.5 mm@xmath118 , resulting in an ion number density of around @xmath119 ions / mm@xmath118 for @xmath21 ions stored in spectrap . under such conditions",
    "the single - particle description begins to break down and the ion cloud has to be treated as a non - neutral plasma .",
    "the plasma coupling parameter , describing the ion coulomb coupling intensity in one - component plasmas , is given by @xcite @xmath120{\\frac{3}{4\\pi",
    "n } } \\label{eq : plasmacoupling}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "gilbert and co - workers have predicted that for coupling parameters @xmath122 the plasma starts gradually to exhibit liquid - like properties @xcite . according to eq .  ,",
    "for @xmath21 trapped and cooled in spectrap ( @xmath123 ions / mm@xmath118 and @xmath124 ) the plasma coupling parameter amounts to @xmath125 , such that strong ion coupling may be assumed .",
    "after the planned introduction of hci into the trap , the temperatures of the two components are expected to roughly equalize , resulting in a much larger @xmath126 for high charge states @xcite .",
    "studies have already shown that for sufficiently low temperatures , a trapped ion cloud exhibits a structural change and its spectrum resembles the one of single ions @xcite .",
    "a similar behaviour was observed for the trapped @xmath21 in spectrap and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crystal ] .",
    "a small pre - cooling peak appears at the point where the transition s doppler broadened half - width becomes smaller than the laser detuning ( here at @xmath45  400  mhz ) , after which the fluorescence disappears and can be observed again only close to the natural linewidth of the transition .",
    "such structures were observed also in @xcite and mark the transition of the stored ion plasma from a non - correlated to a strongly coupled state . because of strong cooling and simultaneous reduction of the doppler width",
    ", the fluorescence close to the resonant frequency is characterized by a sharp asymmetric shape , followed by an abrupt drop to zero after crossing the central frequency .    the spectrum shown in fig .  [ fig : crystal ] was recorded with 1.1  mw / mm@xmath107 of laser power and a 100  mhz / s frequency sweep .",
    "it has been observed that different pre - cooling times cause different positions of the pre - cooling peak with respect to the main one , moving them closer together for shorter pre - cooling times .",
    "this structure was , however , not observed for very short pre - cooling times below roughly 8 s , which were also typically followed by much smaller or no detectable fluorescence .",
    "however , after allowing sufficient pre - cooling time and observing the crystalline structure , a smaller , sharp fluorescence peak was observed at resonance even when scanning the laser frequency in the opposite direction .",
    "we have performed systematic measurements with laser - cooled @xmath127mg@xmath128 ions stored in a penning trap .",
    "these ions were externally produced , transported , captured and stored in the trap for subsequent measurements . using both optical and electronic non - destructive detection techniques , the properties of stored ion clouds were determined . combining electronic with optical detection , it is possible to determine stored ion numbers down to the single ion level and to characterize the stored ion cloud with respect to its temperature , storage time and related properties .",
    "laser cooling was achieved to temperatures below 0.1  k and evidence of ion crystallization was found .",
    "such laser - cooled ions are ideal for sympathetic cooling of simultaneously trapped ion species which lack a suitable level scheme , as for example the highly charged ions that will be available in the near future .",
    "all necessary prerequisites for precision spectroscopy of externally produced highly charged ions to be delivered by the hitrap facility at gsi were demonstrated in the present setup with singly charged magnesium ions .",
    "further investigation of sympathetic cooling of mid - z highly charged ions in spectrap will be carried out in the near future .",
    "finally , the measurements of forbidden transitions in heavy highly charged ions will open the way to precision tests of qed calculations in extreme fields and to the determination of fundamental constants .",
