    "any crystal in equilibrium will contain defects , such as vacancies , interstitials and dislocations . of these , the point defects are the most common .",
    "some thirty years ago , bennett and alder@xcite estimated the equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a hard - sphere crystal and found that , close to melting , this concentration could be quite high ( typically , one vacancy per @xmath1 lattice sites ) . at present , the question of the concentration ( and transport ) of point defects in ( colloidal ) hard - sphere crystals takes on a renewed  and now quite practical  significance .",
    "apart from the theoretical interest in hard sphere crystals as a model system , crystals from colloidal particles , having lattice sizes comparable to the wavelength of light , are being prepared and studied because of their potentially interesting photonic properties . clearly",
    "the presence of even a small number of defects can have a pronounced effect on the nature of photonic states in such materials .",
    "moreover , as the accuracy of free energy calculations increases , it is no longer permissible to ignore the contribution of vacancies to the total free energy .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to review briefly the statistical mechanical description of a crystal with point defects .",
    "this problem is not completely trivial , as the concept of a vacancy or interstitial is inextricably linked to that of lattice sites . and lattice sites loose their meaning in a disordered state .",
    "so , we should first address the question : when is it permissible to count states with a different number of lattice sites as distinct ?",
    "the answer is , of course , that this is only true if these different states can be assigned to distinct volumes in phase space .",
    "this is possible if we impose that every particle in a crystal is confined to its wigner - seitz cell . in three dimensional crystals ,",
    "this constraint on the positions of all particles has little effect on the free energy ( in contrast , in a _ liquid _",
    "it is not at all permissible ) . in a two - dimensional crystal ,",
    "the constraint is more problematic , at least in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , for large but finite two - dimensional systems , the single - occupancy cell constraint is also quite reasonable .",
    "below , we describe two alternative ( but equivalent ) routes to arrive at the free energy of a crystal with vacancies . in one case ,",
    "we use the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "this would seems to be the most obvious ensemble to use when describing a system with a fluctuating number of particles .",
    "yet , the analysis is complicated by the fact that not only the number of particles , but also the number of lattice sites , may fluctuate . in the second analysis , we consider an isothermal - isobaric system .",
    "the latter approach is simpler and is , apart from a minor correction , equivalent to the one followed by bennett and alder@xcite .",
    "we then describe our numerical approach to compute the concentration of interstitials in a hard - sphere crystal .",
    "we compare our numerical results with a simple theoretical estimate .",
    "when considering the statistical mechanics of a crystal with vacancies , it is convenient to consider first a system with a fixed number of lattice sites , @xmath2 , contained in a volume @xmath3 .",
    "if this crystal is in contact with a particle - reservoir at chemical potential @xmath4 , then the number of vacancies in the crystal may fluctuate . in principle , the crystal could also contain interstitials but , for the time being , we shall ignore this possibility .",
    "it is then easy to write down the expression for the grand potential of the crystal @xmath5 : @xmath6 q_{m - n}(v , t ) \\label{grand1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 .",
    "note that this is not the true grand potential , because we should also allow for fluctuations in the number of lattice sites .",
    "we denote the free energy of a crystal with _ no _ vacancies by @xmath8 . in practice",
    ", the equilibrium concentration of vacancies in a crystal is very low .",
    "we shall therefore make the approximation that vacancies do not interact .",
    "this assumption is not as reasonable as it seems , as the interaction of vacancies through the stress field is quite long - ranged .",
    "the assumption that vacancies are ideal makes it easier to compute the canonical partition function of a crystal with @xmath9 vacancies : @xmath10 where we have used the notation @xmath11 to denote the free energy of a crystal with @xmath9 vacancies _ at given positions_. as the vacancies are assumed to be non - interacting , it is clear that we can write @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the free energy per particle in the defect - free crystal and -@xmath14 is the change in free energy of a crystal due to the creation of a single vacancy at a specific lattice point . combining eqns .",
    "( [ grand1 ] ) , ( [ qnvac ] ) and ( [ fnvac2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath15 \\exp \\big[-\\beta ( mf_{0}-nf_{1 } ) \\big ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & q_{m}\\exp(m\\beta\\mu)\\bigg [ 1 + \\exp\\big(-\\beta\\lbrack\\mu - f_{1}]% \\big)\\bigg ] ^{m }   \\label{fvacancy1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] usually , @xmath16 $ ] is much less than unity .",
    "this allows us to write : @xmath17 \\big ) \\bigg ]   \\label{fvacancy}\\ ] ] using @xmath18 the average number of vacancies follows as @xmath19   \\label{nvac}\\ ] ] now , we should take into account the fact that , actually , the number of lattice sites itself is not fixed but will adjust to the number of vacancies .",
    "the total grand partition function is therefore a sum over all states with different number of lattice sites @xmath20 . in practice , @xmath21 .",
    "we can then write @xmath22 note that @xmath5 depends on both @xmath23 and @xmath4 .",
    "we now choose the reference number of lattice sites such that in that particular case @xmath4 is equal to the chemical potential of the perfect lattice .",
    "that is : @xmath24 we also introduce a rather strange quantity , namely the `` grand canonical '' partition function of a perfect lattice with a fixed number of particles @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "of course , @xmath27 is _ not _ a true grand - canonical partition function , as the number of particles in this system is fixed .",
    "the grand canonical partition function then becomes : @xmath28   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "& \\times & \\exp \\big[(m+\\delta m)\\beta\\mu \\big ] \\exp \\bigg[\\big(m+\\delta m% \\big)\\exp \\big(-\\beta\\lbrack \\mu - f_{1 } ] \\big ) \\bigg ]   \\label{xi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume ( as usual ) that , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath29 is dominated by the largest term in the sum .",
    "hence , we have to determine the point where the derivative of @xmath29 with respect to @xmath2 vanishes . to this end",
    ", we perform a taylor expansion of the exponent in eqn .",
    "( [ xi1 ] ) in powers of @xmath30 .",

    "( [ xiexp ] ) but only to first order in the preceding terms .",
    "however , as we show below , we actually expand  consistently  to second order in the vacancy concentration .",
    "we define the fractional change in the number of lattice sites , @xmath41 , as @xmath42 similarly , we define the vacancy concentration @xmath43 as @xmath44\\ ] ] finding the maximum in the exponent is then equivalent to maximizing @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the value of @xmath43 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the density of the ideal reference lattice .",
    "the maximum value is at @xmath49 and the maximum of the grand canonical potential is @xmath50 hence , the presence of vacancies increases the grand potential ( as it should ) _ and it changes  ( increases ) the number of lattice sites_. however , ignoring terms of order @xmath51 , the vacancy concentration is still given by eqn .",
    "( [ nvac ] ) .",
    "the next question is : how do vacancies affect the melting curve .",
    "now our definition of the reference system ( i.e. the perfect lattice with the same @xmath52 ) turns out to be convenient .",
    "note that the grand canonical partition function is related to the pressure by @xmath53 ignoring terms quadratic in the vacancy concentration , we find that the effect of allowing for vacancies is to increase the pressure of the solid by an amount @xmath54 let us assume that the liquid was in equilibrium with the perfect crystal at pressure @xmath55 and chemical potential @xmath4 . then it is easy to verify that the shift in the coexistence pressure due to the presence of vacancies is @xmath56 and the corresponding shift in the chemical potential at coexistence is @xmath57 direct calculations of the vacancy concentration in a hard - sphere crystal at melting @xcite indicate that @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the increase in the coexistence pressure due to vacancies is @xmath59 @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the particle diameter ) .",
    "the corresponding shift in the chemical potential at coexistence is @xmath62 note that this shift is very significant when compared to the accuracy of absolute free - energy calculations of the crystalline solid@xcite .",
    "bennett and alder@xcite work with the gibbs free energy rather than the helmholtz free energy .",
    "their expression for the vacancy concentration is based on the analysis of the effect of vacancies on the gibbs free energy of a system of @xmath63 particles at constant pressure and temperature .",
    "first , we define @xmath64 , the variation in the gibbs free energy of a crystal of @xmath2 particles due to the introduction of a single vacancy _ at a given lattice position _ @xmath65 where the first subscript refers to the number of lattice sites in the system , and the second subscript to the number of vacancies . in this equation",
    "we distinguish @xmath2 , the original number of lattice sites , and @xmath63 , the number of particles , even though in the present case @xmath66 let us write @xmath14 ( eqn .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) ) as @xmath67 hence , @xmath68 the next step is to introduce a hypothetical defect free crystal with @xmath2 lattice sites , at the same pressure as the system with @xmath69 lattice sites .",
    "the volume of this system is @xmath70similarly , the free energy of this hypothetical system is @xmath71 note also that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the difference in volume of a vacancy and a particle , at constant pressure and number of lattice sites .",
    "moreover , @xmath74 hence , the gibbs free energy difference associated with the formation of a vacancy at a specific lattice site , @xmath75 , is then @xmath76 where we have defined @xmath77 .",
    "now we have to include the entropic contribution due to the distribution of @xmath9 vacancies over @xmath2 lattice sites .",
    "this total gibbs free energy then becomes @xmath78\\ln \\left[1-\\frac{n}{m}\\right ] \\right ) \\\\ &",
    "\\approx & g_{0}(n)+ng^{vac}+nkt\\ln\\frac{n}{m}-nkt\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we minimize the gibbs free energy with respect to @xmath9 , we find @xmath79 where we have ignored a small correction due to the variation of @xmath80 with @xmath9 .",
    "if we insert this value in the expression for the total gibbs free energy , we find : @xmath81 the total number of particles is @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "hence the gibbs free energy _ per particle _",
    "is @xmath84 thus the change in chemical potential of the solid is @xmath85 from which it follows that the change in _ pressure _ of the solid at fixed chemical potential is equal to @xmath86 this is equivalent to eqn .",
    "( [ deltapsolid ] ) above .",
    "hence the bennett - alder scheme is equivalent to the `` grand - canonical '' scheme    it should be pointed out that the variation in volume due to the replacement of a particle by a vacancy can be computed either directly , in a constant - pressure simulation , or indirectly by measuring the change in pressure in a constant volume simulation .",
    "the two methods are related through the thermodynamic relation @xmath87 noting that the number of vacancies is @xmath88 , we can see that the change in pressure with the number of vacancies for a fixed number of lattice sites , is @xmath89 in particular , the pressure change due to one vacancy ( i.e. @xmath37 , defined in eqn .",
    "( [ deltap01 ] ) ) is @xmath90",
    "numerically , it is straightforward to compute the equilibrium vacancy concentration . as before ,",
    "the central quantity that needs to be computed is @xmath91 , the change in free energy of a crystal due to the creation of a single vacancy at a specific lattice point .",
    "in fact , it is more convenient to consider @xmath92 , the change in free energy due to the removal of a vacancy at a specific lattice point .",
    "this quantity can be computed in several ways .",
    "for instance , we could use a particle - insertion method .",
    "we start with a crystal containing one single vacancy and attempt a trial insertion in the wigner - seitz cell surrounding that vacancy .",
    "then @xmath14 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the volume of the wigner - seitz cell , and @xmath95 is the change in potential energy associated with the insertion of a trial particle . for hard particles @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the probability that the trial insertion in the wigner - seitz cell will be accepted .",
    "as most of the wigner - seitz cell is not accessible , it is more efficient to attempt insertion in a sub - volume ( typically of the order of the cell - volume in a lattice - gas model of the solid ) .",
    "however , then we also should consider the reverse move  the removal of a particle from a sub - volume @xmath98 of the wigner - seitz cell , in a crystal without vacancies .",
    "the only thing we need to compute in this case is @xmath99 , the probability that a particle happens to be inside this volume .",
    "the expression for @xmath14 is then @xmath100 of course , in the final expression for the vacancy concentration , the factor @xmath101 drops out ( as it should ) , because it is cancelled by the same term in the ideal part of the chemical potential .      as in the case of vacancies , the calculation of interstitials centers around the calculation of @xmath102 , the free energy associated with introducing an interstitial into the system ( in the npt ensemble ) .",
    "@xmath102 can be expressed as a sum of two parts : the free energy of introducing a point particle into the system ( @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the packing fraction ) , and the free energy of growing that particle to the same diameter ( @xmath105 ) as the other particles ( @xmath106 ) .    for the calculation of @xmath106",
    ", we simulate an extended system consisting of a lattice of @xmath63 particles with diameter @xmath107 on ( or near ) lattice sites and one extra ( interstitial ) particle that has a diameter @xmath108 that can vary freely .",
    "we interpret @xmath109 as an additional coordinate and , in this sense , the system that we are considering is an extended system .",
    "the partition sum for the extended system is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the partition function for the isothermal - isobaric system with one interstitial particle with radius @xmath112 .",
    "the probability of finding the interstitial particle with a specific radius @xmath113 is @xmath114 and the gibbs free energy @xmath115 of a system with an interstitial with diameter @xmath109 is equal to @xmath116 thus , the free energy difference between a system with a pointlike interstitial ( @xmath117 ) and a full - grown interstitial ( @xmath118 ) is @xmath119    it is obvious that @xmath120 is can be very small for large values of @xmath109 . in order to get an accurate histogram for @xmath121",
    ", we have to use a biased sampling scheme .",
    "we employ the method of umbrella - sampling / multicanonical sampling @xcite , where we associate a weight @xmath122 with @xmath123 , which we use while sampling over @xmath124 : @xmath125 if we sample over this distribution , we get a histogram @xmath126 , for which we can get the desired histogram @xmath127 by refolding the bias : @xmath128    the weights @xmath122 are obtained by iteratively running the system and calculating ( for the run @xmath129 , from the results of run @xmath130 ) @xmath131 where @xmath132 is an arbitrary constant @xcite",
    ". this will make the histogram @xmath133 converge to a flat distribution over the accessible range .",
    "the fcc crystal has two types of possible places , or ` holes ' in which interstitials can reside : one of octahedral shape and one of tetrahedral shape .",
    "there are four octahedral holes and eight tetrahedral holes in one fcc unit cell .",
    "to measure the relative concentrations of interstitials in these two types of holes , it turns out it is not possible to try to prepare the system in one hole and calculate @xmath106 , because during the course of a simulation the interstitial makes many hops .",
    "these hops are caused by the interstitial taking the place of a lattice particle which then becomes the interstitial .    in order to measure the relative occupation probability of the different holes , the interstitial has to be traced .",
    "this is done by the following scheme : at the start of the simulation , every particle @xmath130 , except the original interstitial , is assigned to a lattice position @xmath134 . at fixed sampling intervals ,",
    "the squared distance between the original interstitial and the nearest lattice sites ( @xmath135 ) is compared with @xmath136 . if @xmath137 , the interstitial and particle @xmath130 exchange identity ( i.e. the interstitial acquires a lattice position @xmath134 and particle @xmath130 becomes the interstitial ) .",
    "once we have identified the interstitial , it is straightforward to assign it to a tetrahedral or octahedral hole .",
    "the free energy calculations were performed with @xmath138 particle systems ( @xmath139 cubic fcc unit cells ) at four different pressures .",
    "different parts of the histogram @xmath140 were calculated in parallel , and subsequently combined .",
    "the calculation of the weights took about @xmath141 iterations of @xmath142 mc sweeps per cpu on 5 cpu s .",
    "once the weights were known for one pressure , they could be used as starting points for the other pressures , accelerating the weight calculation considerably .",
    "final calculations were done with approximately @xmath141 iterations of @xmath143 sweeps each ( again on 5 cpu s ) .",
    "the final @xmath144 histograms for all four pressures are plotted in fig .",
    "[ pw ] .    for the calculation of @xmath145 at the different pressures",
    ", the results for the free energy of the perfect crystal @xcite were used together with halls@xcite equation of state .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ x_fig ] and table [ restable ] . for one pressure ( @xmath146 , the coexistence pressure )",
    ", we calculated @xmath147 for a larger system ( @xmath148 ) to check for finite - size effects ; as can be seen from the results , these are negligible . using the interstitial type discrimination algorithm described above , it was found that the ( bigger ) octahedral holes are *  * far more likely to contain the interstitial than the tetrahedral holes ( see table .[restable ] ) .",
    "as octahedral holes are the largest cavities in a fcc crystal , we limit our analysis to these .",
    "the number of octahedral holes in a fcc crystal is equal to the number of lattice sites , the derivation of the expression for the concentration of interstitials is almost identical to the one for the vacancy concentration .",
    "let us denote the change in free energy associated with the introduction of an interstitial at a specific octahedral site by @xmath149 .",

    ", this radius equals @xmath154 0.229 @xmath124 .",
    "clearly , in order to fit in an interstitial , the cavity has to be expanded . if we assume that the crystal is elastically isotropic ( a fair approximation for a cubic crystal ) then the work need to create a cavity of radius @xmath155 equals@xcite @xmath156 where @xmath145 is the shear lam coefficient .",

    ", it should be at least 0.5@xmath124 , otherwise the interstitial would not fit into the lattice .",

    "however , at higher densities , the agreement becomes worse , possibly because it is no longer justified to assume isotropic , linear , elastic behavior around an interstitial ( see table [ restable ] ) .    in summary , we have shown that the equilibrium concentration of interstitials in hard - sphere crystals is so low that most experiments will not be able to detect them .",
    "we find that interstitials are quite mobile .",
    "this implies that interstitials that are trapped during crystal growth should be able to diffuse rapidly to the crystal surface .",
    "this information is good news for experimentalists trying to grow photonic bandgap materials .",
