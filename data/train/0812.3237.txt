    "unlike the case for stars , the relative size and separation between galaxies is small , suggesting that galaxy interactions and mergers could be a major process in driving galaxy formation .",
    "observational attempts to determine the role of galaxy mergers in the local universe have been limited to studies of how star formation and black hole growth are induced by the merger process ( e.g. , barton et al .",
    "2000 ; ellison et al .",
    "it is however clear that ongoing major galaxy merging is rare in the nearby universe , and is likely not a dominant mode for the future evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , patton et al .",
    "if galaxy mergers play a major role in galaxy formation they must have occurred earlier in the history of the universe .",
    "attempts to trace the merger history in the early universe has been carried out using two primary methods .",
    "the oldest method involves measuring the fraction of galaxies which are in physical pairs at various look - back times , or redshifts ( e.g. , patton et al . 2002 ; le fevre et al .",
    "2000 ; lin et al . 2004",
    "; lin et al . 2008 ; bluck et al . 2008 ) .",
    "a newer method , with a considerable background history ( e.g. , holmberg 1941 ; vorontsov - velyaminov 1959 ; arp 1966 ) , uses the structures of galaxies to determine the merger history ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ; conselice et al . 2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "it is , however , not yet known if the two methods are revealing the same merger history for galaxies , although at @xmath15 , the agreement between the two methods appears good ( e.g. , de propris et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the merger history of galaxies is still largely only beginning to be measured with some certainty .",
    "two issues that still need to be addressed are the reliability of the current methods for determining merger histories , and the relatively small areas thus far used to find mergers .",
    "both of these issues limit our ability to accurately measure the merger history .",
    "the reliability argument has been addressed in great detail in papers such as conselice ( 2003 ) , conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , conselice et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and lotz et al .",
    "briefly , the merger history can only be measured using special techniques and data , such as complete redshift surveys and/or deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging .",
    "it turns out that when examining galaxies that fit a structural merger criteria , nearly all are ongoing major mergers , as judged by eye and through kinematics ( e.g. , conselice 2000a , b ; conselice 2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "this hold for low and high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003 ) , and is also seen when examining n - body models of the merging process ( conselice 2006 ; lotz et al",
    ". 2008b ) .    using structure to determine the merger history requires the use of hst imaging or adaptive optics ( ao ) . however , the small fields of view used in hst and ao surveys make it difficult to measure the merger history with a high certainty , simply due to the small number of galaxies that have been examined .",
    "another issue is that it is difficult to measure the merger history at higher redshifts due to the fact that there is very little high resolution deep near - infrared imaging , which is needed to directly study the rest - frame optical structures of @xmath16 galaxies .",
    "this is required , as the rest - frame optical appearance of a galaxy often differs significantly from the rest - frame ultraviolet morphology ( e.g. , windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ; taylor - mager et al .",
    "2007 ) . ideally in the future , using multiple band data , it is desirable to measure parameters and structures on stellar mass images ( e.g. , lanyon - foster et al .",
    "2009 ) .    for our merger measurements , we utilise the cas method ( e.g. , conselice 2003 ) for determining the presence of galaxy mergers in the galaxy population at @xmath17 .",
    "we first re - evaluate the use of the asymmetry index ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ) , and the cas method itself for locating major mergers .",
    "we furthermore use our derived merger fractions to characterise the major galaxy merger evolution for m@xmath1 galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss various ways in which this merger evolution can be parameterised , investigating power - law , exponential , and the combination of the two forms .",
    "we conclude that the use of a @xmath12 prior in fitting the merger fraction is a significant factor in the determination of the power - law slope @xmath19 .",
    "we show that this value of @xmath19 can vary between @xmath20 and @xmath21 depending on how the merger fraction is fit ( cf .",

    "2008 for ultra massive galaxies ) .",
    "in this paper we use the two largest hst advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging data sets - the extended groth strip ( egs ) and the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) to determine , using @xmath22 massive galaxies , the detailed merger history at @xmath2 .",
    "this is an important epoch for measuring the merger history , and there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the merging history during this epoch , which traces the last half of the universe . by using acs f814w band images we are also tracing the structures of these galaxies in the rest - frame optical out to @xmath23 and do not need to consider the sometimes considerable morphological @xmath24corrections when imaging galaxies in the ultraviolet ( e.g. , taylor - mager et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "our general conclusion is that the merger fraction increases with higher redshifts to @xmath25 .",
    "we use the latest model based time - scales for galaxies in pairs to merge , and for galaxies to remain symmetric during mergers , to calculate the number of mergers a typical m@xmath1 galaxy will undergo at @xmath18 , as well as the galaxy merger rate .",
    "we conclude that a typical m@xmath1 galaxy will undergo 1 - 2 major mergers at @xmath17 .",
    "we also investigate how structural merger fractions compare with pair fractions , finding that at a given redshift , within the same population of galaxies , the cas merger fraction is 3 - 6 times higher than the pair fraction .",
    "we show that the ratio of the time - scales for cas mergers and 20 kpc pairs is nearly the same as the merger - pair fraction ratio .",
    "both methods therefore appear to trace the same merging population at different phases .",
    "this is further evidence that we are indeed measuring correctly the merging properties of galaxies .",
    "this paper is organised as follows :  2 includes a discussion of the data sources we use in this paper , and how we select our sample , including a description of our morphological and structural analyses , and the stellar masses we utilise ,  3 is a discussion of our results , including a description of the merger history up to @xmath25 , and  4 is our summary and conclusions .",

    "2007b , 2008b ) .",
    "the determination of the egs photometric redshifts is done in a different way than in the cosmos field . within the egs ,",
    "photometric redshifts are based on the optical+near infrared imaging , in the brijk bands , and are fit in two ways , depending on the brightness of a galaxy in the optical . for galaxies that meet the spectroscopic criteria , @xmath53 , we utilise a neural network photometric redshift technique to take advantage of the vast number of secure redshifts with similar photometric data .",
    "most of the @xmath53 sources not targeted for spectroscopy should be within our redshift range of interest , at @xmath57 .",
    "the neural network fitting is done through the use of the annz ( collister & lahav 2004 ) method and code .",
    "to train the code , we use the @xmath54 redshifts in the egs , which has galaxies spanning our entire redshift range .",
    "the training of the photometric redshift fitting was in fact only done using the egs field , whose galaxies are nearly completely selected based on a magnitude limit of @xmath53 .",

    "the agreement between our photometric redshifts and our annz spectroscopic redshifts is very good using this technique , with @xmath58 out to @xmath59 .",
    "the agreement is even better for the m@xmath60 galaxies where we find @xmath61 across all of our four fields ( conselice et al .",
    "2007b ) .    for galaxies which are fainter than @xmath62 in the egs we utilise photometric redshifts using bayesian techniques , and the software from benitez ( 2000 ) .",
    "for an object to have a photometric redshift we require that it be detected at the 3-@xmath42 level in all optical and near - infrared ( brijk ) bands , which in the r - band reaches @xmath52 .",
    "we optimised our results , and correct for systematics , through the comparison with spectroscopic redshifts , resulting in a redshift accuracy of @xmath63 for @xmath64 systems .",
    "these @xmath64 galaxies are , however , only a very small part of our sample",
    ". furthermore , all of these systems are at @xmath65 .",
    "since stellar masses are a critical aspect of this analysis , we go into some detail for how these are calculated .",
    "the stellar masses for the cosmos survey are taken from mobasher et al .",
    "these stellar masses are computed through the use of k - band imaging and the measured rest - frame @xmath66 colours of galaxies within cosmos .",
    "mobasher et al .",
    "( 2007 ) use this measured colour to obtain a mass to light ratio through the relation :    @xmath67    which assumes a salpeter imf within a mass range of 0.1 to 100 .",
    "the colours used in this analysis are not directly measured from the data , but are taken from the best fit templates of various types ( e , sa , sb , sc , i m and starburst ) ( see mobasher et al . 2007 ) . due to",
    "limited k - band data over the cosmos field , the stellar masses of these galaxies are calculated via rest - frame v - band magnitudes with the equation :    @xmath68    mobasher et al .",
    "( 2007 ) discuss using v - band luminosities for measuring stellar masses rather than k - band , which is very shallow over the cosmos fields .",
    "they find for a subset of their sources , which are detected in the k - band , an agreement with the v - band based stellar masses , these are however the reddest , and thus perhaps the most evolved galaxies , and therefore may not be representative .    within the egs field",
    "we match our k - band selected catalogs to the cfht optical data to obtain spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for all of our sources , resulting in measured brijk magnitudes . from these",
    "we compute stellar masses based on the methods and results outlined in bundy , ellis , conselice ( 2005 ) and bundy et al .",
    "all our stellar masses are furthermore normalised by the observed rest - frame k - band light , which is roughly at rest - frame @xmath69 , or redder , for most galaxies .",
    "we also convert these stellar masses , which are calculated in equation ( 2 ) using a salpeter imf to a chabrier imf .    the basic mass fitting method within the egs consists of fitting a grid of model seds constructed from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ( bc03 ) stellar population synthesis models , with different star formation histories .",
    "we use an exponentially declining model to characterise the star formation history , with various ages , metallicities and dust contents included .",
    "these models are parameterised by an age , and an e - folding time for parameterising the star formation history , where sfr @xmath70 .",
    "the values of @xmath71 are randomly selected from a range between 0.01 and 10 gyr , while the age of the onset of star formation ranges from 0 to 10 gyr .",
    "the metallicity ranges from 0.0001 to 0.05 ( bc03 ) , and the dust content is parametrised by @xmath72 , the effective v - band optical depth for which we use values @xmath73 .",
    "although we vary several parameters , the resulting stellar masses from our fits do not depend strongly on the various selection criteria used to characterise the age and the metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "it is important to realise that these parameterisations are fairly simple , and it remains possible that stellar mass from older stars is missed under brighter , younger , populations . while the majority of our systems are passively evolving older stellar populations , it is possible that up to a factor of two in stellar mass is missed in any star bursting blue systems .",
    "however , stellar masses measured through our technique are roughly the expected factor of 5 - 10 smaller than dynamical masses at @xmath23 using a sample of disk galaxies ( conselice et al .",
    "2005b ) , demonstrating their inherent reliability .",
    "we match magnitudes derived from these model star formation histories to the actual data to obtain a measurement of stellar mass using a bayesian approach .",
    "we calculate the likely stellar mass , age , and absolute magnitudes for each galaxy at all star formation histories , and determine stellar masses based on this distribution .",
    "distributions with larger ranges of stellar masses have larger resulting uncertainties . while parameters such as age , e - folding time , metallicity , etc . are not likely accurately fit through these calculations due to various degeneracies , the stellar mass is robust .",
    "typical errors for our stellar masses are 0.2 dex from the width of the probability distributions . there are also uncertainties from the choice of the imf .",
    "our stellar masses utilise the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "there are additional random uncertainties due to photometric errors .",
    "the resulting stellar masses thus have a total random error of 0.2 - 0.3 dex , roughly a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , there is the issue of whether or not our stellar masses are overestimated based on using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models .",
    "it has recently been argued by maraston ( 2007 ) , among others , that a refined treatment of thermal - pulsating agb stars in the bc03 models result in stellar masses that can be too high by a factor of a few . while we consider an uncertainty of a factor of two in our stellar masses , it is worth investigating whether or not our sample is in the regime where the effects of a different treatment of tp - agb stars in e.g. , maraston ( 2007 ) will influence our mass measurements .",
    "this has been investigated in maraston ( 2005 ) who have concluded that galaxy stellar masses computed with an improved treatment of tp - agb stars are roughly 50 - 60% lower .    however , the effect of tp - agb stars is less important at our rest - frame wavelengths probed than at longer wavelengths , especially in the rest - frame ir .",
    "the egs survey is k - selected , and the observed k - band is used as the flux in which stellar masses are computed .",
    "the rest - frame wavelength probed with the observed k - band ranges from 0.7@xmath74 m to 1.5@xmath74 m where the effects of tp - agb stars are minimised .",
    "the ages of our galaxies are also older than the ages where tp - agb stars have their most effect ( maraston 2005 ) . to test this , after our analysis was finished , we utilised the newer bruzual and charlot ( 2009 , in prep ) models , which include a new tp - agb star prescription , on our massive galaxy sample . from this",
    "we find on average a @xmath43 0.07 dex smaller stellar mass using the newer models . at most",
    ", the influence of tp - agb stars will decrease our stellar masses by 20% .",
    "the effect of this would decrease the number of galaxies within our sample , particularly those close to the m@xmath75 boundary .",
    "this systematic error is however much smaller than both the stellar mass error we assume ( 0.3 dex ) , and the cosmic variance uncertainties , and thus we conclude it is not a significant factor for our analysis .",
    "we use the cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) parameters to measure the structures of our @xmath2 galaxies quantitatively .",
    "we include in our analysis the measurement of the gini and 20 parameters ( e.g. , lotz et al .",
    "the cas / gini/20 parameters are a non - parametric method for measuring the forms and structures of galaxies in resolved ccd images ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000a ; bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice et al . 2002 ; conselice 2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "the basic idea behind these parameters is that galaxies have light distributions that reveal their past and present formation modes ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , well - known galaxy types in the nearby universe fall in well defined regions of the cas parameter space . for example",
    ", the selection @xmath76 locates systems which are nearly all major galaxy mergers in the nearby universe ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000b ; conselice 2003 ; hernandez - toledo et al .",
    "2005 ; conselice 2006b ) .",
    "in addition to the classic cas parameters , we also investigate the use of the similar gini and m@xmath77 parameters ( lotz et al .",
    "we give a brief description of these parameters below .",
    "the way we measure structural parameters on our hubble images varies slightly from what has been done earlier in the hubble deep field , and goods imaging ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003a ; conselice et al .",
    "2004 ) . the basic measurement procedure , after cutting out the galaxy into a smaller image , is to first measure the radius in which the parameters are computed .",
    "the radius we use for all our indices is defined by the petrosian radii , which is the radius where the surface brightness at a given radius is 20% of the surface brightness within that radius ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "we use circular apertures for our petrosian radii and quantitative parameter estimation .",
    "we begin our estimates of the galaxy centre for the radius measurement at the centroid of the galaxy s light distribution . through modelling and various tests",
    ", it can be shown that the resulting radii do not depending critically on the exact centre , although the cas and other parameters do ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ; lotz et al .",
    "the exact petrosian radius we use to measure our parameters is    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the radius where the surface brightness is 20% of the surface brightness within that radius .",
    "a very important issue , especially for faint galaxies , is how to account for background light and noise . for faint galaxies",
    "there is a considerable amount of noise added due to the sky , which must be corrected . through various test , outlined in detail in conselice et al .",
    "( 2009 , in prep ) , we conclude that the proper way to correct parameters for the background requires that the selected background area be close to the object of interest .",
    "this is only an issue for faint galaxies , and for galaxies imaged on large mosaics which have a non - uniform weight map , and whose noise characteristics vary across the field . by using a background near each object",
    "we alleviate these issues as the noise properties do not vary significantly over @xmath80 arcmin , where the galaxy and the background area are selected .",
    "we review below how the cas and gini/20 parameters are measured . for more detail",

    "the asymmetry of a galaxy is measured by taking an original galaxy image and rotating it 180 degrees about its centre , and then subtracting the two images ( conselice 1997 ) .",
    "there are corrections done for background , and radius ( explained in detail in conselice et al .",
    "most importantly , the centre for rotation is decided by an iterative process which finds the location of the minimum asymmetry .",
    "the formula for calculating the asymmetry is given by :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the original image pixels , @xmath83 is the image after rotating by 180 .",
    "the background subtraction using light from a blank sky area , called @xmath84 , are critical for this process , and must be minimised in the same way as the original galaxy itself .",
    "a lower value of @xmath85 means that a galaxy has a higher degree of rotational symmetry which tends to be found in elliptical galaxies .",
    "higher values of @xmath85 indicate an asymmetric light distribution , which are usually found in spiral galaxies , or in the more extreme case , merger candidates .",
    "concentration is a measure of the intensity of light contained within a central region in comparison to a larger region in the outer - parts of a galaxy .",
    "the exact definition is the ratio of two circular radii which contain 20% and 80% ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) of the total galaxy flux ,    @xmath88    this index is sometimes called c@xmath89 .",
    "a higher value of @xmath90 indicates that a larger amount of light in a galaxy is contained within a central region .",
    "this particular measurement of the concentration correlates well with the mass and halo properties of galaxies in the nearby universe ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; conselice 2003 ) .",
    "the clumpiness ( @xmath91 ) parameter is used to describe the fraction of light in a galaxy which is contained in clumpy distributions .",
    "clumpy galaxies have a relatively large amount of light at high spatial frequencies , whereas smooth systems , such as elliptical galaxies contain light at low spatial frequencies .",
    "galaxies which are undergoing star formation tend to have very clumpy structures , and high @xmath91 values .",
    "clumpiness can be measured in a number of ways , the most common method used , as described in conselice ( 2003 ) is ,    @xmath92,\\ ] ]    where , the original image @xmath93 is blurred to produce a secondary image , @xmath94 .",
    "this blurred image is then subtracted from the original image leaving a residual map , containing only high frequency structures in the galaxy ( conselice 2003 ) . to quantify this ,",
    "we normalise the summation of these residuals by the original galaxy s total light , and subtract from this the residual amount of sky after smoothing and subtracting it in the same way .",
    "the size of the smoothing kernel @xmath42 is determined by the radius of the galaxy , and is @xmath95 ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "note that the centres of galaxies are removed when this procedure is carried out .",
    "the gini coefficient is a statistical tool originally used in economics to determine the distribution of wealth within a population , with higher values indicating a very unequal distribution ( gini of 1 would mean all wealth / light is in one person / pixel ) , while a lower value indicates it is distributed more evenly amongst the population ( gini of 0 would mean everyone / every pixel has an equal share ) .",
    "the value of g is defined by the lorentz curve of the galaxy s light distribution , which does not take into consideration spatial position .",
    "each pixel is ordered by its brightness and counted as part of the cumulative distribution ( see lotz et al . 2004 , 2008 ) .",
    "the 20 parameter is a similar parameter to the concentration in that it gives a value that indicates whether light is concentrated within an image ; it is however calculated slightly differently .",
    "the total moment of light is calculated by summing the flux of each pixel multiplied by the square of its distance from the centre .",
    "the centre is deemed to be the location where 20 is minimised ( lotz et al 2004 ) .",
    "the value of 20 is the moment of the fluxes of the brightest 20% of light in a galaxy , which is then normalised by the total light moment for all pixels ( lotz et al .",
    "2004 , 2008 ) .",
    "this analysis is unique in several ways .",
    "first , it is based on two major data sets - the cosmos and the egs surveys .",
    "the total number of galaxies we study for our morphological analysis is also by far the largest ever published to date .",

    "2008 ) used smaller samples , and thus were able to check systematics in a way we can not due to our large sample of galaxies .",
    "the large number of galaxies in our sample makes the type of checking done in previous work largely impossible ( cf .",
    "jogee et al .",
    "2008 for this type of analysis done on the gems data set ) .",
    "the sample of galaxies in which we use from the egs is described in great detail in conselice et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , and we refer all readers to this paper for characteristics of the sample .",
    "the sample we use for the cosmos field is however not as well characterised , nor as well understood , or as accurately calibrated .",
    "we can however , investigate some basic features of the cosmos data set to determine how it compares with the better calibrated ( for our purposes ) egs data set and sample , described in conselice et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "figure  1 shows how stellar masses are distributed with redshift in the cosmos field , demonstrating some clustering features which may bias the results , if the merger history is a strong function of environment .",

    "the horizontal line represents the cut at log m@xmath96 we use in some of our analysis .",

    "the distribution within the egs for the same stellar mass range is similar ( conselice et al .",
    "2007a).,width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    the other feature through which we investigate the sample is the cas diagrams of concentration - asymmetry and asymmetry - clumpiness ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "these diagrams reveal which type of galaxies are likely to be within the sample .",
    "what we found in our initial analysis is that a significant number of systems within the cosmos field had concentration values near @xmath97 , which is typically found for stars .",
    "visual inspection of these images reveals that this is indeed the case - many stars appear to be within the released cosmos galaxy catalogs . on the other hand , our star / galaxy separation in the egs ( see conselice et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) was very effective at removing stars and no such contamination is found in the @xmath98 diagrams .",
    "we utilize the fact that stars have a well defined concentration and small measured radii to remove these systems from our cosmos cas catalog .",
    "figure  2 shows the resulting concentration - asymmetry diagram at @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the combined cosmos and egs sample .",
    "what this reveals is that there is a wide diversity of structures for galaxies at all redshifts , as shown using smaller samples in e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) and lotz et al .",
    "this includes galaxies which would be classified at @xmath12 as early types , late - types , and systems which are asymmetric enough to be ongoing major mergers ( conselice 2006a ) .",
    "one of the most interesting things concerning figure  2 is the clear bimodality of the structural parameters for these systems . at both redshifts bins ,",
    "there is a peak in the density contours near the mid / early - type range , and another peak well within the late - type range .",
    "this bimodality is present within all redshifts , and is the same bimodality found using similar structural parameters by zamojski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) within cosmos . at @xmath100",
    "we find one peak at @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and the other peak at @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "these two values of @xmath90 and @xmath85 are equivalent to early - types and late - type galaxies , and is likely similar to the bimodality found within the colour - magnitude diagram ( e.g. , the red - sequence and blue cloud ) .",
    "another interesting feature of figure  2 is that the peak location for the centres of the bimodality differs slightly with redshift , becoming less concentrated and more asymmetric at high redshift .",
    "this change is @xmath105 = 0.05 and @xmath106 = 0.2 .",
    "the peaks of the bimodality are also softer , suggesting a larger scatter about the bimodality seen at lower redshifts .",
    "the slightly lower values are in principle due solely to redshift effects , or morphological k - corrections , both of which are roughly of the order of the changes seen here .",
    "before we can effectively study the merger history for our sample , we must select a robust sample of mergers , as cleanly as possible ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "there are several ways to do this .",
    "the classical rest - frame optical cas definition for determining whether a system is undergoing a merger is given by ( conselice 2003 ) :    @xmath107    that is , the asymmetry @xmath85 must be larger than 0.35 and the asymmetry must exceed the value of the clumpiness of the galaxy .",
    "this selection will nearly always cleanly find galaxies in mergers as revealed through nearby samples of galaxies ( conselice 2003 ; de propris et al .",
    "2007 ) , and through n - body simulations of the merger process ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "tests of how well this criteria does at higher redshifts are limited to either small samples ( conselice et al .",
    "2008a ) , and to the gems survey which was based on f606w ( v ) band imaging of galaxies ( jogee et al .",
    "these studies however reveal a few features that we can use to determine how well the criteria given in equation ( 6 ) does for finding galaxies undergoing mergers .",
    "the first is that although the jogee et al .",
    "( 2008 ) study of gems uses the f606w band , at @xmath108 , it samples rest - frame optical light , as we also do for nearly all our galaxy sample . since jogee et al .",
    "( 2008 ) classify all their galaxies by eye ( which we do not ) , and use the exact same methodology and cas code as we do , we can use their analysis to determine what fraction of galaxies we are finding using criteria from eq . ( 6 ) which are actual merging galaxies .",
    "jogee et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that at their lowest redshift , the contamination by non - merging galaxies , as defined by visual inspection , is @xmath109% . a significant fraction of this 30% however are irregular galaxies , some of which could be systems in some phase of a merger .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2008a ) within the udf , found that over the entire redshift range of @xmath110 the contamination is lower , roughly 15% .",
    "these differences are likely due to the difficultly of defining what a merger is based on visual appearances .",
    "we also use the clumpiness - asymmetry diagrams of our combined sample and the concentration - asymmetry diagram discussed in  3.1 to get an idea for how well the merger criteria selects merging systems .",
    "first , we note that in paper i ( conselice et al .",
    "2008a ) the clumpiness - asymmetry relation found for normal galaxies in conselice ( 2003 ) does not do a good job in tracing the relation between asymmetry and clumpiness for normal , non - merging , galaxies . for systems at @xmath111 the clumpiness values are lower than their corresponding asymmetry .",
    "this is due to either to the structures of galaxies being actually less clumpy , or in the way the clumpiness is defined by conselice ( 2003 ) , or because of decreased resolution and s / n , the clumpiness decreases .",
    "we reevaluate the criteria for how the asymmetry and clumpiness values for normal galaxies change for galaxies at @xmath111 through the use of the hubble ultra deep field ( described in paper i ) .",

    "in figure  4 we show the relation between @xmath85 and @xmath91 for the cosmos+egs sample .",
    "as can be seen , there is a general correlation between these two parameters , with a single peak , and a distribution around @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "figure  4 also shows that the average asymmetry of these galaxies slightly increases at higher redshifts , with the clumpiness index remaining roughly the same at the peak value .    to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]    to 140 mm     from paper",

    "the merger fraction history at @xmath112 is however considered somewhat controversial , due to published values of the derived merger history differing ( e.g. , conselice et al .",

    "2003a ; conselice 2006b ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the cas method has been well calibrated in terms of the types of galaxies picked up with various selection criteria at different redshifts , as well as estimates for the time - scale sensitivity and the ability to pick up mergers with different mass ratios . in this section",

    "one factor we have to account for are the effects of redshift on the measured cas parameters of our galaxies .",
    "these effects include the lowering of surface brightness , and morphological @xmath24corrections , on the measurement of merger fractions using the cosmos and the egs data .",
    "we address these two corrections separately and quantitatively .",
    "we also discuss how to account for the contamination rate due to non - mergers within our sample .",
    "some of these issues were addressed , at least in terms of redshift effects , by kampczyk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who examined how a volume limited sample of 1813 low redshift galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey would appear at higher redshifts in the cosmos field .",

    "( 2007 ) also found that 1.7% of normal sdss galaxies would be identified as mergers due to chance superpositions .",
    "they however conclude that most of the mergers they identify by eye in cosmos at @xmath23 are real .",
    "we go beyond kampczyk in this paper in a number of ways .",
    "first we use quantitative methods that do not rely upon subjective understanding of what a merger is . because we purely use the cas system in this paper , our approach is quantitative and repeatable , and not subject to classification bias .",
    "we also quantify directly using simulations how much the parameters we measure are affected by redshift effects , not just the effects of signal to noise and resolution examined by kampczyk et al .",
    "we also note that kampczyk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that the mergers they simulate remain asymmetric , but that the gini / m@xmath77 method fails to locate 90% of their merging galaxies , similar to our findings in the hubble ultra deep field ( paper i ; conselice et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "since we use the f814w data to measure the cas values , and therefore merger fractions , of our galaxies , we are sampling different rest - frame wavelengths for galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "we address this empirically in two different ways .",
    "the first is that we can use imaging from the hubble ultra deep field , where we have bv@xmath121 imaging for all galaxies , to determine the morphological @xmath24correction present within our galaxies , as discussed in conselice et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "the other is that we can use the f606w ( v - band ) and f814w ( i - band ) data from the egs as another determination for how the morphological k - correction changes the resulting measured cas parameters .    the f814w band at observed @xmath122  results in a range of probed rest - frame wavelengths from 0.7 @xmath74 m at @xmath4 , to 0.38 @xmath74 m at @xmath25 .",
    "this spans roughly the entire optical wavelength range , where the cas parameters can slight change ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "however , these resulting changes are not large ( e.g. , taylor - mager et al . 2007 ;",
    "conselice et al .",
    "as such , we investigate the changes using galaxies in the udf , to determine how much the measured asymmetry in the f814w band changes due to the rest - frame wavelength probed .",
    "we base our measurement of the morphological @xmath24correction on how the measured cas parameters , particularly the asymmetry index , change with respect to @xmath123  . for systems at @xmath124 we utilise the results of conselice et al .",
    "( 2008a ) who find a change of asymmetry parameter with rest - frame wavelength in the optical of @xmath125 @xmath74m@xmath27 at @xmath100 . for galaxies at @xmath99 conselice et al .",

    "the effective result of this is a maximum change in the asymmetry index of @xmath127 at the highest redshifts .",
    "we perform this correction for each of our galaxies , such that we are measuring the cas parameter at the same wavelength , in this case at rest - frame @xmath123  .",
    "we find similar results when comparing the v and i band cas values within the acs imaging of the egs .",
    "another correction due to redshift is the fact that the surface brightness declines with @xmath128 , and thus the galaxies we image at @xmath23 , with the same effective surface brightness , will appear a factor of @xmath129 fainter in their measured surface brightness than at @xmath130 .",
    "we correct for this effect through simulations , as described previously in conselice ( 2003 ) and conselice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "these simulations involve nearby galaxies which are simulated to various redshifts , and their cas parameters are measured and compared with those at lower redshifts .",
    "what we find is that up to @xmath23 , the cas parameters are not affected to a large degree , and the asymmetry index declines by @xmath131 up to @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore use this as the maximum correction at @xmath23 and apply it to galaxies at @xmath132 where this effect is found to be important .",
    "the other correction we perform is to correct the cas merger fraction measures for contamination from galaxies which are within the merger region of cas space , but which are not structurally undergoing a merger ( see also  3.2 & conselice et al .",
    "the estimates of this correction must be done by eye , and the large sample in this paper makes this exercise too prohibitively large to carry out .",
    "previous studies however have revealed what this fraction is from samples of @xmath133s of galaxies ( jogee et al .",
    "2008 ; conselice et al .",
    "conselice et al .",
    "( 2008a ) find that the contamination rate is roughly 14@xmath13410% for galaxies observed in the @xmath135band ( conselice et al .",
    "other results include an examination of the cas and morphological types for @xmath136 galaxies in the gems v@xmath137 band ( jogee et al .",
    "2008 ) , which find a contamination rate of @xmath138% at @xmath139 which is rest - frame @xmath140  .",
    "since the gems survey better matches the depth and rest - frame wavelength of our images , we use a contamination correction of @xmath141 = 25% .",
    "this correction is potentially smaller than this due to the removal of ` irregular ' galaxies from jogee et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , some of which are potentially merging systems .",
    "the final measure of the asymmetry index to calculate the merger fraction is given by :    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is the ( usually negative ) morphological k - correction , @xmath144 is the ( positive ) correction for redshift effects , and @xmath141 is the fraction of galaxies found through cas which are not actually merging systems , which we take as @xmath141 = 0.25 in this paper .",
    "the first observation we derive from our cas values is the evolution of the merger fraction ( figure  5 ) for both the egs and cosmos fields separately .",
    "error bars reflect uncertainties due to shot noise , and photometric redshift errors .",
    "before we discuss the merger fraction evolution it is important to address the issue of whether our merger analysis , which finds galaxies with a high asymmetry , locates the same types of galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "a legitimate concern is that at higher redshifts , galaxies can be asymmetric due to reasons other than major mergers , such as star formation and minor mergers .",
    "certainly , we know there are differences between galaxies at various redshifts , as for example , the star formation rate at z = 1 is several times higher than it is at z = 0 .",
    "however , several detailed analyses over the past few years have shown that galaxies with high asymmetries are almost always major mergers .",
    "this includes calibrating how the asymmetry index works , not just at low redshifts ( conselice 2003 ) , but also at high redshift ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2005 , 2008a ) .",
    "these studies have found that galaxies with evidence for merging , both kinematically ( e.g. , kassin et al . 2007 ) , and through visual inspection , have high asymmetries , and likewise the non - mergers are not asymmetric .",
    "note that this is only true in optical light , as asymmetries for star forming galaxies in the rest - frame uv can be quite high , independent of any merging activity ( taylor - mager et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "it is also possible that interactions and minor mergers can produce large asymmetries .",
    "however , for reasons explained in previous papers , such as conselice ( 2006b ) and de propris et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , it is unlikely that very many asymmetric galaxies are produced through interactions or minor mergers . de propris et al .",
    "( 2007 ) examined the asymmetry values for interacting , merging , and normal galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "they found that very few of the interacting galaxies are considered mergers in the cas system , and those that would be counted are in very close pairs which are about to merge . by far the bulk of the systems with high asymmetries",
    "are found in the major merger category .",
    "this was furthermore quantified through n - body simulations by conselice ( 2006 ) who found that only major mergers with ratios of @xmath145 would be counted as a major merger within the cas system . because the asymmetry index , and the other cas values , are luminosity weight , faint features , such as tidal debris ( e.g , kawata et al .",
    "2006 ) do not produce large asymmetries .",
    "we thus determine the merger fraction for galaxies of various masses using the criteria from equation ( 6 ) and by using the asymmetries calculated in equation ( 9 ) .",
    "our final merger fraction values are tabulated in table  1 , and are separated into the egs and cosmos fields in figure  5 .",
    "figure  6 shows the merger fraction evolution for our m@xmath1 sample , with the @xmath146 point from de propris et al .",

    ".merger fractions for galaxies with m@xmath1 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that the merger fractions we measure are in no sense the total galaxy merger fraction , that is the total number of galaxies which have undergone , or are undergoing , a merger at the given time .",
    "most galaxies will have undergone a merger sometimes in their history , and the fraction of galaxies which have undergone a merger sometime in the past will be close to 100% .",
    "all merger fractions we derive in this paper are computed using the cas parameters , which is only sensitive to a well defined time - range during the major merger process ( conselice 2006 ; lotz et al",
    ". 2008b ) . in the case of cas mergers ,",
    "this time - span is roughly 0.4 - 1 gyr ( conselice 2006 ; lotz et al .",
    "as shown in conselice ( 2006 ) there are phases of a merger which will not be picked up by the cas technique .",
    "a different technique will find a different merger fraction if it has a time sensitivity different from the cas system .",
    "for example if galaxy pair methods has roughly a factor of two longer time - scale for finding a merger than the cas system , the resulting computed merger rate would be the same , as the pair method would find a factor of two more galaxies merging than the cas parameters .",
    "we therefore expect , and find there to be , galaxies that by eye appear as a merger , but do not have a high asymmetry ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "there are a few obvious features of the merger fraction that deserve note , as seen in figure  5 and 6 .",
    "the first is that at the redshifts where we have data for both the egs and cosmos , the two agree remarkably well , always within 1-@xmath42 ( see also table  1 ) .",
    "there is also a general trend for the merger fractions , as measured in both fields , to decline at lower redshifts , going from @xmath147 at @xmath5 down to @xmath148 at @xmath108 in the egs field , with a similar trend within the cosmos field .",
    "the lowest redshift point for the cosmos data at @xmath4 is slightly higher than the two nearest and higher redshift bins .",
    "this is at least partially due to the higher resolution reached at this redshift , which can result in higher computed asymmetries ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "the other obvious and outstanding feature of our measured merger history is the fact that the merger fraction , based on our measurements , declines rapidly at @xmath8 , although it appears roughly constant at @xmath149 .",
    "this result is unlikely solely due to cosmic variance , as both fields show this behaviour , and this result is relatively insensitive to the exact corrections we apply for redshifts and @xmath24corrections .",
    "this result is , within our errors , significant at @xmath150-@xmath42 , based on the combined egs+cosmos sample .",
    "we also fit these two redshift ranges in the egs+cosmos merger fraction evolution separately , as shown in figure  6 by the two dashed lines .",

    "there are a few popular ways to fit the merger fraction evolution .",
    "the first is the traditional power - law format ( patton et al .",
    "2002 ; conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; bridge et al .",
    "2007 ) which dates back to early work by zepf & koo ( 1989 ) on the evolution of the merger fraction .",
    "this fitting format is given by ,    @xmath170    where @xmath171 is the merger fraction at a given redshift , @xmath163 is the merger fraction at @xmath12 , and @xmath19 is the power - law index for characterising the merger fraction evolution .",
    "zepf & koo ( 1989 ) calculated a merger fraction evolution which increased with redshift up to @xmath172 , and obtained a slope of @xmath173 .",
    "nearly all further studies have found values within this range .",
    "however there is currently a debate over the true nature of the increase , with some studies finding a fast evolution ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; kartaltepe et al .",
    "2007 ) , while others have found a more modest evolution ( e.g. , lotz et al . 2008a",
    "; lin et al . 2008 ) .",
    "there are several reasons for this diversity in the parameterisation of the merger fraction evolution , which we discuss after demonstrating the various ways the merger fraction evolution can be fit within our own sample .",
    "we explore below the power - law behaviour of the merger fraction evolution in a few ways .",
    "the first method is to investigate the power - law fit to the merger fractions solely within the cosmos+egs data set ( figure  5 ) .",
    "when we fit a power - law to this evolution using just the points from cosmos+egs at @xmath3 we find a best fit given by @xmath174 and @xmath11 .",
    "that is , internal to itself , the cas merger fraction from @xmath4 to @xmath5 increases modestly with time .",
    "note that the derived merger fraction at @xmath12 for this sample is 0.025@xmath175 which is about a factor of three larger than the @xmath12 merger fraction derived from de propris et al .",
    "when we hold the @xmath15 point at a constant value of @xmath176 we find that the best - fit slope for cosmos+egs data increases to @xmath13 .",
    "our derived evolution is similar to the results found by lotz et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , whose merger fractions are similar to ours ( figure  7 ) .",
    "our merger fraction evolution power - law slope , @xmath19 , is however smaller than the index @xmath19 measured by kartaltepe et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using pair counts .",
    "even though kartaltepe et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find in general lower pair fractions compare to our merger fractions , the increase with time is more pronounced , and they derive an index of @xmath177 .",

    "( 2007 ) points with the same @xmath12 prior we use for the egs+cosmos data , we find that the best fit slope is @xmath1780.1 . when we remove the @xmath15 prior in this fit , we find that the slope changes to @xmath179 , although most of this is driven by the high redshift points from kartaltepe et al .",

    ", width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    overall , we find that the value of @xmath19 can vary significantly depending on what value of @xmath163 is chosen .",
    "for example ,",
    "if the @xmath12 merger fraction for log m@xmath182 galaxies is twice as high as the de propris et al .",
    "value ( i.e. , @xmath183 ) then the best fit value of the power - law slope changes from @xmath13 to @xmath184 , thus raising the @xmath12 merger fraction lowers the value of the power - law slope . if we hold the @xmath15 merger fraction as 4% , then we find that the power - law slope falls to @xmath185 .",
    "note that this does not appear to be the case for very massive galaxies with m@xmath165 ( bluck et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "since the @xmath15 merger fraction can be critically important for deriving the merger history if it is used as a prior , it is worth examining what the merger fraction at @xmath15 is , and how certain we know this number .",
    "we also have some estimates of what the local merger fraction is from previous work such as patton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and de propris et al .",
    "we use the millennium galaxy catalog ( mgc ) selection for mergers , which is based on systems which are at @xmath186 , and thus a complete comparison is not possible without measuring the stellar masses for these galaxies .",
    "de propris et al . ( 2007 ) find that the merger fraction at @xmath187 , is @xmath188 , based on the cas asymmetry .",
    "by holding the value of @xmath163 fixed to 0.009 , we fit a power - law slope of @xmath13 .",
    "however , this is not a good fit to the data ( figure  6 ) , and tends to under - predict the merger fraction at @xmath189 and over - predict the fraction at @xmath190 .",
    "one of the features of the derived merger fraction up to @xmath5 is that between various neighboring redshifts there are significant differences in the derived merger fraction ( figures  5 - 7 ) .",
    "this is true for the combined egs+cosmos sample , the egs and cosmos samples alone , and is also found for the gini / m@xmath77 approach in lotz et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , as well as the pair method derived in kartaltepe et al .",
    "in fact , the slope of the power - law merger fraction evolution ranges from @xmath191 to @xmath192 between two neighboring individual merger fractions .",
    "it is not yet clear what the origin of these differences are , whether the result of cosmic variance , or systematics .",
    "however on average the merger fraction does increase slightly with time up to @xmath5 (  3.3.3 ) .",
    "we do a similar examination of the best power - law fit to the merger fraction evolution by including higher redshift merger fractions taken from a combined udf+hdf sample ( conselice et al .",
    "2008a ) selected with the same stellar mass cut of m@xmath1 .",
    "the resulting merger fraction evolution is shown in figure  6 , which is currently our best estimate of how the merger fraction varies with time for a mass selected sample .",
    "when we fit the merger fraction evolution for m@xmath1 galaxies from @xmath12 to @xmath14 we find that the best fit using all points , and no priors , is : @xmath193 and @xmath194 , although this power - law fit is poor , and the @xmath195 is large .",
    "if we hold the value of @xmath176 , we find that the best fit value of the power - law slope increases to @xmath196 , although this does not go through the highest redshift point , and results in a poor fit .",
    "however , the @xmath12 extrapolation from the best fit to all the data predicts that the nearby merger fraction is roughly twice the best value we currently have .",
    "this again demonstrates the importance of the value of @xmath163 within the power - law fit .",
    "the value of @xmath163 determines to a large degree what the fitted slope of the power - law evolution will be , especially if the value is held constant during the fit .",
    "another way to characterise the merger fraction evolution , which dates back to theoretical arguments based on the press - schechter formalism for merging ( carlberg 1990 ) , is a combined power - law exponential evolution .",
    "this form appears to be a better fit to all of the redshift data than a simple power - law ( conselice 2006b ) .",
    "this is however not the case for the merger fraction for m@xmath165 galaxies at @xmath18 , which can be fit by a power - law ( bluck et al .",
    "the formula for the power - law / exponential evolution is given by :    @xmath197    where the @xmath12 merger fraction is given by @xmath198 exp(@xmath199 ) .",
    "we find in general that this combined exponential power - law fit is better than a simple power - law and is likely a better representation for how the merger fraction evolves with time .",
    "we also find this to be the case for a power - law / exponential form , without the square on the @xmath200 term in the exponential .",
    "however , none of these forms are very satisfying , given the large errors on their fits , and the three free parameters needed to create the fit .    as discussed in paper ii ( conselice et al .",
    "2009 , submitted ) there does not appear to be a simple way to parameterise the merger fraction .",
    "we explored several fitting routines , and found that the best - fit two parameter model is an exponential / power - law of the form :    @xmath201    which is designed such that @xmath202 , and is only a two parameter parameterisation , and fits the data as well as the three parameter model above . in any case",
    ", we have found that the fitting with the exponential / power - law and the carlberg ( 1990 ) version of the exponential / power - law , gives an exponent on the power - law portion of @xmath194 .",
    "this is the index predicted for how the number densities of galaxies decline with redshift , and is therefore the natural exponent on the power - law for a passive merger evolution , which appears to occur at @xmath8 .",
    "one of the results we derive from our measured structural mergers is how the derived merger fractions , based on the cas and other methods ( such as gini / m@xmath77 ) , compare with derived pair fractions .",
    "figure  7 shows this comparison , with the morphological methods ( this work & lotz et al .",
    "2008a ) shown in red , and the pair methods ( kartaltepe et al . 2007 ; lin et al .",
    "2008 ; de ravel et al .",
    "2008 ) shown in blue .",
    "what is immediately clear is that the structural methods , while agreeing quite well with each other , find a higher merger fraction than the pair methodology .",
    "there are several possible reasons for this .    while it is possible that one or both methods have systematics that result in inaccurately measured merger fractions , we first investigate what the time - scales for these methods are .",
    "this is an important question as these fractions differing can be partially , or entirely , explained if the time - scales for merging for the two methodologies are different .",
    "for example , if the time - scale for a 20 kpc pair to merge is half the time - scale sensitivity for an asymmetric galaxy , then we would expect the pair fraction to be half of the cas merger fraction if both methods are tracing the same merger process . that is , the merger fraction for a given sample scales as the time - scale sensitivity of the method used to find mergers .",
    "since the merger rates for the two methods should give the same result , then the ratio of the pair fraction to its merger timescale should be equal to the structural merger fraction divided by its time - scale , or :    @xmath203    time - scales ( @xmath71 ) within the merger process are notoriously difficult to measure , and have large uncertainties .",
    "initially , measuring the merger rate from pairs involved dynamical friction calculations ( e.g. , patton et al .",
    "2002 ; conselice 2006 ) , and typical time - scales for a 20 kpc pair to merge are 0.5 - 1 gyr with various assumptions .",
    "the time - scale calculation for dynamical friction used by conselice ( 2006b ) , and in earlier studies are based on isothermal mass distributions and the time - scale can depend highly on the mass of the galaxies , and the characteristic velocity of the system ( e.g. , conselice 2006b , eq .",
    "likewise , the time - scales for merging within the cas system for dark matter dominated galaxies was found to be similar to the dynamical friction time - scales derived from an isothermal profile , and a galaxy with mass of @xmath204 .",
    "there are however problems with both of these calculations , which have already been alluded to above for the dynamical friction time - scale .",
    "the measured time - scales for the cas method are found by conselice ( 2006 ) to vary between @xmath205 gyr , depending on viewing angle and the orbital parameters of the two galaxies in the pair . also , the simulations used in conselice ( 2006 ) are purely dark matter , and it is desirable to determine the cas time - scale for systems with stars , star formation , and dust .",

    "while it is likely that even within the same sample , the cas and pair methods will find galaxies in different modes of evolution ( de propris et al .",
