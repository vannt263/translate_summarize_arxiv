    "randomness and heterogeneity govern majority of real world processes . indeed , materials which are considered as macroscopically homogeneous usually display heterogeneity across multiple scales , e.g. defects in crystalline or quasi - crystalline lattice , imperfect or entirely random particle packings , random distribution of pores or inclusions , etc .",
    "@xcite . regarding the incorporation of morphological information in multiscale simulations , it has progressed namely through a unit cell definition for heterogeneous materials exhibiting locally periodic arrangement of constituents  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the unit cell approach has also penetrated into the framework of random microstructures , namely due to the lack of an appropriate alternative , e.q .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , we thus bring a generalization to the single unit cell concept that is based on wang tiles and tailored especially for computer simulations of disordered material systems .",
    "the concept of wang tiles was introduced by hao wang in 1961 as a method to decide whether a certain class of logical statements can be proven by means of axioms of mathematical logic encoded in planar patterns  @xcite . afterwards , a focus was on the discovery of a finite set of tiles that could tile the infinite plane aperiodically in order to find counterexamples to wang s decidability conjecture on statements mirrored in periodic sets .",
    "the first result in this direction was obtained by berger in 1966 , who established a relation between aperiodic wang tilings and the turing - davis halting problem and introduced the first finite aperiodic set consisting of 20,426 tiles  @xcite , reduced to 104 later on  @xcite .",
    "further developments were brought by amman  @xcite , who originated the discovery of the set of 16 tiles , and by culik and kari  @xcite , who scored 13 .",
    "kari and culik also introduced an extension to three dimensions by means of wang cubes  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the strictly aperiodic constructions , tile sets that are not aperiodic themselves may allow for aperiodic tilings in a stochastic sense .",
    "this was first recognized by cohen  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used wang tiles to produce irregular patterns for purposes of computer graphics as an extension of stam s seminal idea based on aperiodic amman s set  @xcite .",
    "conforming edge information of wang tiles was also instrumental in syntheses of biological motifs .",
    "in particular , the tiles were exploited for the assembly of dna double - crossover molecules with edges playing the role of peptide bonds according to the watson - crick molecular complementarity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the motifs based on dna branched junctions were used together with tiles for self - assembly of aperiodic scaffolds in order to produce devices or specifically structured nanometre grids  @xcite .",
    "wang tiles have also found use in statistical physics . to name a few ,",
    "amman s set was used for the modelling of nucleation of a metastable quasicrystalline phase  @xcite whose formation depends on the cooling rate of the alloy melt  @xcite .",
    "the model was based on the thermodynamics of wang tilings studied earlier by leuzzi  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .    as for the micromechanics of materials ,",
    "the application of wang tiles to the compression of geometry of particulate suspensions was proposed in  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the tiles carry microstructural patterns designed to minimize a difference between spatial statistics of a target system and the reconstructed media .",
    "preliminary results for tiles carrying patterns of mechanical fields were reported in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we further examine the potential of wang tiles in compression of real world material systems . to this goal ,",
    "tiles whose design rests on image fusion techniques  @xcite are investigated and combined with statistics arguments in order to determine optimal setting of design parameters .",
    "the methodology is demonstrated on microstructural patterns of the media with uniformly distributed equi - sized hard and soft discs , sandstone , and closed cell aluminium foam alporas^^. the proximity of synthesized microstructures to reference specimens is quantified by means of the one- and two - point probability functions , and the two - point cluster function .",
    "techniques combined in the present paper originate from various fields . a brief overview of relevant basics",
    "is given first as their omission would make the paper difficult reading .",
    "basic elements of the concept are wang ( i ) tiles , ( ii ) tile sets , and ( iii ) tilings .",
    "wang tile is a square , jigsaw - like , quatrominoe piece capable of carrying arbitrary microstructural patterns within its entire domain including edges  @xcite .",
    "it is not allowed to be rotated or reflected when placed into a tiling , so that the tiles with an identical sequence of edges mutually rotated by @xmath0 where @xmath1 are considered different .",
