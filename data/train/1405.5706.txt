    "the present paper deals with several questions concerning irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds and their automorphisms .",
    "all known examples of irreducible symplectic manifolds arise from symplectic surfaces , often as moduli spaces of sheaves on these surfaces .",
    "the easiest such example is the hilbert scheme of @xmath3 points on a @xmath1 surface , constructed by beauville in @xcite .",
    "this kind of construction allows to produce several examples of automorphisms on irreducible symplectic manifolds , simply by taking a @xmath1 surface with non - trivial automorphism group and considering the induced action on its hilbert scheme .",
    "these kinds of automorphisms are called _ natural _ and were studied by beauville @xcite , boissire @xcite and many others .",
    "very few examples of non - natural automorphisms are known , such as those constructed in @xcite , and a numerical criterion to distinguish between natural and non - natural automorphisms is available only in special cases , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to provide a generalisation of the notion of natural automorphisms .",
    "this notion appeared the first time for moduli spaces of sheaves in the paper @xcite , a work inspired by the beautiful construction in ( * ? ? ? * sect .",
    "we extend the ideas drastically using recent developments in the theory of stability conditions by bridgeland @xcite by bayer and macr ( @xcite and @xcite ) and yoshioka @xcite .",
    "this new notion of _ induced _ automorphisms includes all automorphisms on moduli spaces of stable objects , where the action is induced from an automorphism of the underlying surface .",
    "we provide a numerical criterion for the recognition of such examples and we apply this general framework to construct several new examples of induced , yet non - natural automorphisms . in particular , we prove the following :    let @xmath4 be a manifold of @xmath0}$]-type , and let @xmath5 be a group of non - symplectic automorphisms .",
    "assume that the action of @xmath6 fixes a copy of @xmath7 inside @xmath8 , then there exists a @xmath1 surface @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , @xmath4 is a moduli space of stable objects on @xmath9 and the action of @xmath6 on @xmath4 is induced by that on @xmath9 .",
    "see *   [ thm : k3n_induced ] * for the proof and a more precise statement .",
    "the same technique can be applied also to symplectic automorphisms , but in this case we obtain a more general result :    the moduli space of pairs @xmath11 with @xmath4 irreducible symplectic , @xmath5 symplectic and @xmath12 fixed up to conjugation has at most the same number of connected components as the moduli space of marked pairs @xmath13 .    see *   [ thm : sympl_def ] * for details .",
    "we mainly apply the new technique to automorphisms which do not preserve the symplectic form ( i.e.  non - symplectic automorphisms ) : in the recent work of boissire , camere and sarti ( @xcite ) a lattice - theoretic classification of non - symplectic automorphisms of prime order ( different from @xmath14 ) is given in the case of manifolds of @xmath2}$]-type .",
    "the case of involutions is of special interest since it provides a great number of automorphisms of irreducible symplectic manifolds , where , up to now , no geometric realisation is known . using the notion of induced automorphisms we can realise almost all the unknown examples as automorphisms on moduli spaces of sheaves .",
    "some examples are provided using degenerations of double epw - sextics . we therefore have the following :    aside from @xmath15 cases , there is a geometric realisation for every family of non - symplectic prime order ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) automorphisms on manifolds of @xmath2}$]-type .",
    "almost all families correspond to induced automorphisms .",
    "a few more results concerning automorphisms are included , in particular we have the following for lagrangian fibrations with a section .",
    "let @xmath4 be a manifold of @xmath0}$]-type having a lagrangian fibration with a section .",
    "then @xmath18 admits a primitive embedding of @xmath19 if @xmath3 is odd , and of @xmath20 otherwise .",
    "see *   [ prop : lagr_lattice ] * for the proof and the following statements for analogous results on other irreducible symplectic manifolds .",
    "in particular we can exploit the above to prove that there exist lagrangian fibrations which can not be deformed to fibrations having a section . + the structure of the paper is as follows : in *   [ sec : prel ] * , we gather all preliminaries concerning lattice theory , irreducible symplectic manifolds and stability conditions . in *",

    "is provided , which is proven to hold in the case that @xmath21 is a prime power .",
    "the case of symplectic automorphisms is treated in its full generality . in *   [ sec : kieran_case ] * , we discuss the notion of induced automorphisms on the two manifolds introduced by ogrady .",
    "finally , in *   [ sec : appl ] * we apply the theoretical construction to the recent work of boissire , camere and sarti @xcite to explicitly construct all non - symplectic automorphisms of prime order ( different from @xmath14 ) on manifolds of @xmath2}$]-type , apart from three cases .",
    "moreover , we analyse lagrangian fibrations with a section together with the involution which is naturally induced by this section .    in this article",
