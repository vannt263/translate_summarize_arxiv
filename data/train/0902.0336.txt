    "developing a large sample of low metallicity galaxies is of considerable interest for clues it can provide to the early stages of galaxy formation and chemical enrichment  such as whether forming galaxies have a baseline metallicity that reflects the early chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the most metal - poor systems currently known are the low redshift blue compact emission - line galaxies such as i zw 18 and sbs 0335 - 052w with measured 12+log ( o / h ) of @xmath6 ( @xcite ) . however ,",
    "despite enormous efforts , only a few dozen xmpgs ( objects with ( 12+log ( o / h ) @xmath7 or @xmath8 ; @xcite ) are known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are too few of these for detailed studies of the metallicity distribution function .    in the first paper of the present series we showed that large samples of low metallicity objects can be found by searching for ultra - strong emission - line galaxies ( usels ) using very deep narrowband surveys @xcite .",
    "the narrowband method has many advantages ; it is an efficient way to develop very large samples of objects and , since it probes to much deeper line - flux limits than objective prism or continuum surveys , we can study populations out to near redshift @xmath9 where the cosmic star formation rates peak .    in the present work we report on the detailed spectroscopic follow - up of the catalog of 542 usel galaxies given in @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sample was chosen from a set of narrowband images obtained with the suprimecam mosaic ccd camera on the subaru 8.2-m using two @xmath10120   ( fwhm ) filters centered at nominal wavelengths of 8150    and 9140    in regions of low sky background between the oh bands .",
    "the total covered area is 0.5 square degrees .",
    "the catalog consists of all objects with narrow band magnitudes less than 25 and a narrow band excess of 0.8 magnitudes for the 8150    filter and of 1.0 magnitudes in the 9140    filter compared to their respective reference continuum bands .",
    "the sample should contain all galaxies in the fields with observed frame equivalent widths significantly greater than 120  and 180  in the two filters , and with line fluxes above @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts have now been obtained for 299 of these galaxies using multi - object masks with the deimos spectrograph @xcite on the 10-m keck ii telescope .",
    "the observations , flux calibration , and equivalent width measurements are discussed in @xmath14 , where the resulting measured line ratios are also described . in @xmath15",
    "we analyse the metallicities and describe an empirical relation for the metallicity as a function of the r23 parameter , which we compare with low redshift determinations of the relation .",
    "the distribution of metallicities as a function of the properties of the galaxies is given in @xmath16 where we also compare the results with those in magnitude selected samples at the same redshift . in @xmath17 we show that the results can be used to place upper limits on the lyman alpha emitter ( lae ) luminosity function in the @xmath1 redshift range , and compare this both with the local galex measurement of @xcite and with higher redshift lae functions .",
    "a final summary discussion is given in @xmath18 .",
    "we use a standard @xmath19 = 70 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath20 = 0.3 , @xmath21 = 0.7 cosmology throughout the paper .    , width=297 ]",
    "@xcite reported spectroscopic observations for 161 usels from their sample .",
    "these spectra were obtained using the deep extragalactic imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; @xcite ) on the keck  ii 10-m telescope in a series of runs between 2003 and 2006 . over the 2007 and 2008 period",
    "we have roughly doubled this spectroscopic sample and have also significantly deepened the spectra of many of the objects that had previously been observed .    in order to provide the widest possible wavelength coverage the observations",
    "were primarily made with the zd600 @xmath22/mm grating .",
    "we used @xmath23 wide slitlets which in this configuration give a resolution is 4.5  , sufficient to distinguish the [ o]@xmath23727 doublet structure .",
    "this allows us to easily identify [ o]@xmath23727 emitters where often the [ o]@xmath23727 doublet is the only emission feature . the spectra cover a wavelength range of approximately 5000    with an average central wavelength of @xmath24   , though the exact wavelength range for each spectrum depends on the slit position with respect to the center of the mask along the dispersion direction .",
    "the observations were not generally taken at the parallactic angle , since this was determined by the mask orientation , so considerable care must be taken in measuring line fluxes , as we discuss below .",
    "each @xmath25  hr exposure was broken into three subsets , with the objects stepped along the slit by @xmath26 in each direction .",
    "some usels were observed multiple times , resulting in total exposure times of up to @xmath27 hours .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were reduced following the procedure described in @xcite and the final one - dimensional spectra were extracted using a profile weighting based on the strongest emission line in the spectrum .",
    "our primary goal was to obtain a nearly complete set of spectra for the 200 objects in the catalog with narrow - band magnitudes brighter than 24 , since , for these brighter objects , we can obtain high quality spectra suitable for detailed analysis .",
    "however , we also observed a large number of the galaxies with magnitudes in the 24 - 25 range .",
    "we have now observed 171 of the galaxies brighter than 24 .",
    "nearly all of the bright emission line candidates which were observed were identified ( 164 of the 171 objects )",
    ". however , three of the objects in the sample are stars where the absorption line structure mimics emission in the band .",

    "[ redshift_hist],width=326 ]    the narrow - band emission - line selection produces a mixture of objects corresponding to h@xmath5 , [ o]@xmath25007 , and [ o]@xmath23727 and , at the faintest magnitudes ( @xmath31 ) , high redshift ( @xmath32 ) ly@xmath5 emitters .",
    "there are almost no high redshift lyman alpha emitters at magnitudes brighter than 24 .",
    "the distribution of the redshifts for objects other than the laes is shown in figure  [ redshift_hist ] .",
    "the largest fraction of objects corresponds to cases where the [ o]@xmath25007 line lies in the narrow band filters . for the present work only the objects selected in [ o ]  or h@xmath5 are of interest ,",
    "since we can not determine the metallicities or the balmer line strengths of the [ o ]  selected samples without futher near infrared spectroscopy .",
    "our final sample of galaxies therefore consists of 214 galaxies with redshifts between zero and one of which 189 are chosen with [ o ]  and 25 with h@xmath5 .",
    "125 of these have narrow band magnitudes brighter than ab=24 .",
    "generally our spectra were not obtained at the parallactic angle since this is determined by the deimos mask orientation required to maximize object placement in slits over the entire mask field .",
    "therefore , flux calibration using standard stars is problematic because of atmospheric refraction effects , and special care must be taken for the flux calibration .",
    "a much more extensive discussion can be found in @xcite but here we focus only on measurements of the relative line fluxes from the spectra which we require for the metallicity measurements .     and h@xmath33 lines .",

    "[ sample_spectrum],title=\"fig:\",width=326 ]    the spectra were initially relatively calibrated using the measured instrument response .",
    "portions of the spectra of the two lowest metallicity galaxies in the sample are shown in figures  [ sample_spectrum_one ] and [ sample_spectrum ] .",
    "relative line fluxes can be robustly measured from the spectra without flux calibration as long as we restrict the line measurements to short wavelength ranges where the deimos response is essentially constant .",
    "for example , one can assume that the responses of neighboring lines ( e.g. [ o]@xmath24959 and [ o]@xmath25007 ) are the same and therefore one can measure the flux ratio without calibration .",
    "the present problem is considerably simplified by the presence of the h@xmath33 line near [ o]@xmath24959 and [ o]@xmath25007 ( figure  [ sample_spectrum_one](b ) and figure  [ sample_spectrum](a ) ) and the h@xmath34 line near [ o]@xmath24363 ( figure  [ sample_spectrum_one](c ) and figure  [ sample_spectrum](b ) ) . for these lines , and also for the [ n]@xmath26584 line ( figure  [ sample_spectrum_one](a ) ) we can therefore use the balmer line ratios to provide extinction corrected flux ratios for the metal lines . to calibrate these lines , we used neighboring balmer lines with the assumption of case b recombination conditions .",
    "we can not so easily do this near [ o]@xmath23727 where the balmer lines are weak and in some cases contaminated ( figure  [ sample_spectrum_one](d ) and figure  [ sample_spectrum](c ) ) .",
    "fortunately the [ o]@xmath23727 is generally extremely weak in the spectra and the uncertainty in the calibration has little effect on the metal determination .    for each spectrum we fitted a standard set of lines . for the stronger lines we used a full gaussian fit together with a linear fit to the continuum baseline .",
    "for weaker lines we held the full width constant using the value measured in the stronger lines and set the central wavelength to the nominal redshifted value . the [ o]@xmath23727 line",
    "was fitted with two gaussians with the appropriate wavelength separation .",
    "we also measured the noise as a function of wavelength by fitting to random positions in the spectrum and computing the dispersion in the results .",
    "the [ n]@xmath26584/h@xmath5 , [ o]@xmath25007/h@xmath33 , and [ o]@xmath23727/[o]@xmath25007 ratios are shown as a function of the narrow band magnitude in the selection filter in figure  [ flux - ratios ] .",
    "the population is relatively uniform in its line properties .",
    "nearly all of the galaxies have weak [ n]/h@xmath5 , ( a median ratio of 0.02 ) , weak [ o]@xmath23727 relative to [ o]@xmath25007 , ( a median ratio of 0.22 ) , and strong [ o]@xmath25007/h@xmath33 , ( a median ratio of 5.2 ) .",
    "there seems to be little difference between the h@xmath5 selected population ( shown with purple diamonds in figure  [ flux - ratios]b ) and the [ o]selected population ( shown with black squares ) .",
    "the very weak [ n ]  lines , in combination with the very strong [ o ] , show that these galaxies are not excited by active galactic nuclei , and that the galaxies have very high ionization parameters and low metallicity , as we shall quantify in the next section .",
    "the spectra are of variable quality , reflecting the range of magnitudes and exposure times , and , in order to measure the metallicities , we need very high signal to noise observations .",
    "it is also important that the balmer lines are well detected since our flux calibrations rely on the neighboring balmer lines .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to emitters whose h@xmath34 line fluxes are detected above the ten sigma level . among the 25",
    "h@xmath5 selected emitters in our total spectroscopic sample there are 8 sources with spectra of sufficient quality for the metallicity analysis , and among the 189 sources selected using [ o]@xmath25007 there are 23 such sources , giving a total sample of 31 sources for the metallicity analysis .    as we illustrate in figure  [ o3t_plot ] ,",

    "this allows us to construct a upper bound on the complete lae sample to a fixed ly@xmath5 equivalent width which can then be compared to the local and high redshift population in detail .",
    "as is well known , the short path length to optical scattering on neutral hydrogen ensures that lyman alpha photons follow a complex escape from a galaxy . while the low metallicity and extinction of the present usel sample are clearly positive indicators of a higher ly@xmath5 escape fraction they are by no means the only factor .",
    "internal structure , kinematics , and the distribution of star formation sites may also play key roles and may in fact be the more critical determinants .",
    "we take the case b ratio of @xmath75 for the ly@xmath5/h@xmath5 flux , depending on the electron density , to be an upper bound on the line ratio @xcite ( though we note that it is possible to have geometries in which the scattering can enhance the ly@xmath5 line relative to the uv continuum @xcite . )",

    "the higher redshift @xmath77 sample will contain all laes above 20  for the case b assumption .",
    "however , empirical estimates of the ly@xmath5 escape fraction in the high redshift lae population made by comparing star formation rates estimated from the uv continuum with those from the ly@xmath5 line suggest escape fractions of 30 - 50% @xcite . if this lower ratio is applicable for the ratio of the ly@xmath5/h@xmath5 fluxes .",
    "then all laes will be included in the present samples , though objects close to the h@xmath5 limiting equivalent width will fall from the lae sample .",
    "the lae sample is therefore a subset of the present sample and we can directly obtain an upper bound on the lae luminosity function from the usel h@xmath5 luminosity function .",
    "the sample is small but it provides a first - cut estimate of the evolution of the lae luminosity function .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  15 where we show the @xmath71 and the @xmath70 lae luminosity functions that would be derived from our h@xmath5 sample under the assumption ly@xmath5/h@xmath5@xmath72 for objects with rest frame ly@xmath5 equivalent widths above 20 .",
    "the @xmath71 lae luminosity function cam be compared with the direct determinations of the lae luminosity function at this redshift from the galex observations of @xcite which are shown with the open red diamonds .",
    "the galex data only contain objects with strong uv continuum detections and these correspond to the highest luminosity emitters . in this sense",
    "they parallel the high redshift lyman break galaxies with strong lyman alpha emission rather than the line selected lae samples . @xcite",
    "estimated that there should be a large incompleteness correction to allow for this selection effect and the solid red diamonds show their incompleteness corrected luminosity function . however , the present data , even under the case b assumption , suggest that the incompleteness corrections at the low luminosity end are smaller than the @xcite estimate .",
    "( we recall that the present data provide an absolute upper limit for the case b assumption . ) the present @xmath71 sample has too small a volume to probe the high luminosity end .    at high redshifts",
    "the lae luminosity function is surprisingly invariant in the range @xmath78  but there are signs it begins to drop at both higher and lower redshift .",

    "[ lf_comp ] we show the most recent determination of the @xmath73 lae luminosity function from @xcite . in order to match the present data the lae luminosity function would have to drop by about a factor of four between @xmath73 and @xmath70 ( dashed red line ) and by a factor of very roughly twenty between @xmath73 and @xmath71 ( dotted red line ) . even under the case",
    "b assumption these drops would be two and ten respectively .",
    "the drop in the lae luminosity fuction parallels the drop in the star formation over this redshift interval and there is even a suggestion of donwsizing in the shape of the lae lf at the lowest redshift which is deficient in high luminosity objects relative to the low luminosity end .",
    "we have described the results of deep spectroscopic observations of a narrow band selected sample of extreme emission line objects .",
    "the results show that such objects are common in the @xmath1 redshift interval and that a very large fraction of the strong emitters are detected in the [ o]@xmath24363 line where oxygen abundances can be measured using the direct method .",
    "the abundances primarily lie in the 12+log(o / h ) range of 7@xmath368 characteristic of xmpgs .",

    "we give an emprical relation between r23 and 12 + log(o / h ) which differs from local estimates .",
    "we also show that low metallicity objects can be picked out by the weakness of [ o]@xmath23727/[o]@xmath25007 in the spectra .",
    "the two lowest metallicity galaxies in the sample have 12 + log(o / h ) = @xmath79 and @xmath80 , making them among the lowest metallicity galaxies known , but we expect that as the sample size is increased yet lower metallicity galaxies may be found and that we may hope to be able to determine if there is a floor in the galaxy metallicity at these redshifts .",
