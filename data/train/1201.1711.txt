    "similar attractive forces are created by the dynamically polarised background medium giving rise to the cooper pairing of electrons .",
    "an excellent test system for many - particle correlations and structure formation with pronounced streaming and wake effects are complex ( dusty ) plasmas @xcite . in the plasma bulk of an radio - frequency ( rf ) discharge , where the plasma flow is negligible , spherical 3d plasma crystals ( yukawa balls ) with a nested shell structure",
    "have been created  @xcite .",
    "a completely different type of dust structure is observed in the regime of supersonic ion flow , @xmath4 . in the plasma sheath region , where strong electric fields are present , the grains form vertically aligned ` dust molecules ' and , with the help of a confining potential , long particle strings can be created , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the vertical alignment of particles is not explainable with a purely repulsive grain interaction .",
    "therefore , it was recognized early that the highly charged grains have a focusing effect on the streaming ions and a positive ion space charge is accumulated in the wake below the grains  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the existence of an attractive wake potential and a resulting non - reciprocal grain interaction was demonstrated by means of laser manipulation experiments on particle strings  @xcite and dust molecules  @xcite .    while the two limiting cases ( yukawa balls and flow - aligned dust strings ) have been explored experimentally and theoretically in great detail ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite and references therein , a key question has to our knowledge not been addressed so far : how does the structural order transition proceed between both limits when the ion flow is gradually increased and wake effects increasingly take charge ? experimentally , this question may be hard to answer since the ion - streaming velocity is neither directly accessible nor separately tunable without changing other plasma parameters at the same time .",
    "therefore , computer simulations may help to answer these questions .",
    "however , a self - consistent numerical simulation of a nonideal multi - component plasma in non - equilibrium is highly challenging due to the drastic differences in the time scales of the plasma constituents : electrons , positively charged ions , neutral atoms , and negatively charged ` dust ' grains of micrometer size . utilizing the ` dynamical screening approach ' ( dsa ) this multiscale problem can",

    ", the dust dynamics will be studied by first principle langevin dynamics simulations , which allow for a full dynamic treatment of the dust pair interaction .",
    "this article is outlined as follows : in section [ grainpot ] the dsa is employed to incorporate the dynamical screening properties of the streaming plasma background into an effective electrostatic potential of a single grain . in section [ dds ]",

    "the simulations reveal that even a relatively moderate ion - flow initiates an abrupt melting of the highly ordered ( equilibrium ) many - particle state .",
    "the observed , abrupt melting process resembles a non - equilibrium phase transition . with further increase of the ion flow ,",
    "the delocalized grains start to form flow - aligned complexes : doublets , triplets , and longer particle strings . for @xmath2 , a re - entrance into a strongly coupled , non - equilibrium many - particle state consisting of several ( oscillating ) chains is observed .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this non - equilibrium phenomenon by means of the vertical order parameter shows that the order process appears in the same @xmath0-range for clusters of different size . since the underlying , wake - induced",
    ", order mechanism is of local nature , we expect a similar ion - focus induced order transition to appear in similar form also in unconfined macroscopic systems .",
    "since dusty plasmas are often considered as a test system for many - particle correlations , the finding that even weak streaming can trigger unexpected many - particle behavior , may be of relevance also for other fields of physics .",
    "for instance , in warm dense matter physics , electron streaming effects are often neglected in the theoretical description . using a quantum ( e.g , mermin ) dielectric function , the dds scheme can be directly applied also to quantum systems  @xcite .",
