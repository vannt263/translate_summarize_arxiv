    "because of the extraordinarily large effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations , cscucl@xmath0 ( with nel temperature@xcite @xmath4k and zero  temperature saturation field @xmath5 t ) ranks among the most interesting of these compounds ; the surprises began 20 years ago@xcite and continue still , in theory as well as in experiment .",
    "the magnetic properties of cscucl@xmath0 are due to the cu@xmath6 ions ( @xmath7 ) ; these form a stacked triangular lattice , to a good approximation .",
    "the interaction in the planes is antiferromagnetic and therefore frustrated .",
    "normal to the planes ( in the chain or @xmath8 direction ) , a ferromagnetic interaction competes with a dzyaloshinskii  moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite , giving an incommensurate ( ic ) structure with wavenumber @xmath9 in the @xmath8 direction . in more detail ,",

    "plane anisotropy in the interplane exchange@xcite ) and a coplanar structure is optimal at larger @xmath14 ( due to quantum fluctuations ) . other experiments@xcite support the nikuni  shiba analysis@xcite . in summary , cscucl@xmath0 in longitudinal field appears to be understood , except that the transition at high temperature @xmath15 has puzzling features@xcite .",
    "a transverse field ( in the planes , perpendicular to @xmath1 ) gives more surprises .",
    "the behaviour at low fields is conventional : @xmath16 decreases quadratically with @xmath14 , and the curvature increases@xcite with @xmath15 .",
    "classical ( mean  field ) theory@xcite gives both of these and also a transition to the commensurate ( c ) phase at @xmath17 ( at @xmath18 ) ; this transition has recently been observed@xcite , but at larger @xmath14 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "classical theory can not , however , explain any of the following : at low @xmath15 , unusual behaviour occurs for fields near @xmath20 , well below the ic@xmath21c transition ; structure is found in the magnetization@xcite , in the @xmath22cs nmr shift@xcite , in the ic wavenumber ( ref .",

    "linear spin  wave ( lsw ) theory , which adds the leading quantum correction to classical theory , gives a plateau in the magnetization of the c state@xcite ( as for the tafm ) , a promising start .",
    "but there is another surprise , this time in theory .",
    "not only does lsw theory of the ic phase fail to explain any of the other results , it actually provides a worse description of the ic phase than does classical theory , by predicting a premature ic@xmath21c transition@xcite at @xmath24 .",
    "an innovative phenomenological theory@xcite of quantum fluctuations explains the existence of the plateau@xcite in @xmath16 , and also its level .",
    "the theoretical value ( @xmath25 ) for the field at the ic@xmath21c transition@xcite is however too small , and the magnetization is not predicted well ; likely the phenomenological theory can be improved .",
    "both new findings@xcite near @xmath2 , namely the increase of @xmath2 with field ( as in the tafm@xcite ) and the second ic phase , are likely due to thermal fluctuations ; neither has yet been treated theoretically . because a microscopic or numerical treatment of fluctuations is out of the question for a vector  spin system with a nonsinusoidal ic structure , we use phenomenology . to treat a particular aspect of fluctuations near @xmath2 , namely effects related to the breaking of the classical degeneracy of the tafm ,",
    "we add to the standard landau theory a term biquadratic in the order parameter , as in our treatment@xcite of quantum fluctuations at @xmath18 ; this term appears neither in the hamiltonian nor in mean ",
    "field theory@xcite at any @xmath15 . of course",
    "this term is not intended to include fluctuation effects in general ( such phenomenology can not possibly explain the reduction of @xmath2 from the mean  field value of @xmath26k to the experimental value of @xmath27k ) .    in qualitative agreement with experiment@xcite ,",
    "the landau theory predicts a second ic phase to exist in a small @xmath15@xmath14 region near @xmath2 . as discussed in the preceding article@xcite and in section iv",
    ", the theory explains other properties of the new phase , qualitatively ; as discussed in the appendix , however , it does not explain the increase of @xmath2 with @xmath14 .",
    "the new phase is the high@xmath15 version of a state which arose in the classical theory@xcite ; the state exists at all @xmath15 in classical ( mean  field ) theory@xcite , but is never optimal .",
    "we argue that the new phase owes its existence to fluctuations ; these are strong enough to overcome an energy difference in classical theory , just as quantum fluctuations in longitudinal field overcome the small anisotropy@xcite .",
    "a unifying feature is that the two most striking of the experimental results in transverse field , namely the plateau@xcite in @xmath16 and the new phase@xcite near @xmath2 , are explained using the same phenomenological treatment of fluctuations , in ref . and here respectively .",
    "remarkably then , cscucl@xmath0 displays a fluctuation  induced phase transition in transverse field , and a different fluctuation  induced phase transition in longitudinal field@xcite .",
    "the main interactions are described by the hamiltonian @xmath28\\ , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the spin operator at the @xmath30th site in the @xmath31th @xmath32@xmath33 plane , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are unit vectors in the @xmath8 and @xmath32 directions , and the @xmath36 sum is over the six , in  plane , nearest neighbours of the site @xmath37 .",
    "the first term ( @xmath38 ) is the isotropic , ferromagnetic exchange interaction between spins in nearest  neighbour planes , the second ( @xmath39 ) is the interplane dm interaction , the third ( @xmath40 ) is the isotropic , frustrated , antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between nearest - neighbour spins in the @xmath32@xmath33 planes , and the fourth is the zeeman energy in a field @xmath41 transverse to the chains .",
    "we omit the easy  plane anisotropy@xcite in the interplane interaction , the dipole  dipole interaction , and several other effects .",
    "the coefficients have been estimated previously@xcite ; we use @xmath42k , @xmath43k and @xmath44k .",
    "the saturation field , above which each spin is aligned with the field at @xmath18 , is @xmath45 t .    at the classical level , the intrachain exchange term @xmath46 ) favours states with spins parallel in adjacent @xmath32@xmath33 planes while the smaller dm term ( @xmath47 ) favours states with spins in the planes and rotating by @xmath48 per plane . at zero field , for all @xmath49 ,",
    "the spins lie in the planes , forming the @xmath50 structure with three sublattices .",
    "the structure normal to the planes is helical ; the wavenumber at @xmath51 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "a transverse field deforms the helical structure , which becomes highly nonsinusoidal at higher @xmath14 .    for @xmath18 , the above hamiltonian was investigated in the classical approximation@xcite , and the leading quantum correction was obtained using linear spin  wave ( lsw ) theory@xcite .",
    "neither theory can account for the structure observed near @xmath23 , but a phenomenological treatment@xcite of quantum fluctuations is largely successful .",
    "the extension of classical theory to @xmath54 ( by mean  field theory ) gives a phase diagram@xcite with only one ic phase , and so an understanding of the new ic phase near @xmath2 seems to require including fluctuations at some level .",
    "a satisfactory microscopic treatment of fluctuations in cscucl@xmath0 is out of the question at @xmath18 , and they are even more difficult to treat for @xmath54 , leaving it seems only a phenomenological approach . for general @xmath54 , one could simply add the biquadratic term@xcite to the mean ",
    "field expression@xcite for the free energy , but the coefficient would have to be adjusted as fluctuation effects increase with @xmath15 , requiring a fit at each @xmath15 or strong guidance from theory ; this approach would be most reasonable near @xmath2 , if the mean  field free energy were expanded to fourth order in the order parameter .",
    "we have chosen instead to use a fourth  order landau theory .",
    "the following describes a minimal landau theory of cscucl@xmath0 near @xmath2 ; usually , landau theory is reliable regarding the phase diagram , less reliable regarding the order of the transitions , and unreliable regarding fine details like the position dependence of the order parameter .",
    "we assume a structure with three sublattices in the @xmath32@xmath33 planes and with period @xmath55 in the @xmath8 direction ( in units of the layer spacing ) ; the restriction to integer @xmath55 causes no difficulty@xcite .",
    "we assume also that the spins remain in the @xmath32@xmath33 planes at all @xmath14 and @xmath15 . curiously , the dm term is not sufficient for this@xcite ; the easy ",
    "plane anisotropy@xcite helps of course , but fluctuation effects seem to be necessary@xcite . in mean  field theory , the free energy would be expressed in terms of the site ",
    "dependent magnetization @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the sublattice index and @xmath58 is the layer index . in landau theory , the free energy is expanded in the order parameter @xmath59 , which is only proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "explicitly , we use the following expression for the free energy @xmath60 of the @xmath61 spins , relative to the paramagnetic state at @xmath51 : @xmath62 @xmath63 \\ . \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] this expression differs in major respects from the mean  field expansion to fourth order in @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) . on the one hand , we omit from the expansion many terms of the same order as the ones we keep , second  order terms as well as fourth  order terms ; on the other , and more importantly , we add a fourth  order term which does not appear in the expansion .",
    "all seven terms are essential .",
    "the third term in equation ( 2 ) is the zeeman energy ; the landau parameter @xmath66 is proportional to the magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "the terms with coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 are standard , while those with coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 result respectively from the in  plane antiferromagnetic interaction , the interplane ferromagnetic interaction and the dm interaction .",
    "the terms in @xmath67 and @xmath70 are adjusted so that the latter makes no contribution to the energy of the commensurate state .",
    "the remaining term , the biquadratic term @xmath72 , appears neither in the hamiltonian nor in the mean ",
    "field theory@xcite .",
    "it is introduced purely phenomenologically , to represent ( to the extent possible ) the effect of fluctuations ( here thermal ) ; the first such phenomenological use of the term was in ref .. in the tafm , fluctuations ( quantum or thermal ) act to favour the colinear phase at intermediate fields , and therefore we require @xmath73 ; since the strength of the fluctuations is however unknown , @xmath74 is otherwise adjustable ( except that @xmath75 for stability ) . in the tafm , and in the c state of cscucl@xmath0 ,",
    "the fluctuations break the classical degeneracy , selecting one state from the many .",
    "their effect in the ic phase of cscucl@xmath0 is far more subtle , for two reasons : first , the ic structure forbids the quantum selection possible in a c structure ; second , the classical ic phase is unconventional , being well described as a continuous sequence of degenerate commensurate states@xcite .",
    "the fluctuations act to reorient the spins , giving a conventional ic phase with domain walls separating nearly commensurate regions .",
    "this is why lsw theory of the ic phase fails : a treatment beyond lsw theory is necessary to account for the reorientation .",
    "the above landau theory is of course related to the mean  field theory of the ferromagnetically stacked tafm near @xmath2 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) of ref .",
    "( on the @xmath76 model ) , with @xmath77 for @xmath78 to 6 , reduces to our equation ( 2 ) with the last three terms ( coefficients @xmath74 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) omitted , although some effort is needed to see this . as discussed in ref . , the colinear phase stable at intermediate fields can not be obtained from this theory ; it is obtained however if only @xmath79 is different from ( less than ) the other @xmath80 , or if @xmath81 ( or @xmath82 ) is different .",
    "ref . noted that some effects of fluctuations can be mimicked by allowing some landau coefficients to depart from their mean  field values ; these authors did not consider the biquadratic term explicitly , but their intention was like ours , to break the classical tafm degeneracy .    from the hamiltonian",
