    "a classical hankel operator is a map between hilbert spaces whose matrix representation is constant along antidiagonals .",
    "a survey of these operators and their applications appears in @xcite .",
    "hankel operators arise naturally in the study of holomorphic function spaces .",
    "given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , define the operators @xmath2 the projection @xmath3 is known as the cauchy - szeg projection , and @xmath4 is the space of holomorphic functions on the open unit disk with square - integrable boundary values .",
    "the operator @xmath5 is a hankel operator , whose matrix representation we will write @xmath6 the function @xmath7 is called the symbol of @xmath8 , and the map @xmath9 is conformally equivariant in a sense explained in  2 .",
    "group - theoretic generalizations of this map , which are also conformally equivariant , were discovered in @xcite . here , we derive the following explicit expressions for these higher - order hankel operators .",
    "[ main ] the higher - order hankel operator of order @xmath10 with symbol @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , has the formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the differential operator @xmath15    in the case @xmath16 , this operator has the matrix representation @xmath17    the higher - order hankel forms introduced in @xcite are related to the transvectants @xmath18 of classical invariant theory @xcite , and to the rankin - cohen brackets appearing in the theory of modular forms @xcite .",
    "our map @xmath19 is the adjoint of the transvectant @xmath20 .",
    "these objects and their relationships have been studied from many perspectives @xcite . while the content of theorem [ main ] is basically known , our method of proof - viewing @xmath21 as an element of a universal enveloping algebra - appears to have some novelty .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we introduce spaces @xmath22 of sections of line bundles which are isomorphic to weighted bergman spaces , and a group action on them . in  3 , we outline the proof of theorem [ main ] , which involves first showing that @xmath19 is a linear differential operator of order @xmath23 , and then determining its coefficients . in  4 , we find embeddings of the spaces @xmath24 into the universal enveloping algebra of the lie algebra of vector fields on the unit disk .",
    "these embeddings determine the form of @xmath19 . in  5 , we find the image under @xmath19 of a key element of @xmath24 . in  6 , we prove theorem [ main ] , using several identities for binomial coefficients . in  7",
    ", we present a pair of binomial coefficient identities resulting from theorem [ main ] , and in  8 we relate the maps @xmath19 to transvectants and higher - order hankel forms .",
    "the group @xmath25 acts on the riemann sphere @xmath26 by linear fractional transformations , @xmath27 let @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the open unit disks around @xmath30 and infinity .",
    "the decomposition @xmath31 is stable under the action of @xmath32 . restricting its action to @xmath28 identifies @xmath32 with the group of conformal automorphisms of @xmath28 .    for each half - integer @xmath33 , the action of @xmath32 on @xmath34 lifts to an action of @xmath35 on @xmath36 , the @xmath37 ( tensor ) power of the canonical bundle .",
    "this induces an action of @xmath35 on the space of holomorphic sections of @xmath38 , the holomorphic differentials of degree @xmath33 on @xmath28 .",
    "we denote such a differential by @xmath39 , and the space of all such differentials by @xmath40 .",
    "the action of @xmath41 on @xmath40 is @xmath42    the action of @xmath35 on @xmath40 is essentially unitary for @xmath43 ; the dense hilbert subspace of @xmath40 with hermitian inner product @xmath44 will be denoted @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath45 if and only if @xmath46 belongs to the weighted bergman space @xmath47",
    ".    the space of sections of @xmath48 will be denoted @xmath49 .",
    "the action of @xmath35 and the @xmath35-invariant hermitian inner product on this space are also given by ( [ action ] ) and ( [ innerproduct ] ) , with @xmath50 .",
    "we will denote the hilbert subspace by @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 if and only if @xmath53 .    the decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) corresponds to an @xmath35-stable decomposition @xmath54 we abuse notation slightly by using @xmath3 to denote the projection onto @xmath55 , and @xmath56 to denote the projection onto @xmath57 . as noted , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the cauchy - szeg projection ( cauchy transform ) of @xmath46 .    if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , then @xmath62 is a one density on @xmath63 that can be integrated to a nontrivial constant , so @xmath64 .",
    "the decomposition ( [ hardy ] ) induces a diagonal action of @xmath35 on hilbert - schmidt operators sending @xmath57 to @xmath55 , via the identifications @xmath65 calculating the character of the rotation group @xmath66 , one sees that @xmath67 so for each @xmath68 there is an intertwining map @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 . then @xmath7 acts on @xmath71 by multiplication .",
    "with respect to the decomposition ( [ hardy ] ) , the multiplication operator @xmath72 can be written @xmath73 @xmath74 is the hankel operator associated to @xmath7 .",
    "the action of @xmath32 on @xmath75 intertwines with the diagonal action of @xmath35 on @xmath76 , and @xmath8 is hilbert - schmidt precisely when @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78 is an @xmath35-equivariant map from @xmath79 to @xmath76 .",
    "this motivates the following .",
    "the hankel operator of order @xmath33 with symbol @xmath80 is the image of @xmath81 under the intertwining map @xmath82 the space of hankel operators of order @xmath33 is the image of @xmath22 under this map .",
    "our geometric interpretation of higher - order hankel operators relies on two facts .",
    "first , for @xmath43 , the action of @xmath35 on @xmath40 is essentially irreducible .",
    "but if @xmath83 for @xmath84 , there is a short exact sequence @xmath85 @xmath86 can be given a hilbert space structure via the intertwining map @xmath87 , and we refer to this hilbert space as @xmath24 .",
    "we study the maps @xmath88 .",
    "second , in the case @xmath16 , @xmath89 is the lie algebra of complex vector fields on the unit disk ( note @xmath90 ) .",
    "these vector fields act on @xmath71 as differential operators of order @xmath91 via the lie derivative .",
    "composing this action with @xmath92 gives us a hankel operator of order two .",
    "for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , a formal calculation leads to @xmath95    the key to the higher - order hankel operators is that the above action of @xmath89 determines an action of @xmath96 on @xmath71 , as differential operators of order @xmath23 .",
    "each representation of @xmath89 corresponds to a representation of the universal enveloping algebra @xmath97 .",
    "the elements of @xmath97 act as linear differential operators on @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath98 be the space of symmetric tensors of order @xmath23 over @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath99 is isomorphic as a filtered vector space to @xmath97 , so elements of @xmath98 can be mapped to linear differential operators of order @xmath23 on @xmath71 . in  3 , we show the existence of a @xmath32-equivariant embedding of @xmath96 into @xmath98 .",
    "thus the image of @xmath96 under @xmath19 contains linear differential operators of order @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath19 is unique up to multiplication by a constant , and must map the lowest - weight vector in @xmath86 , namely @xmath100 , to the lowest - weight vector @xmath101 of weight @xmath102 in @xmath103 .",
    "we find the form of @xmath101 in  4 , and use it to find @xmath19 in  5 .",
    "finally , a technical point . the elements of @xmath89 may not extend to holomorphic vector fields on @xmath63 , so neither @xmath89 nor @xmath97 act naturally on @xmath71 a priori .",
    "however , the polynomial sections of @xmath104 , denoted by @xmath105 , do extend to @xmath63 , and the space of polynomial sections in @xmath96 , @xmath106 , is mapped into @xmath107 by the embedding from  3 . since @xmath106 is dense in @xmath24 , the action of @xmath106 on @xmath71 extends to an action of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath109 sits inside @xmath110 , the space of tensors of order @xmath111 .",
    "we will write a monomial in @xmath109 as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the symmetric group on @xmath111 elements . for each @xmath111 , @xmath98 projects onto @xmath96 via the map",
    "@xmath114 let @xmath115 .",
    "we refer to @xmath116 as the _ power _ of @xmath117 .",
    "the vectors @xmath118 are a basis for @xmath109 .",
    "we refer to @xmath119 as the _ total power _ of such a basis vector .",
    "the infinitesimal action of @xmath120 on @xmath40 , in terms of the coordinate @xmath121 , is @xmath122 the action of @xmath120 on @xmath110 is by a liebniz rule , and preserves the subspace of symmetric tensors .",
    "we denote this action by @xmath123 .",
    "the following lemma is key .",
    "@xmath124 , for some constant @xmath125 .    the raising operator @xmath126 maps a monomial of total power @xmath116 into a linear combination of monomials having total power @xmath127 .",
    "thus , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the set of partitions of @xmath130 into @xmath111 or fewer parts , arranged so that @xmath131 . at the same time , @xmath132 , so none of the parts @xmath133 can be greater than @xmath134 .",
    "but there is only one partition of @xmath130 into @xmath111 or fewer parts less than or equal to @xmath134 , namely @xmath135 for all @xmath136 .",
    "[ equisection ] for each @xmath111 , there is a @xmath137-equivariant cross - section of @xmath108 .    our strategy is to map the basis elements of @xmath96 , namely the set @xmath138 into @xmath98 , in such a way that the resulting cross - section is equivariant .",
    "it is clear from the action of @xmath139 on @xmath109 that @xmath140 must be mapped to an element having total power @xmath116 .",
    "thus , we map @xmath141 to the only monomial of total power zero , the vector @xmath142 .",
    "we map @xmath143 into a vector @xmath144 of total power @xmath145 .",
    "the images of all other basis vectors are obtained by applying the raising operator .",
    "the resulting cross - section will be equivariant provided that @xmath146    in fact , we take @xmath147 for example , for @xmath148 , one has @xmath149 the monomials in @xmath144 all have total power @xmath145 .",
    "the largest power @xmath116 ranges from @xmath150 to @xmath145 . among basis elements with highest power @xmath116 ,",
    "the sum includes all those where the remaining powers are no greater than two .",
    "thus the inner sum is really over partitions of @xmath151 into @xmath152 or fewer parts , each part being @xmath91 or @xmath134 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath153 are indexed by the highest power and @xmath154 , the ( symmetric tensor ) exponent of @xmath155 .",
    "if @xmath116 is even , @xmath154 is odd , and vice - versa .",
    "modulo parity , @xmath154 ranges from @xmath30 to the minimum of @xmath156 and @xmath151 .",
    "thus the range of @xmath154 increases until @xmath157 , and then decreases to @xmath158 when @xmath159 . for",
    "all other @xmath160 , take @xmath161 .    because the monomials in @xmath144 are all products of @xmath117 , @xmath162 , @xmath155 , and @xmath163 , applying @xmath164 to each monomial results in at most three terms .",
    "in fact , @xmath165 where @xmath166 thus , choosing @xmath167 , and defining @xmath168\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all other @xmath116 and @xmath154 , one obtains ( [ cond ] ) . this recursion relation is linear , and terminates at @xmath159 .",
    "thus it can be solved , and @xmath144 exists and satisfies ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "this proves the proposition .",
    "the action of @xmath169 on @xmath170 is again by a liebniz rule , and will be denoted @xmath171 .",
    "the irreducible subspaces of @xmath103 are lowest - weight representations of @xmath35 .",
    "we now identify the vectors in @xmath103 annihilated by @xmath172 .",
    "[ lowestweight ] the set of vectors @xmath173 are annihilated by the operator @xmath172 .",
    "the vector @xmath101 has weight @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath174 .",
    "applying @xmath172 to @xmath175 results in two terms unless @xmath176 or @xmath177 , so we pull these cases out of the sum @xmath101 . thus @xmath178=&sb_{s-1}\\otimes b_0+\\sum_{i=1}^{s-1}(-1)^i{\\left(\\!\\!\\begin{tabular}{c } $ s$ \\\\ $ i$ \\end{tabular}\\!\\!\\right)}{\\pi_{\\otimes}\\left(a^-\\right)}\\left[b_{s - i}\\otimes b_i\\right]+(-1)^{s}sb_0\\otimes b_{s-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
