    "a longstanding goal of observational cosmology has been the detection of a diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) , suspected to contain a major fraction of the baryons of the universe produced in the big - bang , by means of the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) effect .",

    "the former is not saturated in heii , in contrast to hi and ovi , which means that heii is highly ionized close to the qso . the apparent heii edge at and the absorption between 1182 and 1186.5    is exclusively due to the partially resolved heii lines of the associated system .",
    "besides the highly redshifted associated systems with @xmath52 to 2.904 ( up to 1500 kms@xmath6 relative to the qso at @xmath1 ) there are two further systems with highly ionized species : @xmath53 ( nv and civ , unsaturated ly@xmath7 ) and 2.863 ( ovi , weak civ , no nv , saturated ly@xmath7 ) . the latter again appears to show an unsaturated heii303.8   line , like the redshifted associated system .    in summary , if the associated heii absorption is taken into account , the true observed heii edge is estimated to be around @xmath54 , cf .",

    "a local continuum definition is difficult due to the high absorption line density .",

    "the continuum for the ghrs data was then constructed by fitting a low - order polynomial to these mean flux values . as is obvious from the ghrs data longward of the heii edge there are still numerous absorption lines presumable from heavy elements , since the number of ly@xmath7 clouds expected in this range is small at these low redshifts ( bahcall et al .",
    "thus the derived continuum level might be underestimated due to unresolved line blending . this effect , however , should not influence the analysis of the heii absorption since it is expected to be of the same amount longward and shortward of the heii edge .",

    "( 1996 ) , qsos are an order of magnitude less abundant at @xmath145 than at @xmath146 , i.e. the turnon of the qsos as ionizing sources is even later than assumed by madau & meiksin ( 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence from modelling of the ly@xmath7 forest that for @xmath32 the uv - background due to qsos is not sufficient and that additional sources of photons are required for @xmath32 ( rauch et al .",
    "if these sources are stars , the resulting softer uv background possibly meets the condition for delayed heii ionization .",
    "in addition , it has been shown by giroux & shapiro ( 1996 ) that in case of an igm partially collisionally ionized due to bulk heating in addition to photoionization , he ionization will be lag behind hydrogen ionization .",
    "there is also evidence of an abrupt change in the civ / siiv column density ratio around @xmath144 ( songaila & cowie 1996 ) , which indicates a softening of the ionizing uv background with increasing @xmath59 : @xmath147 to 40 below @xmath148 and @xmath149 above @xmath148 .    in case of only singly ionized helium ,",
    "the amount of diffuse gas needed to produce the `` trough '' opacity @xmath150 is given by @xmath151 for q@xmath152 ( madau & meiksin 1994 ) which leads to @xmath153 1.3 @xmath154 10@xmath155 h@xmath18 .",
    "only 0.3 % of the big - bang nucleosynthesis baryon density @xmath126 = 0.05 h@xmath127 is required to produce the blacked - out troughs .",
    "this would be consistent with the theoretical predictions that fragmentation of the igm is nearly complete .",
    "it is easy to show that even for a soft ionizing spectrum ( @xmath7 = 2 ) the `` troughs '' will not be seen in hei584   since @xmath156 for @xmath157 = 0.02 ( cf .",
    "jakobsen 1995 ) . the fos spectrum around 2240",
    "  confirms the absence of a hei trough .",
    "an extremely luminous qso like he2347@xmath04342 is expected to show a proximity effect except for the rather improbable case that the qso has been turned on only recently .    the influence of the uv radiation of the qso itself on the second ionization of he has been studied theoretically by various authors ( e.g.  zheng & davidsen 1995 ; meiksin 1995 ; giroux et al .",
    "the prediction is that close to the qso heii is additionally ionized and that the effect is stronger in diffuse than in clumped gas .",
    "consequently , if the heii opacity close to the qso is dominated by a diffuse component , we expect increased transparency in a heiii bubble around the qso , close to the rest redshift of the qso , while the effect will be weaker in the ly@xmath7 forest .",
    "no proximity effect has been seen in hs1700 + 6416 ( davidsen et al .",
    "1996 ) , while hogan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed in q0302@xmath0003 a `` shelf '' in the heii opacity blueward of the main heii edge which they interpret as a proximity effect in diffuse heii gas .",
    "if , as concluded above , the `` troughs '' in the heii forest at 11621173   and 11761182    are caused by not fully ionized gas , we should expect that he2347@xmath04342 , which at the time of observation is one of the most luminous sources in the universe , produces a strong proximity effect .    in the following",
    "we estimate the heii ionizing flux of he2347@xmath04342 and discuss its effect on the surrounding medium .",
    "uv spectra of high - redshift quasars are strongly influenced by absorption of intervening absorbers . in order to find the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of the quasar corrections have to be applied to the observed data . in the following",
    "we will consider only the flux depression by cumulative hydrogen continuum absorption of intervening absorbers , neglecting effects of dust absorption along the line of sight or line blanketing in the uv .",
    "uncertainties in the absolute flux calibrations of the spectra up to 1020 % are possible .",
    "the dereddened spectra of he2347@xmath04342 were corrected for continuum absorption by neutral hydrogen in the strong lls at @xmath45 .",
    "the continuously rising spectrum of he2347@xmath04342 shows no evidence for further strong absorbers with log@xmath158 .",
    "the additional `` lyman valley '' depression of the quasar continuum due to the cumulative hydrogen absorption by the numerous ly@xmath7 clouds with @xmath159log@xmath160 was estimated by monte carlo simulations . since @xmath161   is not directly observable , we take the corrected continuum value at the smallest observed wavelength ( @xmath162  ) , assuming that it is close to the flux at 228  .",
    "we find @xmath163(885.78 )@xmath164(1157 )= 6.4  10@xmath42 erg s@xmath6 @xmath5 @xmath6 , i.e. nearly a factor of 2 higher than the observed flux .    for the qso flux at @xmath165   we considered the flux in the range from 3560 to 3580   in the optical data just longward of the corresponding but unobserved wavelength @xmath166  . since in low - resolution optical data the flux",
    "is depressed by unresolved line blanketing of ly@xmath7 forest lines , we rebinned our high - resolution optical data to estimate the flux depression by line blending .",
    "the resulting flux is then @xmath167 )=1.75 10@xmath42 erg s@xmath6 @xmath5 @xmath6 yielding a ratio of @xmath168 . adopting a pure power law ( @xmath169 ) for the intrinsic euv spectral energy distribution @xmath170 turns into @xmath171 , which is a typical value for several luminous qsos observed with hst ( khler & reimers 1996 ) . in the proximity of the quasar we thereby do not expect a strong contribution from diffuse helium . with @xmath172 ( madau & meiksin 1994 ) and @xmath173 ( giallongo et al .",
    "1994 ) we expect for @xmath170 an optical depth of the diffuse component @xmath174 comparable to @xmath175 derived from the observations . for the associated system we would expect @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) also consistent with the observation at least for the components at highest redshifts when adopting turbulent line broadening .    for a qso flux at the heii edge of @xmath178 erg s@xmath6 @xmath5",

    "this means that he2347@xmath04342 with its observed hard ( @xmath185 ) euv spectrum dominates heii ionization at least up to the @xmath186   void .",
    "this is not observed .",
    "why does he2347@xmath04342",
    "ionize heii in the associated system but not in the troughs , in particular the region @xmath1871180  ?",
    "there is only one plausible reason for the nonexistence of a proximity effect in heii : shielding by clouds optically thick in the heii228   continuum along the line of sight .",
    "possible candidates are the associated system clouds .",
    "a reliable estimate of the neutral hydrogen column densities of the individual components of the associated system is difficult due to the complex structure of the system and saturation effects .",
    "higher lyman series lines up to hi920 are visible , but the signal to noise ratio of our spectrum decreases rapidly at shorter wavelengths .",
    "according to absorption line fits the largest column density for a single component should not exceed log@xmath188 for @xmath189 km s@xmath6 . from optical data",
    "we can not preclude the existence of a small break at the lyman edge expected at @xmath190 3550  .",
    "the maximum total hi column density compatible with the optical data is then @xmath191 @xmath5 . with the hi column densities derived from modelling of lyman series lines adopting @xmath192 km s@xmath6 for the 14 individual components the observed heii absorption requires @xmath193 for thermal line broadening .",
    "thus for a single component with log@xmath194 and @xmath193 we find @xmath195 @xmath5 .",
    "the clouds become optically thick for heii at a column density 6.3 10@xmath196 @xmath5 and self shielding could enhance the heii absorption .",
    "in fact , as was mentioned in sect .  3 , @xmath88 gives a better fit for the lower redshift components ( @xmath832.8985 ) which leads to possibly @xmath197 @xmath5 , sufficient to shield the igm in our direction from heii ionizing photons .",
    "a detailed analysis of the associated system with better optical data will help to improve the constraints for the heii continuum absorption .",
    "what is the origin of the 1160   and 1174   voids ? if the troughs are due to unionized heii which completely shields the euv background at @xmath198  , we have to assume that individual sources ( qso and/or starburst galaxies ) create heiii regions within the unionized igm . with a diameter of 2.8 h@xmath20 mpc for the 1160   void ,",
    "the requirements on the luminosities of possible sources are moderate ( cf .",
    "bajtlik et al .  1988 ,",
    "giroux & shapiro 1996 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath199 would favour at least a contribution by stars in the ionizing source .",
    "we have shown that the igm in the line of sight of he2347@xmath04342 is `` patchy '' in the sense that there are and `` troughs '' . in the voids ,",
    "the heii opacity can be understood as ly@xmath7 forest line opacity with either @xmath10 = 100 and @xmath73 and no diffuse medium or ly@xmath7 forest line opacity with @xmath10 = 45 and @xmath200 plus a diffuse medium with @xmath98 = 0.3 .",
    "the heii opacity seen in the voids is consistent with what has been found in hs1700 + 6416 ( davidsen et al .",
    "1996 ) or in the q0302@xmath0003 void by hogan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in the `` troughs ''",
    "we need in addition to the heii ly@xmath7 forest opacity a continuous opacity of @xmath201 @xmath202 4.8 ( @xmath203 is a strict lower limit ) .",
    "a natural explanation for this dichotomy is the assumption of delayed heii ionization , as predicted by e.g.  madau & meiksin ( 1994 ) , where in the phase of reionization of the universe there are still not yet ionized heii regions between the expanding heiii regions . in that case",
    "@xmath204 h@xmath18 would be necessary .",
    "the absorption troughs have the shape and widths as predicted by meiksin & madau ( 1993 ) .",
    "the patchy heii opacity appears to be the `` missing link '' between the @xmath205 at @xmath206 in hs1700 + 6416 and the high opacity in q0302@xmath0003 at @xmath207 : the `` voids '' + in he2347@xmath04342 have optical depths comparable to the mean opacity observed in hs1700 + 6416 and represent the reionized igm , while the `` troughs '' represent the igm with delayed heii reionization which may also be the case for q0302@xmath0003 and pks1935@xmath0692 at @xmath208 .",
    "it is important to repeat the heii opacity measurement in case of q0302@xmath0003 with stis because the background subtraction procedure applied to the ghrs data appears doubtful at such low flux levels .",
    "our heii observations are in accordance with songaila and cowie s ( 1996 ) finding from the observed civ / siiv ratio as a function of redshift that around @xmath209 there appears to be a transition from a soft ionizing uv background ( @xmath93 ) to relatively hard ionizing radiation ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "if confirmed by further observations , the delayed heii ionization gives important constraints on the evolution of the uv background for @xmath93 .",
    "the same ionization model of madau & meiksin ( 1994 ) which predicts incomplete heii ionization for @xmath211 predicts incomplete hi ionization for @xmath212 .",
    "after our observation of delayed heii ionization there appears to be a realistic chance to observe directly the phase of reionization of the universe if @xmath213 qsos exist since the latter might show hi blacked - out troughs similar to what we have seen in heii .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that he2347@xmath04342 is just one line of sight , and that before generalizations are possible , more objects have to be probed .    the absence of a measurable proximity effect in he2347@xmath04342 might be explained by shielding of @xmath214    radiation by the clouds responsible for the strong associated system seen toward this quasar .",
    "observations of the heii troughs in he2347@xmath04342 with stis in low resolution can be expected to yield an improved lower limit to the diffuse density in the yet unionized medium , and he2347@xmath04342 is even bright enough in the 1160   void for fuse to resolve directly the heii304    forest .",
