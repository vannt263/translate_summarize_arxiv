    "approaches to modeling the dark energy are based either on a particular choice of its equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath4 or on modifications of gravity at very large scales . in the context of general relativistic models ,",
    "at least three different ways may be followed in order to find the dark energy eos from observations .",
    "the first and most direct one is to solve the scalar field equations for a particular theory , which clearly can not provide a model - independent parameter space to be compared with the observational data .",
    "other possibilities are either to build a functional form for @xmath4 in terms of its current value @xmath5 and of its time - dependence @xmath6 or to perform a parameter - free approach , such as binned eos , decomposition into orthogonal basis and principal component analysis .    however",
    ", irrespective of the choice made , it seems clear nowadays that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to single out the best - fit dark energy model on observational data basis only . as well observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , one may , instead of trying to find which dark energy scenario is correct , test which models can be ruled out by the available observations .",
    "this , of course , will not unveil the nature of the dark energy but may , with the current and upcoming observational data , diminish considerably the range of possibilities .    an interesting example in this direction involves two of the favorite candidates for dark energy , namely , the vacuum energy density ( @xmath2 ) and a dynamical scalar field ( @xmath7 ) . among other things ,",
    "what observationally may differ these two candidates for dark energy is that , in the former case , the eos associated with @xmath2 is constant along the evolution of the universe ( @xmath8 ) whereas in generic quintessence scenarios @xmath4 is a function of time  @xcite .",
    "therefore , taking this important difference into account , one may conclude that if any observable deviation from a constant eos is consistently found , this naturally poses a problem for any model based on this assumption , which includes our standard cosmological scenario .    0.1 in    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a method to investigate a possible time - dependence of the dark energy equation of state from current observational data . differently from other approaches that use parameterizations of @xmath4  @xcite or @xmath9  @xcite",
    ", we use only the taylor expansion of the dark energy density @xmath9 around different values of @xmath10 and the conservation equation as a recurrence formula , so that the @xmath9 derivatives can be directly related to @xmath4 and its derivatives . in doing this ,",
    "we reduce considerably the smearing effect ( due to the multiple integrals that relate @xmath4 to cosmological distances ) that makes constraining @xmath4 extremely difficult ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , unlike the first order parameterizations of @xmath4 , in which the time - dependence is determined uniquely by the value of @xmath6 at a specific @xmath10 ( usually @xmath11 ) , in this approach such variation may be verified at different values of @xmath10 by changing the expansion center @xmath12 at small redshift intervals . from this , we build @xmath4 and @xmath13 from the data and discuss the behavior of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 spaces .",
    "we use in our analyses two of the most recent sne ia data sets , namely , the updated compilation of union sample ( u2 )  @xcite and the nearby + sdss + essence + snls + hubble space telescope ( hst ) set of 288 sne ia discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( throughout this paper we refer to this set as sdss compilation ) .",
    "we consider two sub - samples of this latter compilation that use salt2  @xcite and mlcs2k2  @xcite sn ia light - curve fitting methods . along with the sne",
    "ia data , and to diminish the degeneracy between the two free parameters of the model we also use the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak at @xmath16 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a friedmann - robertson - walker universe dominated by non - relativistic matter ( baryonic and dark ) and some form of dark energy .",
    "the friedmann equation for this scenario is given by @xmath17 -\\frac{k}{a^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the hubble and curvature parameters , @xmath20 is the cosmological scale factor , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the non - relativistic matter and dark energy density parameters .",
    "now , let us suppose that @xmath9 is an analytic function in the range @xmath23 , so that its taylor series , @xmath24 converges to @xmath9 in this range",
    ". since the components of the cosmic fluid are separately conserved , the dark energy density @xmath9 and its eos parameter @xmath4 are directly related by the conservation equation @xmath25 note that we can use the above equation as a recurrence formula to write the derivatives of @xmath22 at @xmath26 in terms of the eos parameters derivatives , i.e. , @xmath27\\rho_{\\rm{de}}(z^*)\\;,\\\\ \\",
    "\\vdots&&\\   \\vdots \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath28/(1+z^*)$ ] and a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath10 . from the above results",
    ", we can rewrite the friedmann equation ( [ eq.fried ] ) as @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31(z - z^*)^2+\\cdots\\ ; , \\ ] ] and the subscript  0 \" denotes present - day quantities . in",
    "what follows , we will restrict our analysis up to the second order expansion of @xmath9 .",
    "the practical reason for this choice is that it involves the minimal number of parameters [ @xmath4 and @xmath13 ] required to probe the eos time - dependence .",
    "however , in doing so it is important to observe that we are also assuming that the real function describing the dark energy density is a well - behaved function of @xmath10 with a smooth behavior in the @xmath33 interval , so that the higher order terms are negligible compared to those considered .",
    "this assumption in turn is well justified since the result @xmath34 seems to be in good agreement with most of the current data  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in order to discuss the current observational constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath13 we use two of the most recent sne ia compilations available , namely , the union2 sample of ref .",
    "@xcite and the two compilations of the sdss collaborations discussed in ref .",
    "the union2 sample is an update of the original union compilation .",
    "it comprises 557 data points including recent large samples from other surveys and uses salt2 for sn ia light - curve fitting .",
    "the sdss compilation of 288 sne ia uses both salt2 and mlcs2k2 light - curve fitters and is distributed in redshift interval @xmath35 .    along with the sne ia data , and to diminish the degeneracy between the dark energy parameters @xmath36 , @xmath4 and @xmath13 , we also use the bao parameter  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38^{1/3}$ ] is the so - called dilation scale , defined in terms of the comoving distance @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath41 is taken as a nuisance parameter and we marginalize over it . in our statistical analysis , therefore , we minimize the function @xmath42 , which takes into account all the data sets mentioned above . motivated by the recent results of the cmb power spectrum  @xcite , we assume spatial flatness in the following analyses .",
    "0.1 in    figure 1 shows contours of @xmath43 arising from the joint analysis u2 + bao ( panel 1a ) , sdss ( salt2 ) + bao ( panel 1b ) and sdss ( mlcs2k2)+bao ( panel 1c ) for the second order expansion around @xmath44 ( solid contour ) . for the sake of comparison we also display the corresponding @xmath45 contours for two different first order parameterizations , i.e. , @xmath46 the so - called cpl parameterization  @xcite ( dotted contour ) and @xmath47 proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dashed contour ) as well as back to the last scattering surface of the cmb at @xmath48 ( see also  @xcite for other first order parameterizations ) . ] .",
    "we note that , although there is space for both negative and positive values of @xmath49 ( or , equivalently , @xmath50 ) , as well as for phantom - like  @xcite and quintessence - like  @xcite dark energy , the allowed parameter space for our second order expansion can be considerably reduced relative to the one produced by the first order eos parameterizations and @xmath51 from u2 sample ( see table i ) , we found that the relative error @xmath52 at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the difference between the energy density derived from the above parameterizations and their second order expansions . ] .",
    "we believe that this constraining power shown in these analyses may be a consequence of the reduction of the smearing effect mentioned earlier  @xcite , since in our approach the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 appear in the expansion rate ( eq .",
    "( [ friedmanneq2 ] ) ) not as an exponent of the @xmath22 function ( as in the case of first order parameterizations ) .    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     however , as mentioned earlier , the most interesting aspect in the above approach is that a possible time evolution of @xmath4 and of its derivatives can be verified from the data at different values of @xmath12 by changing the expansion center at small redshift intervals .",
    "this procedure differs fundamentally from usual first order parameterizations in that variations of the eos parameter at @xmath57 can not be detected if @xmath4 is a smooth function around @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , this amounts to saying that in the approach discussed in this paper , finding the pair @xmath59 inside a significant confidence region can not be taken as a definitive argument for a non - evolving dark energy since a single value of @xmath60 at any @xmath61 is enough to ensure its time - dependence .",
    "this possibility is tested in figures 2a-2i , where we show contours of @xmath43 in the @xmath0 - @xmath6 plane for the three combinations of data discussed above .",
    "the contours are obtained as follows :    1 .",
    "fix the expansion center @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ friedmanneq2 ] ) ; 2 .",
    "perform the statistical analysis described above to obtain the values of @xmath36 , @xmath0 and @xmath62 and their corresponding error bars at @xmath12 ; 3 .",
    "set @xmath63 and repeat the previous step to estimate the above parameters at @xmath64 .    in our analysis",
    ", we divided the entire interval in @xmath65 from @xmath11 up to the highest redshift of our sample , i.e. , @xmath66 . in panels 2a-2i",
    ", solid , dashed and dotted curves stand for the @xmath45 contours from u2 + bao , sdss ( salt2 ) + bao and sdss ( mlcs2k2 ) + bao , respectively .",
    "for all combinations of sne ia + bao , it is clear that the second order expansion is fully compatible with a non - evolving eos ( @xmath67 ) for the entire redshift interval considered .",
    "the same , however , can not be said when we consider specifically the standard @xmath2cdm case and the combination sdss ( mlcs2k2 ) + bao ( dotted line ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath68 or , equivalently , @xmath8 and @xmath67 ( see eq .  [ eq.dedensity ] ) , which is off from the best - fit value by @xmath69 ( c.l . ) for several values of @xmath12 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we also show the resulting contours for two analyses with @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 ( panel 2a ) and @xmath72 ( panel 2b ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath6 as functions of the redshift for the combination of data discussed above .",
    "the error bars correspond to the confidence intervals obtained for @xmath73 .",
    "following the curve indicated by the best - fit points , the @xmath14 plane for all combinations seems to indicate a freezing behavior , which in agreement with recent discussions using reconstructing techniques such as the principal component analysis  @xcite and the maximum entropy method  @xcite . from these panels",
    ", we can see more clearly that , although compatible with a time - independent eos parameter ( @xmath67 ) , some combinations of the current data ( sdss ( mlcs2k2 ) + bao ) can show a departure from the @xmath2cdm case ( @xmath8 and @xmath67 ) for some values of @xmath12 .",
    "more quantitatively , this can be seen in table i , where we display the numerical values obtained in our analyses . for completeness",
    ", we also tested the influence of a nonvanishing curvature parameter on these results ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a discussion ) . by considering the current interval from wmap + @xmath41 + bao data",
    ", i.e. , @xmath74  @xcite , we verified that all the above conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "we have proposed a new method to constrain a possible time - dependence of the dark energy from current observational data . by expanding the function @xmath9 around different values of @xmath10 and using the conservation equation as a recurrence formula",
    ", we have shown a clear compatibility of current sne and bao data with a non - evolving eos for all samples considered .",
    "our method is based on the assumption that the dark energy density has a smooth behavior up to @xmath75 , so that higher order terms in the @xmath22 expansion are negligible when compared with the first and second ones . besides involving the minimal number of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath13 required to probe the eos time - dependence ( see eq .",
    "[ friedmanneq2 ] ) , this seems to be a plausible assumption since a dark energy behavior somewhat close to a cosmological constant ( @xmath76 ) is fully supported by many analyses ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . we have also discussed some advantages of this approach over first order parameterizations commonly used in the literature and shown that the so - called smearing effect in the determinations of the @xmath4 evolution may be greatly reduced .",
    "we believe that the next generation of experiments dedicated to measure the dark energy properties ( mainly those measuring the expansion history from high-@xmath10 sne ia , baryon oscillations , etc . ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite ) will probe cosmology with sufficient accuracy to decide between an evolving and a non - evolving dark energy eos . in this regard",
