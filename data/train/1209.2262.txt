    "photon detection has become an essential measurement technique in science and engineering .",
    "indeed , applications such as positron emission tomography ( pet ) , single - photon emission computed tomography , flow cytometry , lidar , fluorescence detection , confocal microscopy , and radiation detection all rely on accurate measurement of photon fluxes . traditionally , the preferred measurement device has been the photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , which is a high - gain , low - noise photon detector with a high - frequency response and a large area of collection . in particular",
    ", it behaves as an ideal current generator for steady photon fluxes , making it suitable for use in applications in astronomy and medical imaging , among others .",
    "however , they are bulky , require manual assembly steps , and have limited spatial resolution for pet . for these reasons , extensive research has focused on finding feasible solid - state alternatives that can operate at much lower voltages , are immune to magnetic effects , have increased efficiency , and are smaller in physical size  @xcite .",
    "recent designs have raised significant interest in the community , and their use as a replacement for pmts in applications such as pet imaging  @xcite , high - energy physics  @xcite , astrophysics  @xcite , lidar  @xcite , and flow cytometry has been recently explored .",
    "silicon photomultiplier ( sipm ) devices consist of two - dimensional arrays of geiger avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) that are run above their breakdown voltage and are integrated with either an active or passive quenching circuit .",
    "devices built up from these geiger apd microcells are characterized by the fraction of sensing area on the device ( the fill factor ) , and the fraction of incident photons that cause charged apds to fire ( the detection quantum efficiency ) .",
    "the product of these two quantities gives the combined photon detection efficiency ( pde ) .",
    "the compatibility of geiger apds with standard cmos technology has enabled a number of different designs .",
    "for example , the digital silicon photomultiplier ( dsipm ) @xcite adds processing circuitry to count the total number of photons hitting the sensor and records the time stamp of the first group of photons that crosses a predetermined photon intensity threshold .",
    "the resolution of the resulting sensor coincides with the size of the entire sensor ( usually 3 mm @xmath0 3 mm in area ) whereas the temporal sampling is limited to a single time stamp per pulse .",
    "nevertheless , the sensor does achieve a very high fill factor ( 80% ) and is , therefore , very sensitive .",
    "note that in sipm terminology , the above tiling of microcells into larger atomic units is often referred to as a pixel . throughout this paper , however , we use the term pixel to refer to individual geiger apd microcells , since they represent the smallest resolvable element in our proposed design .    an alternative sensor design , called spad , aims at a high temporal resolution and registers the time of each pixel ( apd ) firing @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by connecting each pixel to a high - performance time - to - digital converter ( tdc ) , which records a time stamp in a memory buffer whenever a signal is detected on its input .",
    "because of their relatively low complexity , especially when compared to analog - to - digital converters , tdcs allow the sensor to achieve an extremely high temporal resolution . however , the spatial resolution of the sensor is severely compromised by the large amount of support circuitry between neighboring pixels , resulting in an extremely low fill factor of approximately 15% .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +   + ( * b * ) @xmath5 pixel grid    as seen , even when the number of simultaneous pixel firings exceeds the disjunctness of the group - testing design , it often remains possible to uniquely decode the resulting codeword . to get more accurate statistics",
    ", we studied the decoding properties of randomly generated sparse vectors ( corresponding to random pixel firing patterns ) with the number of nonzero entries ranging from 1 to 20 . for each sparsity level",
    "we decoded 10,000 vectors and summarize the success rates in figure  [ fig : decodesparsity ] .",
    "the plots show that recovery breaks down only gradually once the sparsity exceeds the disjunctness level of the matrix .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath6 ( dashed ) . for each sparsity level 10,000",
    "random vectors were generated and decoded . ]",
    "for the adaptation of the group - testing based design in practical designs , a number of additional issues needs to be addressed .",
    "we discuss some of the major ones below .",
    "[ [ decoding . ] ] decoding .",
    "+ + + + + + + + +    since the tdcs store time stamps in a memory buffer , we can perform the decoding process off - line .",
    "this is analogous to the operation of a digital storage oscilloscope . aside from the obvious benefit of reducing the amount of circuitry",
    ", it has the advantage that we have a global view of the entire data , not just the current event , or a short history of previous events .",
    "this data can be used to extract more information from unsuccessfully decoded events by excluding columns corresponding to pixels that fired shortly before or after the current event , or by using more sophisticated , but perhaps combinatorial decoding techniques .",
    "[ [ asynchronicity - of - the - system . ] ] asynchronicity of the system .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one challenge in the implementation of the proposed design is to make sure that the tdcs connected to a single pixel all record the firing of that pixel in the same tdc interval . in other words , it is important that codewords are recorded in a single interval and not spread out over two consecutive intervals . such a shift can occur due to differences of travel times of signals between the pixel and the tdcs as a result of differences in wiring lengths .",
    "the appearance of partial codewords in test vectors complicates decoding and may cause pixel firings to be masked by others and be missed completely with no means of detection .",
    "there are two main approaches of dealing with this problem .",
    "the first approach is to synchronize the logical signal generated by the pixel using a global clock across the chip to ensure uniform arrival of signals to the tdc digitizers .",
    "such an approach has been successfully implemented in clock design trees of cpu chips that maintain clock skews less than the tdc sampling frequency @xcite .",
    "the second approach is to consider bursts of consecutive events and decode the union of the corresponding test vectors as a whole .",
    "this also leads to an increase in the expected number of simultaneous firings as well as a slight decrease in temporal resolution .",
    "this approach is possible only when the photon flux is sufficiently low ; when many consecutive tdc windows contain events , their union simply contains too many pixel firings to be successfully decoded .",
