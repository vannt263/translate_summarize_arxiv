    "spatially and/or temporally varying patterns have been observed in a variety of physical  @xcite , chemical  @xcite and biological  @xcite systems operating far from equilibrium .",
    "the interest in understanding the physics of pattern formation in these systems has been increasing steadily over the last few years especially after the experimental verification of turing s idea  @xcite . in chemical and biological systems for instance , macroscopic reaction - diffusion equations",
    "have been proposed as models for morphogenesis  @xcite , pattern formation  @xcite and self - organization  @xcite .",
    "this class of equations usually includes the following two features : ( i ) a nonlinear reaction between chemical species describing local production or consumption of the species and ( ii ) the diffusive transport of these species due to density gradients .",
    "the simple form of the reaction - diffusion equation for a system of @xmath0 species is described by the following set of equations @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the mass density or concentration of species @xmath3 at time @xmath4 and location @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the laplacian operator with respect to spatial coordinate @xmath5 , and @xmath7 is the diffusion coefficient of individual species @xmath3 . in this work , we assume that @xmath7 is isotropic and independent of @xmath5 . the last term on the right hand side , @xmath8 ,",
    "is the reaction term .",
    "this term depends on the local density or concentration of the individual reacting species and the reaction mechanism governing the system . in most pattern",
    "forming systems , @xmath8 usually contains non - linear or autocatalytic reaction terms with product of the densities of the reacting species .    due to their great importance both in biology , environmental science and industry ,",
    "there has been growing interest in a study of these systems both experimentally , by numerical integration of the governing equations via well - tuned analytic theories ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , solving problems with complex geometry ( as is sometimes the case in biological systems ) often requires a more efficient and robust method .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method has met significant success in simulating a wide range of phenomena in complex geometries over the last decades  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with other traditional numerical techniques which only focus on the solution of the governing macroscopic equation , the lattice boltzmann method is based on kinetic theory . in cell - scale modeling of micro - organisms",
    "@xcite for instance , the kinetic nature of the lattice boltzmann method makes the approach computationally less demanding and allows for a relatively simple implementation of microbial interactions between cells .",
    "furthermore , for problems involving large domain sizes , the local nature of lb operations allows easier implementation on parallel computational platforms thus enabling fast and large scale computations .",
    "in addition to the above features , the inherent capability of the lb approach in dealing with irregular boundaries , makes it suitable for studying reaction - diffusion phenomena in porous media  @xcite at the pore scale . however the accuracy and efficiency of a numerical method are often evaluated in terms of the smallest truncation error within the method . in previous lattice boltzmann studies of reaction - diffusion equation  @xcite , it is rather unclear as to how the truncation error varies with the system parameters such as reaction rate and diffusion constant .",
    "these parameters become important in pattern forming systems where non - linear reaction terms are present and reaction rate as well as diffusion constant may vary over a wide range . thus , for a better performance and accuracy , it is important to find out whether there is a range of optimal parameters that leads to the smallest truncation error and a better convergence of the method . such a study is performed in this work for the case of a single species reaction - diffusion systems . performing a third - order chapman - enskog multiscale expansion",
    ", we investigate the dependence of the truncation error on the system parameters .",
    "indeed , for this simple case , while the truncation error linearly varies with the reaction rate , it exhibits a pronounced minimum as a function of the diffusion coefficient .    in order to extend the investigation to a pattern forming multi - species reaction - diffusion model",
    ", we have selected the gray - scott model  @xcite , which serves as a standard paradigm for studying reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "the gray - scott model , though simple , exhibits a wide range of interesting dynamical features including spots  @xcite , spiral waves  @xcite , stationary waves  @xcite and spatio - temporal chaos  @xcite .",
    "a particular feature of this model which makes it different from the other models is the existence of the so called self replicating spots  @xcite .",
    "spatially localized cell like structures grow , deform and make replica of themselves .",
    "this act of `` cell division '' resembling dna and rna replication in cells or the replication growth of biological cells as seen in developmental biology makes it an ideal model for studying these biological systems with regard to pattern formation . in this reaction - diffusion system ,",
    "generation of patterns comes usually from the instability of an initially uniform state to spatially inhomogeneous perturbations over a certain range of wavelengths .",
    "the possible range of wavelengths , as determined by a fixed set of system parameters , is usually invariant against a change of the system size .",
    "a change in system size often leads to a corresponding change in the number of spots , stripes or segments observed in the system .",
    "hence , the number of segments or stripes is not invariant but proportional to the system size .",
    "in contrast , for some biological systems , the pattern forming wavelength is often proportional to the system size , while the number of stripes or segments is invariant against the change of system size .",
    "for instance , some mammalian coat markings have been shown to enlarge in proportion to system size  @xcite , patterns in some micro organisms like _ hydra _ and _ dictyostelium discoideum _ have also been observed to show proportionality with size  @xcite . modeling this type of biological systems with turing - type reaction - diffusion",
    "therefore requires rendering the governing equations dimensionless and adjusting the system parameters in a proper way  @xcite .",
    "one such approach involves using diffusion constants which depend on the concentration of a system size - dependent auxiliary chemical factor  @xcite or using the possibility that the concentration of some chemical changes with some power of the system size  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to change the length scale of the patterns in the gray - scott model via a simple rescaling of all the involved diffusion coefficients by the same factor , while keeping all the reaction constants unchanged .",
    "we provide a test of the validity of this simple approach with lattice boltzmann simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the lattice boltzmann simulation scheme for reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "we then provide some benchmark tests for our lb simulation by comparing our results with analytical solutions for the transformation reaction and diffusion of a point source in a domain with periodic boundary conditions . excellent agreement with the analytical solutions",
    "we also carry out a truncation error analysis of the model via a third - order multiscale expansion .",
    "results obtained from this analysis are in agreement with our numerical simulations . in section [ sec : gray - scott ] , we present the gray - scott model and , using linear stability analysis , determine the parameter range for the existence of unstable solutions which we identify as a necessary condition for pattern formation .",
    "our numerical simulations show good agreement with the predictions obtained from linear stability analysis .",
    "in section [ sec : scale_inv ] we present a detailed study of the patterns which may be obtained via large amplitude perturbations of a linearly stable state .",
    "this case comprises the self replicating spots .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method  @xcite can be regarded as a mesoscopic particle based numerical approach allowing to solve fluid - dynamical equations in a certain approximation , which ( within , e.g. the so called diffusive scaling , i.e. by choosing @xmath9 ) becomes exact as the grid resolution is progressively increased",

    "[ fig : graph1 ] ( a ) for @xmath68 and fig .",
    "[ fig : graph1 ] ( b ) for @xmath69 .",
    "a heuristic explanation for this follows from the fact that an increase in @xmath41 from 0.01 to 0.033 leads to a 3 times reduction in the time scale for reaction @xmath70 .",

    "figure [ fig : graph1 ] ( c ) shows that the minimum occurs at @xmath65 = 0.012 , for @xmath68 , while increasing @xmath41 to 0.033 leads to a shift in the minimum to @xmath65 = 0.03 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : graph1 ] ( d ) ) . in order to validate the existence of this minimum in this model and characterize the shift observed for an increasing reaction rate ,",
    "we perform a third - order chapman - enskog expansion of the lattice boltzmann bgk model for reaction - diffusion equation ( see the appendix ) and obtain an expression for the truncation error up to the third - order in the expansion parameter @xmath73 .",

[ eq : error ] and  [ eq : damin ] .",

    "self replicating spots occur via large amplitude perturbations of the trivial homogeneous solution .",
    "furthermore , a survey of the parameters entering the scale invariant form of the gray - scott model suggests that the simplest choice to tune the length scale of the obtained patterns ( while keeping its shape unchanged ) is to multiply all the relevant diffusion coefficients with the same constant factor without any modification of the reaction rates .",

    "<S> we apply the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) to study pattern formation in reaction - diffusion systems . as a first methodological step , we consider the case of a single species undergoing transformation reaction and diffusion . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a third - order chapman - enskog multiscale expansion and study the dependence of the lattice boltzmann truncation error on the diffusion coefficient and the reaction rate . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , taking the gray - scott model as a prominent example , we provide evidence for the maturity of the lbm in studying pattern formation in non - linear reaction - diffusion systems . for this purpose , we perform linear stability analysis of the gray - scott model and determine the relevant parameter range for pattern formation . </S>",
    "<S> lattice boltzmann simulations allow not only to test the validity of the linear stability phase diagram including turing and hopf instabilities , but also permit going beyond the linear stability regime , where large perturbations give rise to interesting dynamical behavior such as the so called self replicating spots . we also show that the length scale of the patterns may be tuned by rescaling all relevant diffusion coefficients in the system with the same factor while letting all the reaction constants unchanged . </S>"
