    "the designs for several large telescopes that may get built in the next decade are driven largely by the need for superb and stable image quality over wide fields @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most demanding of the scientific programs that in turn drive these requirements is that of cosmological weak lensing , using galaxy images to measure gravitational shape distortions as small as as one part in ten thousand .    of particular concern for ground - based telescopes",
    "are the rigid body motions of the optical elements due to gravitational and thermal stresses on the telescope structure .",
    "the positions of the optical elements can be controlled only to the extent that they can be measured , putting a premium on the accurate characterization of the aberrations generated by telescope misalignments .    on the assumption that at least some of these aberrations are best measured with wavefront sensors ,",
    "several questions immediately arise .",
    "how many aberrations must be measured ? which ones ? at how many field positions must the measurements be made ?",
    "one can always , as a last resort , attempt to answer these questions by simulation .",
    "but we argue here that the answers to these questions hinge on the identification of generic field aberration patterns that emerge in a wide variety of circumstances .",
    "a relatively small number of such patterns suffices to efficiently diagnose and correct misalignments . and",
    "only a small number of field points must be sampled to measure these patterns .",
    "moreover two of the patterns may in some cases be determined directly from science data .",
    "the practical astronomical literature on the alignment of wide field telescopes is very limited .",

    "the present paper is quite similar in spirit to @xcite : identify those aberration patterns of potential interest and ascertain which are of greatest value in aligning a telescope .",

    "the seidel pattern is a result of the telescope design , and fitting for that pattern provides no information about tilts or decenterings of the mirrors .",
    "in contrast , the magnitude and orientation of the constant coma pattern _ will _ provide information about a telescope s alignment .",
    "following schroeder s ( 1987 ) example for coma , @xcite calculated the corresponding astigmatism pattern for the case of a nulled field constant coma pattern .",

    "by contrast `` zernike '' astigmatism is almost always taken to vary as @xmath33 the seidel definition emerges naturally from the derivation of aberration patterns .",
    "the zernike definition makes for more symmetric wavefronts and orthogonality among the different aberrations .",

    "the tilt and decenter terms have the same functional dependence on pupil coordinates as the symmetric term , but vary linearly with distance from the center of the field @xmath8 , and vary as the cosine and ( or ) sine of the field angle @xmath9 .",
    "we shall again refer loosely to any aberration that has the same dependence upon pupil coordinates as astigmatism , even when it does not have the seidel dependence on field position .",

    "figure  [ fig : astig_s2]b shows the point spread function pattern characteristic of either the tilt or decenter terms in equation .    as with the comatic aberrations , the astigmatic field pattern shown in figure  [ fig : astig_s2]b will in general",
    "be superimposed on the seidel pattern if one is present .",
    "some previous treatments have referred to this superposition of field patterns as a single misalignment pattern ; @xcite describes a single astigmatism pattern , which he symmetrizes in the course of aligning his telescope ; @xcite refers to a binodal astigmatism pattern which results from misalignments . in this paper",
    "we decompose the astigmatism into two patterns , a symmetric one characteristic of an aligned telescope and an asymmetric one introduced by misalignments . the asymmetric pattern described by @xcite and the binodal pattern plotted by @xcite",
    "are produced by superimposing the symmetric and asymmetric patterns in figures  [ fig : astig_s2]a and  [ fig : astig_s2]b .",
    "the nodes are simply field positions where the symmetric seidel and asymmetric misalignment patterns have cancelled .. however , the inclusion of terms that are nonlinear in the misalignment has no effect on the underlying seidel or linear patterns . ]    both for coma and for astigmatism ( and in the cases of the additional aberrations considered below ) the misalignment pattern varies as one power of field radius less rapidly than the corresponding symmetric pattern .",
    "coma and astigmatism are just two of the five third - order seidel aberrations .",
    "curvature of field ( henceforth cof ) manifests itself as a defocus that varies as the square of the distance from the center of an assumed flat focal plane .",
    "@xcite might in principal have used curvature of field ( rather than astigmatism ) to align the whipple 1.2-m , but there is a potential degeneracy with a tilted instrument .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we find an associated wavefront ,    @xmath36    the first term on the right hand side gives the symmetric seidel curvature of field typical of an aligned two mirror telescope , and the next two give the defocus patterns typical of a decenter or tilt of the secondary .",
    "the coefficients @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 again depend upon the radii of curvature , @xmath18 and conic constants , @xmath19 of the two mirrors , the indices of refraction of the air preceding the mirrors , @xmath20 , the positions , @xmath21 and magnifications , @xmath22 of the object for each mirror , and the distance from the primary mirror to the secondary , @xmath23 .",
    "the details of the derivation of the above are given in appendix c.    the seidel term varies as the square of the field radius @xmath8 and varies as @xmath40 on the pupil .",
    "but the dependence on pupil position is exactly the same as that of defocus , which is a first - order aberration .",
    "anticipating the nomenclature introduced in  [ sec : generic_fifth - order ] below , curvature of field might equally well be called `` third - order defocus , '' but we bow to convention . the tilt and decenter terms vary linearly with distance from a line passing through the center of the field , but have the same functional dependence on pupil coordinates .",
    "this is precisely what one would expect for a tilted focal plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : cof_s2]a shows the point spread function at various points in the field for the seidel term in equation .",
    "figure [ fig : cof_s2]b shows the point spread function pattern introduced by either the tilt or decenter terms in equation .",
    "while distortion is one of the five seidel aberrations , for many purposes it can be neglected , since it does not degrade image quality .",
    "distortion does , however alter the positions of images in the field , and of particular interest for the measurements of weak gravitational lensing , it changes the shapes of extended objects . and",
    "most importantly for the present discussion it may be of some use in aligning a telescope .    following the conventions of @xcite and @xcite , we find the associated wavefront delay for a misaligned two mirror telescope :    @xmath41    the seidel term on the right varies as the cube of field angle @xmath8 and as @xmath42 and ( or ) @xmath43 on the pupil .",
    "distortion differs from coma , astigmatism and curvature of field in having two distinct misalignment aberration patterns rather than only one",
    ". we will encounter several similar pairs of misalignment aberration patterns when we consider fifth - order misalignment patterns in  4 .",
    "the two terms are distinguished by whether the direction of the tilt , @xmath13 or decenter , @xmath44 enters in a dot product with the field position , @xmath7 or the pupil position , @xmath4 .",
    "we use `` @xmath8 '' and `` @xmath5 '' to label the two alternatives .",
    "the @xmath8 terms have the same functional dependence on pupil coordinates as the seidel term , but are proportional to the square of the field angle @xmath8 and the cosine of its polar coordinate , @xmath9 .",
    "these produce a field distortion pattern directed radially outward , but with a magnitude that depends on the product of the field angle and its projection onto the decenter or tilt .",
    "the @xmath5 terms also have the same functional dependence on pupil coordinates as the first , but vary only as the square field angle @xmath8 .",
    "the direction of the distortion is that of the decenter or tilt , but its magnitude increases outward as the square of the distance from the center of the field .",
    "the three distortion patterns are shown in figure  [ fig : distortion_s2 ] .",
    "details of the derivation of the coefficients are given in appendix d.    each of the two distinct misalignment distortion patterns is characterized by a two - vector .",
    "were one able to measure those vectors with the same accuracy as the two - vectors that characterize coma and astigmatism one might in principle use _ only _ distortion measurements to align a two mirror telescope .",
    "spherical aberration is the fifth of the seidel aberrations and is constant across the field .",
    "tilts and decenters do not produce asymmetric spherical aberration patterns .",
    "in the preceding subsections the third - order aberrations were cast so as to display explicitly the azimuthal dependence upon pupil position , @xmath4 and field angle , @xmath45 .",
    "these can be recast more compactly and transparently in vector form .",
    "for example the seidel distortion term above varies as @xmath46 .",
    "suppose a single mirror @xmath47 serves as its own pupil .",
    "the wavefront delay @xmath48 for a ray that intercepts the mirror at position @xmath49 and that makes an angle @xmath50 with the axis of the mirror is given by for the position on the pupil when the optic is despaced from the pupil . ]",
    "@xmath51    where @xmath52 is the spherical aberration coefficient , @xmath53 is the coma coefficient , @xmath54 is the astigmatism coefficient , @xmath55 is the curvature of field coefficient , and @xmath56 is the distortion coefficient .",
    "these aberration coefficients depend only on the curvature of the mirror , @xmath57 , the conic constant of the mirror , @xmath58 , the magnification of the mirror , @xmath59 , the position of the object for the mirror , @xmath60 , and the index of refraction immediately preceding the mirror , @xmath61 ) will encounter a negative index of refraction ( @xmath62 ) once reflected and traveling towards the secondary . therefore , although this discussion deals primarily with mirrors and thin lenses , the index of the refraction of the material surrounding the optics can not be entirely ignored . ] . in ",
    "5.1 of his book @xcite shows that the aberrations which vary linearly with ray height on the optic must be zero for conic section optics which serve as their own pupils .",
    "we therefore set @xmath56 to zero and ignore it in the following discussion .",
    "the values for the other coefficients are given in table [ tab : wklm ] .",
    "@cccc @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 +    following @xcite , one finds that if the pupil is offset by @xmath23 along the axis of the mirror , the position at which a ray lands on the mirror , @xmath49 depends upon its position on the pupil , @xmath67 and the angle the chief ray makes to the pupil normal , @xmath68 ( which is defined to be the field angle ) , and upon @xmath23 .",
    "the angle that the ray makes with the axis of the mirror , @xmath50 depends upon field angle @xmath68 and the pupil offset , @xmath23 .    if the mirror is tilted by angle @xmath69 , it changes the angle @xmath50 that a ray makes with the mirror s axis .",
    "and if the mirror is decentered from the optical axis ( which is perpendicular to and centered on the pupil ) by @xmath70 , it changes both the position at which a ray lands on the mirror , @xmath71 and the angle @xmath50 that the ray makes with respect to the mirror s axis .",
    "the net effect of a pupil offset or a misalignment of the mirror relative to the pupil is to shift the position @xmath49 at which a given ray strikes the mirror and to change the angle @xmath72 that the ray makes with the axis of the mirror .",
    "the transformations from pupil coordinates , @xmath67 and field angle , @xmath7 to mirror coordinates and mirror angle for a mirror despaced by an amount @xmath23 and decentered and tilted by @xmath73 and @xmath74 are then , decenters , @xmath70 and tilts , @xmath69 of an optic as displacements , decenters , and tilts of the flat surface defined by the plane containing the vertex of that optic .",
    "this is equivalent to using a first order approximation of pupil and field coordinates .",
    "while this assumption reproduces the stop shift formulae given in @xcite and @xcite , it is not strictly correct in the cases of large or very curved mirrors , large fields , or cases where the stop is quite close to the optic . in particular ,",
    "when a telescope s primary mirror is the aperture stop , the computed aberrations are only correct when @xmath23 for the primary mirror is set equal to zero , even though the physical aperture is defined by the edge of the optic , which may actually be a finite distance from the optic s vertex . setting @xmath23 equal to zero in this special case is natural , as equation completely describes the aberrations introduced by an optic that is its own pupil , without any need for modification .",
    "however , this inconsistency would seem to indicate that the assumptions that predicate equations and may need to be modified in order to compute higher order aberrations . ]",
    "@xmath75    an offset of the pupil from the mirror by an amount @xmath23 causes what was seidel spherical aberration to manifest itself as a combination of spherical aberration , coma , astigmatism , curvature of field and distortion , all of which have the symmetric seidel field dependence .",
    "likewise what was coma manifests itself as a combination of coma , astigmatism , curvature of field and distortion .",
    "this cascade downward from spherical to coma to astigmatism and curvature of field and finally to distortion is embodied in the `` stop shift '' formulae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "decenterings and tilts of the mirror relative to the pupil also produce cascades . for an axially symmetric telescope we may assume that these tilts and decenters are small and ignore terms that are quadratic and higher in either or both . in the aberration patterns associated with the surviving linear terms ,",
    "a field angle vector @xmath68 is replaced by either a tilt , @xmath69 or a decenter , @xmath76 .",
    "the field angle exponents for the misalignment aberration patterns are therefore smaller by one than those of the corresponding seidel aberrations .",
    "table [ tab:3rd_order ] gives aberration patterns that arise when a mirror is offset by @xmath23 with respect to its pupil , and decentered and tilted by small amounts .",
    "the different signs for odd and even numbered mirrors arise from the fact that the chief ray for a given optic may be traveling in the opposite angular direction than the chief ray on the pupil for the primary mirror , which here determines the field angle @xmath7 .",
    "put otherwise , the sign accounts for the fact that preceding mirrors flipped the images .",

    "we would treat the aperture stop as a third optical element and analyze this telescope configuration as a three mirror telescope .",
    "@xcite measures coma and astigmatism in his two mirror telescope .",
    "he might in principle have used the two distortion patterns , but these would require a high precision astrometric catalog ( perhaps using galaxy positions to avoid the effects of stellar proper motions ) .",
    "moreover as the misalignment distortion patterns vary as a higher powers of field angle than the misalignment astigmatism and coma patterns , they might be expected to have smaller amplitudes .",
    "mcleod might also have used curvature of field , although here there is the danger that the detector might be tilted with respect to the primary . or ,",
    "had he been feeling particularly masochistic , he might have measured all five patterns , for the sake of redundancy .    with their folding flats , the magellan telescopes in their nasmyth configuration qualify as 2.5-mirror telescopes .",
    "one need not worry about the decentering of the tertiary but one must measure and correct for its tilt , @xmath145 .",
    "the alignment procedure described by @xcite adds the curvature of field misalignment pattern ( equivalent to a focal plane tilt ) to those of coma and astigmatism .",
    "calculating the aberration patterns for a 3-mirror telescope ( say a three mirror anastigmat , henceforth a tma ) is not quite twice as difficult as for a 2-mirror telescope .",
    "one applies table [ tab:3rd_order ] to the tertiary and finds misalignment patterns that depend upon the decenter @xmath146 and tilt @xmath147 of the tertiary . if the stop is coincident with the primary , only the secondary and tertiary contribute to the five third - order misalignment patterns in table [ tab:3rd_order ] .",
    "the patterns are linear in the decenter and tilt vectors , so that the combined wavefront gives the same five patterns , each characterized by a new pattern 2-vector .",
    "each pattern 2-vector , @xmath148 , is a linear combination of the four misalignment 2-vectors , the tilts @xmath149 and @xmath145 , and the decenterings @xmath150 and @xmath151 . likewise if the stop is coincident with the secondary or tertiary mirrors , only tilts and decenters of the other two mirrors contribute .",
    "if coma , astigmatism and curvature of field are the only aberrations that adversely affect science , there is a two - dimensional `` subspace of benign misalignment '' for which the coma , astigmatism and curvature of field misalignment patterns are all zero in the limit of small misalignments .",
    "but if one does not bring additional information to bear , one runs the risk of drifting increasingly far from perfect alignment .",
    "this would produce large misalignment distortion , and ultimately , fifth - order misalignment patterns and third - order patterns that depend quadratically on the mirror tilts and decenters .    to measure the misalignment distortion patterns one would need either overlapping fields of images @xcite or pre - existing astrometry .",
    "if one uses overlapping fields , one risks changing the misalignment between pointings , thus rendering distortion of limited use for measuring alignment at a given pointing .",
    "if one relies on pre - existing astrometry , the accuracy with which the distortion patterns could be measured would then be limited by the accuracy of the astrometric catalog .",
    "moreover , regardless the technique used to measure the aberrations , the misalignment distortion patterns might be expected to have smaller amplitudes than misalignment astigmatism and coma as the misalignment distortion patterns vary as a higher power of field angle .",
    "this raises the question of whether one might use fifth - order aberration patterns to keep the telescope aligned .",

    "they have the same angular dependence , but exhibit a different radial dependence .",
    "once again , the ability to distinguish between the fifth - order defocus misalignment pattern and the curvature of field misalignment pattern depends critically upon the sampling of the field rather than the wavefront .",
    "the literature on fifth - order aberrations is limited for several reasons .",
    "first , by their very nature , they tend to be smaller than the third - order ( seidel ) aberrations .",
    "second , they are rather cumbersome . as a matter of course ,",
    "ray tracing programs handle them correctly , so as a matter of practice , they receive little attention .",
    "but as we have seen in the previous section , fifth - order aberrations may be needed to keep a three - mirror telescope aligned , and would almost certainly be needed to keep a four - mirror telescope aligned .",
    "conversely , if one uses only the more commonly measured third - order aberrations , coma , astigmatism , and cof , to keep a telescope aligned , there are degenerate telescope configurations that zero out these third - order misalignment aberrations and yet produce distortion and fifth - order misalignment aberrations .",
    "it is therefore of some interest to estimate which of these might be more or less substantial .",
    "an order of magnitude argument can be made by noting that the entries in table [ tab:5th_order ] are homogeneous and of sixth order in the sum of the exponents of the pupil radius and the field angle .",
    "both of these are rendered dimensionless by the focal lengths .",
    "we would argue that it is the focal ratio of the fastest element that matters most in such considerations .",
    "modern fast , wide field telescopes have primary f - ratios approaching unity , while the field angles are rarely greater than a tenth of a radian . by this argument",
    "the terms at the top of table [ tab:5th_order ] would be larger than those at the bottom .",
    "third- and fifth - order aberrations for three specific optical systems : the lsst , het corrector , and a magellan - like telescope , are analyzed in the following subsections .",

    "thesis @xcite carried out at the university of arizona .",
    "@xcite analyzed the off - axis aberrations for two telescopes in terms of patterns derived in thompson s unpublished @xcite phd thesis .",
    "but instead of computing the amplitudes of the patterns according to the principles set forth by @xcite , he used ray - tracing software to produce wavefronts across the field for various misalignments .",
    "he then fit these wavefronts to the expected patterns .    of particular relevance for the present work",
    ", he analyzed an early version of the large synoptic survey telescope ( @xcite ; henceforth lsst ) in which the tertiary and primary were independent ( rather than fabricated from a single monolith , as with the ultimate design ) .",
    "he applied decenters and tilts to the secondary and tertiary ( and to the corrector assembly ) and decomposed the computed wavefronts into the third- and fifth - order aberration patterns .",
    "results of those calculations are given in table [ tab : tessieres ] , which show the effects of tilts in the secondary and tertiary .",
    "each entry gives the amplitude of the aberration at the edge of the field and at the edge of the pupil , in microns , for one degree of tilt .",
    "up to factors of order unity the rms spot size will be proportional to these .",
    "the first impression one gets is that the third - order aberrations are factors of 30 - 300 larger than the fifth - order aberrations .",
    "a consequence of this disparity is that , to the extent that the fifth - order and third - order aberration patterns are correlated , a small relative error in a measurement of a third - order aberration pattern will produce a large relative error in the corresponding fifth - order aberration pattern .",
    "this bodes ill for using fifth - order aberrations for telescope alignment .",
    "@xcite calculations are themselves not entirely immune from such errors , but @xcite had the luxury of measuring the wavefront with high precision at a large number of points in the field .",
    "there are several patterns for which @xcite did not report amplitudes ",
    "fifth - order astigmatism-@xmath8 and the @xmath5 patterns for fifth - order coma and astigmatism for the secondary mirror .",

    "the next order aberration intrinsic to the aligned telescope ( seventh - order spherical , seventh - order second coma , and seventh - order second spherical ) is of a similar magnitude or greater than the symmetric fifth - order aberration .",
    "fortunately for telescope alignment , the corresponding seventh - order misalignment aberrations are smaller than the fifth - order misalignment aberrations .",
    "in  [ sec : generic_patterns ] and  [ sec : generic_fifth - order ] we showed that telescope misalignments produce a finite and relatively small set of distinct aberration patterns , each of which is characterized by a two - vector .",
    "the degrees of freedom that produce these patterns are likewise finite and small in number .",
    "suppose that we have an @xmath0-mirror telescope with @xmath61 wavefront sensors distributed throughout the field each capable of measuring @xmath59 aberrations .",
    "we take the position and pointing of the telescope to be defined by one of the mirrors .",
    "there remain @xmath210 tilts and @xmath210 decenters , each of which is described by a two - vector , that can produce our misalignment aberration patterns .",
    "if the aberration patterns are linearly independent , one would need to measure and correct @xmath1 misalignment patterns to keep the telescope aligned .      for",
    "a 3-mirror telescope one would certainly measure the coma , astigmatism , and curvature of field patterns , since these produce the largest aberrations .",
    "the choice of a fourth pattern is much less obvious , but for the sake of the present exposition , we choose trefoil ( despite its relatively small amplitude compared to several other fifth order aberrations ) .",
    "coma , astigmatism and trefoil each have two independent components on the pupil : one that varies as @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively and another that varies as @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 respectively .",
    "thus , if the seidel patterns and effects of despace errors and mirror deformations are well - constrained , one wavefront sensor alone will suffice to measure the two - vectors for the misalignment aberration patterns associated with these .",
    "by contrast , defocus is radially symmetric on the pupil , and each wavefront sensor produces only one number .",
    "two wavefront sensors suffice to measure the curvature of field pattern , provided that they are not diametrically opposed .",
    "the situation is complicated by despace ( piston ) errors which produce the symmetric aberration patterns characteristic of aligned but incompletely corrected telescopes .",
    "one would certainly want to measure and correct the first - order defocus that this produces , but this demands a third wavefront sensor to distinguish between simple ( uniform ) defocus and curvature of field .",
    "one possible arrangement of these three wavefront sensors would be to space the wavefront sensors around the periphery of the field , where the effects of the misalignments are largest .",
    "an alternative would be to have one wavefront sensor at the center of the field and two at the periphery , but not co - linear .",
    "as there are two degrees of freedom for despace errors , one must measure a second field - symmetric pattern in addition to defocus .",
    "the three candidate patterns are coma , astigmatism and spherical aberration .",
    "only two wavefront sensors are needed to distinguish between the third - order misalignment coma and the symmetric coma pattern characteristic of a telescope with despace errors .",
    "the same holds true for astigmatism .",
    "the three wavefront sensors needed to distinguish uniform defocus and curvature of field therefore provide information about both despace errors .",
    "in addition , one would obtain three measurements of spherical aberration , which at third order is constant across the field .",
    "our naive scheme has one major strength and one major weakness .",
    "the strength is that the aberrations are low order on the pupil .",
    "wavefront sensors work by subdividing the pupil and making measurements on those elements .",
    "the more finely one subdivides the pupil , the more light is needed .",
    "moreover , high - order aberrations are likely to be small , so there is little danger of our low order aberrations being corrupted by covariances with higher order aberrations .",
    "finally , for the case of wavefront sensors based on out - of - focus images , image overlap is less of a problem if one can work with images that are more nearly in focus , which this method allows .",
    "the substantial weakness in our scheme is the use of trefoil , which , as we have noted , would appear to produce a substantially smaller signal than some of the other fifth - order misalignment aberrations .",
    "tessieres results , shown in table 3 , would suggest second coma as an alternative to trefoil . but as is evident if figure 7 , the point spread functions for second coma and ordinary ( third order ) coma are quite similar to each other . and",
    "the misalignment patterns , shown in figures 2 and 8 , are identical .",
    "so one would need to sample the pupil well in order to distinguish between the two .",
    "coma and second coma vary , respectively , as @xmath217 and @xmath174 .",

    "of the two alternative arrangements described in our naive approach , the one with all three wavefront sensors on the periphery fails to discriminate between the fifth - order @xmath5-coma pattern and the third - order misalignment coma pattern .",
    "by contrast the arrangement with one at the center and two non - colinear on the periphery _ does _ successfully discriminate among all three patterns .",
    "one can still use only peripheral wavefront sensors as long as one was careful to include the contributions of misalignments to both the third - order coma pattern and fifth - order @xmath5-pattern . in solving for the misalignments , one might iterate , ignoring @xmath5-coma on the first iteration and then subtracting it off on subsequent iterations . but this would preclude counting @xmath5-coma as one of the @xmath1 needed patterns .",
    "the same arguments hold for the three misalignment astigmatism patterns as well .",
    "a strictly peripheral arrangement of wavefront can not distinguish between the third - order misalignment astigmatism pattern and the fifth - order @xmath5 pattern .",
    "one could alternately choose to neglect fifth - order aberrations and instead use pointing or distortion to maintain alignment in a three mirror telescope .",
    "tilt ( or pointing ) is one of only two first - order aberrations . as its name implies , pointing uniformly shifts the location of every object in the field .",
    "it does not alter an image s point spread function and so it can not be measured with a wavefront sensor unless the position of that wavefront sensor in the image plane is accurately known . in a paper on the advanced solar telescope ,",

    "this method would require accurate measurement of the position of the detector with respect to one of the mirrors .",
    "in the same way that spherical aberration might equally well have been called `` second defocus ''  the two have same dependence upon pupil azimuth  distortion might equally well have been called `` second tilt . '' for a field with a pre - existing astrometric catalog , misalignment distortion can be measured directly from the science data or using two wavefront sensors whose positions are accurately determined . in the absence of a pre - existing catalog , one might also solve for the misalignment distortion patterns by comparing overlapping fields , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the distortion terms would then constrain four degrees of freedom of telescope misalignments .      both wavefront sensor arrangements adopted for",
    "our naive approach to the 3-mirror telescope suffice to keep it aligned , but not for the same reasons . for the arrangement with three peripheral wavefront sensors ,",
    "either the @xmath8-coma and @xmath8-astigmatism is likely to give a stronger alignment signal than the trefoil pattern .    alternatively , for the arrangement with one wavefront sensor at the center and two non - colinear sensors on the periphery",
    ", the @xmath5-coma and @xmath5-astigmatism can also be used .",
    "this would seem to give sufficient information to keep a 4-mirror telescope aligned , or a 3-mirror telescope with a corrector .",

    "if the stop is coincident with one of the mirrors , then the deformations of that mirror have the same effect on the wavefront at every point in the field .",
    "but if not , deformations of a mirror will project onto different parts of the pupil at different points in the field .",
    "applying the same mirror deformation pattern to different mirrors will produce aberrated wavefronts that are offset with respect to each other .",
    "one must therefore sample the wavefront at relatively high density to ascertain which element is deformed .    among the fifth - order aberrations ,",
    "second - coma , second - astigmatism and fifth - order spherical likewise require good sampling of the pupil to distinguish their misalignment patterns from those of third order aberrations .",
    "the accuracy with which one might determine these fifth - order aberrations is diminished by the need to use the same information to determine the mirror deformations .",
    "this would argue for using two kinds of wavefront sensors : low - order sensors , using only coma , astigmatism and defocus to correct the rigid body motions , and high - order sensors to correct for mirror deformations .",
    "these latter sensors might be run at lower cadence than the former , except perhaps immediately following a large change in telescope pointing .",
    "in such a scheme one might still measure fifth - order misalignment coma and fifth - order misalignment astigmatism with the low - order wavefront sensors , provided that there are a sufficient number of such sensors .",
    "if the telescope is then properly aligned the second - coma and second - astigmatism misalignment patterns will be zeroed out on the high - order wavefront sensors , giving a cleaner measurement of the mirror deformations in the high - order sensors .",
    "many wide field telescope designs have a large central obscuration . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : wfs ] , this would make it more difficult to distinguish between second coma and second astigmatism on the one hand and ordinary coma and astigmatism on the other , which in third - order have the same field pattern",
    ". the smaller range of pupil radii would increase correlated errors .",
    "we have until this point avoided the question of how one knows the position of one s wavefront sensors or one s field with respect to one or another of a telescope s mirrors . as noted in the discussion of pointing in the previous subsection , the position and tilt of the focal plane or wavefront sensors",
    "might be determined mechanically or interferometrically .",
    "but if not , and if one wishes to correct for focal plane misalignments , one must measure two additional aberration patterns , one for the tilt of the focal plane , and one for the decenter .",
    "a tilted detector produces a field pattern identical to misalignment curvature of field . however , if that pattern is used to correct the detector tilt , it can not also be used to keep the mirrors aligned .",
    "a decentered focal plane creates no aberrations of its own , but as is discussed in   [ sec : aligning_2.5-mirror ] , it can cause seidel or fifth - order aligned aberrations to masquerade as misalignment aberrations . measuring telescope aberrations relative to an incorrect field center will produce spurious misalignment aberrations even if the telescope is otherwise aligned .",
    "one can choose to fit for this focal plane decenter by measuring an additional field pattern .",
    "if it is not feasible to measure an additional field pattern and one assumes that the center of the detector is the center of pointing , he can still completely null the measured misalignment coma , astigmatism and curvature of field by tilting and decentering one of the mirrors and tilting the focal plane . compensating for the detector decenter with mirror misalignments can put the telescope into a state of ` benign misalignment ' ,",
    "where only the smaller aberrations patterns : misalignment distortion , the fifth - order misalignment aberrations , and the aberrations which vary as the square of misalignments are present .      in his treatment",
    "of the lsst , @xcite studies the effects of tilts and decenters on a focal plane assembly consisting of a multi - element corrector and the focal plane array .",
    "two additional patterns are needed to keep this assembly aligned .",
    "interestingly , the fifth - order aberration patterns produced by these tilts and decenters are larger , compared to the third - order aberration patterns , than for the secondary and tertiary mirrors .",
    "at least three of the generic misalignment aberration patterns described in the previous sections are currently used to align wide - field telescopes , and there may soon be reason to use more of them . ignoring for the present , the question of whether or not to use distortion we imagine here an @xmath0-mirror telescope with @xmath61 wavefront sensors distributed throughout the field each capable of measuring @xmath59 aberrations .",
    "one must determine @xmath210 tilts and @xmath210 decenters , each of which is described by a two - vector .",
    "the most straightforward and transparent approach is to analyze each wavefront sensor separately , determining the coefficients of the aberrations at each of @xmath59 points in the field .",
    "one then fits the these coefficients to a linear combinations of the misalignment aberration patterns described in the previous section and finally fits the amplitudes of the misalignment patterns ( assuming one has measured more patterns than one actually needs ) .",
    "a complication of this approach is that at each step the quantities for which one is fitting may be correlated with each other .",
    "aberration coefficients will be correlated , pattern amplitudes will be correlated and tilts and decenters will be correlated . under such circumstances",
    "one must be careful to fit for all correlated quantities ; otherwise one runs the risk of introducing systematic errors in the quantities for which one does fit .      instead of measuring the aberrations at each point in the field , one might fit the data for all @xmath61 wavefront sensors simultaneously to determine the amplitudes of the misalignment aberration patterns",
    "this has the advantage of eliminating the problem of correlated aberrations at each point , but unmodelled aberrations may then lead to systematic errors .",
    "one might also fit directly for the tilts and decenters , short - circuiting the misalignment aberration patterns except for using them to turn tilts and decenters into predicted wavefronts that are then compared with observed wavefronts .",
    "this reduces the number of parameters for which one fits and implicitly accounts for the correlations of aberration pattern amplitudes . rather than fitting for poorly determined amplitudes of fifth - order aberration patterns ,",
    "all of the fifth - order dependence is attributed to a smaller number of tilts and decenters , which are strongly constrained by the third - order aberration patterns .",
    "finally one might dispense entirely with the decomposition of the wavefront into specific aberrations and instead use ray tracing to determine how it varies at each measured point . while this obviates the need for misalignment patterns , it sacrifices all understanding of why one might need @xmath61 wavefront sensors with enough resolution to measure @xmath59 aberrations .",
    "we have derived and illustrated the generic third - order aberration patterns that arise when the axial symmetry of a telescope is broken by small misalignments of optical elements .",
    "there are five patterns : one each for coma , astigmatism and curvature of field and two for distortion .",
    "each of these misalignment patterns is characterized by an associated two - dimensional vector .",
    "these two - vectors are in turn linear combinations of the tilt and decenter vectors of the individual optical elements .    for an @xmath0-mirror telescope , @xmath1 patterns must be measured to keep the telescope aligned . for @xmath2 , as in a three mirror anastigmat , there is a two - dimensional `` subspace of benign misalignment '' over which the misalignment patterns for third - order coma , astigmatism and curvature of field are identically zero . if pre - existing astrometry is available , one or both of the distortion patterns may be used to keep the telescope aligned .",
    "alternatively , one might measure one of the fifth - order misalignment patterns .",
    "we have illustrated the generic fifth - order misalignment patterns that arise from small misalignments .",
