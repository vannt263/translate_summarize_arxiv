    "magnetic fields in astrophysical systems are usually generated in a broad interval of scales , ranging from small resistive scales to large scales exceeding the correlation length of plasma motions .",
    "one of the most important , challenging and still open questions in astrophysics is how cosmic magnetic fields have been generated and what is their structure .",
    "the prevailing theory for the origin of magnetic fields is dynamo action , which is stretching of magnetic field lines by random motion of highly conducting plasmas or fluids in which these lines are frozen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "small - scale magnetic fields , that is fields at the scales smaller than the velocity field scales , are generally expected under this mechanism , while large - scale magnetic fields , correlated at scales larger than the correlation scale of a velocity field , can be generated if some additional conditions are met , such as the condition that the velocity field @xmath0 is not mirror symmetric , say , possesses nonzero kinetic helicity @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "assume that the velocity fluctuations have the typical correlation scale  @xmath2 , and the typical rms value  @xmath3 , and the plasma has kinematic viscosity  @xmath4 and magnetic diffusivity  @xmath5 ( the latter is proportional to electrical resistivity ) .",
    "the range of scales available for velocity and magnetic fluctuations can be characterized by the reynolds number @xmath6 and the magnetic reynolds number @xmath7 , respectively . in astrophysical applications",
    "both numbers are very large ( for example , in a protogalaxy , where dynamo action is believed to operate , @xmath8 and @xmath9 reach values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) . their ratio , the magnetic prandtl number @xmath12 can be either large or small .",
    "for example , in galaxies and galaxy clusters @xmath13 , while in planets and stellar interiors @xmath14 .",
    "because of the vast range of scales available for magnetic and velocity fluctuations , and generally strongly disparate magnetic and velocity dissipation scales , present - day direct numerical simulations can not directly address astrophysical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) regimes .",
    "indeed , maximal reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers accessible with numerical simulations are hopelessly small , of the order of @xmath15 , in which case the typical magnetic prandtl numbers are not significantly different from @xmath16 .",
    "a physical picture of magnetic dynamo action and an effective analytic framework for investigating astrophysical dynamo action are therefore in demand .",
    "the first step in understanding dynamo action is to understand the initial , kinematic stage of magnetic field amplification . in this regime ,",
    "the magnetic field is weak and does not affect the velocity fluctuations .",
    "magnetic field evolution is therefore fully described by the induction equation in which the velocity field is prescribed independently of the magnetic field .",
    "an effective framework in this case is provided by the so - called kazantsev - kraichnan model , where the velocity field is assumed to be a random gaussian short - time - correlated field .",
    "this formal simplification allows for analytic solutions of the model while capturing the essential physics of the phenomenon .",
    "we should note however that even with this simplification the model is nontrivial and its general solution is not known .",
    "only certain special cases have been solved so far , which reveal a good agreement with numerical simulations in the parameter range accessible to numerics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the kazantsev - kraichnan dynamo model allows one to answer the fundamental questions concerning the possibility of turbulent dynamo action for given reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers , the spectrum of growing magnetic fluctuations , the conditions for large - scale magnetic field amplification , etc . in many instances ,",
    "the results obtained in high - resolution numerical simulations were predicted by the model well before such simulations become available .",
    "we therefore believe that the model can provide a valuable insight into astrophysical dynamo regimes that can hardly be accessed through direct numerical simulations in foreseeable future .",
    "our preliminary results aimed at the full numerical characterization of the kinematic dynamo action in the kazantsev - kraichnan framework were presented in  @xcite . in particular , we investigated the growth rates of magnetic fluctuations in the velocity field with the kolmogorov energy spectrum .",
    "in the present paper , we explore the spatial structure of the growing magnetic eigenmodes .",
    "we assume the kolmogorov spectrum of velocity fluctuations and address extremely large reynolds numbers , up to  @xmath17 .",
    "this allows us to study astrophysically relevant limits of very large and very small magnetic prandtl numbers . for completeness",
    ", we perform our analysis for the cases of both large and small kinetic helicity . in the helical case",
    "we also discuss the relevance of the conventional @xmath18-model for the description of large - scale dynamo action , in the case when small - scale magnetic fluctuations are amplified as well .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the kazantsev - kraichnan model of kinematic dynamo action . in section  3",
    ", we present our results , and in section  4 we give our conclusions .",
    "kinematic dynamo action is described by the induction equation for the magnetic field : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity field , @xmath21 is the magnetic field , and @xmath5 is the magnetic diffusivity . in this equation",
    "the velocity field is prescribed independently of the magnetic field . following @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we assume that the velocity field is statistically homogeneous and isotropic and has a gaussian distribution with zero mean , @xmath22 , and the following covariance tensor ( * x*,t)v^j(*x*,t ) = ^ij(*x*-*x*)(t - t ) , [ v_v_tensor ] where @xmath23 is an isotropic tensor of turbulent diffusivity , ^ij(*x*)=_n ( ^ij-)+ _ l + g^ijkx^k .",
    "[ kappa ] here , functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 describe kinetic energy and helicity , @xmath26 , brackets @xmath27 denote ensemble average , @xmath28 is the unit antisymmetric pseudotensor and summation over repeated indices is assumed .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ kappa ] ) represent the mirror - symmetric , nonhelical part , while the last term describes the helical part of the velocity fluctuations . for an incompressible velocity field ( the only case we consider here )",
    ", we have @xmath29 , where the prime denotes derivative with respect to  @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , to describe the velocity field , we specify only two independent functions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the fourier transformation of equation  ( [ kappa ] ) is ^ij(*k*)=f(k)(^ij- ) + ig(k)^ijlk^l .",
    "[ kappa_fourier ] functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be obtained from functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and vice versa , by using the three - dimensional fourier transforms  @xcite .",
    "the correlator of homogeneous and isotropic magnetic field can similarly be expressed as @xmath32 where the field solenoidality constraint @xmath33 implies @xmath34 . to fully describe the magnetic field correlator , we need to find only two functions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , corresponding to magnetic energy and magnetic helicity .",
    "the fourier transformed version of equation  ( [ b_b_tensor ] ) is b^i(*k*,t)b^*j(*k*,t)= f_b(k , t)(^ij- ) - i^ijlk^l , [ magnetic_spectra ] where @xmath37 is the magnetic energy spectral function , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the spectral function of the electric current helicity , @xmath40 .",
    "the problem is then to find the correlation function ( equation  ( [ b_b_tensor ] ) ) of the magnetic field , or , alternatively , its fourier version ( equation  ( [ magnetic_spectra ] ) ) .",
    "suppose that the velocity field ( equations  ( [ v_v_tensor ] ) and  ( [ kappa ] ) ) is given , i.e. , kinetic energy  @xmath24 and kinetic helicity  @xmath25 are given . in this case , to find the properties of the growing magnetic field driven by helical dynamo action , one needs to solve two coupled partial differential equations for functions @xmath41 and @xmath36 related to magnetic energy and magnetic helicity .",
    "such equations were first derived by @xcite . due to their complexity , there have been few theoretical results obtained for the helical dynamo  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". for direct numerical simulations see @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , it has been established in @xcite that @xcite equations also possess a self - adjoint structure , which is similar to a two - component quantum mechanical `` spinor '' form with imaginary time .",
    "these two coupled self - adjoint differential equations are linear and homogeneous , and they describe the growth of the magnetic field in the kazantsev - kraichnan model with nonzero kinetic helicity .",
    "we solve them numerically by the fourth - order runge - kutta integration method and by matching the numerical solution to the analytical asymptotic solutions at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for details see @xcite .",
    "we are interested in fast exponentially growing eigenmodes of the magnetic field amplified by helical kinematic dynamo .",
    "therefore , both magnetic correlator functions @xmath41 and @xmath36 are assumed to be proportional to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the growth rates of the field eigenmodes .",
    "it is important that @xcite helical dynamo equations , which we solve , are self - adjoint because this guarantees that all growth rates @xmath45 are real .",
    "it turns out that in analogy with quantum mechanics , there are two types of magnetic field eigenmodes : bound ( spatially localized ) and unbound ( spatially nonlocalized ) .",
    "first , for growth rates @xmath46 $ ] the eigenfunctions are bound and correspond to `` particles '' trapped by the potential provided by velocity fluctuations .",
    "the bound eigenmodes have discrete growth rates , i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the bound eigenfunctions decline exponentially to zero as @xmath43 .",
    "second , for @xmath49 the eigenfunctions are unbound and correspond to `` traveling particles '' .",
    "the unbound eigenmodes have continuous eigenvalues of their growth rates , @xmath50 .",
    "the unbound eigenfunctions asymptotically become a mixture of cosine and sine standing waves as @xmath43 .",
    "eigenvalue @xmath51 corresponds to the fastest growing unbound eigenmode .",
    "the structure and other properties of the magnetic field amplified by dynamo action are fully determined by all growing eigenmodes of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular , the magnetic energy spectral function @xmath37 is the sum over all energy spectral eigenfunctions ,    [ f_b ] in this equation @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy spectral eigenfunctions for the bound and unbound eigenmodes , respectively ; coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 depend on the seed magnetic field at the initial moment when dynamo started to operate . stays always positive",
    ", the individual energy spectral eigenfunctions can be negative .",
    "the sharp declines in individual eigenfunctions @xmath56 and @xmath57 plotted in figures  [ figure_2 ] and  [ figure_3 ] are due to the logarithmic representation of the eigenfunctions in these figures , which has difficulty to suit with values @xmath58 and @xmath59 . ] similarly to equation  ( [ f_b ] ) , the electric current helicity spectral function @xmath39 is the sum over all helicity spectral eigenfunctions with the same coefficients as in equation  ( [ f_b ] ) . to find the correlation function of the magnetic field ,",
    "it is sufficient to find all growth rates and the corresponding spectral eigenfunctions .",
    "to study a case relevant to astrophysical systems , we consider velocity correlation tensor ( equation  ( [ kappa_fourier ] ) ) with the kolmogorov power velocity spectrum and large reynolds number , @xmath60 . in the kolmogorov turbulence ,",
    "the turbulent diffusivity , given by equation  ( [ kappa ] ) , scales as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the kolmogorov scaling implies @xmath63 . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and therefore    lcl f(k)&=&k^-13/3 , + g(k)&=&-hk^-1f(k ) ,    2kk_max .",

    ", function @xmath25 can not be chosen arbitrarily , its fourier image must satisfy the realizability condition @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "this results in the condition @xmath69 .",
    "analogously , given @xmath41 , function @xmath72 is restricted by condition @xmath73 . ]    we choose magnetic diffusivity to be @xmath74 , corresponding to magnetic reynolds number @xmath75 . by changing the value of the turbulence cutoff wavenumber @xmath76 in equation  ( [ power_v ] )",
    ", we vary the reynolds number @xmath77 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath78 .",
    "we study two cases for the prandtl number : a case when it is large and a case when it is small . in the first case , @xmath79 , which is achieved by choosing @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . in the second case , @xmath82 , which corresponds to our choice @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "these two cases of large and small prandtl numbers are considered in combination with two cases for the kinetic helicity : first , a case when @xmath85 in equation  ( [ power_v ] ) and the velocity field is maximally helical and second , a case when @xmath86 and the kinetic helicity is small .",
    "thus , in total we consider four cases for our choice of the prandtl number @xmath87 and the kinetic helicity parameter @xmath68 .",
    "the resulting growth rates @xmath88 of the bound ( localized ) eigenmodes and @xmath51 of the fastest growing unbound ( nonlocalized ) eigenmode are shown on the logarithmic - scale plots in figure  [ figure_1 ] .",

    "the logarithmic - scale plots of the absolute values of electric current helicity spectral eigenfunctions are given in figure  [ figure_3 ] .",
    "in the case @xmath91 and @xmath85 there exist @xmath92 growing bound eigenmodes of magnetic field , whose growth rates are shown on the plot  ( a ) in figure  [ figure_1 ] . among these",

    "the spectral eigenfunctions of the fastest unbound eigenmode @xmath97 are shown by the red jagged spiky lines on these left - upper plots . in the case @xmath91 and @xmath86 there are just four bound magnetic field eigenmodes , which are shown on the plot  ( b ) in figure  [ figure_1 ] .",
    "these eigenmodes are @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , and their energy and helicity spectral eigenfunctions are shown by the dotted , dash - dotted , dashed , and smooth solid lines on the right - upper plots in figures  [ figure_2 ] and  [ figure_3 ] .",
    "the fastest growing unbound eigenmode grows at a rate @xmath102 , and its spectral eigenfunctions are shown by the red jagged spiky lines .",
    "next , in the case @xmath103 and @xmath85 there are eighteen bound magnetic eigenmodes in total , all are shown on the plot  ( c ) in figure  [ figure_1 ] .",
    "the spectral eigenfunctions of four selected bound eigenmodes @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 are shown by the dotted , dash - dotted , dashed , and smooth solid lines on the left - lower plots in figures  [ figure_2 ] and  [ figure_3 ] .",
    "the spectra of the fastest growing unbound mode @xmath108 are again shown by the red jagged spiky lines . finally , in the case @xmath103 and @xmath86 there are four bound eigenmodes , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , refer to the plot  ( d ) in figure  [ figure_1 ] .",

    "their growth rates , @xmath88 , become strongly concentrated near the growth rate of the fastest unbound eigenmode , @xmath51 .",
    "( this last result follows from a nearly uniform distribution of @xmath88 on the logarithmic - scale plots  ( a ) and  ( c ) in figure  [ figure_1 ] . )",
    "second , on all plots in figure  [ figure_1 ] the growth rate of the first bound eigenmode , @xmath114 , happens to be very close to @xmath51 .",
    "we found same result for all other high reynolds number cases that we investigated ( not reported here ) , with different admissible values of the helicity parameter @xmath68 .",
    "thus , we propose that for dynamo driven by high reynolds number kolmogorov - type velocity field there always exists a shallow bound eigenmode @xmath114 , such that @xmath115 .",
    "this shallow mode grows faster than any of the unbound modes because @xmath116 .",
    "third , the spectra of the shallow bound eigenmode @xmath114 , shown by the dotted lines in figures  [ figure_2 ] and  [ figure_3 ] , and the spectra of the fastest growing unbound eigenmode @xmath51 , shown by the red jagged spiky lines , are close near the magnetic energy containing large scales .",
    "( small - scale structures of these modes are however different : the shallow eigenmode has a relatively larger small - scales component . ) in practical applications , the shallow mode grows faster than the unbound modes and can dominate at large scales ; however it can not be described by the conventional @xmath18-model for large - scale dynamo , since this model does not capture the bound modes .",
    "fourth , consider the spectra of eigenmodes @xmath51 and @xmath114 ( the dotted lines and the red jagged spiky solid lines in figures  [ figure_2 ] and  [ figure_3 ] ) . when the value of the kinetic helicity drops by a factor of @xmath92 ( from @xmath85 to @xmath86 ) , the location of the peaks of these spectra shifts to larger scales by the same factor .",
    "thus , the characteristic scales of eigenmodes @xmath51 and @xmath114 are both approximately equal to @xmath117 , so that both these modes peak at large scale when kinetic helicity is small .  , the eigenfunction of the fastest growing unbound eigenmode , @xmath118\\sim h^2v_0/l_0 $ ] , asymptotically becomes a mixture of cosine and sine standing waves with wavenumber @xmath119 , while the bound eigenfunctions decline as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "] this result is consistent with general predictions of the @xmath18-model  @xcite .",
    "we have presented the full numerical characterization of the kinematic kazantsev - kraichnan dynamo model in the case of the kolmogorov scaling of the velocity field .",
    "our main conclusion is that the structure and the characteristic correlation scales of the magnetic field amplified by helical kinematic dynamo action are determined by both bound ( localized ) and unbound ( nonlocalized ) growing eigenmodes . in particular ,",
    "the large - scale component of the field is defined by the unbound eigenmodes and by the shallow bound eigenmodes .",
    "because these shallow bound eigenmodes have growth rates higher than those of all unbound eigenmodes , at any given scale the former may rapidly become dominant over the latter .",
    "in practical applications , this means that the shallow bound modes , rather than the unbound modes , are likely to become essential in the large - scale magnetic field configurations in astrophysical systems . in this case",
    "the conventional @xmath18-dynamo model  @xcite gives an inadequate description of the large - scale magnetic field even at the kinematic stage of dynamo action .",
    "the @xmath18-model becomes inapplicable in this case because it uses a critical assumption that small - scale fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic fields are much weaker and concentrated at the scales much smaller than the scales of the growing large - scale field . under this assumption the @xmath18-model",
    "is obtained by averaging the induction equation  ( [ induction ] ) over these small - scale fluctuations to obtain a linear and homogeneous differential equation for the large - scale mean magnetic field .-",
    "model equation for the mean field @xmath122 is @xmath123 .",
    "this is a linear and homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath3 is a characteristic velocity , @xmath2 is a characteristic scale , and @xmath126 is a characteristic decorrelation time of fluid fluctuations .",
    "] thus , the @xmath18-model misses all growing bound magnetic eigenmodes , including the essential shallow bound eigenmodes that determine the eventual large - scale configuration of the magnetic field .",
