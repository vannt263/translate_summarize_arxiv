    "the many body problem as applied to finite systems has a long history in atomic and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "one of the central problems has been the nature of the ground state in case of a partially filled shell .",
    "when we consider atoms ( a gas at zero temperature ) in an external potential the possible behaviors are quite rich .",
    "one can assume that the collision between atoms does not excite internal degrees of freedom and the atoms can be regarded as structureless objects whose spins are fixed being in a definite hyperfine state .",
    "the external potential can be supplied by a magnetic or optical trap @xcite . in the past few years",
    "a very intensive research has been continued in case of bose - particles both theoretically and experimentally in a variety of such systems .",
    "fermion systems along these lines have been less studied until recently , but important achievements have been already available and one can be sure that rapid development will continue in the future .",
    "in particular the achievement and study of the superfluid state has become one of the frontiers in physics ( see for reviews @xcite , which contain references to earlier works ) .    in this paper",
    "we treat fermionic systems .",
    "the external potential will be assumed to be spherically symmetric and the interaction between atoms will be described by a spin independent @xmath7 function like attractive pseudopotential . within the single @xmath0-shell model of fermionic atoms with arbitrary large spins we study the ground state properties of the gas .",
    "we concentrate on cluster states containing particles of numbers @xmath8 where @xmath1 is the spin of the particles and @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of such clusters have been pointed out by us previously @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend the investigations in several directions .",
    "it is advantageous to use the second quantized representation , which makes possible , among other things , to obtain the multi - cluster states by repeated applications of of the cluster creation operator to the vacuum . besides numerical calculations extensive analytical studies are carried out .",
    "it is shown that to a good approximation the hamilton operator can be replaced by a model one built of the the operator of the particle number , of the quadratic casimir operators of the groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "it is shown that within the model the clusters can be conceived as interacting ( cooper ) pairs if @xmath11 , the interaction being of statistical origin .",
    "the model hamiltonian coincides with the true one for @xmath12 ( the special cases mainly investigated in @xcite ) .    for the model",
    "hamiltonian the cluster states are explicitly given and it is pointed out that the energy of the @xmath5-cluster state can be written as the sum of energies of the clusters proportional to @xmath5 and an `` interaction term '' term between the clusters proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "it is found that the second term disappears when @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath14 it was shown by racah in 1952 @xcite that the ground state consists of independent pairs .",
    "investigations of particles in an open shell has been an important area in atom and nuclear physics . as discussed above in the trapped gas of fermi atoms new features",
    "appear due to the fact that the spin of the particles can be higher than @xmath15 . comparing with the situation in the atom shell a further important difference",
    "is that instead of the long ranged coulomb force between the electrons the atom - atom interaction which has to be considered is short ranged , while comparing the situation with that of an open neutron shell in a nucleus an important difference is that in our case the open shell is an @xmath0-one ( since no - spin orbit interaction is present ) as contrasted to the @xmath16-one in the nucleus .    though our main purpose in this paper is to enlarge the picture we have about the dynamics of fermionic particles in a partly filled shell , a few words about the relevance of the model for physically realizable situations in case of trapped gases are in order .",
    "obviously optical traps are the suitable ones which allow the free rotation of the spins .",
    "it is assumed that the external potential contains besides the confining potential ( which is typically of a harmonic oscillator type ) the mean field of the atoms building the closed shells .",
    "there are two conditions then to be fulfilled in order that the single-@xmath0 shell model apply .",
    "firstly , the mean field due to the closed shells should be strong enough that the possible degeneracy of the levels of different @xmath0 values be lifted considerable .",
    "secondly , the characteristic interaction energy of the atoms in the partly occupied shell should be smaller than the relevant level distance in the external potential .",
    "both requirements can be satisfied simultaneously if the strength of the interaction between the atoms is weak and the number of the atoms in the trapped gas is sufficiently large @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] the hamiltonian is written in terms of irreducible tensor operators and a model hamiltonian is introduced built from the operator of particle number and from the quadratic casimir operators of the groups @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the section [ sec : clust_states ] is devoted to the extensive investigation of the one - cluster state .",
    "the symmetrizer playing an important role in creating the cluster states is analyzed in detail in section [ sec : symmetrizer ] .",
    "energy eigenvalues of the model hamiltonian for cluster states generated by the cluster creation operator are calculated in section [ sec : h_mvec ] .",
    "it is shown in section [ sec : aver_ener ] that the expectation value of the hamiltonian agrees with that of the model one for cluster states .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] contains the summary and a discussion of the results .",
    "appendices [ app : ops ] and [ app : decomp ] present certain steps of proofs outlined in the main text .",
    "appendix [ app : spinonehalf ] discusses the special case when the spin of the particles is @xmath15 .",
