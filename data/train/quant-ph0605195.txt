    "the concept of a quantum random walk ( qrw ) has been widely discussed and extended in various directions @xcite since its introduction aharonov , meyer , ambainis4 and developement kempe1,fahri2,ambainis3,konno2,travaglione , sanders , dur , nielsenchuang .",
    "much of the interest has derived from an expectation that such a mathematically attractive idea should have important applications in quantum information theory , analogous to known applications of classical random walks ( crws ) in classical information science .",
    "on the other hand , crws also have many applications outside classical information theory , in a wide variety of areas of science where mathematical modelling is involved , so it should not be surprising if qrws find applications outside quantum information theory . here",
    "we describe such an application to relativistic quantum mechanics ; for an earlier application in this field , see @xcite .",
    "the evolution in time of the state of a free dirac particle , starting from a highly localized , positive - energy state , is a quantum process that has only recently been described fully @xcite .",
    "there had been a widespread misapprehension that no relativistic particle with nonzero rest - mass @xmath0 could be localized much within its compton wavelength @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the speed of light .",
    "however it has now been shown bracken1 that there is no such difficulty for the dirac particle if localization is characterized in terms of the dirac position operator @xmath3 , by making @xmath4 small while keeping the energy positive , and not by unrealistic attempts to restrict the domain of the wavefunction to a bounded region in configuration space .",
    "arbitrarily precise localization , with @xmath5 , is possible in the case of the free dirac particle with positive energy .",
    "when the particle is localized in such an initial state , it has an associated uncertainty in energy @xmath6 , and the subsequent evolution produces a probability density that spreads outwards in all directions at close to speed @xmath2 .",
    "the graph of the evolving density along any axis through the centre of initial localization ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) shows a striking resemblance to the two - horned density found for a typical 1-dimensional qrw @xcite . for the dirac particle ,",
    "the horns are close to distance @xmath7 from the starting point .",
    "we shall show that this is not a coincidence , and that the evolution of _ any _ positive - energy state of a free dirac particle moving in 1-dimension can be modelled arbitrarily closely as a qrw of the type described in detail by ambainis _",
    "@xcite , konno @xcite and others .",
    "in addition to providing a somewhat surprising application of a qrw to a real process , this result provides some new insights as to the nature of the quantum walk itself . until now",
    "the various proposed realization schemes for qrws were typically based on the idea that the coin and walker degrees of freedom of the walk should be associated with two distinct quantum systems .",
    "these two systems were to be combined by means of some form of dynamical coupling - decoupling scheme .",
    "the present application shows that alternatively , a single quantum mechanical object such as the free dirac particle  by its very nature as a relativistic system with translational and spin degrees of freedom  can be identified in the course of its time evolution with a quantum random walk .",
    "this natural occurence of a qrw , instead of some engineered realization , suggests that the question of its ontological status is still an interesting and open one .",
    "the present application draws attention to two other important features of qrws that have been emphasized by others @xcite .",
    "the first is that a qrw is a unitary evolution ; the associated randomness is of the kind associated with every unitary quantum evolution .",
    "in particular , a qrw is typically reversible in time , unlike a crw .",
    "the second feature is that a qrw is typically a ballistic process , associated with spreading at a constant speed , unlike diffusive crws , where spreading is proportional to the square root of the time .",
    "these two features are essential for the application that we describe below to the free dirac evolution , which is a time - reversible process characterized by spreading near the speed of light .    in what follows",
    ", we relate the evolution of dirac s equation to that of a qrw based on the canonical heisenberg algebra extended by the dirac matrices",
    ". then we construct and discuss the limiting probability distribution describing the translational spreading of an initial state .",
    "the paper concludes with some speculations about the physical reality of the quantum walk of the dirac particle , and the possibility of detecting it experimentally .",
    "the free dirac hamiltonian operator for a particle with zero momentum along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions is    @xmath10    acting on 4-component spinor wavefunctions @xmath11 . here",
    "we adopt a representation of the dirac matrices with    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the usual pauli matrices , and @xmath15 is the @xmath16 unit matrix . in this representation",
    "the helicity ( spin ) operator associated with rotations about the @xmath17-axis is @xmath18 . from this point",
    "onwards we adopt the natural units @xmath19 . recalling that only those solutions of dirac s equation with positive energy describe physical electron states , we introduce the orthonormal positive - energy spinors in momentum space    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these spinors satisfy the relations    @xmath24    now we can write an arbitrary positive - energy wavefunction ( with zero @xmath8 and @xmath9 components of momentum ) @xmath25 in terms of two arbitrary functions @xmath26 as    @xmath27    then @xmath28 and finite mean energy . then    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    with @xmath31 , the action of @xmath32 in the second factor of the tensor product space in ( [ dirac_matrices ] ) and ( [ energy_spinors ] ) becomes trivial , as the second spinor remains constant at the value @xmath33 .",
    "thus the second factor space can be ignored , and we can consider @xmath34 to have the _ effective _ form    @xmath35    acting in the first factor space . in this first space , we write @xmath36so that the positive - energy spinor @xmath37 in ( [ energy_spinors ] ) takes the ( effective ) form    @xmath38    next we consider a fixed , small time interval @xmath39 the ( effective ) unitary evolution operator for the dirac particle can then be approximated over the time interval @xmath40 using the relations    @xmath41^{2})\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xmath54    and we can emulate the dirac evolution by the evolution of a qrw . if we are interested in particular in the evolution of the probability density along the @xmath17-axis for the electron , we need only go at each time @xmath49 to the asymptotic form of the qrw probability distribution for the  walker \" ambainis4,konno1,konno3 .    it is important to note at this point that whereas the exact dirac evolution operator @xmath55 obviously preserves the positive energy condition for physically meaningful states , the same is not true of the approximate , qrw evolution @xmath50 .",
    "however , ( [ approx_evolution2 ] ) and ( [ evolution3 ] ) show that in the asymptotic limit described , the positive energy condition is respected .",
    "we close this section with the following remark . rewriting the evolution operators as @xmath56 , @xmath57",
    ", we identify the type of quantum walk involved here as a canonical algebra qrw ( ca - qrw ) in the classification of @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the euclidean qrw , which takes place on the integers and whose evolution operator is constructed from the generators of the euclidean algebra ellinas , ellinas1,ellinas2,ellinas3 , in the present case the generators of the canonical heisenberg algebra  position and momentum operators  are used in the construction of a discrete walk on the @xmath17-coordinate axis . the close algebraic relationship between these two walks",
    "facilitates the solution of the time evolution in the present case , provided ( as is done in next section ) that we carefully discretize the coordinate - space ( generalized ) eigenfunctions , which unlike their euclidean qrw counterparts , are not orthogonal .",
    "let @xmath58 denote the hilbert space spanned by all vectors @xmath59 . introduce a dense subspace @xmath60 consisting of all finite linear combinations of suitably regular vectors @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is an arbitrary polynomial and @xmath63",
    "is some fixed positive constant .",
    "then denote by @xmath64 the space dual to @xmath65 and , with the usual abuse of notation , consider @xmath58 as a subspace of @xmath64 , so that we obtain the gelfand triple ( or rigged hilbert space @xcite ) @xmath66 the space @xmath64 contains in particular the vectors @xmath67 is the generalized eigenvector of the dirac @xmath17-coordinate operator @xmath68 , @xmath69 corresponding in the coordinate representation to @xmath70 .",
    "the introduction of the time interval @xmath40 as in ( approx_evolution1 ) , in turn defines a length interval @xmath40 on the @xmath17-axis ( recall that @xmath71 now ) , and a corresponding direct - integral decomposition @xmath72 where @xmath73 is spanned by all vectors of the form @xmath74 , with @xmath75 $ ] fixed , and @xmath76 .",
    "we note at once that each @xmath77 is invariant under the action of the qrw evolution operator @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath78 because @xmath79    in order to describe the qrw evolution more fully , we now write the initial state with wave function as in ( [ psi_initial ] ) and ( [ f_choice ] ) , as an entangled state of the walker and coin subsystems ,    @xmath80    where @xmath81normalization of @xmath82 is satisfied because    @xmath83    as a consequence of ( [ spinor_normalization ] ) and ( [ normalization ] ) . at this point",
    "we emphasize again that although , as is well known wigner , @xmath84 is _ not _ a positive - energy ( generalized ) state , @xmath85 _ is _ a positive - energy state , as a consequence of the particular form of the coefficients in ( [ coefficients ] ) .",
    "the expansion in ( [ initial_state ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath86which is to be compared with ( [ sdecompose ] ) . in view of the invariance of each @xmath87 under the action of the qrw evolution",
    ", we can restrict our attention to that action on each substate@xmath88with @xmath89 fixed , even though these substates are not normalizable , and are not positive - energy states .",
    "the point is that the general form of any such substate is preserved under the action of the qrw evolution @xmath42 , with no change in the value of @xmath89 .",
    "the inclusion of the multiplicative factor @xmath90 in last equation is for later convenience with the normalization .",
    "consider firstly the action of @xmath43 on a general substate @xmath91 say one with @xmath92 for definiteness .",
