    "the study of magnetic models has generated considerable progresses in the understanding of magnetic materials , and lately , it has overcome the frontiers of magnetism , being considered in many areas of knowledge .",
    "certainly , the ising model represents one of the most studied and important models of magnetism and statistical mechanics  @xcite , and it has been employed also to typify a wide variety of physical systems , like lattice gases , binary alloys , and proteins ( with a particular interest in the problem of protein folding ) .",
    "although real magnetic systems should be properly described by means of heisenberg spins ( i.e. , three - dimensional variables ) , many materials are characterized by anisotropy fields that make these spins prefer given directions in space , explaining why simple models , characterized by binary variables , became so important for the area of magnetism .",
    "particularly , models defined in terms of ising variables have shown the ability for exhibiting a wide variety of multicritical behavior by introducing randomness , and/or competing interactions , has attracted the attention of many researchers  ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "certainly , the simplicity of ising variables , which are very suitable for both analytical and numerical studies , has led to proposals of important models outside the scope of magnetism , particularly in the area of complex systems .",
    "these models have been successful for describing a wide variety of relevant features in such systems , and have raised interest in many fields , like financial markets , optimization problems , biological membranes , and social behavior . in some cases ,",
    "more than one ising variable have been used , especially by considering a coupling between them , as proposed within the framework of choice theories  @xcite , or in plastic crystals  @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "each set of ising variables represents a group of identical individuals , all of which can make two independent binary choices .",
    "the so - called plastic crystals  @xcite appear as states of some compounds considered to be simpler than those of canonical glasses , but still presenting rather nontrivial relaxation and equilibrium properties .",
    "such a plastic phase corresponds to an intermediate stable state , between a high - temperature ( disordered ) liquid phase , and a low - temperature ( ordered ) solid phase and both transitions , namely , liquid - plastic and plastic - solid , are first order . in this intermediate phase , the rotational disorder coexists with a translationally ordered state , characterized by the centers of mass of the molecules forming a regular crystalline lattice with the molecules presenting disorder in their orientational degrees of freedom , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fasesdecristais ] .",
    "many materials undergo a liquid - plastic phase transition , where the lower - temperature phase presents such a partial orientational order , like the plastic - crystal of fig .",
    "[ fig : fasesdecristais ] .",
    "the property of translational invariance makes the plastic crystals much simpler to be studied from both analytical and numerical methods , becoming very useful towards a proper understanding of the glass transition  @xcite . in some plastic - crystal models",
    "one introduces a coupling between two ising models , associating each of these systems respectively , to the translational and rotational degrees of freedom  @xcite , as a proposal for explaining satisfactorily thermodynamic properties of the plastic phase .",
    "accordingly , spin variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are introduced in such a way to mimic translational and rotational degrees of freedom of each molecule @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the following hamiltonian is considered  @xcite ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 represents a sum over distinct pairs of nearest - neighbor spins . in the first summation ,",
    "the ising variables @xmath5 may characterize two lattices a and b ( or occupied and vacant sites ) .",
    "one notices that the rotational variables @xmath6 could be , in principle , continuous variables , although the fact that the minimization of the coupling contribution @xmath7 is achieved for @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , or for @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , suggests the simpler choice of binary variables ( @xmath12 ) to be appropriate , based on the energy minimization requirement .    in the present model the variables @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath6 represent very different characteristics of a molecule .",
    "particularly , the rotational variables @xmath6 are expected to change more freely than the translational ones ; for this reason , one introduces a random field acting only on the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , the whole contribution @xmath14 is known to play a fundamental role for the plastic phase of ionic plastic crystals , like the alkalicyanides kcn , nacn and rbcn . in spite of its simplicity , the above hamiltonian",
    "is able to capture the most relevant features of the plastic - crystal phase , as well as the associated phase transitions , namely , liquid - plastic and plastic - solid ones  @xcite .",
    "a system described by a hamiltonian slightly different from the one of  eq .  ( [ eq : hamplastcrystals ] ) , in which the whole contribution @xmath14 was replaced by @xmath15 , i.e. , with no random field acting on variable @xmath6 separately , was considered in ref .  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : hamplastcrystals ] ) have not considered thoroughly the effects of the random field @xmath16 , with a particular attention to the phase diagrams for the case of a randomly distributed bimodal one , @xmath17 ; this represents the main motivation of the present work . in the next section",
    "we define the model , determine its free - energy density , and describe the numerical procedure to be used .",
    "in section iii we exhibit typical phase diagrams and analyze the behavior of the corresponding order parameters , for both zero and finite temperatures ; the ability of the model to exhibit a rich variety of phase diagrams , characterized by multicritical behavior , is shown .",
    "finally , in section iv we present our main conclusions .",
    "based on the discussion of the previous section , herein we consider a system composed by two interacting ising models , described by the hamiltonian    @xmath18    where @xmath19 represent sums over all distinct pairs of spins , a limit for which the mean - field approximation becomes exact .",

    "the phase diagrams referred as topologies i and ii exhibit all three phases . in the later case we have found a first - order critical line terminating at an ordered critical point , leading to the potential physical realization of going continuously from the ordered phase to the partially - ordered phase by circumventing this critical point .",

    ", topology iii [ @xmath169 corresponds to the richest type of phase diagram , being characterized by several critical lines and multicritical points ; one finds its most complex criticality around @xmath150 , signaling a great competition among the different types of orderings .",
    "although the partially - ordered phase does not appear in this particular case , one has also the possibility of circumventing the ordered critical point , such as to reach a region of the phase diagram along which @xmath115 becomes very small , resembling a partially - ordered phase .    since the infinite - range interactions among variables of each ising system correspond to a limit where mean - field approach becomes exact , an immediate question concerns whether some of the results obtained above represent an artifact of such limit .",
    "certainly , such a relevant point is directly related with the existence of some of these features in the associated short - range three - dimensional magnetic models .",
    "for example , the tricritical point found in topologies iii and iv is essentially the same that appears within the mean - field approach of the ising model in the presence of a bimodal random field .",
    "this later model has been extensively investigated on a cubic lattice through different numerical approaches , where the existence of this tricritical point is still very controversial . on the other hand ,",
    "a first - order critical frontier terminating at an ordered critical point , and the fact that one can go from one phase to another by circumventing this point , represents a typical physical situation that occurs in real substances .",

    "finally , we emphasize that the rich critical behavior presented in the phase diagrams corresponding to topologies ii and iii suggest the range @xmath173 as appropriate for describing plastic crystals .",
    "the potential of exhibiting successive transitions from the ordered to the partially - ordered and then to the disordered phase should be useful for a better understanding of these systems .",
