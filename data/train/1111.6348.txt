    "one is often interested in the behavior of the polynomials @xmath20 in various regions of the plane .",
    "the most general results concern the behavior of @xmath20 in @xmath21 , where one is often able to employ potential theoretic techniques ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "our main goal will be to show that the behavior of the polynomial @xmath22 when @xmath23 is sufficiently large is determined only by its leading coefficient and the fact that it has @xmath3-norm equal to @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , in theorem [ nis ] below , we will show that any other polynomial of the same degree having approximately the same leading coefficient and approximately the same @xmath3-norm has the same behavior when @xmath23 is sufficiently large .",
    "the primary tool will be a non - linear characterization of the polynomials @xmath24 originally proven by saff in @xcite , whose proof proceeds as follows .",
    "the orthogonality relation implies that if @xmath25 then @xmath26 this of course immediately shows that for @xmath27 one has @xmath28 setting @xmath29 and dividing shows that for any polynomial @xmath30 of degree at most @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 whenever both denominators in ( [ king ] ) are non - zero .    at first glance ,",
    "the utility of ( [ king ] ) is not obvious , though some applications are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will apply this formula in cases where @xmath33 is also @xmath31-dependent .",
    "the key to our calculations will be to write the numerator on the right hand side of ( [ king ] ) as a perturbation of the denominator and - under suitable hypotheses - show that the perturbation tends to zero as @xmath34 while the denominator does not . in order to do so",

    ". we will apply it to prove several results , including a simplification of the conjecture in @xcite and some stability results for @xmath22 under perturbations of the measure @xmath1 .",
    "our most important results concern the ratio asymptotics of the orthonormal polynomials when the measure @xmath1 is _ regular _ ( see below ) on the closed unit disk or a lemniscate .",
    "one usually studies the asymptotics of @xmath22 outside of @xmath13 in one of three ways ; the first is _ root asymptotics _ : @xmath38 the second is _ ratio asymptotics _ : @xmath39 and the third is _ szeg asymptotics _ : @xmath40 it is easy to see that the existence of the limit for szeg asymptotics implies the existence of the limit for ratio asymptotics , which in turn implies the existence of the limit for root asymptotics , and in general none of the converse statements hold .",
    "a measure @xmath1 is called _ regular _ if @xmath41 ( see @xcite for an elementary discussion of capacity ) .",
    "if @xmath42 is a compact set then a measure @xmath1 is said to be _",
    "regular on @xmath42 _ if @xmath1 is regular , @xmath43 , and the boundary of @xmath44 is contained in @xmath12 .",
    "regularity is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of root asymptotics ( see theorem 3.1.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "although ratio asymptotics need not hold for regular measures ( see the example in section [ diskrat ] ) , we can say something about the asymptotic behavior of @xmath45 .",
    "we prove that if the measure @xmath1 is regular on @xmath46 , then the ratio @xmath47 converges to @xmath0 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath48 as @xmath31 tends to infinity through a subsequence of asymptotic density @xmath0 . using the methods of @xcite",
    ", one can show a similar result holds for compactly supported measures on @xmath49 with essential support equal to @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "we also show that if the measure @xmath1 is regular on the lemniscate @xmath51 then the ratio @xmath52 converges to @xmath0 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath53 as @xmath31 tends to infinity through a subsequence of asymptotic density @xmath0 .",
    "the advantage of working on a lemniscate is that there is a monic polynomial whose @xmath54-norm is @xmath0 on the lemniscate , while for more general supports this is not necessarily the case .",
    "if this is not the case , then we can not obtain convergence of @xmath55 by our methods , but we can describe the behavior of @xmath56 for a possibly unbounded sequence @xmath57 ( see section [ conn ] for details ) .    the strength of our results is rooted in the weak assumptions we place on the measure @xmath1 in order to arrive at a ratio asymptotic result .",
    "many ratio asymptotic results arise as a consequence of szeg asymptotics ( see @xcite ) , which is a stronger conclusion than ratio asymptotics and hence requires stronger hypotheses on the measure . in @xcite ,",
    "saff places bounds on @xmath58 for arbitrary compactly supported measures using methods similar to ours .",
    "the results in @xcite concern orthogonal polynomials on the real line and are in the same spirit as our theorem [ nis ] , though theorem [ nis ] is much more general .",
    "in addition to studying ratio asymptotics for consecutive orthonormal polynomials , we will also consider ratios of orthonormal polynomials corresponding to different but related measures .",
    "in particular , we will study the _ uvarov transform _",
    ", which is obtained by adding a point mass to the measure @xmath1 : @xmath59 and the _ christoffel transform _ , which is obtained by multiplying @xmath1 by the square modulus of a monomial : @xmath60 in both cases ,",
    "we show that the asymptotic behavior of the orthonormal polynomials outside of @xmath13 is unchanged provided the pure point ( for the uvarov transform ) or the zero of the monomial ( for the christoffel transform ) satisfies the condition @xmath61 ( see ( [ nevailike ] ) in section [ stabl ] ) .",
    "the condition of regularity is equivalent to @xmath62 for every @xmath63 in the outer boundary of the support of @xmath1 , except perhaps on a set of capacity @xmath64 ( see theorem 3.1.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , condition ( [ nevlike ] ) - when applied to a point @xmath65 in the outer boundary of @xmath12 - qualitatively tells us that @xmath65 is not a point at which @xmath66 grows exponentially ( see also theorem 1.3 in @xcite ) .    after proving the key fact about ratios of polynomials in the next section",
    ", we will apply it in the case when the orthonormal polynomials correspond to a measure supported on the closed unit disk in section [ dsk ] .",
    "we also include a brief digression where we show that if @xmath1 is any regular measure on @xmath67 then there is a subsequence @xmath68 of asymptotic density @xmath0 so that the probability measures @xmath69 converge weakly to normalized arc - length measure on the unit circle as @xmath34 through @xmath70 . in section [ conn ] , we will apply the results of section [ key ] to orthonormal polynomials whose measure of orthogonality has a more general support .",
    "the main theorem in section [ conn ] is analogous to results in section [ dsk ] , but requires a small sacrifice in the strength of the conclusion due to the added generality .",
    "finally , in section [ stabl ] , we will apply the results of section [ key ] to prove our stability results concerning orthonormal polynomials when the measure is perturbed in specific ways .",

    "in this section , we will prove the crucial property mentioned in the introduction , which we will apply in later sections .",
    "before we prove our main result of this section , we make the following simple calculation :    [ below ] let @xmath1 be a measure with compact support @xmath71 and suppose @xmath63 satisfies @xmath72 .",

    ", we can find a @xmath78 so that @xmath79=\\textrm{dist}(z,{\\textrm{ch}}(\\mu))$ ] .",
    "therefore @xmath80&= \\int_{{\\mathbb{c}}}\\frac{|p_n(w;\\mu)|^2}{|z - w|^2}{\\textrm{re}}[e^{-i\\theta}\\bar{z}-e^{-i\\theta}\\overline{w}]d\\mu(w)\\\\ & \\geq \\frac{\\textrm{dist}(z,{\\textrm{ch}}(\\mu))}{\\sup_{w\\in{\\textrm{supp}}(\\mu)}|z - w|^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as desired .",
    "the uniformity in @xmath76 is now obvious .",
    "lemma [ below ] assures us that the integral on the left hand side of ( [ interim ] ) is non - zero when @xmath72 , for if it were zero then the right hand side of ( [ interim ] ) would also vanish for _ every _ choice of @xmath30 and we have just shown that it can not vanish for @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the division step in the derivation of ( [ king ] ) is justified whenever @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that the denominator on the right hand side in ( [ king ] ) is non - zero for appropriate @xmath63 .",
    "the following theorem will be used heavily for the applications in the remainder of this paper .",

    "indeed , proposition 2.3 in @xcite tells us that if @xmath1 is a regular measure , then for any function @xmath203 that is analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath14 we have @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the equilibrium measure for the support of @xmath1 ( assuming @xmath206 ; see theorem 3.6.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , if @xmath207 then we can find a subsequence @xmath208 of positive density such that @xmath209 we conclude that if @xmath1 is regular , @xmath206 , the hypotheses of theorem [ nis ] are satisfied , @xmath210 , and ( [ eqzer ] ) holds , then the conclusion ( [ keyconc ] ) holds as @xmath31 tends to infinity through @xmath211 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we will show later by means of an example that one can not in general extend theorem [ nis ] to include the boundary of @xmath14 ( see section [ chr ] below ) .",
    "if a measure @xmath1 is supported on an arbitrary region @xmath212 , we can not prove a result quite as precise as theorem [ realc ] or corollary [ reg ] using our methods .",
    "the main difficulty is that the conformal maps sending the exterior of @xmath67 to the exterior of @xmath67 or the complement of @xmath50 $ ] have finite laurent expansions , which simplifies matters computationally . to make up for this",
    ", we will approximate the exterior conformal map with polynomials .",
    "the price we will pay is that we will reach a conclusion about @xmath56 for a possibly unbounded sequence @xmath57 ( but see the example below ) .",
    "our proof in this setting will require use of a specific sequence of polynomials called the _ faber polynomials _",
    "( see @xcite ) , which we will denote by @xmath213 .",
    "given a bounded region @xmath214 , let @xmath17 be the unbounded component of @xmath215 , which is simply connected in the extended complex plane .",
    "let @xmath216 denote the conformal map sending @xmath17 to @xmath136 satisfying @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "there are three conditions given in @xcite that guarantee the uniform convergence of @xmath219 to @xmath64 on @xmath220 as @xmath34 .",
    "whenever this convergence property holds ( for example if @xmath212 satisfies any of the three conditions in @xcite ) , we will say @xmath212 is of class @xmath221 and write @xmath222 . also note that",
    "if @xmath212 has logarithmic capacity @xmath0 then @xmath223 is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath31 for every @xmath75 .",
    "our result is the following :    [ keps ] let @xmath1 be a measure on the closure of a bounded region @xmath222 with logarithmic capacity @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath224 be infinite subsequences so that for each @xmath225 , @xmath226 as @xmath34 through @xmath70 .",
    "then there exists a non - decreasing and unbounded sequence @xmath227 of elements of @xmath122 such that @xmath228 for all @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , the convergence is uniform on compact subsets of @xmath53",
    ".    we will apply theorem [ nis ] with @xmath229 for some appropriate @xmath230 .",
    "first note that our hypotheses imply that if the sequence @xmath231 grows slowly enough then @xmath232 tends to @xmath0 as @xmath34 through @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the second condition of theorem [ nis ] is satisfied by @xmath84 .",
    "remark 2 following theorem [ nis ] puts a lower bound on the @xmath233 of the @xmath234-norm of @xmath84 . to put an upper bound on the @xmath91 ,",
    "we see @xmath235 for every @xmath75 .",
    "therefore @xmath236 where @xmath237 tends to @xmath64 as @xmath34 through @xmath70 provided @xmath227 is unbounded ( this is because @xmath222 and @xmath238 for all @xmath239 ) . by invoking theorem [ nis ] , we conclude that @xmath240 for all @xmath72 and the convergence is uniform on compact subsets of @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath219 tends to @xmath64 on @xmath220 as @xmath34 , ( [ fbound ] ) implies ( [ gcase ] ) .",
    "although theorem [ keps ] is an analog of theorem [ saffback ] for more general supports , proving an analog of corollary [ reg ] or theorem [ realc ] is more challenging .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that it is possible to have @xmath241 when the support of the measure is not the closed unit disk .",
    "the following example shows that we can strengthen the conclusion of theorem [ keps ] to more closely resemble that of theorem [ realc ] if some power of the conformal map @xmath216 is a monic polynomial .",
    "* example . *",
    "consider the set @xmath242 ( pictured below for @xmath243 ) .",
    "[ gdrop ]    . ]    in this case , @xmath244 ( see example 3.8 in @xcite ) so that if @xmath1 is a measure supported on @xmath245 , we can write @xmath246 for all @xmath75 . if @xmath1 is regular , then we have @xmath247 we can now apply the same reasoning as in the proof of corollary [ reg ] to conclude that there is a subsequence @xmath68 of asymptotic density @xmath0 so that @xmath248 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath249 so the proof of theorem [ keps ] shows that in fact we have @xmath250 for all @xmath72 .",
    "notice that if we set @xmath251 we recover corollary [ reg ] .",
    "the same calculation applies in any situation where some power of the conformal map @xmath216 is a monic polynomial .",
    "another application of theorem [ nis ] is to show that the behavior of the polynomials @xmath24 is stable under certain perturbations of the measure . in the following example",
    ", we consider the _ uvarov transform _ of a measure ( see @xcite ) , meaning we add a single point mass to the measure @xmath1 .",
    "* example .",
    "* let @xmath1 be a measure with compact support and @xmath252 .",
    "we will show that for any @xmath253 we have @xmath254 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath53 if and only if @xmath255 where @xmath256 .",
    "we will apply theorem [ nis ] with @xmath257 .",
    "the proof of theorem 10.13.3 in @xcite applies in this setting also to show that @xmath258 notice that , @xmath259 always exists and lies in the interval @xmath260 $ ] .",
    "therefore , if we assume ( [ nevailike ] ) holds then ( [ normrat ] ) verifies the second condition in theorem [ nis ] for @xmath84 . to verify the first condition ,",
    "write @xmath261 and notice @xmath262 dividing through by @xmath263 and using our above calculations , we get @xmath264 as @xmath34 , which verifies the first condition in theorem [ nis ] and hence proves ( [ exone ] ) .",
    "in fact , the calculations in the above example prove our next result .",
    "it shows that if a measure is perturbed in a way that does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the monic orthogonal polynomial norms , then it also does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the orthonormal polynomials outside @xmath13 .        a second kind of perturbation we will consider is the _ christoffel transform _ of a measure ( see @xcite ) , where we multiply the measure by the square modulus of a monomial ; that is , we define @xmath270 the location of the point @xmath65 will not be arbitrary ; indeed we will have to place a hypothesis on the point @xmath65 as in ( [ nevailike ] ) .",
    "we will see later ( corollary [ nogrow ] below ) that this forces @xmath65 to lie in the convex hull of the support of @xmath1 .    for every @xmath75 , we recall the notation @xmath271 to mean the reproducing kernel for polynomials of degree at most @xmath31 and the measure @xmath1 , which is given by @xmath272 a very simple calculation provides us with the following formula ( see proposition @xmath273 in @xcite ) : @xmath274      [ chrstfl ] let @xmath1 be a measure with compact support and let @xmath275 and @xmath1 be related by ( [ nudef ] ) where @xmath65 satisfies ( [ nevailike ] ) . then @xmath276 uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath53 .",
    "we wish to apply theorem [ nis ] with @xmath277 .",

    ", we calculate @xmath279 the leading coefficient @xmath85 of @xmath84 is just @xmath280",
    "so we have @xmath281 as @xmath34 by our assumption ( [ nevailike ] ) .",
    "this verifies the second condition of theorem [ nis ] and hence the desired conclusion follows .",
    "* example .",
    "* let @xmath1 be two - dimensional area measure on the unit disk @xmath284 so that @xmath285 .",
    "it is easily seen that in this case , the point @xmath0 satisfies ( [ nevailike ] ) so we will consider the christoffel transform given by @xmath286 . by the example in section iv.6 in @xcite ( or equation ( [ chrpert ] ) above ) ,",
    "we know that @xmath287 we then see that @xmath288 which clearly tends to @xmath0 as @xmath34 if @xmath289 , in accordance with theorem [ chrstfl ] .    it is clear that @xmath290 so we can not in general hope to extend theorem [ nis ] to include convergence on the boundary of @xmath14 . however , in this example all of the zeros of @xmath22 are contained in @xmath284 so @xmath291 is a function in @xmath292 and as such @xmath293 as @xmath34 , which suggests we do have convergence to @xmath0 almost everywhere on @xmath155 in this example .",
    "a short calculation reveals that this is the case .        since all zeros of @xmath139 are contained in @xmath13 , we have @xmath295 for every @xmath75 , which means ( [ nevailike ] ) can not possibly hold for otherwise , by theorem [ chrstfl ] this expression would have to converge to @xmath0 .",
