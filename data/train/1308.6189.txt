    "fels need high - current low - emittance ( @xmath0 ) beams to lase .",
    "the slice emittance @xmath1 is of special importance . but",
    "the projected emittance @xmath2 influences the gain as well , since the effective overlap between electrons and radiation field is decreased .",
    "measurements of the slice parameter are more difficult since streaking is required . if projected and slice parameters are similar the operation of any accelerator is simplified .",
    "the swissfel injector will use an s - band gun followed by 6 s - band cavities ( with a laser heater after the first two ) and 2 x - band cavities followed by a bunch compressor bc ( @xmath3  mm ) with 330  mev nominal beam energy for operation @xcite .",
    "the injector is followed by a c - band linac bringing the beam up to 2.1  gev and the second bc ( @xmath4 mm ) compressing up to 3  ka .",
    "the final c - band linac boosts the energy up to 5.8 gev and is followed by an energy collimator with variable @xmath5 ( nominally at zero ) .    with the exception of the laser heater",
    "all magnetic chicanes are symmetric and horizontal , and all of them contain a pair of quadrupole , skew quadrupole and sextupole magnets each to correct for the centroid shifts .    for longitudinal diagnostic there is a transverse deflection cavity ( tdc ) ( 50  cm up to 4.9 mv ) after the first bc as well as the bc quadrupoles and skew quadrupoles to streak the beam .",
    "a schematic overview in fig .  [ 1 ] shows the setup .",
    "since swissfel is not yet built all results concerning swissfel are obtained by simulation using elegant @xcite .",
    "the swissfel injector test facility ( sitf ) implements the injector of the future swissfel facility .",
    "it is built for testing components and beam parameters for swissfel .",
    "the sitf consists of an s - band gun , four s - band and one x - band cavities for acceleration up to 270  mev on - crest .",
    "we reduced the energy to 180  mev due to off - crest acceleration and linearisation of the longitudinal phase space .",
    "sitf has the same longitudinal diagnostic options as described for swissfel .",
    "there are no sextupoles installed at the sitf .",
    "the black elements in fig .  [ 1 ] show the sitf setup .",
    "the sitf beam line setup was used for measurements as well as simulations @xcite .",
    "we use the statistical definition of the emittance @xmath6 for simulations and for measurements gaussian fits are used to obtain the beam sizes .",
    "it has been shown that both methods are equivalent in our case ( mostly gaussian beams ) .",
    "the variable @xmath0 denotes projected and normalized emittance .          to characterize the centroid shift we introduce the multi - order complex - valued parameter @xmath7 for each transverse plane .",
    "we use @xmath8 for the transverse axis and @xmath9 for the longitudinal axis . to be independent of @xmath0 and optics functions beam coordinates are normalized with respect to their standard deviations .",
    "transverse centroid positions @xmath10 and @xmath11 along @xmath9 propagate according to the courant - snyder theory .",
    "this allows a definition of @xmath7 similar to @xmath0 , where the magnitude stays constant in non - dispersive adiabatic systems .",
    "re(@xmath7 ) represents any introduced @xmath12 kick which is translated through betatronic phase - advance into im(@xmath7 ) , the spatial displacement of slices along the bunch .",
    "arg(@xmath7 ) corresponds to the phase advance between source and observation point .",
    "the taylor expansion of @xmath7 linking spatial and momentum centroid displacements along the bunch is given by @xmath13      changing @xmath7 in a well defined manner requires a non - zero dispersion @xmath14 and a linear longitudinal phase space .",
    "both are available within the bunch compressors . to set a specific @xmath15 two quadrupoles are used to leak out a well defined @xmath14 according to @xmath16 where @xmath17 corresponds to the focal length of the quadrupole and @xmath18 to the energy spread .",
    "the @xmath19 subscript indicates the betatronic position . since a quadrupole in a dispersive section only introduces re(@xmath7 )",
    "two quadrupoles are needed , separated by a phase advance which is not a multiple of @xmath20 .",
    "the manipulation of @xmath21 is done analogously using two skew quadrupoles : @xmath22 for swissfel there are also two pairs of sextupoles available to correct @xmath23 according to @xmath24       \\label{s}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the focal strength of the sextupole and @xmath26 corresponds to the second - order dispersion .",
    "the resulting chromaticity @xmath27 is used to correct for natural chromaticity .",
    "the leaked first - order vertical dispersion is corrected for by the skew quadrupoles .",
    "to measure the transverse centroid shift in one plane the longitudinal phase space needs to be mapped onto the orthogonal transverse plane .",
    "this is achieved by two different methods .    for the simplest case we use the transverse deflection cavity tdc to map the beam longitudinal coordinate @xmath9 onto @xmath28 .",
    "this will not be possible after the second bunch compressor of swissfel since there is no tdc foreseen in that position .",
    "an alternative way is to use one of the ( skew ) quadrupole magnets in the bc to leak out dispersion @xmath14 and thus mapping energy onto the respective transverse plane . for linear longitudinal",
    "phase space dispersion - based streaking proved to be viable since it works in both transverse planes .",
    "for the sitf @xmath7 is measured using 5 equidistant betatron phase - advance steps in the range @xmath29 $ ] in the correction plane and constant phase advance in the streaking plane ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 functions in both transverse planes are kept constant at the location of the screen .",
    "ten bunches were recorded to reduce the impact of shot - to - shot fluctuations .      a schematic flow chart of the correction algorithm is given in fig .",
    "the beam parameters need to be known to measure @xmath7 and correct for the mismatch in the optical functions . for mild mismatches in energy and optics the correction algorithm still works , but correction of the mismatch and accurate measurement of the initial @xmath7 is not possible .",
    "after the initial beam setup the electron bunch is streaked by one of discussed methods ( tdc / quadrupole / skew quadrupole ) and the resulting mismatch ( not for tdc ) is then corrected .",
    "this preparatory step has to be done only once .",
    "the response matrix is then measured perturbating the quadrupoles / skew quadrupoles / sextupoles of the measurement plane recording the penalties @xmath31 , @xmath32 and chromaticity @xmath27 .",
    "for sitf no sextupoles were used and no @xmath27 was measured .",
    "quadrupoles and skew quadrupoles for swissfel are used to minimize the introduced mismatch .",
    "for sitf only quadrupoles are used since there are no skew quadrupoles installed in the high energy section .    for the sitf also a direct calculation of the needed @xmath14 and @xmath33 with subsequent application to the beam",
    "was performed successfully .",
    "this method offers the benefit of being much faster and better scalable to more knobs but has the disadvantage of being more sensitive to errors in optics / energy / orbit in the bunch compressor .",
    "the pseudo - inverse of the measured response matrix is then used for several iterations of correction .",
    "this is viable since the introduced changes are small . in case of instabilities and machine",
    "drifts remeasuring the response matrix may be needed , however . to avoid instabilities in the correction ,",
    "any changes in the magnets are limited in magnitude to not more than twice the value of the perturbation .",
    "when finished the system has to be optimized by removing the streak and rematching the optics .      to test the performance of the correction",
    "the three main operation modes of swissfel were considered .",
    "these three operation modes consist of short pulse mode ( sp ) for ultra short fel pulses , long pulse mode ( lp ) being the default mode and large bandwidth mode ( lb ) using over - compression to increase electron energy spread leading to large photon bandwidth .",
    "all modes are further described in table  [ opmode ] . to simulate the offsets in the cavities",
    "they were displaced randomly by a gaussian distribution ( @xmath34 = 500  m ) in both transverse planes .",
    ".the tree main operation modes for swissfel to benchmark the correction algorithm .",
    "@xmath35 is significantly reduced for all the cases .",
    "cf stands for compression factor .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ opmode ]    the results in table  [ opmode ] clearly show the effectiveness of the tilt correction for the swissfel configurations .",
    "the growth in projected emittance could be reduced significantly for all the modes .",
    "the biggest @xmath36 was observed for the lb mode which has the highest charge density within the second bc due to over - compression .",
    "the transverse offset of the cavities was set to larger misalignment values than nominal tolerances to stress - test the stability of the algorithm .",
    "the specific case of the lb mode is presented in fig .  [ 3 ] .",
    "is introduced to separate the distributions for better visibility . ) ]      to benchmark the correction algorithm the sitf was used with various compression factors and different offsets in the x - band cavity . due to the machine status at the time of the measurement",
    "the charge was limited to 85  pc for the wake field measurements and to 140  pc for the compression study .",
    "figure  [ 4 ] shows a significant reduction of the projected emittance independent of the source of the tilt .",
    "one specific phase - advance measurement using over - compression is shown in fig .  [ 5 ] .",
    "is introduced to separate the distributions for better visibility . ) ]",
    "our method is very robust in terms of optical , energy and positioning ( of bc magnets ) mismatch .",
    "the correction of @xmath7 is a relatively cheap method to increase fel gain compared to other approaches or extension of the undulator line .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in any fel design .",
    "the proposed correction algorithm is time consuming ( about 1020 min for both planes at the sitf ) .",
    "this effect can be mitigated by reusing the response matrix , thereby effectively reducing the time in half .",
    "the time needed can be even further decreased by creating operation tables for given settings used in a single iteration .",
    "the skew quadrupoles introduce minor coupling which could only be corrected for by solenoids near the gun at the sitf .",
    "for swissfel there are skew quadrupoles in non - dispersive sections to minimize coupling .",
    "the optical elements in the bc introduce an energy - dependent orbit jitter .",
    "monte carlo simulations have shown that with the given amplitude / phase tolerances of the rf system the resulting orbit jitter is within our specification of less than a tenth of the beam size .    the change in @xmath5 given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the bending radius of the dipoles , and @xmath39 within the bc changes the compression factor @xcite .",
    "this can be accounted for by either changing the angle of the bc or the rf settings to keep compression constant .",
    "the shape of the current profile was mostly unchanged by the applied correction .",
