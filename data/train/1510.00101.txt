    "the speed of quantum evolution determines how long it will take for a quantum state to evolve to a target state in a given process .",
    "the shortest possible time for this dynamical process , characterized by mandelstam - tamm @xcite or margolus - levitin lower bound @xcite , is typically called the quantum speed limit ( qsl ) time , and this quantity plays an important and fundamental role in the study of quantum computation @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , quantum thermodynamics thermo , thermo2 , and quantum control @xcite .",
    "recent decades have witnessed considerable research on the qsl time , both in closed systems @xcite and in more general open systems s1,s2,qslopen1,qslopen2,qslopen3,qslexp , qslopen4,k7,k1,xu1,zhang , xu2,wu , sun , jj , xu4,wei , kp .",
    "one important discovery is the fact that entanglement is able to speed up the evolution of closed quantum systems @xcite .",
    "further studies have shown that the memory effect of the environment can also induce dynamical acceleration in open quantum systems @xcite ; this phenomenon has been experimentally observed in recent studies with a cavity field as the open system and the number of atoms as the controllable environment @xcite .",
    "the above discoveries are of considerable interest and importance because they reveal that both entanglement and the memory effect may be beneficial for controlling dynamical processes .",
    "however , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , no consistent definition exists for dynamical speedup , which has been conceptualized from multiple different perspectives .",
    "for instance , in the study of the entanglement - assisted speedup of the quantum evolution of closed systems , the primary focus is on the actual evolution time @xmath2 .",
    "speedup occurs when the actual driving time @xmath2 approaches the qsl time @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 @xcite@xmath5 from another point of view , we may focus on the qsl time itself , with the actual driving time @xmath2 held fixed . in this case",
    ", @xmath6 implies that the evolution has already been proceeding along the fastest possible path and that there is no capacity for further speedup , whereas for @xmath7 the system is thought to possess greater capacity for potential speedup qslopen3,qslexp , xu1,zhang , xu2,wu , sun , xu4,wei .",
    "therefore , there is a strong need for a well - defined measure of the speed of quantum evolution that can be employed both to detect real ( not just potential ) dynamical speedup and to reexamine the mechanisms of dynamical speedup in closed and open systems .    here",
    ", we construct such a measure for detecting quantum speedup .",
    "analogous to the instantaneous speed of an object based on the rate of change of its position in euclidean space as calculated using the euclidean metric , the speed of quantum evolution is defined as the changing rate of the position of quantum states on a manifold with appropriate monotone riemannian metrics . the quantum speedup is then detected by any increase of the speed . to further clarify the mechanisms for the quantum speedup ,",
    "the speedup  is divided into two types , i.e. , _ longitudinalspeedup _ and _ _  transverse speedup__. the former arises during the evolution process itself with fixed initial conditions , while the latter is due to a change in the initial conditions .",
    "we then apply the proposed measure to several typical closed and open quantum systems to illustrate the phenomena of longitudinal and transverse speedup .",
    "we find that quantum coherence and entanglement can serve as resources for such speedup only for specific types of quantum states in closed and open systems .",
    "in addition , the memory effect in the given examples is also confirmed to be a subtle but important factor in determining the longitudinal or transverse acceleration of the evolution process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we construct the measure for detecting quantum speedup based on appropriate monotone riemannian metrics . the mechanism for longitudinal and transverse quantum speedup in closed and open systems",
    "is analyzed in sec .",
    "iii with two typical and pedagogical examples .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . iv .",
    "to construct the measure of dynamical speed , let us first recall several notations for quantum states .",
    "the physical state of a quantum system is represented by the density operator @xmath8 , and the set of density operators @xmath9 that we consider here is a subset of bounded operators @xmath10 defined on the finite @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "given the initial state @xmath13 , the dynamics is governed by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the dynamical map book open . from the perspective of the differential geometry of quantum states , the evolved density operators constitute a manifold @xmath16 , and the dynamical map @xmath15 can be treated as a curve on @xmath17 with parameter @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we note that at every time point @xmath18 , the quantum state possesses its own tangent vector space @xmath19 on @xmath9 , which constitutes a tangent vector field @xmath20 on the manifold @xmath16 when the entire process of quantum evolution is considered . to obtain the length of the curve , an appropriate monotone riemannian metric tensor field @xmath21 @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 denotes the scalar field on @xmath16 )",
    "should be given .",
    "then , the line element of the curve is defined as [ note 1 ] @xmath24where @xmath25 denotes the length of any tangent vector @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite@xmath5 the length of the curve is then expressed as @xmath28the above construction allows us to define the instantaneous speed of quantum evolution as    @xmath29    to derive an explicit form of the above quantity , we must select an appropriate monotone riemannian metric .",
    "if the quantum state is pure , then the fubini - study metric is the natural choice . however ,",
    "if the quantum system exists in mixed states , then there are infinitely many monotone riemannian metrics @xcite .",
    "according to the theorem of morozova , chentsov , and petz , any monotone riemannian metric can be represented in the unified form @xmath30 , with @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 denotes the hilbert - schmidt inner product , and @xmath33 is a positive superoperator defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is an operator monotone function @xmath38 being normalized by @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the speed of quantum evolution is given by@xmath40to obtain the above measure in an explicit form , we may rewrite the density operator in the form of its spectral decomposition @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the morozova - chentsov - petz formalism @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ speed-0 ] ) can be immediately written as@xmath44where the symmetric function @xmath45 $ ] is the so - called morozova - chentsov function @xcite related to our chosen riemannian metrics .",
    "we note that any monotone riemannian metric can be employed to evaluate the instantaneous speed of quantum evolution with eq .",
    "( [ speed-1 ] ) as long as the quantum state is in the interior of the space of quantum states , i.e. , @xmath46 however , because a measure of speed should be applicable to both closed and open systems , it is hoped that eq .",
    "( [ speed-1 ] ) could be continuously extended to the boundary of the manifold , i.e. , one or more of @xmath47 vanishes . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ speed-1 ] ) , two kinds of singularity , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 , may appear when we are trying to make an extension to the boundary .",
    "fortunately , the first singularity can be removed by employing a strategy of replacing @xmath51with @xmath52 ( @xmath53 @xcite . however , to our knowledge , there exists only a few monotone riemannian metrics being able to avoid the second kind of singularity [ note2 ] , such as the symmetric logarithmic derivative metric , with @xmath54 , and the wigner - yanase metric , with @xmath55 .",
    "the above consideration is justified when we take the pure state @xmath56 as an example , whose line element is the well known @xmath57 of the fubini - study metric @xcite . here",
    "@xmath58 orthogonal to @xmath59 .",
    "it is convenient to check that , for pure states , the line elements of the symmetric logarithmic derivative metric and the wigner - yanase metric will reduce to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .    in terms of above strategy and",
    "selected metrics , we have @xmath62where we have utilized @xmath63 and @xmath64 as a special case when the system is a closed system with a pure state @xmath65 , it is simple to check that eq . ( [ speed - a ] ) reduces to@xmath66with @xmath67 for the symmetric logarithmic derivative metric and the wigner - yanase metric , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the symmetric logarithmic derivative metric as an example ; extension to the wigner - yanase metric and other potential appropriate metrics book - distance is straightforward",
    ".    equation ( [ speed - a ] ) can now serve as a basis for detecting quantum speedup . clearly , any increase in speed is a signature of dynamical speedup : @xmath68where @xmath69 is the concerned dynamical parameter . in the following , eq .",
    "( [ speed up ] ) ( or @xmath70 ) will be employed as a detection ( or a measure ) for quantum speedup . to clarify the mechanisms underlying speedup phenomena ,",
    "it is of necessity to distinguish two types of speedup : ( i ) _ longitudinalspeedup _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath71 ) , which arises during the evolution process itself with certain initial states and fixed environmental parameters , and ( ii ) _ transverse speedup _ ( i.e. , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) due to a change in the initial conditions ( parameterized by @xmath74 ) , such as the initial states and environmental parameters .",
    "in what follows , we apply the measure constructed above to several simple but pedagogical examples and illustrate the mechanisms corresponding to both longitudinal speedup and transverse speedup .",
    "consider a physical model of spin precession , with a spin-@xmath75 system subjected to a uniform static external magnetic field in the @xmath76 direction .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as book - quantum ( @xmath77 ) @xmath78where @xmath79 is the energy difference between the two spin eigenstates and @xmath80 is the usual pauli operator .",
    "if the system is initially prepared in the superposition state @xmath81 , with @xmath82 then the time evolution of the spin is given by @xmath83 .",
    "( [ speed - b ] ) , we have @xmath84therefore , transverse speedup ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) can be achieved by enhancing the initial coherence of the spin state . with @xmath86(@xmath87 ) given initially in equation ( [ s1 ] ) , the system will evolve at a uniform speed ( i.e. , longitudinal speedup will never occur , for @xmath88 ) .",
    "in particular , the speed of evolution will be zero when @xmath89 .",
    "it is easily understood , for example , that if the system is initially in state @xmath90 , then the evolved state will be @xmath91 , which is precisely identical to @xmath90 .",
    "in fact , both state @xmath92 and state @xmath91 belong to the same ray in projective hilbert space ; hence , the system has not evolved at all .",
    "the previous single - qubit case can be generalized to a bipartite system . under the assumption that no interaction exists between the two spins ,",
    "the evolution is governed by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath93    with @xmath94 @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the identity operator of the spin @xmath97 . for convenience and without loss of generality ,",
    "the initial state is first set to @xmath98 . the corresponding evolved state is then written as @xmath99 . according to eq .",
    "( [ speed - b ] ) , we obtain    @xmath100    which implies that the longitudinal speedup ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) will never occur , but the transverse speedup ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) may be realized by adjusting the initial states .",
    "in fact , the speed in equation ( [ s2 - 1 ] ) is related to the entanglement of the initially prepared state . to demonstrate this fact , we employ wootter s concurrence @xmath102 to measure the entanglement of the bipartite system @xcite .",
    "because the evolved density operator is of the x \" type , the concurrence can be easily deduced to be @xmath103 ( related to initial state ) .",
    "hence , the evolution speed is given by@xmath104illustrating an interesting phenomenon in which quantum entanglement is able to induce transverse speedup ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) through control of the initial states .",
    "nevertheless , we note that not all entangled states possess such a property , e.g. , if the system is initially prepared in the state @xmath106 , it is easy to check , using eq .",
    "( [ speed - b ] ) , that @xmath107 because @xmath108 .",

    "consider a two - level atom coupled to a leaky vacuum cavity with the following hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the resonant transition frequency of the atom between the ground state @xmath120 and the excited state @xmath121 ; @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the pauli raising and lowering operators , respectively ; and @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) denote the frequency and annihilation ( creation ) operator , respectively , of the @xmath127th cavity mode , with @xmath128 being the corresponding coupling constant .",
