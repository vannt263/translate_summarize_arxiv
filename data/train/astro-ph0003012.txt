    "large and homogeneous data sets of near - infrared photometry for the entire lmc , a by - product of large - scale infrared sky surveys such as 2mass @xcite and denis @xcite , have become available to astronomical community only recently .",
    "cioni ( 2000 ) introduced the denis point source catalog towards the magellanic clouds . here , we present the lmc data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "the 2mass has observed the entirety of the large magellanic cloud and much of these data are included in the recent second incremental data release .",
    "empirically , the photometry has signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratio 10 at j , h , k@xmath11 magnitudes of 16.3 , 15.3 , 14.7 , respectively , slightly better than the nominal survey limit . at these limits",
    ", we can observe all of the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) populations and part way down the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "the red clump , representing helium burning giants , lies @xmath12 mag below the sensitivity limit of these data .",
    "the extinction in near - infrared ( nir ) is small throughout the lmc and negligible on average everywhere but the inner degree of arc .",
    "together with the high quality of 2mass photometry ( @xmath13 ) , overall zero - point stability ( better than @xmath14 ) and with reliable identification of lmc populations , the survey is ideal for studies of spatial structure of the lmc or its evolution ( see the companion paper , weinberg & nikolaev 2000 ; hereafter wn ) .",
    "we describe data selection , cross - correlation with a few well - known populations , and comparison of the 2mass color system in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "we present a morphological analysis the color - magnitude diagram in  [ sec : cmd ] .",
    "in particular , we make identifications of the galactic and lmc populations corresponding to all features in the color - magnitude diagram , correlate these with spatial distribution , and estimate the density of lmc populations alone .",
    "the lmc giant branch is well determined and we separately identify the agb , first - ascent red giant branch tip ( trgb ) , and the carbon star sequence . the luminosity function of rgb and agb populations is derived (  [ sec : lf ] ) and compared with the galactic giant - branch luminosity function .",

    "we have examined the source counts as the function of magnitude in dense central fields and in more sparse fields in the outer lmc .",
    "the distribution of source counts as a function of magnitude have similar shapes in both dense and sparse regions , consistent with low confusion .",

    "two are matched by stars of the appropriate magnitudes within @xmath33 radius , and only one does not have any match to within @xmath34 radius .",
    "all 134 wolf - rayet stars in the lmc @xcite have been observed by 2mass @xcite .",

    "based on their data , the difference @xmath38 shows no significant systematic trend in the color range @xmath39 .",
    "the strongest trends follow from the presence of co - band absorption , which affects the @xmath35 filter more than the @xmath25 filter . the absolute value of the difference @xmath40 is less than @xmath41 and we will assume @xmath42 in comparing cit / ctio system - based stellar sequences with 2mass data .",
    "one of the advantages of 2mass as compared to optical surveys is low interstellar reddening , since extinction at @xmath43 m is approximately 10 times smaller than in @xmath44 .",
    "the values of interstellar reddening @xmath45 found in the literature fall in the range between @xmath46 @xcite and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of reddening from harris ( 1997 ) has non - gaussian tail to high values .",

    "he obtained typical lmc internal reddening of @xmath49 ( with substantial variations ) , and foreground reddening in the range @xmath50 .",
    "galactic foreground reddening can be surprisingly large in the outer regions of the lmc : walker ( 1990 ) reported @xmath51 at ngc 1841 , about @xmath52 from the optical center of the lmc .",
    "on the other hand , in the cluster glc 0435 - 59 ( reticulum ) , @xmath53 from the lmc center , the reddening is only @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "zaritsky ( 1999 ) has indicated that reddening for f and g stars in the lmc is much less than that for ob stars and derived the average @xmath55 for late - type stars in the disk .    in the present study",
    ", the data are not dereddened .",
    "rather , each diagram shows the direction and magnitude of the reddening vector for a specified value of @xmath45 .",
    "the reddening vector is based on relations from koornneef ( 1982 ) : @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "information about the reddening may be obtained directly from 2mass data from the analysis of the color - color diagram ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccd ] shows the color - color ( @xmath58 vs. @xmath59 ) diagram of the lmc for @xmath27 2mass sources selected in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the diagram shows relatively few distinct features .",
    "the most prominent among them the extended ` arm ' of the thermally - pulsing agb stars ( tp - agb ) in the upper right corner .",
    "typical colors of lmc m giants are in the range @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "most stars on the extended arm , with colors redder than @xmath62 are carbon - rich stars @xcite . of those with the extremely red colors , @xmath63 , many probably possess dusty circumstellar envelopes .",
    "the sample contains @xmath64 such sources .",
    "their locus is consistent with the track following the reddening vector for @xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccd ] also shows fiducial color tracks for both giants and dwarfs from wainscoat ( 1992 ; hereafter w92 ) .",
    "the two sequences overlap near @xmath66 , @xmath67 , since nir colors of late g  early m type dwarfs are the same as colors of late f  early k type giants .    because of the small number of features and the general compactness of the color - color diagram ,",
    "its usefulness in discriminating the major populations is limited , especially in the overlap region , @xmath68 .",
    "however , some lmc populations which occupy distinct regions in the diagram can still be identified based of their location in the color - color plot ( see figure  [ fig : ccd ] ) . in particular",
    ", the color - color diagram is quite useful in identifying candidate sources with large infrared excess , such as young protostars , cocoon stars , or obscured agb carbon stars .",
    "the color - color diagram may be used to determine the reddening distribution . the giant population forms a tight branch in near - infrared colors .",
    "the reddening direction nearly coincides with @xmath69 and therefore the distribution in @xmath70 of a sample from narrow color interval in @xmath58 along the giant branch provides a sensitive diagnostic for reddening by dust .",
    "we considered a sample of sources in the range @xmath71 .",
    "the resulting shift of the peak is @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) outside ( inside ) of the central region , suggesting only minor reddening on average on scales larger than 0.1 square degrees .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) presented in figure  [ fig : cmdregs ] reveals a wide variety of details .",
    "our goal is reliable identification criteria for lmc stellar populations based on their positions in the diagram .",
    "the cmd is hand - shaped with vertically - stretched ` fingers ' ( e.g. , at @xmath69 colors of 0.4 , 0.6 , 1.1 ) due to varying distance modulus for both galactic and magellanic sources .",
    "we have identified 12 regions shown in figure  [ fig : cmdregs ] that highlight distinct features of the cmd .",
    "the regions are marked a through l and enclose @xmath74 of the @xmath27 sources in the field . to identify stellar populations in each region , we use a combination of several techniques .",
    "the galactic foreground contribution is modeled by a synthetic cmd based on the tabulated near - infrared model of w92 .",
    "the lmc populations are identified based on the infrared photometry of known populations found in the literature .",
    "in addition , we do a preliminary isochrone analysis , where we match the features of the cmd with girardi ( 2000 ) isochrones to derive the ages of populations and draw evolutionary connections among the cmd regions .",
    "the details of our population matching procedure are given in ",
    "[ sec : identify ] .",
    "in addition , we use the spatial density distributions of sources in each region to better discriminate local and lmc populations . the spatial distributions for each region",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : skyregs ] .",
    "= 20.0 cm    in each panel of the figure , we plot source density contour levels of 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 240 , 350 , 480 , 960 , 1920 , 3840 , 7680 , and 15000 .",
    "the contour levels are selected both to show the underlying density profiles with maximum details and facilitate the comparison among different population densities . however , due to strong variations in relative density in the cmd , not all contour levels in this sequence are displayed : in panels e and i the lowest density contour corresponds to 60 , in panels b and c the contours start from 240 , and in very dense region  d the lowest contour level is 960 .",
    "the initial analysis of the cmd regions has two parts : 1 )  use of the spatial density distribution to estimate the location ( galaxy or lmc ) ; and 2 )  use of the theoretical colors / isochrones to derive the properties of the population , such as age , approximate spectral class and distance modulus .",
    "here we describe the procedure of identifying the populations , before examining each region of cmd in detail .    the cmd of the lmc field ( fig .",

    ", we use near - infrared model of w92 , based on 8 - 25 micron point source counts . galactic model of w92 has five structural components : exponential disk , bulge , stellar halo , spiral arms and molecular ring . the main contribution to the galactic source density toward the lmc ( @xmath75 ; @xmath76 )",
    "is the exponential disk .",
    "the source density due to other galactic structural components combined does not exceed @xmath77 in any region of the cmd .",

    "the remainder ( agbs , planetary nebulae , etc . )",
    "are expected to give only a small contribution to source density and thus do not affect the cmd . in the galactic model , we use reddening parameters from rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) .",
    "dust is assumed to follow a double exponential distribution , with the radial scale length of the disk and the scale height of 100 pc .",
    "we reduced the magnitude dispersion @xmath79 of each stellar class by ten to accurately represent the cmd . reducing @xmath79 results in a spiky differential luminosity function but",
    "this does not affect our application and the cumulative luminosity function remains well - approximated .",
    "given the granularity of the model , the agreement between original w92 luminosity function and ours is acceptable .",
    "our synthetic ` foreground ' cmd is shown in figure  [ fig : cmds ] , along with the observed cmd of a galactic field .",
    "these fields were selected at the boundary of our lmc field where contamination from lmc source is minimal . at the time , other contiguous fields were not available . ]",
    "the agreement between the model and observed cmd is good , with few easily explainable discrepancies .",
    "for example , the extension of the cmd at @xmath80 , @xmath81 is due to the population of field galaxies @xcite .",
    "= 9.0 cm    conclusions about the lmc populations in the cmd are made based on isochrone fitting or on empirical matching of populations found in the literature to features of the cmd .",

    "this matching is purely qualitative and is only used as a supplement .",
    "the fiducial colors of galactic giants and supergiants from w92 model are unsuitable for lmc , since lmc has a lower metallicity compared to the milky way .",

    "the loop is the extension of the main northern spiral arm circling the main body of the system and returning toward the bar after a nearly complete turn .",
    "sources in this region of the cmd offer the best opportunity to study the three - dimensional structure of the lmc for two reasons .",
    "first , the spatial coverage of the cloud achieved by 2mass is total and allows to probe the entire lmc .",
    "second , as long - period variables , region  j stars are potentially good standard candles , since their intrinsic luminosity can be characterized based on their period or color . given the selection efficiency and easily quantifiable intrinsic brightness through the period - luminosity - color relation ( e.g. , feast 1989 ) , these stars are excellent probes of the lmc structure along the line of sight . preliminary results ( wn ) indicate that the width of the intrinsic brightness distribution is smaller than @xmath138 magnitudes in a narrow color range , @xmath139 . at this accuracy , these standard candles can resolve features in the lmc at @xmath140 kpc .",
    "2mass detected approximately @xmath141 potential carbon lpvs and these are sufficient to attain a reasonable confidence level in the inferred spatial structure . in weinberg & nikolaev ( 2000 ) , we present our study of the three - dimensional structure of the lmc .      an extension of region  j , region  k contains extremely red objects .",
    "we identify them with obscured agb carbon - rich stars .",
    "their large @xmath69 colors are due to dusty circumstellar envelopes ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the latter is confirmed by the appearance of their spatial and cmd distributions : ( 1 )  figure  [ fig : skyregs]k shows traces of the spiral structure outlined by these sources ; and ( 2 )  the distribution in the cmd spreads from the end of region  j in the direction of reddening vector .",
    "matching with existing near infrared photometry of obscured agb stars in the lmc @xcite shows that most of these sources are indeed in this region of the cmd .",

    "the predicted cmd density in region  l due to galactic stars is too low even after the decrease in the photometric quality near the flux limit has been taken into account ; the decreasing signal - to - noise ratio causes the apparent widening of the contour levels ( see figure  [ fig : cmds ] ) . according to jarrett ( 1998 ) , more than @xmath143 of 2mass galaxies have colors redder than @xmath144 .",
    "the spatial distribution of sources ( figure  [ fig : skyregs]l ) shows some overdensity toward the center of the lmc .",

    "we derive the lmc giant branch luminosity function ( lf ) from the color - magnitude diagram after subtracting galactic foreground .",
    "since we did not have the access to galactic data at the time , the foreground contribution was estimated from three small fields located at the edges of our lmc field .",
    "we then scaled the resulting foreground cmd to the entire lmc field by using the estimate for the number of galactic sources from our synthetic model .",

    "the luminosity function is nearly constant .",
    "it is also well above the expected number from extrapolated rgb counts .",

    "the sharp increase due to galactic m stars , seen in figure  [ fig : lfs]a at @xmath155 , has disappeared in the bar field , because we have boosted the ratio of lmc / galactic counts by narrowing down the field to the area of greatest lmc density .",

    "<S> the conditions that prevailed when 2mass observed the lmc provided @xmath0 limiting sensitivity for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> major populations are identified based on matching morphological features of the color - magnitude diagram with expected positions of known populations , isochrone fits , and analysis of the projected spatial distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> 2mass has detected a significant population of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( @xmath4 sources ) and obscured agb stars ( @xmath5 sources ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lmc populations along the first - ascent red giant branch ( rgb ) and agb are quantified . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the giant luminosity functions in the bar and the outer regions of the lmc shows that both luminosity functions appear consistent with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity function in central ( bar ) field has well - defined drop - off near @xmath6 corresponding to the location of rgb tip ; the same feature is seen in the luminosity function of the entire lmc field .    </S>",
    "<S> isochrone fits for the corresponding giant branches reveal no significant differences in metallicities and ages between central and outer regions of the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> this may be evidence for strong dynamical evolution in the last several gigayears . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the observed lmc giant branch is well - fit by published tracks in the cit / ctio system with a distance modulus of @xmath7 , reddening @xmath8 , metallicity @xmath9 and age @xmath10 gyr . </S>",
