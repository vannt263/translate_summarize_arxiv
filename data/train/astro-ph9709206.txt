    "accurate frequency measurements of thousands of modes of solar acoustic oscillation provide detailed information on the solar interior . in order to use these frequencies to derive internal structure and dynamics of the sun , it is crucial to understand and limit the uncertainties in the computation of solar models and mode frequencies",
    ". furthermore , it is of considerable interest to investigate the sensitivity of solar structure to changes in the input physical parameters and properties of the solar interior .",
    "one of the important physical properties in solar model calculations is the opacity , which is intimately linked to the properties of the solar oscillations through its effects on the mean structure of the sun .",
    "here we investigate the sensitivity of solar structure to local modifications to the opacity .",
    "several authors have investigated the effect of opacity on the solar models and oscillation frequencies . in an early paper , bahcall ,",
    "bahcall & ulrich ( 1969 ) studied the sensitivity of the solar neutrino fluxes to localised changes in the opacity and equation of state and concluded that the neutrino capture rates are more sensitive to the equation of state .",
    "the effects of artificial opacity modifications on the structure of solar models and their frequencies were also examined by christensen - dalsgaard ( 1988 ) .",
    "constructing static models of the present sun with an enhanced opacity near the base of the convection zone , he showed that the changes in structure and frequencies are approximately linear even to an opacity change of 60% .",
    "the linearity of the response of the model to opacity changes was later confirmed by christensen - dalsgaard & thompson ( 1991 ) . in a detailed investigation ,",
    "korzennik & ulrich ( 1989 ) attempted to improve the agreement between the theoretical and observed frequencies of oscillations by determining corrections to the opacity through inverse analysis .",
    "they found that the opacity inversion can only partially resolve the discrepancy . in a similar analysis ,",
    "saio ( 1992 ) obtained opacity corrections by fitting to low - degree frequency separations and helioseismically inferred sound speeds at a few points in the model ; he found that much of the discrepancy between the sun and the model could be removed by opacity changes of up to 50 % .",
    "more recently , elliott ( 1995 ) investigated the helioseismic inverse problem as expressed in terms of corrections to the opacity .",
    "he derived kernels relating the opacity differences to the changes in frequencies , on the assumption that the change in luminosity could be ignored ; he proceeded to carry out inversions for the opacity errors , based on the observed solar oscillation frequencies , and neglecting possible changes in composition associated with the change in opacity .",
    "he found that the differences between observed and computed oscillation frequencies could be accounted for by opacity changes of up to about 5 % .",
    "here we carry out a detailed investigation of the sensitivity of solar structure to localised changes in the opacity , both for static and evolutionary solar models .",
    "the ultimate goal , taken up in a subsequent paper , is to determine the opacity corrections required to account for the helioseismically inferred properties of the solar interior . in general the opacity @xmath0 is a function of density @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 and composition @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is evident that information about the properties of the present sun can not constrain the opacity in such generality .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we consider only opacity modifications that are functions @xmath4 of temperature alone , @xmath5 being the logarithm to base 10 .",
    "if the opacity correction is sufficiently small that higher - order terms can be neglected , the response of any quantity @xmath6 related to solar structure can be expressed in terms of a differential kernel @xmath7 as = k_f(t )  ( t )  t .",
    "[ kernel ]    here for simplicity we estimate the kernels from k_f(t_0 ) = ( f / f)(t_0 ) ( t ) t , [ kdef ] where @xmath8 is the change corresponding to a suitably change @xmath9 localised at @xmath10 .",
    "relations similar to eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) form the basis of inverse analysis ( gough 1985 ) : if @xmath8 is the difference between the observed and theoretical frequencies , eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) can in principle be inverted to determine corrections to the opacity in the model ( korzennik & ulrich 1989 ; saio 1992 ; elliott 1995 ) .",
    "the kernels also provide a powerful visualization of the response in a given physical quantity of the solar model to a small perturbation in the input physics . as an example of this",
    "we evaluate kernels relating opacity changes to the structural differences in the solar model , the neutrino fluxes , and the small frequency separation between low - degree modes .",
    "to illustrate the sensitivity of the models to opacity changes we have computed extensive sets of comparatively simple models .",
    "these were based on the opal opacity tables ( iglesias , rogers & wilson 1992 ) , the eggleton , faulkner & flannery ( 1973 ) equation of state , and nuclear reaction parameters from parker ( 1986 ) and bahcall & ulrich ( 1988 ) .",
    "convection was treated with the mixing - length formulation of bhm - vitense ( 1958 ) .",
    "the neutrino capture rates for the @xmath11cl and @xmath12ga experiments were obtained with the cross - sections given by bahcall ( 1989 ) .",
    "the heavy - element abundance @xmath13 was 0.01895 .",
    "all models were calibrated to a fixed radius ( @xmath14 and luminosity ( @xmath15 ) at the assumed solar age of @xmath16 years by adjusting the mixing - length parameter @xmath17 and the composition .",
    "diffusion and gravitational settling were ignored .",
    "details of the computational procedure were described by christensen - dalsgaard ( 1982 ) .    it should be noted that our models are somewhat simplified , particularly in the choice of equation of state and the neglect of settling , compared with present state - of - the - art solar models ( for a review see , for example , christensen - dalsgaard 1996 ) .",
    "thus the values of the model parameters quoted , e.g. , in table 1 can not be regarded as representative of the actual solar structure .",
    "however , we are here concerned with the _ differential _ effects on the models of changes to the opacity ; for this purpose , the present simplified physics is entirely adequate .",
    "we have considered two types of models : static models of the present sun and proper evolution models , evolved from a chemically homogeneous initial zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) model . in the static models ,",
    "the hydrogen profile @xmath18 where @xmath19 = @xmath20 ( @xmath21 being the mass interior to the given point and @xmath22 is the total mass of the sun ) , was obtained by scaling by a constant factor the profile @xmath23 , obtained from a complete evolution model : x(q ) = x_r(q ) , [ xscale ] where @xmath24 was adjusted to fit the solar luminosity . in the evolution",
    "models the calibration to solar luminosity was achieved by adjusting the initial helium abundance @xmath25 .",
    "the sensitivity of solar structure to opacity was investigated by increasing @xmath0 in a narrowly confined region near a specific temperature @xmath26 according to = _ 0 + f(t_0 ) , where @xmath27 is the opacity as obtained from the opacity tables ; @xmath26 was varied over the temperature range of the model .",
    "the function @xmath28 has the form f(t_0 ) = a , [ kapmod ] where the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 determine the magnitude and width of the opacity modification .",
    "henceforth the models computed with the same input physics but without opacity modifications will be referred to as reference models whereas the perturbed ones will be referred as modified models .    [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is evident that these kernels correspond precisely , apart from a scaling , to the neutrino - flux differences shown in fig . 4b .",
    "also , it is striking that even for the neutrino flux there is little difference between the results for static and evolution models .",
    "in contrast , kernels for the small frequency separation , which depends strongly on the composition gradient in the core , can not be estimated accurately from the static models .",
    "= 8.8 cm    to test these kernels , we use the models of christensen - dalsgaard ( 1992 ) , with reduced core opacity .",
    "specifically , the opacity modification was determined from  =  _ 0  -  a f(t ) , where @xmath31   \\dis ,      & \\mbox{if $ t < t_1$}\\\\ 1 & \\mbox{otherwise ; } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] as did christensen - dalsgaard ( 1992 ) , we used @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this form of @xmath34 provides an opacity decrease over a well defined region in @xmath35 with a continuous transition to zero at lower temperature .",
    "( note that in these models the unmodified opacity @xmath27 was obtained using the los alamos opacity library of huebner 1977 . )",
    "it was found that the neutrino flux was reduced by a factor of more than three for @xmath36 ( see also table  3 ) .",
    "table 3 compares the values of the @xmath37cl neutrino flux and the small frequency separation computed for the models with reduced opacity with those estimated by means of the kernels shown in fig .",
    "it is evident that there is good agreement between the values of @xmath38 for both @xmath39 and 0.4 .",
    "the agreement in neutrino flux is somewhat better for @xmath39 , the error being @xmath40 % for @xmath36 .",
    "however , it is remarkable that linearized expressions of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ kernel ] ) remain reasonably precise for a reduction in opacity by more than a factor of two . to test the precision with which the kernels reproduce the structure of the model , fig .",
    "11 compares differences in @xmath41 and @xmath1 obtained from the kernels in fig . 9 and the corresponding density kernels , with the actual model differences .",
    "results are shown both for the static model sw2 and the evolution model ew2 , both corresponding to @xmath36 .",
    "as before , the agreement is quite close both for evolution and for static models .",
    "our understanding of the solar internal structure has improved significantly over the last few years due to the rapid progress in helioseismology as well as in the construction of solar models with improved input physics .",
    "although much of the knowledge has been obtained through inverse analysis , the starting point is always solar models ; thus it is important to investigate the sensitivity of the solar structure to the input physics and to determine the presence of any region which is particularly sensitive to a specific parameter .",
    "since the major uncertainties in the microphysics come from the opacity , we have focussed on the examination of the solar structure by means of a localised opacity change as a function of temperature .",
    "the sensitivity of the solar structure was represented by kernels relating the opacity changes to neutrino flux , frequency separation at low degree as parametrised by @xmath38 and the structure difference between modified and reference models .",
    "these kernels were subsequently used to derive the same parameters corresponding to a reduction in opacity by a factor of more than two in the models of christensen - dalsgaard ( 1992 ) , simulating the effects of weakly interacting massive particles .",
    "we found that the kernels were remarkably successful in estimating the changes in the solar structure caused by even such a large change in the input physics .",
    "a natural next step in this investigation is to study systematically how the oscillation frequencies are affected by opacity changes and also how well these frequency changes can be reproduced by kernels .",
    "furthermore , in a preliminary analysis tripathy , basu & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1997 ) found that much of the current discrepancy between the helioseismically inferred solar sound speed and the sound speed of a standard solar model can be understood in terms of modest modifications to the opacity .",
    "more detailed analyses of this nature are now under way .",
    "we thank s. basu and j. elliott for useful discussion as well as for comments on the manuscript .",
    "jc - d is grateful to the high altitude observatory for hospitality during much of the preparation of the paper .",
    "the work was supported in by danish natural science research council , and by the danish national research foundation through its establishment of the theoretical astrophysics center .",
    "sct acknowledges financial support from the department of science and technology , government of india .",
    "for convenience , we present some simple approximate properties of convective envelopes , which are useful for the interpretation of the numerical results in sect .  4.2 .",
    "further details were provided by christensen - dalsgaard ( 1997 ) .",
    "note also that baturin & ayukov ( 1995 , 1996 ) carried out a careful analysis of the properties of convective envelopes and their match to the radiative interior .    in the convection zone",
    "the stratification departs substantially from being adiabatic only in a very thin region just below the photosphere .",
    "thus the structure of the bulk of the convection zone is determined by the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium = - g m r^2 [ hydro ] ( @xmath42 being the gravitational constant and @xmath21 the mass interior to @xmath43 ) , and the relation .",
    "[ gamma ] to this approximation , the convection - zone structure therefore depends only on the equation of state , the composition and the constant specific entropy @xmath44 , the latter being fixed by the mixing - length parameter @xmath17 . in practice ,",
    "a more useful characterization of the bulk of the convection zone follows from noting that @xmath45 is approximately constant outside the dominant ionization zones of hydrogen and helium ; then eq .  ( [ gamma ] ) shows that @xmath46 and @xmath1 are related by p k ^_1 , [ prho ] where the constant @xmath47 is closely related to @xmath44 .",
    "assuming @xmath45 again to be constant and neglecting the mass in the convection zone , it is readily shown from eqs  ( [ hydro ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) that @xmath48 is given by u g m ( 1 - 1 _ 1 ) ( 1 r - 1 r^ * ) , [ solu ] approximately valid in the lower parts of the convection zone ( e.g. christensen - dalsgaard 1986 ; dziembowski , pamyatnykh & sienkiewicz 1992 ; christensen - dalsgaard & dppen 1992 ; baturin & mironova 1995 ) ; here @xmath22 is the mass of the model and @xmath49 , its surface radius . from eqs  ( [ prho ] ) and ( [ solu ] ) we also obtain p^1 - 1/_1 k^-1/_1 _ 1 -1 _ 1 g m ( 1 r - 1 r _ * ) . [ solp ]    eq .",
    "( [ solu ] ) indicates that @xmath50 , and therefore @xmath51 , depend little on the details of the physics of the model ; in particular , if @xmath22 and @xmath52 are assumed to be fixed , as in the case of calibrated solar models , @xmath53 . this is confirmed by figs  [ statdiff ] and [ evoldiff ] , which show that @xmath54 is very small in the bulk of the convection zone . from eq .",
    "( [ solp ] ) it furthermore follows that p - 1 _ 1 - 1 k [ deltap ] are approximately constant , again in accordance with figs  [ statdiff ] and [ evoldiff ] . finally , assuming the ideal gas law",
    ", we have that t . [ deltat ]    these relations",
    "may be used to investigate the changes in the model resulting from changes in the convection - zone parameters .",
    "of particular interest are conditions at the base of the convective envelope , defining the match to the radiative interior . neglecting possible convective overshoot , @xmath55 , the radiative temperature gradient , at this point . for calibrated models",
    "the luminosity @xmath56 is unchanged ; then @xmath57 .",
    "assuming also that @xmath58 is constant and that the heavy - element abundance @xmath13 is fixed , we find that the change in the pressure @xmath59 at the base of the convection zone is related to the changes in @xmath47 and the envelope hydrogen abundance @xmath60 by & & - 4 - _ t ( 4 - _ t ) ( _ 1 - 1 ) - _ 1(_p + 1 ) k + & & - _ 1 [ ( 4 - _ t ) _ x - _ x ] ( 4 - _ t ) ( _ 1 - 1 ) - _ 1(_p + 1 ) [ delpcz ] ( see also christensen - dalsgaard 1997 ) ; here _ p = ( / p)_t , x ,",
    "_ t = ( / t)_p , x , + _ x = ( / x)_p , t , _ x = ( / x)_z . having obtained @xmath61 , the change in the depth of the convection zone can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ solp ] ) as [ k + ( _ 1 - 1 ) ] , [ deldcz ] where @xmath62 is the radius at the base of the convection zone .",
    "[ note that this relation differs from eq .",
    "( 11 ) of christensen - dalsgaard ( 1997 ) .",
    "there it was assumed that the interior properties of the model were largely unchanged while the surface radius was allowed to change ; this is the case relevant , for example , to the calibration of solar models to have a specific radius .",
    "here we have kept @xmath52 fixed and the change in @xmath63 corresponds to changes in the properties of the radiative interior of the model . ]",
    "it is of some interest to compare these simple relations with the numerical results obtained for the envelope models listed in table 2 .",
    "to do so , we first need to relate the change in @xmath47 to the changes in @xmath17 and @xmath60 . from the results in table 2 ( k ) _",
    "-1.40 , ( k ) _ 1.90 .",
    "[ numder ] as discussed by christensen - dalsgaard ( 1997 ) , the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath47 , at fixed composition , follows simply from the properties of the mixing - length theory ; the result of such an analysis , using the properties of the reference envelope model en1 , agrees quite closely with the value given above .",
    "it is less straightforward to derive a simple expression for the relation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "to evaluate the changes in @xmath59 and @xmath63 , we need the derivatives of @xmath0 and @xmath66 . at the base of the convection zone in the reference envelope en1 we have the following values : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , from eq .",

    "evidently , the @xmath17-derivative is in reasonable agreement with eq .",
