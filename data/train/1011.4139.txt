    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are classified by luminosity and by phenomenological criteria .",
    "the most luminous objects are the radio - loud quasars ( quasi - stellar radio sources ) and the radio - quiet qsos ( quasi - stellar objects ) .",
    "radio - loud objects are characterized by relativistic jets . since the jet emission of the radio - loud objects is likely to dilute the x - ray spectrum from the central engine of the agn , radio - quiet objects are more suitable for the study of x - ray emission associated with the accretion disk .    to date ,",
    "detailed information on the x - ray spectra of radio - quiet agns has largely been derived from observations of nearby flux - bright objects .",
    "spectroscopy of low luminosity ( @xmath8erg s@xmath1 ) radio - quiet seyfert galaxies has revealed a relatively complex multi - component x - ray spectrum . in the soft x - rays , a steep component ( soft excess )",
    "has been observed in many cases . in the past",
    "this component has been interpreted as the tail of the thermal emission from the accretion disk or comptonization of euv accretion disk photons ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite discuss ionized disk reflection as an explanation .",
    "the spectrum at soft x - rays can also be influenced by a cold or warm absorber . following this observation ,",
    "@xcite consider absorption along the line of sight from relativistically outflowing , optically thin , warm gas as an explanation for the soft excess . at higher energies ,",
    "x - ray spectra are dominated by a hard ( @xmath9@xmath72 ) power law , attributed to inverse compton emission from a hot , thin corona surrounding the accretion disk .",
    "furthermore , compton reflection of the primary flux by the disk or torus is inferred by the detection of a 6.4 kev fluorescent fe k@xmath2 line and the 7.1 kev fe absorption edge in agn spectra . the first narrow , unresolved fe k@xmath2 line in an agn",
    "was observed in _",
    "oso-8 _ spectra of centaurus a by @xcite .",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations have shown that a narrow ( fwhm up to @xmath7 @xmath10 km s@xmath1 due to doppler broadening ) fe line component is virtually ubiquitous in seyfert spectra and indicates emission from gas roughly commensurate with the optical broad line region ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and/or emission from the putative compton - thick , homogeneous molecular torus invoked in seyfert type i / ii unification schemes and thought to be located about light - years from the supermassive black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a relativistically broadened ( fwhm@xmath11 km s@xmath1 ) component indicates emission from within a few @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) of the black hole where @xmath14 is the black hole mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) but appears in only about half of seyferts ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is evidence for the narrow fe k@xmath2 equivalent width to be anti - correlated with x - ray luminosity , the so - called x - ray baldwin effect .",
    "this effect has been documented in several agn samples , including @xcite using _ ginga _ , @xcite using _",
    "asca _ , and @xcite using _ xmm - newton_. however , the fitted correlation is mainly due to @xmath15erg s@xmath1 objects ( @xcite ) .    improving the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) by stacking the x - ray spectra of high - redshift agns is a common method for high - redshift agns .",
    "@xcite stack the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of agns in the lockman hole survey , which covers a large range of luminosities and redshifts . in the average spectra of both type i and type ii objects they find significant fe fluorescent emission , which seemed to be relativistically blurred (",
    "type i agns : ew@xmath7600 ev , type ii agns : ew@xmath7400 ev ) . in comparison ,",
    "recent studies such as the _ xmm - newton _ wide angle survey by @xcite find only a narrow unresolved fe line of ew@xmath790 ev in the stacked spectrum of 606 type i agns .",
    "@xcite determine the mean continuum shape of 487 agns in the _ xmm - newton _ wide angle survey by stacking the spectra at different cosmic epochs .",
    "the _ rosat _ bright survey ( rbs ; @xcite ) identifies the brightest ( 0.12.4 kev count rate @xmath160.2ct s@xmath1 , flux limit @xmath17 erg @xmath18 s@xmath1 ) x - ray sources from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) at high galactic latitudes .",
    "x - ray luminous radio - quiet qsos are rare locally and their spectral properties are so far poorly established . due to their high x - ray flux ,",
    "the rbs objects form an ideal sample to obtain the most statistically significant x - ray spectra and allows us to evaluate directly their x - ray spectral properties and the properties ( @xmath19 , ew ) of their fe k@xmath2 lines . in this paper",
    ", we use _ xmm - newton _ to study the spectral properties of four objects that belong to the 12 most x - ray luminous radio - quiet qsos found in the rbs with @xmath20 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "such analysis of the most luminous rbs - qsos will test the assumption of having very similar x - ray agn properties when stacking their x - ray spectra .",
    "the sample will serve as a medium-@xmath21 reference for the interpretation of low s / n qso spectra at high redshifts .",
    "in addition , the ew of the fe k@xmath2 line will be directly accessible in the individual x - ray spectra .",
    "this will add several data points in the poorly studied high luminosity range of the x - ray baldwin effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe how we selected the sample .",
    "section  3 gives black hole mass and eddington ratio estimates from optical spectra . in section  4 the x - ray data reduction",

    "the identification program of 2042 rbs sources reaches a spectroscopic completeness ratio of more than 99.5% .",
    "we preselect objects that are classified as agns and sort them in descending order of their galactic - absorption corrected 0.52 kev luminosity . bl lac objects are not considered for this study . since we are interested only in radio - quiet agns , we furthermore exclude radio - loud agns by their radio - to - optical flux density @xmath31 ( @xcite ) . the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned )",

    "another possible scenario of maintaining neutral material very close to very luminous agns may be non - isotropic emission of the ionizing continuum radiation .",
    "the pg quasar sample shows that the detection of relativistically broadened fe lines is not common for high luminous agns except in three cases .",

    "consequently , our results do not allow a conclusion on similar or different physical properties in the accretion disk very close to the central engine in low and high luminous agns .",
    "low-@xmath21 agns vary significantly in their individual x - ray spectral components and feature a wide range of frequency of partial coverers , warm absorbers , soft excess shapes and strengths , and/or compton reflection hump strengths .",
    "it is therefore not straightforward to compare our results to a somewhat typical low-@xmath21 agn to evaluate what changes have to be applied to the x - ray spectrum ( except the much higher luminosity ) to turn a low-@xmath21 agn into one of the most luminous qsos .",
    "since we are left with the situation where our rbs - qso spectra can be well fitted with power law and self - consistent reflection disk models ( epic and rgs data ) , we decided to compare our findings with @xcite .",
    "they used a sample of 34 mainly low - redshift seyfert i galaxies and type i agns to show that in 25 out of 34 sources , relativistically blurred disk reflection models are a significantly better fit than a plbb model .",
    "all three of our high s / n rbs - qso observations are better fitted with reflection disk models than plbb models . however , a 2pl fit is almost as good as a reflection model , because the extremely smooth soft excess in the epic and rgs data is well fitted by a soft power law . a reflection model has to accomplish the modeling of the smooth soft excess similar to a power law and requires a high degree of relativistically blurring to smear out the sharp soft x - ray emission lines caused by reflection from the disk .",
    "this is achieved by either very high ionization parameters , small inner disk radii , or high emissivity indices ( causing the emission of the major fraction of the radiation within very small inner radii ) , or a combination of those . in this case",
    ", the limited parameter space no longer allows modeling of the fe line in a satisfying way as in refl1 and refl2 , requiring us to include the extra , narrow fe component as in refl1 g and refl2 g .",
    "moreover , we find a degeneracy in the disk reflection model between accretion disk states at seemingly opposite physical extremes : refl1 has a very low ionization parameter and accounts only for @xmath75%20% of the total 0.212 kev flux , while refl2 exhibits a very high disk ionization parameter ( @xmath735%75% of the total output ) .",
    "some objects in the @xcite sample ( e.g. , ton s180 , where the soft excess is also better modeled with a power law rather than a blackbody model ) also have a very smooth soft excess and require high ionization parameters and high emissivity indices .",
    "@xcite allow the emissivity index to vary freely for all their sources and find an index higher than 6 for 22 sources .",
    "only two of their sources are consistent with an index below or equal to 3 . leaving the emissivity index free to vary in our fits results in unconstrained values in most of the cases due to the limited s / n . only for rbs 320 and refl2 of the rbs 1124 _ suzaku _ observation we achieve well constrained emissivity indices higher than 6 .",
    "@xcite find very small inner disk radii indicating fast rotating kerr black holes which is in agreement with our data .",
    "interestingly , their 0.312 kev flux fraction for the disk reflection models is always above 0.25 which contradicts our models refl1 and refl1 g ( low ionization parameter ; flux fraction @xmath75%20% ) .",
    "the best - fit ionization parameters in @xcite cover a wide range including the values found for our rbs - qsos .",
    "they also find that most sources have similar spectral indices with both models ( plbb and disk reflection ) , while several sources have higher indices with the disk reflection model .",
    "the ranges of our plbb and refl1 g photon indices agree well with the correlation given by @xcite . for refl2 g",
    "we find lower spectral indices than with a plbb .",
    "none of the degenerate disk reflection scenarios , i.e. , low / high ionization parameter , for our rbs - qsos can be favored or ruled out .",
    "the limited s / n of the rgs data also does not allow any constraints . if the soft excess in these objects is not caused by reflection in the innermost disk , there is in general no need for relativistical disk reflection models in our high luminosity qsos as the observed fe line does not originate from the inner disk although we can not rule out the possibility that there may exist a weak broad fe line .",
    "either the basic assumptions of reflection models ( e.g. , geometrically flat accretion disk , gas of constant density , etc . )",
    "are not valid for the most luminous qsos , or different sets of models are required to describe their physics .",
    "if , on the other hand , reflection models turn out to be the right interpretation for very luminous qsos , this would support the assumption by @xcite that high luminosity radio - quiet qsos have identical x - ray continuum properties as those found in lower - luminosity agns and seyfert i galaxies and therefore similar physical processes are likely to govern accretion disks over a wide range of luminosities and accretion rates .      in this section",
    "we want to explore if our stacked high s / n rbs - qso spectrum can serve as a template spectrum for low s / n spectra of luminous qsos at higher redshifts ( @xmath310 ) .",
    "the pg quasar sample of @xcite contains five objects with @xmath311 ( up to @xmath312 ) and x - ray luminosities of @xmath313 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "these objects have an average 212 kev photon index @xmath314 with a typical error of @xmath315 .",
    "our photon index for the stacked rbs - qso spectrum shifted to @xmath316 is @xmath317 .",
    "taking into account the slightly different energy range for the determination of the photon indices and the involved uncertainties , both values are in good agreement .",
    "although we are aware of the large uncertainties in using a sample of only three objects , we derive the average soft and hard photon indices for the three @xmath311 objects of @xcite .",
    "their @xmath318 and @xmath319 agree well with the 2pl fit to our stacked rbs - qso spectrum ( @xmath256 , @xmath255 ) .",
    "the limited s / n for luminous qsos at high redshifts restricts the knowledge that can be gained from these objects . by stacking the individual x - ray spectra the s / n",
    "is improved significantly and the added spectrum can be used for further analysis which is not feasible on individual spectra .",
    "however , the interpretation of stacked spectra _ a priori _ assumes that the intrinsic x - ray properties in the sample are very similar .",
    "radio - quiet agns correspond to the vast majority ( @xmath790% ) of all agns . although limited to only four objects at the present , our rbs - qsos are found to have surprisingly homogenous properties in their x - ray spectra .",
    "this confirms the stacking technique assumption of very similar properties in the individual spectra at least for very luminous qsos .    in one of the largest samples , @xcite stack the spectra of 487 type i agns in the _ xmm - newton _ wide angle survey ( xwas ) in different redshift bins .",
    "the two highest redshift bin subsamples with @xmath320 and @xmath321 erg s@xmath1 both yield a best - fit photon index of @xmath322 .",

    "@xcite use 507 agns from the 2xmm catalog and find for subsamples with @xmath330 erg s@xmath1 in a redshift range of @xmath331 upper limits on the ew also consistent with our values .",
    "these new stacking results and our direct measurements for the rbs - qsos significantly disagree with the large ews found by @xcite and @xcite using the stacking technique .",
    "a unique and important contribution of our study is that we can test the x - ray baldwin effect , the anti - correlation between x - ray luminosity and ew of the narrow fe line ( @xcite ) , for the most luminous qsos .",

    "@xcite question the significance of the effect by finding only a 30% probability that the ew and the 210 kev luminosity are correlated .",
    "they and @xcite both argue that the effect is mainly due to the radio - loud sources in the sample .",
    "the main problem is that the fitted correlation for the x - ray baldwin effect comes mainly from agns with @xmath332 } \\le 4\\times 10^{44}$ ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite note that more luminous radio - quiet qsos with high s / n are needed for a solid analysis of the x - ray baldwin effect .",
    "our study adds three data points to this very poorly studied luminosity range , with ew@xmath333 ev ( @xmath5ew@xmath292 ) .",
    "this is still consistent with the pg quasar average value of @xmath5ew@xmath334 ev with an dispersion of @xmath335 ev ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on our 210 kev luminosities , we calculate the expected ew from the best - fit of @xcite ( their equation  1 , sample of radio - quiet agns ) .",
    "the expected values of ew@xmath336 ev are significantly lower than what we measure in our rbs - qsos ( figure  [ baldwin ] ) . except for rbs 1124 (",
    "_ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations ) , the values disagree at the @xmath1690% confidence level .",
    "however , other studies also find much higher ews ( as predicted by the x - ray baldwin effect ) of @xmath7100 ev for @xmath337 erg s@xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ baldwin ] only contains objects from @xcite that have a line energy consistent with @xmath3 kev . their sample and the sample of @xcite have 25 pg quasars in common .",
    "although consistent within their uncertainties , the derived ew values for detected fe lines by @xcite are systematically lower because , in contrast to @xcite , they fixed the line energy to @xmath3 kev ( s. bianchi , private communication ) .    based on our study of rbs - qsos , and on the @xmath338ew relations of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that the x - ray baldwin effect , the proposed anti - correlation between x - ray luminosity and ew of the narrow fe line , is only present up to @xmath339 erg s@xmath1 . above this luminosity threshold ,",
    "there is convincing evidence for a flattening of the x - ray baldwin effect or even a luminosity independent value of the equivalent width of @xmath5ew@xmath340 ev .",
    "we hereby redefine the x - ray baldwin effect not only as the proposed anti - correlation between @xmath341 and ew but also as the flattening above @xmath339 erg s@xmath1 to cover a luminosity range as wide as possible . with current data samples , we are not able to tell if this flattening applies only to radio - quiet qsos or for all qsos",
    ". however , the flattening would explain the discrepancy in the significance of the x - ray baldwin effect when different luminosity ranges are explored , such as the very high luminosity range for pg quasars in @xcite .",
    "the most fundamental question concerning the x - ray baldwin effect is the physical cause why the behavior changes above @xmath339 erg s@xmath1 . depending on the origin of the fe line ,",
    "different explanations are suggested . if the flattening or constant ews above @xmath339 erg s@xmath1 prove to be solid , either some physical process reaches its limit at this luminosity or two different mechanisms / origins of the fe line are causing the x - ray baldwin effect . for our objects ,",
    "the x - ray baldwin effect is most likely not caused by the notion that an increase in x - ray luminosity progressively further ionizes the upper layers of the disk and therefore decreases the strength of the line ( @xcite ) because the main contribution to the observed fe line does not seem to be located in the inner disk region .",
    "other possible explanations are that with increasing luminosity , the inner radius of the torus surrounding the supermassive black hole increases up to a certain limit or the covering factor or thickness of the torus is decreasing ( @xcite ) . if the origin can be constrained to be in the torus , this luminosity - dependent covering factor may be directly linked to the decrease of the fraction of obscured agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "both scenarios lead to a lower amount of reprocessed radiation and therefore lower observed neutral reflection and narrow fe emission line strengths",
    ". however , the model still has to explain the high accretion rates found in rbs - qso that seem to be sustained over a long period of time .",
    "we select the 12 most luminous radio - quiet qsos from the _ rosat _ bright survey ( rbs ) and present the first mini - survey of four of these sources .",
    "they each have @xmath20 erg s@xmath1 , radio - to - optical flux densities @xmath342 , and allow us to study the accretion disk properties at the very high end of the qso luminosity function .",
    "these four objects have @xmath343 and each have been observed with _ xmm - newton _ ; rbs 1124 has also been observed with _ suzaku _ ( @xcite ) . using emission lines from optical spectra , we estimate black hole masses of log(@xmath59)@xmath344 and eddington ratios of @xmath345 for these objects . therefore , the outstanding luminosities are a combination of high but not extreme black hole masses and eddington ratios . the _ xmm - newton _ 0.52 kev fluxes vary only @xmath75%20% from the _ rosat _ fluxes , while the _ suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of rbs 1124 show a 50% flux increase in only 13 months .",
    "the optical - to - x - ray spectral indices of our objects cover the same range found in other _ rosat",
    "_ selected agn samples .",
    "all 0.212 kev _ xmm - newton _ spectra show very homogenous properties , implying that the physical properties in the individual accretion disks are most likely very similar in this uniformly selected sample .",
    "the data of the three high s / n objects are well described by either ( 1 ) a model with two power laws or ( 2 ) an incident power law and its reflection off the accretion disk very close to the black hole , but in all cases , we also have to model the presence of a narrow / barely resolved fe line originating in neutral material light - days or further from the central x - ray source with an additional gaussian line profile .",
    "reflection models alone are not able to explain the strength of the fe line . two degenerate disk reflection model scenarios , which lie in seemingly very different areas of parameter space ,",
    "are found for the high s / n spectra : ( 1 ) a disk with a very low ionization parameter ( refl1 ) with a reflection component which makes up only @xmath75%20% of the total output or ( 2 ) a disk with a very high ionization parameter ( refl2as almost expected for very luminous qsos ) with a reflection component that accounts for @xmath735%75% of the total output . due to the weak contribution of the reflection component in refl1 , even the limited s / n rgs data do not allow us to favor either model .",
    "this degeneracy in the disk reflection model has to be broken by either more advanced models ( maybe disk reflection models are even inappropriate for very luminosity radio - quiet qsos ) or extremely high - resolution spectra such as those which will be obtained by upcoming x - ray missions such as _ astro - h _ ( @xcite ) and _ ixo _ ( @xcite ) to identify the physical properties of the accretion disk in the most luminous radio - quiet qsos .",
    "both scenarios are consistent with the presence of fast rotating kerr black holes .",
    "the soft excess in each source is well fitted by a power law , and its strength ( 2%26% of the total 0.52 kev emission ) is weaker than in lower luminous radio - quiet agn / qsos where the soft excess is typically 30% of the total 0.52 kev emission .",
    "no significant evidence for neutral absorption in excess of the galactic absorption and for partial / full - covering absorption by ionized material is found .",
    "the rgs data confirm the extreme smoothness of the soft excess and the absence of ionized absorbers .",
    "the major fraction of the fe line emission in our three high s / n rbs - qsos has to come from lowly - ionized or neutral material located only a few light days ( or further ) out , but a superimposed very weak relativistically broadened fe line from the inner disk can not be ruled out ( 90% confidence level upper limits from fitting laor components : @xmath70.140.40 kev ) .",
    "it remains unclear how a considerable fraction of the line - emitting material can avoid becoming highly ionized so close to the central x - ray source of the most luminous qsos .",
    "we also test the x - ray baldwin effect in the poorly studied high luminosity range .",
    "the detected fe line equivalent widths of 70140 ev from our three high s / n rbs - qso spectra are significant higher than expected by extension of the x - ray baldwin effect from lower luminosity regimes ( @xcite ) . based on our results and the findings by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we claim that the x - ray baldwin anti - correlation is only present in radio - quiet agns with @xmath346 erg s@xmath1 and above this luminosity , the observed ew flattens ( @xmath5ew@xmath347 ev ) .",
    "although our present sample is only limited to four objects , we can confirm the stacking technique assumption of having very similar intrinsic properties in the individual spectra for very luminous qsos .",
