    "the canonical example of particle dm is weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "in many theories wimps are their own antiparticles and annihilate among themselves wherever the dm density is high .",
    "recently there has been much excitement in the dark matter community about possible detections of wimps via annihilation to positrons seen by the pamela satellite ( adriani et al .",
    "2009 ) ; annihilation to @xmath11-rays seen by fermi ( abdo et al .",

    "the first stars are particularly good sites for annihilation : they form in the right place  in the high density centers of dm haloes  and at the right time  at high redshifts ( density scales as @xmath15 ) .",
    "spolyar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that above a certain density ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) the wimp annihilation products remain trapped in the star , thermalize with the star , and thereby provide a heat source .",
    "these first dark stars ( ds ) are stars made primarily of hydrogen and helium with only @xmath18% of the mass in the form of dm ; yet they shine due to dm heating .",
    "note that the term dark refers to the power source , not the appearance or the primary matter constituent of the star .",
    "dark stars are born with masses @xmath19 .",
    "they are giant puffy ( @xmath20 au ) , cool ( surface temperatures @xmath21k ) , yet bright @xmath22 objects ( freese et al .",
    "they reside in a large reservoir ( @xmath23 ) of baryons , i.e. , @xmath24% of the total halo mass",
    ". these baryons can start to accrete onto the dark stars .",
    "previous work ( freese et al . 2008a ; spolyar et al . 2009 ) followed the evolution of dark stars from their inception at @xmath25 , as they accreted baryons from the surrounding halo , up to @xmath26 .",
    "dark stars can continue to grow in mass as long as there is a supply of dm fuel .",
    "the exciting new development of this paper is that we follow the growth of dark stars to become supermassive dark stars ( smds ) of mass @xmath27 .",
    "specifically we study the formation of @xmath28 smds in @xmath29 dm haloes and @xmath30 smds in @xmath31 haloes ; perhaps the smdss become even larger .",
    "hoyle & fowler ( 1963 ) first postulated the existence of such large stars but were not aware of a mechanism for making them .",
    "now the confluence of particle physics with astrophysics may be providing the answer . the key ingredient that allows dark stars to grow so much larger than ordinary fusion powered population iii stars",
    "is the fact that dark stars are so much cooler .",
    "ordinary pop iii stars have much larger surface temperatures in excess of 50,000k .",
    "they produce ionizing photons that provide a variety of feedback mechanisms that cut off further accretion .",
    "mckee & tan ( 2008 ) have estimated that the resultant pop iii stellar masses are @xmath32 .",
    "dark stars are very different from fusion - powered stars , and their cooler surface temperatures allow continued accretion of baryons all the way up to enormous stellar masses , @xmath33 .",
    "wimp annihilation produces energy at a rate per unit volume @xmath34 where @xmath13 is the wimp number density , @xmath35 is the wimp mass , and @xmath36 is the wimp energy density .",
    "the annihilation products typically are electrons , photons , and neutrinos .",
    "the neutrinos escape the star , while the other annihilation products are trapped in the dark star , thermalize with the star , and heat it up .",
    "the luminosity from the dm heating is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fraction of the annihilation energy deposited in the star ( not lost to neutrinos ) and @xmath39 is the volume element .",
    "we take @xmath40 as is typical for wimps .",
    "typically @xmath41 of dark matter ( up to @xmath42 of the halo mass ) must be consumed by the star in order for large smds masses @xmath43 to be reached .",
    "we will consider two different scenarios for supplying this amount of dark matter : 0.1 in 1 ) extended adiabatic contraction , labeled `` without capture '' below . in this case ,",
    "dark matter is supplied by the gravitational attraction of the baryons in the star .",
    "the amount of dm available for dm annihilation due to adiabatic contraction may be larger than our previous estimates which were based on the assumption that dm halos are spherical . in a non - spherical dm halo ,",
    "the supply of dm available to the star can be considerably enhanced , as we discuss in more detail in  [ dmdens ] . in any case",
    ", this mechanism relies solely on the particle physics of wimp annihilation and does not include capture of dm by baryons ( discussed below ) .",
    "\\2 ) extended capture , labeled `` with capture '' below . here",
    ", the star is initially powered by the dm from adiabatic contraction ( ac ) , but the ac phase is taken to be short @xmath44 years ; once this dm runs out the star shrinks , its density increases , and subsequently the dm is replenished inside the star by capture of dm from the surroundings ( freese et al .",
    "2008b ; iocci 2008 ) as it scatters elastically off of nuclei in the star . in this case , the additional particle physics ingredient of wimp scattering is required .",
    "this elastic scattering is the same mechanism that direct detection experiments ( e.g. cdms , xenon , lux , dama ) are using in their hunt for wimps . in previous work (",
    "freese et al . 2008a ; spolyar et al . 2009 ) , we assumed minimal capture , where dm heating and fusion contributed equally to the luminosity once the star reached the main sequence . here",
    ", we consider the more sensible case where dm heating dominates completely due to larger ambient dm density , and the star can grow to become supermassive .",
    "supermassive dark stars can result from either of these mechanisms for dm refueling inside the star .",
    "the smds can live for a very long time , tens to hundreds of million years , or possibly longer ( even to today ) .",
    "we find that @xmath23 sdmss are very bright @xmath45 which makes them potentially observable by james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .",
    "we also note that smds may become even more massive a ) if they form in larger haloes or b ) the dm haloes in which they initially form merge with other haloes so that there is even more matter to accrete ( n.b . alternatively these mergers",
    "may remove the ds from their high dm homes and stop the dm heating ) .",
    "for example , if dark stars form in @xmath31 haloes , then they could in principle grow to contain all the baryons in the halo , i.e. @xmath46 . since the luminosity scales as @xmath47 these smds would be even brighter , @xmath48 and are hence even better candidates for discovery in jwst .",
    "once the smds run out of dm fuel , they contract and heat up .",
    "the core reaches @xmath49k and fusion begins . as fusion - powered stars they do nt last very long before collapsing to black holes .",
    "again , this prediction is different from standard pop iii stars , many of which explode as pair - instabilty supernovae ( heger & woosley 2002 ) with predicted even / odd element abundance ratios that are not ( yet ) observed in nature .",
    "the massive black holes ( bh ) remnants of the smdss are good candidates for explaining the existence of @xmath50 bhs which are the central engines of the most distant ( @xmath51 ) quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( fan et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "the idea of supermassive ds and the resultant @xmath52 bh was originally proposed by spolyar et al .",
    "subsequently umeda et al .",
    "( 2009 ) took their existing stellar codes and added dm annihilation to allow the mass to grow .",
    "they started from population iii stars in which fusion was already present , assuming they then encounter a reservoir of dm .",
    "our work differs in that we start from the very beginning with collapsing protostellar clouds that transition into dark stars , which can be dm powered for millions to billions of years before fusion ever begins .",
    "our smdss are truly primordial supermassive stars .",
    "begelman ( 2009 ) presents another alternative for the formation of supermassive stars : rapid accretion onto stars which already have hydrogen burning in them .",
    "his `` quasistars '' , another possible route to large bh , are quite different from the sdms discussed in this paper .",

    "( 2007 ) , bertone & fairbairn ( 2007 ) and scott et al .",
    "other constraints on ds will arise from cosmological considerations .",
    "a first study of their effects ( and those of the resultant ms stars ) on reionization has been done by schleicher et al.(2008 , 2009 ) and further work in this direction is warranted .    in this paper",
    "we examine the smds that result from the two mechanisms discussed above for dm refueling inside the star . in section",
    "ii we discuss the procedure for calculation of models ; in section iii we present results ; and in section iv we end with a discussion .",
    "dm heating is very different from fusion . in order to overcome the coulomb barriers between nuclei , fusion requires very high temperatures and densities in the star .",
    "fusion is not very efficient in that only @xmath55 of the nuclear mass is converted to heat .",
    "wimp annihilation , on the other hand , takes place at high dark matter densities regardless of the temperature .",
    "it is almost 100% efficient since o(1 ) of the wimp mass is converted to useful energy .",
    "thus , in the evolution of the first protostars , dm heating becomes important early .",
    "here we start the calculation when the ds is massive enough ( 3 m@xmath56 ) so that it is in hydrostatic equilibrium and most of the hydrogen and helium is ionized .",
    "the contribution to dm luminosity is roughly constant as a function of radius throughout the ds , unlike fusion which takes place only at the ( high temperature ) core of the star .",
    "we use the numerical code previously discussed in detail by freese et al .",
    "( 2008a ) and spolyar et al .",
    "we make the assumption that a ds can be described as a polytrope @xmath57 in hydrostatic equilibrium . here",
    "@xmath58 is the pressure , @xmath59 is the density , and @xmath60 is a constant .",
    "we solve the equations of stellar structure with polytropic index @xmath61 initially 1.5 , as appropriate for convective stars , and made a gradual transition to @xmath62 as the star becomes radiative in the later phases .",
    "we require that at each time - step during the accretion process the star is in hydrostatic equilibrium , [ hydro ] = -(r ) where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the mass enclosed in a spherical shell of radius @xmath65 .",
    "the equation of state includes radiation pressure , [ eqstate ] p(r)=+at(r)^4p_g+p_rad where @xmath66 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath67 is the atomic mass unit and @xmath68 is the mean atomic weight .",
    "the opacity is obtained from a zero metallicity table from opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) supplemented at low temperatures by opacities from lenzuni et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for @xmath69k .",
    "the further assumption is made that the radiated luminosity of the star @xmath70 is balanced by the rate of energy output by all internal sources , @xmath71 , as described below in  [ ensources ] .",
    "l_*=4r_*^2_bt_eff^4 = l_tot .",
    "[ eq : thermal ] where @xmath72 is the surface temperature , and @xmath73 is the total radius .",
    "starting with a mass @xmath74 and an estimate for the outer radius @xmath75 , the code integrates the structure equations outward from the center",
    ". the total rate of energy production @xmath71 is compared to the stellar radiated luminosity , as in equation ( [ eq : thermal ] ) and the radius is adjusted until the condition of thermal equilibrium is met ( a convergence of @xmath76 in @xmath77 is reached ) .",
    "we now describe the two different mechanisms for supplying the dm density .",
    "_ extended adiabatic contraction : _ as the baryons start to collapse into a protostellar cloud at the center of the dm halo , the dm responds to the changing gravitational potential well and falls in as well . as described in our previous work ( spolyar et al .",
    "2008 ) , we will use adiabatic contraction ( ac ) to describe this increase in dm density . for the case of spherical haloes",
    ", we previously found , by performing exact calculations for comparison ( freese et al .",
    "2009 ) , that the simple blumenthal method ( blumenthal et al . 1985",
    "; barnes & white 1984 ; ryden & gunn 1987 ) gives reliable results for the final dm densities up to an unimportant factor of two ; others confirmed this conclusion ( natarajan et al .",
    "2009 ; iocco et al .",
    "2008 ; sivertsson & gondolo 2010 ) . using this simple approach during the ac phase",
    ", we found that @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the gas density .",
    "these are the values we will use during ac .    in our previous work ,",
    "we probably underestimated the lifetime of the dm inside the star due to ac . in our previous work",
    "we treated the dm halo as spherical and ran up the ds mass to the point where the dm initially inside the star was entirely consumed by annihilation .",
    "the ds mass at this point is @xmath80 after a lifetime of @xmath81 years , and the amount of dm consumed has only amounted to @xmath19 . in a spherical dm halo ,",
    "the orbits of dm particles are planar rosettes ( binney & tremaine 2008 ) conserving energy as well as all three components of angular momentum ; consequently the central hole ( or `` empty loss cone '' ) that results from dm annihilation can not be repopulated once it is depleted .",
    "( note that although dm annihilation creates a central hole in the dm density , the entire region is filled with baryons and hence the potential is stable . )",
    "however , it is well known that dm halos formed in hierarchical structure formation simulations are not spherical but are prolate - triaxial ( bardeen et al . 1986 ; barnes & efsthatiou 1987 ; frenk et al .",
    "1988 ; dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; jing & suto 2002 ; bailin & steinmetz 2005 ; allgood et al . 2006 ) with typical axis ratios of ( short - axis)/(long - axis ) @xmath82 . in triaxial potentials ,",
    "the orbits do not conserve angular momentum .",
    "in particular there are two families of `` centrophilic orbits '' ( box orbits and chaotic orbits ) which oscillate back and forth through the potential and can travel arbitrarily close to the center ( schwarzschild 1979 , goodman & schwarzschild 1981 ; gerhard & binney 1985 ; de zeeuw 1985 ; schwarzschild 1993 ; merritt & fridman 1986 ; merritt & valluri 1996 ) . unlike an orbit in a spherical potential which has a constant pericenter radius ( the distance of closest approach to the center of the potential ) ,",
    "the pericenter radius of a centrophilic orbit varies over time extending from @xmath83 $ ] where @xmath84 is sometimes referred to as the `` throat '' of the orbit ( gerhard & binney 1985 ) .",
    "as any one particle traverses the center of the dark star , it may indeed be removed from the pool by annihilation .",
    "however , it was unlikely to pass through the star ( of radius @xmath85 ) on its next orbit anyhow since in general @xmath86 .",
    "instead , a particle on a different `` centrophilic orbit '' enters the star for the first time maintaining the steady state central dm density cusp . unlike in the case of a spherical dm halo , where annihilation steadily depletes the central density cusp , in a triaxial halo",
    "there is a high probability for a particle on a centrophilic orbit to pass through the center for the first time on any given orbital crossing .",
    "this is particularly true in potentials with central point masses which are dominated by chaotic orbits and are therefore ergodic ( merritt & valluri 1996 ) .",
    "hence , the central dm density can remain much higher than we previously expected .",
    "the dynamics of the refilling of the central `` loss cone '' in the case of spherical and non - spherical collisionless systems has been studied previously in the context of capture of stars by a central black hole ( gerhard & binney 1985 ; magorrian & tremaine 1999 ; merritt & poon 2004 ) .",
    "the details of filling rate for the specific case of the ds will be presented separately in a later paper ; however these previous papers showed that in non spherical systems the loss cone could remain full for a factor of 2 to @xmath77 times longer than in the spherical case depending on whether the potential was axisymmetric ( magorrian & tremaine 1999 ) or triaxial ( merritt & poon 2004 ) , respectively .",
    "since dm halos are known to be triaxial this suggests that the duration for which the central hole remains full ( i.e. has orbits with the low angular momentum necessary for annihilation ) can increase from 300,000 years to as much as @xmath87 yrs possibly allowing the ds to be detectable by jwst .",
    "these more optimistic estimates require that a significant fraction of the orbits in these early dm halos are chaotic and boxlike .",
    "one important potential concern with assuming conditions in a triaxial halo is that several studies have shown that the growth of central baryonic components tend to make dm halos more axisymmetric than in purely dissipationless simulations ( dubinski 1994 , evrard et al .",
    "1994 , merritt & quinlan 1998 , kazantzidis et al .",
    "2004 , debattista et al .",
    "2008 , tissera et al .",
    "2009 ) , and axisymmetric models are generally not expected to contain centrophilic orbit families",
    ". however , valluri et al . (",
    "2010 ) recently showed that when a compact central baryonic component is grown adiabatically inside a triaxial dm halo , the final halo that results from the adiabatic growth of such a baryonic component looks nearly oblate , yet its orbit population can contain a significant fraction of centrophilic orbits , since box orbits preferentially deform their shapes rather than converting to centrophobic tube families .",
    "furthermore they showed that a significant fraction of the orbits ( both box orbits and tube orbits which were traditionally thought to avoid the center ) experience strong chaotic scattering , a mechanism that could drive them close to the center .",
    "they found that for a fixed ratio of the mass of the baryonic component to mass of the dm halo ( @xmath88 ) , the smaller the radius of the baryonic component ( @xmath85 ) , relative to the virial radius of the dm halo ( @xmath89 ) the greater was the fraction of chaotic orbits .",
    "the most compact baryonic component studied by them had @xmath90 , which is significantly larger than that for our fiducial smds for which @xmath91 .",
    "the compactness of the baryonic component in the ds relative to its halo is important since valluri et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that when the central component became very compact , orbits that were previously thought to be immune to becoming chaotic ( the `` long - axis tubes '' which are important in prolate dm halos ) also become chaotic .",
    "valluri & freese ( 2010 ) are currently computing the rate at which the `` loss cone '' at the center of the sdms will be refilled for a range of possible halo and ds masses .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that the initial mass function of the first stars may be determined by the cutoff of the dm supply , which will take place at different smds masses in different haloes , depending on the details of the cosmological merger history .",
    "as the smds mass becomes a significant fraction of the halo mass ( @xmath92% ) , it can significantly affect the shape of the halo , causing it to become more axisymmetric ( merritt & quinlan 1998 ) and thereby potentially cutting off the dm supply ; on the other hand , in the meantime the halo is growing larger due to mergers , which will replenish the population of radial orbits . numerical simulations with better resolution than currently possible will be necessary to address these questions .    in the meantime , in our case without capture , we assume that the required dm is present and allow the stellar mass to grow to the point where most of the baryonic content of the initial halo is inside a single smds .    the amount of dark matter required inside the star to sustain long enough dm heating to reach a @xmath28 smds is still small , @xmath93 for accretion rate @xmath94/yr and @xmath95 for accretion rate @xmath96/yr , out of a total @xmath97 halo . in the code we accomplish this by not removing annihilated dm from the pool .",
    "more precise studies must be performed later in which we follow individual particle orbits in triaxial potentials to better determine the precise dm density at any one time .    _",
    "extended capture : _ in our model labeled `` with capture '' , we assume ( as in our previous papers ) that the dm due to adiabatic contraction runs out in @xmath98 yrs . for a while dm heating becomes unimportant and the ds has to contract to maintain pressure support .",
    "then ds is refueled in the later stages due to capture of further dm from the ambient medium .",
    "this refueling requires an additional piece of particle physics : scattering of dm off the nuclei inside the star .",
    "some of the wimps from the ambient medium that have orbits passing through the star will eventually be captured and sink to the center , where they can annihilate efficiently .",
    "the capture process is irrelevant during the early evolutionary stage of the ds , since the baryon density is not high enough at that point , leading to very small scattering probabilities .",
    "however , once the ds approaches the main sequence , the baryon densities become high enough for substantial capture to be possible .",
    "this mechanism was first noticed by freese et al .",
    "( 2008b ) and iocco ( 2008 ) .    in our previous work ( spolyar et al .",
    "2009 ) we investigated a minimal capture case which did not cause the ds to grow much more massive than the original case without capture @xmath26 ; but we stated our intention to work out the case of a more substantial background dm density in which case the ds would end up supermassive .",
    "this is what we investigate here .",
    "the capture rate is sensitive to the product of two uncertain quantities : the scattering cross section of wimp interactions with the nuclei @xmath99 and the ambient dm density @xmath100 . since the capture mechanism depends only on the product of these two quantities , one can interchangeably vary either of these .",
    "for illustration purposes we will fix @xmath101 and vary @xmath102 .",
    "the latter quantity is the largest reasonable amount based on our results for ac at the ds surface ; and the former is the `` minimal capture '' value considered in all our previous papers .",
    "our fiducial cross section is just below the experimental bound for spin - dependent ( sd ) scattering ; the bound on spin - independent ( si ) scattering is much tighter : @xmath103  cm@xmath4 for @xmath105gev ( ahmed et al .",
    "we will show that capture can produce sufficient dm in the star to keep dm heating alive for a long time .",
    "the details of our procedure for including capture have previously been presented in spolyar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and will not be repeated here .",

    "( 2009 ) . as the ds contracts , the density and temperature increase to the point where nuclear fusion begins .",

    "for example , by using the temperature appropriate to dark stars with extended ac ( @xmath126k ) rather than the much higher central temperature ( @xmath127k ) appropriate to nuclear power generation , the above relations show that ds have much larger radii and smaller surface temperatures than fusion powered stars .",
    "we wish to draw particular attention to the fact that luminosity scales linearly with stellar mass , and is independent of power source .",
    "figure 2 plots the h - r diagram `` with capture '' for a single wimp mass of 100 gev , for @xmath112/yr , and for @xmath128cm@xmath4 , but for a variety of ambient densities ranging from @xmath129gev @xmath17 .",
    "the latter is the density one finds due to adiabatic contraction at the photosphere of the ds , and seems the largest sensible starting point for the value of the ambient density . our previous paper ( spolyar et al .",
    "2009 ) considered the case of minimal capture with @xmath130gev / cm@xmath5 , which was artificially chosen so that the growth of the ds ceases at 680@xmath110 , the radius shrinks , and then fusion and dm heating play equal roles . for ambient densities below @xmath131gev / cm@xmath5 , the ds mass growth shuts off",
    "well before the star becomes supermassive for the following reason .",
    "the cases with capture all take place at higher stellar densities than the cases without ; the density must be high enough to be able to capture wimps .",
    "consequently the surface temperature is larger and accretion is shut off more easily by radiation coming from the star .",
    "the case of ambient density @xmath130gev / cm@xmath5 ( from our previous paper ) is a very carefully chosen ( delicate ) situation . on the low side of this density ,",
    "dm heating is completely irrelevant and fusion tells the whole story ; on the other hand , for any density @xmath132 gev / cm@xmath5 , dm heating is so dominant over fusion that the ds can just continue growing in mass . at these higher densities",
    "the surface temperature never becomes hot enough ( @xmath133 k ) for feedback effects from the star to cut off accretion . between 50,000 k and 100,000 k feedback effects",
    "are included , and they act to reduce the accretion rate , but they never shut it off entirely for densities above @xmath134gev / cm@xmath5 . in reality a star that is moving around can sometimes hit pockets of high @xmath100 ( where it is dm powered and grows in mass ) and sometimes hit pockets of low @xmath100 ( where fusion takes over ) .",
    "as long as the ambient density remains at least this large , the star can reach arbitrarily large masses and eat the entire baryonic content of the halo .    as described previously",
    ", the capture mechanism depends on the product of scattering cross section times ambient density , @xmath135 , rather than on either of these quantities separately .",
    "hence our current discussion could trade off ambient density vs. cross section .",
    "for example , the product is the same for @xmath136 gev / cm@xmath5 and @xmath137 cm@xmath4 as it is for @xmath138gev / cm@xmath5 and @xmath139 cm@xmath4 .",
    "thus , for the highest reasonable ambient density , the scattering cross section can be several orders of magnitude lower than the experimental upper bound for spin - dependent ( sd ) scattering and still provide substantial capture in ds . while the required @xmath99 is ruled out ( ahmed et al .",
    "2009 ) for si scattering at @xmath105gev , it is below the bounds at low masses @xmath140 gev and in this case can lead to significant dm capture in the stars .    above @xmath141",
    ", one can see that the stellar luminosity scales as @xmath47 and is the same for all models for a given stellar mass ; this statement is essentially true for all stars no matter the power source .",
    "the reason is that at these masses , the star is essentially radiation pressure supported throughout case without capture , where the star is still only 78% radiation pressure supported with the remaining pressure due to gas .",
    "] . this same scaling in supermassive stars was already noticed by hoyle and fowler ( 1963 ) .",
    "the luminosity essentially tracks ( just below ) the eddington luminosity which scales as @xmath142 .",
    "the curves with higher values of wimp mass @xmath35 lie to the left of the curves with lower @xmath35 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the dm heating rate in eqn.(1 ) scales as @xmath143 . hence to reach the same amount of heating and achieve the same luminosity , at higher @xmath35 the ds must be at higher wimp density , i.e. , the stellar radius must be smaller , the ds is hotter , and the corresponding surface temperature @xmath72 is higher . also , for higher @xmath35 the amount of dm in the star is smaller since the star is more compact for the same number of baryons but @xmath144 where @xmath61 is the hydrogen density .",
    "tables 1 and 2 show various stellar properties for a ds that forms in a @xmath29 dm halo , as the star evolves to higher mass for the case of @xmath145 gev , for the two cases `` without '' and `` with '' capture respectively . while the dm density is a gently decreasing function of radius for the case without capture , it is extremely sharply peaked at the center of the ds for the case `` with capture '' .",
    "one can see that , in the case `` without capture '' , @xmath146 of dark matter must be annihilated away in order for the ds to reach @xmath147 for accretion rate @xmath112 .",
    "the time to reach this mass is @xmath106 100myr . for an alternative faster accretion rate @xmath94 , a smaller amount of dm",
    "must be annihilated away , @xmath93 ; then it takes the ds @xmath106 10 myr to reach @xmath148 .",
    "the caveat is that the dm orbits must continue to penetrate into the middle of the ds for this length of time in order for the dm abundance and consequent heating to continue ; it is the dm heat source that keeps the ds cool enough to allow it to continue to accrete baryons .",
    "additionally , the assumption that baryons continue to accrete onto the ds must continue to hold . yet , in the time frame required , the original @xmath97 halo will merge with its neighbors , so that both the baryon and dm densities are disturbed .",
    "these mergers could effect the ds in one of two ways : either they provide more baryons and dm to feed the smds so that it ends up being even larger , or they disrupt the pleasant high dm environment of the smds so that it loses its fuel and converts to an entirely fusion powered star",
    ". continued growth of the ds is quite plausible since simulations with massive bhs in mergers show that they prefer to sit close to the center of the density distribution or find the center in a short time after the merger .",
    "someday detailed cosmological simulations will be required to answer this question .",
    "individual ds in different haloes may end up with a variety of different masses depending on the details of the evolution of the haloes they live in .",
    "the case studied in this paper is clearly a simplistic version of the more complicated reality , but illustrates the basic idea that supermassive stars may be created by accretion onto ds , either with or without capture .    [",

    "they are radiation - pressure dominated with adiabatic index close to @xmath149 , the value that yields neutral stability to radial pulsations for newtonian bodies with no rotation .",
    "indeed general relativistic corrections ( which scale as @xmath150 ) act in the direction of destabilizing stars and are particularly important for high mass stars . fowler ( 1966 ) examined the stability of supermassive stars using polytropes with @xmath62 ( see wagoner 1969 for a review ) .",
    "fowler found that , for the case of no rotation , radial oscillations become dynamically unstable and prevent standard stars more massive than @xmath147 from reaching a phase of hydrogen burning before collapse .",
    "yet he also found that a small amount of rotation can stabilize the stars , so that rotating stars as heavy as @xmath31 could be stable en route to reaching hydrogen burning .    in the case of ds ,",

    "dm orbits are quite complex and the dm in the core is harder to deplete than previously estimated .",

    "future work will be required to accurately obtain wimp orbits , densities , and timescales ( work in progress ) .",

    "a proper study of the final mass of the ds and resultant bh will depend on cosmological simulations .",
