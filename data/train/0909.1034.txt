    "in this paper we investigate the one - dimensional schrdinger operators with the coefficients having singular support on a disjoint set of points .",

    "such point interaction models are _ solvable _ in the sense that the resolvents of corresponding operators can be given explicitly . as a consequence",
    "the spectrum and scattering quantities can also be determined explicitly .",
    "the main question here is how to interpret the differential operators with coefficients equal to the generalized functions since space of distributions @xmath7 is not an algebra with respect to the `` pointwise '' multiplication .",
    "generally the problem of choosing a single hamiltonian corresponding to a particular singular point interaction is complicated enough .",
    "the theory of one - dimensional schrdinger operators with singular potentials has been summarized in research monographs @xcite .    according to the postulates of quantum mechanics every physically measurable quantity",
    "is specified by a _",
    "selfadjoint _ operator in a hilbert space .",
    "starting with the pioneering work of f. berezin and l. faddeev @xcite , the singular point interactions have been studied with the help of the selfadjoint extensions theory for symmetric operators . as a rule ,",
    "the symmetric operators in physical models are generated by differential operators .",
    "this leads to the question how to describe all selfadjoint extensions in terms of the boundary value conditions . in the case of ordinary differential operators",
    "the problem has been solved by m.  krein @xcite .    for partial differential operators",
    "the problem becomes more complicated by the infinite deficiency indices of symmetric operators . in that case",
    "new approach to the theory of selfadjoint extensions is based on the concept of boundary triples @xcite and the corresponding weyl functions . in @xcite",
    "the concept of weyl function was generalized to an arbitrary symmetric operator with infinite deficiency indices .",
    "it is well known that the weyl function can be used to investigate the spectrum of a selfadjoint extension and the scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the concept of boundary triples is useful in the investigation of the point interaction models @xcite .",
    "the singular finite rank perturbations have been studied in papers @xcite and monograph @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger operators with different singular potentials have been investigated in @xcite .    in some instances",
    "the set of all selfadjoint extensions of a symmetric operators is rich enough .",
    "therefore the harder question comes : how to choose an extension that is best suited to our physical model .",
    "for some models the proper operator can not be chosen within the selfadjoint extensions theory , because the models contain hidden parameters .",
    "if we replace the singular potential with a sequence of short - range smooth potentials , then the operator obtained in the zero - range limit , as often happens , can depend on the type of regularization , that is to say , the operator is governed by the profile of squeezed potentials .",
    "this profile is a hidden parameter and plays a crucial role in the choice of a selfadjoint extension corresponding to the physical model under consideration .",
    "differential operators with singular coefficients can be studied within the framework of the contemporary theories such as the colombeau algebras @xcite or the egorov generalized function algebra @xcite .",
    "these theories allow us not only to multiply the generalized functions , but they also contain rich sets of `` @xmath8-functions with fixed profiles '' as different elements of the algebra .",
