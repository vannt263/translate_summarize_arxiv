    "recently , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) power correction has been shown an important role in understanding the exclusive processes @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite . the method for calculating the nlo power correction",
    "is called the collinear expansion @xcite .",
    "this power expansion method is compatible with pqcd factorization @xcite , which demonstrates the amplitude as convolutions of perturbatively calculable hard scattering amplitudes ( the hard function ) and nonperturbative hadronic wave functions ( the soft function ) .",
    "furthermore , it is a feynman diagram approach such that the partonic interpretation for the nlo power correction can be preserved .",
    "the asymptotic limit of the @xmath13 transition form factor to be @xmath14 with @xmath15 mev , is about @xmath16 higher than the upper end of the cleo data @xcite .",
    "this deviation can be successfully explained by nlo power correction .",
    "in addition , nlo power correction can well describe the low energy portion of the cleo data .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to generalize the approach for the @xmath13 form factor to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 form factors .",
    "the first problem we shall face is that there are many independent degrees of freedom associated with the @xmath17 and @xmath18 lowest valence fock states .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons are admixtures of the @xmath19 octet and singlet states , this counts eight quantities : four wave functions and four related decay constants .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons can also receive contributions from the @xmath20 anomaly to have intrinsic heavy quark and gluon contents . to reduce the number of independent degrees of freedom , we invoke phenomenological constraints and physical assumptions over the wave functions and decay constants .    for the phenomenological constraints",
    ", we shall employ the large momentum transfer data for @xmath1 and @xmath21 transition form factor @xcite , the two - photon decay widths of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons and the ratio @xmath22 of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 decay widths .",
    "as for the physical assumptions we shall invoke the @xmath19 octet - singlet mixing scheme . in this mixing scheme , both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are linear combinations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the octet and singlet states in the @xmath19 representation .",
    "the mixing is controlled by the mixing angle . in the one mixing angle scheme , in which the octet and singlet meson states have different decay constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 and share a common mixing angle @xmath29 , the mixing angle @xmath30 is in range of @xmath31 @xcite . in recent years , many evidences @xcite have indicated that a two mixing angle scheme , in which the octet and singlet mixing angles @xmath32 and @xmath33 can take different values , is more general than the one mixing angle scheme .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 form factors have been investigated by either one mixing angle scheme @xcite or two mixing angle scheme@xcite .",

    ", we shall investigate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 form factors and the mixing pattern of @xmath3 system by employing pqcd formula with nlo power correction in the standard hard scattering approach .",

    "our strategy in calculating the power corrections to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 meson - photon transition form factor is to invoke the collinear expansion @xcite . for simplicity",

    "we assign the loop momentum @xmath48 for the valence antiquark and let it flow into the hard function . the hard function @xmath49 contains two parton photon interaction vertices and one virtual internal parton propagator .",
    "the amplitude @xmath50 contains leading , next - to - leading and higher twist contributions .",
    "the quantity twist is understood as an effective twist for nonlocal operators and is not exactly the same with the usual twist defined for local operators .",

    ", the experimental errors are shared for high and low energy data . because the @xmath5 distribution can only measure the correlations between the mixing parameters , the hope for constraining each parameters in a independent way",
    "can not be obtained and only partial restrictions over the correlations of the parameters can be derived .",
    "this can be seen from figs .",
    "8 , in which the @xmath202 parameter is not contrained in a reasonable way . to compensate this flaw",
    ", we note that the @xmath5 distribution of the data set ii can intersect with that @xmath5 distribution of the data set i. the intersections between two @xmath5 distributions can give better constraints on parameters than the data set i or ii .",
    "one should note that although the data set ii is a subset of the data set i , the @xmath5 distribution of the data set ii is not necessary to be a subset of the @xmath5 distribution of the data set i , since the effects of correlations between the parameters are different for two data sets . from the overlapped regions of the data set i and ii in @xmath177 error , we may extract from figs .",
    "8 and 9 the allowable regions for the mixing parameters . in fig .",
    "8 , we plot the possible allowable ranges for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . it can be observed from fig .",
    "8 that the overlapped region for @xmath27 and @xmath28 is quite stringent : @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "figure 9 shows the allowable region for @xmath205 and @xmath32 from both data set i and set ii .",
    "the overlapped region indicates that : @xmath206 and @xmath207 .    combining figs .",
    "8 and 9 , we may derive the @xmath208 limits of the scaled @xmath1 and @xmath2 form factors q^2f_(q^2)|_q^2= [ f__8_8 - 2f__1_1]=(18946 )  , q^2f_^(q^2)|_q^2= [ f__8_8 + 2f__1_1]=(29535 )  .",
    "the error in the scaled @xmath1 form factor being larger than that of the scaled @xmath2 form factor is due to the fact that the errors in the data for @xmath1 and @xmath2 form factors are shared in our analysis .",
    "this is consistent with the concept of @xmath3 mixing .",
    "we have shown that the collinear expansion for @xmath209 can be systematically performed in compatibility with pqcd factorization .",
    "the @xmath34 power corrections for @xmath194 and @xmath192 have been evaluated .",
    "the magnitudes of nlo power corrections are determined .",
    "we have made a general analysis for the allowed values for the mixing parameters by combining the high and low energy data .",
    "except of @xmath27 , the other three parameters @xmath210 can be constrained in a reasonable region .",
    "the large error for the fit @xmath27 is mainly from the experimental error and can be improved by future experiment with higher accuracy . at present",
    ", we would invoke the chiral perturbation theory calculation for @xmath27 .",
    "we have also shown that the intrinsic charm content of @xmath18 meson has little contributions .",
    "any sizable contribution from the intrinsic charm would lead to large @xmath5 value as shown in fig .",
    "7 . of course",
    ", there require further investigations for this point , if more accurate form factors data are available .",
    "so far , we have not considered the finite meson mass effects for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 form factors . at first glance",
    ", the meson mass effects can not be safely ignored . because the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 meson masses are large as @xmath211 mev and @xmath212 mev , power corrections from the mass effects of order @xmath213 and @xmath214 are also important .",
    "the type of corrections @xmath213 are kinematics .",
    "this is similar to the nachtmann s correction for deep inelastic scattering @xcite and can be negligible .",
    "the second type of corrections @xmath214 are dynamics and can be argued that they are of twist-6 , at least .",
    "this is because the associated spin projector is @xmath215 ( cf . the leading spin projector @xmath216 ) , which will introduce two additional @xmath217 propagators into the related hard function . as a result ,",
    "the dynamical type meson mass corrections are of order @xmath218 .",
    "of course , a complete analysis for these meson mass effects is important .",
