    "since the discovery of magnetic field expulsion from superconductors , commonly known as meissner effect , by meissner and ochsenfeld in 1933 @xcite , the solutions of maxwell equations for a superconductor in the presence of external fields have been analyzed in numerous occasions for different geometries @xcite . while most of these studies are focused on static external magnetic fields , the interaction between superconductors and time - dependent electromagnetic fields remains unexplored in depth in the scientific literature .",
    "in this paper we try to change this situation by solving the problem of a standing wave scattered by an infinite cylindrical superconductor .",
    "the problem is addressed by starting from the time - dependent maxwell equation for the source - free case ( wave equation ) outside the superconducting region . for a standing wave ,",
    "the space and time components of the wave equation solution are independent , reducing it to the helmholtz and simple harmonic motion equations .",
    "finally , a linear combination of cylindrical bessel functions ( general solutions of the helmholtz equation ) is presented as the final solution of the problem respecting the boundary conditions at infinity and at the superconductor surface .",
    "the main difficulties in problems like this may arise from the symmetries of the system and boundary condition problem .",
    "unlike the cylindrical case where the cylindrical symmetry simplifies the problem , in other geometries such as the spherical , the problem becomes non - trivial .    to the best of our knowledge , the only extensive study related to the subject in the linear domain was performed by nye in 2003 @xcite where a detailed analysis of the scattering of plane electromagnetic waves by perfectly conducting regions is presented .",
    "the results are consistent with ours",
    ". other works addressing the interaction between electromagnetic waves and nonlinear superconducting materials have been presented mainly within the microwave community .",
    "a complete study with numerical computations can be found in @xcite .",
    "consider an infinite cylindrical superconductor with radius @xmath1 in the presence of a plane standing electromagnetic wave and that the cylinder axis coincides with the z - axis ( see figure [ cylinder ] ) .",
    "the maxwell equation : @xmath2 in the source - free case and assuming the relations @xmath3 and @xmath4 , becomes : @xmath5 which can be simplified by taking the lorentz gauge ( @xmath6 ) : @xmath7 the wave equation .",
    "if the electromagnetic wave propagates from infinity in the x - axis direction with the electric field pointing in the direction of the cylinder axis , the z - axis component of the vector potential @xmath8 is the only relevant component needed to compute the electromagnetic field : @xmath9 as the superconducting cylinder is in the presence of a plane standing electromagnetic wave , the component @xmath10 in cylindrical coordinates ( since the cylinder is infinite there are no dependence on the z - coordinate ) can be separated into : @xmath11 , a space - like function @xmath12 and a time - like function @xmath13 .",
    "this separation of variables gives rise to two equations : @xmath14 and @xmath15 the helmholtz equation [ helmholtz ] and the simple harmonic motion equation [ shm ] .",
    "therefore , the most general solution for @xmath16 is : @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\                            & \\times                       & [ c_mj_m(kr)+d_my_m(kr ) ] \\nonumber \\\\                            & \\times                       & [ e\\cos(\\omega t ) + f\\sin(\\omega t ) ] .",

    "the superconducting cylinder is considered to be of type i with zero penetration length , a reasonable approximation if the cylinder radius is much larger than the penetration length .",
    "the magnetic field is expelled from the superconducting region by the surface current @xmath22 defined in the coupling equation between the superconductor and the magnetic field : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the unitary vector orthogonal to the superconductor surface and @xmath25 is the magnetic field in the outer region of the superconductor surface . as the magnetic field and",
    "currents are zero inside the superconducting cylinder , the component @xmath10 must be constant inside ( set to zero for convenience ) . as there can not be any angular dependencies on the surface of the cylinder , then @xmath26 and : @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\                            & \\times                       & [ c_mj_m(kr)-c_m\\frac{j_m(kr)}{y_m(kr)}y_m(kr ) ] \\nonumber \\\\                            & \\times                       & [ e\\cos(\\omega t)+f\\sin(\\omega t ) ] .",

    "therefore the final solution reads for @xmath16 : @xmath32 ,   \\label{final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "such a mathematical result is hard to interpret and visualize but possible to represent with enough accuracy through numerical computations up to @xmath35 .",
    "the spatial representation and analysis of @xmath10 for different wavelengths are presented in the following section .",
    "the numerical computations that simulate the scattering were performed in a 2d array representing the cross - section of the superconducting cylinder ( centered at the origin ) in the x - y plane ranging from minus 40 to 40 in steps of 0.1 radius units for both @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions at the instant @xmath38 .",
    "the simulation of the plane standing wave scattering by the superconducting cylinder is shown in figure [ planewave ] in arbitrary units for @xmath39 ( top ) and @xmath40 ( bottom ) .",
    "for @xmath39 the scattering presents a diffraction pattern of nodes and anti - nodes around the superconducting cylinder while converging to the plane wave at large distances .",
    "the scattering effects are perhaps more visible for @xmath40 , the nodes and anti - nodes around the cylinder are clearly amplified and separated by roughly the wavelength .",
    "the nodes and anti - nodes are maximal near the superconductor and decrease gradually with distance .",

    "according to maxwell equations , the interaction between a plane wave and a superconductor gives rise to a diffraction pattern .",
    "we would like to challenge experimental groups to test the result obtained in this paper even though we are aware of some technical limitations that may constrain the observations .",
    "for example , a difficulty may come from generating a large enough controlled plane standing wave with a wavelength of the same order of magnitude as the superconductor radius to enhance the scattering .",
    "also , it is important to stress that the wave period must be much larger than the superconductor relaxation time so that it can respond instantly to field variations ."
