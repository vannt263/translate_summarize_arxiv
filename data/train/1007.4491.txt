    "two of the best known generalizations of the bose and fermi statistics are the gentile s statistics ( gs ) @xcite and the fractional exclusion statistics ( fes ) @xcite .",
    "a method for the stochastic simulation of the time evolution of bose and fermi gases was proposed by guastella _",
    ". @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a method for the simulation of the more general gs and fes systems , which have as limit cases the fermi and bose statistics . as we shall see below",
    ", the gs and the fes are apparently closely related .",
    "nevertheless they give totally different thermodynamic results .",
    "the gs describes systems of non - interacting particles in which each single particle state can be occupied by a maximum of @xmath0 particles ; the case @xmath1 corresponds to the fermi statistics and the case @xmath2 corresponds to the bose statistics .",
    "the definition of fes is somewhat more complicated .",
    "a fes system is formed in general of several subsystems , called _",
    "species_. each species consists of a finite number of particles in a finite dimensional space , spanned by a set of single - particle quantum numbers .",
    "they are defined by coarse - graining the set of single - particle quantum numbers for each type of particles in the system .",
    "each species has a certain number of available single - particle states which may depend , in principle , on the number of particles in any of the species of the system .",
    "this dependence is known as the `` statistical interaction '' between the fes particles and limits the number of particles that can be accommodated in each species , similarly as in the gs .",
    "let us number the species by @xmath3 and denote by @xmath4 and @xmath5 the number of particles and the number of available single - particle states of species @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the statistical interaction is expressed by the change in the number of available single - particle states at the change of the particle numbers .",
    "for example a change @xmath7 of @xmath4 will change @xmath8 by @xmath9 , for any @xmath10 .",
    "the fes parameters , @xmath11 , depend on the way the system is divided into species  different divisions lead to different @xmath12 s @xcite . for non - interacting bosons and fermions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , for any @xmath6 and @xmath10 .    now",
    "the connection between gs and fes is obvious .",
    "if we would have two similar types of systems , one described by gs , of parameter @xmath0 , and the other one described by fes , of parameters @xmath15 , we may coarse - grain the sets of quantum numbers that describe these systems and obtain the `` species '' @xmath3 , each with @xmath4 particles and @xmath5 available states . if we denote by @xmath16 the number of available states when @xmath17 , for any @xmath6 , then the maximum number of particles that we can put into the species @xmath6 in both gases is the same , namely @xmath18 .",
    "based on this single observation we could say that gs is pure fes with species formed of single - particle states .",
    "nevertheless , the thermodynamics of fes and gs systems are different . in general",
    ", fes is applied to species of large numbers of particles and states and can not be applied to single states , like gs . if one would attempt to make the fes species smaller and smaller , not only that the thermodynamic results deviate from those obtained with large species , as we shall show below , but the very definition of fes becomes unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "if we apply both , fes and gs to particle species  say we have the species @xmath19the number of microconfigurations in which the particles can arrange themselves is not the same in fes @xcite and gs @xcite systems .",
    "therefore the thermodynamic results must be different .",
    "the difference between the fes and the gs is very clearly evidenced in systems of constant density of states ( dos ) .",
    "it is well known that bose , fermi and , in general , fes systems of constant dos are thermodynamically equivalent , i.e. the specific heat and entropy are independent of the statistics @xcite .",
    "the microscopic reason of this equivalence lies in the fact that one can realize a one - to - one mapping between microconfigurations of particles of the same excitation energies across all statistics  by the `` excitation energy '' of a microconfiguration we mean the difference between the energy of the microconfiguration and the lowest energy of the system @xcite . as we shall see in the following",
    ", the gs does not fall into this equivalence class . for a gs of constant dos ,",
    "the specific heat , and therefore also the entropy , depend on the parameter @xmath0 .    as stated above ,",
    "we propose in this paper a method to stochastically simulate the time evolution of gs and fes systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "for the clarity of the exposition , we start in section [ bfgas ] by briefly reviewing the method of guastella _",
    "et al._. then we extend the method to the fes and gs gases in section 3 .",
    "finally , in section 4 the derived transition probabilities associated with the markov chain that we introduce are used in simulations of fes and gs systems , the results are tested against corresponding analytical data and particularities of the two statistics are commented upon .",
    "let us consider a system of ideal bosons or fermions in contact with a heat bath , at temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the single particle states of the system , denoted by @xmath21 , have the energies @xmath22 ( @xmath3 ) ; the energy levels may be degenerated .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described in terms of a time dependent markov chain in the microconfiguration space .",
    "each microconfiguration is a set @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the particle population of the state @xmath21 . for fluency we shall call the microconfigurations simply _ states _ , which must not be confused with the single - particle states .",
    "the system evolves in time from one state to another _ neighboring _ state by random jumps of particles between the single - particle states .",
    "the transition rates between two states will be denoted by @xmath25 , where the notation convention is that the first subscript refers to the final state and the second subscript refers to the initial state . assuming that in the dynamics of the system the particles jump between single particle states one at a time , we shall consider that two states are neighbors if they differ by the exchange of only one particle between two single particle states .",
    "therefore , we shall use the simpler notation @xmath26 to refer to the transition rate of a particle from the state @xmath21 , of @xmath24 particles , to the state @xmath27 , of @xmath28 particles .",
    "if the particles are bosons , the fermi golden rule imposes in general that @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath29 . for fermions ,",
    "the pauli exclusion principle gives a transition rate @xmath30 , since each state can accommodate no more than one particle .",
    "as the system is in contact with a thermostat , the _ relative _ transition rate , @xmath31 , must also be proportional to a weight factor , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 . after setting - up the initial microconfiguration , the simulation proceeds by allowing the particles to make random jumps between the single - particle states , with probabilities proportional to the transition rates . in what follows",
    "we shall denote by @xmath34 the probability to find the system in the microconfiguration @xmath35 .",
    "then the mean occupation of a single particle state is @xmath36 after the system is simulated long enough , the equilibrium is reached and the ensemble averages of the thermodynamic quantities do not change in time anymore .",
    "once this condition is reached , the equilibrium probabilities , @xmath37 , satisfy the detailed balance equation ( dbe ) , @xmath38 for any neighboring states , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the system is in contact with a heat bath , the equilibrium probabilities should be the canonical probabilities , @xmath41}/z(t , n ) , \\label{pcan}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the canonical partition function",
    ".    the dbe can be easily checked .",
    "if we plug the expression ( [ pcan ] ) into ( [ dbe1 ] ) , with @xmath43 , we obtain an identity .",
    "therefore the procedure described above produces the canonical probabilities when equilibrium is reached .",
    "the calculation of the transition rates in fes systems is not as straightforward as in the bose and fermi gases . a fes system is essentially an interacting particle system , described by a ( countable ) set of `` quasiparticle '' quantum numbers , @xmath44 , where @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "for example 1d integrable quantum gases of interacting bosons and fermions @xcite and systems described by the fermi liquid model @xcite are typical fes systems . for the 1d integrable quantum gases the quantum numbers are the asymptotic momenta , @xmath45 , whereas for the fermi liquid systems the `` quasiparticle '' energies , @xmath46 ,",
    "are used as quantum numbers .",
    "the population of the `` quasiparticle '' states will be denoted by @xmath24 or @xmath47 .",
    "the particles are interacting and therefore the values of the quantum numbers may depend ( in principle ) on the whole set @xmath23 , which defines also the quantum state of the system .    to show how the dependence of @xmath44 on @xmath48 leads to fes ( see also @xcite for more details ) , let us assume that the allowed values of @xmath44 , @xmath49 , form a set of points in a @xmath50-dimensional ( @xmath50d ) vector space . to build a statistical description of the system",
    ", we have to calculate the number of configurations in which the particles can occupy different one - particle states at constant total energy @xmath51 and particle number @xmath52 . for this",
    ", we divide the @xmath50d space of @xmath53 vectors into elementary , fixed volumes , @xmath54 , each containing @xmath5 states and @xmath4 particles  these are our species and should be made no confusion from using the same subscripts , @xmath55 , etc . for counting both , the states , @xmath56 , and the species , @xmath57 .",
    "if the particles in the system are bosons , @xmath24 may take any positive integer value and the number of microconfigurations we have in the system for this division into species is [ n_microc ] @xmath58 if the particles are fermions , @xmath59 or 1 and the total number of microconfigurations is @xmath60    since in our system the values @xmath61 change with the particle populations , @xmath35 , while the elementary volumes , @xmath54 , are fixed in the @xmath53 space , this leads to a dependence of the @xmath5 s on the set @xmath62 @xcite .    to quantify this statement , let us assume that a small change , @xmath7 , of @xmath4 produces a linear change , @xmath63 of the number of states , @xmath8 , for any @xmath6 and @xmath10 ( not all the @xmath12 s have to be different from zero ) .",
    "the proportionality constants , @xmath11 , are the fes parameters defined in the introduction .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ n_microc ] ) and ( [ deltagj ] ) we can calculate the grandcanonical partition function , @xmath64 where we assumed that the total energy of the system is @xmath65 .",

    "to all the particles in a species . in eq .",
    "( [ cz1 ] ) @xmath66 stands for @xmath67 or @xmath68 , depending on whether we have bosons or fermions in the system . using eq .",
    "( [ cz1 ] ) we can calculate the equilibrium properties of the system by maximizing @xmath69 with respect to the set @xmath70 @xcite . in this way we obtain for bosons and fermions the systems of equations [ eqplesdistr ] @xmath71 @xmath72 respectively , where @xmath73 .",
    "one should note that in both eqs .",
    "( [ nbose ] ) and ( [ nfermi ] ) @xmath74 corresponds to non - interacting bosonic and fermionic systems , respectively .    to calculate the transition rates",
    ", we have to consider separately the systems of bosons and the systems of fermions ; we shall be interested in transitions in which a particle jumps from one species to another , therefore changing the particle distribution over the species .",
    "let s consider the jump of one particle from the species @xmath6 into the species @xmath10 and vice - versa , in a system of bosons .",
    "for the jump @xmath75 , we start from a configuration of @xmath4 particles and @xmath5 available states in species @xmath6 and arrive into a configuration of @xmath76 particles and @xmath8 states in the species @xmath10 .",
    "the reversed process , @xmath77 , is exactly like @xmath75 , but in reverse order , i.e. we start from a configuration of @xmath76 particles and @xmath8 states in the species @xmath10 and arrive in a configuration of @xmath4 particles and @xmath5 states in the species @xmath6 .",
    "let s now focus on the process @xmath75 and assume that the @xmath4 particles are distributed as @xmath78 onto the states with the quantum numbers @xmath79 .",
    "analogously , the @xmath80 particles that exist in the species @xmath10 before the jump , are distributed as @xmath81 particles on the states @xmath82 . keeping the notations from section [ bfgas ]",
    ", we have the transition rates @xmath83",
    ". therefore the transition rate of a particle  any particle  from the species @xmath6 to the state @xmath84 of species @xmath10 is @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the transition of a particle from the species @xmath6 onto any state of the species @xmath10 can be found by summing - up over all the @xmath8 states of the species @xmath10 , leading to @xmath86 .",
    "further , to obtain the total transition rate from the species @xmath6 to the species @xmath10 , we have to multiply the above result with the number of microconfigurations , @xmath87 \\times ( g_i+n_i-1)!/[n_i!(g_i-1)!]$ ] .",
    "in this way we finally obtain , up to a common multiplicative factor and the canonical weight , @xmath88 , @xmath89 the dbe then reads , @xmath90}t_{b , ji}(n_j-1,n_i ) e^{\\beta(\\epsilon_i-\\epsilon_j ) } = e^{-\\beta[(n_i-1)\\epsilon_i+n_j\\epsilon_j]}t_{b , ij}(n_i-1,n_j )   \\label{bdefesb}\\ ] ] which , by using eq . ( [ tbji ] ) , it can be immediately checked to be an identity .",
    "a similar argument can be used for transitions in systems of fermions , with the difference that the particles can not arrive on a quantum state already occupied .",
    "this leads to a transition rate @xmath91 . multiplying again by the number of microconfigurations , we obtain @xmath92 like in the bose systems , the transition rates ( [ tfji ] ) satisfy identically the dbe",
    ".      in gs each single - particle state can be occupied by up to @xmath0 particles .",
    "this can be described in a second quantized theory by introducing the creation and annihilation operators @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , of the form @xcite @xmath95 the creation and annihilation operators are assumed to commute for different @xmath53 s .",
    "if we denote by @xmath96 the vacuum state , then a many - body state of @xmath97 particles is @xmath98 .",
    "as the system is connected to a heat bath , the eigenstates of the free gs particle system are perturbed by external interactions .",
    "the transition rate of a particle from the state @xmath56 to the state @xmath99 , @xmath100 , caused by this interaction should be proportional to @xmath101 . using ( [ defaags ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath102 , like in the case of bosons , with the extra condition that @xmath103 if @xmath104 .",

    "these differences are reflected in the thermodynamic properties of gs and fes systems , a fact which is particularly obvious in systems with constant density of states .",
    "a transition rate between different species in gs would be rather difficult to write , since it depends on how many states in the target species are fully occupied . therefore for gs systems we shall consider just transitions from one state to another , as discussed in the beginning of this section .",
