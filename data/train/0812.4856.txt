    "<S> we consider a connection between the holographic dark energy density and the kinetic k - essence energy density in a flat frw universe . with the choice @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the holographic dark energy can be described by a kinetic k - essence scalar field in a certain way . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show this kinetic k - essential description of the holographic dark energy with @xmath0 and reconstruct the kinetic k - essence function @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a strong belief that the universe is undergoing an epoch of accelerated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> recent cosmological observations from type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) [ 1 ] , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measured with the wmap satellite [ 2 ] , large scale structure [ 3 ] , weak lensing [ 4 ] and the integrated sach - wolfe effect [ 5 ] provide an overwhelming evidence in favour of a present accelerating universe . within the framework of the standard friedman - robertson - walker cosmology , this present acceleration requires the existence of a negative pressure fluid , dubbed dark energy , whose pressure @xmath2 and density @xmath3 satisfy @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> unsurprisingly , the unknown nature and origin of dark energy has become a fundamental problem in theoretical physics and observational cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant ( or vacuum energy ) is the most obvious candidate to address this issue as it complies well with the cosmological tests at our disposal . </S>",
    "<S> however , the well known problem of the cosmological constant and the coincidence problem [ 6 ] are enough reasons to look for alternatives . </S>",
    "<S> interesting proposals are the quantum cosmic model [ 7 ] and @xmath5 theories ( see [ 8 ] for recent reviews and references therein ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we have a plethora of dynamical dark energy models such as quintessence [ 9 ] , tachyon [ 10 ] , phantom[11 ] , quintom [ 12 ] , etc . but these scalar field </S>",
    "<S> dark energy models are only seen as an effective description of the underlying theory of dark energy .    in search of a more profound approach , </S>",
    "<S> holographic dark energy models [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] have been recently advanced which rely on the holographic principle [ 16 ] , which is believed to be a fundamental principle in the quantum theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore these models incorporate significant features of the underlying theory of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic principle is a conjecture stating that all the information stored within some volume can be described by the physics at the boundary of the volume and , in the cosmological context , this principle will set an upper bound on the entropy of the universe . with the bekenstein bound in mind </S>",
    "<S> , it seems to make sense to require that for an effective quantum field theory in a box of size @xmath6 with a short distance cutoff ( @xmath7 cutoff : @xmath8 ) , the total entropy should satisfy the relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath11 is the entropy of a black hole of radius @xmath6 which acts as a long distance cutoff ( ir cutoff : @xmath6 ) . however , based on the validity of effective quantum field theory cohen et al [ 13 ] suggested a more stringent bound , requiring that the total energy in a region of size @xmath6 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size </S>",
    "<S> .    therefore , this @xmath12 relationship gives an upper bound on the zero point energy density    @xmath13    which means that the maximum entropy is @xmath14 the largest @xmath6 is chosen by saturating the bound in eq.(2 ) so that we obtain the holographic dark energy density @xmath15 where c is a free dimensionless @xmath16 parameter and the coefficient 3 is chosen for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this @xmath3 is comparable to the observed dark energy density @xmath17 for @xmath18 , the hubble parameter at the present epoch . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that quantum field theory over - counts the independent physical degrees of freedom inside the volume explains the success of this estimation over the naive estimate @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , holographic dark energy models have the advantage over other models of dark energy in that they do not need an @xmath20 mechanism to cancel the @xmath21 zero point energy of the vacuum .    if we take @xmath6 as the hubble scale @xmath22 , then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result . </S>",
    "<S> however , hsu @xcite pointed out that this yields a wrong equation of state for dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> this led li @xcite to propose that the ir cut - off @xmath6 should be taken as the size of the future event horizon of the universe @xmath23    this allows to construct a satisfactory holographic dark energy model that may provide natural solutions to both dark energy problems as showed in [ 15 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth remarking , too , that the holographic dark energy model has been tested and constrained by several astronomical observations [ 17 ] . if we then assume the holographic vacuum energy scenario as the underlying theory of dark energy , we want to see how the scalar field model can be used to effectively describe it . </S>",
    "<S> some work has been done in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> holographic quintessence and holographic quintom models have been discussed in [ 18 ] and [ 19 ] respectively and the holographic tachyon model in [ 20 ] . </S>",
    "<S> other relevant works can be found in [ 21 ] . </S>",
    "<S> our present work aims at constructing the holographic kinetic k - essence model of dark energy , relating the kinetic k - essence scalar - field with the holographic dark energy .    in order to build our holographic model </S>",
    "<S> , we impose the holographic nature to the kinetic k - essence , i.e. , we identify @xmath24 with @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a universe filled with a matter component @xmath25 ( including both baryons and cold dark matter ) and an holographic kinetic k - essence component @xmath24 , the friedman equation reads @xmath26 or equivalently @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the redshift of the universe . from the definition of the holographic dark energy and the definition of the future event horizon , we find @xmath29 the friedman equation ( [ fridmann1 ] ) implies @xmath30 substituting  ( [ ha ] ) into  ( [ holo ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the following equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 . the differential equation for the fractional density of dark energy </S>",
    "<S> is obtained by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath33 in both sides of equation  ( [ ha1 ] ) , yielding @xmath34 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation has an exact solution [ 15 ] and describes the evolution of the holographic dark energy as a function of the redshift . since @xmath36 is always positive , the fraction of dark energy increases with time . from the energy conservation equation of dark energy , the equation of state of dark energy </S>",
    "<S> can be given [ 15 ] @xmath37 note that the formula @xmath38 and the differential equation of @xmath39 , eq.([omegadez ] ) , are used in the second equal sign .    </S>",
    "<S> usually k - essence is defined as a scalar field @xmath40 with a non - canonical kinetic energy associated with a lagrangian @xmath41 . in the subsequent calculations , we shall restrict ourselves to the simple k - essence models for which the potential @xmath42 constant . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that @xmath43 without any loss of generality . </S>",
    "<S> one reason for studying k - essence it that it is possible to construct a particularly interesting class of such models in which the k - essence energy density tracks the radiation energy density during the radiation - dominated era , but then evolves toward a constant - density dark energy component during the matter - dominated era . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior can to a certain degree solve the coincidence problem [ 22 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a dark energy model described by an effective minimally coupled scalar field with a non - canonical term . </S>",
    "<S> if for a moment we neglect the part of the lagrangian containing ordinary matter , the general action for a k - essence field @xmath40 minimally coupled to gravity is    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is an arbitrary function of @xmath40 that represents the k - essence action and @xmath46 is the kinetic term .    we now restrict ourselves to the subclass of kinetic k - essence , with an action independent of @xmath40 @xmath47 we assume a friedman - robertson - walker metric @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the scale factor ) and work in units @xmath50 . unless stated otherwise , we consider @xmath40 to be smooth on scales of interest so that @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy - momentum tensor of the k - essence is obtained by varying the action ( [ actionkessence ] ) with respect to the metric , yielding @xmath52 where the subscript @xmath53 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath53 . identifying ( [ energy - momentkessence ] ) with the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid we have the k - essence energy density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath54    @xmath55    and @xmath56    throughout this paper , we will assume that the energy density is positive so that @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state for the k - essence fluid can be written as @xmath58 with with @xmath59 , @xmath60 for a flat frw metric , applying the euler - lagrange equation for the field to the action ( [ actionkessence ] ) we find the equation of motion for k - essence field @xmath61 which can be rewritten in terms of @xmath53 as @xmath62 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time and @xmath63 is the hubble parameter . if we now change the independent variable from time @xmath64 to the scale factor @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath66 this equation can be integrated exactly , for arbitrary @xmath67 , yielding @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant of integration [ 23 ] . given a function @xmath1 , eq.([phiequation3 ] ) allows us to find solutions @xmath70 and then the other parameters of the k - essence fluid like @xmath24 , @xmath54 and @xmath71 as a function of the scale factor , @xmath65 .    from eqs.([rokessence]),([wkessence ] ) and ( [ vv ] ) , we e can obtain the expression for @xmath67 as a function of the redshift z @xmath72    note that , since @xmath73 , the above expression indicates that @xmath67 is positive in this approach . </S>",
    "<S> if we demand that the energy density be positive , eq.([rokessence ] ) implies that @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for kinetic k - essence , @xmath59 and @xmath75 imply that @xmath76 ( cf.[24 ] noticing the difference in the sign convention for the energy density and the pressure ) . </S>",
    "<S> now we focus on the reconstruction of @xmath1 in the redshift range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 which is the current range for the supernova data . </S>",
    "<S> we shall do so in the light of the holographic dark energy with @xmath79 as the future event horizon is only well defined when @xmath80 ( see [ 15 ] ) . as an example , we plot in fig.1 some evolutions of the equation of state of the holographic dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the plot the cases @xmath81 and @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that for these cases @xmath0 , they always evolve in the region of @xmath83 .    , and </S>",
    "<S> show the cases for @xmath84 , 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 . ]    in order to carry out the numerical evaluation which allows to find @xmath67 as a function of @xmath53 , we use the dimensionless variable @xmath85 . rewriting eq.([phiequation3 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> yields @xmath86 where the usual relation @xmath87 has been used . defining the function @xmath88 by @xmath89 </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain the following expression which allows us to determine @xmath53 as a function of @xmath35 @xmath90 we assume that @xmath91 in order to have real solutions for @xmath53 . integrating the above equation yields @xmath92 which admits the following analytical solution @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the current values for @xmath53 and @xmath96 .    from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fdez ] ) and ( [ xdezexplicitx0anal ] ) we can obtain the function @xmath97 .    as me mention before , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fdez ] ) , @xmath67 must be necessarily positive and a monotonically increasing function with @xmath35 within the relevant redshift range , for an accelerating universe with holographic dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is shown in fig.2 .     in units of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> here we take @xmath99 , and show the cases for @xmath84 , 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 . ]    likewise , the behaviour of @xmath100 as a function of the redshift @xmath35 is showed in fig.3 .    . </S>",
    "<S> here we take @xmath99 , and show the cases for @xmath84 , 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the holographic kinetic k - essence , represented by the function @xmath101 is plotted in fig.4 as a function of @xmath100 . from figs . @xmath102 and @xmath103 we can see the dynamic of the k - essence field explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath53 in the relevant redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> this is because for @xmath104 , the sign of @xmath105 is related to the value of @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> we should emphasise that the reconstruction of @xmath1 only involves the portion of it over which the field evolves to give the requires @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , figs . @xmath108 and @xmath103 are very similar to the ones shown in [ 25 ] for the transient case although the author was dealing there with a non - holographic model in which the ansatz for the hubble parameter @xmath107 was obtained by modelling the dark energy as a generalised chaplygin gas . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the reconstructed @xmath97 is a well - behaved , single valued function .     in units of @xmath98 . </S>",

    "<S> the holographic dark energy models depend mainly on the parameter @xmath109 . from eq.([eos ] ) , we see that the equation of state satisfies @xmath110 due to @xmath111 , showing that the parameter @xmath109 plays a key role in the holographic evolution of the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath112 , the case we are studying , the equation of state will evolve in the region of @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath109 should be determined by cosmological observations in the holographic scenario . </S>",

    "<S> an analysis of some of the latest observational data , including the gold sample of 182 snia , the cmb shift parameter given by the 3-year wmap observations , and the bao measurement from the sdss , showed that the possibilities of @xmath114 and @xmath115 both exist and their likelihoods are almost equal within 3 sigma error range [ 26 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> k - essence models with different @xmath1 have been discussed in the literature . for the holographic kinetic k - essence model constructed in this paper , the reconstructed @xmath1 </S>",

    "<S> if we take @xmath84 , the behaviour is similar to the cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath114 , the equation of state of dark energy will be always larger than @xmath116 and therefore the universe does not enter the de sitter phase and avoids the occurrence of a big rip . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we see explicitly that the value of @xmath109 is paramount for the holographic dark energy model as it determines the feature of the holographic dark energy as well as the ultimate fate of the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> as has been analysed above , the holographic dark energy scenario reveals the dynamical nature of the vacuum energy . on the other hand , as has already been mentioned , the scalar field dark energy models are often viewed as effective description of the underlying theory of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the latter theory can not be achieved before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established . in spite of this , we can speculate about the underlying theory of dark energy by taking some principles of quantum gravity into account . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy model is no doubt a tentative in this way .    to sum up </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that a holographic dark energy with @xmath0 can be totally described by kinetic k - essence in a certain way . a correspondence between holographic dark </S>",
    "<S> energy and kinetic k - essence has been established , and the holographic kinetic k - essence function @xmath1 has been reconstructed for the redshift range between @xmath77 and @xmath78 . </S>"
