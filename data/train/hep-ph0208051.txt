    "the electromagnetic ( e.m . ) structure of the nucleons , as revealed first time in elastic electron - nucleon scattering almost half a century ago , is completely described by four independent scalar functions of one variable called form factors ( ff s ) .",
    "they depend on the square momentum transfer @xmath9 of the virtual photon .",
    "nucleon e.m .",
    "ff s can be chosen in a divers way , e.g. as the dirac and pauli ff s , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or the sachs electric and magnetic ff s , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or isoscalar and isovector dirac and pauli ff s , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and isoscalar and isovector electric and magnetic ff s , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , respectively .",

    "from all four sachs ff s the neutron electric ff plays a particular role . though the total neutron charge is zero , there is a nonvanishing distribution of charge , which leads to the nonvanishing neutron electric ff .",
    "the isoscalar and isovector dirac and pauli ff s are suitable for a construction of various phenomenological models of the nucleon e.m .",
    "the most attractive of them is the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) picture in the framework of which ff s are simply saturated by a set of isoscalar and isovector vector meson poles on the positive real axis .",
    "however , this turns out to be practically an insufficient approximation and in a more realistic description of the data ( especially in the time - like region ) instability of vector - mesons has to be taken into account and the contributions of continua , to be created by n - particle thresholds , like , e.g. , @xmath35 etc .",

    "more recent precise measurements are presented in [ @xcite ] . besides the latter",
    ", there are also very accurate data on the ratio of proton electric and magnetic ff s [ @xcite ] obtained at the jefferson lab for @xmath36 by using polarization transfer and the new data on the neutron electric ff from bates [ @xcite ] , mami [ @xcite ] and nikhef [ @xcite ] .    for the time - like region data",

    "structure , defined on the four - sheeted riemann surface with canonical normalizations and qcd asymptotics , which provides a very effective framework for a superposition of complex conjugate vector - meson pole pairs on unphysical sheets and continua contributions in nucleon e.m .",
    "the model contains , e.g. , an explicit two - pion continuum contribution given by the unitary cut starting with @xmath37 and automatically predicts the strong enhancement of the left wing of the @xmath0 resonance in the isovector spectral functions to be consistent with the results of [ @xcite ] .",
    "another result of the presented model is the prediction of parameters of the fourth excited state of the @xmath0 meson and the automatic prediction of isoscalar nucleon spectral function behaviours . at the same time , a description of all existing space - like and time - like nucleon e.m .",
    "ff data , including also fenice ( frascati ) results on the neutron from the @xmath38 process , is achieved .",

    "structure with canonical normalizations and asymptotics as predicted by the quark model of hadrons is constructed .",
    "evaluation of all free parameters of the model ( however , with clear physical meaning ) by a fit of all existing data is carried out in section 3 . in section 4 .",

    "ff s as predicted [ @xcite ] by the quark model of hadrons .    here",
    "we would like to note that a further procedure will not mean any mathematically correct derivation of the unitary and analytic model , but only an ( noncommutative ) algorithm of its construction which is , however , generally valid also for any other strongly interacting particles .    in order to take into account the first feature ,",
    "one starts with saturation of the isoscalar and isovector parts of the dirac and pauli ff s by the isoscalar and isovector vector mesons possessing the quantum numbers of the photon . as there are no data on the nucleon e.m .",
    "ff s for reliable determination of resonance masses and widths in the region @xmath45 of manifestation of the majority of resonances under consideration , these parameters are fixed at the world averaged values .",
    "then , their consistency with existing ff data in other regions is investigated .    in review of particle physics [ @xcite ]",
    "we find just 5 isoscalar resonances @xmath46(782 ) , @xmath47(1020 ) , @xmath48(1420 ) , @xmath49(1600 ) , @xmath50(1680 ) with the required properties .",
    "however , one finds there only 3 isovector resonances @xmath51(770 ) , @xmath52(1450 ) , @xmath53(1700 ) with quantum numbers of the photon . on the other hand ,",
    "we have gained experience in our previous analyses that the most stable description of existing data is achieved if an equal number of isoscalar and isovector vector meson resonances in the investigated models is taken into account .",
    "therefore , in the isovector dirac and pauli ff s we consider the third excited state of the @xmath51-meson , @xmath54(2150 ) , revealed in [ @xcite ] , and in order to achieve also a description of the time - like region data on proton at higher energies from fermilab [ @xcite ] and neutron data from frascati [ @xcite ] , we also introduce hypothetically the fourth excited state of the @xmath51-meson , @xmath55 , the mass and width of which are left to be free parameters of the model .",
    "as one will see later from the comparison of the unitary and analytic model with all existing data , those resonance parameters will be found to be quite reasonable , and a simultaneous description of the space - like and time - like nucleon ff data , including the fenice ( frascati ) results on the neutron , will be achieved .    with the aim of incorporation of the third feature of nucleon e.m .",
    "ff s we transform vmd parametrizations of the isoscalar and isovector parts of the dirac and pauli ff s into the common denominators .",
    "the explicit requirement of the normalizations ( [ d6 ] ) and the asymptotic behaviours    @xmath56    lead ( for more detail see appendix a ) again to the zero - width vmd parametrization of the isoscalar and isovector parts of the dirac and pauli ff s    @xmath57    however , they are already automaticly normalized and they govern the asymptotics ( 7 ) as predicted by qcd up to the logarithmic corrections .    despite the latter properties the model is unable to reproduce the existing experimental information properly and only its unitarization , i.e. , inclusion of the contributions of continua and instability of vector - meson resonances , leads to a simultaneous description of the space - like and time - like data .",
    "it is well known that the unitarity condition requires the imaginary part of the nucleon e.m .",
    "ff s to be different from zero only above the lowest branch point @xmath58 and , moreover , it just predicts its smoothly varying behaviour ( see e.g. [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the unitarization of the model ( [ d8])-([d11 ] ) can be achieved by application of the following special non - linear transformations @xmath59 ^ 2}\\\\ t = t_0^v-\\frac{4(t_{in}^{1v}-t_0^v)}{[1/w - w]^2}\\label{d12}\\\\ \\nonumber t = t_0^s-\\frac{4(t_{in}^{2s}-t_0^s)}{[1/u - u]^2}\\\\ \\nonumber t = t_0^v-\\frac{4(t_{in}^{2v}-t_0^v)}{[1/x - x]^2},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , and a subsequent incorporation of the nonzero values of vector meson widths .    here",
    "@xmath60 are square - root branch points , as it is transparent from the inverse transformations to ( [ d12 ] ) , e.g    @xmath61    and similarly for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is clear .",
    "they are the lowest branch points of isoscalar and isovector dirac and pauli ff s on the positive real axis , respectively , as in the isoscalar case the 3-pion states and in the isovector case the 2-pion states are the lowest intermediate mass states in the unitarity conditions of the corresponding ff s .",
    "however , as it follows just from the unitarity conditions of ff s , there is an infinite number of allowed higher mass intermediate states and as a result there is an infinite number of the corresponding branch points ( and thus , an infinite number of branch cut contributions ) in every of the considered nucleon ff s .    since",
    ", in principle , an infinite number of cuts can not be taken into account in any theoretical scheme , we restrict ourselves in every isoscalar and isovector dirac and pauli ff to the two - cut approximation .",
    "the second one , an effective inelastic cut , in every isoscalar and isovector dirac and pauli ff is generated just by the square - root branch points @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "they are free parameters of the model and the data themselves , by a fitting procedure , will choose for them such numerical values that the contributions of the corresponding square - root cuts will be practically equivalent to the contributions of an infinite number of unitary branch cuts in every considered ff .    some experts are suggesting to fix these square - root branch points at the @xmath67 threshold . however , it will be demonstrated in section 3 that this can be done only in the case of isovector parts of dirac and pauli ff s , but in none of the cases of the isoscalar parts of the dirac and pauli ff s .",
    "so , by application of ( [ d12 ] ) to ( [ d8])-([d11 ] ) , for every isoscalar and isovector dirac and pauli ff one gets one analytic function in the whole complex @xmath68-plane besides two right - hand cuts ( see appendix b ) of the following forms : @xmath69&=&\\left(\\frac{1-v^2}{1-v_n^2}\\right)^4\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2 } h_{\\omega''}(v)\\cdot l_{\\omega'}(v)+ \\left [ h_{\\omega''}(v)\\cdot l_{\\omega}(v)\\cdot \\frac{c^{1s}_{\\omega''}-c^{1s}_{\\omega}}{c^{1s}_{\\omega''}-c^{1s}_{\\omega'}}\\right.\\right .",

    "structure comprises too many ( though with clear physical meaning ) free parameters .",
    "we believe that the responsibility for such a situation rests with various experimental groups confirming [ @xcite ] nowadays so many vector - meson resonances possessing the quantum numbers of the photon , as a substantial majority of free parameters of the model are coupling constats just of these vector - mesons under consideration with nucleons .",
    "once these vector - meson resonances exist , they can not be ignored in any theoretical considerations , including theoretical models of the nucleon e.m .",
    "structure .",
    "a solution for lowering the number of free parameters could be true numerical values of these coupling constants , however , brought from outside of the considered model .",
    "nevertheless , for the determination of coupling constants there is no reliable theory up to now and as a consequence , one is forced to consider them to be free parameters of the model .    for numerical evaluation of the parameters ( [ d26 ] )",
    "we have collected 512 experimental points which have been discussed in more detail in the introduction .",
    "the data have been analyzed by relations ( [ d5 ] ) and ( [ d14])-([d17 ] ) by using the cern program minuit .",
    "the best description of them was achieved with @xmath75 and the following values of free parameters : @xmath76    if , on the basis of suggestions of some experts , the parameters @xmath77 are fixed at the @xmath67 threshold , the best description of existing data is achieved with a worse value of @xmath78 and the rest parameters as follows : @xmath79    from the comparison of the numerical values of ( [ d28 ] ) with ( [ d27 ] ) we come to the conclusions that by fixing the second branch points of the isoscalar and isovector dirac and pauli ff s at the nucleon - antinucleon threshold the coupling constant ratios of isovector vector - mesons to nucleons ( the mass and the width of @xmath80 as well ) are almost unchanged , but the coupling constant ratios of isoscalar vector - mesons to nucleons ( especially of higher vector - mesons ) are remarkably out of order .",
    "this fact has explanation in the values of parameters of ( [ d27 ] ) where the thresholds @xmath77 were left to be found in a fitting procedure of data . in the isovector case , they were determined around the value corresponding to the nucleon - antinucleon threshold and , as a result , it does not matter if they are fixed at the @xmath67 threshold or they are found almost at the same position in a fitting procedure .",
    "however , in the isoscalar case they are found at much lower values than the @xmath67 threshold .",
    "so , those values indicate ( unlike the isovector ff s ) that between the lowest @xmath81 branch point and the @xmath67 threshold there is some allowed intermediate mass state in the unitarity condition generating an important cut contribution which can not be neglected in a description of the nucleon e.m .",
    "we know from other considerations that it is just the @xmath82 threshold .",
    "compilation of world nucleon ff data and their description by our ten - resonance unitary and analytic model with parameters ( [ d27 ] ) is graphically represented in figs .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "4 that unlike papers [ @xcite ] the ten - resonance unitary and analytic model is able to describe fenice time - like data on neutron [ @xcite ] quite well .",
    "the same is also valid for the fermilab proton time - like data [ @xcite ] ( see fig .",
    "the latter was possible to achieve by introducing a hypothetical fourth excited state of the @xmath51(770)-meson the parameters of which were found in a fitting procedure of all existing data to be quite reasonable ( see ( [ d27 ] ) ) .",
    "its existence , however , has to be proved by being identified also in other processes and not only @xmath83 .    of particular interest",

    "one can immediately notice large value of the @xmath4 coupling constants which may indicate violation of the ozi rule [ @xcite ] .    using the numerical values ( [ d38 ] )",
    "one can predict the @xmath85 mixing angle employing the relation @xmath86 it takes the value @xmath87 which is very close to the ideal mixing .    nevertheless , the most important predictions of the unitary and analytic model of the nucleon e.m .",

    ". just agreement of our predictions with those obtained by means of the frazer and fulco unitarity relation convinces us that our model constructed in this paper is really unitary .",
