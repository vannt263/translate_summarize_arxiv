    "the dynamically relaxed centers of clusters are surrounded by infall regions in which galaxies are bound to the cluster but not in an equilibrium configuration .",
    "the mass of such an infall region could be of the order 20 - 120% of the virial mass , showing that clusters are still forming @xcite .",
    "the galaxy population in that region is not pristine , since significant preprocessing in group - like environments are expected @xcite .",
    "groups of galaxies , of different richness and density , are also typical galaxy aggregates of low density environments . since they contain a substantial fraction of the mass of the universe , it is of crucial importance to shed light about the galaxy evolution in such an environments .",
    "the low velocity dispersion in groups leads to slow encounters between member galaxies and is predicted to trigger star formation episodes ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and agn activity .",
    "nearby groups do not show , however , firm evidence for galaxy activity enhancement @xcite .",
    "the interaction processes are not only altering the overall characteristics of the involved galaxies , they also could affect the group galaxy population ( e.g via galaxy - galaxy merging and/or formation of tidal dwarf galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and of the igm .",

    "however it is still unclear whether massive groups , whose dominant galaxy is a spiral , do exist @xcite .",
    "evolutionary phenomena in poor structures are furthermore of interest in the context of a evolving galaxy groups since candidate `` fossil groups '' , i.e. the debris of a pristine group , are found at low and intermediate redshifts @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary scenario of isolated galaxy groups raises then fundamental questions : what is the final stage of small galaxy structures in the field ?",
    "are they stable and long - lived structures or does their evolution lead to the formation of giant elliptical galaxies in the field traced by the detected x ",
    "ray diffuse emission ?",
    "several arguments indicate that photometric parameters of massive ellipticals are not compatible with their formation being the result of several major merging events diluted along the hubble time @xcite . moreover , massive early - type galaxies in low density environments appear on the average only 2 gyr younger than their counterparts in high density environments @xcite .",
    "because a considerable fraction of massive galaxy formation in low density environments occurs at redshifts @xmath3 , the end product of groups observed out to @xmath4 could not easily be a new massive early - type galaxy .",
    "in this paper we present the optical , photometric and spectroscopic properties of the poor group dominated by the bright elliptical galaxy ngc  5328 .",
    "the group has a compact and elongated shape : galaxies are basically aligned in a long chain spanning from northeast to southwest .",
    "ngc  5328 is well centered within this galaxy chain .",
    "this group is located in the vicinity of the abell  3574 cluster of galaxies .",
    "our photometric and spectroscopic investigation covers the central part of the group including seven spectroscopically confirmed , bright member galaxies distributed over a radius of about 100 kpc ( h@xmath0=70 km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 ) .",
    "we also provide positions and the basic photometric properties of dwarf galaxies , lying within our frames , candidate members of the group .",

    "we summarize the literature data about ngc 5328 group .",
    "section  3 presents the observations and the data reduction .",
    "the detailed surface photometry , the analysis of galaxy structures and a preliminary description of the spectroscopic properties of each galaxy are given in section  4 .",
    "medium - resolution spectroscopy is used to establish group memberships and to analyze the spectral energy distributions in order to check possible features like induced activity and enhanced star formation .",
    "line - strength indices which , transformed into the lick - ids system , were modeled to infer the star formation history of the bright galaxies in the group , are presented in section  5 .",

    "the ngc  5328 group of galaxies was first mentioned by @xcite as the object nr .  28 in his catalogue of `` groups and clusters of southern galaxies '' .",
    "the author described the structure as a `` group of round or somewhat elongated galaxies with one spiral to ne '' . in the original description , klemola  28 consists of 7 galaxies within an area of 15@xmath55 , although the member galaxies are not named .",
    "given the coordinates of klemola 28 and the description of the group structure , we presume that the members of klemola  28 coincide with the bright galaxies of the present study .",
    "@xcite associates ngc  5328 with the well studied seyfert galaxy ic  4329 and 21 other galaxies to the group lgg  357 .",
    "a quite similar set of galaxies is given by @xcite in his nog  725 .",
    "none of the galaxies considered in our study is part of the lgg or the nog sample .",
    "ic  4329 is located at a projected distance of about 2.5 mpc from ngc  5328 and belongs to the abell  3574 cluster of galaxies , a poor cluster consisting of 55 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies moving with a recession velocity of @xmath6 km s@xmath1 and having a velocity dispersion of @xmath7 = 793 km s@xmath1 @xcite . in the red - shift space our group and the cluster form a coherent structure with a virtually null difference in their systemic velocity ( v@xmath8  v@xmath9 = 39 km s@xmath1 ) . the projected separation between the ngc  5328 group and the cluster outskirts amounts to @xmath10 1@xmath1120@xmath12 ( corresponding to 1.7  mpc ) .",
    "thus , although the group can not be characterized as a substructure of the cluster , the group and the cluster could be potentially connected .",
    "@xcite presents a list of prominent galaxies on the plates 444 and 445 of the eso - src survey , giving the morphological classifications for all galaxies in our sample and including redshifts for ngc  5328 and ngc  5330 .    concerning the properties of individual galaxies of our sample , mcg  53329",
    "is quoted in the `` catalog of southern ringed galaxies '' @xcite but only ngc  5328 has been studied in detail so far .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed surface photometry , indicating that ngc  5328 is a `` bona fide '' elliptical .",
    "several values for the central velocity dispersion are available , with an average of 303 km  s@xmath1 ( http://www-obs.univ-lyon1.fr/hypercat ) , the latest measurement by @xcite amounts to @xmath7 = 314 @xmath13 7 km  s@xmath1 suggesting that it is a massive galaxy .",
    "ngc  5328 is a relatively strong x - ray emitter .",

    "the morphology and the characteristics of the x - ray emission are not discussed .",
    "@xcite presented a unified relation between l@xmath15 and @xmath7 for 280 clusters and 57 galaxies of the form l@xmath16 with a slope steepening from @xmath17=4.4 for clusters to @xmath17=10.2 for individual galaxies .",
    "the relation for groups is not that well defined and shows a larger scatter suggesting that most of them have either not yet reached dynamical equilibrium or the emission is produced by unresolved sources in the igm .",
    "ngc  5328 is included in the sample of individual galaxies and lies exactly on the l@xmath18 relation .",
    "the discussion of the x - ray properties of ngc  5328 as a group , and its evolutionary phase , then awaits more detailed x - ray observations ."
