    "in this work , we present two distributional operations which identify relationships between seemingly different classes of random variables which are representable as linear functionals of a  dirichlet process , otherwise known as _ dirichlet means_. specifically , the first operation consists of multiplication of a dirichlet mean by an independent beta random variable and the second operation involves an exponential change of measure to the density of a related infinitely divisible random variable having a generalized gamma convolution distribution  ( ggc ) .",
    "this latter operation is often referred to in the statistical literature as _ exponential tilting _ or in mathematical finance as an _ esscher transform_. we believe our results add a significant component to the foundational work of cifarelli and regazzini  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "our results allow one to use the often considerable analytic work on obtaining results for one dirichlet mean to obtain results for an entire family of otherwise seemingly unrelated mean functionals .",
    "it also allows one to obtain explicit densities for the related class of infinitely divisible random variables which are generalized gamma convolutions and an explicit description of the finite - dimensional distribution of their associated lvy processes ( see bertoin  @xcite for the formalities of general lvy processes ) .",
    "the importance of this latter statement is that lvy processes now commonly appear in a variety of applications in probability and statistics , but there are relatively few cases where the relevant densities have been described explicitly .",
    "a detailed summary and outline of our results may be found in section  [ sec : outline ] .",
    "some background information on , and notation for , dirichlet processes and dirichlet means , their connection with ggc random variables , recent references and some motivation for our work are given in the next section .",
    "let @xmath0 be a non - negative random variable with cumulative distribution function @xmath1 .",
    "note , furthermore , that for a measurable set @xmath2 we use the notation @xmath3 to mean the probability that @xmath0 is in @xmath4 one may define a dirichlet process random probability measure ( see freedman  @xcite and ferguson  @xcite ) , say @xmath5 on @xmath6 with total mass parameter @xmath7 and prior parameter @xmath8 via its finite - dimensional distribution as follows : for any disjoint partition on @xmath6 , say @xmath9 , the distribution of the random vector @xmath10 is a @xmath11-variate dirichlet distribution with parameters @xmath12 hence , for each @xmath13 , @xmath14 has a beta distribution with parameters @xmath15 equivalently , setting@xmath16 for @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 are independent random variables with gamma@xmath20 distributions and @xmath21 has a gamma@xmath22 distribution .",
    "this means that one can define the dirichlet process via the normalization of an independent increment gamma process on @xmath6 , say @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , whose almost surely finite total random mass is @xmath26 a very important aspect of this construction is the fact that @xmath27 is independent of @xmath28 and hence of any functional of @xmath29 this is a natural generalization of lukacs @xcite characterization of beta and gamma random variables , which is fundamental to what is now referred to as the _ beta  gamma algebra _ ( for more on this , see chaumont and yor  ( @xcite , section 4.2 ) ; see also emery and yor  @xcite for some interesting relationships between gamma processes , dirichlet processes and brownian bridges ) .",
    "hereafter , for a random probability measure @xmath30 on @xmath31 we write @xmath32 to indicate that @xmath30 is a dirichlet process with parameters @xmath33    these simple representations and other nice features of the dirichlet process have , since the important work of ferguson  @xcite , contributed greatly to the relevance and practical utility of the field of bayesian non- and semi - parametric statistics .",
    "naturally , owing to the ubiquity of the gamma and beta random variables , the dirichlet process also arises in other areas .",
    "one of the more interesting and , we believe , quite important topics related to the dirichlet process is the study of the laws of random variables called _ dirichlet mean functionals _ , or simply dirichlet means , which we denote as @xmath34 as initiated in the works of cifarelli and regazzini  @xcite . in  @xcite , the authors obtained an important identity for the cauchy ",
    "stieltjes transform of order @xmath35 this identity is often referred to as the _ markov  krein identity _ , as can be seen in , for example , diaconis and kemperman  @xcite , kerov  @xcite and vershik , yor and tsilevich  @xcite , where these authors highlight its importance to , for instance , the study of the markov moment problem , continued fraction theory and exponential representation of analytic functions .",
    "this identity is later called the _ cifarelli",
    " regazzini identity _ in  @xcite .",
    "cifarelli and regazzini  @xcite , owing to their primary interest , used this identity to then obtain explicit density and cdf formulae for @xmath36 the density formulae may be seen as abel - type transforms and hence do not always have simple forms , although we stress that they are still useful for some analytic calculations .",
    "the general exception is the case @xmath37 , which has a nice form .",
    "some examples of works that have proceeded along these lines are cifarelli and melilli  @xcite , regazzini , guglielmi and di nunno  @xcite , regazzini , lijoi and prnster @xcite , hjort and ongaro  @xcite , lijoi and regazzini  @xcite , and epifani , guglielmi and melilli  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent works of  bertoin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and james , lijoi and prnster  @xcite  ( see also  @xcite , which is a  preliminary version of this work ) show that the study of mean functionals is relevant to the analysis of phenomena related to bessel and brownian processes .",
    "in fact , the work of james , lijoi and prnster  @xcite identifies many new explicit examples of dirichlet means which have interesting interpretations .",
    "related to these last points , lijoi and regazzini  @xcite have highlighted a close connection to the theory of generalized gamma convolutions  ( see  @xcite ) . specifically , it is known that a rich subclass of random variables having generalized gamma convolutions  ( ggc ) distributions may be represented as @xmath38 we call these random variables ggc@xmath33 in addition , we see from  ( [ gammarep ] ) that @xmath39 is a random variable derived from a weighted gamma process and , hence , the calculus discussed in lo  @xcite and lo and weng  @xcite applies .",
    "in general , ggc random variables are an important class of infinitely divisible random variables whose properties have been extensively studied by  @xcite and others .",
    "we note further that although we have written a ggc@xmath40 random variable as @xmath41 , this representation is not unique and , in fact , it is quite rare to see @xmath39 represented in this way .",
    "we will show that one can , in fact , exploit this non - uniqueness to obtain explicit densities for @xmath39 , even when it is not so easy to do so for @xmath36 while the representation @xmath41 is not unique , it helps one to understand the relationship between the laplace transform of @xmath39 and the cauchy ",
    "stieltjes transform of order @xmath7 of @xmath42 which , indeed , characterize respectively the laws of @xmath39 and @xmath36 specifically , using the independence property of @xmath27 and @xmath43 leads to , for @xmath44 @xmath45=\\mathbb{e}\\bigl[{\\bigl(1+\\lambda m_{\\theta}(f_{x})\\bigr)}^{-\\theta}\\bigr]=\\mathrm{e}^{-\\theta\\psi_{f_{x}}(\\lambda ) } , \\label{cs}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 \\label{levy}\\ ] ] is the _",

    "the expressions in  ( [ cs ] ) equate with the aforementioned identity obtained by cifarelli and regazzini  @xcite .    despite these interesting results ,",
    "there is very little work on the relationship between different mean functionals .",
    "suppose , for instance , that for each fixed value of @xmath50 @xmath43 denotes a  dirichlet mean and @xmath51 denotes a collection of dirichlet mean random variables indexed by a family of distributions @xmath52 one may then ask the following question : for what choices of @xmath0 and @xmath53 are these mean functionals related , and in what sense ?",
    "in particular , one may wish to know how their densities are related .",
    "the rationale here is that if such a relationship is established , then the effort that one puts forth to obtain results such as the explicit density of @xmath43 can be applied to an entire family of dirichlet means @xmath54 furthermore , since dirichlet means are associated with ggc random variables , this would establish relationships between a ggc@xmath40 random variable and a family of ggc@xmath55 random variables .",
    "simple examples are , of course , the choices @xmath56 and @xmath57 which , due to the linearity properties of mean functionals , result easily in the identities in law @xmath58    naturally , we are going to discuss more complex relationships , but with the same goal .",
    "that is , we will identify non - trivial relationships so that the often considerable efforts that one makes in the study of one mean functional @xmath43 can then be used to obtain more easily results for other mean functionals , their corresponding ggc random variables and lvy processes . in this paper",
    ", we will describe two such operations which we elaborate on in the next subsection .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] reviews some of the existing formulae for the densities and cdfs of dirichlet means . in section",
    "[ sec : beta ] , we will describe the operation of multiplying a mean functional @xmath59 by an independent beta random variable with parameters @xmath60 say , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 we call this operation _",
    "beta scaling_. theorem  [ thm1beta ] shows that the resulting random variable @xmath63 is again a mean functional , but now of order @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the ggc@xmath64 random variable @xmath65 is equivalently a ggc random variable of order @xmath35 now , keeping in mind that tractable densities of mean functionals of order @xmath37 are the easiest to obtain , theorem  [ thm1beta ] shows that by setting @xmath37 , the densities of the uncountable collection of random variables @xmath66 are all mean functionals of order @xmath67 theorem  [ thm2beta ] then shows that efforts used to calculate the explicit density of any one of these random variables , via the formulae of  @xcite , lead to the explicit calculation of the densities of all of them .",
    "additionally , theorem  [ thm2beta ] shows that the corresponding ggc random variables may all be expressed as ggc random variables of order @xmath68 representable in distribution as @xmath69 .",
    "a key point here is that theorem  [ thm2beta ] gives a tractable density for @xmath70 without requiring knowledge of the density of @xmath71 which is usually expressed in a complicated manner .",
    "these results will also yield some non - obvious integral identities .",
    "furthermore , noting that a ggc@xmath40 random variable , @xmath72 is infinitely divisible , we associate it with an independent increment process @xmath73 known as a",
