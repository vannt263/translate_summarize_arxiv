    "<S> asymmetric raman profiles are seen as before , but again we find ( see si ) that while there is some contribution of interference between channels m and c , the main source of lineshape asymmetry originates again from the electronic sideband that dresses the rayleigh and vibrational scattering peaks mainly on their blue side . </S>",
    "<S> the `` electronic heating '' obtained here is stronger than in model a , closer to the magnitude observed experimentally , but the actual numbers should again be considered cautiously .    in conclusion , we have observed asymmetric lineshape features in raman scattering from bipyridyl ethylene molecules adsorbed on gold nanostructures , with the following characteristics : ( a ) asymmetry increases with incident light intensity . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the vibrational temperature appears not to increase even at the highest intensity used , while the apparent electronic temperature increases by up to @xmath112 k. the fano - like appearance of these lineshapes suggests the possibly implication of interference between different scattering pathways . </S>",
    "<S> model calculations show that such interference , leading to the observed asymmetry , is indeed possible in systems with strong enough electron - vibrational coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations suggest , however , that the observed lineshape asymmetry is dominated by electronic scattering sidebands that dress the rayleigh and vibrational scattering peaks , and its dependence on incident light intensity can be explained by an optically induced component in the molecule - metal electron - transfer coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this model also yields vibrational and electronic `` raman temperatures '' that are consistent with experimental observation , but may reflect the complex nature of the non - equlibrium response rather than the actual temperature . </S>",
    "<S> fano - type interference in raman scattering has been shown to be a theoretical possibility .    </S>",
