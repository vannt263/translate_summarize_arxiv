    "technology , in a traditional sense , is not the differentiator that attracts customers . in the bpm context ,",
    "the `` technology '' is about how the extensive functionality that is required for successfully automating a customer s mission - critical business processes is applied to solving their problem .",
    "business users are not information technology ( it ) experts and have difficulty relating technical designs to their business needs .",
    "furthermore , most business users have great difficulty articulating their needs since they have little experience or involvement working with complex process solutions .",
    "this has historically been a major impediment to creating successful bpm solutions .",
    "modern bpms products provide a rich application development infrastructure with significant out - of - the - box capabilities and extensive hooks for customization",
    ". this paper will provide information on these capabilities and the benefits that are provided .",
    "not only do these capabilities provide a rich environment for building solutions , but the combination of rapid solutions development and the rich internal constructs needed to support it amplify a designer s ability to conceptualize these solutions . by providing the major , base functionality ,",
    "these products allow architects and developers to focus on the unique aspects of each solution    the issues that make the difference between successful and unsuccessful projects .",
    "examples will be provided based on northrop grumman s e.power^^ bpms product .",
    "there are over 100 products in the bpm software product market as well as products servicing other software product segments that have bpm features . a small subset of these products offer the capabilities described in this paper .",
    "the implications of these capabilities are , perhaps , more significant than have previously been documented , and affect all aspects of the system development life cycle ( sdlc ) .",
    "bpm  rsd tools focus on providing the three key components required for any bpm solution : the business process or workflow , an application for doing the work , and forms as the basis for user interaction .",
    "these three components are illustrated in figure [ keycomp ] .",
    "the extent to which a particular bpm product provides these capabilities out - of - the - box is a measure of their `` out - of - the - boxness . ''",
    "keep in mind that not all bpm products have bpm rsd toolsets .        automating a business process involves two key steps :    202    creating an automated representation of the business process",
    "  see figure [ wfmap ] .",
    "drag and drop interfaces are the norm with bpm  rsd tools .",
    "note that in addition to being a visual representation of the process , it also defines the rules for the process in a backend store that is later used by the process engine for managing the work .",
    "engines of this type are said to be `` model - driven '' because changes to the model directly affect production instances of the process .",
    "other , less flexible approaches include configuration - driven and parameterized where a limited set of options are baked in by the product vendor .",
    "@xcite    creating an application for users to process their work ( see figure [ ui ] ) that is _ process - enabled_. for the toolset to be considered a bpm  rsd toolset , the user interface should be a byproduct of the application definition process    a declarative process rather than a programming exercise .",
    "while it is important to automatically generate the user interface , it is also important to provide customization hooks needed to tweek the interface , since rarely is the one - size - fits - all approach adequate .",
    "the primary purpose of process automation is process improvement .",
    "complex business processes are constantly changing    with or without explicit direction .",
    "factors such as changing business environments , government regulation , and competition are major drivers of these changes , necessitating changes in the support systems .    the traditional life - cycle development approaches to custom development",
    "are seriously challenged to support these dynamics .",
    "historically , requirements documentation , detailed systems design , development , and implementation could easily take 12 to 18 months to deliver a complex solution , during which time the business requirements may have changed significantly enough to require additional iterations prior to implementation .",
    "_ agility _ has become a popular term for describing the flexibility needed by organizations to operate in today s dynamic environments .",
    "agility is a natural by - product of bpm  rsd toolsets .",
    "agility is a critical feature of bpms products .",
    "agility in the bpm context is similar to , but not the same as the agile software development methodology , typically used in an iterative process for creating custom software .",
    "agility in the bpms space is more about using the built - in capabilities of the bpm product to _ avoid _ having to write custom software .",
    "custom software is needed as part of the creation process for most bpm solutions , but whenever it can be avoided , the resulting solution is less expensive and has fewer defects and lower risk . in order to differentiate this process from rapid applications development ( rad ) approaches ,",
    "i have coined the term `` bpm  rsd . ''",
    "another related software engineering concept is model - driven development .",
    "these techniques often include a framework in which software is developed , providing a powerful facility for leveraging the assets within the framework for reuse .",
    "the concept of ` models ' is critical to bpm products where the software architecture creates models of the organization s business operations    a key example being the model of the operational aspects of the business being encapsulated in the graphical process map .",
    "but as in the agile space , the model - driven development space is critically different from bpm  rsd in one respect : it is meant to either generate source code or provide a framework within which source code is written .",
    "bpm  rsd models are run - time models as well as design - time models and are designed to reduce the need to write custom software .",
    "so how are bpm  rsd tools different ?",
    "for agile or model - driven development , source code must be recompiled and redeployed when changes are made .",
    "although this might be done automatically , it does not produce a clean transition in production environments ; i.e. , it is not seemless to an operating business process .",
    "bpm  rsd products , however , store the semantics of process definitions in a repository    often a relational database    and execution engines dynamically drive production instances from this repository . changes to the repository using the bpm  rsd tools directly effect operational changes .",
    "another key distinction between frameworks and bpm  rsd tools is that frameworks require skilled software developers to `` wire up '' the framework in order to achieve the benefits .",
    "frameworks are analogous to e.powers api s plus our solution paradigm , but in e.power our framework has been pre - wired so that many of the technical requirements have already been resolved , allowing less skilled staff , or in some cases such as our process designer , non - technical staff , to contribute to solution development .",
    "frameworks also require that individual wires be `` soldered '' into the solution .",
    "bpm  rsd tools eliminate the need to do so and eliminate the possibility of _ neglecting _ to do so , insuring that critical functionality such as auditability , searchability , etc .",
    ", mentioned in the object types section of this paper , is included automatically .    in a very real sense ,",
    "bpm  rsd tools are pre - wired , or pre - compiled frameworks .",
    "similar approaches have arisen over the years in other business software categories .",
    "typically packaged as products to offset the increased cost of producing these solution sets , these products consist of design tools that are largely configuration - driven and produce robust implementations .",
    "such solution sets exist in the enterprise resource planning ( erp ) space , customer resource management space ( crm ) , as well as the bpm space .",
    "each of the design - time toolsets has unique characteristics .",
    "one of the key differentiators is how much functionality is delivered `` out - of - the - box '' and how much requires custom software development .",
    "this `` out - of - the - boxness '' has significant benefits beyond the obvious advantage of creating solutions quickly .",
    "successful bpm solutions must be customizable to each organization s unique requirements .",
    "gathering those requirements through traditional documentation approaches can be cumbersome and slow and produces paper - based models to validate the requirements    an imperfect model at best .",
    "bpm  rsd tools provide working models of the solution in days rather than weeks or months .",
    "the significant user interfaces and workflow needed for requirements validation can be mocked up very quickly , providing a significant portion of the solution in a totally objective fashion    via working software .",
    "select portions of the solution such as legacy systems integrations might be delayed to a later phase in order to minimize the impact on requirements gathering or to accelerate implementation in order to achieve operating efficiency gains earlier in the process .",
    "iterating with prototypes help business people and it staff objectify the end - product more quickly and accurately , greatly increasing the likelihood of a successful implementation .    the obvious advantage of bpm  rsd development is also important : rapid implementations .",
    "lengthy requirements efforts of many months suffer from the modern - day problem of a rapidly changing business context . how often have we seen a system that was well - designed and executed , but outdated by the time it was deployed ?",
    "bpm  rsd approaches reduce that risk .",
    "it is important to note that these prototypes are not throw - aways . to the extent",
    "they accurately reflect the underlying requirements , they become part of the final production solution .",
    "the key is that the tools used to develop proofs - of - concept , prototypes , and production systems are _ the same tools . _",
    "automation of business systems require creation of software modeling constructs that represent the key business objects in the problem domain .",
    "we refer to these constructs as _ object types_. these object types map to the real - world business objects in the same way that classes relate to class instances in object - oriented programming languages .",
    "object types could be thought of as index fields  or metadata on steroids .",
    "effective bpm  rsd tools require a rich structure for creating process - enabled applications of any complexity .",
    "this generic structure , while necessary to support the user interfaces generated , is also very effective at helping analysts conceptualize the ultimate solution .    in tools such as the e.power activator designer ,",
    "object types define the characteristics of the real - world business components that make up the solution and object instances model the actual instances of those business objects .",
    "a by - product of this approach is that objects and object types inherit many useful properties from the e.power activator infrastructure , features that might not be provided if the solution were created in a custom development effort .",
    "all e.power activator objects are inherently editable and searchable and all activity against them is auditable .",
    "the rules applied at design time help to insure data integrity .    for an equal employment opportunity ( eeo )",
    "application , object types might include complainant , class action lawsuit , and investigator . for a training solution , object type definitions would be needed for student , training class , and possibly training facility if the application was designed to model any of the facility behaviors .",
    "this direct mapping between it constructs and business constructs greatly facilitate communication between it staff and business staff and simplifies solution conceptualization .",
    "summarizing what we ve discussed so far , bpm  rsd tools provide the following key benefits over more traditional approaches .",
    "202    _ requirements gathering_. providing a prototype solution early in the requirements gathering process helps end users understand the possibilities and helps to shape their expectations .",
    "_ requirements validation_. working prototypes allow end users to understand exactly what they are getting .",
    "it is very difficult for end users to visualize how the software will affect how they work from paper documentation .",
    "prototypes help to eliminate the perennial problem of `` that s what i asked for but not what i need . ''",
    "_ analysis and design_. prototypes also assist designers in visualizing what the ultimate solution can and should look like .",
    "bpm  rsd capabilities allow them to draw from a toolbox of components that include `` nice - to - have '' features that might otherwise be omitted from the solution .    _",
    "documentation_. all solutions , whether using bpm  rsd or more traditional approaches , require many forms of documentation : documentation for project approval , documentation for design reviews , documentation for the quality assurance process , etc .",
    "having working prototypes early in the process makes all forms of documentation significantly easier to produce and much more effective . the clarity provided by actual screen - shots , process maps , and relational designs ( necessarily generated automatically by bpm  rsd tools ) benefits all participants in the review process , from end - users to the approving management staff .    _",
    "implementation_. implementation is the obvious area where bpm  rsd is valuable , allowing customers to achieve the benefits more quickly and less expensively than through traditional approaches .",
    "_ quality assurance_. the quality of a solution constructed through pre - built components is clearly higher since the out - of - the - box features have been refined through pre - existing , broad - based customer usage .",
    "new customers benefit from defects that were identified and resolved by other customers .",
    "additionally , for each product release , the software is quality - checked through an independent process .",
    "this allows _ project _ quality teams to focus on the customizations    the area most likely to introduce software defects .",
    "_ maintenance_. the area of maintenance aligns with the notion of agility  ",
    "being able to modify the production solution to adapt to changing conditions .",
    "the tools that facilitate rapid creation are typically the same tools used to update the solution as needs change over time .",
    "_ risk_. the bpm  rsd approach reduces risk in virtually all phases of the development effort .",
    "the functioning prototypes reduce the risk of building a _ good _ solution that is the _",
    "wrong _ solution . analysis and design",
    "are improved through the objectivity of these same functioning prototypes , reducing the risk of an incorrect design .",
    "quality is improved as noted above and therefore reduces the risk of poor quality .",
    "implementation , operation and maintenance are likewise facilitated , reducing risk in their respective areas as well .",
    "bpm  rsd products affect all aspects of the system development life cycle and , as we shall describe in the next section , fundamentally change the way we approach solutions .",
    "as stated earlier , these new capabilities suggest a new approach to solution creation . @xcite rather than the traditional waterfall approach of requirements , design , development , and implementation ,",
    "our approach is to use the following roadmap when engaging new customers .",
    "this approach is iterative : very similar to an agile software development approach , but the final result is achieved largely through model - manipulation rather than programming .    202    request existing documentation from the business users very early in the requirements gathering process .    1 .   a visio diagram or a description of the business process is the starting point for creating the process map .",
    "copies of key forms provide templates for some of the user - interfaces as well as the data fields needed for the application .",
    "prototype the solution using the bpm  rsd tools .    1 .",
    "use the graphical process designer to draw the business process which is more than visual : it encapsulates the business rules that drive the process .",
    "this graphical representation is critical to making sure it and the business users agree on the process details .",
    "2 .   use a declarative application builder for application creation .",
    "3 .   use a security manager for defining security profiles , often integrated with an existing ldap repository .    present the solution to the business users to refine the requirements and the solution .",
    "1 .   iterate on changes to the process diagram in interactive design sessions .",
    "2 .   modify the application in interactive design sessions .",
    "put the solution into production , often in phases to accelerate the initial benefits .    1 .",
    "create documentation from the prototype to support the organization s vetting process .",
    "2 .   get something into production quickly to get immediate benefits .",
    "3 .   defer complex integrations until later phases if possible .",
    "this relatively simple formula is significantly more effective than alternative methods .",
    "business users are able to react to high - fidelity prototypes rather than paper representations .",
    "bpm  rsd tools make it feasible to rapidly evolve the solutions  ",
    "interactively in design sessions with the end - users .",
    "bpm rapid solutions development tools make it possible to construct business process solutions much more quickly and effectively than in the past .",
    "end - users are able to interact with designers in an expressive environment that allows them to model the solution with the actual tools used to create the solution .",
    "rapid prototyping is a key to this approach and allows developers to build the solution that the business users need to satisfy their _ actual _ requirements    rather than the ones they `` asked for . ''",
    "this represents a major step forward in producing effective solutions .",
    "this approach results in lower risk of producing an ineffective solution and reduces defect rates by minimizing the amount of custom coding required to produce the solution .",
    "the end result is a much higher probability of successful projects .",
    "the bpms software market serviced by model - driven bpm  rsd tools may be unique in the it software industry ."
