    "the interaction between two nucleons based on chiral effective field theory has been studied in great detail over the past two decades , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "most calculations employ the effective chiral lagrangian formulated in terms of pions and nucleons that are chirally coupled with each other and to external sources .",
    "the excitation of baryon and meson resonances is encoded in the low - energy constants of the chiral pion - nucleon interaction terms of higher order .",
    "such a framework provides an accurate description of the empirical nucleon - nucleon phase shifts , if extended to sufficiently high order . at the present time , calculations have been carried out up to order n@xmath2lo in the chiral ( low - momentum ) expansion @xcite and the incorporation of dominant contributions at order n@xmath3lo is underway . still , it can be argued the explicit inclusion the @xmath0-isobar , the most prominent resonance in nuclear physics , allows one to resum a certain class of important contributions and therefore may lead to an improved convergence . in such a phenomenological extension of baryon chiral perturbation theory",
    "the delta - nucleon mass splitting , @xmath4mev , is counted as an additional small scale parameter , comparable to the typical momentum @xmath5 or the pion mass @xmath6 .",
    "the finite - range parts of the @xmath7-exchange nn - interaction as generated by the pertinent triangle and box diagrams with intermediate @xmath0-isobars have been calculated first in ref .  @xcite using the feynman diagram technique .",
    "furthermore , the bochum - bonn group @xcite has worked out the subleading isospin - conserving corrections as well as the isospin - breaking corrections provided by the chirally interacting @xmath8-system .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze the two - nucleon interaction which arises from the exchange of three pions in combination with excitations of @xmath0-isobars in intermediate states . in this sense",
    "it represents an extension of earlier works on the @xmath9-exchange nn - interaction in refs .",
    "@xcite to chiral effective field theory with explicit @xmath0-isobar degrees of freedom .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "the techniques to the calculate spectral - functions ( or imaginary parts ) of two - loop @xmath9-exchange diagrams in the heavy nucleon mass limit are prepared . in order to facilitate an analytical treatment ( of at least the angular part ) of the involved @xmath9-phase space integrals ,",
    "the non - relativistic @xmath1-propagator will be approximated by the inverse mass - splitting @xmath10 .",
    "a consequence of this approximation is that the pion - induced excitation and deexcitation of virtual @xmath0-isobars can be conveniently condensed into ( symmetrized ) @xmath7- and @xmath9-contact vertices with a nucleon . in section  3 , analytical expressions",
    "are derived for the spectral - functions corresponding to the isoscalar and isovector central , spin - spin and tensor nn - potentials in momentum - space .",
    "this is separately done for five different classes of @xmath9-exchange diagrams which are grouped together according to the number of intermediate @xmath0-isobar excitations . for each class",
    "the resulting nn - potentials in coordinate - space are displayed in the distance region @xmath11@xmath12fm . as a summary one finds that the main effect of these specific exchange and excitation mechanisms is a repulsive isoscalar central nn - potential @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the contributions to the isovector tensor potential @xmath14 tend to cancel each other , while other components come out very small anyway .",
    "this overall result is remarkable in view of the fact that previous calculations of the chiral three - pion exchange nn - interaction in refs .",
    "@xcite have lead to a vanishing isoscalar central potential .",
    "let us start with recalling the form of the ( static ) nucleon - nucleon potential in momentum - space : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the momentum transfer between the initial- and final - state nucleons . the subscripts @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to the central , spin - spin and tensor - type components , each of which occurs in an isoscalar @xmath19 and an isovector version @xmath20 .",
    "the sign - convention for @xmath21 is chosen such that the usual one - pion exchange gives : @xmath22 .",

    "we are interested in the finite - range parts of @xmath21 that are generated by certain @xmath9-exchange diagrams . for this purpose",
    "it is sufficient to calculate the imaginary parts im@xmath26 and im@xmath27 , obtained by analytical continuation to time - like momentum transfer @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "these imaginary parts serve also as the mass spectra entering a representation of the ( local ) coordinate - space potentials in the form of a continuous superposition of yukawa functions : @xmath30\\ , , \\\\   \\widetilde v_t(r)&= &   { 1\\over 6\\pi^2 r^3}\\int_{3m_\\pi}^\\lambda\\ ! d\\mu\\,\\mu\\ ,",

    "@xmath33 a completely analogous representation holds .",
    "note that the tensor potentials @xmath34 and @xmath14 are accompanied by the usual tensor operator @xmath35 .",
    "making use of the cutkosky cutting rules , the imaginary parts entering eqs.(2,3,4 ) are calculated from the pertinent two - loop @xmath9-exchange diagrams as integrals of the @xmath36 transition amplitudes over the lorentz - invariant three - pion phase - space . in the center - of - mass frame this four - dimensional phase - space integral includes an angular part of the form : @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 the directional cosines of two pion - momenta @xmath40 .",
    "the unit - vector @xmath41 is introduced by the four - velocity @xmath42 of the heavy nucleon in the considered @xmath43-channel kinematics @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the integration region @xmath45 in eq.(5 ) is an ellipse @xmath46 with semi - axes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 ( see also eq.(28 ) ) . in order to allow for an analytical treatment of the angular integral in eq.(5 ) for all two - loop @xmath9-exchange diagrams , we approximate the non - relativistic delta - propagator by the inverse delta - nucleon mass splitting @xmath10 . in the case of a simple one - loop @xmath7-exchange triangle diagram this approximation leads to the inequality : @xmath50 where the complete result stands on the right hand side .",
    "a comparison of the associated central potentials reveals that the approximation using @xmath10 leads to an overestimation by about @xmath51 .",
    "although the kinematical situation is more complex for @xmath9-exchange , one can expect that the approximation using @xmath10 provides an upper bound for the nn - potentials with a similar error margin .",
    "once the energy - dependence of the delta - propagator is neglected , one can combine the direct and crossed @xmath0-isobar excitation to a @xmath7-contact vertex as symbolized by a filled square in the left diagram of fig.1",
    ". the corresponding transition matrix - element reads : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote both outgoing pion - momenta . in order to arrive at this form the relation @xmath55 for the isospin ( and spin ) transition operators and the coupling constant ratio @xmath56",
    "have been used .",

    "fig.1 shows on the right also a diagram with a @xmath9-contact vertex which arises from an additional direct coupling of the pion to the @xmath0-isobar .",
    "summing over the six permutations of the isospin - indices @xmath61 the corresponding transition matrix - element reads : @xmath62 where @xmath63 denote outgoing pion - momenta . in order to fix the @xmath64-vertex we use the coupling constant ratio @xmath65 of the quark - model .",
    "furthermore , the relation for the isospin ( transition ) operators , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the @xmath68 @xmath1-isospin matrices , has been employed together with an analogous relation for the spin ( transition ) operators .",
    "-isobars . ]",
    "while the decomposition into isoscalar and isovector contributions is obvious from the isospin factor @xmath69 of a @xmath9-exchange diagram , a certain technique is needed in order to separate the + spin - spin and tensor - like components .",
    "first , one removes from a spin - dependent expression of the form @xmath70 the pauli - matrices @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the spin - spin part im@xmath73 is then obtained by con- tracting the lorentz - tensor @xmath74 with the projector @xmath75 , and the combination im@xmath76 including the tensor part follows finally by contracting @xmath74 with the projector @xmath77 .",
    "after these manipulations the relevant expressions are given in terms of lorentz - scalars , which can be easily translated from the @xmath78-channel ( @xmath79 ) into the @xmath43-channel ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "in this section , we present the analytical expressions for the spectral - functions pertaining to the isoscalar and isovector central , spin - spin and tensor nn - potentials in momentum - space .",
