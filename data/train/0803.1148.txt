    "@xmath8 is in fact first introduced by kazhdan and lusztig in @xcite as a purely combinatorial tool to the theory of primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebras of semisimple complex lie algebras . in this case the combinatorial characterizations of cells are well known , where knuth ( or plactic ) relations appears as the mediating tool .",
    "namely , when @xmath2 is type @xmath9 then each right ( left ) cell corresponds to the plactic ( respectively coplactic ) class of some standard young tableau whereas each two - sided cell consists of those permutations which lie in the plactic classes of tableaux of the same shape .",
    "this characterizations depends on joseph s classification of primitive ideals in type a , where knuth ( plactic ) relations play a crucial role .    on the types b ,",
    "c and d , on the other hand the emerging combinatorial objects are standard domino tableaux .",
    "the connection is first revealed in the work of barbash and vogan @xcite where they provide necessary conditions for the characterizations of primitive ideals through an algorithm which uses the palindrome representations of signed permutations in order to assign to every signed permutations @xmath10 a pair of same shape standard @xmath0-domino tableaux @xmath11 bijectively , for @xmath12 or @xmath13 . meanwhile , an analog of knuth relations provided by joseph in @xcite established the sufficient conditions . on the other hand garfinkle @xcite finalized classification problem for these types by showing through her two algorithms on domino tableaux that these two sets of relations are in fact equivalent .",
    "her first algorithm assigns any signed permutation to a pair of same shape standard @xmath0-domino tableaux for @xmath0 equals to @xmath14 or @xmath15 and the second defines and equivalence relation between domino tableaux through the notion of _ open cycles_. we want to remark that the extension of garfinkle and barbash - vogan algorithm for larger @xmath0 is given in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",

    "furthermore , pietraho @xcite adopts garfinkle s notion of cycles to extend it for any positive integer @xmath0 and he shows that the set of signed permutations whose insertion @xmath0 or @xmath30-domino tableau are the same is equivalent to the set of signed permutations whose insertion @xmath0-domino tableaux are equivalent through the notion of open cycles .    on the other hand , in order to establish the proofs of these conjecture one definitely needs the plactic relations between signed permutations which determines when the insertion @xmath0-domino tableaux of two signed permutations are the same or equivalent through the notion of open cycles .",
