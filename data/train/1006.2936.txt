    "many of the theoretical and phenomenological analyses of qcd processes rely upon the factorization of the underlying dynamics into a short - distance dominated part , amenable to qcd perturbation theory , and a large - distance part that has to be taken from experiment or be determined by nonperturbative methods . among such processes , the pion form factors ( electromagnetic and transition ) play the role of a theoretical laboratory to test various ideas and techniques .",

    "it turns out that the only nonperturbative content in this sr is mainly defined by the scalar quark condensate .",
    "the nonperturbative contribution is proportional to the second inverse moment ( [ eq:4qterm ] ) of the distribution @xmath23 of the vacuum - quark virtualities and is defined by the behavior of the quark condensate at large and moderate distances between the vacuum quarks .",

    "the integral derivative of the pion da , based on a new sr derived in this work , remains smaller than the asymptotic value and overlaps with the range of values determined with the bms bunch of pion das , while there is no agreement with the cz da and the flat - type models considered .",
    "the same conclusions can be drawn also for the usual derivative of the pion da , which follows from the differential sr ( [ eq : dpiondaqcdsr ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that employing the integral and the differential sum rules , we found that the leading - order qcd sum rules ( [ eq : piondaqcdsr ] ) , which employ the minimal gaussian model for the nonlocal condensates , can not be satisfied by flat - type pion distribution amplitudes .    given that an increasing behavior of the scaled pion - photon transition form factor can only be achieved with flat - type pion das , the independent experimental confirmation of this effect , e.g. , by the belle collaboration , becomes extremely crucial for our theoretical understanding of basic qcd exclusive processes .",
