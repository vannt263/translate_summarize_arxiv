    "polar diatomic molecules are promising complex systems @xcite in search of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron .",
    "the measurement of a non - zero permanent molecular edm and the establishment of its origin in fundamental charge ( @xmath10 ) and spatial parity ( @xmath0 ) violating interactions @xcite , for example inducing an electron edm , would be a signature of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "the thorium monoxide ( tho ) molecule has been found to be one of the most interesting candidates in this quest @xcite , among other aspects due to its very large internal effective electric field @xmath11 on unpaired electrons @xcite .",
    "recently , the acme collaboration reported an order of magnitude smaller upper bound to the electron edm interaction constant , @xmath12 cm , obtained from a spin - precession measurement on a pulse of tho molecules @xcite .",
    "this upper bound for @xmath13 is principally determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : de_master ] ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an upper bound to a measured transition energy and @xmath11 is the internal electric field at the position of the electron , giving rise to a dipolar interaction with the electron s postulated edm .",
    "@xmath11 can not be measured experimentally but has to be determined from a theoretical electronic - structure calculation on the respective molecule in the respective quantum state . on the one hand , large @xmath11 is a selection criterion for systems with a large edm interaction and therefore holding promise for the electron edm to actually be found .",
    "second , an accurate value of @xmath11 is required for reliably constraining the parameter ranges of new physics models going beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "great care is taken in assessing and minimizing errors in the determination of @xmath15 .",
    "it is obvious that the same care should be taken in the theoretical assessment of the effective electric field @xmath11 .",
    "previous calculations of @xmath11 in the relevant `` science '' state @xmath2 , arising mainly from the configuration @xmath16 ( th@xmath17 o@xmath18 ) , have been reported by meyer et al .",
    "@xcite and skripnikov et al .",
    "@xcite . in the former @xcite @xmath19 $ ] has been obtained based on a semi - empirical model calculation which in part employs non - relativistic approximations and a very limited set of electronic configurations .",
    "the latter study @xcite determines @xmath20 $ ] by means of a two - component relativistic single - reference coupled cluster ( cc ) approach .",
    "the work presented in this paper is aimed at an accurate determination of @xmath11 in the @xmath2 excited state of the tho molecule , along with a clarification of which physical aspects play the decisive role in obtaining this quantity reliably .",
    "in addition , we investigate the excitation energy of the @xmath2 state and the parallel hyperfine coupling constant which is regarded as a measure of the quality of molecular wavefunctions employed in the determination of relativistic edm enhancement factors .",
    "the potential energy due to the electron edm interaction in the molecule is determined as an expectation value @xcite over the one - body hamiltonian @xmath21 as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of electrons , @xmath24 are the standard dirac matrices , @xmath13 is the electron edm interaction constant , @xmath25 with @xmath26 the vector of pauli spin matrices , and @xmath27 is the electric field at the position of an electron ( @xmath28 ) . the wavefunction @xmath29 is determined from relativistic 4-component configuration interaction ( ci ) theory @xcite for the @xmath30 first electronically excited state of the tho molecule , using the all - electron dirac - coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "details on the implementation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hedm : kinerg ] ) can be found in reference .",
    "the optimized coefficients in the linear expansion of @xmath29 in the basis of slater determinants over 4-component dirac spinors contain the approximate effects of electron correlations among the electrons explicitly treated in the ci expansion .",
    "since the magnetic vector potential @xmath31 due to the magnetic moment @xmath32 of a nucleus @xmath33 at the position @xmath34 of an electron in an atom is @xcite @xmath35 we can derive the parallel magnetic hyperfine interaction constant @xmath8 as the @xmath36 projection of the expectation value of the corresponding perturbative hamiltonian in dirac theory @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the nuclear spin quantum number , @xmath39 is a hamiltonian - form dirac matrix for particle @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the number of electrons .",
    "again , we evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : aparallel ] ) over the ci wavefunction for the state @xmath30 .",
    "for the determination of the nuclear hyperfine coupling constant we use the thorium isotope @xmath42 for which the nuclear magnetic moment has been determined to be @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "its nuclear spin quantum number is @xmath44 . in all calculations",
    "the speed of light was set to 137.0359998 a.u .",
    "fully uncontracted atomic gaussian basis sets of double-@xmath45 , triple-@xmath45 and quadruple-@xmath45 quality were used for the description of electronic shells . for thorium we used dyall s basis sets @xcite and for oxygen the dunning cc - pvnz - dk sets @xcite with @xmath46 , as well as the aug - cc - pvtz - dk set @xcite . for thorium",
    "all @xmath47 correlating exponents were added to the basic n - tuple-@xmath45 sets , amounting to \\{@xmath48 } uncontracted functions in case of double-@xmath45 ( in the following abbreviated as vdz ) , \\{@xmath49 } in the case of triple-@xmath45 ( vtz ) and \\{@xmath50 } in the case of quadruple-@xmath45 ( vqz ) , respectively .",
    "the latter set in addition contains all @xmath51 correlating exponents .",
    "molecular calculations were carried out with a modified local version of the ` dirac11 ` program package @xcite .",
    "optimized molecular spinors have been obtained using the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian and all - electron four - component hartree - fock calculations . the basic model used for these open - shell calculations",
    "is based on an average - of - configuration fock operator for two electrons in the th ( @xmath52 ) kramers pairs with all other ( @xmath53 ) electrons restricted to closed shells .",
    "this model , called ( av.2in3 ) , denoting an averaging with 2 electrons in 3 kramers pairs in the following , is appropriate for the region close to the equilibrium bond distance of the molecule where the dominant configurations correspond to the system th@xmath17 o@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the open - shell averaging ensures a balanced description of the low - lying electronic states of interest in this study . in a few models using the smallest basis set ( double-@xmath45 ) the @xmath54 and @xmath55 shells of th",
    "were included due to partial mixing with the th @xmath56 shell , defining ( av.2in9 ) .",
    "for the larger basis sets we have restricted the open - shell averaging to ( av.2in3 ) .    we exploit a generalized active space ( gas ) concept for defining ci wavefunctions of varying quality .",
    "figure [ fig : tho_gas ] shows the partitioning of the space of kramers - paired spinors into seven subspaces , five of which are active for excitations . based on this     generalized active space models for tho ci wavefunctions .",
    "the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 are defined in the text and determine the occupation constraints of the subspaces of kramers - paired spinors .",
    "the molecular spinors are denoted according to their principal atomic character .",
    "the space with @xmath59 virtual kramers pairs ( for vtz basis sets ) is comprised by all canonical dchf orbitals below an energy of @xmath60 e@xmath61 .",
    ", width=283 ]    partitioning and four parameters ( @xmath62 ) which define the accumulated occupation constraints of the subspaces , we choose four different ci wavefunction models for our calculations :    [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     was computationally feasible for the smallest employed basis sets , vdz .",
    "again , the inclusion of higher excitations leads to the characteristic drop in @xmath63 , here by @xmath64 @xmath65 $ ] ( mr@xmath66-cisdt(@xmath67 ) relative to mr@xmath66-cisd(@xmath67 ) ) .",
    "interestingly , nearly the same decrease is observed when configurations including three particles in the virtual space , @xmath68 , are excluded from the ci expansion , model mr@xmath69-cisd(@xmath67 ) , and the higher excitations are restricted to a subset involving additional @xmath70-type spinors , i.e. , configurations of the type @xmath71 .",
    "we note that the @xmath2 excitation energy behaves in very similar way , with higher excitations involving the enlarged active spinor space playing the major role and increasing the excitation energy markedly ( the overshooting value for mr@xmath69-cisd(@xmath67 ) is due to basis set incompleteness , as the results in table [ tab : tho : basis ] confirm ) . also for @xmath8 we observe a notable dependence on higher excitations in the wavefunction , to a large degree covered by the augmentation of the active spinor space .",
    "again , the most elaborate result of skripnikov et al .",
    "( @xmath72 [ mhz ] in our units ) is very close to our result using the insufficient active spinor space ( @xmath73 [ mhz ] ) .",
    "apparently , it is configurations involving excitations into the augmenting active space spinors , combined with correlation excitations into the virtual space that are of major importance for obtaining an accurate value for @xmath63 , and not the higher excitations such as @xmath68 provided by the coupled cluster ( cc ) model of skripnikov et al .",
    "the cc model of the latter authors , in turn , is a standard single - reference cc expansion which is applied to the property of an electronically excited state which clearly exhibits a significant multi - reference character , as our results demonstrate . in addition , skripnikov et al .",
    "use ground - state @xmath74 spinors and the same state as the fermi vacuum for the cc expansion which biases the wavefunction towards this ground state .",
    "this is confirmed by the too high excitation energy of the @xmath2 state obtained by those authors ( @xmath75 ) as compared to the experimental value of @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast to this result , our best model vtz / mr@xmath77-cisd(@xmath67 ) which is in addition based on configuration - averaged spinors yields an excitation energy in much better agreement with the experimental value , and , furthermore , shows that the adequate description of all relevant physical effects results in a value of @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath5% smaller than the earlier prediction of skripnikov et al .",
    "by means of a careful study of effects due to basis sets , dynamic electron correlation , and active spinor spaces within a rigorously relativistic all - electron four - component formalism , we have determined the edm effective electric field for the @xmath2 first electronically excited state at the experimental internuclear distance for the tho molecular ground state .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath3 $ ] with an estimated error bar of @xmath4% and @xmath5% smaller than the result previously reported by others @xcite . with the same wavefunction model we have obtained an excitation energy for the @xmath2 state of t@xmath78 = @xmath79 , in excellent agreement with the experimental result which confirms the quality of the molecular wavefunctions employed in the present study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 violating effects in tho .",
    "the magnetic hyperfine interaction constant is obtained to @xmath9 [ mhz ] using our most reliable wavefunction model .",
    "our detailed analysis shows that the tho @xmath2 state has a strong multi - reference nature which must be adequately accounted for in electronic - structure theoretical treatments .",
    "our result for @xmath63 has consequences for the recently determined upper bound to the electron edm interaction constant of @xmath12 cm @xcite .",
    "this upper bound has been obtained based on @xmath80 $ ] @xcite . due to",
    "( [ eq : de_master ] ) a @xmath5% smaller value for @xmath63 requires a corresponding adjustment of the upper bound for @xmath13 to a larger value .",
    "consequently , the electron edm constraint to models extending the standard model of elementary particles is somewhat attenuated .    in ongoing work",
    "we are studying potential energy curves for tho along with dipole and transition dipole moments for relevant molecular electronic states .",
    "furthermore , we are continuing with the implementation of further operators of importance in the search for @xmath0 and @xmath1 violating effects in the universe , in particular the scalar - pseudoscalar @xmath0,@xmath1-odd electron - nucleon interaction .",
