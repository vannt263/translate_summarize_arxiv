    "to understand how galaxies form and evolve , we need to study their stellar populations as they are like fossils where the different formation and evolutionary processes are registered .",
    "since stars are not resolved for distant stellar populations , one relies upon intergrated colors and spectra to obtain their physical parameters , such as ages or metallicities .",
    "however the integrated light of galaxies suffers the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy , making a galaxy to look redder because it is older or more metal rich ( e.g , ) .",
    "unlike colors , spectroscopic absorption line - strength indices are more promising at breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy , but even the most popular age indicator , i.e. , the lick h@xmath0 index ( hereafter , h@xmath3 ) , does show a significant dependance on metallicity , particularly for old stellar populations @xcite . despite the fact that other age indicators based on h@xmath4 feature have shown a larger sensitivity to age than h@xmath3 index , their signal - to - noise requirements are extremely high or their dependence on spectral resolution and velocity dispersion make them very difficult to apply for a large variety of data and targets @xcite .",
    "balmer lines are commonly used as age indicators , although they are not totally immune to metallicity effects for integrated stellar populations . in order to cope with the fact that h@xmath0 can be filled in with nebular emission @xcite ,",
    "indicators based on higher order balmer lines ( h@xmath5 , h@xmath4 ) have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the major drawback of these index definitions based on the h@xmath5 and h@xmath4 features is that they have been shown to be significantly more sensitive to the total metallicity and [ @xmath2/fe ] ratio than h@xmath3 . nowadays",
    "the developement of techniques where stellar and ionized - gas contributions to the galactic spectra are simultaneously described allow us to decouple nebular emission from the absorption features ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such procedures make it possible to explote the potential of h@xmath0 feature as an age indicator , even when gas emission is present .    plotting h@xmath0 index versus a metallicity indicator , measured on a set of ssp spectra of different ages and metallicities , provides a diagnostic diagram that allows us to partially lift the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "however it has been shown the disadvantage of using h@xmath3 versus various metallicity indicators for measuring mean luminosity weighted ages of early - type galaxies due to the fact that the resulting model grids are not fully orthogonal .",
    "indeed this method leads to younger age estimates when h@xmath3 is plotted versus mg@xmath6 than when is plotted versus an fe index if a galaxy is [ mg / fe ] overabundant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however a virtually orthogonal model grid is obtained when h@xmath3 is replaced by h@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the very high s / n required for measuring this index ( s /",
    "n (  ) @xmath8 150 ) limits its applicability to nearby and bright objects for which such spectra can be obtained .",
    "a more popular approach for obtaining consistent age estimates requires the use of models that specifically take into account the non scaled - solar elements ratios and the simultaneous measurement of several metal lines to constrain the [ @xmath2/fe ] ratio . however , the obtained results might depend on the details of modelling and on the particular element partition employed .",
    "furhermore the method is restricted to the use of the lick / ids system of indices .    in this paper , we explore , in a systematic manner , different index definitions for the h@xmath0 feature to find a new h@xmath0 indicator that is virtually insensitive to metallicity , which does not require particularly high s / n . in section 2 we describe the optimization procedure developed to find the new h@xmath0 indicator , which makes use of a ssp library of seds at moderately high resolution . in section 3",
    "we introduce the new h@xmath0 index definition and in section 4 we tackle its main characteristics . in section 5",
    "we test the reliability of this index on real data . finally our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "in the lick system @xcite , an index is defined in terms of a central bandpass enclosing the feature bracketed by two pseudocontinuum bandpasses at either side of the feature ( blue and red ) .",
    "once the average fluxes in the pseudocontinua are obtained , a line is drawn between their midpoints to represent the continuum of the central feature bandpass allowing to define an index as a pseudoequivalent width .    the standard lick",
    "/ ids system of indices was defined on the basis of a stellar spectral library that were not flux - calibrated and had a resolution @xmath9 8.4  fwhm ( three times lower than achieved in modern galaxy surveys , such as sdss ) .",
    "furthermore , the lick / ids spectral resolution is varying with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the natural resolution of a galaxy spectrum is given by the convolution of the employed instrumental resolution with the velocity broadening due to galaxy dynamics .",
    "therefore to apply any model predictions based on the lick / ids system we need to smooth higher resolution spectra of galaxies with velocity dispersion values lower than that corresponding to the lick / ids system to match its resolution ( i.e. @xmath11 ) . furthermore to apply these model predictions to higher velocity dispersion galaxies we also need to correct index measurements back to the resolution of the lick / ids system ( an uncertain method that usually requires observing a set of reference lick stars .",
    "alternatively , we prefer to use here ssp seds at higher resolution that allow us to measure absorption line indices directly on the model spectra once smoothed to match galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "this allows a direct comparison to the index values measured on the galaxy spectrum .",
    "this approach is advantageous for all stellar population systems , no matter its velocity dispersion nor its instrumental resolution .",
    "we explote here the advantadge of the ssp seds to derive new indices or to redefine previous ones , rather than employing stellar spectra or polynomial fitting functions that relate the strengths of the absorption lines to stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "this new generation of stellar population synthesis models allows us to perfom such analysis directly on the ssp spectra , allowing us to understand how sensitive to the physical parameters of the stellar populations a trial index definition is , thus avoiding the intermediate step of modeling this index for individual stars .",
    "here we accomplish this approach by using the library of single - age , single - metallicity stellar population model spectra of @xcite ( hereafter v99 ) and its recent extension @xcite ( v07 ) on the basis of the stellar library miles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that miles is characterized by an unprecedented stellar atmospheric parameter coverage @xcite allows predicting scaled - solar seds for old and intermediate ages with metallicities @xmath12 \\leq + 0.2 $ ] for the full optical spectral range ( 3540 - 7410  ) .",
    "the use of ssp seds to define new indicators does not only allow us to optimize them to be sensitive to the main population parameters such as age or metallicity , but also to minimize their sensitivity , for example , to the instrumental resolution or s / n requirements .",
    "this is possible as we can simulate spectra of stellar populations for different s / n and/or resolution ( or velocity dispersion ) values .",
    "furthermore with these ssp spectra it is straightforward to simulate and analyze the effects of radial velocity ( or rotation curve ) , spectrum shape and dust extinction on each trial index definition .    for finding a new h@xmath0 indicator",
    "we have adopted a lick style index definition , which consists of three bandpasses ( feature and two pseudocontinua ) .",
    "we then change the position of these bandpasses or modify their widths until optimizing its sensitivity to a given parameter .",
    "note that there are alternative approaches for defining indices such as those of the rose system @xcite , which are defined as the ratio between the intensity of the central peak of two spectral features .",
    "other index definitions are for example the _ generic indices _ @xcite or those considered pseudo - colors , e.g. d4000 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to define a new index based on h@xmath0 feature suitable for obtaining accurate age estimates .",
    "we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of this feature in order to obtain an index that is virtually insensitive to the total metallicity , with great stability against the smearing of this feature due to galaxy velocity dispersion ( or instrumental resolution ) and with as lower s / n requirement as possible . our method to derive an optimized h@xmath0 index definition",
    "developes a multicriteria analysis to evaluate the above requirements for each trial index definition",
    ".      our primary criterion is obtaining an index definition for the h@xmath0 feature that maximizes our ability to measure ages . to investigate whether metallicity effects can be decreased in the h@xmath0 feature , we have generalized the sensitivity parameter defined in @xcite ( see in there footnote 4 ) :    @xmath13})_{age } ) } { ( \\frac{1}{i_{i}})((\\frac{\\partial i_{i}}{\\partial log(age)})_{[m / h ] } ) } \\big]^{2}}}{n}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 runs for ssp models with ages older than 5 gyr and -0.7 @xmath15 \\leq$ ] + 0.2 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the index value measured on the @xmath14 ssp model for a given index definition and @xmath18 is the number of employed ssps .",
    "metallicity indicators should provide values above 1 , whereas the value for an age indicator should tend to 0 .",
    "-1    among the sistematically - generated configuration of bandpasses , our method consists in choosing the ones that provide mininum values for the @xmath19 parameter .",
    "note that the choice of bandpasses that minimazes @xmath19 should not depend on the stellar population synthesis models in use .",
    "the parameter space where @xmath19 is minimized covers the ages and metallicities for most early - type galaxies @xcite and , for the h@xmath0 case , represents the parameter subspace where the age sensitivity is lower and where the metallicity has the larger effects . in other words , we are optimizing our indicator to be sensitive to the age for the worst possible cases .",
    "one of the metioned advantages of using the ssp seds at higher resolution is that it is straightforward to study the effects of the velocity dispersion ( or resolution ) on a given line index definition .",
    "the models can be smoothed to different levels , allowing us to evaluate its stability to @xmath20 variations .",
    "note that @xmath20 effects might be significant for some index definitions that already are optimal according to the @xmath19 parameter , as a sufficiently small @xmath20 variation might decrease the obtained age sensitivities . to parametrize this effect",
    ", we calculate the partial derivative of the index versus @xmath20 for a solar metallicity ssp model of 10gyr at @xmath21 :    @xmath22}=0.0 , t=10\\,gyr \\arrowvert_{\\sigma = 150 kms^{-1}}}\\ ] ]    in a multicriteria analysis , the parameters that have been taken into account are not assigned the same weight , as our main purpose is to optimize our age resolving power .",
    "if we were to obtain an index definition that provides the largest @xmath20-stability , we would not have retained those definitions providing the better age disentangling sensitivity .",
    "therefore we have discarded index definitions with @xmath23 within the subset of solutions for which the @xmath19 parameter was optimized .",
    "this is equivalent to a maximum variation of 10% when comparing the index value at the nominal resolution of the models and at @xmath24 .",

    "obviuously no index definition is appropriate if the required s / n is extremely high .",
    "however , achieving minimum index errors does not imply a mininum age uncertainty if the age indicator is not totally insensitive to metallicity effects .",
    "in fact , the age - metallicity degeneracy and the uncertainity of age derived from index errors are tightly correlated @xcite .",
    "we consider that the indicator depends solely on age , so that the uncertanity on measuring this parameter comes mostly from photon noise .",
    "aiming at obtaining index definitions that minimize the s / n requirement , we define @xmath27 $ ] as the index error required to achieve a precission of 2.5gyr on deriving the age for a a 10gyr and solar metallicity model .",

    "table [ table1 ] lists the limiting wavelength of the bandpasses for the h@xmath3 and h@xmath1 indices .",
    "the bandpasses of two indices are shown in figure [ figure1 ] . although farther along we show plots and results obtained on the basis of v07 , virtually identical results are achieved with v99 models .",
    "h@xmath3 shows little sensitivity to the metallicity , as no strong metallic lines are included in the wavelength range of the index definition .",
    "however this dependence is not negligible as inferred from the non - orthogonal model grids resulting when this index is plotted versus the metallicity indicator [ mgfe ] , @xcite .",
    "furthermore this prevents us to derive a unique age , when different metallicity indicators are used if the analyzed galaxies do not have scaled - solar abundance patterns , particularly for old galaxies ( see , for example , their figure [ figure7 ] ) .",
    "metallic lines within h@xmath0 are mainly dominated by mg via mgh absorption @xcite , ti @xcite and cr at @xmath9 4885  .",
    "h@xmath1 index definition avoids the spectral range covering those metallic lines as the red - pseudocontinuum is shifted toward the red , whereas the blue - pseudocontinuum is narrower to decrease the metallicity dependency .",
    "however , other metallicity variations affect the h@xmath3 central bandpass via a ti line at 4871 and the h@xmath0 line at @xmath9 4862  .",
    "note that the depth of both lines show an opposed behaviour against metallicity : the higher the metallicity , the larger is the strength of the ti line and the smaller the h@xmath0 line .",
    "these opposed responses at increasing metallicity are not balanced by each other within h@xmath3 index definition .",
    "this index compesates this effect in part by incorporating a metallicity dependence on the red - pseudocontinuum .",
    "in fact , it overcompensates the global effect leading to a higher metallicity sensitivity .",
    "h@xmath1 extends to the blue the blue - wing of the central bandpass to introduce the required metallicity dependence , thus avoiding to introduce cr in the red - pseudocontinnuum , which causes the variation of h@xmath3 with the metallicity ( figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows h@xmath3 and h@xmath1 index values as a function of the age of the ssp for different metallicities , at the nominal resolution of the models ( left ) and at 225 kms@xmath28 ( right ) 5000  ] the plot shows how h@xmath1 is significatly less sensitive to the metallicity than h@xmath3 as the lines representing models of different metallicities lay almost on the same curve , particularly for the higher metallicities ( i.e. [ m / h]@xmath29 -0.7 ) .",

    "in this section we fully characterize h@xmath1 index and discuss its major uncertainties with several aspects that might influence its ability as an age indicator .",

    "the black horizontal dotted line represents the measurement error required to distinguish 2.5gyr for a 10gyr solar metallicity ssp model , i.e. , the accuracy we have imposed during our process of finding the new h@xmath1 index . for a 1gyr scaled - solar model ( light grey lines ) , h@xmath3 @xmath9 4.3  and h@xmath1 @xmath9 5.5 , it corresponds to 1% for h@xmath1 and 0.2% for h@xmath3 , in the two cases for a extreme dust extintion . for a 13gyr model ( black lines ) , h@xmath3 @xmath9 1.8 and h@xmath1 @xmath9 3  , it means 0.3% for h@xmath1 , since @xmath64 @xmath9 0.01  and 0.6% for h@xmath3 .",
    "as expected , the effect of extinction is larger in h@xmath1 than in h@xmath3 , since the involved wavelength coverage is larger .",
    "however , the obtained effects are lower than the minimum index errors associated to the noise ( figure [ figure6 ] ) , when extinction has been incorporated on top of the ssp seds .",
    "it is worth noting than although dust extintion was not considered as a parameter for the index definition proccess , it is not rejecting a posteriori the obtained index .",
    "estimating the mean luminosity - weighted age of an early - type galaxy represents a major step for constraining its star formation history . in this section",
    "we probe the h@xmath1 as an age - dating indicator in real data .",
    "we apply this index to milky way globular clusters and to prototype early - type galaxies for which extremely high quality spectra are available .",
    "globular clusters are ideal laboratories to test the ssp models as they can be considered as stellar populations formed in a single and homogenous process . milky way globular clusters allow us to check the consistency of the h@xmath1 age estimates as it is possible to obtain independent age / metallicity values from detailed color - magnitud diagram ( cmd ) analyses .",
    "figure [ figure10 ] shows the h@xmath3 and h@xmath1 indices measured on the milky way cluster sample of @xcite versus the cmd - derived metallicities .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values are taken from @xcite ( the 2003 version of the mcmaster catalog ) .",
    "we obtain for the h@xmath3 sequence a spearman rank coefficient value of -0.89 , whereas for h@xmath1 we obtain -0.70 , indicating a milder anti - correlation for the latter .",
    "the slope of a linear fitting is -0.71 dex /  for h@xmath3 and -0.36 dex /  for h@xmath1 .",
    "note that the fit for h@xmath1 is virtually flat for [ fe / h]@xmath8 - 1.0 .",
    "although we have shown in the previous section that h@xmath1 is particularly optimized for higher metallicities ( [ m / h]@xmath29 - 0.7 ) , these results confirm the lower metallicity dependence of h@xmath1 with respect to h@xmath3 on the basis of real data , without the use of models , for all metallicities .",
    "figure [ figure7 ] shows h@xmath1 and three age - dating indices versus the mean metallicity indicator [ mgfe ] for the same cluster sample .",
    "we see that the stellar clusters fall at the bottom of all these plots , indicating very old ages .",
    "in fact for many cases we obtain ages that are larger than the oldest models ( i.e. older than the age of the universe ) .",
    "these plots show the well known model zero - point problem affecting the spectroscopic age determinations from the balmer line indices ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite using multi - index @xmath66 minimization technique analized two milky way globular cluster samples ( the schiavon s data used here and puzia et al . 2002 ) to test the age estimates obtained with three different sets of updated models ( thomas et al .",
    "2004 , lee & worthey 2005 and our models ) .",
    "although the ages inferred on the basis of their multi - index method are in agreement with the cmd - derived ages , their figure 2 shows basically the same result , i.e. the observed h@xmath0 values fall below the model grids for the three models . nonetheless the large age values is a result that is common to all the balmer line - strength index definitions shown in figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "however there are other works , working in the lick / ids system , in which this offset is not seen , e.g. thomas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) where these models are used to fit the puzia et al.s data ( both , the models and the data , also employed in @xcite ) .",
    "note also that according to the @xmath54 value listed in table [ table3 ] for h@xmath1 this offset is clearly minimized when employing models based on the library . as this problem does not affect the relative age / metallicity sensitivities of the h@xmath0 index definitions used here we refer the interested reader to the above papers for further details on this issue .    in the h@xmath1 plot",
    "we are able to distinguish two populations of clusters for [ mgfe ] @xmath8 1.5  , which can also be seen in figure [ figure10 ] . with this evidence in our hands",
    "we can identify these two cluster populations in the h@xmath3 plot as well .",
    "however the two cluster populations can not be distinguished in the remaining two panels of figure [ figure7 ] , which include lower age - sensitivity indices .",
    "therefore this intriguing feature becomes more evident as the metallicity dependance of the balmer index definition has been significantly minimized . an extensive study devoted to understand the origin of this feature",
    "is presented in @xcite . in this study",
    "we compare the cmds of these clusters and discuss among other aspects , the effects of the horizontal branch morphology and the blue stragglers on the integrated h@xmath0 indices . in that paper",
    "we convincingly show that the latter is directly linked to the observed two age - population feature and that this feature is not driven by the zero - point problem .",
