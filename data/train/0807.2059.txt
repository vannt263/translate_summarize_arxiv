    "the origin of the optical / uv fe emission has been hotly debated for more than two decades .",
    "thousands of fe emission lines blend together to form a pseudo - continuum , which , when combined with balmer continuum emission , results in the `` small blue bump '' around 3000   @xcite .",
    "previously , theoretical calculations of photoionized clouds in the blr encountered difficulties reproducing the observed strength of strong fe ii  emission , prompting many authors to propose additional physical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "recently , a more sophisticated calculation by @xcite revealed that the predicted shape and ew of the 22002800  fe ii  uv bump can only be made consistent with observed values if either microturbulence of hundreds of @xmath2or another collisionally excited component is included in the model .    despite its significance ,",
    "current observations of fe ii  emission provide poor constraints on its origin .",
    "some studies suggest that fe ii  emission originates from the same region as the other broad emission lines .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite observed similar line widths and profiles for fe ii  and @xmath4 , and @xcite found that both fe ii  emission and the balmer continuum have comparable variation amplitudes .",
    "but there is a growing debate on this issue .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath4  is systematically broader than fe ii  for sources with @xmath5  @xmath6 4000 @xmath2 .",
    "recent studies of fe ii  emission variability have shown that fe ii  emission responds to variations in continuum flux but that the variability amplitude of fe ii  is not the same as that of h@xmath3   ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the upper limit on the time lag between fe ii  emission and the continuum exceeds the lag of any other observed emission lines obtained @xcite .",
    "this implies that fe ii  may be emitted from further out in the blr than any other broad emission line .",
    "@xcite suggested that fe ii  may be produced from a region between the blr and the dust sublimation radius .",
    "the study of @xcite , based on measurements of the o i and ca ii emission lines , supports the notion that fe ii  emerges from the outer portion of the blr . in a recent three - dimensional spectroscopic study of mrk 493",
    ", @xcite found that the fe ii  emission region is extensive and that the line width of fe ii  is only 1/3 of that of @xmath4 , leading them to suggest that fe ii  emission originates in an intermediate - line region .",
    "if these findings can be confirmed , fe ii  emission can be a probe of the intermediate - line region , which may be the transition from the torus to the blr and accretion disk .",
    "quasar emission lines often exhibit considerable velocity shifts with respect to each other .",
    "however , the relative velocity of fe ii  emission with respect to other lines has not been well studied , especially in systematically for a large sample of objects ( only a few measurements of individual sources have been published ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , almost all broad quasar emission lines show blueward velocity shifts @xcite , with the exception of mg ii  ( no shift ; @xcite ) and h@xmath3  ( redward shift in some studies ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the spectra of quasars from uv to optical wavelengths are remarkably similar to each other .",
    "the quasar composite spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is characterized by a featureless continuum and a plethora of broad and narrow emission lines . in the luminosity range of interest to us here , very little , if any , starlight is observed , so we can ignore the host galaxy contribution to the spectrum .",
    "the validity of this simplification can be tested from our spectral fitting ",
    "nearly all of the sources in the sample can be well fitted without a host galaxy component .",
    "the procedure of our spectral fitting algorithm is as follows .",
    "we begin by deredshifting the spectrum after correcting for galactic extinction .",
    "then , the continuum is decomposed into three components : ( 1 ) a single power law , ( 2 ) balmer continuum emission ( supplemented with high - order balmer emission lines ) , and ( 3 ) a pseudo - continuum due to blended fe emission .",
    "we subtract this continuum model to obtain a pure emission - line spectrum , which is then fitted to derive parameters for the emission lines .",
    "the measurement of fe emission is strongly affected by the uncertainty in the determination of the continuum level . since there are almost no `` pure '' continuum windows , a simultaneous fit should be performed to decouple the fe emission from the featureless continuum , rather than fitting the two independently .",
    "[ tsuzuki et al . (",

    "we adopt the galactic extinction in the @xmath17 band listed in the sdss quasar catalog @xcite and change it to the @xmath18 band using the relation @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "then , we deredshift the extinction - corrected spectrum using the redshift provided by the sdss pipeline . this value of redshift is later refined using the line centroid of  @xmath145007 measured after continuum decomposition ( see  [ redshift ] ) .",
    "we model the continuum of the spectrum after galactic extinction and redshift correction ( hereinafter the corrected spectrum ) using three components : @xmath20 in total there are seven free parameters .",
    "the first term is the featureless power law @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the flux density at 5100   and @xmath23 is the spectral index .",
    "the second and third terms denote the balmer continuum and fe emission , respectively , which are described below .",
    "for the fe emission term , @xmath24 is the flux and @xmath25 is the shift velocity of fe ii .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the balmer continuum produced by a partially optically thick cloud with a uniform temperature can be expressed by @xmath26 for wavelengths shortward of the balmer edge ( @xmath27  ) .",
    "@xmath28 is the planck function at an electron temperature @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a normalization coefficient for the flux at @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the optical depth at @xmath14 expressed by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the optical depth at the balmer edge .",
    "there are two free parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath34 .",
    "following @xcite , we assume @xmath29 = 15,000 k.    at wavelengths @xmath35 , blended higher - order balmer lines give a smooth rise in the spectrum from @xmath364000   to the balmer edge @xcite .",

    "( this implies that the higher - order balmer lines also depend on @xmath30 and @xmath34 . ) in order to smooth the rise to the balmer edge , we assume that each line has a gaussian profile with fwhm = 8000 @xmath2 . in practice , none of the assumptions concerning the higher - order balmer lines actually impact our results because our fitting windows do not include this region ( see  [ contifit ] ) .",
    "@xcite first introduced the template - fitting method to treat fe emission in agns , using the fe spectrum of the narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy i  zw  1 ( @xmath39 ) to construct an fe ii  template . in most applications of this method ,",
    "the amount of velocity broadening applied to the template during spectral fitting is either solved as a free parameter or is fixed ( usually to the fwhm of broad h@xmath3 ) .",
    "but the fe template itself is not allowed to shift in velocity .",
    "we follow essentially the same template - fitting , but we explicitly allow the width and shift of fe ii  to be free parameters .",
    "we now describe the details of our algorithm .    considering the redshift range of our sample , we need both the uv and optical fe template for i  zw  1 . in the uv band ,",
    "we adopt the fe template of @xcite .",
    "note that their template is set to zero around the mg ii  line , which is unphysical .",
    "however , the mg ii  line is not the main focus of the present work , and for the purposes of this work we do not concern ourselves with this complication . in the optical , apart from the widely used template constructed by @xcite , some others are also available .",
    "for example , a template of any width can be constructed from the list of fe lines for i  zw  1 given by @xcite .",
    "we compared these two different templates and in the end chose the one from @xcite ( kindly provided by t. a. boroson ) because it gives smaller reduced @xmath11 .",
    "however , we have verified that the shift of fe emission , one of the main goals of this work , is actually not sensitive to the choice of template .",
    "the velocity shifts measured using either of the two template are consistent with each other .",
    "we combine the uv and optical templates to form a single template ( with a gap from 3100   to 3700  , which has no data ) and convolve it with a gaussian function : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the i zw 1 fe template , @xmath42 is a gaussian function with flux @xmath43 , width @xmath44 , and peak velocity shift @xmath45 .",
    "the convolution is done in logarithmic wavelength space because @xmath46 .",
    "the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ equ - conti ] ) can be calculated as follows .",
    "the flux of the fe emission , @xmath24 , is equal to @xmath43 multiplied by the flux of the template .",
    "the shift of the fe spectrum , @xmath25 , is simply @xmath45 .",
    "finally , the fwhm of the fe lines can be expressed as @xmath47 in the above algorithm , we assume that the fe emission in the uv and optical have the same width and velocity shift , and that the ratio of uv fe flux to optical fe flux is fixed to that of i  zw  1 .",
    "these assumptions help to reduce the number of free parameters , and seem appropriate given the s / n of the present sample . if we split the uv / optical template following @xcite to three major wavelength bands  uv ( 20003000  ) , small blue bump ( 30003500  ) , and optical ( 40006000 )the final results will be determined mainly by the optical fe emission .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "first , the small blue bump fe emission is outside of our fitting windows ( see  [ contifit ] ) .",
    "second , the spectra of most of the quasars in the sample either do not cover or only cover a very narrow segment of the uv fe emission wavelength range .",
    "third , the s / n of the uv band is lower than the optical band .",
    "thus , our measurements mainly trace the optical fe emission and are not very sensitive to uv fe emission .",
    "we consider each of the three assumptions in turn .",
    "the ratio of uv to optical fe flux has been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * and references therein ) .",
    "this ratio depends on the physical parameters of the clouds , such as the hydrogen density @xmath48 , the hydrogen - ionizing flux @xmath49 , the velocity of turbulence , and so forth .",
    "however , for physical conditions typical of quasars ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , models of fe emission indicate that there are large regions of parameter space where the ratio is roughly constant ( figs . 3 and 4 . in * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that adopting a single ratio of uv to optical fe flux ( fixed to that of i  zw  1 ) should be a reasonably good approximation .    the width of the uv fe lines is also not necessarily equal to that of the optical fe lines .",
    "many authors fix the width of the optical fe lines to the width of broad @xmath4 , while in the uv the width is fixed to that of mg ii(e.g .",
    "this procedure implicitly assumes that the optical fe lines and @xmath4  originate from the same region , and similarly that the uv fe lines follow mg ii .",
    "empirically , however , the width of @xmath4  is consistent with that of mg ii  @xcite ; the difference is only 0.05 dex on average @xcite .",
    "our results in  [ resultwidth ] also show this .",
    "thus , for the present purposes , it is safe to assume one single value for the width of the optical and uv fe lines .",
    "we leave the width as a free parameter , as has been done in many previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the velocity shift of the uv fe lines 100 @xmath2 .",
    "but considering the resolution of our spectra , assuming a single velocity shift is safe , both for the uv and optical . ]",
    "could be different from that of the optical lines if they arise from different regions .",
    "we use only the optical fe template and fit the continuum only in the optical band for testing .",
    "the resulting fe shifts change little , demonstrating that our measurements are mainly determined by the optical fe lines .",
    "thus , for our goal of studying the optical fe lines , assuming one single shift for the uv and optical fe lines is an adequate approximation .    it should be noted here that because of the two reasons mentioned above ( low s /",
    "n around uv fe lines and incomplete wavelength near ) , the present paper can not conclude whether the uv and optical fe ii  have a common origin .",

    "this pattern is reminiscent of that seen by @xcite , who found that the uv - optical continuum of nls1s , which have high @xmath77  and strong fe ii , is redder than that of regular agns .",
    "this is unexpected from standard accretion disk models , since a higher @xmath77  generally produces a hotter disk and thus a bluer continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    note that it is difficult to see the shifts of the fe ii  emission clearly in the composite spectra .",
    "for example , the peaks between @xmath151 and @xmath152   appear to remain unshifted .",
    "the reason is as follows . on the one hand , since both the shifts and widths of the fe ii  emission have a large scatter in each subsample , stacking the spectra effectively smooths the fe ii   emission . on the other hand , there are many narrow emission lines ( e.g. , line system n3 in @xcite ) that are weak in a single spectrum and have nearly no shift .",
    "stacking the spectra enhances these narrow features .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is that the wings of the h@xmath3  profile become progressively more ( red ) asymmetric when @xmath83  increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig - comhb ] ) .",
    "the inserted plot shows the difference spectra between composites b through e , using composite a as reference , to emphasize the profile changes .",
    "note the systematic migration of the red excess as @xmath83  increases .",
    "we do find some individual sources , similar to oq 208 @xcite , whose redshifted h@xmath3  component seems to be associated with fe ii  emission (  [ shifthb ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry in h@xmath3  has been studied by many authors .",
    "@xcite found that there are h@xmath3  red asymmetries at small @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite found that radio - loud agns show predominantly redshifted and red asymmetric h@xmath3  profiles : the larger the shift , the broader the line .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the fractional luminosity of the red part of the h@xmath3  line and found that it has a tendency to increase with decreasing fe ii / h@xmath3  ( see their table 3 ) . considering that @xmath83inversely correlates with @xmath110 , as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig - e1shift ] ,",
    "the finding here is consistent with theirs .",
    "one possible interpretation , discussed in  [ feorig ] , is that the h@xmath3  excess emerges from the same region that produces fe ii .",
    "a systematic study of this issue will be carried out in a future paper .",
    "in our sample , we find a class of sources whose h@xmath3  profile can be fitted well including an additional , substantially redshifted gaussian component .",
    "usually this additional component has a velocity width intermediate between that of the broad and narrow components .",
    "we call this the intermediate component .",
    "an interesting and possibly highly significant fact is that the width and velocity shift of this additional h@xmath3  component is consistent with those of the fe ii  emission .",
    "a prototype of this kind of sources is oq 208 ( mrk 668 ) , which was first studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that in oq 208 the fe ii  lines at 4924 and 5018   have the same peak displacement as the red peak of h@xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig - redhb ] shows the spectrum of sdss j094603.94 + 013923.6 , an example of a oq 208-like source .",
    "panel ( _ a _ ) shows the continuum decomposition , following the same convention as used in the top panel of figure [ fig - conti1 ] .",
    "panel ( _ b _ ) shows the emission - line spectrum after continuum subtraction .",
    "the red solid line is our fe ii  model .",
    "the blue dashed line marks the position of the peak of fe ii  @xmath144924 at zero velocity shift .",
    "the shift of the fe ii  spectrum is obvious .",
    "panel ( _ c _ ) illustrates the detailed fitting of the h@xmath3  and  emission lines .",
    "the profile of @xmath59  is fixed to that of .",
    "the two blue dashed lines mark the rest - frame wavelength of h@xmath3  and  @xmath145007 ; both @xmath59  and  share the same velocity . a prominent",
    ", intermediate - width redshifted component is clearly required to fit h@xmath3 .",
    "panel ( _ d _ ) shows the fit for  @xmath143727 , which also has the same redshift as .",
    "this means that this source is not an  `` blue outlier '' @xcite .",
    "table [ tab - redhb ] lists the fwhms and velocity shifts of fe ii , , , and each component of h@xmath3 .",
    "the velocity shifts are all with respect to . the width and velocity shift of the redshifted h@xmath3  component are consistent with those of fe ii  emission .",
    "the emission - line spectrum of sdss j094603.94 + 013923.6 can be divided into three systems : ( 1 ) h@xmath3 , , and  emission lines with narrow ( fwhm @xmath153 @xmath2 ) widths and no velocity shift ; ( 2 ) a normal `` broad '' h@xmath3  component with fwhm @xmath154 @xmath2 , approximately at rest with respect to the narrow lines ; and ( 3 ) fe ii   emission and h@xmath3  of intermediate width ( fwhm @xmath155 @xmath2 ) redshifted by @xmath156 @xmath2 .",
    "ccccccc fwhm ( @xmath2 ) & 1543(55 ) & 1428(18 ) & 5730(58 ) & & 505(6 ) & 568(18 ) + velocity shift ( @xmath2 ) & 1533(24 ) & 1756(7 ) & 373(25 ) & 49(10 ) & & @xmath8022(8 )    oq 208-like sources can offer an unique view to understand the origin of fe ii  emission and the structure of the blr .",
    "a detailed study of this class of objects is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ". we will analyze a sample of such sources discovered in our work in a forthcoming publication .",
    "for the purposes of the present discussion , we simply note : fe ii  emission is not associated with the conventional broad component of h@xmath3  but instead originates from the same region emitting the intermediate component of h@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with our findings in  [ resultshift ] that the width of fe ii  is systematically narrower than that of @xmath4 .",
    "this paper has demonstrated that fe ii  emission most likely does not originate from the same location that produces the broad component of h@xmath3 .",
    "the evidence comes from the systematic redshifts and narrower line widths of fe ii  compared to @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed below , the simplest interpretation is that fe ii  emission originates from an inflow that is located at the outer parts of the blr .",
    "the @xmath4  emission line itself shows no systematic velocity shift , and any velocity shift itself is also small .",
    "this suggests that @xmath4   emission region is well virialized and that the width of @xmath4  is dominated by gravity , making this line suitable for estimating bh masses .",
    "our finding that @xmath61  @xmath157 @xmath5  suggests that the fe iiemission region is farther from the central bh than the @xmath4  emission region .",
    "if the fe ii  emission region is also virialized , so that @xmath158 , then it is about 2 times farther from the center than the @xmath4  region . on the other hand , the systematic redshift of fe ii  indicates that the assumption of virialization may be incorrect .    the redward shift of fe ii  and the inverse correlation between @xmath83  and @xmath77favor a scenario in which fe ii  emission emerges from an inflow . to explain the systematic redshift , the inflow on the back side of the accretion disk must be obscured by the accretion disk and the torus , so that we can only observe the redshifted part on the nearer side .",
    "to explain the inverse correlation between @xmath83  and @xmath77 , we speculate that the inflow is driven by gravity toward the center and decelerated by the radiation pressure .",
    "an increase in @xmath77  would enhance the radiation pressure and lead to a decrease of the inward velocity of the inflow .",
    "previous studies of the c iv  line have shown that it tends to be systematically blueshifted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this finding has led to suggestions that high - ionization lines and low - ionization lines originate from distinct regions ( see also the result of reverberation mapping * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "high - ionization lines such as c iv  may be emitted from some kind of outflowing disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , whereas low - ionization lines such as h@xmath3  are anchored to a more disk - like configuration .",
    "this paper adds an additional element to this picture .",
    "we suggest that in addition to a disk and a wind , the blr has yet another component , one associated with inflowing material that produces the fe ii  emission .",
    "interestingly , @xcite recently reanalyzed the spectral variability of the well - studied seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 and suggested , based on the differential lag between the red and blue wings of the h@xmath3  profile , that the blr in this object contains an inflowing component .",
    "such an inflow is likely to develop from the inner edge of the dusty torus , which may connect with the accretion disk .",
    "if this picture is correct , the redshifted fe ii  emission can be used as a probe of the transition region from the dusty torus to the blr or accretion disk .",
    "more detailed theoretical modelling and observations of the fe ii  emission region are clearly required to test this picture .",
    "using a large sample of quasars selected from sdss , we have studied the properties of their optical fe ii  emission , especially their velocity profile and velocity shift , with the goal of understanding the origin of the nature of the fe ii - emitting region .",
    "this was accomplished using an improved iron template - fitting method , whose reliability has been tested using extensive simulations .",
    "the majority of quasars show redshifted fe ii  emission with respect to the systemic velocity of narrow - line region ( as traced by  @xmath145007 ) or of the conventional broad - line region ( as traced by h@xmath3 ) .",
    "the shift is typically @xmath1",
    "@xmath2  and can be as large as @xmath159 @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , neither the broad h@xmath3  nor mg ii  lines show a systematic velocity shift .",
    "composite spectra reveal that objects with large fe ii  velocity shifts have a tendency to exhibit asymmetric h@xmath3  profiles with an excess red wing .",
    "this phenomenon is particularly notable in a subclass of objects that resembles the prototype oq 208 .",
    "the h@xmath3  profile of oq 208-like sources show a redshifted component of intermediate width that closely resembles the fe ii  emission .",
    "our results strongly indicate that fe ii  emission does not originate from the same region of the blr that produces the `` traditional '' broad component of h@xmath3 . instead , we suggest that fe ii  is associated with the intermediate - width h@xmath3  component , both tracing an inflowing component of the blr .",
