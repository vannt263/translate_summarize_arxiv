    "a real physical system , whether classical or quantum , can not be isolated from its surroundings .",
    "there are a wide range of physical problems described by a quantum field theory which has to be considered in the presence of a matter field .",
    "these matter fields are usually described by some bosonic or fermionic fields .",
    "for example , in quantum optics there are situations where the electromagnetic field should be quantized in the presence of a linear magnetodielectric medium @xcite or in calculating the static and dynamical casimir forces @xcite . in these cases , the matter field should be included directly into the process of quantization in order to have a consistent formulation of the theory .",
    "there are two important situations corresponding to fixed and time - varying boundary conditions .",
    "for example electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of some static dielectrics is a problem with fixed boundary conditions leading to casimir energy between fixed objects . as an example of a time - varying boundary condition we can consider the electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of a moving dielectric @xcite or a scalar field constrained by dirichlet boundary conditions on a moving boundary @xcite or electromagnetic field in the presence of rotating objects @xcite .",
    "an important class of field theories with a time - varying boundary conditions are dynamical casimir effects @xcite . accelerated neutral objects are known to produce so called casimir radiation by dynamical changes in the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic field associated to photon states @xcite .",
    "the classical counterpart of this phenomenon is known as superradiance considered by zeldovich @xcite where he argues that a rotating object amplifies certain incident waves and when quantum mechanical considerations are applied , the object should spontaneously emit photons for some modes .",
    "indeed this is shown to be the case for a rotating black hole by unruh @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of a dielectric body rotating along its axis of symmetry by generalizing the the ideas introduced in @xcite in order to study quantum friction and amplifying ideas from a microscopic point of view beginning from a lagrangian . for this purpose , we begin from a lagrangian describing the whole system by modelling the medium with a continuum of harmonic oscillators @xcite and follow a systematic approach based on canonical quantization of the whole system .",
    "in fact this is a generalization of the scheme introduced in @xcite for electromagnetic field quantization in the presence of a magnetodielectric medium ( see appendix for a brief review ) .",
    "general formulas for rotational friction and power radiated by a rotating body are obtained and in the case of small angular velocity or small radius of a dielectric sphere it is shown that the results coincide with those reported in @xcite . as an example , the rotational friction and power radiated by a small spherical dielectric are obtained in the vicinity of a semi - infinite dielectric plane and limiting cases are discussed . here for convenience we consider the matter field to be non - relativistic although generalization to a full covariant theory @xcite and including magnetic properties is straightforward along the ideas introduced in @xcite and may be dealt with in a separate work .",
    "the coordinate - derivative transformations in rotating and fixed cylindrical reference systems are related by @xmath0 here prime over coordinates denotes the rotating or body frame . a moving dipole produces magnetic moment which can interact with the magnetic component of the the electromagnetic field .",
    "taking this point into account and using the transformations ( [ t ] ) we can propose a lagrangian in the fixed frame based on the lagrangian structure in the body frame of the dielectric . here",
    "we consider the non relativistic regime and for further convenience we assume that the dielectric is homogeneous in its rest frame .",
    "a full covariant theory including magnetic properties is also possible and may be dealt with in a separate work .",
    "now let us consider the following lagrangian for electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric rotating along its axis of symmetry namely @xmath1-axis with angular velocity @xmath2 @xmath3\\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\epsilon_0{{\\int_0^{\\infty}\\,}}d\\nu\\,f_{ij}(\\nu , t)x^j{{\\partial_t}}a_i+\\epsilon_0{{\\int_0^{\\infty}\\,}}d\\nu\\,f_{ij}(\\nu , t)x^j ( \\mathbf{v}\\times{{\\nabla\\times}}\\mathbf{a})_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term is the lagrangian of the electromagnetic field in temporal gauge @xmath4 .",
    "note that in the lab or fixed frame the electromagnetic field is a non rotating field and therefore , no modification is needed , the second term is the lagrangian of the rotating dielectric which is modified trough the transformations ( [ t ] ) , the third and forth terms are the interaction between the dielectric and electromagnetic field inspired from electric @xmath5 and magnetic @xmath6 dipole interactions respectively .",
    "the local velocity @xmath7 is the velocity of a point with position @xmath8 in the dielectric at time @xmath9 which is assumed to be non relativistic i.e @xmath10 .",
    "note that in the third and forth terms the components of the dielectric field @xmath11 should be written in the fixed frame which is equivalent to considering a time - dependent coupling tensor @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 in the body frame @xmath14 and the coupling tensor is diagonal and also in this frame we assume @xmath15 .",
