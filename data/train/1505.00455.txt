    "<S> the knight shift that measures the uniform susceptibility becomes @xmath3 independent below 30  k ( appendix e , fig .  [ figsnmr ] ) , indicating that the low - temperature upturn in @xmath64 comes from large - momentum spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> note that since the nmr form factor for as is known to be broadly distributed in momentum space in ibscs  @xcite , both commensurate ( close to fs nesting ) and incommensurate ( away from nesting ) lesfs are captured by the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath36 .    </S>",
