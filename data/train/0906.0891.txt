    "semiclassics was applied to analyzing the transport properties of chaotic quantum dots in refs .  @xcite . despite clear indications from the quasiclassical method @xcite",
    ", it took many years to understand how to go beyond the diagonal approximation @xcite , and thereby use semiclassics to analyze mesoscopic effects such as weak localization @xcite , universal conductance fluctuations @xcite and shot - noise @xcite . before these works , general statements on the quantum behaviour of such systems relied on the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture @xcite that they are well - described by random - matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "rmt is a statistical theory based on the assumption that we know nothing about the dynamics of the system ( besides global symmetries such as time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetry ) .",
    "however , often this is not the case ; perhaps the system has extra constants of motion or the classical phase space of the system is mixed ( so that some parts are regular and others are chaotic ) .",
    "such systems are hard to treat using rmt methods . in those cases where progress with rmt is possible",
    ", one adds more phenomenological parameters to the theory , thereby reducing its predictive power .",
    "one of the great hopes for semiclassics is that it will provide _ microscopic _ theories for such situations , in which all parameters can be derived from properties of the confining potential ( and any inter - particle interactions that are present ) .",
    "a simpler , but related , problem is that of chaotic systems with additional spatial symmetries ( reflection or inversion symmetries ) .",
    "one can ask two questions .",
    "do spatial symmetries lead to interference effects similar to those induced by time - reversal symmetry ( coherent backscattering and weak localization effects ) ?",
    "if so , how are these interference effects changed by the presence of spatial asymmetries or magnetic fields ?",
    "these discrete spatial symmetries are simple enough to be amenable to a phenomenological analysis with rmt .",
    "such an analysis was carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that spatial symmetries do indeed lead to extra interference effects analogous to weak localization .",
    "since that work , there have been a number of other studies of chaotic systems with symmetries .",
    "refs.@xcite use rmt methods to study the distribution of transmission eigenvalues , while ref .",
    "@xcite identifies a huge interference effect in double - dots separated by a tunnel barrier .",
    "however , none of these works have addressed how the weak localization correction and conductance fluctuations behave for dots that are only approximately symmetric .",
    "this is the first of a pair of articles in which we perform a semiclassical analysis of symmetry - induced interference effects on quantum transport , and in particular their contributions to weak localization corrections and conductance fluctuations .",
    "we consider a quantum dot ( billiard ) whose shape has spatial symmetries ( mirror or inversion symmetries ) but is otherwise shaped such that the classical dynamics within it would exhibit hyperbolic chaos ( exponential divergence of initially close trajectories ) .",
    "we develop a semiclassical theory of transport between two ideal leads coupled to the dot , building on the theory for similar chaotic systems without spatial symmetries .",
    "first , we give a non - phenomenological explanation of the origin of the symmetry - induced interference effects found in rmt @xcite .",
    "we then investigate how transport is affected by asymmetries in the dot , magnetic fields , dephasing , and the ehrenfest time ( which characterizes the emergence of fully developed wave chaos @xcite ) .",
    "for this we make use of analogies with the analysis of dephasing in asymmetric dots @xcite .",
    "we find that different types of deformations away from symmetry destroy the symmetry - induced interference effects in remarkably different ways .",
    "the deformations we consider have the same universal dependence on an asymmetry parameter @xmath1 ; however , the microscopic form of this parameter varies depending on the type of deformation . for a global deformation of the dot ( say half",
    "the dot is displaced outward ) , we find that a displacement @xmath2 of less than a fermi wavelength is sufficient to completely destroy the symmetry - induced interference effects .",
    "in contrast , for the deformation of a small part of the boundary ( say a portion less than but of order a lead - width is displaced outwards ) we find that an arbitrary large displacement @xmath2 does not destroy the symmetry - induced interference effects completely , instead it simply suppresses them by a finite amount .    finally , we address how asymmetries and magnetic fields can be incorporated into a simple phenomenological rmt model , and compare results of numerical computations in this model with the semiclassical predictions .    in the second of this pair of articles @xcite",

    "@xcite , where they were derived in rmt .",

    "thus the leads carry @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes , where @xmath11 for @xmath12 .    assuming that ergodicity of the classical dynamics is established quickly , there are only a few time scales which fully characterize the quantum transport through the dot .",

    "we concentrate on the case @xmath268 .",
    "our results are based on an efficient interpolation scheme between ` pure ' random - matrix ensembles which represent the limiting scenarios of vanishing or strong magnetic field at fully preserved or broken spatial symmetry .",
    "we interpolate between these ensembles by means of a procedure which combines the ideas of two constructions used in earlier related works : the stub model of refs .",
    "@xcite , and the dynamical scattering model of refs.@xcite .",
    "the main common feature of our interpolation procedure and the stub model is the idea to introduce a controllable coupling to a symmetry - breaking or magnetic auxiliary system .",
    "ordinarily , this coupling is introduced on the basis of an internal scattering matrix which partially couples to the leads and partially couples to the auxiliary system .",
    "it is beneficial to adapt this approach in a manner which more clearly separates the modifications in the internal dynamics from the coupling to the leads .",
    "this can be achieved by first focussing on an @xmath269-dimensional unitary evolution operator @xmath270 which represents the internal dynamics of the system .",
    "the operator @xmath270 is taken from a crossover ensemble which we construct by coupling the symmetric system to a symmetry - breaking system , where the flux between the systems is controlled by a parameter ( denoted by @xmath271 ) .",
    "the result of this construction is the following simple interpolation formula of the internal operator ( given in two equivalent forms ) : @xmath272 this is a unitary matrix which smoothly interpolates between @xmath273 and @xmath274 .    for reference ,",
    "table [ table2 ] lists the pure random - matrix ensembles for the internal operator @xmath270 in a form in which the leads specified below respect the spatial symmetries ( see the second part , ref .",
    "@xcite , for a generalized model which allows to displace the leads from their symmetric positions ) .",
    "as explained in appendix [ app : a ] , the form of these matrix ensembles is closely related to the presence or absence of generalized time - reversal symmetry .",
    "drawing pairs @xmath275 , @xmath276 of matrices at random from two different ensembles listed in table [ table2 ] delivers a smooth interpolation of the internal dynamics between specified symmetry scenarios .",
    "the phase - coherent transport through the open system can be obtained from the @xmath277-dimensional scattering matrix @xmath278 , with blocks containing reflection amplitudes @xmath279 , @xmath280 , and transmission amplitudes @xmath55 , @xmath281 .",
    "the dimensionless conductance follows from the landauer formula @xmath282 @xcite .",
    "building up on the internal dynamics , we specify the scattering matrix as @xcite @xmath283 where @xmath284 is a matrix of dimensions @xmath285 which projects onto the leads , while @xmath286 projects onto the hard walls where no leakage occurs .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dyns ] ) lifts the interpolation ( [ eq : interf ] ) of the internal dynamics to an interpolation between different scattering matrix ensembles .    while the resulting expressions for the interpolated scattering matrix are quite similar to the stub model , our construction possesses some practical advantages . in particular , the stub model has the deficit that symmetry is not broken for trajectories which avoid the stub ( corresponding to a direct transfer from entrance to exit ) .",
    "total crossover in the stub model therefore can only be achieved in the limit @xmath287 . that this constraint does not present itself in our procedure is convenient not only because @xmath260 and @xmath288 carry precise microscopic meaning , but also because the ratio @xmath289 represents the dimensionless dwell time featuring in the semiclassical crossover formulae . at the same time",
    ", our interpolation procedure avoids the computational overhead which one would encounter by basing the crossover on other microscopic schemes , such as the pandey - mehta class of hamiltonians @xcite .    in order to determine the physical meaning of the phenomenological parameter @xmath271 we consider the universal limit @xmath290 , in which a particle typically undergoes many internal reflections before leaving the system .",
    "each internal reflection probes the broken symmetry , so that we expect that the crossover is essentially completed for small values of @xmath271 , on a crossover scale @xmath291 which scales with the inverse square - root of the dimensionless dwell time . comparing this crossover acceleration with the effect of a magnetic field in microscopic models ( ref .",

    "[ fig : numerics3 ] shows the same transitions for a finite magnetic field . for all symmetry - breaking scenarios the numerical results of the phenomenological random - matrix model are in excellent agreement with the semiclassical predictions .",
    "we have investigated the effect of spatial symmetries on transport through chaotic quantum dots , putting significant effort into studying how asymmetries cause a crossover in the weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations ( from perfect spatial symmetry to completely broken symmetry ) . understanding this crossover is crucial for observing symmetry - induced effects in experiments .",
    "experimenters who believe that their systems are spatially symmetric can demonstrate it by confirming that the interference effects have the deformation dependence that we predict .",
    "we are unaware of any experiments in which such symmetry effects have thus far been observed , so here we estimates the conditions under which such observations would be feasible .",
    "the theory presented in this article is for electron transport through quantum dots .",
    "ultra - clean quantum dots are made by placing top gates on two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) , where typically the electron s wavelength @xmath302 nm @xcite . to observe effects induced by a spatial symmetry",
    ", the dot s symmetry must be respected on a scale much less than 50 nm .",
    "for example , if a typical electron bounces fifty times before escaping , @xmath303 , then eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - asym - gentle - ripple],[eq : z_lr1 ] ) indicate that symmetry induced effects will only be significant if imperfections in the dot s boundary are on a scale @xmath304 nm .",
    "this is a substantial experimental challenge , but it is not beyond the realms of possibility .",
    "note that we have neglected disorder throughout ( although it can be included without difficulty as another asymmetry ) . for quantum dots",
    "this is justifiable , due to the remarkable progress in making clean 2degs which now have mean - free paths between subsequent impurity scatterings of order of half a millimetre  @xcite .",
    "consider a dot with 10 modes on each lead , meaning a lead width of @xmath305 nm , with @xmath303 .",
    "such a dot has @xmath306 m , so the typical distance travelled by an electron between entering and leaving the dot is @xmath307 m .",
    "the probability to escape without hitting an impurity is thus about @xmath308 , so we can expect that disorder only reduces the effects discussed here by about @xmath309 .",
    "if , in contrast , one takes a dot with 5 modes on each lead and @xmath310 ( then @xmath311 m ) , one finds a probability to escape without hitting an impurity as high as @xmath312 .",
    "while our theory is for electrons in quantum dots , the results are applicable to any waves in chaotic shaped systems ; microwaves in a cavity , ripples on water in a container , vibrations of metal plates , etc .",
    "turning to microwaves in chaotic - shaped cavities @xcite , we note that the dimensionless conductances that we calculate in this work can be interpreted as a measure of the microwave power transmitted from one lead to the other .",
    "experimentally , the microwave wavelengths are typically a few centimetres , so one only needs to make a cavity within a few millimetres of perfectly symmetric to see a significant effect .",
    "this is easily attainable with conventional precision engineering .",
    "however we note that our results are for leads carrying many modes , when most experiments to - date on microwave cavities use single - mode leads . in the single - mode case ,",
    "the interference effects are significantly more complicated than those described here .",
    "by working with a microscopic theory ( rather than the essentially phenomenological rmt ) we are not only able to extract the form of the symmetric / asymmetric crossover , we are also able to say how the crossover parameter @xmath0 depends on the nature of the deformation of the dot .",
    "such knowledge is crucial in determining if an experimental system is close to being spatially symmetric .",
    "we find a remarkable wide variation in this dependence , which for global deformations takes the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - asym - gentle - ripple ] ) while for local deformations it is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - asym - local - deform ] ) .",
    "we hope that the semiclassical method developed here will lead to an improved understanding of situations where rmt is hard to apply , such as systems with a mixed phase space for which at present only phenomenological descriptions are available .    in the second of this pair of articles @xcite , we turn to the problem of a spatially symmetric dot coupled to leads which do not respect the symmetry .",
    "rw thanks p.  brouwer , p.  marconcini and m.  macucci for interesting and useful discussions .",
    "rw and hs are grateful for the hospitality of the banff international research station , where this work was initiated .",
    "the concept of a generalized time - reversal symmetry is frequently used in the rmt analysis of spatially symmetric systems @xcite . we do not explicitly use this concept in our semiclassical calculations but here discuss it briefly because it informs the construction of the rmt ensembles listed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "a spatially symmetric system which is not symmetric under the standard ( momentum - reversing ) time - reversal symmetry ( such as one with a magnetic field @xmath80 ) may still be invariant under the combination of time - reversal and a spatial symmetry . to see this one should note two things ; firstly , _ all _ quantum systems are symmetric under time - reversal if one also changes the sign of the external magnetic field ; secondly , mirror symmetries ( up - down or left - right symmetry ) map a system onto itself with the opposite sign for the external ( perpendicular ) magnetic field .",
    "thus one immediately sees that an up - down symmetric system will be invariant under the combination of time - reversal and mirror symmetry ; this is an example of a generalized time - reversal symmetry . combining this with the fact that odd ( even ) transverse lead modes couple only to odd ( even ) internal states in the dot @xcite",
    ", we obtain the rmt ensembles for up - down symmetry in table [ table2 ]  odd ( even ) dot states being those that do ( do not ) change sign under the up - down mapping .",
    "in particular , the generalized time - reversal symmetry manifests itself in the fact that the ensemble is given by combinations of coe matrices for all magnetic fields , even for @xmath253 where one might naively expect cue matrices .",
    "the case of a left - right symmetry is a little more involved because acting with the left - right mirror symmetry not only changes the sign of the ( perpendicular ) magnetic field but also interchanges the leads .",
    "thus the generalized time - reversal symmetry here is a combination of time - reversal symmetry , the left - right symmetry , and the re - labelling of the leads ( l@xmath313 r ) to obtain the ensembles in table  [ table2 ] , one combines this with the fact that all l lead modes couple equally to even and odd dot states , while all r modes have positive coupling to even dot states and negative coupling to odd states .",
    "however , once again the presence of the generalized time - reversal symmetry manifests itself in the fact that the ensemble is given by coe matrices even when @xmath251 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .    in the case of an inversion symmetry",
    ", there is no generalized time - reversal symmetry , and thus the ensemble switches from coe matrices for @xmath314 to cue matrices for @xmath80 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the reason for the absence of a generalized time - reversal symmetry is that the inversion symmetry mapping does _ not _ change the sign of the magnetic field .",
    "thus for @xmath80 , one can not construct an invariance out of the time - reversal and inversion symmetries .",
    "having outlined the concept of generalized time - reversal symmetries , one sees that they are most natural in the abstract space used for rmt .",
    "however , once we turn to the semiclassical description of concrete systems in which we write contributions in terms of time evolution in phase space , time - reversal symmetry and spatial symmetries are most naturally treated independently from each other .",
