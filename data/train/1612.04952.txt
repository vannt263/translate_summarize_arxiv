    "in this note we focus on two notions that have played a relevant role in the theory of multivariate polynomial approximation during the last 20 years : the notion of _ polynomial mesh _ and the notion of _ dubiner distance _ in a compact set or manifold @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we connect the theory of polynomial meshes with the recent method of _ caratheodory - tchakaloff ( catch ) subsampling _ , working in particular on the sphere @xmath1 .    in what follows",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the subspace of @xmath3-variate polynomials of total degree not exceeding @xmath4 restricted to @xmath5 , and by @xmath6 its dimension .",
    "for example we have that @xmath7 for the ball in @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the sphere @xmath1 .",
    "we briefly recall that a polynomial mesh on @xmath5 is a sequence of finite norming subsets @xmath10 such that the following polynomial inequality holds @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 . indeed ,",
    "since @xmath14 is automatically @xmath15-determining ( i.e. , polynomials vanishing there vanish everywhere on @xmath5 ) , then @xmath16 .",
    "such a mesh is termed _ optimal _ when @xmath17 .    in the case where @xmath18 is substituted by a sequence @xmath19 that increases subexponentially ,",
    "@xmath20 in particular when @xmath21 , @xmath22 , we speak of a _ weakly admissible polynomial mesh_. all these notions can be given for @xmath23 but we restrict here to the real case .",
    "the notion of polynomial mesh was introduced in the seminal paper @xcite and then used from both the theoretical and the computational point of view , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "* are affinely invariant and are stable under small perturbations @xcite * can be extended by algebraic transforms , finite union and product @xcite * contain computable near optimal interpolation sets @xcite * are near optimal for uniform least squares ( ls ) approximation ( cf .",
    "1 ) ) , namely @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath26-orthogonal projection operator @xmath27 ( the discrete ls operator at @xmath14 ) , from which easily follows @xmath28      introduced by m. dubiner in the seminal paper @xcite , it belongs to a family of three distances ( the other two are the markov distance and the baran distance ) that play an important role in multivariate polynomial approximation and have deep connections with multivariate polynomial inequalities .",
    "we refer the readers , e.g. , to @xcite and to the references therein for relevant properties and results .    as far as we know , until now the dubiner distance is known analytically only in very few instances : the interval ( where it coincides with the usual distance @xmath32 ) , the cube , the simplex , the ball , and the sphere .",
    "all these cases are treated in @xcite . in particular , it can be proved via the classical van der corput - schaake inequality that on the sphere it coincides with the usual _ geodesic distance _ , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the euclidean scalar product in @xmath8 .",
    "particular , that @xmath14 need not be discrete . in the case where ( [ covering ] ) is satisfied by a sequence of finite subsets with @xmath42 , @xmath13 ,",
    "then these subsets clearly form a polynomial mesh like ( [ wam ] ) for @xmath5 , with @xmath43 .",
    "let us now focus on the case of the sphere , @xmath44 .",
    "we recall that a sequence of finite point configurations @xmath45 , with cardinality @xmath46 , is termed a `` good covering '' of the sphere if its _ covering radius _ @xmath47 satisfies the inequality @xmath48 for some @xmath49 ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , the survey paper @xcite ) .",
    "it is then easy to prove the following result ( that can be obtained also via a tangential markov inequality on the sphere with exponent 1 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) :      0.3 cm",
    "_ proof_. by ( [ covradius])-([estradius ] ) and simple geometric considerations , for every @xmath54 there exists @xmath55 such that we have the estimate @xmath56 ( provided that @xmath57 that is @xmath58 ) , where @xmath59 is the geodesic distance , i.e. , the dubiner distance . by proposition 1 , in order to determine @xmath60 it is the sufficient to fulfill the inequality @xmath61 or equivalently @xmath62 by the trigonometric inequality @xmath63 , valid for @xmath64 , we get @xmath65 and thus ( [ intermediate ] ) is satisfied if @xmath66 i.e. for @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 0.3 cm    among good covering configurations of @xmath1 , an important role is played by the so - called `` quasi - uniform '' ones , that are those configurations with bounded ratio between the covering radius and the point separation ( mesh ratio ) .",
    "indeed , quasi - uniform configurations provide discretizations of the sphere that keep a low information redundancy . in @xcite",
    "several quasi - uniform configurations are listed and their properties discussed .",
    "an interesting instance is the _ zonal equal area configurations _ ( generated by zonal equal area partitions of the sphere ) , that turn out to be both , quasi - uniform and equidistributed in the sense of the surface area measure .",
    "in particular , they are theoretically good covering with @xmath69 ( but the numerical experiments suggest @xmath70 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and can be efficiently computed by the matlab toolbox @xcite . for example",
    ", taking @xmath71 by proposition 2 we have the following quantitative result :      0.3 cm the situation above is typical : polynomial meshes , even optimal ones , have often a large cardinality ( though optimal as order of growth in @xmath4 ) , which means large samples in the applications , for example in polynomial least squares . to this respect",
    ", it is useful to seek weakly admissible meshes with lower cardinality .",
    "this is exactly what we are going to do in the next section , by the method of caratheodory - tchakaloff subsampling .    to conclude this section",
    ", we observe that proposition 1 can be used to generate optimal polynomial meshes in other cases where the dubiner distance is explicitly known .",
    "for example , in the square @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] @xmath75 ^ 2 $ ] by the so - called _",
    "padua points_. we recall that the padua points of degree @xmath76 for the square @xmath77 ^ 2 $ ] are given by the union of two chebyshev - lobatto subgrids @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and the supscripts mean that only even or odd indexes are considered .",
    "they are a near - optimal point set for polynomial interpolation of total degree @xmath76 , with a lebesgue constant increasing as log square of the degree ; cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite . extending a similar result for univariate chebyshev - like points",
    ", we can prove the following        we stress that the cardinality is asymptotically @xmath87 , that is essentially half the cardinality obtainable by embedding the problem in the tensorial polynomial space @xmath88 , and using for example product chebyshev points of degree @xmath89 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .      in order to reduce the cardinality of a polynomial mesh , a feature that is relevant in applications , we may try to relax the boundedness requirement for the ratio @xmath90 , seeking a _ weakly admissible mesh _ contained in the original one , where the ratio is allowed to increase algebraically with respect to the polynomial space dimension @xmath91 .    in principle",
    ", this can be done by computing fekete points @xmath92 .",
    "these are a subset of @xmath14 that maximizes the vandermonde determinant ( not unique in general ) , so that the corresponding cardinal polynomials are bounded by 1 in @xmath93 , and by @xmath18 in @xmath94 .",
    "this entails that such discrete fekete points are unisolvent and form a weakly admissible mesh of cardinality @xmath91 , @xmath95 being a bound on their lebesgue constant @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , even the discrete fekete points ( as the continuous one ) are difficult and costly to compute . in several papers ,",
    "approximate fekete points extracted from polynomial meshes have been computed by greedy algorithms based on standard numerical linear algebra routines ; cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these points work effectively for interpolation , and are asymptotically distributed as the continuous fekete points , but no rigorous bound has been proved for their lebesgue constant .    in the case of the sphere , the continuous fekete ( maximum determinant ) points have been computed by a difficult numerical nonconvex optimization up to degrees in the hundreds , estimating also numerically the corresponding lebesgue constants ; cf . @xcite .",
    "as it is well - known , the difficulties of polynomial interpolation on the sphere have led to the alternative approach of _ hyperinterpolation _ , cf .",
    "the seminal paper @xcite and the numerous developments in the following 20 years .",
    "in the present note , starting from optimal polynomial meshes of the sphere , we explore an alternative discrete approach , that can be considered a sort of fully discrete hyperinterpolation , namely the extraction of _ caratheodory - tchakaloff submeshes_. these are computable by linear or quadratic programming , and there are rigorous bounds for the corresponding constants @xmath19 .",
    "first , we recall a discrete version of the tchakaloff theorem , a cornerstone of quadrature theory , whose proof is based on the caratheodory theorem about finite dimensional conic combinations ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we focus here on total - degree polynomial spaces and we recall the proof to exhibit the connection with the caratheodory theorem .",
    "0.3 cm _ proof _ ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath104 be a basis of @xmath105 , and @xmath106 the vandermonde - like matrix of the basis computed at the support points .",
    "if @xmath107 ( otherwise there is nothing to prove ) , existence of a positive quadrature formula for @xmath96 with cardinality not exceeding @xmath108 can be immediately translated into existence of a nonnegative solution with at most @xmath108 nonvanishing components to the underdetermined linear system @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the vector of @xmath96-moments of the basis @xmath111 .",
    "existence then holds by the well - known caratheodory theorem applied to the columns of @xmath112 , which asserts that a conic ( i.e. , with positive coefficients ) combination of any number of vectors in @xmath113 can be rewritten as a conic combination of a linearly independent subset of at most @xmath108 of them.@xmath68 0.3 cm      let @xmath10 be a polynomial mesh like ( [ wam ] ) for @xmath5 with cardinality @xmath115 , let @xmath96 be the discrete measure with unit weights supported at @xmath14 , and let @xmath116 be the @xmath117 caratheodory - tchakaloff quadrature points for exactness degree @xmath118 extracted from @xmath14 , with corresponding weights @xmath101 , @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath120 be the weighted discrete least squares polynomial on @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath121 is a weakly - admissible polynomial mesh like ( [ wam2 ] ) for @xmath5 with @xmath123 ( that we may term a caratheodory - tchakaloff submesh ) , and the following estimate holds for the corresponding weighted least squares approximation @xmath124    0.3 cm _ proof _ ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the caratheodory - tchakaloff quadrature is exact in @xmath125 , we get the basic @xmath126-identity @xmath127 then we can write @xmath128 @xmath129 i.e. , @xmath121 is a weakly - admissible polynomial mesh for @xmath5 with @xmath130 .",
    "concerning the weighted least squares polynomial approximation on @xmath121 , we recall that it is defined by @xmath131 and that @xmath132 is a @xmath133-orthogonal projection , i.e. , @xmath134 is @xmath133-orthogonal to @xmath135 .",
    "then , @xmath136 @xmath137 that is @xmath138 from which ( [ wlserr ] ) easily follows.@xmath68 0.3 cm    observe that the error estimate ( [ wlserr ] ) for weighted discrete least squares on the caratheodory - tchakaloff submesh , turns out to coincide with the natural error estimate ( [ lserr ] ) for unweighted least squares on the original polynomial mesh . in some sense , caratheodory - tchakaloff weighted least squares on the submesh catches",
    "all the relevant information from the polynomial mesh , as far as polynomial approximation in @xmath135 is concerned .",
    "we recall that the best uniform approximation error in @xmath135 can be estimated by the regularity of @xmath139 , on compact sets @xmath5 admitting a jackson - like theorem ; cf . , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath121 is a weakly admissible mesh for the sphere with cardinality @xmath140 , and ( [ wlserr ] ) holds for the corresponding weighted least squares polynomial approximation @xmath132 to @xmath141 , where @xmath142 in particular , for a caratheodory - tchakaloff submesh of the zonal equal area configurations of corollary 1 , we have @xmath143    0.3 cm we observe that by ( ( [ lsnorm ] ) , ( [ wlsnorm ] ) and ( [ cnsphere ] ) we get @xmath144 estimates for the least squares operator norms , whereas the best projection operators on @xmath145 have a @xmath146 norm ; cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "( [ wlsnorm ] ) turns out to be an overestimate of the actual norm , as we shall see in the numerical examples .      in order to compute a sparse nonnegative solution to the underdermined system ( [ momeqs])-([moments ] ) , that exists by tchakaloff theorem ( theorem 1 above ) , there are a number of different approaches available .",
    "we focus here on the case of the sphere , where we use the classical spherical harmonics basis to define the vandermonde - like matrix @xmath147 .    a first approach resorts to quadratic programming , namely to the nonnegative least squares problem @xmath148 which can be solved by the lawson - hanson active set method , which naturally seeks a sparse solution ; cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "the nonzero components of @xmath149 identify the weights @xmath101 and the corresponding catch submesh @xmath121 .",
    "a second approach is based on linear programming ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , namely @xmath150 where the constraints identify a polytope ( the feasible region ) , and the vector @xmath151 is suitably chosen ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . solving the problem by the classical simplex method",
    ", we get a vertex of the polytope , that is a nonnegative sparse solution to the underdetermined system .",
    "it is worth observing that sparsity can not be ensured by the standard compressive sensing approach to underdetermined systems , such as the basis pursuit algorithm that minimizes @xmath152 ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) , since @xmath153 is here constant by construction ( being the quadrature formula applied to the constant polynomial @xmath154 ) .",
    "in our matlab codes for caratheodory - tchakaloff least squares we have adopted both the qp approach ( via an optimized version of the lsqnonneg function ) , and the lp approach ( via the simplex method in the matlab interface of the cplex package ) ; cf .",
    "@xcite .    in table 1 , we report the numerical results corresponding to the extraction of catch submeshes from zonal equal area meshes of @xmath1 , for a sequence of degrees .",
    "all the quantities are rounded to the first decimal digit .",
    "we have that the cardinality of the catch submeshes is @xmath155 , and that the compression ratio , @xmath156 , increases , approaching the asymptotic value @xmath157 , cf .",
    "corollary 1 . since @xmath158 , the average catch weight turns out to coincide with the compression ratio .",
    "notice that the minimum of the catch weights computed by qp is much smaller than the minimum of the catch weights computed by lp .",
    "moreover , we see that the compressed least squares operator norms @xmath159 are close to the norm @xmath160 of the least squares operator on the starting mesh , with a slightly better behavior of catch submeshes extracted by qp with respect to those extracted by lp . on the other hand ,",
    "all the norms are much lower than the theoretical overestimate @xmath161 in corollary 2 , having substantially a @xmath146 increase ( at least in the considered degree range ) .    in table 2 , we report the reconstruction errors by least squares ( in the @xmath162-norm , numerically evaluated on a fine control grid ) , for three test functions with different degree of regularity @xmath163 @xmath164 namely a polynomial , a smooth function and a function with singular points on the sphere ( the latter two taken from @xcite ) .",
