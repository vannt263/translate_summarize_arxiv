    "wurtzite we obtain @xmath94  ev and @xmath95  ev ; for bulk zinc blende we obtain @xmath96  ev and @xmath97  ev .",

    "the wurtzite and zinc - blende @xmath67 values are both larger than the corresponding @xmath67 bulk constants .",
    "these differences can also be explained by the different roles played by the mn holes in bulk structures and in quantum dots ( as seen in previous sec .",

    "[ gap- ] and magnetic order of two mn spins in the last section .",
    "in fact , the mn atom close to the crystal surface induces impurity states near the conduction levels .",
    "now , to make contact with the antiferromagnetic coupling of such mn atoms , it is essential to consider other iii - v nanoparticles .    experimentally , ( ga , mn)as nanocrystals can be created by mn implantation on gaas followed by thermal treatment,@xcite and also by annealing ( ga , mn)as thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy.@xcite the self - organized nanoclusters are analyzed by x - ray spectroscopy,@xcite microscopic techniques,@xcite and also by using squid magnetometry.@xcite magnetic force microscopy measurements on ( ga , mn)as nanoprecipitates show ferromagnetic features at room temperature.@xcite this experimental result and the reported antiferromagnetic behavior of ( ga , mn)n quantum dots motivates us to search for a change in the magnetic order also in ( ga , mn)as nanocrystals .    to illustrate this other compound ,",
    "( ga , mn)as , without taking into consideration all the positions for mn , let us focus on i - ii sites , i.e. the case shown to be clearly antiferromagnetic ( afm ) in ( ga , mn)n .",
    "we calculate ( ga , mn)as nanoparticles with two mn dopants which replace two ga atoms in the close interacting sites i - ii .",
    "we study both wurtzite and zinc - blende geometries of about 1  nm in diameter as those given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the computational details in this case are similar to those already explained in sec .  [ computational ] .",
    "as compared with the undoped structures , in the doped ones the as shell around the mn atom close to surface is expanded by @xmath98 , thus it is more expanded than the n shell in ( ga , mn)n nanoparticles . moreover , the computed quantum dots are ferromagnetic ( fm ) in the ground state , with a fm - afm exchange interaction of 122  mev in the wurtzite phase and 104  mev in the zinc - blende phase . these exchange energies are roughly half the bulk value for mn atoms sitting in close ga positions , @xmath99200  mev,@xcite in agreement with the same decreasing tendency already calculated for other magnetic nanostructures such as ( cd , mn)te nanocrystals.@xcite    it should be clear from the previous discussion of mn in gan quantum dots that for ferromagnetic mn spins the so - called mn hole levels must be close to the gaas valence states . indeed , the local densities of states projected onto the mn 3@xmath1 states in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] show that the mn holes in gaas nanoparticles are close together in the nearby of the valence region .",
    "these mn holes behave hence as in bulk ( ga , mn)as@xcite and mediate the ferromagnetic alignment of the two mn spins .",
    "looking at the mn hole levels in its relation to the valence ( conduction ) region , we can see a ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) behavior of mn impurities in doped nanostructures .",
    "the difference in this hole position must be found in the smaller bond compression around mn for ( ga , mn)as quantum dots .",
    "in summary , we have investigated wurtzite and zinc - blende ( ga , mn)n quantum dots doped with one or two substitutional mn impurities within density functional theory . we have obtained that wurtzite and zinc - blende structures show similar results as they can not be distinguished up to second neighbors .",
    "anyhow , there are small differences between them commented in the text when appropiate . for a single mn dopant in the dot center , the calculated @xmath67 values are larger than in bulk ( ga , mn)n with similar mn concentration . for two mn dopants ,",
    "the most stable magnetic state is antiferromagnetic , and this was unexpected since bulk ( ga , mn)n exhibits ferromagnetism in the ground state . we ascribe this surprising effect in ( ga , mn)n nanoparticles to the holes linked to the mn impurities placed close to surface . these holes do not contribute effectively to the ferromagnetic order of the two mn spins .",
    "we show that the ferromagnetic behavior of bulk ( ga , mn)n can be changed by reducing the crystal size .    from the antiferromagnetic result on small ( ga , mn)n nanoparticles , it seems possible that larger dots and other nanostructures such as thin films with mn dopants close to surface could also be antiferromagnetic in the ground state .",
    "therefore , we hope that our results concerning antiferromagnetic ( ga , mn)n quantum dots will encourage further _ ab - initio _ calculations and experiments on mn impurities buried near surfaces of semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "indeed , recent in - progress work on ( ga , mn)n nanolayers suggests the same antiferromagnetic behavior for mn spins ."
