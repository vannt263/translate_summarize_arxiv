    "the dwarf galaxy ic10 is a very interesting stellar system in the local group .",
    "it has been classified as an ir iv by van  den  bergh ( 1999 ) , but it has also been suggested that it is the only analog of a post - starburst dwarf galaxy in the local group ( gil de paz et al .",
    "this means that ic10 is a very good laboratory to investigate episodic star formation over a broad time interval ( hunter 2001 ; demers et al.2004 ) .",
    "moreover , spectroscopic estimates based on hii regions indicate that the present - day interstellar medium metal abundance is @xmath14\\sim-0.71\\pm0.10 $ ] , ( garnett et al .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility of a range of metallicity in ic10 , but comparison with stellar isochrones ( hunter 2001 ) also indicates a mean metallicity of @xmath14\\sim-0.7 $ ] .",
    "this metal content is very similar to that of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; @xmath14\\approx -0.7 $ ] , zaritsky et al .",
    "1994 , based on hii regions ; @xmath14\\sim-0.75\\pm0.08 $ ] , romaniello et al .  2008 , based on classical cepheids ) .",
    "however , ic10 is located at very low galactic latitude ( l=1190 , b=-33 ) , and is therefore affected by significant foreground extinction .",
    "this circumstance has made estimates of both reddening and distance quite difficult and controversial .",
    "distance determinations based on different standard candles cover a wide range , from closer than m31@xmath15 mpc based on the red giant branch tip ( trgb , sakai et al .",
    "1999)to well outside the local group , @xmath16 mpc based on the luminosity function ( lf ) of planetary nebulae ( jacoby & lesser 1981 ) .",
    "a similar disparity is found among the reddening determinations , with estimates ranging from @xmath17 based on spectra of hii regions ( richer et al .",
    "2001 ) , to @xmath18 based on classical cepheids ( sakai et al .",
    "moreover , a spread in distance and reddening values can be found even when using the same distance indicator and stellar tracer ( see table  1 , in demers et al .",
    "therefore , we still lack firm constraints on the random and systematic errors affecting these important parameters .",
    "our photometric catalog is based on archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) data sets collected with both the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , pointings @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 , pointing @xmath21 ) , go9683 , pi : f.e .",

    "pointings @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( acs ) overlap by about one chip , while pointing @xmath21 ( wfpc2 ) almost entirely overlaps with pointing @xmath19 .",
    "we combined the acs images using an updated version of the multidrizzle package ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2002 ) , which provides an automated method for correcting distortion and combining dithered images .",
    "the wfpc2 images were prereduced using the hst pipeline .",
    "initial photometry on individual images was performed with daophot iv , followed by simultaneous photometry over the 80 images with allframe ( stetson , 1994 ) .",
    "we ended up with a catalog including @xmath26 stars with at least one measurement in each of two different bands .",
    "the acs data in the @xmath25 and @xmath23 bands were transformed into the vegamag system following sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . to provide a homogeneous photometric catalog",
    "the @xmath22-band images collected with the acs were transformed into the @xmath25-band using local standards .",
    "the same approach was adopted to transform the @xmath25 and the @xmath23 images collected with wfpc2 to the corresponding acs systems . on average the precision of the above transformations",
    "is @xmath25-@xmath22(acs)= -0.006 @xmath2 0.049 , @xmath25(acs)-@xmath25(wfpc2)= 0.009 @xmath2 0.054 , @xmath23(acs)-@xmath23(wfpc2)= 0.003 @xmath2 0.050 mag ( sanna et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) . to overcome possible changes in the internal reddening when moving from the center toward the external regions of the galaxy we split the final catalog into two different regions .",
    "region c is located at the galaxy center , while the field lying at a radial distance larger than two arcminutes is our region e. data plotted in fig .  1 show that the current photometry ranges from very bright main sequence stars ( @xmath27 , @xmath25-@xmath23@xmath28 ) to faint rg stars ( @xmath29 , @xmath25-@xmath23@xmath30 ) with very good precision .",
    "to estimate the trgb in ic10 we adopted the approach used in bono et al.(2008 , hereinafter b08 ) . in particular , we selected stars with @xmath31 @xmath23 @xmath32 and @xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "note that the stellar samples in the central and external regions include , respectively , @xmath35 and @xmath36 stars within one @xmath23-band magnitude of the tip .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger than the number required for a robust detection of the trgb ( madore & freedman 1995 ) .",
    "the top panels of fig .  2 show a well defined jump in the star counts for @xmath37 , which we take to mark the position of the trgb .",
    "this identification is supported by the smoothed lf obtained with a gaussian kernel having a standard deviation equal to the photometric error ( sakai et al .",
    "1996 ; middle panels ) .",
    "finally , the bottom panels show the response of the edge detector , a four - point sobel filter convolved with the smoothed lf .",
    "the dashed vertical lines mark our detection of the trgb at @xmath0= @xmath38 for the central field ( left ) and @xmath0= @xmath39 for the external field ( right ) .",
    "the error in these trgb estimates is given by the bin size adopted in the lf ( fig .  2 , top panels ) .",
    "we adopted empirical calibrators to determine the reddening and the distance to ic10 .",
    "this approach is minimally affected by uncertainties in the transformation of theoretical predictions into the observational plane .",
    "moreover , it provides robust estimates of _ relative _ distances and reddenings .",
    "the main drawback is that the empirical calibrators require similar mean metallicities ( or at least trustworthy metallicity corrections ) . to estimate the reddening we used the accurate photometry of the region located around the smc cluster ngc  346 recently provided by sabbi et al .",
    "this data set offers several advantages : _",
    "i ) _  the data were collected with acs in the same @xmath25 , @xmath23-bands ; _ ii ) _  the stellar populations in this region span a very broad age range , namely from the few myrs of ngc  346 to the several gyrs ( @xmath40 gyr ) of the intermediate - age cluster bs90 ; _ iii ) _  the region is characterized by modest reddening ( e(b - v)=0.08 ) and is minimally contaminated by galactic field stars ; _ iv _ ) the mean metallicity is very similar to the mean metallicity of ic10 .",
    "the relative reddening was estimated by moving the young smc ms until it matched the bluest ms stars in ic10 to account for possible differential reddening .",
    "fortunately enough , the distribution of these stars in the @xmath23 , @xmath25-@xmath23 cmd is almost vertical and with the rgs they form a `` v '' shape .",
    "therefore , this approach minimally depends on the adopted distance .",
    "we found a relative reddening of @xmath41@xmath42f555w@xmath43f814w@xmath44=@xmath45 for both the central and the external region of ic10 .",
    "this indicates that the reddening in the two fields is , within the errors , the same . using the analytical relation for stellar extinction provided by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) we found that the selective absorptions in the two acs filters are : @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "if we assume an smc reddening of e(b - v)=0.08 ( sabbi et al .",
    "2007 ) , this means a mean reddening of e(@xmath25-@xmath23)=@xmath48 for ic10 , and in turn @xmath49=0.78@xmath20.06 .",
    "the error budget includes generous estimates on the relative reddening ( @xmath50 ) , on the smc reddening ( @xmath51 ) and on the reddening law ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "the left panel of fig .  3 shows the comparison between the smc ( green dots ) and ic10 ( gray dots ) using the above differential reddening and relative distance based on the trgb ( see _ infra _ ) .",
    "the new reddening estimate is in very good agreement with the reddening estimates based on spectra of hii regions ( e(b - v)=0.77 @xmath2 0.07 , richer et al .",
    "2001 ) , trgb stars ( e(b - v ) @xmath52 0.85 , sakai et al .  1999 ) , carbon stars ( e(b - v ) @xmath52 0.79 , and a change across the field of @xmath52 0.38 mag , demers et al .",
    "2004 ) , and wolf - rayet stars ( e(b - v)=0.75 - 0.80 , massey & armandroff 1995 ) . we do not support a reddening as high as was estimated from classical cepheid variables .",
    "we also estimated the relative distance between ic10 and the smc .",
    "for the smc , we adopted the trgb estimate provided by cioni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , i.e. , @xmath53 . with the reddening quoted above for smc ( e(b - v)=0.08 ) , the color - metallicity relation for trgb stars provided by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the transformations from the cousins @xmath54-band to the acs vegamag system by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we found @xmath55 . using the above reddening",
    ", we found that @xmath56 and the error budget includes the same sources of uncertainty as before , plus an additional uncertainty of @xmath57  mag in the photometric calibration .",
    "therefore , the relative distance is @xmath58 .",
    "the arrow plotted in the middle panel of fig .",
    "3 shows that the magnitudes of trgb stars in smc and in ic10 agree within the uncertainties .    to further constrain the relative distance to ic10",
    ", we also compared it to the galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) 47  tuc .",
    "the reason is threefold : _",
    "i ) _  accurate spectroscopic measurements indicate that its iron abundance is very similar to ic10 , i.e. , [ fe / h]=@xmath59 ( gratton et al .",
    "2003 ) ; _ ii ) _ it is minimally affected by reddening : ( e(b - v)=@xmath60 , salaris et al .  2007 ) ; _ iii ) _ an accurate estimate of the trgb has been recently provided by b08 . by transforming the cousins @xmath54-band into the acs vegamag system ( sirianni et al .",
    "2005 ) , we found that the trgb in 47tuc is located at @xmath61 .",
    "the error budget accounts for uncertainties in the reddening , in the trgb detection and in the photometric transformation .",
    "therefore , the relative distance is @xmath62 . a glance at the data plotted in the middle panel of fig .",
    "3 shows very good agreement between the magnitudes of trgb stars in 47tuc and ic10 .",
    "moreover , the rgs in 47tuc also attain very similar colors to rgs in ic10 , thus supporting the reddening ( and metallicity ) estimate .",
    "we also estimated the relative distance between ic10 and the ggc .",
    "again , the reason is threefold : _",
    "i ) _ it is the most massive ggc and it hosts a sizable sample of bright rg stars ( @xmath63 ) close to trgb , so the trgb detection is particularly robust ; _ ii ) _ accurate distance estimates are available using several different standard candles ( del principe et al .",
    "2006 ) ; _ iii ) _ an accurate estimate of the trgb has been recently provided by b08 .",
    "we found that the trgb in is located at @xmath64 .",
    "the error budget accounts for uncertainties in the reddening ( @xmath65 ) , in the trgb detection , and in the photometric transformation .",
    "moreover , we also accounted for the difference in metallicity between ( [ fe / h]@xmath66 , metal - poor peak , johnson et al .",
    "2008 ) and ic10 , and their uncertainties ( b08 ) .",
    "the relative distance is then @xmath67 .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "3 shows that the magnitudes of trgb stars in and in ic10 agree quite well .",
    "the bright rgs in are , as expected , bluer when compared with rgs in ic10 .",
    "to evaluate the true distance to ic10 , we used the trgb calibrations provided by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . for the smc",
    ", we found a true modulus of @xmath6= @xmath68 or @xmath6= @xmath69 ; @xmath6=@xmath70 is the weighted average .",
    "thus , the true modulus of ic10 , based on the trgb scale of smc , is @xmath6= @xmath71 . using the same trgb calibrations we found for 47  tuc a true modulus of @xmath6= @xmath72 and @xmath6= @xmath73 ( @xmath6=@xmath74 , weighted average ) .",
    "thus , the modulus of ic10 , based on the trgb scale of 47  tuc , is @xmath6= @xmath75 .",
    "finally , using the same trgb calibrations the true moduli for are : @xmath6= @xmath76 and @xmath6= @xmath77 ( @xmath6=@xmath78 , weighted average ) .",
    "therefore , the modulus of ic10 , based on the trgb scale of , is @xmath6= @xmath79 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we use the @xmath80-band period - luminosity ( pl ) relations provided by del principe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and sollima et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the true modulus of 47  tuc based on the variable v9 is @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 , weighted average ) .",
    "therefore , the modulus of ic10 , based on the rr lyrae scale , is @xmath84 . using the same @xmath80-band pl relations ,",
    "the true modulus of is @xmath85 or @xmath86 ( @xmath87 , weighted average ) .",
    "therefore , the modulus of ic10 , based on the rr lyrae scale to , is @xmath88 .",
    "the weighted average true moduli of ic10 agree within 1@xmath89 and are : @xmath90 ( trgb scale ) and @xmath91 ( rr lyrae scale ) .",
    "these estimates agree within 1@xmath89 with previous distance determinations based on carbon stars ( @xmath92 , e(b - v)=0.79 , demers et al .",
    "2004 ) ; on optical ( @xmath93 , e(b - v)=0.97 , saha et al .",
    "1996 ) and nir ( @xmath94 , e(b - v)=0.8 , wilson et al .",
    "1996 ) cepheid pl relations ; and on the trgb ( @xmath95 , e(b - v)=0.95 , vacca et al.2007 ) .",
    "however , we found differences of @xmath11 0.40.5 mag with respect to the moduli estimated from wolf - rayet stars ( @xmath96 , e(b - v)=0.750.80 , massey & armandroff 1995 ) and red supergiants ( @xmath97 , e(b - v)=@xmath98 , borissova et al .",
    "this indicates that the quoted distance estimates might be affected by systematic errors .    as a final test of the systematic errors that might affect the distance estimates to ic10 , we calculated new theoretical trgb calibrations .",
    "we adopted the homogeneous set of cluster isochrones for scaled - solar abundances provided by pietrinferni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; in particular , we adopted isochrones with t=12 gyrs , mass - loss @xmath99=0.4 , and iron abundances from @xmath100 [ m / h ] @xmath101 ( see the url http://www.oa-teramo.inaf.it/basti ) .",
    "however , theory was transformed into the observational plane using only scaled - solar atmospheres based on atlas9 models ( castelli et al .",
    "we linearly extrapolated the surface gravity by @xmath520.1 dex and the surface temperature by @xmath52100 k beyond the available range for the most metal - rich structures . to account for the new electron - conduction opacities",
    "the predicted trgb magnitudes were dimmed by 0.075 mag ( cassisi et al .",
    "2007 ) . moreover , to account for uncertainties in the color - temperature transformations ( bellazzini 2008 ) we also adopted scaled - solar atmospheres based on phoenix ( brott et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the new atlas9 and phoenix trgb calibrations agree well ( fig .  4 , bottom panel ) :",
    "over most of the metallicity range differences are much less than 0.1 mag , but they do become perceptibly larger for the most metal - rich structures",
    ". the new trgb calibrations also agree ( fig .  4 , top panel ) , within 1@xmath89 ( see the error bars ) , with empirical trgb calibrations ( lee et al .",
    "1993 ; bellazzini et al .  2004",
    "; rizzi et al .",
    "2007 ) . predicted @xmath102 magnitudes are still systematically brighter than observed ones , but the difference is a factor of two smaller than previous trgb calibrations .",
    "the explanation of this mild discrepancy requires new theoretical and empirical investigations .",
    "we performed spline fits of the theoretical trgb luminosities= -2.267 , -1.790 , -1.488 , -1.266 , -0.963 , -0.659 , -0.481 .",
    "the set of isochrones for [ m / h]= -0.481 was specifically computed for this project .",
    "the anchor points we adopted for the spline fit are : @xmath103= -4.085 , -4.137 , -4.143 , -4.129 , -4.088 , -4.034 , -3.977 ; @xmath104= -4.066 , -4.110 , -4.108 , -4.106 , -4.069 , -4.012 , -3.870 ; @xmath105= -4.089 , -4.140 , -4.143 , -4.130 , -4.085 , -4.018 , -3.947 ; @xmath106= -4.104 , -4.149 , -4.153 , -4.138 , -4.106 , -4.034 , -3.894 . ] in both @xmath54 and @xmath23-band , and from these  by assuming a metal content for ic10 of [ m / h]=-0.70we derived true distance moduli of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the error budget includes uncertainties in the theoretical predictions ( @xmath109  mag ) , the trgb measurement , and in the metal content ( @xmath110  dex ) .",
    "these estimates are in very good agreement with the above distances based on empirical calibrators , thus further supporting the accuracy of the current theoretical calibrations .",
    "the above distances indicate that ic10 is located , within the errors , at the same distance as m31 , which has true moduli based on the trgb ranging from @xmath111 to @xmath112 ( rizzi et al .",
    "2007 ) , while those based on cepheids range from @xmath113 ( sakai et al .  2004 ) to @xmath114 ( vilardell et al . 2007",
