    "one of the important quantities in strongly correlated fermion systems is the single - particle excitation gap because the single - particle excitation gap plays the role of an `` order parameter '' in , e.g. , the half - filled hubbard models , which distinguishes the metallic state from the mott insulating state in the absence of a long - range order .",
    "theoretically , the single - particle excitation gap is usually estimated from the density of states near the fermi energy . to calculate the the single - particle excitations , including the density of states , in strongly correlated systems , the quantum cluster approaches  @xcite are very often employed .",
    "these approaches require a numerical method ( a solver ) to treat many - body problems within small clusters .",
    "the numerically exact diagonalization is one of the methods which allow us to directly calculate the single - particle green s functions at an arbitrary complex frequency  @xcite .",
    "even with the exact diagonalization , when the single - particle excitations are calculated , a finite imaginary @xmath0 of the complex frequency @xmath2 has to be introduced to avoid the poles of the single - particle green s function lying on the real frequency @xmath3 axis . here",
    ", @xmath0 corresponds to the half width at half maximum of the lorentzian broadening for a delta - function peak [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dos ] ) ] .",
    "since the density of states is provided as a sum of delta - function peaks , one has to calculate the density of states using several values of @xmath0 and extrapolate the results to @xmath1 for all frequencies @xmath3 , e.g. , close to the chemical potential .",
    "the numerical extrapolation of @xmath1 is indeed valuable to examine fine structures of the density of states  @xcite .",
    "however , it is often technically cumbersome because appropriate values of @xmath0 have to be chosen to obtain reasonable , i.e. , sharp enough and non - negative , density of states .",
    "the single - particle excitation gap of interacting fermions can be evaluated not only from a direct calculation of the single - particle excitation energies  @xcite but also from a jump of the chemical potential as a function of particle density  @xcite . however , the development of a theoretical method which can resolve fine structures of the many - body density of states is still highly valuable , as it allows us to make a direct comparison with experiments .",
    "for example , the scanning tunneling spectroscopy and microscopy ( sts / stm ) can prove the surface density of states for strongly correlated materials with high resolution  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a method to numerically calculate the density of states of interacting fermions by combining the tetrahedron method  @xcite , widely used for noninteracting systems , with the cluster perturbation theory ( cpt )  @xcite in the lehmann representation  @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to calculate the density of states of interacting fermions without introducing the lorentzian broadening parameter @xmath0 . in deriving the formalism ,",

    "however , the density of states calculated using the tetrahedron method is overwhelmingly sharp and the fine peak structures as well as small gaps can be easily distinguished .",
    "for example , the mott gap is rather clearly observed in the density of states obtained by the tetrahedron method and can be evaluated even when the gap is tiny for small @xmath211 .",
    "two remarks are in order .",
    "first , it is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] that there seem to exist spiky peaks in the density of states for all values of @xmath211 .",
    "these seemingly spiky peaks are not delta - function peaks but have well defined van - hove like structures .",
    "these singularities appear where the stationary condition of the band dispersions is satisfied , i.e. , @xmath212 .",
    "for example , each seemingly spiky peak in fig .",
    "[ fig.dos](e ) well corresponds to the stationary energy of the band dispersions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.bands](b ) . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : lehmann ] and also in appendix  [ appendix ] , the many - body interactions are responsible for the emergence of these multiple energy bands ( in principle , @xmath54 numbers of bands ) .",
    "second , when the momentum @xmath213 at which the gap opens is _ a priori _ known , one can readily calculate the single - particle gap simply by diagonalizing @xmath214 .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for the half - filled hubbard model on the one - dimensional chain ( @xmath215 ) and on the honeycomb lattice ( @xmath213 : @xmath216 and @xmath217 points ) .",
    "it should be noted however that the periodization formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq.cpt ] ) restores only the translational symmetry but not the point - group symmetry of the underlying lattice that is broken by the cluster partitioning .",
    "therefore , the cluster partitioning should be carefully chosen in order not to break the point - group symmetry of the underlaying lattice . otherwise ,",
    "for instance , the dirac points can deviate from the @xmath216 and @xmath217 points in the cpt calculation for the honeycomb lattice , and therefore the simple diagonalization of @xmath218 is not enough to estimate the single - particle gap .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the extension of the tetrahedron method combined with the cpt to symmetry broken states , 3d systems , and finite - temperature calculations .      using the variational cluster approximation ( vca )  @xcite , the present method can be adapted to symmetry broken states straightforwardly .",
    "the vca introduces symmetry breaking weiss fields @xmath219 to the system and determines the optimal value @xmath220 which satisfies the stationary condition @xmath221 for the grand - potential functional @xmath222  @xcite .",
    "once the weiss fields are optimized , we can easily obtain the single - particle green s function @xmath223 with @xmath224  @xcite . using this green s function @xmath223 ,",
    "the physical quantities including the density of states can be calculated for symmetry broken states .",
    "technical details of the vca can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath84 and ref .",
    "@xcite for finite temperatures . since the lehmann representation of the single - particle green s function @xmath223 is exactly the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gab ] ) , we can apply the tetrahedron method introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] to symmetry broken states .",
    "we should note here that in the vca we also encounter the momentum integral for the grand - potential functional over the whole brillouin zone .",
    "indeed , the grand - potential functional @xmath225 per site in the zero - temperature limit is evaluated as @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the exact grand potential per site of the cluster , @xmath228 is the step function , @xmath229 now denotes the momentum in the reduced brillouin zone for the superlattice on which the clusters are defined , and @xmath230 is the volume of the reduced brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "notice that in general @xmath231 and @xmath232 can depend on the spin - orbital index @xmath31 in symmetry broken states and the dependencies on @xmath31 are implicitly incorporated in @xmath116 .",
    "although the fermi energy @xmath233 is set to be zero in the preceding sections , here we show it explicitly for clarity .",
    "it is noticed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grand ] ) that the third term on the right - hand side is the momentum integral for the effective single - particle energy @xmath234 below the fermi energy .",
    "we can therefore apply the tetrahedron method for the calculation of the grand potential functional in the vca . for this purpose ,",
    "the integration weight @xmath172 is required because the momentum integral involves the step function @xmath228 , instead of the delta function .",
    "namely , we can evaluate the momentum integral in the tetrahedron method as @xmath235 where the triangular partitioning should be applied for the reduced brillouin zone and the integration weight @xmath172 is provided in table  [ table ] .      although the formulation provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] is for 2d interacting fermion systems , the application to 3d systems is straightforward . simply referring to the original papers on the tetrahedron method in the single - particle theory  @xcite",
    ", one can easily complete table  [ table ] for 3d interacting fermion systems .",
    "for example , the vca has been employed recently to investigate the competing magnetic orders and single - particle excitations of the single - band hubbard model on the stacked square lattice  @xcite and the simple cubic lattice  @xcite with longer - range hoppings .      the tetrahedron method introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] requires diagonalizing the effective single - particle hamiltonian matrix @xmath64 at each momentum @xmath27 to obtain the single - particle excitation energies and spectral - weight functions for interacting fermions . at zero temperature ,",
    "the dimension of @xmath92 is typically @xmath236 and thus the numerical diagonalization of @xmath92 is computationally not expensive . on the other hand , at finite temperatures , @xmath54 reaches @xmath237 and can become much larger  @xcite .",
    "this is certainly the case even at zero temperature when the size of clusters is large .",
    "however , @xmath92 can be independently diagonalized at different momenta and thus the @xmath27-point parallelization is highly efficient to reduce the elapsed time .",
    "by combining the tetrahedron method with the cpt , we have introduced a method to numerically calculate the density of states of interacting fermions .",
    "the method removes the lorentzian broadening parameter @xmath0 to represent delta - function peaks and thus allows us to resolve fine structures of the density of states and evaluate a single - particle excitation gap without performing the extrapolation of @xmath1 .",
    "the formulation is based on the lehmann representation of the interacting single - particle green s function in the cpt .",
    "we have emphasized the notion of the effective single - particle hamiltonian for the single - particle excitation energies of interacting fermions , which is the conceptual basis of the proposed method and enables us to apply the tetrahedron method developed in the single - particle theory . the general correspondence between the self - energy and the effective single - particle hamiltonian has also been established .",
    "the formalism has been provided in detail for 2d multi - orbital interacting systems and the benchmark calculation has been performed for the 2d single - band hubbard model .",
    "the method can be easily adapted to symmetry broken states using the vca .",
    "we have also argued that extension of the formalism to 3d interacting systems is straightforward . for the finite - temperature calculation , the @xmath27-point parallelization to diagonalize the effective single - particle hamiltonian @xmath92 would be required because of the rapid increase of the dimension @xmath54 of @xmath92 with the temperature .",
    "not only the method itself but also the notion of the effective single - particle hamiltonian is a useful concept to investigate the single - particle excitations of interacting fermions in general .",
    "the computations have been done using the riken integrated cluster of clusters ( ricc ) facility and the riken supercomputer system ( hokusai greatwave ) .",
    "this work has been supported in part by grant - in - aid for scientific research from mext japan under the grant no .",

    "in this appendix , we first construct an effective single - particle hamiltonian whose eigenvalues coincide with the single - particle excitation energies of interacting fermions .",
    "next , we establish the general correspondence between the self - energy and the matrix elements of this effective single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "it should be emphasized that the formalism developed in this appendix is not specific to the cpt but relevant for any interacting fermions .    to simplify the notation , here",
    "we only consider a single - orbital system in a paramagnetic state .",
    "therefore , the single - particle green s function is independent of the spin directions , i.e. , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
