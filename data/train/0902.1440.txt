    "supernova ( sn ) 2006gy is an extremely luminous sn found by @xcite near the nucleus of the host galaxy ngc 1260 [ @xmath10 mag ] .",
    "its absolute magnitude reaches @xmath2 @xmath11 mag ( ofek et al . 2007 ; smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , being more luminous than typical type ia supernovae by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the sn was referred to as `` the most luminous sn '' at that time .",
    "in addition to the high peak luminosity , the light curve ( lc ) of sn 2006gy evolves very slowly , peaking at @xmath13 70 days after the explosion ( hereafter , @xmath14 means time after the explosion ) .",
    "the total radiation energy exceeds @xmath15 ergs , i.e. , comparable to the kinetic energy of typical sne .",
    "the optical spectra of sn 2006gy show type iin - like features , i.e. , narrow emissions of h balmer lines .    for a model of sn 2006gy , a ` type iia ' scenario ( hybrid of type iin and ia sn , like sne 2002ic and 1997cy ; deng et al . 2004 ) , i.e. , type ia sn in a dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) , has been suggested .",
    "however , the radiation energy of sn 2006gy is comparable to ( or overwhelming ) the kinetic energy of type ia sne so that this scenario seems unlikely ( ofek et al . 2007 ;",
    "smith et al .",
    "the progenitor of sn 2006gy should be a massive star .",
    "the source of the huge optical luminosity is under debate .",
    "possible mechanisms are ( i ) thermal emission from hydrogen recombination front , ( ii ) interaction between csm and sn ejecta , and ( iii ) radioactive decay of @xmath4ni  .",
    "ofek et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that the luminosity comes from the csm interaction , as in type iin / iia sne . on the contrary , smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that radioactive decay is the primal ( or least problematic ) heating source , because only weak x - rays were detected from sn 2006gy ( suggesting csm interaction was not strong ) and the observed expansion velocity of hydrogen envelope was unusually slow ( suggesting too small emitting radius for thermal radiation ) .",
    "agnoletto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) gave an idea that the massive csm was clumpy and both the csm interaction and the radioactive decay contributed to the enormous luminosity . furthermore , smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested that sn 2006gy is a pair - instability sn ( pisn ) because a huge amount of @xmath4ni  ( @xmath16 ) is required to explain the peak luminosity .",
    "however , nomoto et al . ( 2007 ) shows that the lc of the pisn model evolves too slowly to reproduce the observed lc .",
    "umeda & nomoto ( 2008 ) explored a possibility that core - collapse sne could synthesize such a large amount of @xmath4ni .",
    "woosley , blinnikov & heger ( 2007 ) showed that the collision between the shells ejected by pulsational pair instability in massive stars initially having @xmath17 could reproduce the peak luminosity of sn 2006gy .",
    "smith & mccray ( 2007 ) also presented a simple `` shell - shocked '' model involving shock - deposited energy as the heat source .",
    "in these two models , the shell is so thick that x - rays are absorbed .",
    "portegies zwart & van den heuvel ( 2007 ) suggested that the sn 2006gy was an outcome of merging between two massive stars in a dense and young cluster , being consistent with presence of a large amount of hydrogen .",
    "recently , smith et al .",
    "( 2008a ) presented results of late phase observations ( @xmath18@xmath19 days ) .",
    "the sn was clearly seen in nir images obtained with the adaptive optics on the keck ii telescope , while any optical observation failed to detect the sn component even for h@xmath7 emission .",
    "the nir flux would be attributed to newly - formed dust particles or an ir echo .",

    "for the high resolution spectroscopy , we used a @xmath33 width slit , a 665 lines mm@xmath6 volume - phase holographic grism and sy47 order - cut filter , which gives a wavelength coverage of 53007700   and a spectral resolution of @xmath34  .",
    "for the low resolution one , we used a @xmath35 width offset - slit , a 300 lines mm@xmath6 blue grism and sy47 filter , giving a wavelength coverage of 48009000   and a spectral resolution of @xmath36  .",
    "the total exposure time was 1200 s on each night .",
    "the direction of the slit was set to position angle ( pa ) @xmath37 to take spectra of both the nucleus of the host galaxy ngc 1260 and the sn simultaneously .",
    "flux calibration and the correction for atmospheric absorption bands were performed using spectra of a spectrophotometric standard star obtained on the same night ; bd @xmath38 in 2006 dec , feige 34 in 2007 jan and g191b2b in 2007 sep .",
    "the log of observation is shown in table [ tbl : obs ] .    for photometry , we took @xmath39 and @xmath3 band images just before the spectroscopy .",
    "the exposure times of @xmath39 and @xmath3 bands are 3 s and 4 s in 2006 dec , 5 s and 5 s in 2007 jan and 10 s and 10 s in 2007 sep , respectively .",
    "we used @xmath40 on - chip binning in the ccd readout and the resultant scale was 0208 per a binned - pixel .",
    "the magnitude of the sn is calibrated with landolt field stars ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "since the sn was very close to the bright nucleus of the host galaxy ( @xmath41 ) , the subtraction of the background component should be carefully performed , especially for late phase data .    in the earlier phase data ,",
    "the sn was sufficiently bright and the artificial error originated in the adopted method for the background subtraction is not significant .",
    "for photometry , we subtracted psf - matched 394 days image in the same band as the background , and then performed psf - photometry .",
    "although this method gives an over - subtraction due to a non - negligible sn component at @xmath42 394 days , the error should be small ( @xmath43 mag ) because the sn faded by about 4 mag between @xmath42 127 days and 394 days .",
    "the photometric error was derived from the root sum square of the magnitude transformation error using the landolt field stars and the photon noises of the sn and the background . for spectroscopy , we assumed that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectral image of the host galaxy is symmetric across the nucleus , and simply subtracted the mirrored spectral image across the nucleus .",
    "for the late phase data , we should mention at first that the sn component was successfully detected in both imaging ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flipsubim ] ) and spectroscopic ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2dspecim]a - d ) data , although smith et al .",
    "( 2008a ) and agnoletto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reported their null detection in optical data between @xmath44 and @xmath45 days .",
    "we assume that the better seeing condition at our observation enabled us to distinguish the sn component from the host galaxy nucleus . however , it is still a difficult task to derive the intrinsic sn component because the background galaxy has inhomogeneous structures .",
    "for photometry on @xmath42 394 days , we assumed a symmetry for the brightness distribution of the host galaxy with respect to its polar axis ( pa@xmath46 ) and adopted the mirrored image as the background for the lack of better alternatives . in the background - subtracted image ,",
    "the sn is seen nearly as a point - like source embedded in a diffuse elongated component ( fig [ fig : flipsubim ] ) .",
    "the psf - photometry for the sn and nearby two stars ( c1 and c2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flipsubim ] ) provided @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the sn , @xmath49 and @xmath50 for c1 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 for c2 .",
    "our preliminary aperture - photometry with several parameter sets ( radii of stellar aperture and sky annulus ) gave somewhat scattered values for the sn magnitudes , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , because of the inhomogeneous background .",
    "to check the reliability of the uncertainty , we added an artificial star having the same brightness at several positions near the sn and performed photometry of it .",
    "the result of this test was consistent with above photometry and we adopt @xmath53 and @xmath54 as the sn magnitude .",
    "it is noted that these magnitudes might be contaminated by unresolved background components , e.g. , regions and/or stellar clusters in the host galaxy , and thus they should be considered as the brighter limits . in the spectroscopic data , we estimated the background component using the neighboring regions on both sides of the sn position , bg1 and bg2 along the slit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slitpos ] and [ fig:2dspecim ] ) .",
    "since the simple mean of bg1 and bg2 spectra clearly leads to over - estimation of the background component ( i.e. , spatial distribution of the background component is no longer linear along the slit ) , we scaled the bg1 and bg2 spectra to match the sn flux at apparently line - free region , 78147856   rest wavelength before the averaging .",
    "the scaling factors and the scaled spectra of bg1 , bg2 and some other regions are shown in figures [ fig : specbackg]a .",
    "four background spectra ( bg1 , bg2 , galaxy core and mirror position ) resemble to one another and they are well explained by a slightly reddened bulge spectrum ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) . from these spectra ( including 2d spectral images in figure [ fig:2dspecim ] ) we recognize the existence of [ ] 7155 , [ ] 7300 and ir triplet emission lines in the sn spectrum .",
    "the enlarged spectra around h@xmath7 line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specbackg]b ) also implies the presence of an intermediate - width ( 1530  @xmath55 7001400 km  s@xmath6 ) h@xmath7 emission line .",
    "they are discussed later .",
    "finally , we adopted the mean of the scaled bg1 and bg2 spectra as the background component , and then subtracted it from the sn position spectrum to derive the pure sn spectrum .",
    "this method leads to complete elimination of the continuum component of the sn , at least , around the line - free regions .",
    "the resultant sn spectrum provides the faint - end limit of the magnitude of the sn as @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( as far as we ignore the contamination by the possible unresolved component as mentioned above ) , which are consistent with the results of our photometry .",
    "it is noted that there is a non - negligible difference between the normalized bg1 and bg2 spectra , especially at bluer wavelengths , which may lead to a large uncertainty for the resultant sn flux at @xmath25 days up to @xmath58% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specobs2 ] ) . this uncertainty is larger than the error of estimated extinction toward the sn ( see  [ sec : spec ] ) . in this paper",
    "we mainly discuss the emission line components at longer than 5800   for the late phase spectrum and therefore this uncertainty does not affect our discussion .",
    "figure [ fig : lcabs ] shows the @xmath3 band light curve ( lc ) of sn 2006gy constructed from the published data ( smith et al . 2007 ;",
    "agnoletto et al .",

    "there exists a large variety among the lcs of type iia and iin sne .",
    "the lc of sn iia 2002ic declines very slowly .",
    "the slope is flatter than that the lc powered by the @xmath4co  @xmath59 @xmath4fe  decay with fully trapped @xmath60-rays .",

    "2000 ; turatto et al . 1993 ; turatto et al .",
    "on the other hand , the lc of sn 1999el declines faster than sne 2002ic and 1998bw .",
    "similar behavior is also seen in the lc of type iin sn 1998s ( fassia et al .",
    "2000 ) . in another type iin",
    "sn 1994w , a sudden decline of the lc was observed after @xmath61 days plateau ( sollerman , cumming & lundqvist 1998 , chugai et al .",
    "the main heating source of type iin and iia sne is thought to be the interaction between sn ejecta and csm ( e.g. , turatto et al .",
    "1993 ; chugai et al .",
    "2004 ) , and this heterogeneity in the lc may reflect the structure , the mass and the kinetic energy of the sn ejecta as well as the structure ( density and its slope ) of csm .",
    "in contrast to type iin sne , the lcs of sne where @xmath4ni  is the dominant heating source show similar shapes .",
    "the lc declines faster than the @xmath4co  decay line because a fraction of @xmath60-rays escape without interacting with the sn ejecta .",
    "the deviation from the @xmath4co  decay line gradually becomes larger because the expanding sn ejecta gets thinner against @xmath60-rays .",
    "the lc of type ic sn 1998bw is fully explained by this scenario ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ; maeda et al .",

    "the early lc of sn 2006gy tends to be leveled around @xmath62 days .",
    "our subaru data shows that the lc fades by @xmath63 mag from @xmath64 to @xmath65 days , which is consistent with the results of nir photometry at @xmath66 and 468 days ( smith et al .",

    ", the lc of sn 2006gy does not show any particularly peculiar behavior that is not explained by the @xmath4co  decay .",

    "the model lc is in reasonably good agreement with our late phase observation .",
    "if we assume that the radioactive decay is the main energy source of emission at @xmath25 days , @xmath76 is needed to explain the @xmath3 band flux .",
    "although the model lc for sn iia 2002ic ( nomoto et al . 2005 ) is not consistent with that of sn  2006gy , we can not preclude the csm interaction model because of the large diversity of lcs in type iin / iia sne .",
    "we note that the model by woosley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is also consistent with our observation .",
    "however , the diffusion model by smith & mccray ( 2007 ) , predicting a fast decline after the maximum ( @xmath77 mag at @xmath78 days ) , is inconsistent with our data .",
    "also , the lcs of the pisn model ( blue dashed line ) is not consistent with the observed lc .",
    "the spectra of sn 2006gy are shown in figure [ fig : specobs ] , and closed - up profiles of some lines are shown in figure [ fig : specvel ] .",
    "the redshift @xmath79 , derived from the diffuse h@xmath7 emission line of the host galaxy ( cf . @xmath80 derived at the nucleus ) , has been corrected for .",
    "we assumed the total extinction of @xmath81 ( or @xmath82 ) toward the sn , which is the sum of the extinction in the milky way [ @xmath83 ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ] and that within the host galaxy [ @xmath84 , derived from @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; smith et al .",

    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of the galactic d@xmath87d@xmath88 absorption lines in our high resolution spectrum ( ew@xmath89  ) is almost consistent with @xmath83 using an empirical relation of @xmath90( ) suggested by turatto , benetti , & cappellaro ( 2003 ) .",
    "although the ew of the host galaxy d line in the same spectrum suggests a larger extinction within the host galaxy ( @xmath91 ) , it should be partly circumstellar origin because some of other spectral features ( h@xmath7 and ) are accompanied with narrow absorption components in their p - cyg type profiles .",
    "our late time spectrum suffers from large uncertainty in the ew of d line because of the faint sn spectrum and the uncertain continuum level ( see  [ sec : backsub ] ) .    like other type - iin sne ,",
    "our early phase spectra of sn 2006gy are characterized by a strong h@xmath7 emission line as well as many , and lines .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : specvel ] , the h@xmath7 emission line in the spectra at @xmath30 days has a narrow p - cyg type component near the peak , of which the marginally resolved emission line has a width of @xmath92 km  s@xmath6  fwhm , and a broad wing component exceeding @xmath93 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the broad component is clearly asymmetric , being brighter in the red wing than in the blue .",

    "this asymmetric profile was seen through @xmath31 days , although the absorption component became less significant .",
    "for some features , e.g. , 5535 and d at @xmath30 days , broad blue - shifted absorption components up to @xmath97 km  s@xmath6  are also significant ( fig .",

    "the narrow absorption component of the h@xmath7 peak considerably evolved from @xmath94 to 157 days .",

    "the presence of the forbidden [ ] 7155 and [ ] 7302 lines suggests the density of the emitting region in sn 2006gy is less than those in other type iin / iia sne .",
    "however , it is likely that the density is still higher than those of other type sne ; the line flux ratio @xmath117 of sn 2006gy is only @xmath118 ( table [ tbl : unident_line ] ) , while @xmath119 in sne of other types ( fig .",
    "[ fig : speccomp1 ] and [ fig : speccomp3 ] ; see also gmez & lpez 2000 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath120 suggests an electron density of the emitting region @xmath121@xmath122 @xmath123 ( ferland & persson 1989 ; fransson & chevalier 1989 ) . this is consistent with the existence of the [ ] 7155 because its critical density of electron is not so small ( a few times @xmath124 @xmath123 ; zickgraf 2003 ) . in such a high density region , the forbidden line [ ] 6300 , 6364 would be effectively quenched , because its critical density is only a few times @xmath125 @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the low @xmath117 value and the absence of [ ] 6300 , 6364 in sn 2006gy can be qualitatively explained by a moderately high electron density of the emitting region , which would be less than those of type iin / iia sne and more than other type ii and ib / c sne .    in such a high density environment , emission could occur in permitted multiplets ( e.g. , turrato et al . 2000 ; deng et al .",
    "2004 ) , which might contribute to the blue continuum flux at @xmath126  .",
    "the absence of intermediate - width [ ] line around 5200   , which is seen together with [ ] 7155 in type ia sne as well as in the peculiar type ic sn 1998bw ( fig .",
    "[ fig : speccomp3 ] ) , might be explained by this higher density assumption .",
    "the high density of the ejecta is also consistent with the current understanding that the @xmath4ni  heating model requires a massive progenitor and a large amount of ejecta ( umeda & nomoto 2008 ) .",
    "a large ejecta mass is also needed to reproduce the long duration of the lc around maximum .",
    "the high density of the ejecta would also be consistent with the lower expansion velocity ( @xmath127 km  s@xmath6 ) derived from fwhm of the emission lines in the late time spectrum .",
    "low expansion velocity was also suggested from early spectroscopy ( ofek et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "there are several unusual features in the late time spectrum of sn 2006gy ( marked with dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : specobs2 ] ) .",
    "these lines are not clearly seen in other types of sne ( fig .",
    "[ fig : speccomp1][fig : speccomp3 ] ) .",
    "consulting line lists in literature ( e.g. , moore 1945 ) , we find possible candidates as shown in table [ tbl : unident_line ] .",
    "some of them could be lines of nickel ( [ ] 7380 , 8704 ; [ ] 7394 , 7908 , 8202 , 8843 ) and/or titanium ( [ ] 7917 , 8040 , 8060 , 8349 , 8371 ) .",
    "the emission line at 7716   could be due to iron ( [ ] 7709 or [ ] 7765 ) .",
    "if these identifications are correct , the innermost ejecta of sn 2006gy was visible at @xmath25 days because ni and ti are likely to exist only inner part of the ejecta . assuming that the line emitting region expands homologously with @xmath128 km s@xmath6 and all the elements are singly ionized , the high density ( @xmath124 @xmath129 @xmath123 ) implies that the mass of the hypothetical innermost region is @xmath20.88@xmath130 ( if dominated by fe - peak elements ) or @xmath20.33@xmath130 ( if dominated by ca ) .",
    "this would suggest that the assumption of @xmath131 @xmath123 is reasonable . in this case , the electron scattering optical depth is @xmath20.22 , which suggests that @xmath131 is also necessary for the innermost region to be optically thin . in sum , our hypothesis of the emergence of the innermost part requires @xmath131 @xmath123 , being consistent with the high density interpretation",
    ".    however , the identification of these lines are still tentative .",
    "for example , we do not see the [ ] 7507 feature in the observed spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specobs2 ] ) , although it is expected to emit as strong as the [ ] 7908 .",
    "it is noted the feature around 7910   is also seen in some type ia sne ( fig .",
    "[ fig : speccomp3 ] ) .",
    "there is also an overall resemblance with the peculiar type ia sn 2005hk at 240 days , especially at 55006000   , 71007500   and 85008900   ( fig .",
    "[ fig : speccomp3 ] ) . to discuss this subject further , a more reliable identification of these lines will be needed .",
    "we presented the spectroscopic and photometric observation of luminous type iin sn 2006gy at @xmath25 days .",
    "the good seeing condition enabled us to detect it in the optical wavelengths .",
    "the overall lc is roughly consistent with the radioactive heating model .",
    "the deviation between the observed lc and the radioactive lc model around 200 days suggests that the strong csm interaction considerably contributed at @xmath2 200 days and then weakened by 394 days .",
    "the late time spectrum of sn 2006gy was unique .",
    "it showed some emission lines with intermediate width ( @xmath5 km  s@xmath6 ) , including forbidden lines of [ ] and [ ] which are not seen in normal type iin / iia sne .",
    "the absence of [ ] 6300 , 6364 line and the weakness of [ ] lines would be a result of moderate electron density of @xmath132@xmath122 @xmath123 in the emission line region .",
    "this is consistent with the larger amount of ejecta and less expansion velocity suggested for this sn .",
    "although sn 2006gy exhibited possible h@xmath7 emission line , its flux was considerably lower than those of type iin / iia sne and rather comparable with that of a typical type ii sn .",
    "this suggests that the strong csm interaction has finished by @xmath25 days , being consistent with the prediction from the lc .",
    "several unusual emission features were present at 74008800  and some of them might be ni and/or ti lines",
