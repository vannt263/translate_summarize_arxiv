    "the advantage of this approach is that one knows the origin of the effective gravity theory in the bulk and the details of the dual field theory .",
    "one of the well - known examples in this category is the duality between the iib superstring theory on the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theory on the @xmath3 boundary . on the other hand , in the so - called bottom - up approach , the gravity theory in the hulk",

    "the models constructed in this way are simple and universal , just like the landau - ginzburg theory describing superconductivity .",
    "the disadvantage is that the details of the dual field theory are not very clear .",
    "a well known example in the second category is the holographic superconductor model  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , to build a holographic superconductor model , one should first introduce a u(1 ) gauge field in the bulk , which corresponds to a global u(1 ) symmetry in the boundary side . to break this u(1 ) symmetry spontaneously",
    ", one needs a charged operator condensing at low temperature .",
    "therefore , one includes a charged scalar field in the bulk which is dual to the boundary scalar operator . for simplicity , the gauge field and the charged scalar can be minimally coupled .",

    "the order parameter in a superconductor is expressed in terms of the gap function .",
    "due to the anti - commuting properties of the electron wave function , the antisymmetric spin - singlet state is associated with a symmetric orbital wave function with orbital angular momentum @xmath6 ( s - wave ) , 2 ( d - wave ) , etc , while the symmetric spin - triplet state is accompanied by an antisymmetric orbital wave function with orbital angular momentum @xmath7 ( p - wave ) , 3 ( f - wave ) , etc .",
    "since the condensed field in the holographic setup  @xcite is a scalar field dual to a scalar operator in the field theory side , it is therefore a holographic s - wave model . in the holographic setup ,",

    "for this , we turn on a uniform magnetic field @xmath10 in the bulk , which immerses the condensed phase into an external magnetic field .",
    "we find that the increase of the magnetic field induces the instability of the black hole background , which gives rise to a family of condensate induced by the applied magnetic field in the dual strongly coupled system .",

    "for finite magnetic field , there is a tower of  droplet \" solutions  @xcite in the sense that they are localized in a finite region .",

    "possible experimental evidence for the strong magnetic induced superconductivity can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "it was also shown in gross - neveu type model that applied magnetic field might induce superconductivity in the planar system with 4-fermion interaction  @xcite .",
    "we mention here that similar studies can also be generalized other gravitational backgrounds , such as the ads soliton background which has been adopted to mimic superconductor / insulator phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the study of magnetic field effect in the superconductor / insulator case can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a forthcoming paper  @xcite",
    ", we generalize the present study to the case with the ads soliton as the background .",
    "it is found that the magnetic field can induce the instabilities of the ads soliton background . comparing our model with the su(2 ) model with a constant non - abelian magnetic field  @xcite , we find that our complex vector field model in some sense is a generalization of the su(2 ) model to the case with a general mass squared @xmath114 and magnetic moment characterized by @xmath22 . in the setup of the present paper , the su(2 ) model corresponds to our model with @xmath161 and @xmath162 .    in this paper , we restricted ourselves to the probe approximation , neglecting the effect of matter fields on the background geometry .",
    "this can indeed reveal some significant properties of the model , but something might be lost in this approximation , see ref .",
    "@xcite as an example .",
    "it is therefore helpful to understand full properties of the model by considering the back reaction of matter fields on the background geometry . in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "going beyond the probe approximation , we found a rich phase structure in this model without magnetic field .",
    "depending on mass square @xmath114 and charge @xmath21 of the vector field , not only second order but also first order and zeroth order phase transition can appear .",
    "interestingly , there also exists a so - called `` retrograde condensation '' in which the hairy solution exists only for temperatures above a critical value and is thermodynamically subdominant .",
    "particularly , the zeroth order transition and retrograde condensation can be observed for the case with small @xmath114 .",
    "indeed this model has much more phase behaviors than the su(2 ) model , thus it can be used to mimic much richer phenomena in dual strongly coupled systems .    in our model",
    ", it is the magnetic field itself that can induce the condensate .",
    "a natural question arises how about the meissner effect known as that superconductors expel weak external magnetic field .",
    "this effect is due to the large superconducting currents induced in the superconductor by the external magnetic field , which generates a back - reacting magnetic field screening the external magnetic field . in the holographic su(2 )",
    "p - wave model , it has been pointed out  @xcite that the vortex currents flow in the opposite direction to the one in conventional superconductors , thus can enhance the applied magnetic field in the regions between the vortices .",
    "it seems that the model presented here is similar to the su(2 ) p - wave model .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether a similar phenomenon also appears in our model . to answer this question ,",
    "we need to consider the contribution of higher order terms in  , which is also required to find the true vortex flux lattice .",
    "we leave it for further study .    in this paper",
    "we only calculated the conductivity in the case without magnetic field in one spatial direction . although it is enough to see the superconductivity feature of the condensed phase , in order to study the model in a more realistic manner , it is desirable to calculate the conductivity in another direction and further to study the transport properties of the lattice state . as a phenomenological approach ,",
    "this toy model would have potential application to mimic strongly coupled systems with a vector like order parameter .",
    "it should be applicable in a wide variety of condensed matter systems , heavy ion physics and beyond .",
    "we hope to report further progresses in future .",

    "as a toy model with a charged vector field in the bulk dual to a vector operator in the field theory , there exists the possibility that the condensate of this vector field can serve as an order parameter to mimic a holographic p - wave superconductor phase transition , like the s - wave case  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we hope that this system has stable black hole solutions with vector hair at low temperatures , but without vector hair at high temperatures .",
    "if this is true , in the condensed phase , the condensate of the dual vector operator will break not only the u(1 ) symmetry but also the rotational symmetry since the condensate of vector field picks out one special direction .",

    "fitting the curve near the critical temperature @xmath132 , we find that for small condensate there is a critical behavior with critical exponent @xmath186 , which precisely meets the result given by mean field theory and it is typically a second order phase transition . in the case with @xmath118 we obtain @xmath187 thus we have obtained two black hole solutions in the system .",
    "when @xmath188 , we have the black hole solution without the vector field , while we have the black hole solution with non - trivial vector field as @xmath189 .",
