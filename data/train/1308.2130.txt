    "the new observation of the system j1614 - 2230  @xcite has brought a great impact on the maximum - mass problem of neutron stars .",
    "the large observed value of neutron - star mass @xmath0 gives a severe condition for the stiffness of the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron - star matter .",
    "for realization of the nuclear saturation property based on underlying nuclear interactions , an essential role is played by the three - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) interaction ( tni ) composed of the attractive part ( tna ) and the repulsive part ( tnr ) .",
    "especially , the tnr contribution increasing rapidly in the high - density region leads to a high values of nuclear incompressibility : the tnr contribution in high - density neutron matter plays an essential role for stiffening of the eos of neutron - star matter , assuring the observed maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "however , the hyperon ( @xmath2 ) mixing in neutron - star matter brings about the remarkable softening of the eos , which cancels the tnr effect for the maximum mass . in order to avoid this serious problem , nishizaki , takatsuka and one of the authors ( y.y . )",
    "@xcite introduced the conjecture that the tnr - type repulsions work universally for @xmath3 and @xmath4 as well as for @xmath5 .",
    "they showed that the role of the tnr for stiffening the eos can be recovered clearly by this assumption .",
    "our basic concern is the existence of universal repulsions among three baryons , called here as the three - baryon repulsion ( tbr ) .    in modeling for @xmath3 and @xmath4 interactions ,",
    "important development has been accomplished by the extended soft core ( esc ) models . here , two - meson and meson - pair exchanges are taken into account explicitly and no effective boson is included differently from the usual one - boson exchange models . the latest version of esc model is named as esc08c  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , esc means this version . in this work",
    ", tbr is taken into account by the multi - pomeron exchange potential ( mpp ) within the esc modeling . in order to reproduce the nuclear saturation property",
    "precisely , it is necessary to introduce also tna .",
    "we treat this part phenomenologically .",
    "the g - matrix theory gives a good starting point for studies of many - body systems on the basis of free - space baryon - baryon interaction models .",
    "here , the correlations induced by short - range and tensor components are renormalized into g - matrix interactions . in the case of nucleon matter",
    ", the lowest - order g - matrix calculations with the continuous ( con ) choice for intermediate single particle potentials were shown to simulate well the results including higher hole - line contributions up to @xmath6 times of normal density @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of this recognition , one can study properties of high - density nuclear matter using the lowest - order g - matrix theory with the con choice .    one of great successes of the g - matrix approach is that nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus scattering observables are nicely reproduced with the complex g - matrix folding potentials derived from free - space @xmath5 interactions . in ref.@xcite , it was shown clearly that the tnr effect appeared in angular distributions of @xmath8o+@xmath8o elastic scattering ( @xmath9=70 mev ) , @xmath10 .",
    "their analysis is used here to determine the coupling constants in mpp : the g - matrix folding potentials including mpp contributions are used to analyze the @xmath8o+@xmath8o scattering , and then the strengths of mpp are adjusted so as to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "many attempts have been made to extract some information on the incompressibility @xmath11 of high - density matter formed in high - energy central heavy - ion collisions . in many cases ,",
    "however , the results for the eos still remain inconclusive . on the other hand ,",
    "it was pointed out that folding - model analyses of high - precision nuclear scattering data can be used as an independent method to determine the value of @xmath11 , which was demonstrated with use of density - dependent interactions  @xcite .",
    "our approach can be considered as a development from theirs : the mpp contributions determined by analyses with the g - matrix folding model are included in constructing the eos of neutron - star matter , which is expected to result in a stiff eos , enough to give the observed neutron - star mass .",
    "the important feature of our mpp is that it works universally not only in @xmath12 states but also @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 states .",
    "it will be shown in our future work that inclusions of mpp s in hypernuclear calculations lead to reasonable results .",
    "we introduce the universal tbr consistently with the esc modeling , assuming that the dominant mechanism is triple and quartic pomeron exchange . for the n - tuple pomeron vertex generally , we take the lagrangian @xmath16 the n - body local potential by pomeron exchange is @xmath17 @xmath18{\\cal m}^{4 - 3n } , \\ ] ] where the ( low - energy ) pomeron propagator is the same as used in the two - body pomeron potential . since the pomeron is an su(3)-singlet , mpp s work universally among baryons",
    ".    the effective two - body potential in a baryonic medium is obtained by integrating over the coordinates @xmath19 .",
    "this gives @xmath20 @xmath21 being a nuclear - matter density .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the triple and quartic pomeron couplings .",
    "values of mpp strengths @xmath22 can be estimated from the experimental cross sections of the process @xmath23 ( diffractive production of showers of particles ) at very high energies  @xcite : the estimated values are @xmath24 . using the value of @xmath25 used in esc",
    ", we have @xmath26 in the reggeon field theory  @xcite , the value of @xmath27 can be estimated as @xmath28",
    "in @xcite the complex g - matrix interaction was derived from the esc model including tnr , and nucleus - nucleus elastic scatterings were analyzed with the use of double - folding potentials . in this work",
    ", the tnr effect was assumed to come from the medium effect on the vector - meson masses differently from the present mpp model .",
    "when a scattering energy is high enough , the frozen - density approximation gives a good prescription . in this approximation ,",
    "g - matrices at about two times of normal density contribute to folding potentials .",
    "then , the tnr effects were shown to appear clearly in angular distributions in the case of @xmath8o@xmath29o elastic scattering at @xmath30 mev , and also in the cases of @xmath8o elastic scattering by the @xmath31c , @xmath32si and @xmath33ca at @xmath34 mev , and @xmath31c@xmath35c elastic scattering at @xmath36 mev . here , the same analyses are performed so that the mpp strengths @xmath22 and @xmath27 are determined to reproduce the experimental data with the use of the g - matrix folding potential derived from esc including mpp .    on the other hand , the nuclear saturation property can not be reproduced only by adding mpp to esc .",
    "then , we introduce also a tna part phenomenologically as a density - dependent two - body interaction @xmath37 here , because the functional form is not determined within our analysis , it is fixed to be similar to the tna part given in @xcite . only the strength @xmath38 is treated as an adjustable parameter .",
    "this tna is assumed to work only in even states : an odd - state tna contributes to the @xmath8o@xmath29o potential at @xmath30 mev more than the nuclear - matter energy , because g - matrices in the former are with higher momenta than those in the latter .",
    "therefore , they can not be reproduced consistently , for instance , with use of a wigner - type tna .",
    "also the fujita - miyazawa tna used in @xcite is specified by dominant contributions from even - state components .    on the basis of g - matrix calculations , strengths of the tnr part ( @xmath22 and @xmath27 ) and the tna part ( @xmath38 )",
    "are determined so as to reproduce the @xmath8o@xmath29o angular distribution @xmath30 mev and the minimum value @xmath39 mev of the energy per nucleon at normal density in symmetric matter .",
    "because the ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath27 can not be determined in our analysis , it is taken adequately referring the above estimation based on @xcite . then , we have ( @xmath22 , @xmath27)= ( 2.34 , 30.0 ) and @xmath40 mev .",
    "this set is called as mp1a . in order to see a role of @xmath27 especially in high - density region , we take here another set ( @xmath22 , @xmath27)= ( 2.94 , 0.0 ) with the same value of @xmath38 . this set without @xmath27",

    "solid and dashed curves are for mp1a and mp2a , respectively , which are found to fit the data nicely . though reduction factors are often multiplied on the imaginary parts in the folding model analyses  @xcite , such a reduction factor is not used in the present analysis . the necessity to include the quartic pomeron coupling has to appear in the difference between results for mp1a and mp2a , but it can not be found in the present analyses for nucleus - nucleus scattering .",

    "the box in the figure show the area where nuclear saturation is expected to occur empirically .",

    "then , the saturation density and the minimum energy in symmetric matter are found to be deviated substantially from the box .",
    "solid and dashed curves are for mp1a and mp2a , respectively . as seen clearly ,",
    "saturation densities and minimum values in these cases are close nicely to the empirical value shown by the box . then , obtained values of incompressibility @xmath11 are 280 mev and 270 mev at minimum point in the cases of including mp1a and mp2a , respectively . which are comparable to the empirical value @xmath42 mev  @xcite .",

    "these values are in nice agreement to the values @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev determined recently on the basis of experimental data  @xcite .",
