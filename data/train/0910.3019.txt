    "hayashi and shimokawa @xcite created a version of thin position which combines the notion of thin position for a knot or link in @xmath7 @xcite with thin position for a 3manifold @xcite .",
    "they prove an analogue of a famous theorem of casson and gordon @xcite for their version of thin position . informally",
    ": if a bridge surface for a link in a 3manifold can be untelescoped then either the bridge position was not `` minimal '' or there is an essential closed or meridional surface in the exterior of the link .",
    "the arguments in @xcite rely heavily on other work @xcite which classifies heegaard splittings of certain 1manifolds in certain 3manifolds .",
    "these classification theorems are used to understand what happens if every component of a thin surface is boundary parallel in the exterior of the 1manifold .    in @xcite , scharlemann and thompson defined thin position for a graph in the 3sphere ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "applications have included a new proof of the classification of heegaard splittings of @xmath7 and a theorem about levelling unknotting tunnels of tunnel number one knots and links .",
    "li @xcite used thin position for graphs to show that if for a graph in the 3sphere thin position is not equal to bridge position then there is an essential meridional or almost meridional planar surface in its exterior .",
    "although the definition for thin position of a graph in @xmath7 can be easily adapted to define thin position for a graph in any 3manifold , this definition has not been much used . in @xcite , we extend hayashi and shimokawa s definition of thin position for a link in a 3manifold to graphs in a 3manifold .",
    "we use this definition to prove a casson - gordon type theorem which says ( informally ) that either thin position for a graph in a 3manifold is bridge position , or there exists an essential meridional or closed surface in its complement , or one or more various degenerate situations occur .",
    "this theorem generalizes both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "just as hayashi and shimokawa s work in @xcite rests on the classification results in @xcite , all of which are quite technical , so our result in @xcite rests on the classification results of this paper .",
    "one odd feature of this paper is that ( in some situations ) to classify splittings for a certain type of graph in a certain type of 3manifold it is helpful to make the graph more complicated by adding certain types of edges .",
