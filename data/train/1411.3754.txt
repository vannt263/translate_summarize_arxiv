    "recently , there has been much progress in our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum domain .",
    "particular emphasis has been put on deriving fundamental bounds on how much work can precisely be extracted in a thermodynamical process under meaningful assumptions .",
    "these bounds are indeed understood as the second law of thermodynamics in thomson s formulation .",
    "progress has been made specifically in deriving bounds that apply to the most general scenarios , including non - equilibrium states @xcite , account for work fluctuations @xcite , and more general classes of interactions between the working system and the heat bath @xcite .",
    "clearly , in any real experiment , one will face various specific limitations on the allowed operations , rendering it in general impossible to saturate the second law . in most cases these are limitations that pertain to the particular technological implementation of the thermal machine and do not encode any fundamental limitation in the same way the second law does .",
    "nonetheless , specially when dealing with systems at the scale where quantum effects become relevant , it seems imperative to consider general classes of limitations on the control of the systems used in the protocol of work extraction .",
    "these limitations are not specific to the substrate or the technology employed , but are of fundamental nature as they will naturally emerge in any conceivable implementation .",
    "thus , the tighter bounds derived on the extractable work when accounting for such limitations should indeed be understood as quantum versions of the second law , in the sense that they encode the ultimate bounds conceivable when making use of small systems .",

    "then we will turn to studying two fundamental limitations that emerge ubiquitously :    * bounds on the maximum energy gap of the hamiltonians in @xmath4 and * having only access to change the local hamiltonians of many - body systems .",
    "these limitations are introduced in a completely generic fashion , without making reference to any particular model .",
    "thus , they encode fundamental limitations known to be present in any implementation .    regarding the limitations of the class ii )",
    ", we will consider different scenarios that model the degree of control that the experimenter has over the bath s degrees of freedom .",
    "the simplest model , corresponding to the absence of any fine - tuned control , is thermal contact ( tc ) which merely thermalises the system at the bath s temperature . at the opposite end of the hierarchy of meaningful models of system - bath contacts",
    "are the so - called thermal operations ( to ) , where full control is assumed on all the degrees of freedom of the heat bath @xcite .",
    "our main result is to derive a general second law for the case of most physical relevance , where constraints i ) and ii ) come into play .",
    "we identify a bound to the maximum extractable work when the hamiltonians are restricted to a class @xmath4 and the interaction with the bath is modeled by tc .",
    "our result applies to initial and final states out of equilibrium and non - cyclic processes .",
    "this bound is then used to study how the different limitations interplay with each other when they are relaxed .",
    "in particular , it is has previously been shown that the limitations of the class ii ) alone do not tighten the bounds on work extraction @xcite .",
    "this observation  which encodes the surprising fact that having complete control over the heat bath offers no advantage  has diminished the interest on comparing different models for the degree of control over the bath , since it is seemed irrelevant to the problem of work extraction .",
    "however , we show that the situation is radically different in the presence of limitations : control over the bath s degree of freedom is advantageous for work extraction if other restrictions are simultaneously imposed , namely , i.a ) and i.b ) @xcite .",
    "we consider a finite - dimensional quantum system , initially described by a pair @xmath5 of an initial quantum state @xmath6 and an initial hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "this system can undergo an arbitrary _ protocol _ consisting of two types of operations .",
    "the first kind of operation is a _ unitary time - evolution _ for some time @xmath8 , corresponding to a transformation @xmath9 @xmath10 reflecting the unitary time - evolution under a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath11 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "we will now introduce a first class of restrictions on the control : we model the lack of control over the system by restricting the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath14 to a set @xmath15 which in general depends on the initial hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath16 for all times @xcite .",
    "we will assume that every such operation costs an amount of average work given by the difference of the system s average energy @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the second kind of allowed operations models the coupling of the system to heat baths at some _ fixed _ inverse temperature @xmath18 . given that the work cost at subsequent operations of the kind does not depend on the state of the bath , but on the state of the system , it suffices to describe the thermal contact as an effective quantum map on the system : we allow that , at any time @xmath19 , a quantum channel @xmath20 can be applied , resulting in a transformation of the form @xmath21 in general we will refer to such quantum channels as _ thermalizing maps_. @xmath20 models",
    "the effective time - evolution of the system when it is put in contact with a bath at time @xmath19 and does not cost any work .",
    "the specific form of @xmath20 will depend not only on @xmath14 , but also on the heat bath that is considered and the way one makes it interact with the system .",
    "this is mathematically expressed by restricting the map to be in a particular set , i.e. @xmath22 . the choice of @xmath23 encodes in which way we model the bath and the degree of control over it to implement a given interaction with the system .",
    "the minimal assumption on the set of maps @xmath23 , is that any @xmath22 leaves the thermal state of the system invariant , @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the gibbs state of the system at inverse temperature @xmath18 .",
    "we will also express this by saying that the thermalizing maps are _ gibbs - preserving _",
    "condition is necessary since if it would be violated , one could create states out of equilibrium from thermal states , which would make work extraction trivial in the sense that it can be performed without expenditure of resources . nonetheless , even if condition is satisfied , implementing an arbitrary gibbs - preserving map requires in general high degree of control over the degrees of freedom of the thermal bath , which may be in most situations of interest unrealistic .",
    "the second kind of restrictions that we consider will be concerned with physically meaningful limitations on such control , which will determine in turn a restricted set of maps @xmath23 .",
    "we now define a protocol of work extraction @xmath26 as an arbitrary finite sequence of operations as in eqs .   and , from an initial condition @xmath27 to a final @xmath28",
    ". the total amount of work extracted will be the sum of the work extracted in each operation and it will depend on both the initial and final condition and the protocol @xmath26 . this protocol will involve allowed operations that respect the potential physical constraints on @xmath4 and makes use of thermalizing maps @xmath29 ; we denote the set of all protocols fulfilling such constraints by @xmath30 .",
    "these limitations have an impact on the optimal work that can be extracted @xmath31 usually , it is of particular relevance to bound the maximum work that can be extracted from a given initial condition @xmath32 in a cyclic protocol where @xmath33 because of its relation with the formulation of the second law ; in such case we will simply use the notation @xmath34",
    "we now turn to discussing the considered models for the set of _ thermalizing maps _",

    "this set of maps merely contains one single element that maps every state to the gibbs state at the bath s temperature .",
    "this is the map implemented by a sufficiently long time evolution under a sufficiently weak arbitrary system - bath interaction @xcite . as such",
    ", it requires no control over the degrees of freedom of the heat bath .    the second class of operations that we consider is constituted by thermal operations ( to ) .",
    "they depend on the hamiltonian @xmath38 of the particular bath at hand and are defined as @xmath39 for any unitary @xmath40 so that @xmath41=0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "thermal operations have originally been introduced in the framework of _ single - shot _ thermodynamics , albeit for the same reason that we use them here : they model precisely the case of arbitrary control over system and heat bath when energy and entropy are conserved exactly . for convenience",
    "we will collect all thermalizing maps fulfilling the gibbs - preserving condition w.r.t .",

    "then we have the strict inclusions @xcite @xmath43 .",
    "we are now in position to state the second law in terms of work - extraction as @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this bound has been shown before @xcite , but for convenience of the reader we give a proof in section [ sec : aberg ] .    in the remainder of this work",
    "we will study how restrictions on the sets @xmath15 and @xmath47 interplay and influence the maximum value for work extraction @xmath48 in eq .  .",
    "in particular , we will now derive the form of the second law when both restrictions on @xmath23 and @xmath4 come into play .",

    "the initial step of the protocol must be given by unitary dynamics , since otherwise no work can be extracted : if we first thermalise , we effectively start from the gibbs state and no work can be extracted from a gibbs state at the same temperature as the heat bath .",
    "we will therefore assume that the protocol starts with unitary dynamics .",
    "we will write @xmath58 for the quantum state and hamiltonian prior to the @xmath59-th thermalisation .",
    "we hence have that @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the unitary that implements the time - dependent hamiltonian dynamics starting after the @xmath59-th thermalisation and ending right before the @xmath63-th thermalisation .",
    "we assume that our protocol consists of @xmath64 thermalisations and that , without loss of generality , the last step in the protocol is unitary dynamics . the total work is then given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 being defined as @xmath67",
    ". we will now reformulate this expression in terms of the free energy .",
    "given any two hamiltonians @xmath68 and @xmath69 we have @xmath70 the first equality follows from applying the definition @xmath71 and using that @xmath72 and @xmath73 have the same entropy .",
    "the inequality then follows from the fact that @xmath74 for every @xmath51 .",
    "now let us apply this inequality to , to obtain @xmath75 where eq",
    ".   follows again from the definition of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78 we can minimise @xmath79 over all possible states in @xmath80(\\rho_{{0}})$ ] and @xmath81 over all hamiltonians in @xmath82 to get the desired bound .    to show that the bound is achievable let us recall @xcite that a slow change of hamiltonians from @xmath81 to @xmath83  slow in the sense that the system is always in the thermal state for the given hamiltonian at that time  has a work cost of @xmath84 .",
    "such a protocol is achievable to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "the bound given by can be nicely interpreted by first noting that if @xmath15 is unrestricted , the infimum - term in the bound is zero as any state can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a gibbs state .",
    "hence , we obtain the usual second law given by a difference of the non - equilibrium free energies @xcite .",
    "thus , the infimum - term in should be interpreted as a penalty that emerges as a consequence of the limitations on control .",
    "lastly , in order to let the penalty term vanish , it suffices to take @xmath4 unrestricted ( while @xmath23 is restricted ) ; this fact may be lead one to the conclusion that the limitations on the bath control given by @xmath23 are indeed irrelevant for work extraction .",
    "we will now show that this is general not the case .",
    "the previous findings have a remarkable consequence that has , to the best of our our knowledge , not been noted before : if no other restrictions are put onto the valid operations , having control over the degrees of freedom of the heat bath is useless when it comes to work extraction .",
    "this is an astonishing fact , given that this holds regardless of the size , hamiltonian , model or substrate that we use to describe the heat bath .",
    "thus , controlling its degrees of freedom may be an enormous technological challenge that increases the valid set of operations , while not being useful at all for the main task in thermodynamics , i.e. , work extraction :    if @xmath15 is the set of all hamiltonians , protocols employing thermalizing maps of the form @xmath55 or @xmath85 , both achieve the same maximum work .",
    "that is , @xmath86.[obs : obs ]    this follows straightforwardly from the results in ref .",
    "@xcite which state that the maximum work by using gibbs - preserving maps is given by @xmath87 ; together with the usual second law for non equilibrium states in the presence of thermal contact @xmath88 , as it follows also from .",
    "observation [ obs : obs ] should not be confused with the _ maximum - work principle _ @xcite .",
    "we will now discuss particular examples and show that indeed the universality of tc for work extraction is only valid when no other restrictions are imposed , inequivalent with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the maximum - work principle is shown to not apply in certain situations .",
    "we will now provide a general argument allowing to understand why thermal contact ceases to be universal within scenarios where restrictions on @xmath4 are imposed . to understand it , it is necessary to recapitulate what the optimal cyclic protocol in the tc - setting without constraints on the hamiltonians does .",
    "we denote such an optimal protocol by @xmath89 .",
    "it consists of two parts .",
    "the first is to apply a transformation @xmath90 , with @xmath91 such that @xmath92 ( to arbitrary accuracy ) . since the initial state @xmath6 is already in the gibbs form for hamiltonian @xmath91 , putting it in wtc with the bath after this first step does not produce any heat dissipation .",
    "the second part is a sequence of transformations of the kind @xmath93 , followed each by tc with the bath , so that the hamiltonian goes back from @xmath91 to @xmath7 . in the limit of infinite number of steps ,",
    "the second part is a quasi - static transformation along an iso - thermal .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath89 extracts @xmath94 as work @xcite .    in the case where @xmath4 does constrain the set of allowed hamiltonians ,",
    "the first step of the optimal protocol is in general not possible . for a given @xmath95 there might be no hamiltonian @xmath91 in @xmath96 such that @xmath92 .",
    "an example is the scenario in which the hamiltonians in @xmath15 are all diagonal in the same basis but @xmath6 has a lot of coherences in this basis .",
    "this effect gives rise to the penalty term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxworkbound ] ) , which can , in the most drastic cases , diminish the maximal amount of extracted work to zero .",
    "now consider the setting where the bath is modelled by more general thermalizing maps , say @xmath97 , and assume there is indeed no hamiltonian @xmath98 such that @xmath92 .",
    "then the free energy bound can not be saturated by a protocol using weak thermal contact . in this",
    "setting , however , we may be able to use a thermal map from @xmath99 to map @xmath6 to some state @xmath100 for which now there _ does exist _ a corresponding hamiltonian @xmath91 with @xmath101 . if this is the case , we can , after having applied the map and by using the optimal protocol , extract an amount of work given by @xmath102 .",
    "as long as the heat lost during this process , given by @xmath103 , is smaller than the penalty term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxworkbound ] ) we will be able to extract more work using thermal maps from @xmath97 than by just using thermal contact . in the following ,",
    "we use the reasoning from above to show that there are natural scenarios and initial conditions where _ no _ work can be extracted using tc but work can be extracted using thermal operations .",
    "we will now illustrate this phenomena in two particularly relevant examples of physical restrictions .",
    "we first consider the scenario involving a bound on the operator - norm of the hamiltonian . to be concrete",
    ",    we conclude that if the set of allowed hamiltonians is restricted by a norm upper bound , to can extract a positive amount of work in some situations where tc can not .",
    "hence , thermal contact is not universal in this restricted scenario .",
    "here we show that it is possible to perform a transition as indicated in eq . .",
    "apart from its use in the previous section , we believe this result is interesting in its own right .",
    "let us note that the existence of the gp - map , which maps the initial state to @xmath104 , has a profound implication : it implies that a heat - bath at temperature @xmath105 can heat a colder system at a temperature @xmath106 to a temperature @xmath107 _ larger than @xmath105 _ while the total energy is conserved and the second law of thermodynamics , expressed in terms of free energies , is not violated .",
    "moreover , it turns out that @xmath107 can be made larger by _ reducing _ @xmath108 : the colder the system is initially , the hotter it is after the gp - map .",
    "motivated by this observation , we call this effect _ anomalous heat transfer_.",
    "so let us show that there exist indeed maps in @xmath109 , which display anomalous heat transfer .",
    "that is , map a state of a classical bit with excitation probability less than the thermal one to one with a higher excitation probability than the thermal one .",
    "first note , that for pairs @xmath51 which are diagonal in the same basis , the image of the set of gp - maps and to coincide @xcite .",
    "hence , it suffices to show the existence of a gp - map that performs the task above . for a classical bit , with hamiltonian @xmath110 ,",
    "the gibbs - distribution is given by @xmath111 a gp - map is simply given by a stochastic matrix which has @xmath112 as fixed point .",
    "all such matrices can be written as @xmath113 with @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath115 is an input distribution , than the output of the gp - map has excitation probability @xmath116 in particular for @xmath117 we obtain an excitation probability @xmath118 which can easily be larger than @xmath119 .",
    "the second scenario that we consider encodes the incapability to change interactions in multi - partite systems .",
    "we consider the scenario where multi - partite ( interacting ) hamiltonians can only be manipulated locally , @xmath120 with @xmath121 supported on subsystem labeled @xmath122 .",
    "we will now prove the existence of a gap between the optimal work extraction within protocols using thermal contact and protocols thermal operations . as a step towards this",
    "we first show the following result , which is interesting in its own right .",
