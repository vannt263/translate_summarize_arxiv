    "more than twenty years ago the invention of chirped - pulse - amplification ( cpa ) technique triggered a revolution in laser technology and lead to ultrashort laser pulses with huge peak powers @xcite .",
    "the novel laser sources allowed for a steady advance in a number of important scientific and industrial applications : high - field physics , `` attosecond '' physics and high - order harmonic generation , secondary compact sources of particles and radiation , inertial confinement fusion , probing and imaging of ultrafast processes for biology , medicine and material sciences , etc .",
    "the impressive progress has been demonstrated in plasma - based acceleration methods with ultrashort high - power laser pulses used as a driver generating accelerating plasma structures .",
    "quasimonoenergetic electron bunches with the energy up to @xmath5 gev have been generated in the pioneering experiments @xcite .",
    "now the @xmath5 gev energy barrier has been broken and electron bunches with a few percent energy spread and unprecedented sub - milliradian divergences have been recorded at @xmath6 gev energy @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the electrons have been accelerated in underdense plasmas in the so called bubble regime of laser wake fields @xcite .",
    "the traditional cpa lasers use tisa crystals and deliver an average power of a few watts only and a low efficiency .",
    "this is a significant drawback when we think about high energy physics applications where high luminosities are usually required .",
    "another laser technique based on fiber amplifiers pushes the laser average power up to kilowatt level and the laser wall - plug efficiency to over @xmath7 .",
    "these values are several orders of magnitude better than the traditional tisa lasers could possibly provide @xcite . the high peak power required by many applications",
    "can be achieved when the fiber laser systems are combined with cpa pulse compression and massive parallelism of multiple fiber amplifiers @xcite .",
    "the real revolution however is promised by the can ( coherent amplification network ) technology @xcite . here",
    ", the high average power and efficiency of the fiber laser systems is accomplished by the mutual coherence of individual laser pulses @xcite in the massively parallel fiber array .",
    "for the first time we are going to have a huge number of identical - and thus mutually coherent - laser pulses that can be flexibly arranged .",
    "it is expected that the laser - driven particle acceleration schemes will strongly benefit from the can project @xcite .",
    "the coherency allows to control not only the space - time distribution of the laser intensity in the acceleration region but also the phase distribution .",
    "this promises to make the acceleration much more robust and efficient .    at the same time , the continuous progress in micro- and nanotechnology stimulates exploration of dielectric - based laser - driven acceleration structures @xcite .",
    "such structures transform the transverse laser field into accelerating and focusing fields suitable for efficient particle acceleration .",
    "various accelerating schemes have been suggested : traveling wave structures @xcite , semi - open structures@xcite , resonant - closed structures @xcite , photon crystal structures @xcite , phase - modulation - mask structures @xcite etc .",
    "however , all these structures were designed for a single laser pulse driver as the traditional laser technology provides coherence for a single laser pulse only .    here",
    "we show that the can technology may become a real game changer in the structured acceleration .",
    "we propose several schemes that combine the advantage of multiple coherent laser pulses with advantages of resonant - closed and phase - modulation - mask structures .",
    "we concentrate here on single - shot regime when the solid elements of the structure are converted to plasma by the field ionization and evaporate after the interaction .",
    "yet we assume that the structure keeps its integrity during the short laser pulse duration .",
    "thus , we generate a regular overdense plasma structure .",
    "in contrast to the previous dielectric - based schemes @xcite we analyze robust schemes which do not rely on the laser phase shift in solid elements of the structure because this would be difficult to control in plasma .    the regular plasma structures allow for the first time to use the huge laser field itself and not a small perturbation generated by the laser in plasma .",
    "the sustained accelerating field can thus reach unprecedented values up to several tv / m .",
    "first we propose an accelerating structure based on a periodic set of fabry - perot resonators .",
    "the structure consists of two - dimensional resonator boxes on top of a solid substrate .",
    "the both sides of the cavities are equal to half a laser wavelength .",
    "the cross section of the structure geometry is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the cavities are covered by a thin foil ( the dashed area in fig .",
    "1 ) that is partially transparent for laser radiation while the other cavity walls reflect radiation .",
    "the microcavities ( the white quadratic areas in fig .",
    "1b ) may provide field enhancement up to the factor    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the field in the cavity , @xmath10is the laser field , @xmath11 is reflectivity of the covering foil .",
    "it has been demonstrated previously @xcite that intensity in the plasma cavity may reach a @xmath12-fold that of the pump lasers .",
    "the field amplification is important for laser pulses that are several periods long .",
    "the pulse energy gets trapped in the resonator and can be harvested by the witness beam load .",
    "the pulse duration @xmath13 and the optimal reflectivity of the semitransparent foil are connected as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the laser wavelength .    to achieve a phase synchronism",
    "between accelerated particles with the velocity @xmath16 and the field , the microcavities must be periodically intermitted along the beam axis with the period    @xmath17    thus , we introduce overdense plasma hills of @xmath18 width and @xmath15 period to screen the laser field in its decelerating phase ( the grey parts in fig 1 ) .",
    "the screening plasma hills should have a hole along the structure axis for particle beam transportation .",
    "the structure is irradiated from the @xmath19 direction by a laser polarized in the @xmath20 direction .",
    "the relativistic electron moves along the @xmath20 axis through the resonator cavity and through the screening elment within the hole of radius @xmath21 .",
    "an infinite extent in the @xmath22 dimension is assumed .",
    "the laser pulse must be short enough and the laser intensity must be moderate so that the structure keeps its integrity during the interaction .",
    "our pic simulations using the code vlpl ( virtual laser plasma lab ) @xcite show that the plasma resonator structures may survive intensities up to about @xmath23 , corresponding to accelerating fields above @xmath24 .",
    "the principle of the proposed accelerating structure is rather simple : enhancement of the accelerating fields and damping of the decelerating fields .",
    "the relativistic electron with a proper phase harvests the accelerating field in the cavity during the half laser period .",
    "when the laser field changes its sign and becomes decelerating , electrons are screened from the field under the overdense plasma hill .",
    "relativistic electrons passing through the structure at a proper phase gain energy .    in our pic simulations",
    ", we took a laser pulse with a gaussian temporal profile @xmath25 with the relativistic amplitude @xmath26 and duration @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath15=800 nm is the laser wavelength , @xmath28 is the laser field amplitude , @xmath29 is the laser frequency , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron mass , the electron charge and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the plasma electron density was assumed to be @xmath33  @xmath34 , the thickness of the semitransparent foil was @xmath35 . the longitudinal electric field distribution calculated in the cavity and in the damping part",
    "is shown in fig.[fig2 - 1]a .",
    "it is seen from fig.[fig2 - 1]a that the electric field is amplified by a factor about @xmath36 in the cavity due to the fabry - perot effect while it is supressed in the damping part nearly completely .     with the normalized magnitude @xmath37 ; ( b ) @xmath38 with the normalized magnitude @xmath39 and ( c ) @xmath40 with the normalized magnitude @xmath41 .",
    "the fields are shown inside the cavity and in the damping part of the structure at the phase when the accelerating field @xmath42 reaches its maximum . ]",
    "we study the dynamics of relativistic electrons in the electromagnetic field obtained from pic simulations .",
    "the test electrons are assumed to be injected near the cavity axis which passes through the cavity centers .",
    "first we estimate the gain in the momentum of the electron passing a one - period structure as a function of the initial field phase @xmath43 and @xmath44-coordinate of the electron    @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the laser period .",
    "the gain in the momentum of the electron travelling in the fields retrieved from pic simulation as function of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "electron acceleration is efficient when the gain in the longitudinal momentum peaks and the transverse momentum exhibits stable betatron oscillations .",
    "it follows from fig.[fig3]a that the optimal regime of acceleration corresponds to @xmath47 . in the ideal accelerator ,",
    "the bunch axis must coincide with the middle of the microcavity where the transverse fields are zero .",
    "numerical simulations show that the transverse force is not exactly absent at the cavity symmetry axis due to higher mode excitation and nonlinear interactions with plasma . as a result the electron undergoes some betatron oscillations even if it starts to move along the cavity symmetry axis .     of an electron passing through the one - period structure as function of the initial field phase @xmath43 ;",
    "b ) trajectories of electrons injected at the center of the cavity starting with @xmath48 , and evenly distributed phases in the field phase @xmath43 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . ]    using periodic boundary condition for the field distribution shown in figure [ fig2 - 1 ] we analyze electron acceleration in a many - period accelerating structure .",
    "the typical electron trajectories are shown in figure [ fig3]b .",
    "it follows from the analysis that the stable and efficient regime of electron acceleration corresponds to @xmath47 that agrees with the estimates presented above .",
    "long - term acceleration is demonstrated in fig.[fig4 ] . the electron gains energy of about @xmath51gev over @xmath6 meters of the structure .",
    "the transverse betatron amplitude of the accelerated electron remains less than @xmath52 during acceleration .    , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . ]",
    "the resonator microcavities have the advantage that they can trap the laser pulse energy and amplify the field .",
    "however , it might be difficult to achieve high finesses , and the resonating properties are very sensitive to the plasma parameters , sizes of the microboxes and the wall quality .",
    "in addition , the very thin semi - transparent foil covering the microcavity can only survive very short pulses of moderate intensity .",
    "thus , non - resonating open structures have their advantages .    again , to satisfy a phase synchronism between a normally incident laser pulse and an electron propagating in the transverse direction ,",
    "the plasma structure must have a spatial period defined by the relation .",
    "thus , for a relativistic electron , we need a structure with the period equal to the laser wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "one may think of different configurations .",
    "the simplest one is shown in fig.[fig5]a . in this simulation",
    "we assume two counterpropagating phased laser echelons interacting with a periodic plasma grid .",
    "the overdense plasma regions have the length of @xmath18 and are separated by vacuum regions of the same length @xmath18 .",
    "the accelerating field configuration is shown in fig.[fig5]b .",
    "we assumed that the lasers of the both echelons have the peak relativistic amplitude of @xmath55 so that the combined accelerating field in the center of the structure reaches the peak amplitude @xmath56 .        in our simulations",
    ", we injected a continuous beam of test electrons with initial @xmath48 into the structure .",
    "about a quarter of the electrons has been trapped and accelerated up to @xmath3 energy after a propagation distance of only @xmath4 , see fig.[fig5]c .",
    "this corresponds to a sustained acceleration rate of @xmath57 .",
    "the configuration space of the electron bunch is shown in fig.[fig5]d .",
    "electrons with the highest energy are also tightly focused and the coma of the bunch has an r.m.s .",
    "radius of about @xmath58 .",
    "the advantage of the open structure with laser echelons coming from both sides is its robustness with respect to an exact position of the plasma grid .",
    "the fields are defined by the laser relative phases only .",
    "this makes the scheme unsensitive to e.g. , mechanical jitter of the grid .",
    "we mention also another importat feature .",
    "the plasma plasma structure remains invisible by the counterporpagating laser pulses .",
    "no modes modes propagating along the plasma grid are generated and we see essentially no perturbations in the laser field distribution in vacuum .",
    "this promises a high quality acceleration with potentially high energy conversion efficiency .        yet",
    ", a very similar field distribution can be created with a single echelon of laser pulses if we use a grid on a surface of a solid substrate , see fig.[fig6]a .",
    "the accelerating field inside the cavities , fig.[fig6]b , has a very similar structure as in fig.[fig5]b . in this particular simulation",
    "we used a lower laser pulse amplitude of of @xmath59 so that the combined accelerating field of the incident and reflected wave in the center of the cavity reaches the peak amplitude @xmath60 .",
    "because of the lower amplitude , the plasma response is more linear and less noise due to excitation of nonlinear harmonics and higher modes is seen in this picture .",
    "however , the exact position of the field maximum in this scheme is defined no more by the laser phase , but rather by the position of the reflecting surface of the substrate and thus is fully sensitive to mechanical oscillations of the structure .",
    "we have considered a possibility to use an echelon of laser pulses generated by the emerging can technology for direct particle acceleration in periodic plasma structures .",
    "the advantage of the method is the potentially extremely high acceleration rate above @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is that the laser field itself is used and not a perturbative plasma field ( e.g. wake field ) . in our simulations , we show that a sustained acceleration rate of @xmath57 is feasible with the plasma structures .",
    "we discussed resonant and free streaming configurations .",
    "the resonant plasma structures can trap energy of longer laser pulses that would be harvested by the witness bunch .",
    "however , the resonant structure is limited to moderate laser intensities of about @xmath0 as the thin semi - transparent plasma foil is destroyed very fast .",
    "the free streaming configurations can survive laser intensities above @xmath1 for several tens of femtoseconds .",
    "the plasma structures survive a single shot only . however , due to their simplicity and projected very low production costs , the structures can be replaced for every laser shot at a kiloherz repetition rate .",
