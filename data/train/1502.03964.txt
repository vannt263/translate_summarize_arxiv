    "are realized by a set of atomic states , which includes one or potentially more rydberg levels .",
    "one requirement of these schemes is the ability to measure the rydberg states population in order to read out the results of the quantum operations . for accomplishing this task ,",
    "most experiments with ultracold rydberg gases use methods including field ionization and subsequent detection of electrons and/or ions on multi - channel plates or channeltrons  @xcite .",
    "these techniques offer high sensitivity and  for carefully chosen experimental conditions  @xcite  selectivity among the rydberg levels  @xcite .",
    "selective field ionization ( sfi ) techniques are based on the fact that the ionization threshold is different for each atomic state , increasing from higher to lower lying levels . hence , by slowly ramping up the electric field and monitoring the electrons / ions over time it is possible to deduce the initial populations in each level .",
    "however , the population of a lower lying rydberg level can not be probed without destroying the population of any higher lying rydberg state .",
    "therefore this method is not applicable in protocols which require independent probing of multiple rydberg states@xcite .",
    "another inherent property of methods based on ionization is that the detected atoms are removed from the system and can not be reused .",
    "although this atomic loss is negligible in most cases @xcite , it might be a serious limitation in experiments working with only one or a few atoms @xcite .",
    "one alternative to ionization detection methods is all - optical probing based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied in order to non - destructively probe the rydberg level structure in non - interacting  @xcite and weakly interacting  @xcite rydberg gases , as well as in the presence of electric fields  @xcite .",
    "these experiments , however , did not access the population of the rydberg state .",
    "on the other hand , an eit - based scheme for the optical detection of rydberg population  @xcite has been proposed and demonstrated in dense atomic clouds where the rydberg blockade allows the spatially resolved detection of rydberg atoms .    here",
    "we propose an all - optical scheme for detecting the population in a selected rydberg state in dilute gases . by using a series of laser pulses in eit configuration this technique also allows for distinction between coherent superpositions and statistical mixtures of the ground and rydberg states of the atoms .",
    "since this scheme is based on time - resolved observation of the optical response of individual atoms it may , in principle , be used down to the single atom level .",
    "our method is state selective and applicable for testing the population not only in the highest rydberg level of interest ( cf .",
    "sfi ) but any lower lying or intermediate rydberg state .",
