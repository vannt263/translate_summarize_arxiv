    "we ensure that the momenta of the lepton and meson candidates are kinematically compatible with a real signal decay by requiring that a geometrical vertex fit of the tracks of the two particles gives a @xmath61 probability greater than 1% and that their angles in the laboratory frame be between 0.41 and 2.46 rad with respect to the @xmath62-beam direction , the acceptance of the detector .",

    "furthermore , the momenta of the lepton and the meson are restricted to enhance signal over background .",
    "we require the following : for  decays , @xmath66  or @xmath67  or @xmath68 ; for   decays , @xmath69  or @xmath70   or @xmath71 ; and for   decays , @xmath72  or @xmath73  or @xmath74   ( all asterisked variables are in the center - of - mass frame ) . for the  decays , we restrict the reconstructed masses of the @xmath31 and @xmath28 to lie in the intervals @xmath75  and @xmath76 . for these decays , we also reject events with  higher than 16 @xmath18 , since the signal is dominated by background in that range .",
    "most backgrounds are reduced by -dependent selections on the angle ( @xmath77 ) between the thrust axes of the @xmath49 and of the rest of the event , on the polar angle ( @xmath78 ) associated with @xmath79 , on the invariant missing mass squared ( @xmath80 ) divided by twice the missing energy ( @xmath81 ) , and on the angle ( @xmath82 ) between the direction of the @xmath83 boson ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 combined ) in the rest frame of the @xmath5 meson and the direction of the lepton in the rest frame of the @xmath83 boson .",
