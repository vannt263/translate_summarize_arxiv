    "it is now widely accepted that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) within a mass range of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 g is the solar mass ) form at the centres of spiral and elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1969 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ; kormendy 2004 ) .",
    "observationally , smbh masses @xmath0 correlate with various properties of spiral galaxy bulges or elliptical galaxies , including bulge luminosities ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) , stellar bulge masses @xmath10 ( e.g. , magorrian et al . 1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; h@xmath11ring & rix 2004 ) , @xmath0 versus @xmath10 relations in active ( agn ) and inactive galaxies ( e.g. , wandel 1999 , 2002 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ) , galaxy light concentrations ( e.g. , graham et al . 2001 ) , the s@xmath12rsic index ( s@xmath12rsic 1968 ) of surface brightness profile ( e.g. , graham & driver 2007 ) , inner core radii ( e.g. , lauer et al . 2007 ) , spiral arm pitch angles ( e.g. , seigar et al .",
    "2008 ) , bulge gravitational binding energies ( e.g. , aller & richstone 2007 ) and mean stellar velocity dispersions @xmath3 ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; ferrarese & ford 2005 ; hu 2008 ) .",
    "these empirical correlations strongly suggest a physical link between smbhs and their host bulges ( e.g. , springel , matteo & hernquist 2005 ; li , haiman & maclow 2007 ) .    among these empirical relations , @xmath0 and @xmath3",
    "correlate tightly in a power law with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath13 dex ( e.g. , novak et al .",
    "this relation was explored theoretically ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; blandford 1999 ) before observations ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) and the emphasis was on outflow effects for galaxies .",
    "the idea was further elaborated by king ( 2003 ) . a model of singular isothermal sphere with rotation ( adams , graff & richstone 2001 )",
    "was proposed for the @xmath14 relation .",
    "this relation was also studied in a semi - analytic model ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) with starbursts while smbhs being formed and fueled during major mergers .",
    "accretion of collisional dark matter onto smbhs may also give the @xmath4 relation ( e.g. , ostriker 2000 ; see haehnelt 2004 for a review ) .",
    "there are also numerical simulations to model feedbacks from smbhs and stars on host galaxies .",
    "observationally , there are two empirical types of bulges : classical bulges ( spiral galaxies with classical bulges or elliptical galaxies ) and pseudobulges ( e.g. , kormendy et al .",
    "2004 ; drory & fisher 2007 ) .",
    "while smbhs in classical bulges are formed after major mergers , pseudobulges do not show obvious merger signatures .",
    "interestingly , pseudobulges also manifest a @xmath4 power law yet with a different exponent ( e.g. , kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; hu 2008 ) .",
    "self - similar dynamics of a conventional polytropic gas sphere has been studied earlier ( e.g. , yahil 1983 ; suto & silk 1988 ; lou & wang 2006 ( lw06 ) and references therein ) .",
    "lw06 obtained novel self - similar quasi - static dynamic solutions which approach singular polytropic spheres ( sps ) after a long time .",
    "such polytropic dynamic solutions have been further generalized and applied to study protostar formation ,  champagne flows \" in h ii regions , stellar core collapse , rebound shocks and the formation of compact stellar objects in a single fluid model ( lw06 ; lou & wang 2007 ; wang & lou 2007 , 2008 ; hu & lou 2008 ) as well as galaxy clusters in a two - fluid model ( lou , jiang & jin 2008 ; ljj hereafter ) .",
    "here , we take such quasi - static solutions in a general polytropic fluid to describe long - time evolution of host stellar bulges and the formation of central smbhs and to establish @xmath4 power laws .",
    "for the dynamic evolution of a stellar bulge in a galaxy , we adopt a few simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we treat the stellar bulge as a spherical polytropic fluid as the typical age @xmath15 yr of galactic bulges is long ( e.g. , frogel 1998 ; gnedin , norman & ostriker 1999 ) that they are continuously adjusted and relaxed .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions produce an effective pressure @xmath16 against the self - gravity as in the jeans equation ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "secondly , the total mass of the interstellar medium in a galaxy is @xmath17 ( e.g. , gnedin et al .",
    "1999 ) , only @xmath18 of the total bulge mass .",
    "although gas densities in broad and narrow line regions of agns are high , the filling factor is usually small ( @xmath19 ; osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) and the gas breaks into clumpy clouds .",
    "thus gas is merged into our stellar fluid as an approximation .",
    "thirdly , the diameter of broad line regions of agns is only @xmath20 pc ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) and the disc around a smbh is even smaller while a galactic bulge size is @xmath21 kpc .",
    "we thus ignore small - scale structures around the central smbh of a spherical bulge . finally , as rotation curves of galaxies show ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) , the effect of dark matter halo in the innermost region ( around several kpcs ) of a galaxy may be neglected .",
    "so the dark matter is not included as we study the bulge dynamics .",
    "hydrodynamic equations of a general polytropic bulge model with spherical symmetry are mass conservation @xmath22 or equivalently @xmath23 radial momentum conservation ( lw06 ; wang & lou 2008 ) @xmath24 and ` specific entropy ' conservation along streamlines ( ljj ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is radius and @xmath27 is time ; @xmath28 is the enclosed mass and @xmath29 is the bulk radial flow speed ; @xmath30 is the effective pressure and @xmath31 is the mass density ; @xmath32 is the polytropic index for the stellar bulge fluid ; @xmath33 is the gravity constant .    as the bulk flow of stellar fluid is slow ,",
    "we invoke the novel self - similar quasi - static solutions ( lw06 ; ljj ) to model the bulge evolution under spherical symmetry .",
    "we use a self - similar transformation ( lw06 ; ljj ) to solve the general polytropic fluid equations @xmath34 , namely @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the independent dimensionless similarity variable while @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two scaling indices ; is not the s@xmath12rsic index of surface brightness profile . ]",
    "@xmath39 is the reduced mass density and @xmath40 is the reduced radial flow speed ; @xmath41 is the reduced pressure and @xmath42 is the reduced enclosed mass ; reduced variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 are functions of @xmath36 only .",
    "we require @xmath45 for a positive mass . by transformation ( [ transformation ] ) , we readily construct self - similar quasi - static dynamic solutions from the general polytropic fluid equations @xmath34 that approach the sps as the leading term for small @xmath36 .",
    "properties of such asymptotic solutions to the leading order ( lw06 ; wang & lou 2008 ; ljj ) are summarized below . both initial ( @xmath46 ) and final ( @xmath47 )",
    "mass density profiles scale as @xmath48 ; accordingly , the bulge enclosed mass profile is @xmath49 . as @xmath50 or @xmath47 , the density and enclosed mass profiles are @xmath51 where @xmath52\\}^{1/(q+\\gamma-2)}$ ] and @xmath53 .",
    "for either @xmath54 or @xmath55 , the reduced velocity @xmath56 , which means at a time @xmath27 , for either @xmath57 or @xmath58 the flow speed @xmath59 , or at a radius @xmath26 , when @xmath27 is short or long enough , the radial flow speed @xmath59 .",
    "our model describes a self - similar bulge evolution towards a nearly static configuration after a long time lapse , appropriate for galactic bulges at the present epoch .    as the effective pressure @xmath16 results from stellar bulge velocity dispersion",
    ", we readily derive the mean velocity dispersion @xmath3 in a bulge . by specific entropy conservation along streamlines",
    ", we relate @xmath16 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( ljj ) and derive the @xmath16 profile from our quasi - static solutions .",
    "we then take the local stellar velocity dispersion as @xmath62 . the asymptotic expression",
    "when @xmath47 for the local stellar velocity dispersion in our model is therefore @xmath63 to compare with observations , we derive the spatially averaged stellar velocity dispersion @xmath3 within the bulge .",
    "the bulge boundary is taken as the radius @xmath64 where @xmath60 drops to a value @xmath65 indistinguishable from the environment .",
    "practically , the mean velocity dispersion @xmath3 is usually estimated within the half - light radius which is less than the outer bulge photometric radius . as @xmath66 decreases with increasing @xmath26 by equation ( [ sigmal ] ) , the mean @xmath3 would be higher within the half - light radius . in principle , the environmental density for different bulges is not the same and it is difficult to give the density exactly .",
    "here , we take a reasonable critical density @xmath65 as the criterion to define the boundary of a bulge , which means when the density of a bulge drops to the critical density @xmath65 , we define the domain within this radius @xmath67 as the bulge . for a class of bulges with the same @xmath38",
    ", @xmath65 is regarded as a constant .",
    "so the difference in @xmath65 reflects different environments of bulges with different parameter @xmath38 .",
    "one can readily show that within @xmath67 @xmath68(4\\pi g\\rho_c)^{(1-n)/2}a^{3nq/4}k^{1/2}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & { \\cal q}k^{1/2}\\ .\\label{sigma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     with @xmath69 ( solid curve ) .",
    "meanwhile , we draw a straight dashed line @xmath70 with @xmath71 for the mass of the central smbh versus the schwarzschild radius @xmath26 . here at @xmath72 km , the straight line intersects the enclosed mass power - law curve for a @xmath73 smbh .",
    "the region within @xmath74 km is the smbh in this example .",
    "a self - similar general polytropic quasi - static solution of @xmath75 can thus form a smbh at the stellar bulge centre by this criterion.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] +    this relation is particularly satisfying on the intuitive ground .",
    "a smbh forms at the centre of a galactic bulge that evolves in a self - similar quasi - static manner .",
    "such a smbh was formed by the core collapse of collections of stars and gas towards the bulge centre and grows rapidly by matter accretion at an earlier phase ( e.g. , lynden - bell 1969 ; hu et al .",
    "2006 ; see haehnelt 2004 and references therein for a review of the joint formation of smbhs and galaxies ) . as the growth timescale for smbhs",
    "is only @xmath76 yr , our quasi - static solutions describe the relatively quiescent phase of galactic bulges after the formation of smbhs as a longer history of a bulge evolution .",
    "the stellar fluid made up of stars and condensed gas clouds has a slow bulk flow speed towards the central smbh , sustaining a reservoir of mass accretion for the circumnuclear torus and/or disc on smaller scales .",
    "besides , there have been observational evidences to show that stars torn up by the tidal force of the smbh may account for the observed x - rays at the centre of bulges ( e.g. , zhao , haehnelt & rees 2002 ; komossa 2004 ; komossa et al .",
    "2004 ; komossa et al .",
    "2008 ) , which presents a scenario of how our stellar fluid being accreted by a central smbh .",
    "we now introduce the criterion of forming a smbh in a spherical stellar bulge .",
    "a smbh mass @xmath0 and its schwarzschild radius @xmath77 are related by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the speed of light and @xmath80 is an adjustable factor of order unity . according to equation ( [ masanddensity ] ) ,",
    "the mass enclosed within the radius @xmath26 is @xmath81 . at a certain radius @xmath82^{n/(2n-2)}$ ] where it happens with @xmath83 to form central smbhs , and this would not alter our results significantly . ]",
    "@xmath84 , a smbh forms .",
    "only those quasi - static bulges with @xmath75 can form central smbhs as shown in figure [ mass ] ; we derive @xmath85[(3n-2)f c^2/(2na)]^{n/(2n-2)}k^{1/(2 - 2n)}$ ] and the power law below @xmath86 where the coefficient @xmath87 depends on @xmath88 , @xmath33 , @xmath38 , @xmath32 , @xmath65 , and the exponent @xmath89 because of the requirement @xmath6 .",
    "other researchers have their own criteria , which differ from ours , to define the black holes in their models to give a @xmath4 relation ( e.g. , adams et al .",
    "while the @xmath4 power law is very tight with intrinsic scatter @xmath90 dex for smbhs and host bulges ( e.g. , novak & faber 2006 ) , such scatter is large enough to accommodate different exponents in the @xmath4 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) . by relation ( [ relation ] ) , we have a natural interpretation for intrinsic scatters in the observed @xmath91 power law . in our model ,",
    "all bulges with the same @xmath38 lie on a straight line with the exponent @xmath92 as shown in figure [ msigmarelation ] . for a fixed @xmath38 ,",
    "different bulges are represented by different @xmath37 values in transformation ( [ transformation ] ) , leading to different @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , for bulges with different @xmath38 values , they lie on different lines . for elliptical galaxies or bulges in spiral galaxies ,",
    "they appear to eventually take the self - similar evolution described above with a certain @xmath38 value . but pseudobulges may take on different @xmath38 values .",
    "observationally , we can not determine a priori the specific @xmath38 value for a bulge but simply attempt to fit all bulges with a single exponent , which then leads in part to intrinsic scatter in the observed @xmath14 power law .    to show this",
    ", we fit three published @xmath4 power laws in figure [ msigmarelation ] .",
    "the first one is @xmath93 given in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with our parameters @xmath94 being @xmath95 ; and the five points ( asterisks @xmath96 ) correspond to @xmath97 cgs unit and @xmath98 kpc .",
    "the second one is @xmath99 given in tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with our parameters @xmath94 being @xmath100 , 1.330 , @xmath101 ; and the seven points ( plus signs @xmath102 ) correspond to @xmath103 cgs unit and @xmath104 kpc .",
    "the third one is @xmath105 given in hu ( 2008 ) with our parameters @xmath94 being @xmath106 , @xmath107 ; and the six points ( solid dots ) correspond to @xmath108 cgs unit and @xmath109 kpc .",
    "clearly , to fit all these points in figure [ msigmarelation ] with a single power law , we would get a different result with higher intrinsic scatter .",
    "in fact , there is yet another @xmath4 relation given in ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) , namely @xmath110 ( also ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "if we were to fit this relation according to our model ( e.g. , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 mpc ) , the critical mass density @xmath65 would be too small and the bulge size for a certain average velocity dispersion would be too large .",
    "so it seems that our model favours multiple power laws contained in the available data . in the three more sensible fitting examples above ,",
    "bulge inflow speeds of stellar fluid are slow ( @xmath114 km s@xmath115 ) , an evolution feature of our self - similar quasi - static solutions . near the smbh boundary @xmath77 , the inflow rest mass - energy flux falls in the range of @xmath116 in these examples , sufficient to supply the observed x - ray luminosities ( komossa et al .",
    "there can be outgoing accretion shocks around a smbh in these inflows .",
    "as the age of galactic bulges is so long ( @xmath117 yr ) ( frogel 1998 ) that such shocks should have already gone outside bulges and dispersed or merged into surroundings .",
    "relations in our general polytropic model for quasi - static self - similar bulge evolution and the formation of a central smbh .",
    "three indices @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 are adopted for three different classes , namely , solid line ( hu 2008 ) , dashed line ( tremaine et al . 2002 ) , dotted line ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) , of @xmath4 power law ( [ relation ] ) . given @xmath38",
    ", we calculate the smbh mass @xmath0 and the mean stellar velocity dispersion @xmath3 for a certain @xmath37 value in self - similar transformation ( [ transformation ] ) .",
    "a bulge has different mean velocity dispersion @xmath3 for different @xmath37 values .",
    "each bulge - smbh system is represented by a point in this plot .",
    "all such systems of same @xmath38 lie on a straight line , while systems of different @xmath38 values correspond to different lines in our model.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] +    besides the @xmath4 relation , observations reveal @xmath121 with @xmath10 being the stellar bulge mass ( e.g. , h@xmath122ring & rix 2004 and references therein ) and @xmath123 with @xmath124 being the absolute value of the bulge gravitational binding energy ( e.g. , aller & richstone 2007 ) . using our criterion of forming a smbh and the bulge radius @xmath67",
    ", we derive a power law between @xmath0 and @xmath10 as @xmath125 according to equation ( [ masanddensity ] ) . for @xmath126",
    ", our result leads to relations in adams et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but for a nonisothermal general sps .",
    "the bulge gravitational binding energy , without contributions from dark matter halo and a disc as in aller & richstone ( 2007 ) , is @xmath127 . for self - similar quasi - static dynamic solutions in general polytropic fluid model ,",
    "we obtain @xmath128 .    as another class of bulges ,",
    "pseudobulges are thought to have formed without merging in contrast to classical bulges .",
    "pseudobulges again follow a @xmath4 power law ( hu 2008 ) , i.e. , @xmath129 .",
    "pseudobulges may take a different self - similar quasi - static evolution for a different @xmath38 . for their different formation history ,",
    "they show a different @xmath4 power law as observed . for @xmath130 being @xmath131 , we can fit the empirical power law for pseudobulges ; e.g. , with @xmath132 cgs unit , we have @xmath133 and @xmath134 kpc for elliptical galaxies .",
    "on the basis of a self - similar quasi - static dynamic evolution of a general polytropic sphere ( lw06 , ljj ) , we establish @xmath135 with @xmath6 by equation ( [ relation ] ) . our first conclusion is @xmath89 which appears consistent with observations so far .",
    "secondly , uncertainties in the formation criterion of a smbh [ i.e. , factor @xmath80 in @xmath136 and in the choice of @xmath67 and thus @xmath65 will not change the form of equation ( [ relation ] ) and the @xmath38 value but will only affect the value of @xmath7 .",
    "thirdly , the tight @xmath14 power laws and other relations among the smbh mass @xmath0 and known properties of host stellar bulges strongly suggest coeval growths of smbhs and galactic bulges ( e.g. , page et al .",
    "2001 ; haehnelt 2004 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; hu et al .",
    "fourthly in our model , while forming a smbh at the bulge centre ( e.g. , by core collapse of gas and stars or by merging ) , the spherical general polytropic bulge evolves in a self - similar quasi - static phase for a long time .",
    "we then reproduce well - established empirical @xmath4 power laws .",
    "different energetic processes appear to give rise to different scaling index @xmath38 values , which finally determines the slope of the @xmath4 relations in a logarithmic presentation .    besides classical bulges and pseudobulges , there are also ` core ' elliptical galaxies ( i.e. , those with apparent ` cores ' of relatively flat brightness ; lauer et al . 1995 ; hu 2008 ) , thought to have formed by ` dry ' mergers ( i.e. , almost without gas ) .",
    "a steeper @xmath14 relation exists in these galaxies as compared to that for classical bulges ( e.g. , lauer et al .",
    "1995 ; laine et al . 2003 ; lauer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this can also be accommodated in our unified scenario that all hosts of smbhs may finally evolve into self - similar quasi - static phase with different scaling parameters ( i.e. , different index @xmath38 for the slope and different @xmath65 for the normalization of the @xmath14 relation ) . while these bulges can be of quite different kinds in galaxies ,",
    "they have these similar tight relations and we thus provide a unified self - similar dynamic framework to model the relatively quiescent evolution phase of smbh host bulges and the growth of smbh masses . as the observed @xmath4 relation for classical bulges is tight ,",
    "the elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxies appear to take on close @xmath38 values for merging processes .    in our model , @xmath38 is a key scaling index to determine the exponent of the @xmath4 power law .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath38 is , the steeper the density profile is and the smaller the index of the @xmath4 relation is .",
    "if smbhs are formed by collapse of stars and gas and a less steeper density distribution may provide a more effective mechanism to form smbhs , then we conclude that for a certain value of velocity dispersions , is not sensitive to @xmath38 . ]",
    "the smaller the mass of an initially formed smbh is , the smaller the value of @xmath38 is . after a long lapse ,",
    "our quasi - static solutions approach the static sps solution as the leading term that is independent of the timescale .",
    "so all the described relations here are nearly independent of time , as long as the systems have evolved for a long enough time .",
    "it is not obvious to decide when the host bulges began to take the described self - similar evolution .",
    "but even if we take different times in our model , our results would remain largely the same .",
    "the only difference is that for an early time , we may have a chance to observe accretion shocks within the region of stellar bulges .",
    "such shocks are characterized by a rapid inner density rise of several times and a rapid inner rise of stellar velocity dispersions depending on the strength of accretion shocks .",

    "<S> growing evidence indicate supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in a mass range of @xmath0@xmath1 lurking in central stellar bulges of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> extensive observations reveal fairly tight power laws of @xmath2 versus the mean stellar velocity dispersion @xmath3 of the host stellar bulge . </S>",
    "<S> together with evidence for correlations between @xmath0 and other properties of host bulges , the dynamic evolution of a bulge and the formation of a central smbh should be linked . in this letter , we reproduce the empirical @xmath4 power laws based on our recent theoretical analyses ( lou & wang ; wang & lou ; lou , jiang & jin ) for a self - similar general polytropic quasi - static dynamic evolution of bulges with self - gravity and spherical symmetry and present a sensible criterion of forming a central smbh . the key result is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a proportional coefficient characteristic of different classes of host bulges . by fitting and comparing several empirical @xmath4 power laws , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that smbhs and galactic bulges grow and evolve in a coeval manner and most likely there exist several classes of galactic bulge systems in quasi - static self - similar evolution and that to mix them together can lead to an unrealistic fitting . based on our bulge - smbh model , </S>",
    "<S> we provide explanations for intrinsic scatter in the relation and a unified scenario for the formation and evolution of smbhs in different classes of host bulges .    black hole physics  galaxies : bulges  galaxies : evolution  galaxies : nuclei  hydrodynamics  quasars : general </S>"
