    "the lifetimes of b hadrons depend both on the strength of the b quark coupling to the lighter c and u quarks , and on the dynamics of b hadron decay .",
    "the spectator model prediction that the lifetimes of all heavy hadrons containing the same heavy quark are equal is modified by non - spectator effects dependent on the flavour of the light quark(s ) in the hadron .",
    "in contrast to the charm hadrons , where @xmath63 @xcite , non - spectator processes are expected to lead to lifetime differences between the  and  mesons of at most 10% @xcite .",
    "measurements of b hadron lifetimes at the level of a few percent or better are therefore needed to test these predictions , and probe the non - spectator processes contributing to the decays .",
    "in addition , precise measurements of the  lifetime are also needed for the determination of the magnitude of the ckm matrix element  @xcite .",
    "the most precise measurements of the  lifetime come from topological vertex reconstruction techniques , where the selection of charged secondary vertices allows a clean sample of  decays to be isolated @xcite .",

    "the data sample used in this analysis consists of about 4 million hadronic  decays collected during the period 19911995 , together with an additional 400000 events recorded primarily for detector calibration purposes in 19962000 .",
    "corresponding simulated event samples were generated using jetset 7.4 @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "hadronic  decays were selected using standard criteria @xcite . to ensure the event was well contained within the acceptance of the detector , the thrust axis direction along the electron beam direction and @xmath68 pointing to the centre of the lep ring .",

    "the transverse momentum @xmath72 of each track was defined relative to the axis of the jet containing it , where the jet axis was calculated including the momentum of the track .",
    "the reconstruction of  events was performed by combining high @xmath73 and @xmath72 lepton ( electron or muon ) candidates with oppositely charged pions from the @xmath0 decay . the selection is similar to that used in @xcite , but with some changes to produce an unbiased  decay proper time measurement and to increase the efficiency at the expense of higher combinatorial background .",
    "electrons were identified and photon conversions rejected using neural network algorithms @xcite , and muons were identified as in @xcite . both electrons and muons were required to have momenta @xmath74 , transverse momenta with respect to the jet axis @xmath75 , and to lie in the polar angle region @xmath76 .",
    "the selection of pions from  decays relies on the small mass difference of only 145mev @xcite between the  and , which means the pions have very little transverse momentum with respect to the  direction . in each jet containing a lepton candidate ,",
    "the  momentum vector  and energy @xmath77 were reconstructed using an inclusive technique , selecting a group of tracks and calorimeter clusters compatible with a  decay using kinematic , impact parameter and invariant mass information .",

    "each track in the jet ( other than the lepton ) was then considered in turn as a slow pion candidate , provided it satisfied @xmath78gev and had a transverse momentum with respect to the  direction of less than 0.3gev . if the pion under consideration had been included in the reconstructed , it was removed and the  momentum and energy recalculated . the final selection was made using the reconstructed mass difference in @xcite . ]  between the  and  mesons , calculated as @xmath79 where the  energy is given by @xmath80 and momentum by @xmath81 .",
    "the position of the  candidate decay vertex was reconstructed from the intersection point of the lepton and slow pion tracks in the @xmath68-@xmath82 plane .",

    "this was converted to a three dimensional decay distance @xmath84 using the jet polar angle . using just the lepton and pion tracks , together with the interaction point position and uncertainty determined with a fit to many consecutive events @xcite , results in a decay length estimate which is bias free and whose resolution does not depend strongly on the decay length itself .",
    "although the decay length resolution could be improved by adding more tracks to the  decay vertex , this would introduce significant bias at small decay lengths , and is not necessary as the resolution is already adequate for the measurement of  and .",
    "the reconstructed decay length @xmath84 was signed positive if the  decay vertex was displaced from the beamspot in the direction of the jet momentum , and negative otherwise .",
    "the decay length error @xmath85 was calculated from the track parameter and beamspot position error matrices .",

    "carlo simulation , about 36% of opposite sign events with @xmath89 are signal  events , 15% are resonant background and 49% are combinatorial background .",

    "the proper decay time @xmath66 of each  candidate was calculated from its reconstructed decay length @xmath84 and energy .",
    "the energy was calculated using a technique similar to that described in @xcite , exploiting overall energy and momentum conservation in the event to account for the missing energy of the unreconstructed neutrino .",
    "the event was treated as a two - body decay of a  into a  of mass 5.279gev @xcite and another object making up the rest of the event .",
    "the  energy was calculated as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the centre - of - mass energy of the event and @xmath103 the invariant mass of the object recoiling against the .",
    "the latter was calculated from all tracks and calorimeter clusters in the event , excluding the lepton and those associated to the reconstructed . a correction for double counting of charged particles in the tracking detectors and calorimeters",
    "was applied @xcite , and the recoil mass was first scaled by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the total event visible energy and @xmath106 is the typical visible energy in events with only one neutrino .",

    "the resulting energy estimate is unbiased and has an rms resolution of 3.8gev in monte carlo  events , as shown in figure  [ f : resfn](a ) .",
    "the proper decay time @xmath66 was then calculated from the candidate decay length and energy as @xmath107 the resulting proper time resolution depends on the true proper time @xmath108 , but has no significant bias , as shown in figure  [ f : resfn](b  f ) .",
    "the resolution degrades with increasing proper time due to the larger influence of the energy resolution at large decay lengths .",
    "the resolution was parameterised as a function @xmath109 giving the expected distribution of reconstructed @xmath66 for each true value @xmath108 .",
    "the resolution function was implemented as the sum of three gaussian distributions , whose widths vary linearly with @xmath108 .",

    "this bias was corrected in the corresponding resolution functions .",
    "the  oscillation frequency measurement requires that the production and decay flavour (  or ) of each meson be determined , in addition to the decay proper time @xmath66 .",
    "the decay flavour can be determined from the sign of the lepton in the  decay , but the production flavour must be determined from other information in the event .",
    "the production of quark anti - quark pairs in @xmath114 decays allows the production flavour of the  to be inferred from that of the other b hadron in the event .",
    "this information is diluted due to the possible mixing of the second b hadron .",
    "the other particles in the  jet ( produced in the fragmentation of the b quark ) also carry some useful information .",
    "the tagging information was extracted using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the event was divided into two hemispheres by the plane perpendicular to the thrust axis and containing the @xmath83 interaction point . in the hemisphere",
    "opposite to that containing the jet , up to three pieces of information were used to tag the b hadron flavour :    * the jet charge  of the highest energy jet in the opposite hemisphere , defined as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the longitudinal momentum component with respect to the jet axis and @xmath117 the charge of track @xmath118 , and the sum is taken over all tracks in the jet .",
    "the parameter @xmath119 was set to 0.5 , as in @xcite . * the charge  of a secondary vertex (",
    "if existing ) , reconstructed in any jet in the opposite hemisphere , as in @xcite .",
    "a well reconstructed charged vertex indicates a  or  hadron , tagging the parent quark as a  or b respectively , whilst a neutral or badly reconstructed vertex gives no information on the b quark flavour . * the charge of a high momentum lepton found in any jet in the opposite hemisphere , selected as in @xcite .",
    "a high momentum lepton is most likely to come from a b hadron decay , again tagging the parent b or  quark according to its charge .",
    "a neural network algorithm was used to suppress fake leptons and those coming from cascade charm decays ( @xmath120 ) which have the wrong charge correlation .",
    "these variables were combined using a neural network algorithm into a single tagging variable  for the opposite hemisphere @xcite , quantifying the confidence with which the hemisphere was tagged as containing a b or  hadron .",
    "different neural networks were used depending on what combination of vertex and/or lepton variables were available to combine with the jet charge .    in the hemisphere containing the  jet , only the jet charge  can be used to infer the  production flavour .",
    "was calculated using equation  [ e : jetc ] , but with the parameter @xmath119 set to zero , so it becomes simply the average of the charges of the tracks in the jet .",
    "this avoids being sensitive to the decay flavour of the  ( and hence whether it has mixed or not ) , but is still sensitive to the production flavour via the information carried by the fragmentation tracks in the jet @xcite .",
    "the jet charge  was used to generate a second hemisphere tagging variable independent of the opposite hemisphere variable .",
    "the two tagging variables were combined to produce a single tag @xmath121 for the  production flavour , as in @xcite .",
    "the continuous variable @xmath121 ranges from @xmath122 to @xmath123 , and is defined such that events with @xmath124 are tagged with complete confidence as containing a produced , events with @xmath125 are tagged with complete confidence as containing a produced , and events with @xmath126 are equally likely to be  or .",
    "the modulus @xmath127 satisfies @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the ` mis - tag ' probability , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability to tag the production flavour incorrectly .",

    "31% of signal events are tagged incorrectly .",
    "the event - by - event weighting reduces this to an effective mis - tag of 28% , equivalent to a 33% increase in statistical sensitivity .",
    "the values of  and  were extracted using an unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit to the reconstructed mass difference , proper time @xmath66 and mixing tag @xmath134 of each event .",
    "both opposite and same sign events with @xmath135 and @xmath136ps were used in the fit , the high  and same sign events serving to constrain the combinatorial background normalisation and shapes in the opposite sign low   region populated by the  decays .",
    "using the  value from each event in the fit , rather than just dividing the data into low  ` signal ' and high   ` sideband ' mass regions , increases the statistical sensitivity as the signal purity varies considerably within the low  region .",
