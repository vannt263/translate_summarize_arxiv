    "it is well known that the all - particle spectrum of primary cosmic rays follows a power law of dj / de @xmath0 e@xmath1 , but steepens at energies around 4@xmath210@xmath3 ev where the power index @xmath4 changes sharply from @xmath52.7 to @xmath53.1  @xcite .",
    "such structure of the all - particle energy spectrum is called the  knee \" , which is considered to be closely related to the origin , acceleration and propagation mechanism of cosmic rays . in order to explain the existence of the knee ,",
    "many hypotheses and mechanisms  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "although all these approaches can well describe the knee structure , there are much discrepancies in the prediction of the individual components at the knee region .",
    "thus , it is critical to measure the primary chemical composition or mass group at energies 50 - 10000 tev , especially , to measure the primary energy spectra of individual component and determine a break energy of the spectral index for individual component .",
    "direct cosmic - ray measurements on board balloons or satellites are the best way to study the chemical composition , while the maximum energy they can cover is up to 10@xmath6 ev / nucleon at most due to limited detection area or exposure time .",
    "we may have no choice but to rely on ground - based air - shower ( as ) measurements to study the primary chemical composition around the knee .",
    "the study of cosmic - ray composition around the knee was done by a hybrid experiment of the emulsion chambers ( ecs ) , the burst detectors ( bds ) and the as array ( tibet - ii ) , where ecs and bds of total area 80 m@xmath7 were set up near the center of the as array and operated for three years  @xcite . the threshold energy of ecs capable of analyzing the fine structure of as cores is about 1 tev , so that it is not difficult to separate the as events induced by light - component of protons and helium nuclei , while the energy range of primary particles is limited to be above @xmath5200 tev for protons and @xmath5400 tev for helium nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this experiment suggests that the flux of light component is less than @xmath530% of the total , resulting in that the knee is dominated by nuclei heavier than helium  @xcite .",
    "a demerit of this experiment is that there are few statistics of the high - energy core events due to the high detection threshold energy of the experiment as mentioned above . to improve this problem ,",
    "a new air - shower core detector named yac ( yangbajing air shower core detector ) has been developed and improved so as to meet our requirements .",
    "one important improvement is to lower the detection threshold energy of primary particles to several times 10 tev , about one order of magnitude smaller than the previous experiment . with this improvement",
    ", the energy spectra of individual components measured by yac will overlap with those of direct measurements , which may help us to examine the knee of light component , such as  proton knee \" or  helium knee \" .",
    "another important improvement of yac is its ability to count the number of shower particles passing through each detector in a wide dynamic ranging from 1 to 10@xmath8 particles , making it possible to observe the primary cosmic rays in the energy range from @xmath510 tev to @xmath510 pev .    until now ,",

    "[ figure-05]-(b ) that the flux values by sibyll2.1 , qgsjetii-04 and epos - lhc using the same primary model of he - poor match well with an error of smaller than 10% , which may be attributed to uncertainties due to the interaction models used .",

    "this figure tells us that the gaisser - fit primary model gives smaller lateral spread than others , while the qgsjetii-04+he - poor model gives larger spread than others . as protons with the long interaction",

    "the gaisser - fit primary is light - component dominant as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure-03 ] , so that the core spread by this model should be smaller than others . when the primary model is fixed as he - poor , the mean spread of qgsjetii-04 is slightly larger than that of sibyll2.1 .",
    "this may slightly depend on the interaction model since the energy spectrum of secondary particles in the very forward region ( feynman @xmath46 0.1 - 0.3 ) produced at collision in the sibyll2.1 model is harder than that of qgsjetii-04 , that is , the former contains slightly larger number of very high - energy secondaries than the latter .",
    "the difference of the intensity and lateral spread between both models could be attributed to the number of very high energy particles as those penetrate deep in the atmosphere .",
    "it should be noted that the lateral spread of as - cores is mostly caused by coulomb scattering of shower electrons and positrons in the atmosphere , not by transverse momentum of secondaries produced at collisions except within the depth of 1 - 2 radiation lengths from the interaction point in the atmosphere . in connection with this ,",
    "the energy loss of as cores generated by qgsjetii-04 may be faster than those by sibyll2.1 , resulting in giving lower as - core intensity . hence , a precise as experiment like the ( yac + tibet - iii as ) array will be able to examine the interaction models to some extent .      in this analysis",

    "the air - shower core events observed with the yac - i array were analyzed to select those induced by the light component using the ann technique . in this paper , we focused on the sensitivity of the yac - i array to observe the light component of cosmic rays around the knee and discussed the systematic errors coming from the the models used in the mc indispensable for obtaining the result which should be independent on the model as possible .",
    "it is shown that the yac+tibet as array is powerful to study the primary cosmic - ray chemical composition , in particular , to obtain the energy spectrum of light - component ( p+he ) of cosmic rays at the knee energies .",
    "a full - scale yac consisting of 400 core detectors covering more than 5000 m@xmath7 could be operated together with the tibet - iii array in the very near future .",
    "the authors would like to express their thanks to the members of the tibet as@xmath4 collaboration for the fruitful discussion .",

    "<S> a new air - shower core - detector array ( yac : yangbajing air - shower core - detector array ) has been developed to measure the primary cosmic - ray composition at the  knee \" energies in tibet , china , focusing mainly on the light components . the prototype experiment ( yac - i ) consisting of 16 detectors has been constructed and operated at yangbajing ( 4300 m a.s.l . ) in tibet since may 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> yac - i is installed in the tibet - iii as array and operates together . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a monte carlo simulation to check the sensitivity of yac - i+tibet - iii array to the cosmic - ray light component of cosmic rays around the knee energies , taking account of the observation conditions of actual yac - i+tibet - iii array . </S>",
    "<S> the selection of light component from others was made by use of an artificial neural network ( ann ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation shows that the light - component spectrum estimated by our methods can well reproduce the input ones within 10% error , and there will be about 30% systematic errors mostly induced by the primary and interaction models used . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the full - scale yac and the tibet - iii array is powerful to study the cosmic - ray composition , in particular , to obtain the energy spectra of protons and helium nuclei around the knee energies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : cosmic rays , hadronic interaction , knee , composition , energy spectrum </S>"
