    "pursuing new ideas is a fundamental characteristic of our modern society , where brand - new goods are always ready to push their predecessors off the market .",
    "innovation is one of the most important keywords to understand our society in this sense , as earlier societies were shaped by traditional ideas to be conserved in an unaltered form as much as possible .",
    "for this reason , there have been extensive empirical economic and business studies on how innovations get started , diffused and approved in a society , and it is becoming an attractive topic in statistical physics as well  @xcite . in a classical work  @xcite about diffusion of innovations , rogers claimed that there is a common pattern in innovation dynamics , that people adopting an innovation are normally distributed in time . as a result",
    ", the cumulative number of adopters is expected to show an @xmath0-shaped pattern over time , which is described by the error function : it grows slowly at first , expands rapidly at some point , and then slowly saturates to 100% .",
    "deviation from the mean adoption time , @xmath1 , over the entire population defines five adopter categories such as innovators ( @xmath2 , 2.5% ) , early adopters ( @xmath3 , 13.5% ) , the early majority ( @xmath4 , 34% ) , the late majority ( @xmath5 , 34% ) , and laggards ( @xmath6 , 16% ) , where @xmath7 is the standard deviation of adoption time .",
    "if normality was true , it might reflect variations in individual innovativeness , which is possibly an aggregate of numerous random events and is normally distributed over the population . however , this is a purely static picture of a non - communicating population and it is an implausible description of an innovative society .    at the same time , rogers suggested a dynamic origin of this @xmath0-shaped pattern by comparing it to an epidemic process .",
    "a relevant description is then more likely to be a logistic function ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) than the error function .",
    "a logistic function is basically written as @xmath8 , which grows from zero to one as time @xmath9 goes from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . here",
    ", the assumption is that there is a _ single _ innovation like a disease , diffusing into a passive population .",
    "however , the problem with this approach is that ideas are evolving during the course of adoption , and innovation researchers are already well aware that people actively modify an adopted idea whenever it is possible and necessary , which is termed re - invention  @xcite as a consequence , it is the rule rather than the exception that every modified innovation may well compete with all its predecessors , so the picture becomes more colorful than the dichotomy of a new idea versus an old one . in short",
    ", this epidemic description does not capture the genuine dynamic feature of innovations , and even more refined mathematical approaches such as the bass model do not overcome such limitations  @xcite .",
    "this issue is also deeply related to the pro - innovation bias of diffusion research  @xcite , which means that one tends to overlook such an innovation that dies out by rejection or replaced by a better one .",
    "although there have been statistical - physical approaches to introduce many competing ideas into the dynamics of innovation  @xcite , they are rather focused on scaling behavior under specific stochastic rules than comparing the findings with empirical observations .    to sum up , analytic concepts are lacking to explain actual patterns of innovation diffusion as a fully dynamic process with a multitude of ideas competing simultaneously .",
    "for this reason , we consider simple ideal competition among ideas whose values are so well - defined that everyone can adopt a better idea as soon as she encounters it , without any barriers against the diffusion of innovations .",
    "even if this picture is unrealistic , it is theoretically intriguing , and can serve as a reference point to start with when assessing innovations in practice . in particular , our results suggest that the interplay of adoption and exploration must be considered to achieve a plausible minimalist description , which leads to neither normal nor logistic but slightly skewed behavior as a signature of an ideal innovative society .",
    "this simple explanation is in contrast to many variants of the logistic growth model that describe asymmetry in empirical @xmath0-shaped patterns  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis tells us that the speed of progress in ideas is coupled to how broadly ideas are distributed in the society : a fast innovating society tends to be accompanied by a broad spectrum of ideas , some of which can be far from state - of - the - art . it should be kept in mind that the term ` ideal ' is absolutely unrelated to any judgments of value concerning the phenomena that we are investigating but only means that we are considering a conceptual construct that can be pursued analytically .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that every idea is assigned a scalar value @xmath12 representing its quality .",
    "this automatically implies that this quantity is transitive without any cyclic dominance among ideas , and the strict dominance relationship between any pair of distinct ideas prevents people from revisiting old ideas . a difference from ref .",
    "@xcite is that @xmath12 can take any _",
    "real _ value , not only an integer .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the fraction of the population choosing ideas between @xmath12 and @xmath14 at time @xmath9 .",
    "we then call @xmath15 a probability density function ( pdf ) of idea @xmath12 .",
    "our population dynamics approach on the mean - field level suggests that the relative growth rate @xmath16 is proportional to the fraction of those with @xmath17 as they are potential adopters of @xmath12 .",
    "this fraction is , by definition , the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath18 and we thus have @xmath19 p(x , t ) , \\label{eq : dp}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a positive proportionality constant representing the rate of adoption , which can be set as unity by using a rescaled time @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the average of @xmath23 over the population . note that the total probability is always conserved because @xmath24 = 0 $ ]  @xcite . an alternative way to derive eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp ] ) is to start from a master equation  @xcite : @xmath25 where the first term describes an inflow adopting @xmath12 and the second term describes an outflow adopting higher values than @xmath12 .",
    "it could also be modified by inserting suitable kernel functions into the integrals .",

    "clearly , eq .  ( [ eq : dp3 ] ) implies that the expression inside the brackets is a function of @xmath9 and independent of @xmath12 .",
    "inserting the boundary condition at @xmath33 , the expression inside the bracket is @xmath42 at every @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the equation to be solved is the following : @xmath44 the solution can be found as @xmath45 \\label{eq : cdf}\\ ] ] with a certain function @xmath46 .",
    "the definition of @xmath47 requires @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in terms of the pdf , it means that @xmath51 { \\rm sech}^2 \\left [ g(x ) - \\frac{kt}{4 } \\right ] , \\label{eq : sol}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath46 is an arbitrary function satisfying @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it can be readily checked that it contains the stationary delta function as a special case .",

    "as the speed decreases , the wave becomes sharper [ fig .",

    "\\label{eq : box}\\ ] ] as time goes by , it converges to a delta peak at @xmath65 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss](b ) ] .",
    "let us return to the general solution [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sol ] ) ] . for any @xmath46 and @xmath66",
    ", the fraction of the population having passed this innovation level @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 , increases as a logistic function of @xmath9 .",
    "however , it should be noted that our starting point was not meant to be the logistic growth model .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath15 is fully determined once @xmath46 is given by the initial condition , suggesting that innovation history is already determined at the starting point as long as the rate of adoption @xmath20 remains unaltered .",
    "if the initial condition is nonzero only over a finite range of @xmath68 $ ] , for example , @xmath15 always evolves to a delta function at @xmath69 .",
    "this deficiency makes it difficult to gain insight on the innovation dynamics from the current formulation , revealing its incompleteness .",
    "the reason is that our current formulation does not include any generative mechanism for innovations .",
    "therefore , we add another term to the adoption dynamics considered so far . it could be argued that individual exploration for different ideas can be modeled more or less by a brownian random walk along the @xmath12-axis : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a measure of exploratory efforts . because it yields a normal distribution with variance @xmath72 ,",
    "this could be interpreted as invoking the classical idea of normality in the diffusion of innovations , but this normality enters as a consequence of the dynamic exploration process rather than a static trait",
    ". it also expresses a conservative viewpoint that an individual alone achieves only small modifications that may even degenerate equally .",
    "this is obviously a huge simplification about the human mind , but we shall be content with such a minimalist description at the moment . adding this exploratory mechanism to the adoption , the resulting equation is written as @xmath73 by rescaling @xmath41 and @xmath74 , we set both parameters @xmath20 and @xmath71 as unity . notably , eq .  ( [ eq : diff ] )",
    "does not have a stationary solution for the following reason : when @xmath75 , the solution for eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) is given as weierstrass elliptic function , which is even and does not satisfy the boundary condition of @xmath47 at @xmath33 .",
    "this might look counter - intuitive at first glance as the pdf tends to converge to a single point due to adoption , which could be balanced by exploration .",
    "however , a more correct picture is that the pdf converges to a _ higher _ position than the center , so it gradually moves upward via exploration instead of staying at a fixed position .",
    "this notion turns out to be plausible as will be explained shortly below .",
    "if we consider the boundary condition , the actual equation to solve here is given as @xmath76 which can be shown identical to fisher s equation  @xcite by simply changing the variables .",
    "fisher s equation was originally devised to describe the frequency of a single mutant gene in a one - dimensional population rather than a cdf , and it is interesting that the same equation arises in the context of an infinite series of mutants in an infinite - dimensional ( i.e. , mean - field ) population .",
    "this equation has been extensively studied in biology and physics as one of the simplest reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite .",
    "we only mention the basics of the known results about fisher s equation and those who are interested in comprehensive discussions may refer to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    equation  ( [ eq : fisher ] ) admits traveling wave solutions , and preserves the shapes during propagation .",
    "the traveling wave solutions are stable against small perturbations within a finite domain , moving with the waves .",
    "each speed builds up a unique wave shape , and speed @xmath77 is determined by the tail of the initial cdf in the following manner : if @xmath78 with @xmath79 as @xmath80 at initial time @xmath81 , the speed of the wavefront asymptotically converges to @xmath82 when @xmath83 , and @xmath84 when @xmath85 . in short , a longer tail leads to a faster propagating wave .",
    "even if an initial pdf has bounded support , i.e. , @xmath86 only for @xmath87 , a traveling wave solution will develop with @xmath88 instead of a delta function .",
    "the information on the initial condition other than the tail exponent becomes irrelevant in the asymptotic limit due to the random - walk process .",
    "there is no traveling wave solution below @xmath89 , which is consistent with the impossibility of a stationary solution as stated above .",
    "another important feature is that the characteristic width @xmath90 of the wavefront is proportional to @xmath91 because @xmath71 and @xmath20 compete to determine width .",
    "in contrast , speed is expressed as @xmath92 as both the mechanisms of exploration and adoption make positive contributions . as a consequence , the characteristic time for a wavefront to pass through a particular point",
    "@xmath12 is not sensitive to @xmath71 because @xmath93 .",

    "-\\tanh^2 \\left [ \\frac{x}{4\\sqrt{3d / k } } - \\frac{5k}{24}(t - t_0)\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : special}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a reference point in time  @xcite . as",
    "this expression is handy to maintain qualitative features unaltered , we will focus on this solution to observe differences from the normal or logistic descriptions .",
    "the numbers presented here should be taken as indicating qualitative features of the solution , and not as universal values for arbitrary @xmath77 .",
    "the shape of the wave @xmath15 is obtained by differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq : special ] ) with respect to @xmath12 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff](a ) at @xmath96 . as is clearly shown there",
    ", this pdf is not symmetric but skewed negatively , i.e. , with a longer tail on the left side .",
    "the skewness is quantified from the second and third moments as @xmath97 .",
    "due to this skewness , while the mean is @xmath98 , the maximum is located at @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , the most commonly observed idea tends to lead us to overestimate the population mean .",
    "recall the five categories defined with respect to the _ mean _ adoption time , which is given by our @xmath15 as @xmath100 \\big/ \\left [ \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x=0;t ) dt \\right ] = \\frac{12}{5}$ ] , when @xmath101 and the idea to adopt has value @xmath102 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : diff](b ) ] .",
    "the standard deviation around @xmath1 is @xmath103 , from which we can compute fractions of the five categories as @xmath104 ( innovators ) , @xmath105 ( early adopters ) , @xmath106 ( early majority ) , @xmath107 ( late majority ) , and @xmath108 ( laggards ) .",
    "note that the fraction of innovators is only one half of the existing estimate based on the normality .",
    "this is due to the inherent skewness of the pdf as a solution for this dynamics .",
    "the shape of @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff](b ) can also be interpreted as the typical fate of idea @xmath12 , spread by adoption but soon dominated by its descendant @xmath14 .",
    "although eq .  (",
    "[ eq : special ] ) describes only a special case of a specific velocity , we can verify whether it fits to the empirical data set found in ref .",
    "@xcite . recall that a traveling wave with @xmath88 emerges from any initial pdf with a sufficiently short tail , which we presume is close to reality in many cases .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to directly work with this solution , but it is more difficult to handle than the analytic solution eq .",
    "( [ eq : special ] ) for practical purposes",
    ". fortunately , the analytic solution shows little difference in its shape compared to the solution with @xmath89 .",
    "thus , we work with eq .",

[ fig : pub](a ) shows the cumulative numbers of publications on the diffusion of innovations every 4 years from 1940 to 1996 .",
    "as we approach the late 1990s , the rate of increase decreases , but it is not symmetric with the early take - off around the 1960s .",
    "that is , the shape is slightly skewed as our theory suggests [ fig .",

    "when compared to fittings with the error function and the logistic function , this functional form actually provides a better explanation , in the sense that the sum of squared deviations becomes one half of each of theirs [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pub](b ) ] . from this fitting",
    ", we can estimate the rate of adoption @xmath110 . plugging this value into eq .",
    "( [ eq : special ] ) , we suggest that the relevant time scale of adopting the diffusion concept of innovations amounts to @xmath111 years .",
    "one could argue from this excellent fit that the research field is close to the ideal situation that we have considered : researchers are relatively open - minded about new ideas and their communication is not much restricted by geographic factors . based on this idea , the deviation of empirical adoption patterns from the predicted curve can serve as an indicator to quantify barriers against diffusion of innovations . for example",
    ", a classical study of diffusion research on the hybrid corn in iowa  @xcite shows a positively skewed pdf contrary to the prediction , which may hint at the strong resistance by the farmers to the new idea at the early stage .",
    "our second example in fig .",
    "[ fig : pub](c ) shows broadband penetration rates in european countries , as published by eurostat  @xcite .",
    "this quantity means the number of high - speed connections ( @xmath112 144 kbits / s ) per 100 inhabitants .",
    "the figure tells us that the broadband penetration in greece started about 3 years later than that in the uk , and its saturation level in the future will be @xmath113 lower than that of the uk . despite these differences ,",
    "the relevant time scales of adoption are estimated to be about 3 years for both countries .",
    "in fact , the rates of adoption , evaluated from the broadband penetration rates , do not change much across european countries .",
    "table  [ table : fit ] shows the least - square fitting results of eq .",
    "( [ eq : special ] ) to the broadband penetration rates from 2002 to 2010 in eu member countries  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : sii ] , we plot the resulting @xmath20 values in table  [ table : fit ] .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the summary innovation index ( sii ) , which has been developed to assess aggregate national innovation performance of the eu member countries  @xcite .",
    "it is a composite index showing how many relevant indicators such as education , employment and r&d are above or below eu averages .",
    "figure  [ fig : sii ] suggests that the differences in innovativeness measured by the sii can not be explained by the differences in the rates of adoption . therefore ,",
    "if we use the sii as a proxy variable for measuring speed @xmath114 , the differences in the sii should be explained by variations in the measure @xmath71 of exploration activity .",
    "if @xmath20 is uniform , our model predicts that more diverse values of @xmath12 will be observed in a society where innovation occurs faster because both @xmath77 and @xmath90 scale as @xmath115 .",
    "the abundance of laggards with low @xmath12 results from the fast innovation but also fuels it as market potential , and both effects are incorporated in the solution .",
    "in summary , we have studied an ideal innovative society where a better idea has a better chance to diffuse into the population .",
    "our model is characterized by competition among an infinite number of ideas . in the presence of an adoption mechanism only , we are able to find the full solution exhibiting logistic behavior , but it is a purely deterministic view leaving the concept of innovation obscure . by adding another term for exploratory behavior , which connects to the classical idea of normality",
    ", we have found traveling wave solutions as described by fisher s equation , whose velocity is proportional to the square root of exploration activity @xmath71 times the rate of adoption @xmath20 . at the same time , its width is proportional to @xmath91 due to the competition of adoption and exploration . incorporating both the normal and logistic features , the shape of the solution is neither normal nor logistic but negatively skewed , leading to a discrepancy between the mean and the mode as well as a significantly smaller size estimate of innovators compared to that of the conventional theory .",
    "it is compared with the asymmetry in empirical adoption patterns and proposed as a reference point to assess the effectiveness in diffusion of innovations .",
    "furthermore , as the rates of adoption do not vary much across countries , we predict a tendency for the width of a distribution to be positively correlated with the overall speed of innovations .",

    "<S> thus , the typical adoption pattern is predicted to be asymmetric with slow saturation in the ideal situation , which is compared with empirical data sets . </S>"
