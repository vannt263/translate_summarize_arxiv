    "meso - scale structures are very important for understanding of network properties and dynamics .",
    "considerable investigations have focused on the study of a particular type of meso - scale structure known as community structure which has some cohesive groups called `` communities '' , nodes in the same community are connected densely to each other , whereas nodes in different communities are connected sparsely  @xcite . in an ideal community structure , nodes in the same community are full connected , and there is no connection between nodes in different communities .",
    "the adjacency matrix of block model representing ideal community structure is given in fig.1(a ) .",
    "various techniques have been developed to detect community structure  @xcite , e.g. , the algorithms were based on modularity  @xcite , random walks  @xcite , spectral clustering  @xcite , hierarchical clustering  @xcite , nonnegative matrix factorization approach  @xcite and so on .",
    "there are also many algorithms for overlapping community detection based on label propagation  @xcite , link partition  @xcite , clique percolation theory  @xcite , etc .",
    "another meso - scale structure known as core - periphery ( abbreviated as cp ) structure has not received enough attention , but it has been examined in the networks of society  @xcite , scientific citation  @xcite , international trade  @xcite and other fields  @xcite . for instance , maintaining a party or an organization often needs an elite group to organize and manage it . the elite group is composed of highly influential and powerful individuals who have more connections with each other .",
    "and other people involved , namely the periphery part with few connections inside are less organized and less dominant  @xcite .",
    "biological networks , such as that of the human brain , where a group of densely connected network nodes provides long - term functionality and robustness ( core ) , while another group of sparsely connected nodes is responsible for adaptation on short time scales to changing conditions in the environment ( periphery )  @xcite .",
    "all of these phenomena are the expressions of cp structure , indicating the significance of studying the cp structure  @xcite .",
    "although the two meso - scale structures were studied more or less , the relationship between them is not well clarified .",
    "in fact , there are some intuitive relationships between the two typical meso - scale structures : on the one hand , a network with an ideal single cp structure ( the adjacency matrix of ideal single cp structure is shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) implies the absence of community structure ; on the other hand , a network with multiple cp structure ( the adjacency matrix of ideal multiple cp structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(c ) ) often implies the existence of community structure .",
    "however , community structure does not imply the existence of multiple cp structure , if there are no closely connected core nodes and more loosely connected periphery nodes in each community , the multiple cp structure does not appear .",
    "correctly understand the relationship can help us distinguish the two meso - scale structures and design effective methods to detect both of them .",
    "up to now , the definition of cp structure is unclear even though it widely exists in many real systems .",
    "a more formal and rather popular definition was proposed by borgatti and everett  @xcite , in which a node belongs to a core if and only if it is well connected both to other core nodes and to periphery nodes , and periphery nodes do not connect with other periphery nodes .",
    "the adjacency matrices of block models with respect to the ideal single cp structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(b )  @xcite .",
    "since the definition of ideal cp structure is too strict to meet , a looser definition of cp structure is that core nodes are highly interconnected and periphery nodes frays into a tree  @xcite .",
    "however , it is a descriptive definition , the strict definition from mathematics has not been well proposed .",
    "the existing cp detection methods were mainly implemented by checking how well a network approximates the ideal case .",
    "the methods are often criticized due to several shortcomings : first , the methods need to give the size of core in advance ; second , the methods rudely divide a network into a single cp structure , however , many real networks present multiple cp structure .",
    "more importantly , multiple cp structure and community structure may coexist in many real networks , the methods do not provide a unified framework to detect the both meso - scale structures .",
    "inspired by these reasons , the goal of this paper is to propose a unified method to detect cp structure and community structure . in doing so , we firstly rank all nodes according to a connection density indictor , then we can judge whether the network exhibits a single cp structure , multiple cp structure or community structure based on the defined region density curves .",
    "moreover , the multi - scale of cp structure and the overlapping nodes can be detected too .",
    "to summarize , the main contributions of the work are as follows .    1 .",
    "we propose a unified method to detect cp structure and community structure simultaneously .",
    "multiple cp structure can also be detected .",
    "moreover , each periphery node is assigned a class value denoting the closeness with its core group .",
    "3 .   the overlapping and active nodes taking part in different communities can be detected , furthermore , multi - scale of cp structure can be found by adjusting the size of core  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - rela ] ,",
    "we briefly recall the related work on cp detection algorithms and overlapping community detection . the detailed descriptions of our method are described in section [ sec : alg ] .",
    "empirical results on several typical networks are presented in section [ sec : exp ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "the detection of cp structure has not been well studied , this problem is formally considered in a brief review written by borgatti and everett  @xcite . in this review , authors formalized the notion of a cp structure and also proposed several intuitive algorithms to detect this structure .",
    "a discrete - version algorithms aims to find a vector @xmath0 of length @xmath1 whose entries can be either 1 or 0 .",
    "the @xmath2th entry @xmath3 equals 1 if the corresponding node is assigned to the core , otherwise , it equals 0 if the corresponding node is assigned to the periphery . and define a pattern matrix with the element @xmath4 if @xmath5 or @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 otherwise . at last , a core quality @xmath8 is defined to measure how well a network approximates the ideal case , where @xmath9 is the element of adjacency matrix @xmath10 .",
    "they also presented a continuous version in which each node is assigned a continue `` coreness '' value between 0 and 1 , and the element of the pattern matrix @xmath11 . the continue version",
    "is further developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the `` coreness '' of each node is defined in different ways .",
    "moreover , some heuristic methods , such as based on miners were proposed to maximize the core quality @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "all of them are to make sure the core quality @xmath12 as large as possible , which is sensitively dependent on the ideal block adjacency matrix .",
    "therefore , the size of core is fixed in advance .",
    "also , the complexity of algorithms are high .",
    "some methods based on centrality indices , including network capacity  @xcite , geodesic paths  @xcite , knotty centrality and so forth  @xcite , were proposed to divide nodes with high centrality values as the core .",
    "however , hereafter , we will address that nodes with high centrality value are not always the cores .",
    "in addition , rossa _",
    "et  al . _",
    "proposed a detection method by deleting the nodes with the smallest persistence probability @xmath13 , which is calculated by implementing the behaviour of a random walker in networks  @xcite .",
    "et  al . _ also proposed a method for the detection of cp structure by fitting a stochastic block model to observed network data using a maximum likelihood method  @xcite .",
    "however , these methods fail in detecting multiple cp structures , or can not detect community structure simultaneously , or hold a high computational cost .",
    "the performance of different methods can not be well compared owing to the following two reasons : on the one hand , there is no a recognized and standard indictor to measure which one method is better ; on the other hand , previous methods need to fix the size of core group in advance , which restricts the comparison of different methods .",
    "how to detect overlapping communities has been recognized to be one of the hot areas in the last few years .",
    "the most well - known algorithm is the clique percolation method ( cpm ) proposed by palla _",
    "et al_. cpm builds up communities from k - cliques , where two k - cliques are said to be adjacent if they share @xmath14 nodes .",
    "communities are the connected components of the clique adjacency matrix .",
    "since the high computational complexity of cpm , some methods were proposed .",
    "such as , kumpula _ et al .",
    "_ have proposed a fast sequential clique percolation algorithm , the main idea of the algorithm is to decrement the number of comparisons between cliques when determining whether the found cliques can be merged into larger communities  @xcite .",
    "a link community detection algorithm considering hierarchical and overlapping relationships between nodes simultaneously was proposed by ahn _",
    "_ , the idea of it is to partition links instead of nodes to discover community structure  @xcite .",
    "similar idea has also been considered by evans _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "one shortcoming of link community method is that too many overlapping nodes are detected .",
    "another type of overlapping community detection is based on local expansion or optimization , where a community is detected by maximizing a local fitness function from a seed in the network to be detected .",
    "for example , lancichinetti _ et al . _",
    "proposed a local expansion and optimization algorithm ( lfm ) , where a fitness function for detecting communities is defined , and a node is randomly selected to expand its group members by that function  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also developed a fast overlapping community search ( focs ) method , which is also based on the idea of local expansion and optimization  @xcite .",
    "overlapping community structure can be also found by extending the traditional label propagation algorithm by allowing a node in the network to have multilabels during the process of propagating the labels  @xcite .",
    "all of these overlapping community detection methods just focus on how to detect overlapping structure but do not concern the cp structure .",
    "in this section we describe the method used for detecting both cp structure and community structure .",
    "consider an undirected and unweighted network , the general framework of our method is presented in algorithm 1 , which consists of three main steps : 1 ) we re - rank all nodes in a new sequence ; 2 ) the region density of each node is calculated , and the region density curve is plotted ; 3 ) we detect main meso - scale structures of the network based on the region density curves .",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 compute region density of node @xmath18 by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath19 @xmath20      consider a network @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the set of nodes and @xmath23 is the set of links .",
    "given that the links between core nodes are denser , so we want to re - rank all nodes such that nodes with more common connections approach each other in the new sequence .",
    "in doing so , we define a set @xmath24 and a set @xmath25 to store re - ranked nodes and the remaining nodes , respectively .",
    "initially , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . to start the sorting process , we need to choose one node as the starting node",
    ". we can choose a node with the highest centrality value since the node is more likely to be core node .",
    "we here choose the node with the highest closeness centrality as the first node in set @xmath24 , and renumber it as @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 ( we found that the results are not dependent on different centrality indices , such as degree , betweenness , eigenvector , and so on  @xcite ) .",
    "now we need to choose a node from @xmath30 and put it into @xmath24 to make sure the new added node has the most connections with the nodes in @xmath24 .",
    "if more than one nodes are found , we choose the node with the maximum degree and put it into @xmath24 .",
    "namely , choose the node with the largest value of @xmath31 and put it into set @xmath24 , which is defined as :    @xmath32    the framework of re - ranking process is given in algorithm 2 :    @xmath33 /*select the node with the highest closeness centrality as the first node*/ @xmath34max@xmath35 add @xmath36 into @xmath24 remove @xmath36 from @xmath30 + /*select the node with the most connections with the nodes in @xmath24 , if more than one node were found , we choose the node with the maximum degree*/ @xmath37 compute priority of node @xmath2 by eq .",

    "for instance , the nodes in the karate club network can be re - ranked in this way .",
    "the network consists of 34 nodes that represent club members and 78 links that represent friendships among members  @xcite .",
    "the club was split into two social groups because of a conflict of the club president and the instructor , as shown in fig .",
    "according to our defined re - ranking way , node 1 is firstly put into the set @xmath24 owing to its the highest closeness value ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) .",
    "though there are a lot of nodes in @xmath30 connecting to node 1 , node 3 is secondly added into @xmath24 since it has the maximal degree value ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) . at this time",
    ", nodes 1 and 3 are included in set @xmath24 .",
    "next , nodes 2 , 4 , 14 , 8 and 9 in @xmath30 connecting to all of nodes in @xmath24 , however , node @xmath46 is added into @xmath24 since its degree value is the largest .",
    "repeat the above steps until @xmath47 , then all nodes are renumbered ( the re - ranked numbers are shown in the curve of fig .",
    "3(b ) ) .",
    "we first define a local indicator  connection density ( cd ) to characterize the density of connections in a subgraph @xmath48 , which is given as : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of nodes in @xmath48 and @xmath51 is the number of existing connections in @xmath48 .",
    "a parameter @xmath52 is defined to measure the minimal size of core .",
    "for a given value of @xmath52 , the region density of a node @xmath53 is defined as the connection density of subgraph consisting of nodes from @xmath54 to itself , i.e. , @xmath55    we mainly set @xmath56 in this work , with @xmath57 be the average degree of network and @xmath58 be the integral function ( in the next context , we also address that different scales of meso - scale structures can be observed by adjusting the value of @xmath52 ) .",
    "we can draw a region density curve after calculating the value of rd regarding to each node , where the horizontal axis denotes the node sequence defined in sec .",
    "3.1 , and the ordinate axis is the value of rd ( see fig .",
    "the framework of plotting region density curve is summarized in algorithm 3 :    @xmath59 @xmath60 + /*if the values of rd for two sequential nodes are greater than or equal to @xmath61 , the two cores are merged as a single one*/ @xmath62    @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath39 @xmath65 and @xmath66      we define a subgraph @xmath48 be a core if the @xmath67 is larger than a threshold value @xmath61 .",
    "larger value of @xmath61 gives rise to the stricter definition of core .",
    "once the region density curve is presented , the meso - scale structures can be detected by comparing how many peaks are larger than or equal to @xmath61 , note that some peaks in the beginning of the curve are not valid even though whose @xmath68 .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath69 , the first three nodes in the region density curve can not form core even though @xmath70 or @xmath71 , since the number of nodes is smaller than the minimal size of core @xmath52 . moreover ,",
    "if the values of rd for two sequential nodes are greater than or equal to @xmath61 , the two cores or communities are merged as a single one .",
    "a region density curve of networks with cp structure has the following characteristic : the difference between maximum and minimum values is very huge , and the values of @xmath72 for most nodes are very low .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the number of periphery nodes is far greater than the number of core nodes , and the connections among core nodes are very dense but among periphery nodes are very few .",
    "4 schematically shows the region density curves of three types of ideal meso - scale structures .",
    "the region density curves in fig .",
    "4(a ) and fig .",
    "4(b ) correspond to an ideal single cp structure and ideal multiple cp structure , respectively .",
    "the region density curves of a community structure without cp structure is similar to a cosine curve , where the difference between peak and least values is not so huge , as shown in fig .",
    "of course , the number of community structures in network is determined by the number of the peaks which reach the value of @xmath61 . in sum",
    ", we can judge the meso - scale structure of a network according to its region density curve .",
    ", which are used to determine the number of sub - cp structures or communities .",
    ", width=480 ]    though we can determine the core node and the number of cores based on the region density curve , some important problems should be further considered .",
    "firstly , when multiple cp structure is detected , we should know that the periphery nodes belong to which core and how close with their core nodes ; secondly , when community structure exists in a network , can we find the overlapping nodes who belong to different communities ? to this end , we begin to expand periphery nodes from each core to form its sub - cp structure . at the beginning , each sub - cp structures only contains core nodes themselves and they are defined as class 0 .",
    "the periphery nodes who have direct connections with core nodes are valued as class 1 , and they are pre - allocated to the core which has the most connections with them . in this way , one or several initial sub - cp structures are formed ( each sub - cp structure only contains core nodes and their periphery neighbors ) .",
    "next , the neighbors of the initial sub - cp structures are defined as class 2 , and they are pre - allocated to the sub - cp structure which has the most connection with them .",
    "the expanding process finishes until all periphery nodes are pre - allocated and their class values are determined .",
    "many experimental results have demonstrated that most of real networks are `` small - world '' , i.e. , their average length of paths are very short  @xcite .",
    "thus , the above expanding process can be finished in several steps .",
    "now , we want to address why we need to pre - allocate the periphery nodes .",
    "the reason is that some periphery nodes may be pre - allocated to more than one sub - cp structure or communities , namely , they have the same number of connections with two or several sub - cp / community structures .",
    "these nodes are viewed as active nodes .",
    "one may intuitively think that these active nodes are the overlapping nodes because they connect different sub - cp structures or communities .",
    "however , we should address that many active nodes are not real overlapping nodes , for example , even though an important person need to frequently connect the leaders in different organizations owing to his special role , but which does not mean that the important person belongs to different organizations .",
    "therefore , we need to extract these active nodes and re - distribute them to a sub - cp structure / community who has the most connections with the active nodes . if there are still some nodes who are assigned to more than one sub - cp structure / community , this kind of nodes are viewed as the real overlapping nodes .",
    "the framework of detecting meso - structure is demonstrated in algorithm 4 :    @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 /*pre - allocate the periphery nodes*/ @xmath77 add @xmath78 into @xmath79 remove @xmath80 from @xmath81 + @xmath82@xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath79 /*re - distribute active nodes * / remove @xmath86 from @xmath79 + add @xmath78 into @xmath79    @xmath39 @xmath87    we still use karate club network as an example to help us understand our method . in sec .",
    "3.1 , all nodes have been re - ranked and the region density curve is plotted in fig .",
    "now we should use the number of peaks in the curve to determine the meso - scale structures . according to the assumption @xmath56 , one has @xmath69 owing to @xmath88 .",
    "here we set core density @xmath89 , that is to say , all core nodes are fully connected . as shown in the region density curve ,",
    "the values of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are equal to 1 .",
    "thus , the region formed by these three nodes are @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( though @xmath96 and @xmath97 , neither of them is valid peak since their region is too small to form core ) . because node 4 and node 14 are sequently placed in the curve , the two cores are merged into one larger core , i.e. , @xmath98 .",
    "now there are two cores : @xmath99 and @xmath100 . as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , the red and dark blue nodes ( class 0 ) are core nodes .",
    "according to the above expanding method , we can know that each periphery node belongs to which core and how far from its own core . in the first allocation ,",
    "nodes 10 , 28 and 29 are allocated to the two sub - cp structures , so the three active nodes need to be re - allocated . in the secondary distribution , nodes 28 and 29 are allocated to the right sub - cp structure ( see fig .",
    "however , node 10 still has the same number of connections to the two sub - cp structures , which is viewed as the real overlapping node .",
    "3(d ) shows the adjacency matrix of karate club network , which is very similar to the ideal multiple cp structure shown in fig .",
    "although karate club network has been used as a standard benchmark network for community detection , our result indicates that the meso - scale structure of karate club network is a dual core - periphery structure , leading to a community network with two communities .",
    "we should address that even though some community detection algorithms can divide the karate club network into two groups , which do not clearly clarify each node being core node or periphery node , namely the inner structure in each group is not well answered .",
    "our method not only divides the network into two groups , but also accurately differentiate the core nodes and periphery nodes in each group .",
    "in addition , our method can further distinguish the roles of periphery nodes , identify the active nodes and overlapping nodes simultaneously .",
    "in short , our method provides a more systematic and accurate description of the meso - scale structure and the roles of nodes in networks .",
    "in this section , we examine the meso - scale structures in some real - world networks and a synthetic benchmark network used in community network detection .",

    "each of them has 5 core nodes . and their number of periphery nodes are 3 , 14 , and 1 respectively . generally speaking ,",
    "the number of periphery nodes is larger than the number of core nodes , so only secondary small meso - scale structure can be viewed as a cp structure , the other two are the small scale community structure .",
