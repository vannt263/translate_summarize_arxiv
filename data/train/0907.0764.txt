    "after the soft x - ray and optical counterparts to each of the 4 new hard x - ray source had been identified , _ swift_performed additional observations to obtain more detailed timing and spectral information .",
    "a log of these observations are presented in table[ta : observations ] .    for all pointed observations ,",
    "the xrt was in `` auto '' state , in which the data collection mode is automatically chosen , based on the brightness of the source , to minimize the effects of pile - up .",
    "the two main modes of observing with the xrt are `` photon counting '' ( pc ) and `` window timing '' ( wt ) modes @xcite .",
    "pc mode provides full - field imaging and spectroscopy , with low temporal resolution ( 2.5  s ) .",
    "wt mode provides higher temporal resolution ( 1.8  ms ) at the expense of imaging .",
    "the rt  cru , t  crb , and cd  @xmath157  3057  observations were taken exclusively in pc mode .",
    "for ch  cyg , the one pointed observation was performed in a mixture of wt and pc modes . since the xrt has only a thin optical blocking filter , however , the pc - mode data for ch  cygwere severely contaminated by optical loading on the xrt ccd from the bright m giant . when ch  cyg  was observed in pc mode , the data from all but the wings of the xrt point spread function were therefore effectively useless .",
    "the faster - exposure wt - mode data for ch  cyg  were less affected by optical contamination and therefore suitable for spectral analysis .",
    "we used the _ swift _  release 2.5 software to analyze the data , and we reduced the xrt data in the standard fashion with xrtpipeline .",
    "we determined the coordinates for xrt point sources with xrtcentroid , and performed all timing and spectral analyses with counts extracted from a circular region with a 20-pixel radius around the centroid of the xrt point source .",
    "a region with this radius contains approximately 99% of all counts expected from an xrt point source . to correct for the presence of dead columns on the xrt ccd during timing analysis of xrt data",
    ", we used the standard tool xrtlcorr . for spectral fitting , we used xspec v12.3.0 @xcite and the version-9 xrt calibration products .",
    "we performed simultaneous fits to the spectra from the cumulative xrt observations and those from the 9-month bat survey observations for each source . combining the xrt and bat data allowed us to fit spectra spanning 0.3 to 150 kev .",
    "to search for periodic brightness modulations arising from the wd spin , we performed timing analysis on barycentrically corrected xrt event data for all 4 symbiotic stars . since wd",
    "spin periods typically lie in the range from minutes to a few hours , we calculated the @xmath31 statistic ( e.g. , @xcite ) for each source for a range of periods from 1 minute to 10 hours .",
    "we did not find any significant periodicities in the light curves of any of the symbiotic stars in our sample .    in order to determine the likelihood of detection of a wd spin period in our data , we performed monte - carlo simulations to recreate our data with varying degrees of modulation and periodicities in the 100 to 5000s range , following the most typical range of wd spin periods @xcite .",
    "we found that amplitude modulations of @xmath32 , where the amplitude modulation is defined as the sinusoidal amplitude divided by the peak flux , were detected at high significance , utilizing a @xmath31 search , in greater than 99% of our simulated datasets .",
    "@xcite report that x - ray spin modulations in magnetic cv systems are typically in the 4090% range , which would be clearly detected in our data .",
    "therefore if wd spin modulation is present in any of these systems , it is at a level of modulation far lower than seen in well - established magnetic wd systems .",
    "the sparsity of the pointed xrt data ( see table[ta : observations ] ) did not permit a search for modulations with long periods ( e.g. , periods on the order of days or months ) . as the bat light curves in figure[fi : batvar ] show , however , the hard x - ray emission ( 15 - 25  kev ) from all 4 symbiotic stars varied by a factor of 3 or more on a timescale of months .",
    "in addition , rt  cru  showed considerable variability in the xrt band on a timescale of days .",

    "november 2 , rt  cru  was detected at 0.35 counts  s@xmath6 , which was a factor of @xmath56 higher than the lowest flux level , on 2005 october 20 . the 0.310  kev flux from cd  @xmath157  3057  also varied over the course of",
    "the _ swift _  observations , but by at most a factor of 2 .",
    "also in contrast to rt  cru , the 0.310  kev flux from t  crb  varied by only a relatively modest factor of 1.4 ( maximum / minimum ) .",

    "nonetheless , the xrt spectrum appeared consistent with that found by _ suzaku _ in 2006 @xcite , in which the spectrum was dominated by a soft ( @xmath116  kev ) , relatively unabsorbed component , but also contained an additional hard ( @xmath117  kev ) , highly absorbed component ( @xmath118  @xmath30 ) .      to investigate the spectral variability of the sources with multiple observations (",
    "i.e. , rt  cru , t  crb , and cd  @xmath157  3057 ) , we used the xrt data to calculate hardness ratios as a function of time . for these hardness ratios , we selected the bands 0.34 kev and 410 kev .",
    "division of the xrt spectra at 4  kev gave an approximately equal number of photons in each band for rt  cru .",

    "although t  crb  also shows a suggestion of this same inverse relation , the relatively low dynamic range of x - ray brightness measured for this object leads to a correlation that is not statistically significant .",
    "the nature of the variations from rt  cru  and cd  @xmath157  3057  suggests that they could have been due to changes in the spectral shape of the soft portion of the x - ray spectrum , rather than changes in the overall normalization . to determine the nature of the observed hardness - brightness correlation , we divided the xrt data for rt  cruinto three brightness ranges and extracted spectra for each brightness . since the rt  cru  light curve at 810 kev was essentially constant , the most obvious way to generate changes in the spectra shape was variable absorption .",
    "we thus fit the spectra for the different brightness states simultaneously using the partial - covering model , with all the parameters fixed to the values from table[ta : pcfabs_model ] except for the partial - covering fraction , which we left as a free parameter .",
    "this procedure produced good fits for the spectra from each brightness state , with the fitted partial covering fractions values of @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and a 90% confidence lower limit of @xmath123 for the high , intermediate , and low brightness states respectively .",
    "figure[fi : rtcru_spec ] shows the spectra corresponding to the intermediate and high states .    the simplest way to explain the variations in rt  cru  is with a variable partial - covering fraction , perhaps due to clumpy absorbing material moving in and out of our line of sight .",
    "we suggest that such a process causes the brightness variations in rt  cru , cd  @xmath157  3057 , and possibly also in t  crb , although the significance of the spectral variability in the latter two sources makes it less clear , especially for t  crb .",
    "however , their spectral similarities , and the nature of their variability , strongly suggests that rt  cru , cd  @xmath157  3057 , and t  crbbelong to a subclass of highly absorbed , hard x - ray emitting symbiotic stars that do not show any evidence for a ch  cyg - like soft component .",
    "previous x - ray observations of wd symbiotic stars revealed primarily soft x - ray emission . utilizing the hard x - ray imaging capabilities of _ integral _  and the _ swift _  bat , a new class of hard x - ray emitting wd symbiotics has been identified , of which rt  cru , cd  @xmath157  3057 , t  crb  and ch  cyg  are members .",
    "the hard x - ray component appears to be predominantly thermal in origin , judging by the bremsstrahlung continuum shape ( bat ; this work ) and the presence of fe k lines .",
    "moreover , deeper observations reported elsewhere @xcite establish the presence of the k@xmath92 lines from h- and he - like fe , and our xrt data are consistent with the presence of these lines",
    ". the hard x - ray component of all 4 objects is strongly absorbed , and an absorber that only partially covers the source is required in all but t  crb .",
    "we do not detect any periodic variations .",
    "we did , however , detected strong aperiodic variability in rt  cru , cd  @xmath157  3057 , and perhaps t  crb , which spectral investigation showed to be caused predominantly by variability in the partial covering absorber .",
    "we can estimate the 15150 kev luminosities of these symbiotic stars from the bat fit results ( table[ta : batfits ] ) if the distances are known .",
    "for ch  cyg , we use the hipparcos - measured distance of 245 pc to infer a luminosity of @xmath124 ergss@xmath6 .",
    "note , however , that during the period of the bat survey observation the source brightness decreased to a hard x - ray low state seen by _ suzaku _ @xcite .",
    "the distance to t  crb  is estimated to be about 1 kpc based on its k magnitude , where interstellar extinction and the contribution from the accretion disk is less important than in the optical @xcite .",
    "based on this distance , the 15150 kev luminosity of t  crb  is @xmath125 ergss@xmath6 .    for the other two systems , the distances are highly uncertain .",
    "the inferred luminosities are @xmath126 ^ 2 $ ] ergss@xmath6and @xmath127 ^ 2 $ ] ergss@xmath6 , respectively , for cd  @xmath157  3057and rt  cru . given that cd  @xmath157  3057  and t  crb  have similar v magnitudes",
    ", 1 kpc is a reasonable guess for the former ( * ? ? ?",
    "* argue that the distance to cd  @xmath157  3057  is between 250pc and 1 kpc ) , although the accretion disk contributions and the interstellar extinctions may well be different for these two stars . @xcite",
    "suggest a distance of 1.52.0 kpc for rt  cru , which would mean that rt  cru  has an intrinsic luminosity 4 to 8 times brighter than cd  @xmath157  3057 , or greater if cd  @xmath157  3057  is closer than 1 kpc .    considering these luminosity estimates , and the thermal nature of the x - ray spectra , we believe that the hard x - rays in these symbiotic stars are due to accretion onto wds .",
    "the luminosity of such a component is proportional to the gravitational potential of the white dwarf ( g@xmath128 , where g is the newtonian constant of gravity , @xmath129 is the white dwarf mass , and @xmath130 its radius ) times the mass accretion rate .",
    "the highest temperature in the accreting plasma is also primarily controlled by g@xmath128 , although it also depends on the details of the accretion geometry .",
    "based on equation ( 5 ) of @xcite , these symbiotic stars could have large ( @xmath131 cm ) disks . although such large disks differ markedly from cv disks on au scales , on small scales where accretion energy is expected to be radiated as x - rays , the astrophysics is similar to that of cvs , and the physics of accretion is governed by the same fundamental laws .",
    "we therefore proceed by applying the knowledge gained from cvs to symbiotic stars .    on scales of @xmath132 cm",
    ", the magnetic field of the white dwarf can play a crucial role in shaping the x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "accretion in magnetic cvs proceeds vertically , forming a strong shock .",
    "accretion in non - magnetic cvs proceeds via a keplerian disk .",
    "the interface between the disk and the wd ( `` the boundary layer '' ) is thought to be the origin of the x - rays in non - magnetic cvs .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of non - magnetic cvs are generally in the range @xmath133@xmath134 ergss@xmath6  typically with kt@xmath5510 kev bremsstrahlung - like spectra @xcite . magnetic cvs are often harder and more x - ray luminous : @xcite derived luminosities in the range @xmath135@xmath136",
    "ergss@xmath6  for magnetic cvs detected by the _ rxte _ slew survey . the 4 wd symbiotics that we detected with bat appear to have luminosities that are comparable to , or slightly greater than , those of magnetic or non - magnetic cvs .",
    "the magnetic nature of a cv can be established by the detection of the spin period in the x - rays and/or the optical .",
    "that we did not find any coherent periodic variations in the _ swift _  xrt data , and that none have been reported in other data sets , is a strong indication against the magnetic nature of the accreting wds in these systems .",
    "that non - magnetic cvs are generally fainter and softer than magnetic cvs raises the question of why these symbiotic stars are luminous enough and hard enough to be detectable with _ integral _  and _ swift _  bat .",
    "we note that only one non - magnetic cv has been detected by _ integral _ : ss  cyg , which is the brightest non - magnetic cv in the 210 kev band @xcite .",
    "we argue that the high temperature and high luminosity of the 4 symbiotic stars are most readily explained by high values of g@xmath128 , i.e. , high mass white dwarfs . in the following , we estimate the masses of the wds in t  crb , cd  @xmath157  3057 , and rt  cru  by assuming that the plasma temperature in a boundary layer around a wd of a certain mass is related to the plasma temperature in a magnetic accretion column onto a wd of the same mass by one of two simple scale factors .",
    "we obtain empirical estimates of these scale factors by comparing the measured bremsstrahlung temperatures in ss cyg , a non - magnetic cv with an independently determined mass estimate , to the theoretical shock temperature for a magnetic cv of that mass . the vertical accretion in magnetic cvs allows plasma to reach a shock temperature of @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the shock temperature , @xmath139 the mass of a hydrogen atom , and @xmath140 the mean molecular weight ( we adopt 0.615 appropriate for solar abundance plasma ) .",
    "when one fits a single - temperature bremsstrahlung model , the resulting temperature is lower than @xmath138 because the emission is actually from a multi - temperature plasma cooling from @xmath138 to @xmath50 kev .",
    "nevertheless , single - temperature bremsstrahlung fits returns values in the @xmath24 1050 kev range for magnetic cvs ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a compilation of _ ginga _ results ) .",
    "the shock temperatures in non - magnetic cvs are lower than in magnetic cvs for two reasons .",
    "first , half of the gravitational potential energy has been radiated away by the accretion disk .",
    "second , the shocks in the boundary layer are oblique , and not as strong as those in magnetic cvs . unfortunately , the details of the accretion disk boundary layers are complex and theories are not yet sufficiently advanced to provide an unambiguous guidance .",
    "empirically , ss cyg has a bremsstrahlung temperature of 17 kev in quiescence and 7 kev in outburst @xcite associated with the transition of the boundary layer from optically thin to predominantly optically thick @xcite .",
    "its wd mass is thought to be @xmath141 m@xmath142 ( @xcite and references therein ) , and therefore its radius is 4900+/-700 km using the standard mass - radius relationship ( we have made use of the analytical formula of @xcite ) , and therefore @xmath143 kev .",
    "let us proceed , for now , by assuming that there is one scaling factor for the temperature obtained through a bremsstrahlung fit for low accretion rate ( quiescence ) boundary layer , and another for high accretion rate ( outburst ) boundary layer .",
    "these factors therefore are 17/71=0.24 for quiescence and 7/71=0.10 for outburst .",
    "t  crb  and cd  @xmath157  3057  have a bremsstrahlung temperature near 17 kev . using the scaling factors above",
    ", the inferred @xmath138 is 17/0.24=71 kev or 17/0.10=170 kev , depending on whether the boundary layer in these symbiotics resemble that of ss  cyg in quiescence or in outburst .",
    "these values imply the wd mass of 1.1 m@xmath142 or 1.35 m@xmath142 for these two cases , respectively .",
    "similarly , the 30 kev bremsstrahlung temperature of rt  cru  requires a 1.3 m@xmath142 or a 1.42 m@xmath142 wd .",
    "the wd in ch  cyg , with its much lower temperature , is presumably less massive .",
    "our estimate of the mass of the wd in t  crb  in the high accretion rate case ( 1.35 m@xmath142 ) is consistent with those based on the recurrence time scale of this recurrent nova ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . since the uv luminosity of t",
    "crb  is estimated by @xcite to be 40 l@xmath142 or @xmath144 ergss@xmath6 , with an inferred mass accretion rate of @xmath145 m@xmath142year@xmath6 , it indeed must be in the high state . as in ss  cyg in outburst and in the old nova v603  aql @xcite , the uv luminosity of t  crb  far exceeds its hard x - ray luminosity , probably because the bulk of the boundary layer is optically thick and predominantly emits in the uv and soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "given the intrinsic as well as interstellar absorption , the lack of detection of the soft x - ray component in t  crb  is not surprising .",
    "thus , scaling using ss  cyg in outburst leads to a solution that is consistent with previous studies of this recurrent nova system .",
    "all 4 systems show strong intrinsic absorption .",
    "in addition to the spectral results present here , @xcite report that a partial covering absorber model is required to describe the strong intrinsic absorption seen by asca in ch  cyg .",
    "the variability of the intrinsic absorption seen in rt  cru  and cd  @xmath157  3057  over relatively short time scales ( days ) would suggest that the absorbing material is associated with accretion onto the wd , and can not be explained by the mere presence of the m giant wind .",
    "assuming keplerian motion , a time scale of days corresponds to a distance from the wd on the order of 10@xmath146 cm .",
    "these quantities are much smaller than the orbital time scale of years , and the expected binary separation , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "10@xmath146 cm is a reasonable distance for a feature associated with the accretion disk .",
    "if the accretion disk is geometrically thin , we expect significant intrinsic absorption only in high inclination systems . for a thin disk ,",
    "there is nothing obvious that would prevent us from observing hard x - rays from low inclination symbiotic stars , with little intrinsic absorption ( absorption in the wind of the m giant is much less than is observed in our 4 targets ; @xcite ) .",
    "if the accretion disks in these high mass , high accretion rate , symbiotic stars are geometrically thick , it may be possible for the majority of the sight lines to pass through local absorbers .",
    "we note that in the models of stellar wind disruption by a compact object reported by @xcite , localized instabilities in the accretion flow can lead to absorption variability with timescales on the order of hours , consistent with timescales seen in our observations .",
    "however these models also predict a strong variability in absorption at the orbital period not seen in our data .",
    "as the orbital parameters of these systems are not well understood , comparison with such models is considered speculative .",
    "_ swift _  bat survey and pointed xrt observations have established ch  cyg , t  crb , rt  cru , and cd  @xmath157  3057  as bright hard x - ray symbiotic stars .",
    "we have put forth an interpretation in which the hard x - rays are produced by accretion onto a massive , non - magnetic wd . using a scaling factor from ss  cyg in outburst",
    ", we infer a wd mass of @xmath5 1.35 m@xmath142 for t  crb .",
    "the same conclusion has already been reached by other , independent means . a 1.35 m@xmath142 white dwarf ( @xmath130=2700 km )",
    "has a gravitational potential well that is @xmath1477 times deeper than that of a 0.6 m@xmath142 ( @xmath130=8800 km ) white dwarf .",
    "other things being equal , the x - ray luminosity and temperature of such a massive white dwarf are therefore @xmath148 higher than those of a typical ( 0.6 m@xmath142 ) accreting white dwarf .",
    "the high mass of the wd in t  crb  is thus the main reason that it is detected by _ swift",
    "if we then take the hard x - ray emission from t  crb , which is known to contain a high - mass wd , as validation of our method , we can also infer near chandrasekhar masses for the wds in cd  @xmath157  3057  and in rt  cru .",
    "if these mass and accretion rate estimates are confirmed , these symbiotic stars are also likely to be recurrent novae .",
    "moreover , given their near chandrasekhar masses , they may be valid candidate progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "higher sensitivity surveys are necessary to discover the full population of hard x - ray emitting wd symbiotics .",
    "if high absorption is universal , but the high temperature is not ( as suggested by ch  cyg ) , then a wide - area survey in the 210 kev band may be necessary . at the same time , t  crb - like sources may stand out easily in deeper surveys of the @xmath14710 kev sky , including the future versions of the _ swift _  bat all - sky survey .",
