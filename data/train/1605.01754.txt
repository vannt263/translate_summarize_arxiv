    "diffraction tomography ( dt ) is a popular imaging technique @xcite-@xcite applied to a variety of applications like medical imaging , non - destructive evaluation of materials , structural health monitoring , geophysics etc . @xcite-@xcite . in the domain of optical imaging",
    "this method has been explored in depth viz . optical diffraction tomography ( odt ) with multi - disciplinary applications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "dt is a broad imaging technique of which ultrasound and microwave tomographic imaging are sub - classes .",
    "it is a comprehensive way of characterizing the complex valued object - function of the test object .",
    "the scheme is applicable to microwave tomography of tissue samples .",
    "it has been of great interest in tomography of human breast to identify malignant tumours @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the high contrast between healthy and cancerous breast tissue provides opportunities for clearly identifying malignancies within breast tissue .",
    "the contrast is much higher than in case of x - rays and hence microwave tomography is advantageous both in terms of true detection and radiation damage from x - rays .",
    "further applications are in fields of sar imaging .",
    "various backprojection techniques have been explored for use in radar imaging and modified for better reconstructions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "faster implementations for backprojections algorithms are also being intensely explored e.g. @xcite . again , radar based methods have been combined with microwave tomography to generate higher resolutions for medical imaging @xcite .",
    "thus , any improvement in the traditional backpropagation techniques is of potential interest across multiple disciplines . in the presence of weak scatterers , assuming the born or rytov approximations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the fourier diffraction projection theorem ( fdp ) can be applied .",
    "the fdp relates the scattered field data from the region of interest ( roi ) due to incident plane waves to the 2d - fourier space of the roi , i.e. the test or sample object .",
    "using this image reconstruction is possible from collecting scattered field data from the roi .",
    "devaney developed the famous filtered backpropagation ( fbpp ) algorithm for this configuration which reconstructed a low - pass filtered image of the object function @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the traditional backpropagation technique requires projection data from @xmath3 $ ] angular coverage for accurate image reconstruction of a complex image . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite it was shown that using inherent redundancies in the projection data from the conventional setup , exact reconstructions were possible with data from @xmath4 $ ] coverage . in this paper",
    "we explore a technique such that the redundancies in the fourier space data from the conventional setup can be effectively used over any range between @xmath5 to @xmath6 to generate better reconstruction over regular backpropagation .",
    "this is a direct reconstruction method which does not employ any error minimization algorithms and hence is faster and accurate over angular coverages between @xmath7-@xmath1 .",
    "this is very crucial because the major challenge in many real world situations is that projection measurements can not be gathered over full @xmath0 view around the test object . with limited access to the object and decrease in angular coverage , the available data in the fourier space decreases .",
    "reconstruction from this partially known fourier space leads to many artifacts and loss of important image features .",
    "if standard fbpp algorithms are used for limited angular coverage , the reconstruction quickly deteriorates . hence alternate schemes are needed for image reconstruction from limited angular coverage projection data .",
    "this paper proposes to use projection datasets optimally to get better reconstructions from lower angular coverages .",
    "the idea was briefly proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a shorter version of this article is published in @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : section [ fdp ] gives a short background of the fdp and fbpp algorithms .",
    "section [ mincomp ] explains the minimal - scan complete dataset proposed in @xcite and how equivalent systems of backpropagation algorithms can be generated .",
    "section [ wtgen ] introduces methods to generate optimized classes of backpropagation algorithms which can give better reconstruction than regular fbpp in the angular coverage range where the redundancy can still be exploited , i.e. between @xmath7-@xmath1 .",
    "section [ result ] presents results from different backpropagation classes and analyses the relative performances at angular coverages below @xmath1 .",
    "the fundamental theory behind 2d - dt is the fdp which relates the scattered field data from the region of interest ( roi ) due to incident plane waves to the 2d - fourier space of the roi , i.e. the test or sample object @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the traditional 2d - configuration is shown in fig . [ 2dft ] .",
    "if the object @xmath8 is illuminated with a monochromatic plane wave of frequency @xmath9 incident at an angle @xmath10 to the horizontal axis , the 1d fourier transform ( ft ) of the scattered field measured along the straight line @xmath11 in the co - ordinate system @xmath12 gives the values of the 2d transform of the object @xmath13 along a semi - circular arc in the frequency domain tilted at angle @xmath10 as shown in the right half of fig .",
    "the scattered field data and the object function are related by the following equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents 1d ft of the scattered field under born approximation ( measured at line @xmath11 ) , and @xmath16 ranges between @xmath17 $ ] .",

    "consider the two semi - arcs oa and ob from fig-1 .",
    "the two arcs individually traverse the transform space ( i.e. the fourier space ) as the interrogating wave angle changes between @xmath3 $ ] . now consider their traversals in the fourier space individually for angular coverage of @xmath4 $ ] .",

    "physically this new coordinate system can be viewed as ` straightening ' the arcs @xmath32 from each projection and stacking them up on top of each other sequentially . in this layout ,",
    "the entire fourier dataspace can be divided into four sub - regions @xmath33 and @xmath34 as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath27 is a function of @xmath39 and so the regions have nonlinear boundaries .    from fdp theorem the following periodicity",
    "can be shown ( see @xcite ) : @xmath40 which also implies that for every point in region @xmath41 ( respectively @xmath42 ) , there is an point of identical value in region @xmath43 ( respectively @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , the knowledge of @xmath21 in regions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , makes information in @xmath43 and @xmath34 redundant .",
    "this redundancy can be handled by normalizing the dataspace appropriately using appropriate weight filters .",
    "the weighted dataset @xmath44 can be defined as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 satisfies the condition @xmath47 it should be noted that since region d is unavailable in a @xmath1 coverage we set @xmath48 in region d and correspondingly @xmath49 in region b. for regions a and c , any weight functions are valid as long as they satisfy ( [ wt1 ] ) . using the weighted dataset @xmath44 we can apply the regular backpropagation algorithm for reconstruction .",

    "further , for each class of weights , its distribution in frequency space of fig .",
    "[ rotate](d ) also determines the performance when the available coverage is below @xmath1 , because , @xmath43 and @xmath34 are complementary to regions @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "an efficient weight function set would be that which spans most of the regions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , thus limiting the requirement to access regions @xmath43 and @xmath34 . in effect",
    "such weights can generate good reconstructions even from angular coverages below @xmath1 .",
    "the next section explains a systematic approach to generate general classes of weight functions .",
    "from previous section , we see that the weights in regions @xmath42 and @xmath34 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively . notice that weights in region @xmath43 can be generated from weights of region @xmath41 , because for any point @xmath55 in region @xmath43 , the point @xmath56 is in @xmath41 , and then using ( [ wt1 ] ) , we get @xmath57 . thus it is sufficient to generate weights for the region @xmath41 only .    furthermore from ( [ wt1 ] ) , the non - negative weights are bounded above by 1 .",
    "so in region @xmath41 , for any fixed @xmath39 , the function @xmath58 is defined on @xmath59 $ ] , and takes values between @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "hence we propose a generalized approach by using cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) , which are guaranteed to be bounded within @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "though any cdf will serve this purpose , we would prefer to have cdf s with support in @xmath59 $ ] for any fixed @xmath60 $ ] , because that will ensure that weights are continuous at the boundary between regions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and consequently at the boundaries between regions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath43 and @xmath34 .",
    "weights which are discrete at the boundaries will generate artifacts in case of discrete datasets @xcite .    to this end , we use standard beta - cdf : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the standard beta probability density function ( see @xcite & @xcite ) : @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "[ betagraph ] can be used to understand how the weights will be distributed in regions @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "[ betawt ] gives useful insight towards choosing good parameters .",
    "for example , with combinations @xmath73 or @xmath74 , region @xmath41 is not well covered , whereas for @xmath75 , region @xmath41 has been almost fully covered with near unity weights leaving region @xmath43 with mostly near - zero weights .",
    "this combination is expected to better utilize data redundancy than the other combinations . especially for coverages lower than @xmath1",
    ", we receive less information from @xmath43 , hence an optimum weight function should span most of region @xmath41 with near unit weightage .",

    "fig [ betawt2_recon_eg ] shows the reconstructed real parts of the images by using these weights .",
    "reconstruction was performed from sub - minimal angular coverage of @xmath76 .",
    "the weights which cover region a more completely also give better reconstructions .",
    "since the weights are continuous across the boundaries of the regions , the transition from zero to unity should be prompt enough to retain as much information as possible within region @xmath41 but also not too abrupt to generate artifacts in case of discrete datasets . to estimate optimum parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 were parametrically sweeped and the corresponding weight distributions in the frequency space",

    "<S> filtered backpropagation ( fbpp ) is a well - known technique used for diffraction tomography ( dt ) . for accurate reconstruction of a complex image using fbpp , </S>",
    "<S> full @xmath0 angular coverage is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been shown that using some inherent redundancies in projection data in a tomographic setup , accurate reconstruction is still possible with @xmath1 coverage which is called the minimal - scan angle range . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by applying weighing functions ( or filters ) on projection data of the object to eliminate the redundancies and accurately reconstruct the image from this lower angular coverage . </S>",
    "<S> this paper demonstrates procedures to generate many general classes of these weighing filters . </S>",
    "<S> these are all equivalent at @xmath1 coverage but would perform differently at lower angular coverages and under presence of noise . </S>",
    "<S> this paper does a comparative analysis of different filters when angular coverage is lower than minimal - scan angle of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> simulation studies have been done to find optimum weight filters for sub - minimal angular coverage . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum weights can generate images comparable to a full @xmath0 coverage fbpp reconstruction . performance of these in presence of noise is also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> these algorithms are capable of reconstructing almost distortionless complex images even at angular coverages of @xmath2 .    </S>",
