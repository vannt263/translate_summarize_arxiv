    "neutrinos are produced abundantly from thermonuclear reactions taking place in the stellar core .",
    "they carry away most of the energy during the supernova explosion . due to the extreme weakness of its interaction it escapes its cradle almost intact and provides us with most reliable clues to the internal physical environments of a star .",
    "thus neutrino astronomy has been established as an important research field recently . the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite",
    "predicts the flux of the electron neutrino .",
    "the historic homestake experiment @xcite for detecting solar neutrinos revealed that the detected neutrinos fall far short of the ssm prediction .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed for the depletion of solar neutrinos .",
    "pontecorvo @xcite proposed the idea of neutrino flavor oscillation earlier than any unification theories @xcite .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an interesting review ) .",
    "the possibility of solar neutrino flux reduction by vacuum oscillation was investigated earlier @xcite .",
    "subsequent experiments @xcite revealed that the solar neutrino deficit depends on the energy of the neutrino .",
    "recently the idea of flavor oscillation combined with the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite has been most popular .",
    "the msw equations have been vigorously studied . for simple matter densities ,",
    "some authors @xcite derived accurate analytic solutions for the two - neutrino msw evolution equations .",
    "these solutions have been used for computing the neutrino survival probabilities with the approximation of the solar matter density by a mosaic of exponential functions .",
    "direct numerical analysis was carried out also @xcite .",
    "two - flavor msw solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle were fully analysed with high accuracy , including both the day / night effect and spectral information @xcite .",
    "recent super - kamiokande experiment @xcite shows an evidence for oscillations of the atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the data are in good agreement with two - flavor @xmath7 oscillations .",
    "these results did establish that neutrinos oscillate and possess non - zero masses .",
    "thus full three - flavor neutrino oscillation analysis is needed for more accurate estimation of neutrino masses and mixing anlges .",
    "even four neutrino solutions with the sterile neutrino have been suggested @xcite .    it has been argued @xcite that under certain conditions",
    "the solution of the solar neutrino evolution equation in the two neutrino case can be extended to the three neutrino case with a slight modification .",
    "there have been many analytic works on three - flavor msw solutions of the solar neutrino problem with simple linear and exponential matter densities @xcite .",
    "most three - flavor msw fits to the solar neutrino experiments have been made within the above framework @xcite .",
    "recently exact solutions to the three neutrino msw equations for such simple matter densities were derived @xcite .",
    "direct numerical analysis is always desirable but it has been hampered by the huge computational costs .",
    "recently we presented an efficient numerical algorithm for direct computation of the solar neutrino survival probability with all three active neutrinos @xcite .    according to the prem model @xcite , the earth consists of 10 layers of different matter densities and compositions .",
    "the prem model gives the matter density in each earth layer as a polynomial in radius .",
    "it is around @xmath8 mol/@xmath9 . in such matter densities",
    ", the msw effect can be significant for neutrinos with certain energies .",
    "the earth regeneration effect for solar neutrinos was numerically analysed by many people within the two - flavor framework @xcite .",
    "since numerical analysis takes a lot of computing time a few attempts to derive analytic formula were made . approximating the matter density in each of the five simplified earth layers as an even degree quartic polynonimal in radius , lisi and montanino @xcite derived analytic solutions for the two - neutrino msw equations",
    "other attempts were made for three neutrino msw equations with a periodic step - function density profile @xcite and with constant matter densities @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no direct numerical works on the earth regeneration effect with all three neutrinos to the depth as done in the two flavor case .",
    "in this paper we present an integrated algorithm for analyzing the earth regeneration effect of solar neutrinos with all three active neutrinos considered .",
    "integration of neutrino evolution equations can be done with any ordinary differential equation solver such as adaptive runge - kutta or bulirsch - stoer methods ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the wavefunction of a neutrino passing through the earth oscillates rapidly with large amplitudes in certain ranges of energy and mixing parameters .",
    "the crux of the problem is how to take time averages out of these wildly oscillating wavefunctions .",
    "two methods have been used in the two neutrino case .",
    "baltz and weneser @xcite carefully analyzed the oscillatory behavior of the survival probabilities and derived a formula that uses instantaneous values of the two particular wavefunctions . exploiting the symmetry of the transition probabilities ,",
    "smirnov @xcite derived a formula that uses only one transition probability , @xmath10 . due to economy of the smirnov s",
    "formula it has been widely used .",
    "however , we could not extend the formula to the three neutrino case .",
    "there is no shortcut in this case and we need to integrate the evolution equation for three different initial conditions , we realized .",
    "we introduce a method to obtain time averages of survival probabilities of solar neutrinos after passing through the earth in the three neutrino case .",
    "our method is numerical and thus quite general and can be used with any number of flavors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the basic formalism very briefly . in section 3",
    "we introduce our method for taking averages of neutrino fluxes as they pass through the earth core . in section 4",
    "we illustrate the complexity of the earth effect occurring at large mixing angles .",
    "we illustrate how it depends on neutrino energies , the mixing parameters , and the nadir angles . in section 5",
    "we present how to make long term averages such as daily averages in different seasons and monthly and yearly averages . in section 6",
    "we present sample contour plots for an interesting set of parameters .",
    "the state of a neutrino can be expressed either in the weak eigenstate basis @xmath11 or in the mass eigenstate basis @xmath12 .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath13 transforms the mass eigenstates into the weak eigenstates , @xmath14 the particle data group @xcite adopts the convention for the mixing matrix , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the three mixing angles @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 roughly measure mixing between mass eigenstates ( 1 - 2 ) , ( 2 - 3 ) , and ( 1 - 3 ) respectively .",
    "we have neglected the cp violating phase , which is irrelevant in this problem .",
    "it is convenient to express the state of a neutrino as a mixture of three active neutrinos in the weak eigenstate basis , @xmath21 the mass matrix is non - diagonal in the weak eigenstate basis .",
    "it is obtained from the diagonal mass matrix , @xmath22 the wavefunctions @xmath23 of a neutrino in a medium obey the evolution equations , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is added due to the interaction with the charged currents via the msw mechanism @xcite and @xmath26 ( mev / cm ) and @xmath27 .    in principle we can use the neutrino evolution equations in either of the two basis . in practice the mass eigenstate based equations require diagonalization of the mass matrix at each time step .",
    "diagonalization introduces non - trivial errors and takes extra computing time in addition to the time to solve the ordinary differential equations .",
    "thus we chose the weak eigenstate based evolution equations .",
    "let us make a quick check of the two neutrino resonant condition in the earth core where @xmath28 , @xmath29 while holding the other mixing angles equal to zero .",
    "one finds that for a small value of the ( 1 - 2 ) mixing angle ( @xmath30 ) , the ( 1 - 2 ) transition takes place for neutrinos with @xmath31 ev@xmath32 . for large values of @xmath1 , the resonant condition is satisfied for lower energy values",
    ". thus the low energy @xmath33-neutrinos can be susceptible to the earth matter .",
    "the electron neutrinos born from various sources within the solar core come out to the solar surface with average probabilities [ @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . in the interesting ranges of mixing parameters , @xmath37 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ,",
    "we have compiled a large set of solar neutrino survival probabilities born at selected radial positions @xmath38 with selected energies @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath40 ev@xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "integration of the neutrino evolution equations in the earth are carried out using the cern library @xcite routine ddeqbs , which is an implementation of the bulirsch - stoer algorithm .",
    "we used the prem model @xcite with @xmath43 in the core ( @xmath44 km ) and @xmath45 in the mantle .",
    "our results agree with previous works @xcite .",
    "we especially checked our results against those of @xcite and found good agreements .",
    "( see fig .",
    "it would be extremely time - consuming to trace all these neutrinos individually as they pass through the earth .",
    "instead we trace how three pure neutrinos , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 evolve as they pass through the earth for a given set of parameters , @xmath37 , @xmath49 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath50 .",
    "we compile the wavefunctions for selected values of the energy @xmath39 and the zenith angle @xmath51 .",
    "then we set up a handy interpolation function to be used for computing the neutrino fluxes arriving at various experiments in any given period of time .",
    "let us denote the states of pure neutrinos after passing through the earth as , @xmath52 then the state of a solar neutrino in a mixed state with probabilities , @xmath53 can be written as a linear sum of three pure states , @xmath54 where we assumed some phases for solar neutrinos while keeping the phase of the @xmath55 neutrino zero .",
    "let us denote the state of a solar neutrino arriving at the earth as , @xmath56 then the probability of a solar neutrino to emerge as an electron neutrino after passing though the earth is written as @xmath57   + [ a_\\mu\\beta_e a_\\tau^*\\gamma_e^ * + { \\rm c.c .",
    "} ]   + [ a_\\tau\\gamma_e a_e^*\\alpha_e^ * + { \\rm c.c . } ] .",

    "then we have @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 the cross terms cancel out upon time averaging .",
    "it is convenient to express the amplitudes @xmath66 in the weak eigenstate basis in terms of those in the mass eigenstate basis , @xmath67 , @xmath68 averaging over time , we obtain @xmath69 we solve this equation for @xmath70",
    ". then we can express @xmath71 in terms of @xmath70 .",
    "let us denote @xmath72 we notice that the phases of @xmath73 become irrelevant upon time - averaging .",

    "( see fig .",
    "our figures agree with the results as illustrated in fig .",
    "4 of @xcite in the range @xmath77 .",
    "our figures completely agree with the results obtained by using the time averaged @xmath78 in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "we consider the effects of non - zero @xmath2 on the electron neutrino survival probabilities of an electron neutrino created at the center of the sun as a function of @xmath3 in mev / ev@xmath41 .",
    "we illustrate two cases in figs .",
    "2 . in fig . 2a we consider the small mixing angle ( sma ) case using the set of parameter values , ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ev@xmath41 ) .",
    "it consists of 3 plots corresponding to @xmath82 .",
    "2b corresponds to the large mixing angle ( lma ) case and ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ev@xmath41 ) was used .",
    "the upper limit of solar neutrino energy , 20 mev is indicated by the downward arrow .",
    "each plot contains a curve for raw solar neutrino flux and five curves marked by sm corresponding to five neutrino paths with nadir angles @xmath85 .",
    "neutrinos undergo resonance conspicuously in those regions where the curves oscillate widely away from the raw curve .",
    "we notice that for nonzero values of the ( 1 - 3 ) mixing angle @xmath2 double resonances occur , one in the range @xmath86 and the other in @xmath87 .",
    "the resonance in the low range is caused by non - zero @xmath1 and its amplitude grows larger for large @xmath1 .",
    "the resonance in the high range is due to non - zero @xmath2 and it is enhanced for large @xmath2 .",
    "the resonances occur for all nadir angles with almost equal strengths .",
    "it is noteworthy that for low energy solar neutrinos the earth effect is larger for smaller values of the nadir angle .",
    "2a reveals that in the sma case the earth effect for low energy solar neutrinos ( @xmath88 mev ) is minor for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "2b exhibits that in the lma case the earth effect is non - trivial for some high energy @xmath4b and @xmath5 solar neutrinos .",
    "it is most significant for small values of @xmath2 and diminishes for large @xmath2 .",
    "since it costs a lot of computation to trace neutrinos for each nadir angle we need to make a strategy for handling the angular effect .",
    "we exploit that for a given set of parameters , the neutrino wavefunctions are smooth functions of the nadir angle @xmath51 .",
    "we thus compute at a finite number of angles and then build an interpolation function . for the nadir angle ,",
    "we choose @xmath89 as the sampling function .",
    "thus we sample more frequently near @xmath90 and scarcely near @xmath91 .",
    "we selected 25 nadir angles between 0 and @xmath92 . for low energy solar neutrinos the earth effect diminishes for @xmath93 , the nadir angle grazing the boundary between the core and the mantle .",
    "thus our sampling strategy works fine .",
    "an interpolation function made from these 25 @xmath51 values will be fairly accurate to use .",
    "we can now compute the states of pure neutrinos , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 at discrete energies and nadir angles selected according to the importance sampling functions . in our previous works on solar neutrino flux @xcite , we selected energy sampling points according to the convolution of the neutrino energy distribution functions as they are created in the solar core and the detector cross sections . in the present work we added 7 more energy sample points in the interval @xmath97 mev to account for the cno neutrinos more faithfully",
    "we have compiled a large amount of raw solar neutrino fluxes for a reasonably large area in the parameter space , @xmath98 for selected values of @xmath2 , using the method described in @xcite .",
    "our results were partially reported without the earth effect in @xcite .",
    "the results of our computations in the @xmath99 limit have been carefully checked against the results obtained with the analytic approximation formula such as the petcov s improved formula @xcite .",
    "we agree with their results in the range of creation positions where their results are reliable as they claimed , in the sense that their formula give the flux values averaged over the creation positions whereas ours give the fluxes created at exact positions as illustrated in fig .",
    "we also compared the survival probabilities of a neutrino created at the center of the sun in the range of @xmath100 for various sets of mixing parameters .",
    "the agreement is to one part in 1000 in the worst case .",
    "since our results are computed numerically we have equally accurate fluxes beyond their claimed range . for three neutrino cases , analytic formula for survival probabilities for simple densities",
    "have been derived only recently @xcite .",
    "we have already confirmed that our subroutines reproduce the same results as those given in @xcite .",
    "next we compute seasonal variations of daily averages .",
    "the nadir angle @xmath51 of a neutrino path can be written @xcite as a function of the date of year @xmath101 from the winter solstice , the time of day @xmath102 from the midnight and the lattitude @xmath103 as follows , @xmath104 where the sun declination is given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the earth inclination .",
    "we illustrate the survival probabilities for two interesting parameter sets in figs .",
    "the average was taken over every 12 minuites for 24 hours on three days , the winter solstice ( dotted ) , the vernal equinox ( dash - dotted ) and the summer solstice ( dashed ) .",
    "the raw solar neutrino flux is plotted with the solid curve .",
    "the lattitude of gran sasso was used .",
    "the downward arrows mark the point of @xmath107 mev , the upper bound of the solar neutrino energy .",
    "each set consists of 4 plots corresponding to @xmath108 . as we notice from fig .",
    "3a , in the small mixing angle case the electron neutrino survival probability is almost unaffected by the earth effect as in the two neutrino case , regardless of @xmath2 .",
    "3b shows that in the large mixing angle case ( we used @xmath109 , @xmath110 ev@xmath41 in fig .",
    "3b ) the earth effect is non - negligible for high energy neutrinos .",
    "the effect is maximal for @xmath111 and diminishes as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "we are now equipped with all the routines that are needed to compute average fluxes in an extended period of time . since we used the importance sampling method for selecting reasonably large number of creation positions and energies to set up an interpolation function that is particularly good in the important ranges",
    ", we can reproduce the fluxes with high accuracy for creation position and energy values within the those ranges .",
    "we have computed a large number of states of pure neutrinos , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 at 100 discrete energies and 25 nadir angles .",
    "we used 40 energy sample points for @xmath33 neutrinos in the interval @xmath112 mev similarly picked as in @xcite and the same 60 points as used in @xcite in the interval @xmath113 mev for boron and cno neutrinos , for the same set of parameters @xmath114 .",
    "we handpicked three important energy points , @xmath115 mev for be neutrinos and pep neutrinos repectively .",
    "each integration of the neutrino evolution equations in the earth takes only a modest amount of computing time but the huge number of integrations requires a large amount of total computing time .",
    "we again have to resort to a parallel supercomputer .",
    "the parallelization can be done using the same method as described in @xcite .    using these data we can compute the earth regeneration effect on the survival probability of an incident solar neutrino at any energy and any nadir angle for a selected set of mixing parameters . in this way",
    "we can compute the earth regenerated solar neutrino fluxes for a large region of the mixing parameter space with a modest number of energy samplings to yield an accurate estimate of event rates .    some cautions",
    "are needed for setting up an interpolation function for creation positions and energies .",
    "we illustrate the solar neutrino survival probability as a function of creation position in fig .",
    "4 , where we see a very sharply rising curve .",
    "we see a sharply dropping curve in fig .",
    "since we are using only a finite number of samples with different spacings we will encounter a sticky situation when the curves happen to turn sharply in the region where the sample spacing is wide .",
    "the popular cubic spline interpolation fails badly in this situation .",
    "one needs to use the exponential spline @xcite .",
    "we used the fitpack subroutines available in the gams library @xcite .",
    "4 shows the interpolated curve is as good as the original one .",
    "we illustrate sample iso - snu(flux ) contour plots in the plane , ( @xmath116 ) , for a set of mixing parameters , @xmath117 , @xmath40 ev@xmath41 , and @xmath42 in fig .",
    "5 . for a given set of ( @xmath118 )",
    "we had generated solar neutrinos according to the ssm model @xcite . in order to compute the raw solar neutrino fluxes we used 36 creation positions and 60 energy samples for @xmath33 neutrino and 60 creation positions and 60 + 7 energy samples for others .",
    "for the same set of mixing parameters ( @xmath119 ) we had computed the states of three pure neutrinos , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 at 100 discrete energies and 25 nadir angles",
    "optimally selected as explained in section iv .",
    "for each solar neutrino created at position @xmath38 with energy @xmath39 we perform a sequence of time averaging operations leading to eq .",
    "( 22 ) . in this way",
    "we build an interpolation function for @xmath120 as a function of creation position @xmath38 , energy @xmath39 and nadir angle @xmath51 .",
    "we integrate the fluxes over the creation positions according to the relevant creation probability distribution functions and then build an interpolation function for @xmath121 as a function of the energy and nadir angle .",
    "we can now take seasonal and yearly averages of this flux to get @xmath122 , which involves integration over @xmath51 with a definite lattitude @xmath103 .",
    "finally we take a convolution of @xmath122 with the absorption cross sections @xmath123 to get the yearly average of event rate for a particular experiment .    in order to make iso - snu(flux )",
    "contour plots , we used a @xmath124 logarithmic mesh in the ( @xmath116 ) plane in the range @xmath125 and @xmath126 ev@xmath41 .",
    "we padded two extra values , ( 0.85,0.97 ) , for @xmath127 in order to examine the large @xmath1 region more carefully .",
    "we made separate plots for each experiment @xcite with appropriate lattitude @xmath103 .",
    "as expected from previous figures , contours in the sma region are almost intact but those in the small @xmath128 ev@xmath41 and large @xmath129 region are distorted significantly by the earth effect .",
    "but for gallium detectors the curves are not distorted visibly in the considered region of parameter space .",
    "this is due to the fact that the major signal source for gallium detectors is the @xmath33 neutrinos with very low energies , for which the earth regeneration effect is minimal .",
    "the overall earth effect for solar neutrinos is larger for small @xmath2 than for large @xmath2 as we see from fig .",
    "we introduced an integrated algorithm to deal with the earth regeneration effect of solar neutrinos with all three active neutrinos considered .",
    "main ingredients of the algorithm are the time averaging algorithm with the use of mass eigenstates , the strategy for sampling energy and nadir angle , and the interpolation algorithm .",
    "our algorithm is useful for full scale investigation of the earth effect .",
    "we illustrated that the earth effect on low energy solar neutrinos causes large variations in the survival probabilities for large mixing angles @xmath1 at a given value of @xmath2 .",
    "but it is maximal for small values of @xmath2 and diminishes for large values ( @xmath130 ) at a given value of @xmath1 .",
    "the nadir angle dependence is sensitive to the value of @xmath100 . as far",
    "as low energy solar neutrinos are concerned we notice that the earth effect is more pronounced for smaller nadir angles .",
