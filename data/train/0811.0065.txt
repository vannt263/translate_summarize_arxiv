    "structural transitions in solids may be caused by various external parameters such as temperature , pressure , stress , electrical and magnetic fields @xciteetc .",
    "confinement and dimensional reduction can also lead to structural transitions especially in soft solids like colloidal suspensions .",
    "colloidal solids are especially suited to modification and manipulation using a variety of means such as structural confinement @xcite , laser - induced phase transitions @xcite , shear @xcite , static @xcite and dynamic @xcite external fields .",
    "confined colloids kept in a thin wedge geometry of two optically - flat quartz glass plates , exhibit a sequence of structural transitions : @xmath2 with increasing wedge height , where @xmath3 is the number of layers and @xmath4 and @xmath5 corresponds to layers of triangular(@xmath6 ) and square(@xmath7 ) symmetry respectively @xcite .",
    "the full equilibrium phase diagram of such a system has been studied analytically as well as using extensive computer simulations@xcite .",
    "the transitions are usually first order , though continuous transitions via a layer buckling mechanism @xcite has also been predicted and observed .    in this paper , we explore another way in which structural transitions may be induced in a colloidal solid . consider a crystalline bilayer separated by a distance @xmath1 between the layers .",
    "each of these layers is held in place by individual trapping potentials , set up , for example using laser tweezers @xcite .",
    "the strong trapping potential ensures that out of layer fluctuations are typically unimportant .",
    "we investigate the stability of the bilayer as the distance @xmath1 is decreased .",
    "we show that @xmath1 behaves as a controlling parameter and induces a rich sequence of transitions involving a variety of two - dimensional bravais lattices",
    ". the exact sequence of transitions crucially depends on the nature of interactions . in this paper",
    "we study two kinds of model solids ( a ) the generic lennard jones ( lj ) @xcite solid and ( b ) the soft gaussian core model ( gcm ) @xcite appropriate for suspensions of globular polymers .",
    "our main results are as follows . for the lj system , we obtain at temperature @xmath8 two independent triangular ( trn ) crystalline layers for large @xmath1 . as @xmath1 is reduced , the system undergoes a _ first order _ transition to a staggered square ( sqr ) solid .",
    "as @xmath1 is further reduced , this square solid becomes , first , a centered rectangular ( cr ) and finally again a triangular solid as @xmath1 is decreases to zero and the layers merge .",
    "the final two transitions are continuous .",
    "in contrast for the gcm , _ all _ the transitions are continuous .",
    "as @xmath1 reduces , the trn solid transforms to a sqr solid continuously through a sequences of rhombic ( rmb ) lattices .",
    "the sqr solid subsequently transforms back to the trn solid for small values of @xmath1 again continuously but this time it uses a sequence of cr lattices with intermediate aspect ratios .",
    "the progression of phases seen correspond roughly with those seen in the extensive literature on classical interacting bilayer wigner crystals @xcite , though the sequence of phases and the nature of transitions are different .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as below . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the bilayer system in detail , introducing the order parameters for the transition and state the interatomic potentials used . in section 3,we give the results for the zero temperature energy minimization .",
    "this is followed in section 4 by a full normal mode analysis investigating the stability of the ground states obtained in section 3 and the nature of the transition . in section 5 ,",
    "we present results of finite temperature monte carlo simulations .",
    "we discuss our results and their implications and conclude in section 6 .",

    ", width=113 ]    consider a system of @xmath12 particles arranged as two parallel two - dimesional crystalline layers of @xmath13 particles each ( see fig.([fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "the crystal structure of each of these layers may be assumed to be a general two - dimensional oblique ( @xmath14 ) lattice .",
    "each particle interacts with all other particles via isotropic and pair - wise interacting potentials .",
    "the position vector for the @xmath15-th particle of this lattice can thus be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two in - plane basis vectors , @xmath11 is the angle between these two basis vectors,@xmath1 is the interlayer separation and @xmath20 is a shift between the center of masses of two layers ( fig.([fig1 ] ) ) . therefore to specify our model completely , knowledge of these five variables , @xmath21 is sufficient .",
    "the last variable @xmath20 ensures that for small values of @xmath1 , the particles from different layers do not overlap .",
    "the particles are not allowed to fluctuate out of the layers and particle exchange between the layers is prohibited . each layer is therefore considered to be strongly confined in the z - direction while they are allowed complete freedom in the x , y- plane .",
    "let us first imagine the possible physical scenario as the layers are brought close to each other starting from a large inter - layer separation .",
    "when the layers are well apart they exist as two independent mono - layers and they show trn symmetry , the minimum energy configuration for the two - dimensional crystalline system for the interaction potentials considered by us . as the inter - layer separation , @xmath1 , between these two layers starts decreasing , the system passes through a series of structural transitions which may involve rmb and sqr phases . for even smaller values of @xmath1 , two layers start merging into one and the trn symmetry is regained . transformation between a srq and a trn phase",
    "may be accomplished , in general , by either ( i ) shear i.e. change in the angle between two in - plane basis vectors producing an intermediate rmb structure or ( ii ) change in the aspect ratio ( @xmath22 ) which produces a cr lattice .",
    "both the rmb and the cr lattices being less symmetric have trn and sqr phases as limiting cases .",
    "it is therefore clear that we need to introduce two order parameters @xcite in order to describe completely the phase transitions of our model system .",
    "first , the bond angle order parameter @xmath23 which is @xmath24 when system takes sqr symmetry ( @xmath25 ) and non - zero otherwise .",
    "the second order parameter @xmath26 is related to the aspect ratio @xmath22 as @xmath27 which varies from @xmath24 in the sqr to a non - zero value in the cr phase .",
    "note that the highly symmetric trn phase is described both by ( @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath29 ) . finally , if @xmath30 is the two dimensional strain tensor , the shear , @xmath31 , and deviatoric , @xmath32 , strains are related to @xmath33 and @xmath26 as , @xmath34    we have studied phase transitions in the bilayer system for two different model potentials .",

    "the gcm is interesting because , firstly , the potential is soft and is known to display behaviour similar to that of real polymeric solids .",
    "also many of its properties are well known and tested especially because at very low densities it reduces to the hard disk model which is widely used for modelling colloidal solids . due to the purely repulsive nature of this potential",
    ", it does not have any preferred nearest neighbour distance which is determined in this case by the density .",
    "this potential also possesses an interesting duality property @xcite such that high ( @xmath49 ) and low ( @xmath50 ) density properties are related to each other by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the dimensionality .",

    "the identity of the phases and the nature of the transitions depend on the interaction potential .",
    "on the other hand , some features of these transitions e.g. the overall topology of the phase diagram seems to be similar and independent of the details of the interaction .",
    "we believe that it may be easy to realize this soft matter system experimentally and study many of its interesting equilibrium and dynamic characteristics .",
    "for example , critical properties of the continuous structural transitions , especially , near the melting line and a detailed study of finite size scaling and crossover in these systems may be illuminating @xcite .",
