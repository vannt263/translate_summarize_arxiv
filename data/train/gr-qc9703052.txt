    "the developments in particle physics and cosmology suggest that scalar fields may have played an important role in the evolution of the early universe , for instance in primordial phase transitions , and that they may constitute part of the dark matter . moreover , scalar fields are an important ingredient in most of the particle physics models based on the unification of the fundamental forces , as for instance in superstring theories .",
    "scalar particles are needed in cosmological models based on inflation , whose relevance is supported by the results of the cobe - dmr measurements that are consistent with an harrison - zeldovich spectrum @xcite .    these facts , in particular inflation , motivated the study of the coupled einstein - scalar field equations to determine the time evolution and also the gravitational equilibrium configurations of scalar fields , which may form so - called boson stars @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the solutions of the einstein equations for a homogeneous isotropic friedmann - lematre universe with a real scalar field has been carried out in particular by belinsky et al .",
    "@xcite , piran and williams @xcite .",
    "the corresponding thorough investigation for a complex scalar field has been performed in ref.@xcite    the knowledge of the behavior of the background solution in the early universe is of importance for the analysis of the time evolution of the perturbations @xcite .",
    "this is of relevance if scalar fields make up part of the dark matter and form compact objects , such as boson stars , or trigger the formation of the observed large scale structures in the universe .    in this paper",
    "we study the time evolution of small perturbations in a gauge invariant way for a complex scalar field in the early zero curvature friedmann - lematre universe thus , generalizing the previous analysis for a real scalar field @xcite .",
    "we consider a potential with a positive mass and a quartic self - interaction term and closely follow the treatment developed by mukhanov et al .",
    "@xcite . during the inflationary phase the behavior of the perturbations is similar to the one of the real scalar field",
    "this is not surprising , since along the separatrices the phase of the complex scalar field remains constant and thus inflation is essentially driven by one component of the field @xcite .",
    "the short wavelength perturbations get smeared out , whereas the long wavelength perturbations increase . on the other hand ,",
    "the metric long wavelength perturbations are entirely determined by the scale factor and hence survive the decay of the complex scalar field background solution after inflation .",
    "we extend our investigation of the behavior of the perturbations also to the oscillatory phase , which takes place after inflation .",
    "contrary to the real scalar field for which the bosonic charge of the background solution vanishes , the charge is different from zero in our case .",
    "if it is sufficiently large , we can even find analytically the time evolution of the perturbations for a massive complex scalar field .",
    "it turns out , that the long wavelength perturbations decrease with time , whereas the short wavelength perturbations , at best , oscillate around a constant value .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the formation of gravitational seeds around which structure can form for the case of a massive complex scalar field with a sufficiently large bosonic charge .",
    "the other cases have to be treated numerically . in order to put constraints on the parameters of the scalar field potential from the measured cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies",
    "@xcite , we have to analyze the quantized perturbations . here , we have restricted the analysis only to the classical perturbations .",
    "moreover , we also derive the jeans wavenumber in the newtonian regime starting from the general relativistic equations , thus avoiding the so - called `` jeans swindle '' . for the case",

    "for all the other cases the solutions have to be found numerically .",
    "to complete our analysis , we study the evolution of the perturbations after inflation , which implies that the bosonic charge @xmath118 is close to zero .    as a first step",
    "we integrate the background equations from an initial singularity point @xmath221 , where the equation of state is given by @xmath222 ( stiff matter ) and the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath81 , @xmath223 and @xmath132 are as follows @xcite @xmath224~,\\ ] ] @xmath225~,\\ ] ] @xmath226 for @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 being integration constants .",
    "it should be noticed that the bosonic charge @xmath118 depends directly on the choice of the value of @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "hence , starting from @xmath221 we can freely fix the value of @xmath118 . in order to have a long inflationary phase we must choose a small value of @xmath118 , which is achieved for instance by setting @xmath230 and @xmath231 . with these values",
    "the background starts with a stiff matter regime and , after an inflationary phase ( @xmath232 exponentially increases , see fig .",
    "1 ) , ends in the oscillatory phase ( @xmath232 oscillates around a slowly decreasing curve , see fig .",
    "1 ) . for a massive complex scalar field inflation is also less effective when @xmath233 increases ( indeed , the maximum of @xmath232 decreases with @xmath233 , see fig .",
    "this , because the potential becomes less flat and as a consequence the slow - roll approximation , needed for inflation to occur , is no longer well satisfied .    as a next step",
    "we integrate numerically eq.([deij ] ) , eq.([dkg ] ) and its complex conjugate using the background solution .",
    "we control our numerical computation by looking if eqs.([de00])-([de0i ] ) propagate .",
    "moreover , we check if we recover the analytic solutions described in section [ section4:p3 ] .",
    "the bardeen potential @xmath65 behaves as predicted during inflation and remains , up to a smooth oscillation , constant after inflation .",
    "this behavior is valid for any value of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    for a long period during inflation @xmath234 decreases and",
    "thus , at first glance , does not behave as expected from our analytic analysis ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . for the cases @xmath235 and @xmath236 with @xmath237 we even get that during inflation @xmath234 is only decreasing . this may seem to be in contradiction with the analytic results obtained in section [ section4.1:p3 ] .",
    "however , this is not true since we do not start the integration of the background right away from the singularity point , where inflation occurs .",
    "if we did so , we would have obtained the expected analytic behavior for @xmath234 . the @xmath234 trajectory which we get by the analytic treatment , as given in table 1 ,",
    "should be interpreted as an `` attractor '' for solutions . indeed ,",
    "if inflation is powerful ( large e - fold number ) , the time at which the perturbation is generated becomes unimportant and @xmath234 will rapidly approach the behavior found analytically .",
    "for the cases where inflation is not so powerful ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the shape of the fluctuations of @xmath234 will depend more on the details of the background solution from which they were produced .",
    "that is exactly what we find in fig .",
    "3 . after inflation",
    "the long wavelength perturbations of @xmath234 oscillate .",
    "for an initial fluctuation @xmath113 , which lies inside the hubble radius , the exponential damping is so effective , that at the end of inflation @xmath113 practically vanishes , as can be seen in fig .",
    "5 . this is valid whatever the values of @xmath121 and @xmath120 are .",
    "we notice that , to check numerically the analytic behavior for the situation where @xmath204 , is more difficult , since one has to deal with numerical instabilities .",
    "in this paper we studied the perturbation of the coupled einstein - klein - gordon equations for a complex scalar field in different regimes .",
    "we derived analytically the time evolution of long and short wavelength perturbations during inflation .",
    "moreover , we established that in order to have a long period of inflation the bosonic charge must be close to zero .",
    "after inflation the perturbation of the metric remains constant during the oscillatory phase .",
    "if the complex scalar field has a large bosonic charge or the values of the parameters entering in the potential are such that the slow - roll approximation does not apply , then it turns out that inflation can not have taken place or lasted only for a short period .",
    "hence , the background passes directly in the oscillatory phase .",
    "we showed that in the massive case , for @xmath238 or @xmath204 , the perturbations of the scalar field decay or , at best , stay constant and thus no gravitational seeds , like boson stars , can form during this epoch .",
    "constraints on the parameters of the scalar field potential coming from the measured cmb anisotropies can only be put once a thorough study of the quantized perturbations will be done . however , since inflation is essentially driven by one component of the complex field , we do not expect significant differences to occur on the constraints and thus on the physical implications as compared to the real scalar field case @xcite .",
    "we also derived the jeans wavenumber for the newtonian regime starting from the general relativistic equations .",
