    "since the pioneering work of cavaliere & fusco - femiano ( 1976 ) , the @xmath0 model has been widely adopted in the fitting of the x - ray surface brightness profiles of galaxy clusters . in particular , despite the difference in the core radius there is a striking similarity between the x - ray surface brightness distribution predicted by the universal density profile as the underlying gravitational potential of a cluster and the conventional @xmath0 model ( makino , sasaki & suto 1998 ) .",
    "yet , it has been realized for many years that a single @xmath0 model is inaccurate and also not self - consistent .",
    "first , it fails to represent the central excess emission associated with the cooling flows seen in many clusters .",
    "second , the x - ray luminosity is divergent for @xmath4 so that an arbitrary cutoff radius should be introduced ( e.g. henry & henriksen 1986 ) .",
    "third , an increasing temperature with cluster radius is required for @xmath5 if the asymptotic baryon fraction of cluster at large radii should reach a universal value defined by the big bang nucleosynthesis ( wu & xue 2000 ) . finally , the well - known @xmath0 discrepancy ( e.g. bahcall & lubin 1994 ) may also arise from the employment of a single @xmath0 model . namely , the slope of gas radial profile described by a single @xmath0 model is systematically smaller than that required by the equipartition between specific kinetic energy in galaxies and that in gas .",
    "regardless of its simplification , the second @xmath0 model has been formally adopted by a number of authors in recent years to represent the excess x - ray emission in the central cores of cooling flow clusters ( e.g. ikebe et al . 1996 ; 1999",
    "; xu et al . 1998 ; mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 , mme hereafter ) .",
    "an immediate consequence of fitting the x - ray surface brightness profile with a double @xmath0 model instead of a single @xmath0 model is that the resultant @xmath0 parameters in the two components may both become larger . in particular",
    ", it seems that the @xmath0 parameter for the extended component can often be greater than @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that a double @xmath0 model may allow one to resolve all the above puzzles associated with a single @xmath0 model .",
    "moreover , in the conventional single @xmath0 model fit , some of the observed data points in the central regions of the cooling flow clusters should be omitted in order to obtain an acceptable fit ( e.g. jones & forman 1984 ) , while in some cases , the sizes of the excluded regions are not at all obvious .",
    "the introduction of a double @xmath0 model thus provides a way to quantitatively describe the central excess emission .",
    "in fact , as will be shown in this paper , our understanding of some properties of clusters such as the determinations of gas density and dynamical mass is closely connected to the issue as to whether or not the central narrow component is properly taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been increasing studies both theoretically and observationally on the possibility that intracluster gas is multiphase ( nulsen 1986 ; white & fabian 1995 ; gunn & thomas 1996 ; nagai , sulkanen & evrard 2000 ; buote 2000 , etc . ) , among which the detection of excess of low - energy photons in x - ray spectra relative to the average x - ray temperature in some clusters gives a convincing support to the presence of a cold gas component either concentrated in the central core or distributed over the entire cluster .",
    "a double @xmath0 model may correspond to the simplest case for multiphase medium , and therefore a detailed study of its properties will be helpful for our further investigation of the complex and multiphase intracluster gas .    in this paper , we present the gas distribution inferred from a double @xmath0 model ( section 2.1 ) and the total cluster mass under the assumption that the two - phase gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential of the cluster ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the difference in the cluster properties characterized by a single and double @xmath0 model using two strong cooling flow clusters , a2597 and a2390 ( section 3 ) .",
    "because the sharp peak in the central x - ray emission can be quantitatively described by the second @xmath0 model , we will be able to estimate more accurately the cluster mass enclosed within the central core and compare with that derived from strong gravitational lensing .",
    "we will examine whether the double @xmath0 model corrected x - ray mass can be reconciled with the strong lensing result ( e.g. wu & fang 1997 ) .",
    "finally , as a consequence of adopting a double @xmath0 model fit , the @xmath0 parameters in the two components may both become larger than the value in a single @xmath0 model fit .",
    "we will study the possibility of resolving the well - known @xmath0 discrepancy , using a sample of 33 clusters drawn from the recent work of mme . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "if we assume that the intracluster gas has two - phases with different electron temperatures @xmath10 , where and also hereafter the subscript number ( @xmath11 ) refers to the two - phases , the x - ray emission per unit volume in an energy band from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , according to thermal bremsstrahlung , is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is the electron number density , @xmath18 is the ion number density with atomic number @xmath19 and effective charges @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the guant factor of the free - free emission .",
    "we define the average electron weight @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total electron number density , so that @xmath26 in particular , if intracluster gas is assumed to have the cosmic primordial abundances of hydrogen and helium , then @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the primordial hydrogen mass fraction @xmath29 .",
    "suppose that the two - phase emission gives rise to , correspondingly , the two components in the observed x - ray surface brightness profile described by a double @xmath0 model : @xmath30 by inverting @xmath31 and comparing with eq.(1 ) , we have ( e.g. cowie , henriksen & mushotzky 1987 ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 eliminating @xmath22 in the above equations in terms of eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , we can get the electron number densities for the two components as well as the combined electron number density @xmath34 @xmath35^{1/2},\\ ] ] or @xmath36 and @xmath37^{1/2},\\ ] ] in which @xmath38 note that although eq.(11 ) can be formally written as @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] , which has been adopted in some recent work ( e.g. reiprich & bhringer 1999 ) , the determination of the central gas density for each component ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) described by a single @xmath0 model is dependent on both components of @xmath31 . in terms of eq.(7 ) , the central electron number density , @xmath42 , is related to the observationally fitted central surface brightness @xmath43 through @xmath44 in which @xmath45 where and also hereafter @xmath46 and @xmath47 . of course",
    ", one can also estimate @xmath42 using the total x - ray luminosity @xmath48 of the cluster ( eq.[1 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the case of isothermal gas distributions for the two - phase gas we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 apparently , the total x - ray luminosity can be estimated simply from @xmath51      the total mass in gas within a sphere of radius @xmath52 is @xmath53^{1/2 }            r^2dr,\\ ] ] if the x - ray emitting gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the underlying gravitational potential of the cluster , the total dynamical mass within @xmath52 is @xmath54 in which @xmath55 is the total particle number density for the @xmath56th - phase gas .",
    "if the abundances of hydrogen and helium for a single - phase gas are assumed to remain unchanged over the whole cluster , we have @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a proportionality coefficient . if the two - phases both have the cosmic mixed - abundances of hydrogen and helium , @xmath59 .",
    "next , we assume a polytropic equation of state for each single - phase gas , namely , @xmath60^{\\gamma_i-1}$ ] . in this case , eq.(19 ) can be written to be @xmath61 where @xmath62 . a straightforward computation using the electron number density found in the above subsection yields @xmath63 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the total cluster mass determined by assuming that the x - ray emission is from a single - phase medium described by a single @xmath0 model : @xmath65 it is easy to show that eq.(21 ) reduces to the form of eq.(22 ) if the two - phase gas components are assumed to be identical or the second component vanishes .",
    "we first choose a typical cooling flow cluster , a2579 , to demonstrate how a double @xmath0 model works .",
    "a2579 has been extensively studied by sarazin & mcnamara ( 1997 ) .",
    "they showed that the merged rosat hri and pspc surface brightness profile @xmath66 can not be fitted by a single @xmath0 model unless the data points within the central region of radius of 0.18 mpc are removed .",
    "meanwhile , the core radius has not been well constrained due to the presence of the centrally peaked x - ray emission , and the gas and total masses within the central region derived from the deconvolved gas density are apparently larger than those obtained from the best - fit single @xmath0 model .",
    "we now make an attempt to fit the same data set @xmath66 using a double @xmath0 model ( eq.[6 ] ) .",
    "fig.1 displays the observed and our best - fit x - ray surface brightness profiles of a2579 .",
    "it turns out that the goodness of the fit has been significantly improved when a double @xmath0 model is applied to the entire data points , yielding @xmath67 .",
    "recall that the minimum @xmath68 is @xmath69 for 29 d.o.f in a single @xmath0 model fitting ( sarazin & mcnamara 1997 ) .",
    "the best - fit values of the @xmath0 parameter and core radius for the narrow and extended components are @xmath70 mpc ) and @xmath71 mpc ) , respectively .",
    "note that our fitted @xmath0 parameter for the extended component is close to the value ( @xmath72 ) obtained by sarazin & mcnamara ( 1997 ) who have excluded the central cooling flow region .",
    "alternatively , the two components in our double @xmath0 model exhibit similar @xmath0 values . the same situation has been known for a1795 ( xu et al .",
    "1998 ) , while mme assumed the two components of a double @xmath0 model to have the same @xmath0 in their analysis of 45 nearby clusters .",
    "we have also tried the double @xmath0 fit by correcting the psf of the rosat hri with a fwhm of 4 arcseconds .",
    "this results in a slightly smaller core radius for the narrow component @xmath73 mpc ) , while the extended component remains almost unchanged .",
    "finally , we have compared in fig.1 the electron number density given by the deprojection technique with that calculated from our best - fit double @xmath0 model assuming @xmath74 kev and @xmath75 kev for the narrow and extended components , respectively .",
    "the agreement between the two results is good with @xmath76 for 32 d.o.f .",
    "although the very central point shows a deviation from the expectation of our double @xmath0 model .",
    "note that the temperature of the cluster , especially the outer cluster , is poorly constrained .",
    "our choice of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is simply based on the single temperature model fits by sarazin & mcnamara ( 1997 ) to the rosat pspc spectra of the core region ( @xmath79 mpc ) and the outer cluster ( @xmath80@xmath81 mpc ) , respectively .",
    "the reason why we choose a2390 for a further demonstration of the double @xmath0 model is as follows : first , a single @xmath0 model fails to fit the merged rosat hri and pspc surface brightness profile @xmath66 of the cluster , which has been well observed out to a radius of @xmath82 mpc ( bhringer et al .",
    "1998 ) ; second , the mass distribution of the cluster has been mapped with the weak lensing technique ( squires et al .",
    "it deserves to be examined whether the cluster mass derived from a double @xmath0 model can be reconciled with the weak lensing result .",
    "the latter is believed to provide a reliable mass estimate , independently of the cluster matter contents and their dynamical states .",
    "third , none of the suggested models in literature based on the fitting of @xmath83 have reproduced the mass profile given by the weak lensing analysis ( bhringer et al .",
    "in fig.2 we plot the x - ray surface brightness profile of a2390 observed from the rosat hri and pspc ( bhringer et al .",
    "1998 ) , along with a single and double @xmath0 model fitting .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath84 mpc ) for a single @xmath0 model with @xmath85 , and @xmath86 mpc ) and @xmath87 mpc ) for a double @xmath0 model with @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "indeed , a single @xmath0 model fit is not acceptable .",
    "bhringer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) obtained a good fit by introducing a gaussian peak plus a single @xmath0 model .",
    "our double @xmath0 model does provide a significantly reduced @xmath89 fit to the entire data points although the two components appear to be unusual in shape . because a2390 is located at moderate redshift ( @xmath90 ) , we may need to consider whether the core radius is overestimated in the above fitting due to the psf of the rosat hri .",
    "we repeat the double @xmath0 model fitting using a psf with a fwhm of 4 arcseconds .",
    "the best fit parameters become @xmath91 mpc ) and @xmath92 mpc ) . indeed , for the second component the core radius is apparently reduced , while the @xmath0 parameter remains roughly the same .",
    "now , we calculate the projected cluster mass within radius @xmath52 .",
    "the major uncertainty here is the x - ray temperatures for the two components of the double @xmath0 model .",
    "the presence of the cooling flow may lead to an underestimate of the overall temperature of the cluster .",
    "the reported temperature of the cluster in the literature ranges from the average value @xmath93 kev over the cluster ( rizza et al . 1998 ) to the cooling flow corrected value @xmath94 kev ( white 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , there is an apparent discrepancy between the rosat pspc and asca gis measured temperatures within the central region of the cluster . in the following we first adopt the two - temperature model of bhringer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which consists of a narrow , low - temperature component with @xmath77 and an extended , high - temperature one with @xmath78 .",
    "the projected cluster mass deriving from this double @xmath0 model based on the best - fit values of @xmath74 kev and @xmath95 kev by bhringer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is shown in fig.2 . while the shape of the resulting mass profile seems to be consistent with the weak lensing result , the double @xmath0 model with the above temperature data",
    "has significantly underestimated the cluster mass as compared with the weak lensing analysis .",
    "next , we treat the two temperatures @xmath77 and @xmath78 as free parameters and search for ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) that give rise to the best fit of the derived cluster mass from the double @xmath0 model to the weak lensing result .",
    "this yields @xmath96 kev and @xmath97 kev for the narrow and extended components , respectively , with a reduced @xmath68 value of @xmath98 .",
    "interestingly , these best - fit temperatures for the narrow and extended components are consistent with the reported value of @xmath99 kev in the central region of the cluster inside @xmath100 mpc ( bhringer et al . 1998 ) and the cooling flow corrected value @xmath94 kev ( white 2000 ) , respectively .",
    "we have also displayed in fig.2 the projected mass profiles derived from other two models for @xmath83 : ( 1)a single @xmath0 model and ( 2)a single @xmath0 model plus a gaussian peak .",
    "for these two models we use an isothermal plasma of @xmath101 kev , a value obtained from the asca spectra within a radius of @xmath102 mpc ( bhringer et al .",
    "the goodness of the fits of the resulting cluster masses to the weak lensing measurement reads @xmath103 and @xmath104 for models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively . in a similar way to the above analysis for the double @xmath0 model",
    ", we have performed the @xmath89 fits of the projected cluster masses given by models ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to the weak lensing determined mass profile by treating the temperature as a free parameter .",
    "it turns out that the best - fit values of temperature for the two models are @xmath105 kev with @xmath106 and @xmath107 kev with @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "these values are well within the rosat and asca spectral measurements .",
    "it is likely that the double @xmath0 model fit gives the smallest @xmath89 value , and thus provides the most precise description for the intracluster gas , although the current fit is still unsatisfactory .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that the measurement uncertainties in the fitting of @xmath83 and the spectral measurement of temperature have not been included in the final mass estimate of the cluster . in particular , using a double @xmath0 model instead of a single @xmath0 model will lead to a large uncertainty in the derived cluster mass since the central surface brightness , core radius and @xmath0 parameter in a double @xmath0 model fit can not be well constrained at present . finally , as compared with the single @xmath0 model ,",
    "the double @xmath0 model results in a significantly large cluster mass within small radii ( @xmath109 kpc ) , and the overall dark matter distribution clearly exhibits two distinct length scales .",
    "similar result has also been reported in previous studies ( e.g. ikebe et al .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the central mass excess as a result of the employment of the double @xmath0 model can resolve the mass discrepancy between the strong lensing and x - ray measurements ( wu & fang 1997 ) , despite the fact that our fitted core radius ( @xmath110 mpc ) is relatively small .",
    "our result agrees with the recent analysis by lewis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who found the x - ray mass within the arc radius is @xmath111 times smaller than the value reported by allen ( 1998 ) , @xmath112 .",
    "this indicates again that the previously claimed mass discrepancy between strong lensing and other methods has probably arisen from the oversimplification of lensing model for matter distribution in the central cores of the strong lensing clusters .",
    "in this section we discuss whether the well - known puzzle , the so - called @xmath0 discrepancy ( e.g. bahcall & lubin 1994 ) , may have also arisen from the employment of the conventional @xmath0 model for intracluster gas . briefly , if both galaxies and gas are the tracers of the depth and shape of a common gravitational potential of a cluster , we would expect the following identity ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ; bahcall & lubin 1994 ) @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the velocity dispersion of galaxies , and the number densities of galaxies and gas are denoted by @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively . for simplicity , we have assumed an isotropic and isothermal matter distribution for the cluster .",
    "the @xmath0 discrepancy arises from a statistical estimate of @xmath117 and @xmath1 , which turns out that on average @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) is larger than @xmath1 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "basically , two solutions to the puzzle have so far been suggested : either the galaxy profile in clusters may be less steeper than the simplified king model , or the present x - ray and optical observations have only probed some finite regions of clusters so that the asymptotic value of @xmath1 has not yet been reached ( gerbal , durret & lachize - rey 1994 ) .",
    "numerical studies of cluster formation and evolution ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; lewis et al .",
    "1999 ) have shown that the gas density profiles of clusters become steeper with radius and therefore , a larger @xmath0 value can be obtained if the fit to the observed x - ray surface brightness profile is extended to large radii",
    ". indeed , vikhlinin et al.(1999 ) have tried a single @xmath0 model fit to the gas distribution in the outer regions of clusters between 0.3 and 1 virial radius .",
    "they found that the typical @xmath0 values among the 39 clusters observed by rosat pspc would be larger by @xmath120 than that derived from the global fit .",
    "these results provide a useful clue to our reconsideration of the @xmath0 discrepancy because only the asymptotic @xmath0 value at large radii is of significance for the evaluation of @xmath1 . as has been pointed out in the above section",
    ", the @xmath0 parameters for the two components of a double @xmath0 model may both become larger than the value in a single @xmath0 model fit . replacing the @xmath0 in eq.(23 ) by the @xmath0 parameter of the extended component of a double @xmath0 model may give rise to a larger value of @xmath1 .",
    "hence , this opens a new possibility of reconciling @xmath117 with @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with the sample of 45 rosat pspc observed nearby clusters compiled recently by mme .",
    "we choose this sample because mme have already tried a double @xmath0 model fit to the 18 clusters of their sample , which can be used for the purpose of comparison , although their double @xmath0 model assumed the same @xmath0 parameter for the two components . in order to estimate @xmath117 , we exclude those clusters whose velocity dispersion and temperature are not observationally determined .",
    "this reduces the mme sample to 33 clusters ( see table 1 and table 2 ) .",
    "we reanalyze the archival rosat pspc imaging data of the 33 clusters following the same procedure of mme , who binned the x - ray surface brightness according to photon counts .",
    "we have also tried to measure @xmath121 using the concentric rings of equal width ( @xmath81 arcminute ) but found that the data points are too few for some clusters . to facilitate the double @xmath0 model fit to @xmath121",
    ", we will use the results of @xmath121 from mme .",
    "we fit the observed x - ray surface brightness of clusters to a double @xmath0 model described by eq.(6 ) .",
    "we employ the monte carlo simulations and the @xmath89-fit to obtain the best - fit parameters ( @xmath43 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) and estimate their error bars , in which we keep the same outer radii of the fitting regions as those defined by mme .",
    "essentially , the fitting can be classified as two types , and a typical example for each type is displayed in fig.3 . in the first case which is applied to 15 clusters in table 1 , the narrow component contributes mainly to the central x - ray emission and exhibits a sharp drop at large radii , while the extended component dominates the emission in the outer region . as for our example a2052 in fig.3",
    ", a single @xmath0 model fit gives @xmath124 but the minimum @xmath89 is 310.67 for 49 d.o.f . our double @xmath0 fit yields @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",
    "it appears that our best - fit @xmath0 parameter for the extended component is comparable to the one ( @xmath128 ) found by mme using a double @xmath0 model fit with the same @xmath0 parameter for the two components . in the second case , the central emission",
    "is similarly governed by the narrow component .",
    "however , the narrow component exhibits a flatter slope than the extended component does in the outer region . yet",
    ", the amplitude of the narrow component is significantly smaller than that of the extended component .",
    "we will thus take a less vigorous approach to the selection of the @xmath0 parameter : the value of the extended component will be used in our evaluation of @xmath1 below .",
    "mathematically , the fitted x - ray surface brightness profile will be eventually dominated by the narrow and shallower component at very large radii because of its smaller value of @xmath0 . for a1060 shown in fig.3",
    ", the minimum @xmath89 of @xmath129 in a single @xmath0 model fit for 113 d.o.f has been reduced to @xmath130 in our double @xmath0 model fit for 110 d.o.f .",
    "the best - fit @xmath0 parameter of the extended component is @xmath131 , in comparison with the mme result @xmath132 .",
    "the best - fit @xmath0 parameters by a double @xmath0 model for our cluster sample are listed in table 1 , together with the results for a single @xmath0 model fit , quoted errors are @xmath133 confidence limits .",
    "note that the @xmath0 values of the narrow components for about 1/3 of our clusters have not been well constrained .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that a single @xmath0 model fit is acceptable for some clusters such as a401 , a1367 , a1651 and a4059 .",
    "another reason comes from the sparse data points at small radii , which makes it difficult to place a robust constraint on the narrow component .",
    "0.2truein    0.2truein    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      the mean value of @xmath117 over 33 clusters in table 2 is @xmath134 , which is consistent with previous findings within uncertainty [ see wu , fang & xu ( 1998 ) for a summary ] .",
    "this value can be slightly raised to @xmath135 if a754 is excluded from the list .",
    "this cluster gives rise to the smallest value of @xmath117 because of its relatively small velocity dispersion or high temperature .",
    "similar effect was also noticed in previous work , i.e. , the mean value of @xmath117 can be biased high or low because of a few clusters in the sample . for instance ,",
    "bird , mushotzky & metzler ( 1995 ) found that their mean value of @xmath136 drops to 1.09 if a2052 is removed from their cluster list .",
    "using a large sample of 149 clusters , wu , fang & xu ( 1998 ) showed @xmath137 but the median value is only @xmath138 .",
    "the mean values of @xmath1 ( we will assume a simplified king model for galaxy number density profile ) from table 1 are @xmath139 and @xmath140 for a single and double @xmath0 fit , respectively . while the error bar is still large , the value of @xmath141 has been apparently increased in the case of a double @xmath0 model fit to @xmath121 . for comparison ,",
    "the mean value of @xmath1 in the mme sample is @xmath142 for a single @xmath0 model fit among 27 clusters , while @xmath143 for a double @xmath0 model fit for the rest 18 clusters .",
    "recall that their double @xmath0 model assumed the same @xmath0 parameter for the two components .",
    "our result of @xmath1 for a single @xmath0 model is in good agreement with the one found by mme .",
    "however , our double @xmath0 model fit yields a slightly larger mean value of @xmath1 , which is nevertheless consistent with the claim ( @xmath144 ) by bahcall & lubin ( 1994 ) ( note the different definition of @xmath1 ) , and in particular with the numerical result ( @xmath145 ) by navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "we now examine whether the observationally fitted parameter @xmath1 in the outer regions of clusters have any dependence on temperature or velocity dispersion .",
    "fig.4 shows the best - fit @xmath1 versus @xmath146 for our cluster sample .",
    "we fit the data points to an expression @xmath147 , and find @xmath148 and @xmath149 for a single and double @xmath0 model fit , respectively .",
    "we thus confirm the claim by vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that @xmath1 has a mild trend to increase with temperature , although we get somewhat a larger variation of @xmath1 from @xmath150 ( 0.48 ) for @xmath151 kev to @xmath152 ( 0.75 ) for @xmath153 kev in a double ( single ) model fit .",
    "we then study the distribution of @xmath154 for each cluster , aiming at examining whether the spectroscopic parameter @xmath117 correlates with the observationally fitted parameter @xmath1 from @xmath121 . to this end",
    ", we display in fig.5 @xmath117 against @xmath1 for our 33 clusters .",
    "indeed , there is a positive correlation between the two @xmath0 parameters . a @xmath89 fit excluding the data point of a754 yields @xmath155 , indicating that a high @xmath1 corresponds to a high @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , the above relation is also consistent with @xmath156 , although the mean values of @xmath117 and @xmath1 are on average smaller than unity ( see below ) .    finally",

    "the conventional @xmath0 model appears to be inaccurate , and the extrapolation of a single @xmath0 model to large radii could be misleading . the monotonic increase of baryon fraction with radius and the so - called @xmath0 discrepancy , together with the luminosity divergence as a result of the too small @xmath1 parameters ( @xmath159 ) for some clusters , may have a common origin : a single @xmath0 model fit to the entire regions of the x - ray surface brightness profiles of clusters yields an underestimate of @xmath1 parameter at large radii .",
    "the exclusion of the central data points or the employment of a double @xmath0 model in the fitting of the observed x - ray surface brightness profiles can lead to an apparent increase of @xmath1 at large radii , which may allow one to resolve all the puzzles mentioned above , although these two empirical methods both depend on the extent of the fitting regions . yet , in the conventional treatment the cooling flow regions are often excluded from the @xmath0 model fit , which may suffer from the uncertainty of different strategies of choice of the cutoff radii ( e.g. jones & forman 1984 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ; vikhlinin , forman & jones 1999 ) . as a result , the accuracy of our determination of the total cluster mass from x - ray measurements may be correspondingly affected .",
    "employing the second @xmath0 model to quantitatively describe the central excess x - ray emission can significantly improve the goodness of the fit , which thus enables us to derive more accurately the gas and total dynamical masses of clusters . in the present paper",
    ", we have extensively studied the properties of a double @xmath0 model , and demonstrated its applications using two examples : a2597 and a2390 . in particular , as compared with a single @xmath0 model , a double @xmath0 model via the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis for intracluster gas gives rise to a larger x - ray cluster mass at the central region , although this correction is still insufficient to resolve the discrepancy between the strong lensing and x - ray determined cluster masses enclosed within the arc radius ( e.g. wu et al .",
    "it is hoped that the mathematical treatments of a double @xmath0 model developed in the present paper will be useful for future work .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter as an indicator of the dynamical properties of clusters discussed in the present paper and the baryon fraction of clusters as an indicator of cosmological matter composition discussed in literature ( white et al .",
    "1993 ; david , jones & forman 1995 ; wu & xue 2000 and references therein ) concern mainly the asymptotic behavior of clusters at large radii , while a double @xmath0 model provides a more precise way to describe the variation of intracluster gas at large radii .",
    "we have thus studied the possibility of resolving the well - known @xmath0 discrepancy using a double model fit to the x - ray surface brightness of clusters .",
    "we have found , based a sample of 33 clusters drawn from a recent catalog of mme , that the spectroscopic parameter @xmath117 is on average consistent with the observationally fitted parameter @xmath1 from the x - ray surface brightness profile .",
    "of course , the definite resolution to the @xmath0 discrepancy also needs a better understanding of the distributions of cluster galaxies and their velocity dispersion at large radii ( bahcall & lubin 1994 ; girardi et al .",
    "1996 ) , for which we have assumed a simplified king model with a constant and isotropic velocity dispersion in the present paper . a shallower galaxy density profile ( e.g. @xmath160 )",
    "can give rise to a higher value of @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , the second x - ray core radius will become larger in a double @xmath0 model fit . in our cluster sample ,",
    "the mean core radii of the narrow and extended components are @xmath161 mpc and @xmath162 mpc , respectively .",
    "since the extended component is involved in the evaluation of @xmath1 , a good approximation of @xmath1 can only be achieved at very large radii .",
    "so , the effect of finite observational sizes may cause another uncertainty , and the extension of the fitting region will lead to an increase of @xmath1",
    ". as a whole , these two effects , the shallower galaxy density profile and the extension of the x - ray fitting region , can both result in a high @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the @xmath0 discrepancy still remains but @xmath163 .",
    "finally , within the framework of energy equipartition the ratio of kinetic energy in the galaxies to that in the gas should be close to unity .",
    "although our estimate of @xmath134 is still consistent with such a prediction within the error bars , this value , together with the consistent @xmath1 parameter @xmath140 , does not exclude the possibility that the actual value of @xmath164 is smaller than 1 , namely , @xmath165 . here",
    ", we will not intend to explore in detail the physical mechanisms for the scenario .",
    "however , we would like to point out that the dynamical friction would resist the motion of galaxies in clusters , leading to a velocity dispersion smaller than that expected from the purely dissipationless hypothesis ( e.g. carlberg & dubinski 1991 ; metzler & evrard 1994 ) .",
    "this may account for our result  why galaxies appear to be cooler than intracluster gas .",
    "we thank haiguang xu for useful discussion and help with the understanding of the rosat pspc data reduction , and an anonymous referee for many valuable suggestions and comments .",
