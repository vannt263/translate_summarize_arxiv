    "the hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams _ et al . _ 1996 ) has provided the deepest and clearest window to date on the extragalactic sky . from this dataset",
    ", groups have studied the morphologies of the faintest galaxies ( e.g. odewahn _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; abraham _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) and made photometric estimates of the redshift of these objects ( e.g. lanzetta , yahil & fernndez - soto 1996 ; brunner _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . here",
    "we combine these two independent analyses to generate morphological number - counts _ and _ morphological redshift distributions for a complete sample of objects from the hubble deep field ( 413 objects to @xmath5 ) .",
    "this represents a unique dataset which provides strong constraints on the many faint galaxy models which have been postulated to explain the phenomena of the faint blue excess ( see ellis 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "faint galaxy models fall into three broad generic categories : dwarf - dominated models ; pure luminosity evolution models ; and merger models .",
    "all of these various models can provide a fit to the observed faint galaxy number - counts and therefore these data alone are insufficient to distinguish between the proposed models .",
    "additional observational constraints are required and the most definitive one is that of the observed redshift distributions , n(z ) , for progressively fainter magnitude slices .",
    "for example , dwarf - dominated models ( driver _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; phillipps & driver 1995 ; babul & ferguson 1996 ) predict an additional low redshift component at faint magnitudes when compared to the n(z ) predictions of the zero - evolution models .",
    "conversely pure - luminosity evolution models ( e.g. metcalfe _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; campos & shanks 1997 ) predict a high redshift component whilst merger models lie somewhere in between ( e.g. carlberg 1992 ; rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 ) . in theory",
    "then , the problem is surmountable ; in practice obtaining a comprehensive and complete spectroscopic redshift distribution at faint magnitudes is beyond our technological capabilities .",
    "the very faint redshift surveys which do exist ( e.g. glazebrook _ et al . _ 1995a ; cowie _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) are relatively small samples and arguably susceptible to selection biases ( e.g. wavelength coverage , spectral features , surface brightness ) . for the moment",
    "the only recourse for establishing the n(z ) distribution at these faint magnitudes is to utilize distance estimates based on multi - band photometry , _",
    "i.e. _ photometric redshifts .    in  2",
    "we briefly discuss the adopted morphological and photometric hdf catalogs . in  3 , we compare the resulting galaxy number - count data and redshift distributions to zero- and passive- evolution models , and infer the generic form of evolution implied by the data .",
    " 4 summarises our findings .",
    "in recent years the high - resolution imaging provided by the wide field and planetary camera 2 on the _ hubble space telescope _ has opened up the new field of the morphological classification of faint galaxies .",
    "the initial work relied on the eyeball consensus of a number of experienced galaxy classifiers to sub - divide the faint galaxy population into ellipticals ( e / s0 ) , early - type spirals ( sabc ) and late - type spiral / irregulars ( sd / irr ) , e.g. driver , windhorst & griffiths ( 1995 ) ; driver _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) ; glazebrook _ et al . _",
    "( 1995b ) .",
    "the primary motivation to sub - divide into these three categories was based on the existence of observable structural distinctions between these broad groupings ( e.g. de vaucouleurs , exponential or asymmetric profiles for e / s0 , sabc or sd / irr respectively ) .",
    "in addition the e / s0 and sabc classes are also known to have distinct physical properties ( _ i.e. _ pressure or rotationally supported components ) .",
    "if these differing structural and physical properties are the result of independent evolutionary paths , then this provides justification for studying their number - density evolution independently .",
    "ultimately automated methods are required to construct statically representative samples in a fully reproducible and objective manner .",
    "this approach has generally taken two paths : artificial neural networks ( ann , see odewahn _",
    "_ 1996 ; naim _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) and decision trees based on structural parameters ( e.g. casertano _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; abraham _ et al .",
    "both techniques show promise , performing at a level close to that of eyeball classification but occasionally seen to fail when dealing with objects with overlapping isophotes .",
    "to overcome this potential bias we initially adopt the hdf catalog generated by the ann of odewahn _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) and compared it with the results from the eyeball classifications of one of us ( wjc ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting histogram distribution of @xmath12 t - types and can be approximated by a gaussian of mean @xmath13 and fwhm @xmath14 .",
    "however , the wings are non - gaussian suggesting that where there is disagreement it tends to be large and systematic . examining only those images for which the t - type differences are large",
    "show that it is routinely the ann which has failed and that the majority of these discrepancies are unambiguous cases of extreme irregularity , mergers or bright cores embedded in irregular halos .",
    "this is not surprising as there were few such objects in the anns original training set ( based on brighter galaxies in less deep fields c.f .",
    "1997 ) . to accommodate for this",
    "we constructed a final catalog in which the initial blind ann classifications were replaced by the eyeball classification if the t - type disagreement was greater than 4 t - types ( _ i.e. _ where the histogram in fig .",
    "1 becomes asymmetric ) .",
    "this resulted in 20% of the original ann hdf galaxy classifications being overridden .",
    "also shown on fig .",
    "1 is the @xmath12 t - type histogram for the faintest magnitude bin ( @xmath15 ) and we note that the distribution is similar to that of the entire sample , implying little or no degradation in classification accuracy with apparent magnitude .    the photometric redshift catalog ( described in more detail in fernndez - soto _",
    "1997 ) is based on that presented in lanzetta , yahil & fernndez - soto ( 1996 ) , but updated to take advantage of ground - based ir images of the hdf ( dickinson _ et al .",
    "the determination of the photometric redshifts are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function @xmath16 .",
    "the likelihood @xmath16 of obtaining measured fluxes @xmath17 with uncertainties @xmath18 given modeled fluxes @xmath19 for a given spectral type t at redshift @xmath20 , with a flux normalization @xmath21 over the seven filters ( @xmath22 ) is :    @xmath23 ^2 \\right\\}\\ ] ]    this formula is maximized for each of four possible spectral types for each object .",
    "this results in four redshift likelihood functions @xmath24 which are simultaneously maximized to give both the optimal redshift and the spectral classification .",
    "the four model templates ( @xmath19 ) were adopted from coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) and extended to the infrared wavelengths using the models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "intergalactic hi absorption was taken into account in the same way as described in lanzetta _",
    "details of the method and the reliability of the photometric redshifts are discussed in full in fernndez - soto _",
    "( 1997 ) . to summarize , the agreement between the photometric and the known spectroscopic redshifts is excellent in the low - redshift range ( @xmath25 ) , where the @xmath26 deviation is @xmath27 with no measurable bias in the residual distribution . at @xmath28",
    "some discordant values are seen ( less than 10% ) and we note that the redshifts tend to underestimate the real values in the range @xmath29 . no trend in @xmath12 z with t - type was seen . for objects where spectroscopic redshifts were available ,",
    "these were used instead of the photometric values .",
    "the final catalog is therefore based on 20% spectroscopic and 80% photometric redshifts , however we note that the agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are extremely good ( c.f .",
    "_ ) and the results are unchanged if purely photometric redshifts are used .",
    "the morphological and photometric redshift catalogs were merged by matching the x and y positions of the two catalogs . whilst the majority of objects were successfully matched a small fraction ( @xmath30% ) failed .",
    "these miscreants were traced to either positional discrepancies or due to differences in the deblending of complex structures , in these cases deference was once again given to the eyeballed classifications .",
    "the final matched catalog contains 401 objects with z s and morphologies to @xmath31 and a further 12 with morphologies only ( _ i.e. _ a reliable photometric redshift was not measured or not measurable ) .",
    "true colour representations of the full final catalog ordered according to morphology ( plate 1 ) and redshift ( plate 2 ) are shown .",
    "of particular interest in plate 2 is the trend towards higher irregularity and/or a higher merger rate beyond @xmath7 ( coincident with the peak in the star - formation rate as reported in madau _",
    "qualitatively at least this visually suggests a universe at @xmath10 dominated by a period of hierarchical merging of star - forming irregular galaxy clumps ( c.f .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the morphological number - counts and morphological redshift distributions respectively .",
    "the zero - evolution model predictions are shown as solid lines while the passive - evolution predictions are shown as broken lines .",
    "these models are based on the following : the local morphological luminosity distributions of marzke _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) ; the k- and evolutionary- corrections of poggianti ( 1997 ) ; a standard flat cosmology ( _ i.e. _ @xmath32 ) ; and a global renormalization ( @xmath33 ) of the local galaxy numbers based on an optimal count match at @xmath34 ( more detail on the modeling is given in driver _",
    "considering each population independently we note :     * e / s0s * : at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath35 ) , both the counts and the redshift distributions agree well with the predictions of the zero - evolution model , implying little net evolution ( see , e.g. driver _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 for discussion of the counteracting effects of luminosity and number evolution ) . at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath36 )",
    "there is a marginally significant ( @xmath37 ) shortfall in the counts compared to the models .",
    "this may be a statistical fluctuation or a pointer towards a net - negative evolutionary process or a higher dust content than allowed for in the models ( e.g. campos & shanks 1997 ) .",
    "if it is real , the shortfall may indicate a modest rate of continued formation of some extra ellipticals via mergers ( see e.g. summary in zeigler & bender 1997 ) .",
    "these conclusions from the counts appear to be in good agreement with those obtained from direct structural ( fundamental plane ) and spectroscopic ( stellar population ) studies of high redshift e / s0s ( kelson _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; barger _",
    "_ 1997 ; ellis _ et al .",
    "it is also worth noting the small spikes of e / s0s observed at z=3 at @xmath36 ; could these represent the end of the main formation epoch for early type galaxies or the presence of a large scale - structure ?",
    "* sabcs * : to @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ equivalent to the deepest sight - lines probed by non - hdf fields , ( driver _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , no evolution in luminosity or number is required . beyond this limit",
    "the zero - evolution model underpredicts the number - counts implying some form of net positive luminosity- or number - evolution . as the poggianti _",
    "_ passive evolution model slightly overpredicts the counts , one might perhaps conclude that the true picture simply lies between the zero- and passive- evolution models .",
    "however , it is very striking that in the redshift distribution at @xmath36 show an excess at @xmath39 followed by a sharp drop at @xmath10 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the passive evolution model and implies strong number - evolution .",
    "direct examination of the sabc images on plate 1 , suggests little evidence of merging or an overly high density of close companions , which would be expected if numbers were not conserved .       *",
    "the sd / irr / m+pec * : this class , effectively the catch all , is in disagreement with the models at all magnitudes .",
    "significant effort is therefore required to explain this population , which is identifiable as that responsible for the faint blue excess ( see e.g. ellis 1997 ) .",
    "surprisingly the redshift distribution of this population is very broad and has a higher mean over all magnitude intervals than the e / s0 and sabc population ( _ i.e. _ contains a more luminous population than giant ellipticals and spirals ) .",
    "the density of low redshift objects is roughly as expected from the models , _",
    "i.e. _ the true ( low luminosity ) irregulars are seen in the expected numbers for a passively evolving population of dwarfs .",
    "( recall that we use the marzke _",
    "_ s lf which is quite steep for sd / irrs ) .",
    "the excess irregulars are then predominantly at @xmath40 .",
    "the wide spread in the @xmath20 is reminiscent of the predictions for star - bursting dwarf - dominated models ( phillipps & driver 1995 ) , the `` dwarfs '' being able to reach high luminosities during their initial burst phase ( e.g. wyse 1985 ) .",
    "nevertheless , these objects may well also include the precursors of modern day spirals as well as `` genuine '' dwarfs ( for instance , it is easy to see that they could `` fill in '' the redshift distribution of the sabc class at @xmath10 ) . examination of plates 1 and 2 suggests that the objects classified as high-@xmath20 irregulars are frequently seen with close companions and/or tidal features indicative of merging , the implication is an epoch of merger induced star - formation occurring in the redshift interval @xmath41 .",
    "we have combined the morphological catalog of odewahn _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) with the photometric redshift catalog of lanzetta _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) for all objects in the hubble deep field to @xmath31 .",
    "this has resulted in a unique dataset from which we can construct the observed number - counts _ and _ redshift distributions for e / s0s , sabcs and sd / irrs down to @xmath31 . adopting the local morphological luminosity functions ( marzke _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) and with the caveat of _ a uniform overall renormalization at @xmath42 _ , we conclude the following :    ellipticals form over an extended period starting at @xmath3 , however the observed underdensity in the number - counts implies that young ellipticals are either masked by dust or only become recognizable morphologically as ellipticals after their stellar population has stabilized and aged ( _ i.e. _ a substantial population of young overly luminous ellipticals is not seen ) . from the observed absence of @xmath43 spirals at",
    "moderate to high redshifts ( @xmath44 ) we conclude that present - day disks are forming at @xmath6 via hierarchical merging . during this stage",
    "their morphologies are highly irregular , this is corroborated by the high number of irregulars seen at this epoch . at lower z the merger rate sharply declines and the more luminous ( massive ? ) objects crystallize into the regular spiral systems and evolve passively with minimal further merger events .",
    "meanwhile the remaining less luminous disk systems and merger by - products / remnants fade ( @xmath40 ) into the local dwarf and low surface brightness populations .    our final _ hubble deep field _",
