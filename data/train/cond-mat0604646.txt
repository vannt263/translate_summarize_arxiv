    "we will see how these structures of the internal field and the screening current appear both in the meissner state and in the mixed state by the paramagnetic effect , using the simulation of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory .",

    "therefore , near the surface at @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , the screening current @xmath79 is enhanced ( suppressed ) so that @xmath66 is suppressed ( enhanced ) compared with @xmath80 .",
    "this indicates that the field penetration is different between @xmath81 and @xmath82-directions.@xcite    in the closed system as in our case , due to the current conservation , the backflow current to the paramagnetic current flows toward the opposite @xmath83-direction far from the surface .",

    "the flow structure of the paramagnetic supercurrent at the vortex gives similar effects as in the situation when an external current is applied toward @xmath76 direction .",

    "when an applied field @xmath32 is parpendicular to @xmath5 , the broken - centrosymmetric spatial structures of the internal magnetic field and the screening current are induced by the characteristic paramagnetic effect due to the rashba interaction .",
