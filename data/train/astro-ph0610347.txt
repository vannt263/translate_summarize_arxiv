    "the existence of massive black holes at the center of accretion disks in agns is well accepted in current agn research . the so - called big blue bump , which is observed in the uv to optical wavelength region of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of many agns , is regarded as an evidence of the accretion disk ( e.g. , shields 1978 ; malkan & sargent 1982 ; czerny & elvis 1987 ) . based on another distinct feature of near - infrared bumps in their sed , the existence of a surrounding dust torus , which is heated to the sublimation temperature of dust by the accretion disk , is also accepted now ( e.g. , sanders et al .",
    "1989 ; barvainis 1987 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in practice ,",
    "however , it is known that composite seds constructed from a huge number of agns obtained by large surveys show their optical colors to be significantly redder than predicted by the standard accretion disk model ( see francis et al .",
    "1991 for the composite sed from the low - redshift bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) ; vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 for the composite sed from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ) .",
    "since agns are superimposed on host galaxies , how serious this discrepancy is depends on how reliably the nuclear sed has been separated from the sed of the galaxy component .",
    "in addition to the problem of sed decomposition , a possible contamination of near - infrared light from accretion disk and dust torus further complicates the interpretation of the sed .",
    "in fact , it is reported that the sed of the accretion disk extends to the near - infrared wavelength region ( kishimoto et al .",
    "2005 ; minezaki et al .",
    "2006 ) , and that the temperature gradient exists in the dust torus of which the inner part is hotter than the outer part ( e.g. barvainis 1987 ; glass 1992 ; alloin et al .",
    "these two factors cause similar effects such that variations at shorter near - infrared wavelengths are less delayed behind the optical variations , when compared to variations at longer near - infrared wavelengths . therefore ,",
    "unless the above factors are taken into account simultaneously in the analysis , the time delay of near - infrared variations behind the optical is liable to be underestimated .    in order to overcome such complications as well as the problem of sed decomposition",
    ", we propose a new method of analysing the variable seds of accretion disks and dust tori , based on a multiple regression technique . in section 2 , we describe the assumptions and methods of the analysis . in section 3",
    ", we apply the analysis to the long - term @xmath0 monitoring data of mcg+08 - 11 - 011 obtained by the magnum project ( yoshii 2002 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "2003 ; yoshii et al .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we describe the applicability of the analysis and discuss the results .",
    "let @xmath11 be the observed flux at wavelength @xmath12 and time @xmath13 , then it is decomposed as @xmath14 where the first two are the variable components from the accretion disk and dust torus , respectively , and the last component is a constant , partly offset including the contribution from the host galaxy .",
    "kobayashi et al . ( 1993 ) showed that all 14 qsos in their sample have almost the same blackbody spectra of 1500k .",
    "this indicates that the flux in the near - infrared wavelength region is mainly radiated from the innermost part of the dust torus , where the temperature is near the sublimation temperature of dust grains .",
    "hence , as we observe for each agn , the near - infrared light curves in different bands have almost the same shape and overlap each other by shifting the lag time between the variations in different bands ( e.g. , suganuma et al .",
    "when there is a short lag time of @xmath15 between variations in two near - infrared bands , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for example , which are intrinsic to the dust torus , the situation considered here corresponds to @xmath18 winkler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and winkler ( 1997 ) claimed that the optical colors of the variable component for seyfert galaxies remain constant as their brightness changes , while recent studies report that qsos get bluer as they get brighter ( e.g. , trevese & vagnetti 2002 ; giveon et al .",
    "for our analysis focusing on seyfert galaxies below , we then assume that the variable component synchronized with optical variation , which comes from the accretion disk , has constant optical @xmath19 to near - infrared @xmath5 and @xmath4 colors , i.e. , @xmath20 substitution of equations 2 and 3 in equation 1 therefore gives @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the constant parameters to be determined by the fit to the @xmath0 monitoring data , based on a multiple regression technique described below .      for calculation of the multiple regression , jefferys ( 1980 )",
    "provides the most generalized multivariate least - square process .",
    "this process allows errors to appear in all variables , which is desirable for astronomical observations . in practice",
    ", we adopted the mardquardt method described in jefferys ( 1981 ) , which is robust for the case that the initial trial for the fit is far from the true solution .",
    "the calculation of the regression with a given value of lag time @xmath15 requires interpolation of the monitoring data in time , because such data are usually discrete .",
    "we here adopt the linear interpolation scheme , and smaller weights are assigned to the data produced with large interpolation .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties of the interpolation , using the structure function ( sf ) of agn variabilities ( collier & peterson 2001 ; suganuma et al .",
    "2004 ) : @xmath26 ^ 2 - 2\\sigma^2 , \\ ] ] where the summation runs over all @xmath27-pairs , @xmath28 is the length of interpolation , @xmath29 is the number of pairs at @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the flux at time @xmath13 , and @xmath32 is the mean observational error for the data used for the sf calculation .",
    "we adopted a length nearer to the neighboring data point as the length of interpolation @xmath30 .",
    "while we naturally use the observational error as the weight for the data with no interpolation , we adopt the larger of the sf error or the observational error as representing the uncertainty of the interpolated data in the regression analysis . in order to determine whether or not the fit well represents the observations , the @xmath33-test is performed .",
    "the @xmath33-value is computed by doubling equation 8 of jefferys ( 1980 ) , and this doubled value follows the @xmath33 distribution of @xmath34 degrees of freedom , where @xmath35 is the number of data sets .",
    "finally , the value of lag time @xmath15 that gives the best fit is estimated at the peak of multiple correlation coefficient that measures the strength of association between the independent and dependent variables .",
    "the @xmath36 monitoring data for mcg+08 - 11 - 011 were obtained by the magnum project in the period from 8 september 2001 to 31 december 2002 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "aperture photometry was used throughout .",
    "an aperture size of 8.3 arcsec was adopted for all images .",
    "the flux of mcg+08 - 11 - 011 was measured relative to a reference star ( @xmath37 ) whose flux was absolutely calibrated using landolt standard stars ( landolt 1992 ) in @xmath38 and hunt standard stars ( hunt et al .",
    "1997 ) in @xmath9 during the monitoring observations .",
    "the host galaxy flux was estimated using the galfit program ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ) and was subtracted from the measured flux of mcg+08 - 11 - 011 .",
    "the estimated magnitudes of the host galaxy were 16.5 mag at @xmath39 , 15.5 mag at @xmath8 , 12.0 mag at @xmath5 and 11.5 mag at @xmath4 .",
    "a small error of 0.003 mag caused by the seeing effect , arising from the profile difference between the agn and the reference star , was taken into account .",
    "galactic extinction was corrected according to schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we performed the regression analysis comparing the observed @xmath5-band light curve with the predicted @xmath5-band light curve in equation 4 .",
    "we adopted only the data set where observations in @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 were carried out on the same night in order to decrease the effect of interpolation .",
    "the parameters used for sf@xmath40 were @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath8 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44=2.0 for @xmath4 . zero - correlation was assumed between the data in any two bands , and the standard error was used for the error of the fitted parameters .",
    "we carried out the regression analysis for a range of @xmath15 from @xmath45 to 60 days .",
    "the value of the multiple correlation coefficient was calculated as a function of @xmath15 , and its peak was found to occur at @xmath46 days with the @xmath33-value of 12.5 for @xmath47 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the reduced chi - square value becomes @xmath48 0.5 , which indicates that the fit is good enough to represent the observations .",
    "the regression at @xmath46 days yielded that the @xmath1-color temperature for the dust component is 1635@xmath4920k , and the index of power - law sed for the accretion disk component ( @xmath7 ) is @xmath50 from @xmath8 to @xmath5 and @xmath51 from @xmath8 to @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath1-color temperature of 1635k here derived for mcg+08 - 11 - 011 agrees well with the sublimation temperature of @xmath52k for graphite / silicate grains ( salpeter 1977 ; huffman 1977 ) .",
    "hence , this component represents the innermost part of the dust torus heated to the sublimation temperature by the accretion disk .    following winkler et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we performed the flux variation gradient ( fvg ) analysis for the @xmath38 monitoring data ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we converted the fvg @xmath53-color to the index of the power - law sed and obtained @xmath54=+0.21@xmath490.10 . combining this and the results in section 3 from the regression analysis",
    ", we found that the power - law sed with @xmath55 prevails in the optical to near - infrared wavelength region ( figure 4 ) .    for comparison , we computed theoretical colors of the standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) with a black hole mass of @xmath56 and an outer disk radius of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath54 as a function of frequency @xmath59 for two cases of accretion rate @xmath60yr@xmath61 ( upper thick line ) and @xmath62yr@xmath61 ( lower thick line ) .",
    "these predicted seds have an approximate value of @xmath63 , and agree with our finding of @xmath55 for mcg+08 - 11 - 011 .",
    "the standard disk model has a critical difficulty for explaining the variability .",
    "although many uv / optical monitoring observations have so far been made , all of them have failed to detect significant lags between uv and optical variations , except for ngc7469 ( peterson et al .",
    "1998 ; wanders et al . 1997 ; collier et al . 1998 ) and ark564 ( collier et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the expected lag time is too short for the energy to flow at sound speed within the standard viscous disk .",
    "however , such a lag time is sufficient for the incident radiation to transfer the energy to any distant parts of the disk ( krolik et al .",
    "hence , the irradiated accretion disk model has been invoked , where the central x - ray energy source illuminates a geometrically thin disk , and uv / optical light is radiated at the outer part of the disk .",
    "the predicted spectrum of the irradiated standard disk model has an index of @xmath63 at the radii where the height of the x - ray source is negligible compared to the radial distance from the center .",
    "this spectrum is exactly the same as that of the standard viscous disk model .",
    "furthermore , the detected wavelength - dependent lag time agrees with @xmath64 in the uv to optical region for ngc7469 and ark564 , which is the same as the prediction for the irradiated standard disk model ( collier et al . 1998 ; collier et al . 2001 ) .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the power - law sed obtained by our analysis reinforces evidence that irradiated standard disks exist in the center of agns .",
    "our analysis showed that the power - law sed extends to the near - infrared wavelength region . by the standard accretion disk model , the near - infrared @xmath4-emitting region in the disk",
    "is located at a radial distance of @xmath65 , from the center of typical seyfert galaxies , which is close to the inner part of the broad line region ( blr ) where high - ionization lines originate .",
    "collin & hure ( 2001 ) showed that the disk would become gravitationally unstable at @xmath66 .",
    "based on this estimation , the @xmath4-emitting region in the disk could be gravitationally stable , and the existence of such a stable extended disk could distort the kepler motion of blr gas clouds .",
    "this may explain the significant scatter of observed virial relationships of the broad - emission lines , in accord with the suggestion of peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the possible existence of some additional components may affect the blr gas motion .",
    "thus , near - infrared observations of agns bring information of physical coupling between the extended disk and the blr .",
    "particularly , in the case of agns with high eddington ratio , the @xmath4-emitting region in the disk would be further away from the centers of agns , and the outer disk edges might be observable ( collin et al . 2002 ; kawaguchi 2003 ; kawaguchi et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the accretion disk component contributes to the near - infrared flux by 15 - 30% in the @xmath5 band and by 15 - 25% in the @xmath4 band ( figure 5 ) .",
    "since the observational errors are of order 1% only , these disk contributions are significant , and can not be ignored in deriving accurate and reliable results from near - infrared observations of agns . for a long time , however , separation of accretion disk components in the near - infrared region has been considered difficult , because the thermal emission from the dust torus component is the dominant source there . in this context , the multiple regression analysis for multicolor monitoring observations is indeed a promising method for extracting the accretion disk component from near - infrared data , and will be useful for investigating the physical conditions and emission mechanisms of both components of accretion disk and dust torus simultaneously .",
    "we thank b. a. peterson for helpful discussions .",
