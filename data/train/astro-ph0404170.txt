    "this paper is about the motion of free test particles in the background gravitational field of a kerr black hole .",
    "the geodesics of kerr spacetime are well known and have been extensively studied in standard systems of coordinates such as the boyer - lindquist coordinate system .",
    "the boyer - lindquist coordinates are adapted to the stationary and axisymmetric nature of the source and are minkowskian ( expressed in spherical polar coordinates ) infinitely far from the black hole .",
    "we are interested however in the _ relative _ motion of free nearby particles ; as explained in detail in  @xcite , from the standpoint of relativity theory the study of relative motion is certainly preferred , since it is in keeping with the spirit of the theory . moreover , relative motion has direct observational significance .",
    "thus theoretical results obtained in the study of relative motion can be directly compared with suitable experimental data  @xcite .",
    "to study the relative motion of free particles , we need a reference particle whose motion is well known . for the purposes of the present work , we select the free motion of particles on radial escape trajectories along the rotation axis of the kerr black hole . thus at a given initial position along a radial direction in schwarzschild spacetime or the rotation axis in kerr spacetime , the reference particle has an escape velocity such that the particle eventually reaches infinity with zero kinetic energy .",
    "we then study the relative motion of the relativistic particles that start from the same location as the reference particle and travel in different directions .",
    "the origin of these relativistic particles on the axis of rotation will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "we will simply assume that such particles exist near the poles of the kerr black hole .",
    "the nature of the central engine and the details of the accretion phenomena that could generate such relativistic particles are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead , we concentrate on the gravitational dynamics of these particles relative to the reference particle",
    ". moreover , it turns out that the existence of event horizons has no bearing on our main results ; therefore , our treatment applies equally well to test particles in the exterior of a gravitational source whose field is adequately described by the exterior kerr spacetime .",
    "however , our results are in general observationally significant only in the case of highly collapsed gravitational sources such as neutron stars and black holes .    to characterize the relative motion , we establish a quasi - inertial coordinate system along the worldline of the reference particle .",
    "this fermi normal coordinate system  @xcite is valid in a cylindrical region of radius @xmath0 along the worldline of the reference particle .",
    "here @xmath0 is the radius of curvature of the spacetime manifold .",
    "the geodesic equations of motion for the free particles are then integrated in this fermi coordinate system subject to the limitation that the relative distance must remain well within the admissible range of fermi coordinates .",
    "the results of such an investigation of the relative motion of free particles would naturally depend on the choice of the reference particle .",
    "for instance , a separate investigation would be necessary if the reference trajectory is an orbit in the equatorial plane of the kerr black hole .",
    "in fact , a judicious choice of the reference particle would be essential to explain a particular observational result .",
    "moreover the relative distance in our approach should be less than @xmath0 .",
    "we find that ultrarelativistic flows in the gravitational field of collapsed configurations can exhibit purely non - newtonian behavior due to general relativistic tidal effects .",
    "these include the phenomenon of the tidal deceleration along the axis of rotation and the phenomenon of tidal acceleration perpendicular to the axis of rotation , which follow from the integration of the generalized jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "we study this equation and its extension in this paper and compare our results with the corresponding nonrelativistic tidal effects . in the following we use units such that @xmath1 .",
    "the signature of the spacetime metric is assumed to be @xmath2 .",
    "imagine a geodesic worldline in the gravitational field of an external source .",
    "let @xmath3 be the four - velocity vector of this _ reference _ geodesic and @xmath4 be its proper time .",
    "a neighboring geodesic with an arbitrary velocity relative to the reference geodesic is connected to it by the deviation vector @xmath5 such that @xmath6 .",
    "the generalized jacobi equation @xcite is given by the geodesic deviation equation to first order in @xmath7 , namely , @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the covariant derivative of @xmath7 along the reference worldline .",
    "let @xmath10 be an orthonormal tetrad frame that is parallel propagated along the reference trajectory such that @xmath11 .",
    "then , @xmath12 and equation may be written in terms of fermi coordinates @xmath13 , where @xmath14 along the reference geodesic , as @xcite @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 along the reference geodesic and @xmath18 is the projection of the riemann curvature tensor on the orthonormal tetrad of the reference observer along its worldline . if the relative velocity is much smaller than the speed of light , @xmath19 , the velocity - dependent terms in and may be neglected and the generalized jacobi equation reduces to the standard jacobi equation that expresses the linear evolution of the deviation between two neighboring geodesics that have negligible relative motion .",
    "this relative motion generally evolves slowly on the scale of the radius of curvature @xmath0 , which is defined such that @xmath20 is the supremum of @xmath21 ; therefore , @xmath22 in , since higher - order terms in the deviation equation have been neglected . in the generalized jacobi equation",
    ", the relative velocity could approach the speed of light ; therefore , the relative motion could evolve rapidly thus further restricting the temporal domain of validity of equation .    equation   can be derived in a straightforward manner using the reduced geodesic equation in fermi coordinates .",
    "that is , starting from the geodesic equation for a free particle in arbitrary coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , one can simply derive the reduced geodesic equation  @xcite @xmath26 specializing this equation now to the fermi coordinates established along the reference trajectory , i.e. @xmath27 , and using @xmath28 one arrives at the tidal equation for the _ relative _ motion , since in these coordinates the reference particle remains fixed at @xmath29 . restricting our attention to the terms given explicitly in   and thus neglecting higher - order terms of the metric in the spatial fermi coordinates",
    ", the tidal equation reduces to the generalized jacobi equation  .",
    "we study the main physical consequences of this equation in the field of a kerr black hole ( see also  [ appen : a ] ) .",
    "higher - order tidal accelerations are discussed in  [ appen : b ] .",
    "tidal deceleration along the rotation axis is discussed in the next section .",
    "the non - newtonian character of our results is emphasized in section  [ s3 ] .",
    "the analysis of the generalized jacobi equation is extended to the three - dimensional case in section  [ s5 ] .",
    "tidal acceleration normal to the rotation axis is discussed in section  [ s6 ] .",
    "finally , section  [ s7 ] contains a brief discussion of our results .",
    "imagine a kerr source of mass @xmath30 and angular momentum @xmath31 at the origin of an asymptotically inertial coordinate system @xmath32 .",
    "here @xmath33 is the specific angular momentum of the source .",
    "the metric of kerr spacetime can be written in boyer - lindquist coordinates as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "asymptotically ( @xmath37 ) , the spherical polar coordinates @xmath38 are related to the cartesian coordinates @xmath39 in the standard manner . in this paper , we are interested in the motion of free test particles in the stationary and axisymmetric exterior kerr spacetime .",
    "let us first consider geodesic motion along the axis of rotation of the source , i.e. the @xmath40-axis . in terms of the boyer - lindquist temporal coordinate @xmath41 and radial coordinate @xmath42 , the motion of a free test particle along the rotation axis is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the proper time along the path and @xmath45 is a constant of integration . for @xmath46 , the test particle can not escape the gravitational attraction of the source . when the test particle can escape to infinity ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 is its lorentz factor at spatial infinity . in the limiting case of @xmath49 ,",
    "the test particle approaches infinity with zero speed .",
    "we assume in the following that there are many such outward moving test particles with @xmath50 in the neighborhood of the rotation axis of the kerr source forming an ambient medium around the rotating source .",
    "relative to this ambient medium , we wish to study the motion of an ultrarelativistic jet emitted outward from a region near the source along the axis of rotation .",
    "consider a jet clump starting from @xmath51 and moving rapidly along the @xmath40-axis according to equation with @xmath52 .",
    "this relative motion is properly described in the first approximation using the generalized jacobi equation expressed in boyer - lindquist coordinates . to compare the consequences of such an equation with astronomical data regarding the motion of jets , it is appropriate to transform this equation to a quasi - inertial fermi normal coordinate system that is established along the reference trajectory .",
    "explicit _ relationship between the boyer - lindquist coordinate system of kerr spacetime and the fermi system is not needed for the derivation of the equation of relative motion in fermi coordinates .",
    "we therefore proceed keeping in mind that the radial coordinate @xmath42 of the jet clump is a function of the fermi coordinates , @xmath53 , but that this relationship shall remain implicit throughout this work .    along the worldline of a generic outward moving test particle with @xmath49 on the rotation axis , we establish a fermi coordinate system @xmath54 based on an orthonormal nonrotating ( i.e. fermi - walker transported ) tetrad frame . the free test particle follows a geodesic ; therefore , fermi - walker transport reduces to parallel transport in this case .",
    "the fermi coordinates of the reference particle are then @xmath55 , i.e. the reference particle is at the spatial origin of the fermi coordinates .",
    "the quasi - inertial fermi system is the one appropriate for the comparison of the theory with observation as well as newtonian physics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the speed of a jet is determined by monitoring the motion of a jet clump with respect to neighboring ",
    "fixed \" features of the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the motion of the jet clump relative to the reference particle in the fermi system is given by the tidal equation @xcite    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and the curvature @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 here @xmath42 is the boyer - lindquist radial coordinate of the _ reference _ particle and @xmath60 can be determined from the integration of the second equation in   with @xmath50 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we will be concerned with regions along the rotation axis such that @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 . solving equation with @xmath49 and @xmath65 for @xmath60 and substituting this in equation gives us the appropriate @xmath66 to use in the tidal equation .",
    "let us note that equations   are valid for any free reference particle moving along the rotation axis of the kerr source .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the source @xmath67 appears in equations   and   as @xmath68 , so that these equations are invariant under the transformation @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that the sense of rotation of the black hole is of no consequence for the phenomena described in this section .",
    "this is consistent with the double - jet structure observed in astrophysics .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to treat only the motion of particles moving outward above the north pole of the black hole .",
    "it is important to mention here that the main results of this work are independent of the precise nature of the massive source . for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we have assumed that the source is a kerr black hole with @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , we will concentrate on a jet clump launched from @xmath71 and moving along the positive @xmath40-axis .",
    "however , equations  depend upon @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 , which is very small for @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , our main results are insensitive to the ratio @xmath75 .",
    "that is , our main conclusions remain the same even if the source is spherically symmetric @xmath76 and the jet clump is launched along _ a radial direction_.    the tidal equation   in principle contains an infinite series in powers of the quantity @xmath77 , where @xmath0 is the effective radius of curvature such that @xmath78 . for regions of interest in this work @xmath79 and",
    "hence @xmath80 starting from @xmath81 corresponding to @xmath82 at @xmath83 , we integrate equation with a given initial @xmath84 . for a highly relativistic jet clump , the initial lorentz factor @xmath85",
    "is such that @xmath86 .",
    "the integration time @xmath87 must be limited such that @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is given by equation at @xmath81 .",
    "it is important to note that the endpoint of the integration is only known implicitly in terms of the boyer - lindquist radial coordinate @xmath42 .",
    "there is , of course , a definite relationship between the boyer - lindquist coordinates and the corresponding fermi coordinates .",
    "however , this relationship remains implicit here ; making it explicit would immediately imply that we know the tidal equation   to all orders  @xcite .",
    "the first - order approximation of the tidal equation corresponds to the generalized jacobi equation , @xmath90 this equation has solutions corresponding to @xmath91 , or @xmath92 , where the jet moves with uniform speed relative to the reference particle . for our reference particle with @xmath49 , these special solutions are attractors @xcite .",
    "starting near the kerr black hole and moving along the positive @xmath40-axis , an initially ultrarelativistic jet clump decelerates rapidly relative to the reference particle ( @xmath93 ) according to equation  .",
    "this initial deceleration and approach to @xmath94 is depicted within the domain of validity of equation in figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:1a ] for three clumps with initial lorentz factors of @xmath95 , 100 and 10 .",
    "the critical speeds @xmath96 that appear in equation   correspond to the critical lorentz factor @xmath97 .",
    "a particle of mass @xmath98 with a lorentz factor of @xmath99 has kinetic momentum @xmath98 , hence its de broglie wavelength equals its compton wavelength . for our present purposes ,",
    "the motion of a particle is _ ultrarelativistic _ if its corresponding lorentz factor @xmath100 exceeds @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath101 , the tidal equation has already been extensively studied in the field of a kerr black hole  @xcite .",
    "the novel deceleration effect is thus a consequence of equation   restricted to ultrarelativistic motion along a certain straight line .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the application of the generalized jacobi equation to the motion of astrophysical jets @xcite .",
    "thus imagine a rotating gravitational source with a double jet system moving outward along its axis of rotation .",
    "we have assumed that the fermi coordinates established along an ambient trajectory that lies on the axis of rotational symmetry of the source are such that the axis of rotation is the @xmath102-axis . concentrating on an ultrarelativistic jet moving along the positive @xmath102-axis , one finds that equation in this case involves a remarkably strong initial deceleration followed by a gradual decline toward a terminal speed given by @xmath103 . starting with an ultrarelativistic jet , this terminal speed",
    "is approached asymptotically after an infinite period of time . on the other hand ,",
    "the generalized jacobi equation is only valid for a rather limited timescale that nevertheless covers the initial rapid drop in velocity .",
    "figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:1a ] illustrate the main result of this paper regarding tidal deceleration ; therefore , it is worthwhile to develop an approximate analytic understanding of how this tidal deceleration comes about . to fix our ideas , we focus attention in what follows on a jet clump with an initial lorentz factor @xmath104 moving along the positive @xmath40-direction relative to a free test particle of the ambient medium . at @xmath83 , @xmath82 ,",
    "i.e. the jet starts from the position of the reference particle on the @xmath40-axis , where @xmath105 according to equation with @xmath49 and @xmath106 .",
    "it follows that in equation , @xmath107    starting from equation   and writing @xmath108 , it is simple to show that equation   can be completely integrated for a constant curvature @xmath109 ; in fact , the phase diagram for this case has been given schematically in figure  2 of  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath110 , however , let us note that @xmath111 since @xmath64 , it follows form equation   that if @xmath112 , @xmath113 increases toward @xmath114 , while if @xmath115 , @xmath113 decreases toward @xmath114 .",
    "integrating equation  , we find @xmath116 to find an approximate solution of this equation we write equation in the form @xmath117 assuming that @xmath118 and @xmath104 , the left side of equation   can be approximately written as @xmath119 .",
    "next , in the integrand of equation we let @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and note that @xmath122\\ ] ] using equation . here",
    "@xmath123 is defined by @xmath124 so that @xmath125 , using equation  . for @xmath126",
    ", one can show that @xmath127 equations   thus imply that @xmath128 or @xmath129 .",
    "this result provides an approximate solution of equation   for @xmath104 , @xmath118 and @xmath130 .",
    "indeed , a graph of equation   is almost indistinguishable from the corresponding numerical solution of equation   presented in figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:1a ] .    to get an estimate of the time @xmath87 that it would take for a highly relativistic jet clump with @xmath131 to decelerate to @xmath100 , where @xmath132 , we note that @xmath133 once we neglect @xmath134 compared with @xmath135 .",
    "thus equation   can be written as @xmath136 it follows that the deceleration time is essentially independent of @xmath137 .",
    "this remarkable result is already evident from the form of equation : for @xmath138 , the left side of equation is nearly independent of @xmath137 . in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] , for instance , @xmath139 and the time it takes for @xmath100 to decrease to @xmath140 from any initial @xmath141 should be @xmath142 based on equation , in good agreement with the numerical results of figure  [ fig:1 ] . thus no matter how relativistic the clump may be initially at @xmath139 , it decelerates to @xmath140 in a short time of order @xmath143 . moreover , this time is within the limit of validity of the generalized jacobi equation , since equation may be written as @xmath144 the difference between figure  [ fig:1 ] and figure  [ fig:1a ] is a reflection of the fact that the curvature @xmath109 decreases as the inverse cube of the radial distance @xmath145 from the black hole and , using equation for a fixed @xmath100 , @xmath146 , which is reminiscent of kepler s third law .",
    "thus far we have considered only one reference particle of the ambient medium with @xmath93 .",
    "let us now imagine @xmath147 such particles all with @xmath93 distributed along the rotation axis of the source and constituting  fixed \" features of the ambient medium that can be used for reference purposes .",
    "more specifically , let the boyer - lindquist radial coordinates @xmath148 , @xmath149 , of the particles be such that @xmath150 ; moreover , each interval is small enough that the generalized jacobi equation is valid within this interval to a reasonably good approximation .",
    "that is , @xmath147 different fermi frames can be established that are centered on the @xmath147 particles and the generalized jacobi equation can be applied separately within each interval @xmath151 $ ] , so that if the initial speed of the jet clump relative to @xmath148 is more than the terminal speed , the clump continues to decelerate within this interval , and so on .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the remarkable feature of equations   noted above : they do not explicitly depend on any specific reference particle with @xmath93 . in this sense , the clump decelerates _ with respect to the ambient medium _ toward the terminal speed .",
    "as the jet clump approaches the terminal speed , the first - order tidal term proportional to @xmath152 in equation approaches zero and hence the higher - order tidal terms , neglected in equation , become dominant . a complete knowledge of these terms is then required to predict the subsequent evolution of the flow .",
    "it may be that at such a time the clump is sufficiently far from the black hole that tidal effects become unimportant and plasma forces take over the dynamics of the clump @xcite .",
    "consider now the tidal equation in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath153 .",
    "the first - order approximation leads in this case to the standard jacobi equation , i.e. equation but with @xmath152 replaced by unity . as explained before , for a clump along the rotation axis at @xmath42 with @xmath154 , @xmath79 just as in newtonian mechanics .",
    "the tidal force of the central source in this case simply tends to pull the clump and the reference particle apart , leading to a relative tidal _ acceleration_. the result of",
    "the integration of the standard jacobi equation is in this case essentially the same as in the newtonian theory @xcite , which is studied in the next section .",
    "it is useful to compare the main results of the relativistic approach with the newtonian theory of tides , since our main conclusions regarding tidal deceleration and terminal speed have no counterparts in the newtonian approach and hence violate our  nonrelativistic \" intuition .",
    "let us consider in the background inertial coordinate system @xmath32 , the newtonian equations of motion of the jet clump at @xmath42 and the reference particle at @xmath155 along the rotation axis of the source @xmath156 we are interested in the relative motion ; therefore , with @xmath157 , @xmath158 for @xmath159 , this equation can be written as @xmath160 which should be compared and contrasted with equation .",
    "the higher - order newtonian tidal terms are considered in  [ appen : b ] .",
    "let us assume as before that the reference particle has zero energy , so that its kinetic and potential energies add up to zero ; then , @xmath161 can be simply integrated and the result is @xmath162 where @xmath163 at @xmath164 . substituting this result in equation , we find to linear order in @xmath165 @xmath166 which can be solved with boundary conditions that @xmath167 and @xmath168 at @xmath164 . here",
    "@xmath169 is the initial speed of the jet clump relative to the reference particle .",
    "the radial newtonian tidal force tends to pull the particles apart ; therefore , @xmath170 monotonically increases for the duration of the validity of the approximation used here .",
    "this is the complete opposite of what happens in the relativistic theory for an initially ultrarelativistic relative speed .",
    "an interesting feature of equation   is therefore that the nature of the tidal force changes depending on whether @xmath113 is below or above the critical value @xmath171 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath172 the tides behave essentially as in newtonian mechanics , i.e. the particle accelerates  its speed approaching @xmath103 very slowly  relative to the reference particle .",
    "the character of the tides in a model star falling into a kerr black hole has been investigated in detail in  @xcite using the jacobi equation ; the results are similar as in newtonian gravitation except possibly when the model star is very close to the horizon of the black hole . on the other hand , for @xmath173",
    "the tides behave in the opposite way ( see figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:1a ] ) .    comparing the newtonian behavior with the consequences of equations  , we recognize the significance of the relativistic tidal acceleration term @xmath174 for the difference between the results of the two theories .",
    "thus tidal deceleration and terminal speed exhibited by are due to this gravitomagnetic ( i.e. motional ) tidal effect that is purely relativistic and thus goes beyond newtonian gravitation .",
    "the higher - order tidal terms  @xcite in equation   are treated using a certain post - newtonian approach in  [ appen : b ] .",
    "it is interesting to explore the dynamics of the three - dimensional generalized jacobi equation using the same reference trajectory as before .",
    "the components of the curvature tensor in the fermi coordinate system established along this worldline are given by  @xcite @xmath175 these are the only nonzero components except , of course , for the symmetries of the riemann tensor . here",
    "@xmath176 , @xmath109 is given by equation and @xmath177 is directly proportional to the angular momentum of the source and is given by @xmath178 one can interpret @xmath177 as the  magnetic \" curvature , while @xmath109 has the interpretation of  electric \" curvature .",
    "it is a significant feature of equations   that they are independent of the lorentz factor of the reference trajectory @xmath48 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the axis of rotational symmetry in the kerr metric provides two special tidal directions  corresponding to ingoing and outgoing trajectories  such that @xmath109 and @xmath177 are independent of any lorentz boosts along these directions  @xcite .",
    "these special tidal directions are related to the repeated principal null directions of the curvature tensor and therefore the degenerate nature of kerr spacetime .",
    "that is , the special tidal directions exist at each event in kerr spacetime , since it is a vacuum spacetime of type @xmath179 in the petrov classification  @xcite .",
    "the significance of such directions in connection with the direction of an astrophysical jet has been pointed out in  @xcite : to preserve the collimation of a highly relativistic jet against tidal disruptions caused by the central source , the most natural jet direction would be a special tidal direction .",
    "moreover , of all the special tidal directions the kerr rotation axis has the additional advantage of being in conformity with the symmetry of the configuration under consideration .    using equations  , it is possible to express equation as @xmath180 + \\frac{1}{3 } k\\dot{x } ( 5y\\dot{y } -7z\\dot{z})\\\\ & & \\qquad + q[\\dot{x}\\dot{y}\\dot{z } x-\\dot{z}y(1+\\dot{x}^2)-2\\dot{y}z]=0,\\\\ \\label{eq30 } \\nonumber & & \\ddot{y}- \\frac{1}{2 } ky\\big [ 1 - 2\\dot{y}^2 + \\frac{2}{3 } ( 2 \\dot{x}^2-\\dot{z}^2)\\big ] + \\frac{1}{3 } k\\dot{y } ( 5x\\dot{x } -7z\\dot{z})\\\\ & & \\qquad - q [ \\dot{x}\\dot{y}\\dot{z}y-\\dot{z}x(1+\\dot{y}^2)-2\\dot{x}z]=0,\\\\ \\label{eq31 } \\nonumber & & \\ddot{z } + kz\\big [ 1 - 2\\dot{z}^2+\\frac{1}{3 } ( \\dot{x}^2+\\dot{y}^2)\\big ] + \\frac{2}{3 } k\\dot{z } ( x\\dot{x } + y\\dot{y})\\\\ & & \\qquad - q(x\\dot{y}-\\dot{x } y)(1-\\dot{z}^2)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 , etc .",
    "these equations reduce to the one - dimensional generalized jacobi equation   for @xmath182 .",
    "it is simple to check that equations   are invariant under the transformations @xmath183 and @xmath184 , since @xmath177 is directly related to the rotation of the source .",
    "furthermore , equations   are also invariant under parity or time reversal if in each case we also change @xmath177 to @xmath185 .",
    "it is interesting to note an important symmetry of the system   under rotations about the @xmath102-axis .",
    "the rotational symmetry about the direction of the motion of the reference particle implies that there is a degeneracy in the choice of the @xmath186 and @xmath187 axes of the tetrad frame of the reference observer . once an orthonormal tetrad is chosen , however , it is then parallel transported along the reference worldline .",
    "nevertheless , the axial symmetry of the configuration under consideration implies that under a rotation about the @xmath102-axis with a constant azimuthal angle @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , the system   remains invariant .",
    "this symmetry can , of course , be checked directly ; for instance , for @xmath191 we have @xmath192 and @xmath193 and it is simple to see that the transformation @xmath194 leaves the system   invariant .",

    "an example of this situation is provided by the motion of a particle starting from the origin at @xmath237 with velocity components given by @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 . while the dynamics of this case is complicated ,",
    "numerical experiments show that @xmath100 slowly decreases with time .",
    "it follows from these results that highly relativistic particles emitted near a gravitationally collapsed configuration are accelerated along directions normal to the rotation axis and hence immediately leave the black hole environment , while highly relativistic particles emitted along the rotation axis are decelerated and appear as jets .",
    "if the collapsed configuration is nonrotating , then deceleration occurs along the radial direction and acceleration occurs in directions normal to the radial direction .",
    "we have performed a series of numerical experiments to delineate the regions of acceleration and deceleration of particles relative to the reference particle .",
    "the results are represented in figure  [ fig:8 ] . for @xmath241 ,",
    "numerical experiments show that @xmath242 is independent of @xmath137 and is given approximately by @xmath243 , so that @xmath244 . in our numerical experiments , @xmath242 remained approximately constant for @xmath245 and @xmath246 .    to see how this comes about from an approximate analytical point of view , we consider equations   in cylindrical coordinates , namely , equations  . it follows from our numerical experiments that the influence of the rotation of the source on the relative motion is generally negligible . to simplify matters , the rotation of the source can therefore be neglected and we then confine our considerations to the @xmath247-halfplane , since @xmath248 is a solution of equation   with @xmath249 . thus the equations of motion reduce to @xmath250 where @xmath251 and @xmath252 if we set @xmath253 , equations   and   reduce to the standard jacobi equation ; therefore",
    ", the special deceleration / acceleration phenomena discussed in this work come about as a consequence of the existence of nonzero @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "let us now consider a particle starting out at time @xmath237 from the position of the reference particle at @xmath256 .",
    "we will predict the motion of the test particle , determined by equations   and  , in case its initial velocity vector is @xmath257 , where @xmath258 and the initial velocity vector makes an angle @xmath242 with respect to the @xmath102-axis . to do this",

    ", we find that for @xmath266 , @xmath267 for @xmath268 , we have deceleration , while for @xmath269 , we have acceleration according to equations   and  .",
    "thus the boundary region is given by @xmath270 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:8 ] .",
    "in this paper , we are interested in some of the observable consequences of general relativity involving ultrarelativistic flows near a gravitationally collapsed configuration .",
    "the measurement problem in general relativity is rather subtle .",
    "suppose , for instance , that in the background of kerr spacetime one succeeds in solving certain covariant equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "though possibly interesting , this result per se may have little to do with understanding the _ observable _ consequences of general relativistic mhd in this case . as a first step , we therefore concentrate on an _ invariant _ characterization of the dynamics of free particles in the exterior kerr spacetime ;",
    "in particular , we study _ relative _ motion in the simplest possible situation , namely , the motion of free particles relative to a certain fiducial class of particles moving freely on escape trajectories along the rotation axis of the kerr source . the relative motion of two nearby free particles is then determined by the generalized jacobi equation .",
    "the generalized jacobi equation has been known for three decades  @xcite , but its physical consequences for relativistic relative motion have only recently received attention  @xcite .",
    "an important issue regarding the generalized jacobi equation is that for ultrarelativistic relative motion , the duration of validity of this equation is rather short .",
    "however , we have shown that even within this limit , for ultrarelativistic outward motion along the rotation axis of a kerr black hole , there is a remarkably strong initial tidal deceleration relative to the ambient medium regardless of the value of @xmath131 . to go beyond this initial deceleration ,",
    "let us note that a significant feature of our basic equations   is that they do not explicitly depend on the reference trajectory corresponding to a  fixed \" marker in the ambient medium .",
    "one can therefore imagine a number of such markers along the path of the jet such that from one marker to the next , the integration of equation describes the force - free jet deceleration to a good approximation . in this way",
    ", one may approach the terminal speed of the jet by referring the jet motion to different markers .",
    "so long as the jet speed relative to any nearby ambient marker is significantly greater than @xmath103 , it tends to decrease toward this terminal speed .",
    "it is possible to view the terminal speed in another way . along a radial direction",
    "far from a massive source , its tidal influence on two neighboring test particles is a tidal _ acceleration _ if the relative speed of the particles is significantly below @xmath103 .",
    "however , this influence turns to a tidal _ deceleration _ if the relative speed is significantly above @xmath103 .",
    "we have neglected plasma effects in this paper ; in fact , our treatment is valid for a force - free plasma .",
    "if the plasma is not force - free , the inclusion of its effects would enormously complicate matters @xcite . in any case ,",
    "tidal deceleration is most effective very close to the central source , where the jet originates .",
    "moreover , it is expected to be more significant for microquasars , since tidal effects near a black hole generally decrease as the inverse square of the mass of the source .",
    "thus the results of this paper may well play a significant role in the dynamics of jets , especially in microquasars  @xcite . more generally , this work may be of interest in connection with the astrophysics of energetic particles such as the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays .",
    "let us now turn to the motion of a particle normal to the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "relative to the reference particle , the particle accelerates if its initial speed exceeds the critical speed @xmath103 . for ultrarelativistic relative motion ,",
    "this tidal acceleration can lead to ultrahigh energy particles according to the generalized jacobi equation ; more generally , particle acceleration occurs outside a cone of angle @xmath242 , where the polar angle @xmath242 is measured from the @xmath102-axis and @xmath271 .",
    "as the particle accelerates beyond the fermi system , one can in principle use other overlapping coordinate systems to describe the motion over an extended period of time .",
    "on the other hand , the tidal effects of the black hole diminish rapidly with increasing distance and hence the influence of the black hole can be neglected once the particle has moved sufficiently far away .",
    "the rotation of the source leads to a preferred radial direction , i.e. the axis of rotation , but is otherwise of little importance for the tidal dynamics presented in this paper .",
    "this remark applies equally well to the exact nature of the source , except that our results become physically significant near gravitationally collapsed objects , where tidal accelerations can be substantial .",
    "the nature of the accretion mechanisms that create ultrarelativistic particles near black holes is beyond the scope of our investigation .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper based on the generalized jacobi equation indicates that once such particles are created near the poles of the black hole , those propagating mainly along the rotation axis of the black hole decelerate with respect to the ambient medium , while those propagating mainly normal to this axis can accelerate to almost the speed of light .",
    "the loss of kinetic energy for the motion of an initially ultrarelativistic particle along the rotation axis and the gain in kinetic energy for motion normal to this axis may be attributed , in analogy with newtonian gravitation , to the change in the gravitational potential energy , which is the tidal energy in the case under consideration in this paper .",
    "the underlying assumption here is that the perturbation of the background geometry caused by the motion of the test particle may be neglected .",
    "this breaks down , however , when the particle is accelerated to almost the speed of light ; therefore , the back - reaction on the motion is expected to moderate this singularity leading to an ultrahigh energy particle . more generally , the gravitational and electromagnetic ( in case of charged particles )",
    "radiations emitted by the decelerating / accelerating particles should be taken into account as well .",
    "the tidal acceleration mechanism may provide the key to the explanation of recent _ chandra _ x - ray observations of the crab nebula .",
    "it is well known that primary ultrahigh energy cosmic ray protons with energies above @xmath272 ev from extragalactic sources are expected to interact with the cosmic microwave background photons resulting in photopion production and pair creation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may be reasonable to assume that the most energetic particles that reach the solar system originate within our galaxy ( see  @xcite for a recent review of cosmic ray astrophysics ) . in view of the foregoing results ,",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether the directional distribution of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays is correlated with the known microquasars , taking due account of the directionality of the acceleration zones normal to the jet directions .",
    "in system   , let us introduce the cylindrical coordinates @xmath273 , @xmath274 and @xmath102 , where @xmath275 the resulting system is given by @xmath276\\\\ & & \\qquad + q\\rho \\dot\\varphi(\\rho\\dot\\rho\\dot z-2z)=0,\\\\ \\label{mu:45 }   & & \\rho\\ddot\\varphi+2\\dot\\rho\\dot\\varphi + \\frac{1}{3}k\\rho\\dot\\varphi(5\\rho\\dot\\rho-7 z\\dot z ) + q[2\\dot\\rho z+\\rho\\dot z(1+\\rho^2\\dot\\varphi^2)]=0,\\quad\\\\ \\label{mu:46 }   & & \\nonumber \\ddot z+k\\{z[1+\\frac{1}{3}(\\dot\\rho^2+\\rho^2\\dot\\varphi^2)-2\\dot z^2 ] + \\frac{2}{3}\\rho\\dot\\rho\\dot z\\}\\\\ & & \\qquad - q\\rho^2\\dot\\varphi(1-\\dot z^2)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this system depends on @xmath274 only through @xmath277 and @xmath278 and is therefore invariant under @xmath279 , which again reflects the axial symmetry of the system .",
    "a remarkable feature of system   is that for @xmath280 and @xmath82 , the system reduces to purely radial motion given by @xmath281 which is the same form as equation   except for @xmath218 .",
    "this reversal of sign of the curvature leads to the _ acceleration _ of an ultrarelativistic particle that is launched from @xmath282 in a direction normal to the @xmath102-axis as illustrated in figures  [ fig:7 ] and  [ fig:7b ] .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that the tidal equation is derived from a lagrangian given in fermi coordinates by @xmath283 where the metric components in fermi coordinates are given by equation  . using equations   , it is possible to show that in our approximation the lagrangian reduces to @xmath284 where @xmath285 is given by @xmath286 expressed in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath287 takes the form @xmath288 where @xmath289 here @xmath274 is a cyclic coordinate ; therefore , @xmath290 is an approximate constant of the motion for system   given by @xmath291\\rho^2\\dot\\varphi+q(t)\\rho^2 z }   { \\sqrt { 1-\\dot\\rho^2-\\rho^2 \\dot\\varphi^2-\\dot z^2 -\\frac{1}{2}k(t ) \\psi-2q(t)\\rho^2\\dot\\varphi z}}\\,.\\ ] ] one can interpret @xmath292 as a generalized orbital angular momentum about the @xmath102-axis ; its approximate constancy in time is related to the axial symmetry of the system  . we do not know if system   is lagrangian .",
    "it is in principle possible to obtain the infinite set of higher - order tidal accelerations that have been ignored in our analysis thus far .",
    "moreover , we must impose the requirement that for a timelike geodesic @xmath293 .",
    "the generalized jacobi equation contains the first - order tidal terms  @xcite .",
    "tidal terms of second and third order were first calculated in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively . based on these previous detailed calculations ,",
    "the first two such contributions to equation can be computed and hence the resulting augmented form of equation is @xmath294 here @xmath57 , @xmath109 is given by equation as before and @xmath295 along the reference worldline where @xmath296 . in principle , the projections of the covariant derivatives of the riemann curvature tensor of kerr spacetime on the tetrad frame of the reference particle evaluated along its worldline are required for the determination of the higher - order tidal accelerations . however , for @xmath71 , it is simpler and more instructive to employ the linear approximation of general relativity as follows .",
    "the linearized kerr metric in the post - newtonian framework is given by @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the newtonian potential .",
    "this metric can be written as @xmath299 , where @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath302 is proportional to the gravitomagnetic vector potential .",
    "the riemann tensor in the linear approximation is given by @xmath303 which can be represented in the standard manner as a symmetric @xmath304 matrix with indices that range over the set @xmath305 .",
    "for the linearized kerr metric  , we have such a representation in terms of symmetric and traceless @xmath306 matrices @xmath307 and @xmath308 , @xmath309,\\ ] ] where @xmath307 and @xmath308 are the electric and magnetic parts of the curvature and @xmath310.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the _ linear _ approximation under consideration here @xmath311 along the reference worldline in effect reduces to @xmath312 in the computation of the riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives ( which reduce to partial derivatives ) as measured by the reference particle .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that along the reference trajectory @xmath313 , the riemann tensor measured by the reference particle turns out to be identical to equations   without the @xmath68 terms , as can be verified by direct calculation using   and  .",
    "the rotation of the source plays a rather minor role in the numerical results of this paper ; therefore , for the sake of simplicity we will set @xmath314 in the computation of @xmath315 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 and @xmath318 .",
    "we find that @xmath319 and @xmath320 , @xmath321 so that @xmath322 and @xmath323 along the reference path @xmath324 .",
    "it follows that the results in equation   agree with the higher - order newtonian tidal terms in equation  .",
    "thus the first term on the right - hand side of   contains the higher - order newtonian tidal terms once @xmath325 in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "equation   can now be integrated with @xmath326 given by  ; the results of this integration are presented in figure  [ newnewfig:6 ] , where the lorentz factor versus @xmath87 is given for @xmath241 and initial lorentz factors 1000 , 100 and 10 .",
    "this figure should be compared and contrasted with figure  [ fig:1a ] .",
    "let us now turn to the higher - order tidal corrections to equation  .",
    "based on the detailed treatments in  @xcite , the result is @xmath327 using our approximation scheme with @xmath314 , we find that along the trajectory @xmath328 and @xmath329 equation   can be integrated with @xmath326 given by  ; the lorentz factor versus @xmath87 is given in figure  [ newnewfig:7 ] for @xmath241 .",
    "the results should be compared and contrasted with those given in figure  [ fig:7b ] .",
    "the terms in equations   and   proportional to @xmath330 make negligible contributions to the numerical work presented in figures  [ newnewfig:6 ] and  [ newnewfig:7 ] , respectively , in agreement with our approximation scheme .    within the limit of validity of the tidal equation , the higher - order tidal terms provide small corrections to the generalized jacobi equation as in figures  [ newnewfig:6 ] and  [ newnewfig:7 ] .",
    "to demonstrate that the main results of this paper , namely , the strong initial tidal deceleration of ultrarelativistic flows along the rotation axis and the acceleration normal to this axis will remain unchanged by the addition of the higher - order tidal terms , we have integrated equations   and   with the same initial data as in figures  [ fig:1a ] and  [ fig:7b ] , respectively .",
    "the results are presented in figures  [ newnewfig:6 ] and [ newnewfig:7 ] , respectively , which appear to be almost identical to figures  [ fig:1a ] and [ fig:7b ] , respectively and demonstrate that the higher - order tidal terms slightly enhance the deceleration effect and tend to moderate the acceleration effect .",
    "for instance , in figure  [ fig:1a ] , the graph for initial @xmath331 reaches @xmath332 at @xmath333 , while in figure  [ newnewfig:6 ] it reaches @xmath334 .",
    "nevertheless , figures  [ newnewfig:6 ] and  [ newnewfig:7 ] demonstrate that the inclusion of higher - order tidal terms will not change the main results of this work .",
    "concerning the tails in figures  [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:1a ] and [ newnewfig:6 ] , we note that so long as the initial @xmath137 is well above the critical value of @xmath335 , a temporal interval of integration can be found such that the flow decelerates as described in detail in this paper .",
    "however , the size of this temporal interval of validity decreases as the flow speed approaches the critical speed .",
    "thus sufficiently close to the critical speed our approach loses its validity .",
    "moreover , based on the available terms of the tidal equation , it is clear that the critical speed @xmath103 is _ not _ a feature of the general tidal equation in this case .",
    "it follows that our treatment breaks down when the jet clump decelerates to a speed sufficiently close to this critical speed .",
    "on the astrophysical side , we note that by the time the clump decelerates close to the critical speed relative to the ambient medium , the black hole may be sufficiently far from the clump that tidal effects may no longer play a significant role in the subsequent motion of the clump .      c. chicone and b. mashhoon , _ class .",
