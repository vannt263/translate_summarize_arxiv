    "the ability to trap and cool atoms in optical lattices  @xcite has opened up new avenues in atomic physics .",
    "this has , perhaps unexpectedly , moved this area closer to condensed matter physics .",
    "optical lattices are in fact one of the most promising candidates for the realisation of a universal quantum simulator  @xcite .",
    "this is a programmable quantum system that can be made to evolve according to a desired theoretical model .",
    "one of the first proposals of a quantum simulator with ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices was the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite where the implementation of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) was suggested and later implemented  @xcite .",
    "this model was originally a more abstract version of the corresponding fermionic hubbard model which describes the propagation of fermionic particles in conductors .",
    "the bhm exhibits quite interesting physics with an interaction induced insulator called the mott - insulator state and a dissipation free conducting superfluid  @xcite .",
    "since then a plethora of proposals of quantum simulators with cold atoms has been put forward that include different lattice geometries , disorder , impurities , interactions beyond nearest - neighbour , synthetic gauge fields , spin - orbit coupling , multi - orbital bhm , etc .",
    "besides condensed matter physics , applications in high - energy physics and controlled quantum chemistry have also been put forward @xcite .",
    "readout of ultracold atom quantum simulators has so far mostly been achieved using time - of - flight experiments @xcite and lately also using single - site resolved microscopy  @xcite .",
    "the former method provides the momentum distribution and density - density correlations of the atomic sample in the trap , thus allowing one to distinguish between mott - insulator and superfluid states .",
    "the latter gives information about occupations in individual sites and can therefore be used to compute density - density correlations between specific sites @xcite .",
    "other possible measurement schemes involve optical bragg scattering that gives information about dynamical structure factors  @xcite .",
    "these examples of detection methods are all destructive : the sample is released from the trap as in time - of - flight experiments and the system quantum state is incoherently projected onto a fock basis and strongly heated using single - site imaging .",
    "two alternative quantum non - demolition schemes have recently been proposed : one based on coupling lattice sites to individual cavities @xcite , and quantum polarization spectroscopy ( qps ) @xcite .",
    "in this work we focus on the latter in which probing light is rotated due to the faraday rotation induced by the magnetic moments of the illuminated atoms ( see the proposed setup in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",

    "the beam is split by a beamsplitter ( bs ) and measured by homodyne detection ( hd ) . ]",
    "theoretical publications have so far proven the detection of magnetic phases of spin and fermionic systems with qps by analysing the polarization fluctuations of the light emerging from the sample  @xcite . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the output light signal can be connected to magnetic order parameters thus signalling critical points .",
    "this detection method can even be reversed , in a sense , to enable state preparation by engineering desired spin correlations through successive operations  @xcite .",
    "so far , the qps scheme has not been applied to the characterisation of quantum phase transitions in bhms , which will be the main focus of this work .    here",
    "we showcase the power and flexibility of this technique to characterise the ground state of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bhm in three distinct variants .",
    "first , we start with the pure homogeneous 1d - bhm and we show how to employ the qps scheme to distinguish the mott insulator ( mi ) and superfluid ( sf ) states .",
    "the precise determination of the mott insulator to superfluid critical point has proven to be a hard task because commonly used techniques , such as the visibility of interference peaks in time - of - flight , give a smooth signal across the transition . here",
    "we show , using numerical simulations , that our technique is capable of detecting not only a quantitative but also a qualitative change in behaviour across the transition allowing us to get a fairly accurate estimate of the critical point .",
    "second , we consider the extended bhm ( ebhm ) obtained by adding a nearest - neighbour interaction term arising , for example , for dipolar atoms . in this model ,",
    "two further insulating phases appear : a haldane insulator ( hi ) , characterised by a non - local hidden order and a density wave ( dw ) phase exhibiting a spatial density modulation @xcite . in this",
    "setting we show how to locate the critical point between the two phases .",
    "finally , we consider bosonic atoms in a superlattice potential recently proposed for implementing atomic transistors and single and two - qubit gates  @xcite . in this",
    "setting the qps method allows us to detect different atomic patterns arising in the superlattice .",
