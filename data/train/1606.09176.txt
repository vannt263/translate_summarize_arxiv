    "we notice a trend for the dbp approaches ( diamond and square markers ) to have lower airs than the sdbp approaches ( plus and circle markers ) , and also that the airs behave differently for dbp and sdbp .",
    "specifically , we can observe from the dbp curves that up to about @xmath122 dbm power , the behavior of this link is approximately linear . at higher powers ( beyond @xmath123 dbm for dbp and @xmath124 dbm for sdbp ) , nonlinearity comes into play and the air decreases .",
    "however , the air for dbp decreases faster than that of sdbp , which means that sdbp performs better in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this is an expected behavior because sdbp accounts for the nonlinear signal  noise interactions , which dbp does not account for .",
    "if we compare airs between dbp techniques , dbp - cg ( square markers ) has better air than dbp - iidg ( diamond markers ) , as the former accounts for the correlation between the in - phase and quadrature components .",

    "the gains are lower for both gmp - sdbp and sbs - sdbp when dbp - cg is used as a benchmark technique .",
    "this is expected , and is in line with the conclusions of @xcite , as dbp - cg has better air than dbp - iidg .",
    "we can observe that using gmp - sdbp , 0.7 bits / symbol higher air is obtained compared to dbp - cg .",

    "the sdbp accounts for signal  noise interactions , which decreases as we increase the symbol rate .",
    "therefore , the performance of sdbp approaches dbp with increasing symbol rate .      the computation of lower bounds on the mi using either an afc or an abc are two different ways with their own advantages and disadvantages . if an afc is available , then @xmath127 has to be calculated first , which may involve some integrals , and ( [ eqniqyxleqixy ] ) is used to lower - bound the mi .",
    "lower bounds on the mi can be obtained using an abc by using any conditional distribution @xmath23 , i.e. , by removing the constraint that @xmath35 in ( [ eqnkldgeq0 ] ) is induced by an afc .",
    "that is , if an abc is available , then ( [ eqniqxyleqixy ] ) can be used to lower - bound the mi without explicitly finding an afc .",

    "firstly , computation of airs through the abc using ( [ eqnmimc_irxvecy ] ) is applicable for dual polarization also.sbs-sdbp has been developed for dual polarization @xcite and gmp - sdbp can be extended to dual polarization .",
    "a single polarization was used for computing airs with gmp - sdbp in this paper for computational simplicity .",
    "we note that the polarization mode dispersion for a dual - polarization transmitter degrades the performance of both dbp and sdbp , as observed in @xcite , and hence the airs of fig .",
    "[ fig_airsdbp ] will be lowered .",
    "however , we conjecture that the relative gains of sdbp compared to dbp would be similar to what we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_airsdbp ] for a single polarization . secondly , the number of segments per span used in the simulation of the fiber using ssfm is the same as the ones used for dbp and sdbp .",
    "there exist many low - complexity variations of dbp , where the number of segments is optimized for real - time implementation .",
    "low - complexity variations of sdbp can be derived , e.g. , by optimizing the number of particles or segments per span @xcite .",
    "tighter lower bounds may possibly be obtained than those reported in the paper . here",
    "we present two different methods .",
    "firstly , in the gmp - sdbp , we used a linear gaussian message passing algorithm to account for the effect of the pulse shaper , which may not be an optimal strategy for the foc .",
    "we conjecture that when the distribution is represented in a particle form , techniques other than linear gaussian message passing might yield even tighter bounds than those presented in the paper . secondly , tighter bounds on the mi can be obtained by extending the principle used from afc to abc to a more general technique . the required property to",
    "lower - bound the mi using an afc and also an abc is @xmath128 in ( [ eqnkldgeq0 ] ) and ( [ eqnkldrrgeq0 ] ) .",
    "this principle can be extended by allowing @xmath5 in ( [ eqnkldgeq0 ] ) to be an arbitrary probability density function over @xmath60 that is not necessarily induced by @xmath3 or @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "traditionally , lower bounds on the mi were computed using an afc . in this paper , we computed lower bounds using an abc for the first time for the foc .",
    "these bounds are achievable by a maximum a posteriori detector based on the abc .",
    "two different distributions obtained through the sdbp algorithm are used as abcs for estimation of airs .",
    "both these distributions have better air in comparison to the state - of - the - art method of using dbp . through simulations",
    ", it was also found that up to 0.7 bit / symbol higher air is obtained using gmp - sdbp compared to dbp .",
    "this means that in comparison to the dbp approach , tighter lower bounds can be obtained using the sdbp approach .",
