    "in this paper we are going to discuss the paradox , concerning the collective quantization in the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath1qsm ) @xcite . in the su(3 ) @xmath1qsm , in analogy with the skyrme model @xcite  @xcite , one constructs the collective wave functions as the eigenstates of the symmetry generators such as flavor @xmath2 ( or isospin @xmath3 in the su(2 ) version of the model ) , @xmath4 run from 1@xmath58 .",
    "the su(2 ) subset of these indices denoted by capital letters @xmath6 , @xmath7 run from 1 to 3 , whereas indices denoted by @xmath8 , @xmath9 run from 4 to 7 . ] , and spin operators @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "there exists , however , the whole set of _ generalized _ spin generators including @xmath11 and @xmath12 which form the su(3 ) algebra . precisely speaking @xmath13 is a constant equal to @xmath14 .",
    "it is however understood , that it is a constant only on a subset of the entire hilbert space , providing a constraint for the physical states .",
    "this phenomenon is well known already from the su(3 ) skyrme model , and it has been believed that there was no difference between the two models as far as the the quantization procedure was concerned . in this paper we will show that this equivalence actually breaks down .",
    "all soliton models start from a classical , statical field configuration @xmath15 which is subsequently rotated by an su(2 ) or su(3 ) time - dependent matrix @xmath16 . leaving the details for the next sections ,",
    "let us quote one of the most celebrated results of the su(3 ) skyrme model , namely the relation between the _ generalized _ spin operators @xmath17 ( called often",
    "generators ) and the flavor ones @xmath18 ( _ left _ generators ) : @xmath19 where the summation over @xmath20 is assumed .",
    "indeed @xmath2 have proper commutation rules , provided @xmath21 satisfy the su(3 ) algebra and the coefficients @xmath22 are wigner matrices in the adjoint representation of su(3 ) ( or su(2 ) ) : @xmath23 eq.([eqts ] ) has been derived in the skyrme model and it was believed to be also true in the @xmath1qsm . in this paper we show that this relation is violated in the su(3 ) @xmath1qsm : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are dynamical quantities defined in section [ toy ] .",
    "this is precisely the paradox : one constructs wave functions as representations of flavor and _ generalized _ spin , however , there exists a relation between the two sets of generators , which prevents one of them ( in our case flavor ) from satisfying the proper commutation rules .",
    "it is relatively easy to argue that the troublesome term @xmath26 should be discarded , since our calculation was not complete as far as all @xmath27 corrections are concerned .",
    "indeed , one can imagine a number of other contributions of this order which we have neglected in deriving eq.([tsviol ] ) .",
    "there is , however , one catch in this reasoning .",
    "namely @xmath13 itself is of the order of @xmath28 , whereas all other @xmath29 in eq.([tsviol ] ) are of the order of 1 .",
    "in fact su(3 ) quantization also in the skyrme model mixes different orders in @xmath27 expansion .",
    "equation ( [ eqts ] ) itself contains terms of different order in @xmath28 , nevertheless without the subleading terms , namely @xmath30 , the commutation rules for flavor generators would not be satisfied either . for more complicated operators , as the charge operator for example , it is not possible to write an analogue of eq.([tsviol ] ) and clearly decide which terms should be interpreted as non - leading @xmath27 corrections and therefore discarded , and which , although subleading , should be nevertheless retained .",
    "there are two technical reasons for the breakdown of the relation ( [ eqts ] ) .",
    "the first one is that the su(3 ) soliton models are not fully su(3 ) symmetric .",
    "indeed , the su(3 ) soliton is usually obtained by the , so called , isospin embedding of the su(2 ) soliton .",
    "this means that one of the su(3 ) generators , in our case @xmath31 , has a non - zero expectation value between the soliton states .",
    "let us note in passing , that because there is no such operator in the two flavor case , the su(2 ) version of the model does not suffer from the quantization paradox @xcite .",
    "the second reason consists in the fact that @xmath1qsm has internal ( quark ) degrees of freedom which , in contrast to the skyrme model , give rise to the time - nonlocalities  @xcite while calculating expectation values .",
    "we will make all these statements clear in section [ toy ] , where a toy model formulation of the problem will be presented .",
    "earlier , in section [ guide ] , we will briefly recapitulate semiclassical quantization procedure and give literature where the details can be found . in section [ path ]",
    "we will reformulate the problem in terms of the path integral .",
    "unfortunately , despite many efforts , theoretically satisfactory solution of the quantization paradox has not yet been found .",
    "therefore we would like to propose a more modest approach .",
    "we will investigate a small soliton limit @xcite of the physical quantities of interest and require that they have limiting values corresponding to the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "this will allow us to identify the troublesome @xmath27 terms and analyze their structure in terms of the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "detailed analysis of the charge operator , axial couplings and magnetic moments will be carried in section [ smallsol ] .",
    "for the purpose of the comparison with the data we will subsequently discard these troublesome @xmath27 terms , while retaining the other subleading contributions .",
    "( symmetry conserving approach ) the results will be given in section [ numres ] , where the model predictions _ truncated _ in this way will be compared with experiment and also with the su(2 ) version of the model , which is free from the quantization ambiguities .",
    "although our procedure is in a sense arbitrary , it provides an insight into the origin of the problem .",
    "further support comes from the side of phenomenology , since the truncated observables agree better ( except for the magnetic moments ) with the data than the full ones .",
    "moreover , for the quantities which can be calculated also in the two flavor case , there is a striking agreement between su(2 ) and su(3 ) results .",
    "we will summarize our findings and present conclusions in section [ disc ] .",
    "the generating functional of qcd involves quark and gluon fields .",
    "one can imagine the following scenario : first integrate out gluons .",
    "the resulting action would then describe the non - linear and non - local many quark interactions .",
    "the next step would consists in linearizing this complicated action and expressing it in terms of local , color singlet composite fields corresponding to the pseudo - scalar mesons coupled in a chirally invariant way to the quark fields . and finally we would have to integrate out quarks to end up with a pion ( or @xmath32k@xmath33 ) effective lagrangian .",
    "so we go through a chain of effective actions : @xmath34\\rightarrow s_{{\\rm eff}}[q]\\rightarrow s_{{\\rm eff}}[q,\\,\\pi , k,\\eta ] \\rightarrow s_{{\\rm eff}}[\\pi , k,\\eta ] .",

    "in what follows we will neglect current quark masses @xmath40 .",
    "next we will assume that baryons can be described as _",
    "solitons _ @xciterw  @xcite of the effective action corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ eq - lag ] ) .",
    "that means that the goldstone fields described by matrix @xmath15 are , in a sense , large and fulfill classical equations of motion . to this end",

    "the left symmetry corresponds to flavor , whereas the right one to spin .",
    "in fact one can promote the right symmetry group to the full su(3 ) and then consider only the subset of the full hilbert space , for which the right hypercharge is equal to @xmath58 .",

    "indeed , in that case the plane wave spectrum would have to be replaced by the soliton spectrum , and the two terms in eq.([i2minus1 ] ) would cancel .",
    "this is precisely the reason why there is no antisymmetric piece in the su(2 ) case ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , with @xmath126 ) .",
    "the final expression for the flavor generators is obtained by contracting @xmath127  symbols : @xmath128 yielding : @xmath129    a few remarks concerning the last term in eq.([ts2 ] ) are in order .",
    "first , this term spoils commutation rules for the flavor generators .",
    "moreover it is non - diagonal in the su(3 ) representation space .",
    "finally , it would vanish for the symmetric spectrum , as clearly seen from eq.([i2minus1 ] ) and fig.1 .",

    "it was shown that in the su(2 ) version of the model the well known quark model result @xmath206 can be recovered only if the rotational correction proportional to @xmath207 is taken into account .",
    "this is a convincing argument in favor of the rotational corrections which originate from the time nonlocality of the quark loop .",
    "moreover , in the limit of large soliton size this correction is dying out much faster than the leading contribution .",
    "this result is also welcome , since in this limit @xmath208qsm results should reduce to the ones of the skyrme model . indeed , in the skyrme model",
    "this kind of rotational corrections does not exist , because the model is based on a local lagrangian density .",
    "here we are going to reverse the logic used in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will investigate the small soliton size of the su(3 ) formulae ( [ genform ] ) in order to identify terms which spoil the agreement with the quark model results .",

    "these two requirements suffice to identify unambiguously the troublesome terms .",
    "as we shall see these terms correspond to the quantities @xmath209 of eq.([xdef ] ) .    the nonrelativistic quark model ( nqm ) limit is most naturally defined in terms of a somewhat unphysical profile function @xmath210 with @xmath211 . in this limit the energy of the valence level @xmath212 and the _ sea _ contributions to all quantities vanish .",
    "simultaneously we take the nonrelativistic limit , i.e. we systematically neglect small components of the spinors @xmath213 . although the inertia parameters @xmath214 are infinite in this limit because of the energy denominators , their ratios to the moments of inertia @xmath215 remain finite .",

    "they get extra contributions coming from @xmath209 defined in eq.([xdef ] ) .",

    "let us stress that the agreement with the quark model results _ can not _ be obtained without the contributions of @xmath232 , which originate from the time non - locality of the fermion loop as @xmath209 .",

    "it is relatively easy to argue , as it was done in the introduction , that @xmath233 corresponds to the nonleading @xmath27 correction to the coefficient in front of @xmath234 .",

    "let us finally note that even if we discard terms proportional to @xmath209 the su(3 ) expressions , in comparison to su(2 ) , contain extra terms , as seen explicitly from eqs.([gasu23 ] ) and ( [ munsu23 ] ) . nevertheless for @xmath235 the limiting values for both su(2 ) and su(3 )",
    "do coincide .",
    "this is due to the fact that the matrix elements of the @xmath177 functions are much smaller in the case of su(3 ) and the extra terms make up for this difference , so that finally the su(2 ) and su(3 ) limiting values are the same",

    "the next - to - leading order correction of @xmath240 expansion of the rotational zero - mode of soliton , namely @xmath207 in eq.([gasu23 ] ) , is crucial to reproduce the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "moreover this correction ensures that in the limit of the small soliton our result agrees with the estimation of the naive non - relativistic quark model : @xmath241  @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig : mgp ] and [ fig : mgn ] the magnetic form factors of proton and neutron are shown .",

    "the theoretical curves are multiplied with a factor such that the values at @xmath243 agree with the corresponding experimental magnetic moments .",
    "apparently the @xmath244-dependence of the form factors is well reproduced .",
    "the theoretical magnetic moments deviate noticeably from the experimental ones , as one can see at table .",
    "this unfortunate feature is in accordance with most , if not all chiral models which notoriously have difficulties to obtain proper absolute values of the magnetic moments .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the solid curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : elp]-[fig : mgn ] correspond to the su(3 ) results truncated according to the prescription advocated in section [ smallsol ] .",
    "the differences between the results in su(2 ) and su(3 ) are very small , except the case of the neutron electric form factor , fig .",
    "[ fig : eln ] .    in the @xmath208qsm",
    "all quantities consists from two kinds of contributions .",
    "one is the valence level contribution , and the other one corresponds to the dirac sea levels .",
    "the proton electric form factor is dominated by the valence level contribution , while the neutron one is dominated by the dirac sea , which is interpreted as contribution of a mesonic cloud .",
    "the remarkable difference between su(2)- and su(3 ) calculation exists only for the neutron electric form factor and there are two possible explanations : 1 ) it might be due to a systematic error of the model . because the neutron electric form factor is quite tiny compared with the one of the proton",
    ", it is quite probable that it is sensitive to the systematic error of the model .",
    "2 ) it might be due to a kaonic excitations of the vacuum . in the su(2 )",
    "the vacuum excitation ( dirac sea polarization ) in the neutron occurs only in the @xmath245 channel . on the other hand , in the su(3 ) , it has another contribution corresponding to the @xmath246 channel .",
    "the @xmath246 excitation suppresses the @xmath245 excitation .",
    "because of that , the su(3 ) result is below the result in su(2 ) .",
    "one should also stress the sensitivity of the magnetic form factors to the tail of the soliton field .",
    "in this paper we have treated strange degrees of freedom in a purely perturbative way .",
    "one possible method which assumes strong su(3 ) breaking is given by the bound - state approach proposed by callan and klebanov in the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "we plan to investigate the neutron electric form factor with a method based on the bound - state approach to the kaon .",
    "the aim of this paper was to discuss in full extent the quantization paradox , which arises , when one applies canonical quantization rules to the rotating soliton in the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model .",
    "we have argued , that canonical quantization leads to the two type of terms , called @xmath247 , which appear due to the non - commutativity of the su(3 ) wigner functions @xmath248 and the angular velocities @xmath109 , and the non - locality of the fermion loop .",
    "these terms constitute @xmath0 corrections to the physical observables in question , and , at first sight , it seems that in the consistent treatment either both types should be simultaneously retained or neglected .",
    "however , as we have shown in full detail , quantities @xmath249 , which involve only the transitions between the states from the su(2 ) soliton subspace are theoretically harmless and phenomenologically desperately needed , whereas terms @xmath250 , which involve the transitions between the soliton states and plane waves lead to the violation of the canonical quantization rules for the flavor generators .",
    "so far no satisfactory theoretical solution of this paradox has been found .",
    "we have proposed a semi - phenomenological way , based on the requirement that the @xmath208qsm model results should agree with the non - relativistic quark model in the limit of the artificially small soliton , to circumvent the apparent contradiction and discard the @xmath250 terms .",
    "the only justification of this procedure , which we can give at the moment , is based on the fact , that the su(3 ) canonical quantization mixes different orders of @xmath0 expansion and it is a priori not clear which terms are only formally subleading , and which constitute genuine corrections to the physical quantities . we have discussed this at length in the introduction on the example of the nucleon charge , where such a distinction is easy to make .",
    "unfortunately other observables like axial couplings and magnetic moments , which we have discussed in this paper , are much more complicated , and the same kind of argument can not be straightforwardly applied in that case .    once one accepts the philosophy that @xmath249 terms should be kept as they come out from the calculations and @xmath250 terms should be discarded , a consistent picture of the su(3 ) soliton emerges .",
    "all collective operators obey proper commutation rules , and all observables have proper ( i.e. non - relativistic quark model ) limit for very small solitons .",
    "the su(2 ) and su(3 ) results coincide and the agreement with the experiment is , generally speaking , satisfactory .",
    "we felt obliged to discuss this problem without being able to give sound theoretical solution to it , since it plagues su(3 ) model calculations published in the literature .",
    "we feel that non - expert readers should be aware of this problem , with the hope that some of them may find an elegant explanation in a not distant future .",
