    "since the discovery of the nuclear modification in the nucleon structure function @xmath4 by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) @xcite , various models have been proposed to investigate the nuclear effect .",
    "several years ago , the new muon collaboration ( nmc ) @xcite accurately measured the structure functions @xmath5 at very small @xmath0 .",
    "these data as well as the emc data @xcite provide an insight for investigating the physics details in the shadowing region(@xmath6 ) .",
    "the need for testing the models of the emc effect becomes more and more important for further understanding of the nature of the nuclear effect .",
    "bickerstaff et al .",
    "@xcite found that although most of the theoretical models can provide good explanations for the emc effect , they can not describe the nuclear drell - yan process well .",
    "the nmc @xcite analyzed the inelastic @xmath7 production data and obtained the gluon distribution ratios @xmath8 which indicate a modification of the gluon distribution in the nuclear environment .",
    "kumano @xcite has made progress towards the unified description of the emc effect and the nuclear gluon distribution in the @xmath1-rescaling model with the recombination effect .",
    "although the @xmath1-rescaling model is a useful and effective model in explaining deep - inelastic data in the valence dominated medium @xmath0 region , it is not clear whether the momentum distributions of sea quarks and gluons follow the same rescaling as that for valence quarks in the nuclear environment .",
    "according to the qcd theory , sea quarks have different dynamic properties while interacting with gluons .",
    "there is a constraint condition on the number conservation for valence quarks but not for sea quarks .",
    "so it is reasonable to believe that the modification of sea quark distributions should be different from that of valence quarks . for further discussion , we assume that the transverse size of partons in a nucleon can be described by an average parton transverse momentum which is related to the longitudinal distributions of partons .",
    "the relationship between the parton transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum , which is obtained by analysing the hadron tensor in the deep inelastic scattering process , indicates that the transverse size of partons in a nucleon depends sensitively on the effective nucleon mass .",
    "the change of this transverse size gives rise to an additional parton evolution in the nuclear environment refer to the normal qcd parton evolution thus resulting in new parton distributions .",
    "the probabilities of the additional evolution are directly related to the ratio of the average parton transverse momentum in the bound nucleon to that in the free nucleon . according to these probabilities ,",
    "we give the self - consistent integral equations for parton distribution modifications due to the additional evolution in the nuclear environment .",
    "considering the fact that the nucleon diameter is about 1.8@xmath9 , in an infinite momentum frame , one can estimate that the longitudinal size of a nucleon in a lorentz contracted nucleus is    @xmath10 and the longitudinal localization size of a parton with the momentum @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "if a parton has a small @xmath0 and consequently its dimension ( @xmath13 ) exceeds the nucleon longitudinal size ( @xmath14 ) , it leaks out of the nucleon and recombines with partons of other nucleons .",
    "we suppose that the partons participating in recombination have undergone the normal qcd evolution and the additional evolution in the nuclear environment before the fusion . after considering the additional evolution in the nuclear environment with the parton recombination effects",
    ", we find that the new model can give a well explaination to the nuclear effects of the structure function , nuclear drell - yan process and inelastic @xmath7 production .",
    "finally , a quantitative comparison between the ape model and the @xmath1-rescaling model is made .",
    "partons in a free nucleon have their own distributions with a specified scale .",
    "it is generally accepted that the transverse size of partons in a nucleon is affected by the nuclear environment .",
    "we introduce an average transverse momentum to describe the change of the transverse size of partons .    in order to obtain the average transverse momentum of partons ,",
    "let us repeat the @xmath15 variable analysis @xcite of the hadron tensor @xmath16 in the deep inelastic scattering process shown in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath16 can be written as @xmath17|p \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\        & = & ( -g_{\\mu\\nu}+\\frac{q_{\\mu}q_{\\nu}}{q^2})w_1         + \\frac{1}{m_n^2}(p_{\\mu}-\\frac{p\\cdot q}{q^2}q_{\\mu } )      ( p_{\\nu}- \\frac{p \\cdot q}{q^2}q_{\\nu})w_2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the mass of a nucleon .",

    "then @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be expressed as @xmath27 @xmath28 if we take the frame in which @xmath29 and @xmath30 , then @xmath31 by means of eq.([tensor ] ) and the contractions defined by eq.([b ] ) and eq.([c ] ) , one can find the relation @xmath32 taking @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq.([b ] ) and eq.([c ] ) as those in refs.@xcite and @xcite and neglecting @xmath33 and @xmath34 terms , one easily obtains @xmath35 furthermore , we assume that there is a similar relationship between the gluon transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum distributions , i.e. , @xmath36 eq.([kq ] ) and eq.([kg ] ) with the bound nucleon effective mass @xmath37 @xmath38 have been written in a unified form for partons in both a free nucleon(n ) and a bound nucleon(a ) in a nucleus with the mass number @xmath39 .",
    "the effective mass of the bound nucleon is less than that of the free one , i.e. , in terms of eq.([kq ] ) and eq.([kg ] ) , the average transverse momentum of partons in the bound nucleon is less than that in the free nucleon , which mainly causes the parton evolution in the nuclear environment . by using the same technique in deriving the famous altarelli - parisi evolution @xcite",
    ", we obtain the evolution probabilities for the evolution from a parton with momentum fraction @xmath40 to another parton with the momentum fraction @xmath0 ; @xmath41 ln \\frac{{\\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2 ) \\rangle}^{q_j^n } } { { \\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2 ) \\rangle}^{q_j^a}}\\ ] ] @xmath42ln \\frac{{\\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2)\\rangle}^{q_j^n } } { { \\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2)\\rangle}^{q_j^a}}\\ ] ] @xmath43 ln \\frac{{\\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2)\\rangle}^{g^n } } { { \\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2)\\rangle}^{g^a}}\\ ] ] @xmath44 @xmath45   ln \\frac{{\\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2)\\rangle}^{g^n } } { { \\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x , q^2)\\rangle}^{g^a}}\\ ] ] where the strong interaction coupling constant @xmath46 is @xmath47\\ ] ] with @xmath48 and @xmath49,@xmath50 . @xmath51 and @xmath52 are color factors for @xmath53",

    "@xcite- @xcite .",
    "in fact , these equations are the self - consistent integral equations since the evolution probabilities @xmath61 contain the parton transverse momenta which are related to the parton longitudinal momentum distributions @xmath62 and @xmath63 by eq.([kq ] ) and eq.([kg ] ) . in the calculation of the parton distributions in the bound nucleon",
    ", the numerical solution of these equations is obtained by the iteration method .",
    "although the leakage in the nuclear environment can occur for all partons , the most important contribution arises from partons with the largest spatial uncertainty , i.e. , those with the small @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the leak - out partons are sea quarks and gluons for which the momentum cutoff function @xcite is taken as @xmath64 namely , the distributions of leak - out(lk ) partons are @xmath65 where the input parton distributions @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 together with @xmath73 and @xmath74 are those having undergone the normal qcd parton evolution and the additional parton evolution due to the nuclear environment .",
    "the momentum cutoff function is shown as a function of @xmath0 in fig.2 with various @xmath75 .",
    "as discussed in section 1 , the partons with @xmath76 can leak out of a nucleon .",
    "we then find in fig.2 that an appropriate choice of @xmath75 is 2.0@xmath9 .",
    "according to the original idea of the parton recombination by close , qiu and roberts @xcite , a leak - out parton can fuse with a parton from another nucleon .",
    "in general , the modification of a parton distribution @xmath77 , due to the process of producing the parton @xmath78 with the momentum @xmath79 by fusion of partons @xmath80 and @xmath81 , is given by @xcite , @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 is given by refs .",

    "although these two models seem to have the same physics origin , they have different descriptions of the nuclear effect on sea quarks and gluons . in the ape model , the evolution of valence quarks , sea quarks and gluons",
    "are determined by different interaction vertex factors , and their effects on their own momentum distributions are also different .",
    "however , the @xmath1-rescaling model , ignoring the difference in additional parton evolution modes for different kinds of partons , describes the influence of the nuclear environment on the distribution functions of valence and sea quarks by using the same @xmath1-rescaling mechanism . in the medium @xmath0 region where the valence quarks",
    "dominate , the @xmath1-rescaling model can explain the emc effect reasonably well , indicating that the nuclear effect on the valence quark momentum distribution can indeed be well described by the @xmath1-rescaling mechanism .",

    "firstly , figs.8 - 9 indicate that both models give reasonable explanations of the emc effect in the medium @xmath0 region .",
    "however , the expectations of the ratio @xmath157 for two different input distributions ( grv and duke - owens ) are almost the same in the ape model but distinctly different in the @xmath1-rescaling model in which the ratio is slightly sensitive to the choice of free parton distributions . in the lager @xmath0 region , there are distinct modifications of the recombination effect in the ratio of @xmath157 which are similar to , but different from the contributions of the nuclear fermi motion ( cf .",
    "fig.3 ) . for the small @xmath0 region",
    ", we are always seeking for some mechanisms which account for the nuclear shadowing effect .",
    "unfortunately , neither the ape model nor the @xmath1-rescaling model can give suitable explanation of the nuclear shadowing effect .",
    "it has been emphasized by ref.@xcite that the shadowing due to the recombinations in the nuclear environment is mainly produced as a result of the modification in the gluon distribution . considering this recombination effect , both the @xmath1-rescaling model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the ape model ( see fig.4 ) can fairly explain the emc and nmc shadowing data by using the kmrs - b0 input distributions .",
    "but , by using harder input gluon distributions such as those of the duke - owens(2)@xcite , the theoretical results ( see figs.8 - 9 ) of these two models underestimate the shadowing . it seems , however , that by considering the recombination effect , the prediction of nuclear shadowing in the ape model is closer to the experimental data than that in the @xmath1-rescaling model with these harder input gluon distributions .",
    "this is possibly attributed to the better descriptions of the nuclear effect on sea quarks and gluons in our model .    as for the prediction of the nuclear drell - yan ratio",

    "the results of the nuclear drell - yan ratios for other nuclei such as c , fe , w are not presented since the results are qualitatively similar .",
    "the results of these nuclear drell - yan ratios do not show a distinct nuclear dependence , which is consistent with the experimental fact .",
    "in summary , we have put forward the ape model which attempts to explain the nuclear effect on the parton distributions by the change of the transverse momentum of partons in the nuclear environment instead of the @xmath1-rescaling model . by means of the ape model with the parton recombination effect ,",
    "we investigated the nuclear effect including the nuclear structure function @xmath160 in the whole @xmath0 region , nuclear drell - yan process and nuclear gluon distribution .",
    "the results of the nuclear structure function , in the small @xmath0 region ( @xmath161 ) , are of a little @xmath1-dependence but are very sensitive to the input sea - quark and gluon distributions . by using the proper input parton distributions",
    ", we obtained reasonably good agreements with the experimental data of the emc effect , nuclear drell - yan ratio and nuclear gluon distributions .",
    "in addition , the comparison between the ape model and the @xmath1-rescaling model shows , on one hand , that the results are qualitatively similar since they have the same physics origin ; and on the other hand , with better description of the nuclear effect on sea quarks and gluons , the value of @xmath162 in the ape model is less sensitive to the choice of the free parton distributions than that of the @xmath1-rescaling model .",
    "our present investigation should be considered as the first step for seeking for more subtle mechanism with the same physics origin as the @xmath1-rescaling model but with less uncertainties .",
    "further , we are looking forward to a unified description of the nuclear effect and the nuclear shadowing within the framework of the ape model .",
