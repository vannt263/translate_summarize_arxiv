    "the precession induced by the spin - dependent force in the first arm is enhanced in the second and we observe that the detected spin variance is greatly increased relative to the @xmath196 case .",

    "the simulated histograms are scaled vertically to match the experimental data given bin widths and total detection events .",

    "as in the previous section , we assume that the phases of thermal , coherent , and odf displacements are all uncorrelated .",
    "it may seem that little can be inferred from dephasing in the presence of coherent excitations with a random phase , but we demonstrate that a constant _ magnitude _ is all that is required to distinguish such noise sources .",

    "furthermore , the large physical size of typical penning traps means a likely insensitivity to anomalous heating processes . despite these encouraging features , no measurements have yet been reported for ambient heating of a resolved motional mode of an ion crystal in a penning trap",

    "the fitted slopes reflecting @xmath222 for each curve are displayed in fig  [ heating]b and color - coded to match the corresponding data set .",
    "we measure the largest heating rate of @xmath223 s@xmath3 ( black points ) when the trap endcap electrodes are held at 0 v using the high voltage power supplies responsible for initial ion loading and transport .",
    "small voltage fluctuations from these power supplies as well as electromagnetic interference along the connecting cables are the likely cause of this com heating . upon grounding the endcaps directly to the vacuum chamber at the high - voltage feedthrough , we observe an order - of - magnitude drop in the heating rate to between @xmath224 s@xmath3 ( blue points ) and @xmath225 s@xmath3 ( red points ) .",
    "this approximate factor - of - two variation in heating rates is representative of our day - to - day observations with different ion samples , and we see no evidence of a correlation between total ion number and heating rate with the endcap electrodes grounded at the feedthrough .",
    "the mean of the two lowest heating rates corresponds to @xmath3630 mk / s , which is near previous collisional heating estimates  @xcite .",
    "additional filtering of the central ring and rotating - wall electrodes outside the vacuum envelope yielded no measurable improvement in com heating  .    because the distance from the trapped - ion arrays to the trap electrode surfaces ( @xmath2262 cm ) is large compared to the diameter of the planar array ( @xmath2270.5 cm ) , electric field noise from trap electrode surfaces will be uniform across the array and preferentially heat the com mode . for an array with @xmath60 ions this results in a linear dependence of the com heating rate on ion number due to uniform electric field noise  @xcite .",
    "the lack of an observed @xmath60-dependence in the measured ambient heating rate indicates the source of the heating is likely not electric field noise .",
    "however , any potential anomalous heating must be less than the measured @xmath3610@xmath228 s@xmath3 ambient heating rate . dividing this limit by the number of trapped ions ( @xmath229 )",
    "gives a limit on the anomalous heating rate for a single trapped ion of @xmath365 s@xmath3 at a trap frequency of 795 khz .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated a new technique for analyzing the motional state of a resolved ion crystal mode .",
    "the methods presented here do not rely on stimulated raman transitions or doppler linewidth analysis , and are in principle applicable to any resolved motional mode at any temperature provided the lamb - dicke confinement criterion is satisfied for the given mode .",
    "the sensitivity of our spin dephasing measurements allows for a regime of operation with negligible spin - motion entanglement and spontaneous emission decoherence .",
    "monte carlo simulations based on the semiclassical description of sec .  [ theory ] are in excellent agreement with spin dephasing measurements .",
    "furthermore , we observe a clear distinction between coherent and thermal states of motion , despite the randomness of the rf drive phase relative to our optical dipole force .",
    "the methods and analysis presented here enable very sensitive detection of coherently driven motion of a trapped - ion crystal , and may be used to phase - sensitively detect weak forces  @xcite .",
    "section iii can be used to estimate and optimize the force detection sensitivity for a given @xmath60 and temperature of the trapped - ion crystal .",
    "we estimate that the spin - motion coupling technique discussed here could improve on the force sensitivity obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by more than an order - of - magnitude .",
    "we also present the first measurements of ambient heating of a resolved mode of motion in a penning trap .",
    "future crystal heating measurements will include other resolved transverse motional modes with the goal of more clearly distinguishing between electric field fluctuations ( mode - specific , @xmath60-dependent ) and background gas collisions ( mode- and @xmath60-independent ) .",
