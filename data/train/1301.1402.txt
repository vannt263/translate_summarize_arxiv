    "o@xmath0has attracted significant scientific attention .",
    "since a complete summary of the relevant references on this topic exceeds the scope of the present study ( see the recent review by @xcite and references therein ) , we mention only those directly related to the problem addressed here .",
    "an experimental study of the resonant vibrational excitation of o@xmath0by the low - energy electron impact by @xcite shows oscillatory structures in the cross sections due to the @xmath1resonance .",
    "@xcite later measured the electron affinity of o@xmath0using molecular photodetachment spectroscopy .",
    "those two complementary studies @xcite provide a deeper understanding of the structure and dynamics of the @xmath1state of o@xmath2@xcite .",
    "several previously published theoretical treatments based on the _ r_-matrixmethod deal with the @xmath1resonance in the fixed - nuclei approximation @xcite .",
    "all those calculations yield the energy of the @xmath1resonance at the equilibrium geometry of o@xmath0more than 0.6ev above the value obtained from the experimental spectra @xcite .",
    "these studies are unable to reproduce the bound state of o@xmath2at larger internuclear separations without further adjustments of the _ r_-matrixpoles @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the adjusted results of the _ ab  initio_calculations to study resonant vibrational excitation by electron impact and compared the computed cross sections with the experimental work of @xcite .",
    "the resonant vibrational excitation of o@xmath0at low energies has been revisited by @xcite .",
    "their theoretical treatment of the nuclear motion is based on the `` boomerang model '' and that utilized the same adjusted positions and widths of the resonances in the fixed - nuclei approximation calculated by @xcite .",
    "the energies of the @xmath1resonance and the bound state of o@xmath2were later calculated more accurately by @xcite using the methods of quantum chemistry designed originally for bound states . however , to our knowledge , no reliable _ ab  initio_calculation exists that provides reliable scattering phase shifts at low energies ( @xmath3ev ) for different symmetries .",
    "significant scientific attention has been paid to electron collisions with o@xmath0at energies above 2ev as well .",
    "@xcite found in their study based on an extended version of multichannel effective range theory that the @xmath1resonance dominates the electronic excitation of the @xmath4and @xmath5states .",

    "the treatment of bound and continuum states of o@xmath2introduced here will be later adapted to study other symmetries of the anionic complex that are relevant to o@xmath2photodetachment and to the vibrational dynamics of that process .    in comparison with",
    "previously published _",
    "ab  initio_studies , a more physical representation of the anionic complex electronic structure studies is achieved through the use of a more advanced treatment of electron correlation and polarization in the inner region and by employing a basis set of molecular orbitals optimized for the negative ion instead of the neutral target .",
    "note that in other contexts , this idea has also proven to be beneficial @xcite .",
    "current implementations of _ ab  initio_electron - molecule scattering theory rely on expansions of the wave functions associated with both the neutral @xmath9-electron target and the @xmath10-electron system which use the same truncated basis of molecular orbitals . although orbitals optimized for the neutral target are traditionally used in molecular _ r_-matrixcalculations , it is far from obvious whether that is universally the most appropriate choice .",
    "the present study compares _",
    "r_-matrixcalculations performed using optimized neutral target molecular orbitals with those performed using optimized anionic orbitals , in order to ascertain which set is more appropriate .",
    "another goal of this study is to test the feasibility of an alternative method of calculation of the _ r_-matrixthat has the potential to treat larger basis sets and more extensive configuration interaction .",
    "the well - established approach preferred in the uk _",
    "r_-matrixcodes requires a single full diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in the inner region @xcite .",
    "the _ r_-matrixis then easily calculated for any scattering energy , since its dependence on the energy is extremely simple in the eigenrepresentation of the hamiltonian . the development of more efficient",
    "_ r_-matrixmethods capable of treating molecules having a larger number of active electrons is one of the goals driving this research direction .",
    "the requirement of a full hamiltonian diagonalization in the present implementation has made it quite challenging for the _ r_-matrixmethod to handle more complex polyatomic molecules and molecules for which electron correlation plays a key role .",
    "evaluation of all the hamiltonian matrix elements and their storing in the computer memory prior to the full diagonalization is necessary in the present implementation . that approach is computationally much more demanding than the more economical methods of the quantum chemistry of the bound states , where only a small fraction of the spectrum is calculated and the iterative methods of the diagonalization are routinely utilized .",
    "those require only evaluation the matrix elements that are used in the actual iteration .",
    "in addition , the complete set of the eigenvectors that have a dense structure is necessary in the present implementation of the _ ab  initio_molecular _ r_-matrixmethod . that further raises issues with the memory limitations .",
    "the method presented in this study employs the solution of a system of linear equations having the same dimension as the hamiltonian matrix , individually for every scattering energy .",
    "a number of other methods have previously been introduced to overcome this difficulty in solving problems requiring very large basis sets .",
    "the most promising among them is the partitioned _ r_-matrix@xcite .",
    "it consists of a single calculation of few lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian matrix and of a model - like approximation of the rest of the spectrum . while the partitioned _",
    "r_-matrixmethod retains the advantage of a single diagonalization of a ( reduced - dimensionality ) hamiltonian matrix , the alternative method presented here requires solution of the linear system of equations for every scattering energy .",
    "however , it is free of any model - like assumptions , and therefore , is a complementary approach to the partitioned _ r_-matrixmethod .",
    "it is hoped , however , that in combination with generalized quantum defect methods or multichannel effective range theory , the quantities to be calculated will be comparatively smooth functions of energy and can accordingly be calculated on a coarse energy mesh .",
    "note that the method of calculation of the _ r_-matrixby solving the system of linear equations has been formulated previously by @xcite .",
    "their linear - algebraic approach utilizes the static exchange approximation of the electron interactions in the inner region .",
    "the _ ab  initio_theoretical description of electron collisions with o@xmath0at low scattering energies is challenging .",
    "any successful treatment of the complicated polarization effects @xcite and electron correlation in the inner region requires a large basis set of configurations .",
    "depending on the details of the model , the usual approach based on the full diagonalization of the inner - region hamiltonian matrix @xcite can become intractable .",
    "that makes this system a suitable candidate to test the performance and limitations of the alternative method investigated here .",
    "as is discussed below , the linear solution method proves to be feasible and advantageous for calculations where the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix in the inner region exceeds 40000 .",
    "several different models of the target are introduced below and , where possible , the performance of the traditional full diagonalization method is compared with that of the direct linear solution method .",

    "therefore , the problem in the outer region problem can be reduced to a single scattering channel .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that neglecting the long - range interaction of the target with the incident electron in the outer region that is predominated by the polarization potential , leads to a modification of the threshold behavior of the phase shift .",
    "while the dependence of the phase shift on the momentum of the incident electron @xmath71 is is in the present results @xmath72 for @xmath73 , if the potential @xmath74 was taken into account in the outer region , this would not be the leading term in the effective range expansion @xcite .",

    "<S> electron collisions with o@xmath0at scattering energies below 1ev are studied in the fixed - nuclei approximation for a range of internuclear separations using the _ ab  initio_molecular _ r_-matrixmethod . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1scattering eigenphases and quantum defects are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the resonance and the energy of the bound negative ion are then extracted . </S>",
    "<S> different models of the target that employ molecular orbitals calculated for the neutral target are compared with models based on anionic orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> a model using a basis of anionic molecular orbitals yields physically correct results in good agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative method of calculation of the _ r_-matrixis tested , where instead of performing a single complete diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix in the inner region , the system of linear equations is solved individually for every scattering energy . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is designed to handle problems where diagonalization of an extremely large hamiltonian is numerically too demanding . </S>"
