    "problems of the form  arise in various applications , e.g. , in the analysis of wave guides and photonic crystals @xcite , in design of antennas @xcite , or particle accelerators @xcite .",
    "in all these applications the accurate and reliable simulation of the wave propagation is a key ingredient for the characterization , design , and optimization of corresponding electrical components . since the seminal work of yee @xcite , finite difference time domain methods have been investigated , extended , and applied successfully .",
    "they can be considered state - of - the art for the numerical simulation of wave propagation in engineering @xcite .",
    "these methods are second order accurate on structured grids and utilize explicit time stepping which makes them easily parallelizable and very efficient in practice .",
    "problems with non - aligned or curved boundaries and in - homogeneous materials require some non - trivial adaptions and local or implicit time stepping @xcite has to be used to preserve stability in such cases which in turn may have a significant effect on the performance of the overall method . a more flexible framework for the spatial discretization",
    "is offered by finite element methods @xcite .",
    "their underlying variational framework allows to establish rigorous convergence results for rather general situations .",
    "time dependent problems can then be treated by combination with appropriate time stepping schemes @xcite . for scattering problems and more general applications involving unbounded domains ,",
    "the boundary element method has been applied with great success , especially in the frequency domain @xcite , and more recently also for time dependent problems @xcite .",
    "an even more flexible , but still variational , approach for constructing space discretizations for maxwell s equations is offered by discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite . in principle , these methods allow to systematically couple different physical models and approximations even on hybrid and non - conforming meshes .",
    "combined with explicit runge - kutta time stepping schemes , one can obtain efficient approximations for electromagnetic wave propagation problems of formally arbitrary order @xcite . to guarantee stability of the explicit time stepping methods",

    "the treatment of locally adapted meshes therefore requires special techniques , like local or implicit time stepping , in order to keep the computational cost acceptable . using a galerkin approach not only for the discretization in space but also in time leads to space - time discontinuous galerkin methods which have been investigated for the simulation of wave propagation problems only recently @xcite .",
    "the discontinuous galerkin framework allows to obtain approximations of formally arbitrary order on locally adapted meshes in space and time .",
    "the resulting methods typically lead to implicit time stepping schemes which are absolutely and unconditionally stable and slightly dissipative .",

    "the idea to employ trefftz functions for the numerical solution of partial differential equations is well established @xcite .",
    "one particular choice for the trefftz functions consists in plane waves propagating in various directions .",

    "we will establish the consistency and well - posedness of the single time - step problem , and also prove a basic energy dissipation relation . to illustrate the stability and convergence properties of the method , we report on numerical tests in which we observe spectral accuracy and optimal approximation orders .",
    "the decision to use only the trefftz polynomials instead of the full polynomial approximation spaces yields a substantial reduction in the number of degrees of freedom on every element .",
    "in addition , the expensive computation of volume integrals can be completely avoided .",
    "this leads to a substantial reduction of the computational complexity while , at the same time , the flexibility , accuracy , and stability of the space - time discontinuous galerkin framework is preserved .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : stdg ] , we introduce our notation and present an abstract space - time discontinuous galerkin framework .",
    "we prove some general stability properties of a class of discretization schemes without specifying the approximation spaces in detail at this point . in section  [ sec : trefftz ] , we present a systematic construction of a basis for the space of trefftz polynomials , and we summarize some basic properties of these approximation spaces . in section  [ sec : stdgt ] , we present the discontinuous galerkin trefftz scheme , which results from employing piecewise polynomial trefftz functions as approximation spaces in the abstract framework of section  [ sec : stdg ] .",
    "we formulate an equivalent but more convenient form of the method , establish its well - posedness , and derive the stability and energy dissipation from the results of section  [ sec : stdg ] . in section  [ sec :",

    "our arguments easily cover also such cases .",
    "for ease of presentation , we however stick with the simple setting stated above .      without further specifying the approximation space @xmath49 , we can already derive some basic properties that any space - time discontinuous galerkin method of the above form will share .",

    "the approximations @xmath52 can therefore be computed consecutively , provided that is uniquely solvable for every time slab @xmath33 . since a linear problem has to be solved in every step , one obtains an implicit scheme .",
