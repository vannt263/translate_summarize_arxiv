    "group additive decomposition of the free energy of protein conformational change has a rich history in attempts to understand the physical factors governing protein stability in solution @xcite .",
    "such efforts are at the heart of past and current efforts to understand how the solvent modulates protein folding thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "since the peptide bond is the most numerous group in a protein , attempts to obtain the transfer free energy of the peptide group have occupied a particularly important position in the broader attempt to understand the role of the solution in protein folding thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , such group additive transfer free energy analysis has been instrumental in revealing that conformation - protecting osmolytes primarily exert their influence by changing the solubility of the peptide backbone @xcite , an identification with significant consequences to our understanding of protein folding @xcite .",
    "however , a clear theoretical analysis of the meaning of the transfer free energy of the peptide group that apparently obeys group - additivity has not been satisfactorily established . here",
    "we address this issue on the basis of a physically transparent theoretical framework and computer simulations .",
    "however , the insights from this work are not limited to a peptide group , but apply more broadly to all such group - additive decompositions of free energy that are used in studying protein folding and stability .    in seeking the contribution of the peptide , starting from the seminal work of nozaki and tanford @xcite , it is common practice to consider the transfer free energy ( typically from water to an aqueous solution of an additive ) of glycyl - peptides of increasing chain length .",
    "the peptides can be blocked n - acetylglycinamides ( as in this study ) or zwitterionic ( as in the studies by nozaki and tanford @xcite ) .",
    "the transfer free energy of the peptide group then has been sought by considering the difference in transfer free energy of chains of length @xmath6 and @xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) by various constructs ; for example , for @xmath8 , the peptide free energy would be equated with the free energy difference between the chains of length @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "a somewhat more robust approach termed the constant increment method equates the peptide transfer free energy to the slope of the transfer free energy with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "various such constructs are possible and these have been well - documented by auton and bolen @xcite .",
    "work by auton and bolen @xcite has also helped clarify some of the vexing issues related to the choice of concentration scales and model compounds in determining the peptide group transfer free energy @xcite . by careful consideration of peptide solubility issues",
    ", these authors have showed that reasonably concordant values of the peptide transfer free energy can be obtained that are independent of the concentration scale and of the model system  glycyl - peptides versus cgg , the cyclic - diglycine molecule .",
    "( for cgg , he peptide transfer free energy is sought by dividing the experimental transfer free energies by 2 . ) while this concordance is pleasing , it is also somewhat troubling since in cgg the co and nh of the peptide are _ cis _ and the molecule has a net zero dipole moment , whereas in all usual proteins the co and nh are _ trans _ and the glycyl peptides used in the experiments can have non - negligible dipole moment .",
    "further , the @xmath9 angles in cgg are also not consistent with what is found in proteins ( george rose , personal communication ) .",
    "thus , either the conformation of the peptide is unimportant in the transfer free energy value or there are other effects that lead to this result or a combination of both .",
    "concerns about group additivity @xcite , and in particular , identifying a group additive contribution for the peptide @xcite , are not new . using a continuum dielectric model of the solvent , avbelj and baldwin @xcite",
    "have argued that failure of group additivity arises due to dependence of the hydration free energy of the peptide on the neighboring groups ( that serve to occlude the solvent medium in their model ) .",
    "our point complements this , but is more broader .",
    "we show that an independent group additive contribution is not a consequence even when the conditions for use of the constant increment approach are satisfied . moreover , both electrostatics and van  der  waals ( dispersion ) interactions contribute to the failure of independence , each in rather subtle ways .",
    "thus care is needed even in decoupling free energy contributions of nonpolar groups from adjacent polar groups , an issue that had been anticipated before ref .",

    "here we use theory and computer simulations to examine the vacuum to solution ( @xmath10 ) transfer free energy of acetyl-(gly)@xmath0-methyl amide peptides and of cgg .",
    "the free energies are obtained by a quasichemical organization of the potential distribution theorem .",
    "a virtue of this formulation is that is that it makes transparent the role of correlated fluctuations of the binding energies of two groups on the molecule and its role in the thermodynamics of hydration .",
    "a central observation of our work is that even for an idealized solute with no complicated short - range solute - solvent interaction , the group - solvent binding energies between neighboring groups are correlated .",
    "this implies that identifying a group - contribution to free energy solely due to an individual group is , in principle , not possible , even for this idealized solute .",

    "our plan is to show that even for the idealized case of the conditioned solute , the effect of near - neighbor correlations is non - trivial , and hence the increment in @xmath50 $ ] with @xmath1 is not solely a measure of the contribution of the individual group .",
    "that then implies that such a group transfer quantity will depend on the model system on which it was obtained . on this basis ,",

    "our analysis shows this is , in general , invalid .",
    "in contrast to our conclusion , the studies by bolen and coworkers clearly show that the group - transfer model is capable of describing the @xmath6-value ( the unfolding free energy in an osmolyte solution minus that in water ) in a near quantitative fashion @xcite . from the perspective of vacuum to solvent transfer , the @xmath6-value is a difference of difference involving four large transfer free energy contributions ( two each for the unfolded and folded states of the protein , respectively ) and some degree of cancellation of errors can be expected .",
    "but the level of agreement between calculated- and experimental-@xmath6 value @xcite is remarkable and suggestive of some underlying physical regularity .",
    "based on the similarity of higher - order correlation contributions for the conditioned solute in different solvents , and the observed linearity of even packing and chemistry contributions ( data not shown ) , we suspect that in the @xmath6-value analysis , these higher order effects cancel , leaving only the self ( or group - additive ) contribution intact .",
    "exploring this idea further is left for future studies .",
    "group additivity has a hallowed place in chemistry ; indeed it has even been referred to as the 4@xmath55 law of thermodynamics @xcite . however , unlike a small molecular solute in the gas phase that is entirely characterized by strong , short - range interactions , in the treatment of a many body system , such as a protein in a solvent , characterized by many different scales of energies , ranging from strong , short - range interactions to relatively weak but fairly long - range interactions , group additive ideas must be considered with sufficient care .",
    "even for an idealized solute with no short - range solute - solvent interaction , we find that the net solvation free energy of the solute comprises contributions due to the correlated interaction of the solvent with distinct groups in the solute .",
    "as is intuitively reasonable , the contribution of individual group - solvent interaction to the net free energy is the most dominant .",
    "however , the binding energy of a group @xmath47 with the solvent is correlated with the binding energy of its neighbor @xmath56 , @xmath57 , etc .",
    "these correlated fluctuations can either raise or lower the free energy of the solute , and importantly , they can persist even for spatially distant groups . for the linear ( gly)@xmath58 ,",
    "correlations persist up to @xmath59 .",
    "a similar behavior , perhaps even longer - range of correlations , can be expected for a topographically complicated object .",
    "further , the individual electrostatic and dispersion contributions to the binding energies are themselves correlated , making the identification of separate free energy contributions due to polar and nonpolar groups problematic , especially if those groups are spatially close .    given that our analysis uncovers non - negligible effects of correlations even for an idealized solute with no direct solute - solvent contact , we must expect substantially more involved correlation effects for a real solute , one that has an even more complicated short - range interaction with the solvent , and for solutes with formal charges , such as charged amino acid side - chain residues . in light of this identification , the physical basis for why such additive transfer models appear successful remains to be explained .",
    "a plausible solution , suggested by this work , may rest in the similarity of the correlation contributions between different solutions .",
    "the simulation procedure closely follows our earlier work @xcite and only key differences are noted .",
