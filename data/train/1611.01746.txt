    "magnetic reconnection is an important mechanism to explain many activities and eruptions in the solar atmosphere @xcite . as the resolution of solar telescopes continue to be improved ,",
    "many tiny activities relating with magnetic reconnection in the lower solar atmosphere have been observed , _",
    "e.g. _ , chrompshere jets , ellerman bombs ( ebs ) and type ii white light flares @xcite .",
    "recently , the clear magnetic reconnection events in the low solar atmosphere have been observed by the high resolution chinese new vacuum solar telescope ( nvst ) , the current sheet structures , inflow and outflow have been clearly identified @xcite . since part of the magnetic energy is converted into plasma s thermal energy , the local temperature is increased during these magnetic reconnection processes and joule heating is usually considered to be the main mechanism to heat plasma .",
    "the compact bright points which have uv counterparts and are observed in transition region lines with the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) satellite are called iris bombs . while the temperature of the traditional ebs is only around @xmath7  k ,",
    "the temperature of the iris bombs identified in si iv slit - jaws is one magnitude higher .",
    "@xcite and show that some of the high temperature iris bombs ( @xmath6 ) are possibly due to small flaring arch filaments in the high chromosphere or transition region .",
    "however , some of them are still believed to be formed by magnetic reconnection at around the temperature minimum region or even in the photosphere .",
    "many jet - like structures are observed in the solar chromosphere . compared with corona jets , they are tiny and some with a length even less than @xmath8 and width less than @xmath9 .",
    "the life time of these micro jets could be only around one minute .",
    "the rise speed of these jets is usually in a range @xmath10  km s@xmath11 , and the temperature of the chromosphere material can be heated to higher than @xmath12  k .",
    "however , magnetic reconnection takes place at which height of the solar chromosphere and where the high temperature plasmas are generated in the chromosphere jets are still not clear .",
    "since the density stratification is strong in the chromosphere layer , the plasma density at the top of chromosphere is around 6 magnitudes lower than that at the bottom of the chromosphere @xcite . the plasma is weakly ionized at the bottom of the chromosphere , but the plasma is almost fully ionized at the top .",
    "therefore , the dominate physical mechanisms in the magnetic reconnection process could vary with height from the bottom to the top of the chromosphere .",
    "the numerical results by @xcite demonstrate that the recombination is the main effect to cause fast magnetic reconnection in the up chromosphere .",
    "our latest paper @xcite verifies that the plasmoid instability is very important to lead to fast magnetic reconnection at around the middle of the chromosphere , where the neutral - ion collisional mean free path is smaller than the critical width of the current sheet for secondary islands appearing .",
    "the speeds of reconnection out flows are in the range of observed speeds of jets in solar chromosphere .",
    "most of the previous numerical simulations which focus on the formations of ebs , chromosphere jets and micro - flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are studied based on the single fluid mhd equations with an assumed anomalous resistivity .",
    "the topology structures and many characteristics in these numerical simulations can match well with the observation results .",
    "for example , the numerical results in the paper by @xcite , and @xcite show that the temperature enhancement for ebs is around several thousands kelvin and the lifetime is around several minutes , which are similar as the observation results of ebs . by setting suitable initial magnetic fields and plasma density",
    ", the numerical simulations can lead to the formation of chromosphere jets which have similar topology structures as from the observations , the up - flow speeds from the simulations can be in the range around @xmath13  km@xmath11 , which are the same as the speeds of the observed chromosphere jets .",
    "on the other hand , some numerical simulations focus more on the physical mechanisms of magnetic reconnection in solar chromosphere , the partially ionized effects including ambipolar diffusion and recombination have been studied detailedly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , with an initial temperature as low as several thousand kelvin , the temperature of the plasma in these chromosphere magnetic reconnection simulations has never been increased by more than one order of magnitude because of high plamsa @xmath3 @xcite or low numerical resolutions .    in our latest paper@xcite ,",
    "magnetic reconnection in the middle of the chromosphere ( @xmath14  km above the solar surface ) has been studied carefully .",
    "the numerical results in the paper indicate that the initial low temperature plasma ( @xmath15  k ) can be heated to above @xmath4  k by multiple internal slow - mode shocks in the plasmoids inside the current sheet region . in this work",
    ", we have built a more realistic model to study the magnetic reconnection in the lower chromosphere ( around @xmath2 km above the solar surface ) .",
    "the more realistic density stratification , radiation cooling , heating , anisotropic heat conduction and ambipolar diffusion effects are all included . by analyzing the numerical simulation results",
    ", we attempt to find out the possible physical mechanism for heating plasma to a high temperature in the lower solar chromosphere / photosphere .",
    "the initial conditions and numerical model are described in section ii .",
    "we present our numerical results in section iii .",
    "section iv provides a short conclusion and discussion .",
    "as demonstrated in our latest paper , the single - fluid mhd equations can be used if the collisional coupling between ions and neutrals is strong , which is valid on length - scales exceeding the neutral - ion collisional mean free path @xmath16 . in the lower chromosphere ,",
    "the coupling of ions and neutrals is even stronger than that in the middle of the chromosphere . according to the initial physical parameters in all the cases given below",
    ", we can calculate and find that the current sheet width for onset of the plasmoid instability is several orders of magnitude above @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the onset and evolution of plasmoid instability in this part of the solar atmosphere can generally be described using the one - fluid equations as below :    @xmath17   \\nonumber \\\\                                & & + \\nabla \\cdot \\left[\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 } \\mathbf{b } \\mathbf{b } \\right ] + \\rho \\mathbf{g } \\\\",

    "according to the paper by @xcite , the conductivity coefficient @xmath39 is contributed partially by neutral particles and partially by the charged particles .",
    "however , the conductivity coefficient contributed by charged particles is strongly suppressed in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field . in this work , we build a conductivity coefficient model according the results presented in figure.1 in the paper by @xcite . the parallel and perpendicular conductivity coefficient",
    "are assumed as below    @xmath40    the term @xmath41 is contributed by the charged particles and @xmath42 is contributed by neutral particles . during the range for @xmath43",
    "k @xmath44  k , the charged particles dominate and the first term is much larger than the second term at the right hand side of equation ( 11 ) . in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ,",
    "the term contributed by charged particles is totally modified and it is much smaller than the one contributed by neutral particles .",
    "therefore , we only include the term @xmath42 in equation ( 12 ) .",
    "many papers show that the transverse magnetic fields in the photosphere could also be very strong .",
    "the observational and numerical results indicate that the vertical and horizontal current sheet structures can both possibly be formed in the low solar atmosphere @xcite . in this work , we present our simulation results in five cases .",
    "the horizontal current sheets without gravity and density stratification have been studied in case  i , case  ii and case  iia .",
    "one should note that the solar surface is spherical , though the current sheet is horizontal to the solar surface , the bi - directional flows with blue - red shift as suggested by observations can still possibly be observed as long as the current sheet is far from the center of the solar surface . according to the val - c chromosphere model @xcite , case  i can represent a magnetic reconnection process at around 600  km above the solar surface , and the current sheets in case  ii and case  iia are at even lower places ( about 250  km above the solar surface ) . the vertical current sheets with density stratification have been studied in case  iii and case  iiia , which are located at around @xmath45  km above the solar surface .",
    "the important initial parameters and conditions in all the five cases are listed below in table .  1 and in the following subsections .",

    "@xmath46  m. convergence studies have been carried out by repeating the simulations with both a lower and a higher resolution to make sure that the numerical diffusion is smaller than the physical magnetic diffusion .",
    "we ignore the density stratification effect in case  i , ii and iia , because the width of the horizontal current sheet in our simulations is much shorter than the length .",
    "the simulation domain extends from @xmath47 to @xmath48 in @xmath49 direction and from @xmath50 to @xmath51 in @xmath52 direction in the three cases , with @xmath53  m. outflow boundary conditions are used in @xmath49 direction and inflow boundary conditions in @xmath52 direction . for the inflow boundary conditions ,",

    "the maximum of the field strength was found to be @xmath56  t. the magnetic field could be even stronger in the active region near the sunspot .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath57  t in case  i and case  ii , and @xmath58  t in case  iia .",
    "due to the force - freeness and neglect of gravity , the initial equilibrium thermal pressure is uniform .",

    "the forms of perturbations are listed as below : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the initial alfvn velocity , @xmath78 is the random noise function in our code , and @xmath79 is the maximum of the absolute value of the random noise function .",
    "this random noise function makes the initial perturbations for velocity in y - direction to be asymmetric , and such an asymmetry makes the current sheet gradually to become more tilted , especially after secondary islands appear .",
    "reconnection process is not really symmetrical in nature @xcite , this is one of the reasons that we use such an noise function .",
    "another reason is that the asymmetric noise function makes the secondary instabilities to develop faster .",

    "secondary islands start to appear , it increases sharply and the maximum temperature exceeds @xmath12  k in case  i. the first panel of figure  4 shows the distributions of current density and magnetic fields at @xmath96 in case  i. one can see that different sizes of plasmoids appear , the bigger islands are usually formed by coalescence of smaller islands . in order to see more details inside the plasmoids , we zoom into a small scale as shown in the second panel of figure  4 .",

    "many different sizes of slow - mode shocks are found at the edges of different sizes of plasmoids .",
    "the fourth panel of figure  4 shows the distributions of the mach number , one can find that the maximum mach number is above 2 , which indicates that the strong fast mode shocks are formed below these high mach number regions .",
    "we use the same method as @xcite to calculate the mach number , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the local sound speed , @xmath99 is the local alfvn speed .",

    "only @xmath116 of the generated thermal energy is contributed by joule heating during this period and this domain .",

    "therefore , we only analyze the level 6 idl data to get the plots in figure  6(a ) and the energy by joule heating could be underestimated .",
    "however , we have zoomed in to several much smaller regions to calculate the joule heating during a fixed period by using the highest resolution , and we still find that the joule heating is much lower than the total generated thermal energy as long as the shocks are included in these small regions .",

    "therefore , we can conclude that joule heating is the main physical mechanism to generate thermal energy in case .",
    "the initial plasma density and temperature in case  iia is the same as those in case  ii , but the initial magnetic fields set in case  iia is three times higher than that in case  ii . as shown in figure  3(c ) and figure  7 , the maximum temperature can exceed @xmath127  k in case  ii after the secondary islands appear .",
    "the slow - mode and fast - mode shocks also dominate for generating thermal energy in case  iia .    as described in section  ii , case  i can represent a magnetic reconnection process at around 600  km above the solar surface , and the current sheets in case  ii and case  iia are at even lower places ( about 250  km above the solar surface ) .",
    "the magnetic fields must be strong enough for heating plasma to high temperatures in such a high plasma density and low temperature environment .",

    "if the magnetic fields are weak and the plasma @xmath3 is high , the temperature in a magnetic reconnection process can only be increased for several thousand kelvin , joule heating is the main mechanism for heating plasma .",

    "the light blue arrows in this figure represent the velocity distributions of plasma . as shown in the first panel of figure  3(d ) , we can see both the up flows and down flows at @xmath130 in the reconnection region before secondary islands appear .",

    "one can expect that the maximum temperature will be increased to an higher value for an even lower plasma @xmath3 case .",
    "the slow - mode and fast - mode shocks present at the edges of the well developed plasmoids inside the current sheet regions are the main mechanisms to heat plasma and generate the high temperature explosions .",
    "\\(2 ) the low temperature events ( @xmath1  k ) are formed in a magnetic reconnection process with high plasma @xmath3 and weak magnetic fields in the low solar atmosphere .",
    "joule heating is the main mechanism to heat plasma and the temperature increases are at most only several thousand kelvin .",
    "the maximum temperature can only reach around @xmath122  k in a horizontal current sheet with @xmath57  t , @xmath143  m@xmath61 , @xmath62  k and @xmath144 .",
    "the plasma @xmath3 in the low temperature events is larger than @xmath145 and at least one magnitude higher than that in the high temperature hot explosions ( @xmath6  k ) .",
    "\\(3 ) gravity in the low solar atmosphere can strongly hinder the plasmoind instability and the formation of slow - mode shocks in a vertical current sheet .",
    "only small secondary islands are formed ; these islands , however , are not well developed as those in the horizontal current sheets and no higher order plasmoids are formed .",
    "the up - flow speed in the simulation domain decreases with time because of gravity .",
    "for the first time , our numerical simulations show that the plasma can be heated from @xmath146  k to exceed @xmath12  k in a magnetic reconnection process in the low chromosphere at around the temperature minimum region .",
    "these results can be applied for understanding the heating mechanisms in the low solar atmosphere through reconnection at current sheets .",
    "our work could possibly be extended to explain the formation of common low temperature ebs ( @xmath1  k ) and the high temperature iris bombs ( @xmath6  k ) in the future .",
    "however , the ionization non - equilibrium effect is not included in the simulations . since the hydrogen gas will be totally ionized as the temperature reaches @xmath12  k , the ionization process for the hydrogen gas will consume a lot of thermal energy .",
    "this effect will generally decrease the temperature of the hot plasmas . in the paper by @xcite , they have studied magnetic reconnection processes in the low solar atmosphere by including the ionization non - equilibrium and the temperature increases in their simulations are only several thousand kelvin . however , we should point out that the assumed anomalous resistivity is large and the resolutions are low in their work . therefore , the secondary plasmoid instabilities associated with many small scale shock structures are not resolved in their paper . on the other hand , the initial magnetic fields set in their simulations are around one magnitude lower than those in our simulations .",
    "these two factors are probably the main reasons to cause the high temperature plasmas to be not generated in their simulations .",
    "we only use the simple harris sheet magnetic structures to study the magnetic reconnection process .",
    "the observed eb like and iris bomb events have more complicated structures for magnetic fields . for the further studies , we plan to use the two - fluid mhd model for including the ionization non - equilibrium effect , and the more realistic magnetic structures in a reconnection event will be applied in our future work .",
