    "ever since the suggestion of optically induced lattices in photorefractive media such as strontium barium niobate ( sbn ) in @xcite , and its experimental realization in @xcite , there has been an explosive growth in the area of nonlinear waves and solitons in periodic lattices . a stunning array of structures has been predicted and experimentally obtained in lattices induced with a self - focusing nonlinearity , including ( but not limited to ) discrete dipole @xcite , quadrupole @xcite , necklace @xcite and other multi - pulse patterns ( such as e.g. soliton stripes @xcite ) , discrete vortices @xcite , and rotary solitons @xcite . such structures have a potential to be used as carriers and conduits for data transmission and processing , in the context of all - optical schemes .",
    "a recent review of this direction can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "many of these studies in induced lattices were also triggered by the pioneering work done in fabricated algaas waveguide arrays @xcite . in the latter setting a multiplicity of phenomena such as discrete diffraction , peierls barriers , diffraction management @xcite and gap solitons @xcite among others @xcite were experimentally obtained .",
    "these phenomena , in turn , triggered a tremendous increase also on the theoretical side of the number of studies addressing such effectively discrete media ; see e.g. @xcite for a number of relevant reviews .",
    "finally , yet another area where such considerations and structures are relevant is that of soft - condensed matter physics , where droplets of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) may be trapped in an ( egg - carton ) two - dimensional optical lattice potential @xcite .",
    "the latter field has also experienced a huge growth over the past few years , including the prediction and manifestation of modulational instabilities @xcite , the observation of gap solitons @xcite and landau - zener tunneling @xcite among many other salient features ; reviews of the theoretical and experimental findings in this area have also been recently appeared in @xcite .    in light of all the above activity , it is interesting to note that the only structure that has been experimentally observed in two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices in `` defocusing '' media consists of self - trapped `` bright '' wave packets ( so - called `` staggered '' or gap solitons ) excited in the vicinity of the edge of the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "however more complex coherent structures have not yet been explored in lattices with defocusing nonlinearity and their stability properties have not yet been examined , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "it should be mentioned that the defocusing context is accessible in the aforementioned settings .",
    "e.g. , in the photorefractive lattices , this can be done by appropriate reversal of the applied voltage to the relevant crystal , while in becs , the defocusing nonlinearity corresponds to the most typical case arising in dilute gases of @xmath0rb or @xmath1na .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to examine the non - fundamental soliton structures ( e.g. , dipoles , multipoles , and vortices ) in lattices with a defocusing nonlinearity , and to illustrate the similarities and differences in comparison to their counterparts in the focusing case . in particular , we study dipole structures ( consisting of two peaks ) and quadrupole structures ( featuring four peaks ) , as well as vortices of topological charge @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in a 2d induced lattice with a defocusing nonlinearity .",
    "these structures will be analyzed in detail for both cases , namely , the `` on - site '' excitation ( where the center of the structure is on an empty lattice site between the excited ones ) and the `` inter - site '' excitation ( where their center is between two lattice sites and no empty lattice site exists between the excited ones ) .    our study of these structures will be conducted analytically and numerically ( in the next two sections ) in the context of the most prototypical generic envelope lattice model , the so - called discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation with a defocusing nonlinearity @xcite which is related to all of the above contexts @xcite .",
    "when we find the relevant structures to be unstable , we will also briefly address the dynamical evolution of the instability , through appropriately crafted numerical experiments .",
    "finally , in the last section , we will summarize our findings and present our conclusions , and the interesting experimental manifestations that they suggest .",
    "as our generic envelope model encompassing the main features of discrete diffraction and defocusing nonlinearity we use the two - dimensional ( 2d ) dnls equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a complex amplitude of the electromagnetic wave in nonlinear optics @xcite , or the bec wave function at the nodes of a deep 2d optical lattice @xcite ; @xmath5 is the ( two - dimensional in the present study ) vector lattice index , and @xmath6 the standard discrete laplacian .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 is the constant of the intersite coupling ( associated with the interwell `` tunnelling rate '' @xcite ) , and the overdot stands for the derivative with respect to the evolution variable , which can be @xmath8 in optical waveguide arrays , or the time @xmath9 in the bec model .",
    "we focus on standing - wave solutions of the form @xmath10 , with @xmath11 satisfying the equation , @xmath12 perturbing around the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ steady ] ) gives rise to the linearization operator @xmath13 with the overbar denoting complex conjugation . through an appropriate rescaling of the equation ,",
    "we can fix @xmath14 .",
    "our analysis uses as a starting point the so - called anti - continuum limit , i.e. , the case of @xmath15 , where for the uncoupled sites , @xmath16 with the amplitude @xmath17 being @xmath18 or @xmath19 , and the phase @xmath20 being an arbitrary constant .",
    "continuation of such a solution to nontrivial couplings necessitates that a certain , so - called lyapunov - schmidt condition be satisfied @xcite .",
    "the latter imposes for the projection of eigenvectors of the kernel of @xmath21 onto the system of stationary equations to be vanishing .",
    "this solvability condition provides a nontrivial constraint at every `` excited '' ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) site of the ac limit , namely : @xmath23 it is interesting ( and crucial for stability purposes ) to note that this equation has an extra @xmath24 sign in comparison to its focusing counterpart .",
    "the derivation of these solvability conditions is especially important because the corresponding jacobian @xmath25 has eigenvalues @xmath26 that are directly related to the `` regular '' eigenvalues of the linearization problem @xmath27 , through the equation @xmath28 hence , the method that we use to derive the eigenvalues @xmath29 ( which fully determine the crucial issue of stability of the solution for small @xmath30 ) consists of a perturbative expansion of the solution from the ac limit @xmath31 which allows us to derive the principal bifurcation conditions for a specific configuration and therefore infer its linear stability properties through the eigenvalues of @xmath32 and their connection to the linearization eigenvalues @xmath29 .",
    "recall that a nonzero real part of _ any _ eigenvalue is a necessary and sufficient condition for an exponential instability in hamiltonian systems , such as the one considered herein .",
    "we start with some general terminology that we will use in this section .",
    "the designation in - phase ( ip ) will be used for two sites such that their relative phase difference is @xmath18 , while out - of - phase ( op ) will signify that it is @xmath33 . furthermore , on - site ( os ) will mean that the center of the configuration is on an empty lattice site ( between the excited ones ) , while inter - site ( is ) will signify that the center is located between the excited lattice sites ( and no empty site exists between them ) .",
    "for all modes , in the figures below , we show their power latexmath:[$p=\\sum    @xmath30 , as well as the real and imaginary parts of the key eigenvalues ( the ones determining the stability of the configuration ) .",
    "we start with the dipole configuration ( consisting primarily of two lattice sites ; see figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig1c ] ) .",
    "we also examine the more complex quadrupole ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig2c ] ) and vortex ( see figs . [ fig3]-[fig3a ] ) configurations . in all the cases ,",
    "we offer typical examples of the mode profiles and stability for select values of @xmath30 .",
    "when the configurations are found to be unstable , we also give a typical example of the instability evolution , for a relevant value of the coupling strength .",
    "another general feature that applies to all modes is a continuous spectrum band extending for @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "this latter trait significantly affects the stability intervals of the structures in comparison with their focusing counterparts as we will see also below ( since configurations may be stable for small @xmath30 , but not for larger @xmath30 ) .",
    "the presentation of the figures will be uniform throughout the manuscript in that in each pair of figures , we examine two types of configurations ( one in the left column and one in the right column ) .",
    "the first figure of each pair will have five panels showing @xmath36 as a function of @xmath30 , the principal real eigenvalues ( second panel ) and imaginary eigenvalues ( third panel ) .",
    "in these plots , the numerical results are shown by the solid ( blue ) line , while the analytical results by the dashed ( red ) line .",
    "the fourth and fifth panels show typical examples of the relevant configuration ( obtained through a fixed point iteration of the newton type ) and its stability eigenvalues ( shown through the spectral plane @xmath37 for the eigenvalues @xmath38 ) .",
    "the accompanying second figure will show the result of a typical evolution of an unstable mode , perturbed by a random perturbation of amplitude @xmath39 , in order to accelerate the instability evolution .",
    "the four contour plot panels ( one set on the left and one on the right ) will display the solution s squared absolute value for four different values of the evolution variable ; the bottom panel will show the dynamical evolution of the sites chiefly `` participating '' in the solution .",
    "a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme has been used for the numerical integration results presented herein .    to facilitate the reader ,",
    "a summary of the results , encompassing our main findings reported below is offered in table 1 .",
    "the table summarizes the configurations considered , their linear stability and the outcome of their dynamical evolution for appropriate initial conditions in the instability regime .",
    "note that if the solutions are unstable for all @xmath30 , they are denoted as such , while if they are partially stable for a range of coupling strengths , their interval of stability is explicitly mentioned .",
    "details of our analytical results and their connection / comparison with the numerical findings are offered in the rest of this section .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -0.7 cm      finally , figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig3a ] show similar features , but now for the is ( left panels ) and os ( right panels ) vortex solutions @xcite .",
    "the former has a theoretically predicted double pair of eigenvalues @xmath40 leading to an instability upon collision with the continuum band for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 theoretically ) . in this case , there is also an eigenvalue of higher order @xmath43 which obviously depends more weakly on @xmath30 .",
    "the fourth and fifth panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show the real and the imaginary parts of the vortex configuration for @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the sixth panel the corresponding spectral planes .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the vortex of topological charge @xmath2 , for @xmath46 is shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] , indicating that the vortex also , upon the occurrence of the oscillatory instability , becomes a single - site solitary wave .",
    "on the other hand , the os vortices are shown in the right panels of figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig3a ] . in this case",
    ", we theoretically find that the vortex , for small @xmath30 , should have a double pair of eigenvalues @xmath47 and a single , higher order pair of eigenvalues @xmath48 the former eigenvalue pairs , upon collision with the continuous spectrum , lead to an instability , theoretically predicted to occur at @xmath46 and numerically found to happen for @xmath49 .",
    "the on - site mode ( and its stability ) is shown in the fourth - sixth right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "its evolution ( for @xmath46 ) is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] , where it is again seen that the mode degenerates from an @xmath2 to an @xmath50 structure , i.e. , a single - site solitary wave with no topological charge .",
    "it is interesting to note as an over - arching conclusion that the stability intervals of the defocusing structures are different from those of their focusing counterparts ( especially when they are stable close to the ac limit ) because of the collisions with the continuous spectrum band edge ; the latter is at @xmath51 in the focusing case , while it is at @xmath52 in the defocusing setting .",
    "another similarly general note is an immediate inference on whether the structures are stable or not ; this can be made based on the knowledge of whether their focusing counterparts are stable or not and the transformation from the former to the latter through the staggering transform : @xmath53 .",
    "for instance , ip two - site configurations ( both os and is ) are known to be generically unstable in the focusing regime @xcite ; through the staggering transformation , os - ip of the focusing case remains os - ip in the defocusing , while is - ip of the focusing becomes is - op in the defocusing .",
    "hence , these two should be expected to be always unstable , while the remaining two ( os - op in both focusing and defocusing and is - op of the focusing , which becomes is - ip in the defocusing ) should similarly be expected to be linearly stable close to the ac - limit , as is indeed observed .",
    "notice that , interestingly enough , for the vortex states the staggering transformation indicates that the stability is not modified between the focusing and defocusing cases .",
    "this is because for an is vortex , it transforms an @xmath2 state into an @xmath54 state ( which is equivalent to the former , in terms of stability properties ) , while the os vortex remains unchanged by the transformation .",
    "however , as mentioned above , these considerations are not sufficient to compute the instability thresholds for initially stable modes , among other things .",
    "they do , nonetheless , provide a guiding principle for inferring the near - ac limit stability of the defocusing staggered states , based on their focusing counterparts .",
    "in this paper , we have studied in detail some of the principal multi - site solitary wave structures that emerge in the context of defocusing nonlinearities , examining , in particular , dipole , quadrupole and vortex configurations .",
    "we have illustrated which ones among these states can potentially be stable ( e.g. is - ip and os - op for both dipoles and quadrupoles , as well as the vortices ) and those that will _ always _ be unstable ( e.g. is - op and os - ip modes for both dipoles and quadrupoles ) .",
    "we have also provided detailed analytical estimates of the stability eigenvalues associated with these modes , in very good agreement with the observed numerical results .",
    "the analytical calculations also empower us to identify , even for the stable ( close to the ac - limit ) modes , the relevant intervals of stability of those waveforms .",
    "we have corroborated our analytical calculations with detailed computations that identify the corresponding modes and numerically analyze their linear stability . in addition , for each of the modes , we have shown some typical examples of their dynamical evolution , when they become unstable ( either directly , or subsequently due to eigenvalue collisions ) .",
    "these results offer immediate suggestions for experiments in arrays of optical waveguides , bose - einstein condensates ( e.g. of @xmath0rb or @xmath1na , which feature repulsive interactions amounting , at the mean - field level , to a defocusing nonlinearity ) mounted on a deep optical lattice . in the latter case",
    ", the nodes of the lattice considered herein would correspond to bec droplets in the respective wells of the optical potential . finally , they are also suggestive of similar experiments in the recently and rapidly growing theme of photorefractive crystal lattices ( where , however , the nonlinearity is slightly different , featuring a saturable form ) .",
    "we close by suggesting that these results also indicate that higher charge configurations @xcite may similarly be possible and could potentially also be stable in a defocusing setting , similarly to the @xmath2 states discussed above .",
    "it would certrainly be of interest to examine such states in the near future , as well as to study the effect of additional components @xcite ( i.e. , multi - component states , relevant to the above optical settings when multiple polarizations are present , or to becs when multiple hyperfine states are studied ) , or that of higher - dimensional structures @xcite .",
