    "these developments excite the imagination because they seem to bring us closer to the possible discovery of extraterrestrial life .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether microlensing searches are likely to find planets on which life could thrive .",
    "we do not yet have a clear enough understanding of the nature of life to definitively answer this question , because the range of physical conditions compatible with life may well be wider than our limited experience would at first suggest",
    ". it has been proposed , for example , that life may exist on the outer planets of our own solar system and/or on their moons .",

    "1983 ; raulin _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; sagan , thompson , & khare 1992 ; williams , kasting , & wade 1997 , mccord _ et al .",
    "it has even been postulated that life may exist in non - planetary environments , including the interiors of stars and molecular clouds ( see , e.g. , feinberg & shapiro 1980 ) .",
    "it therefore makes sense to consider any planet , however close to or far from its star , and whatever the nature of the star , as a possible harbor for life .    nevertheless , in the absence of real information on the existence of life away from our own planet , one question is clearly interesting : will microlensing find evidence of planets similar to earth ?",
    "we must of course define what we mean by  similar to earth \" .",
    "if we mean that there is a chance that chemical processes necessary for earth - like life could occur , then we want to consider planets which can have similar surface and atmospheric make - up , and similar amounts of energy available to fuel the necessary chemical processes .",
    "the range of planetary masses and distances from a solar - type star compatible with earth - like conditions , particularly the presence of liquid water , has been dubbed the  goldilocks problem \" , and has been studied by many researchers .",
    "( see , e.g. , rampino & caldeira 1994 , for an overview . )    in linking the goldilocks problem to microlensing  observations , we must focus on the properties of ps .",
    "s that determine their detectability when searched for by microlensing  monitoring programs .",
    " 2 is therefore devoted to a brief overview of the detection of planets via microlensing . the question of whether planets discovered through their action as microlenses may be earth - like , is addressed in  3 .",
    "one of the primary findings of this study is that when a planet discovered via microlensingreceives from its central star  a flux of radiation comparable to that received by the earth from the sun , the central star  will generally be more luminous than our sun .",
    "this means that light from the lensed star will be blended with light from the ps . .",
    " 4 is devoted to studying how blending ( a ) influences the detection of , and ( b ) helps us develop strategies to study ps .",
    "s discovered through microlensing . in  5 ,",
    "i summarize the conclusions .",
    "the detection of a planet   via microlensing  is possible if the separation between the star and planet  is close to or larger than the einstein radius , @xmath1 of the star : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the stellar mass , @xmath4 is the distance to the lensed source , and @xmath5 is the ratio of the distance to the lens to @xmath4 . consider lensing by a mass , @xmath6 .",
    "define @xmath7 to be the time taken for the track of a lensed star to cross a distance in the lens plane equal to the einstein diameter , @xmath8 .",
    "note that the duration of the observable event  generally differs from @xmath7 for several reasons .",
    "first , if the photometric sensitivity is good , the event  may be detectable well before the track of the source comes within @xmath9 of the lens position .",
    "for example , the deviation from baseline is at the @xmath10 level , when the projected separation between the source and lens is @xmath11 second , the track of the source will not generally intersect the lens position . finally , blending may decrease and/or finite - source size effects may increase the time during which the event  is detectable .",
    "( see distefano  1998 ; distefano  & scalzo 1997 or 1998a for discussions relevant to planet  lenses . )",
    "express the separation between the planet and star as @xmath12 .",
    "the minimum possible value of @xmath13 for which planets can be discovered via microlensing  is @xmath14 ( gould & loeb 1992 , but see wambsganss 1997 for a detailed discussion ) . for planets located between roughly @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( the _ zone for resonant lensing _ ) , the signature of a lensing planet  is a short - lived perturbation superposed on a light curve whose underlying structure is due to lensing by the ps .",
    "the time duration of the underlying event may be weeks or months .",
    "all of the literature published to date on planet discovery via microlensing  has been limited to the possible discovery of planets in the zone for resonant lensing , and observing programs designed to increase the detection efficiencies for these types of events are already underway . for a more detailed description of these short - duration ,  resonant \" perturbations , and a discussion of the boundaries of zone for resonant lensing  see , e.g. , mao & paczyski 1991 , gould & loeb 1992 , bennett & rhie 1996 , paczyski 1996 , wambsganss 1997 , peale 1997 .",
    "the benefits of systematically extending the search , to look for planets located farther from the central star , have recently begun to be explored ( distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998a , b , distefano  1998 ) . for larger values of @xmath17 ,",
    "the planet  generally acts as an independent lens .",
    "when the planet  is the only lens , then the event  will be an isolated event  of short - duration .",
    "( for a jupiter - mass planet , e.g. , the time duration of the perturbation from baseline lasts @xmath18 of the time the deviation due to a solar - mass star would . )",
    "when the track of the source passes through the lensing region of one planet  and also that of another system mass ( typically the central star ) , the event will appear to repeat ( distefano  & mao 1996 , distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998a , b ) .",
    "there is no maximum value of @xmath13 , other than that dictated by the dynamics of the ps .",
    "itself  i.e . ,",
    "planets located too far from the central starmay be lost from the system . because the probability of a repeating event  falls off as @xmath19 , where @xmath17 is the orbital separation , while the probability of isolated short - duration  events is nearly independent of position ( and actually increases at the expense of repeating events as the orbital separation increases ) , isolated short - duration  events become the dominant mode of detection for planets in wider orbits  particularly since ps .",
    "s may have several planets in s ( distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998a ) .",
    "calculations indicate that it is likely that microlensing  by planets in s will provide an important channel and , for low - mass ( e.g. , earth - mass ) planets , possibly the dominant channel for planet  detection via microlensing  ( distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998a , b distefano  1998 ) .",
    "the phrase  earth - like conditions \" does not have a unique meaning .",
    "two requirements seem natural , however .",
    "( 1 ) the radiation flux received from the central star  should be neither too large nor too small ; ( 2 ) the planet  should have a rocky surface , water , and a gaseous atmosphere .      for earth - like conditions to exist , the primary requirement on @xmath20 the orbital separation between the planet  and the central star , is that the incident flux of radiation from the star should be comparable to the flux received by the earth from the sun .",
    "that is , @xmath21 , should not be too different from unity .",
    "@xmath22 the mass and luminosity of the central star are @xmath3 and @xmath23 , respectively . as usual , @xmath4 ( @xmath24 )",
    "is the distance to the lensed source ( lens ) , and @xmath25 .    given that ( 1 ) the conditions that lead to life may be flexible , ( 2 ) the effects of radiation incident from the star are likely to be strongly influenced ( either enhanced or diminished ) by the planet s atmosphere , and ( 3 ) internal heating from geological processes or radioactive materials may be important , it is not clear how large a range of values of @xmath21 may be compatible with the development of life .",
    "we will therefore simply use @xmath26 as a guideline , and emphasize that this should not be viewed as an absolute requirement .",
    "figure 1 shows the relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath5 for those systems that satisfy the relationship @xmath27 we have set @xmath28 and have assumed that @xmath29 in the upper plot , and @xmath30 in the bottom plot ; the former would be appropriate for main - sequence stars , while the latter would be appropriate for slightly evolved stars . as eq",
    ".  1 and figure 1 make clear , if the planets we will discover via microlensing are to have incident flux comparable to the flux incident on earth , their stars will generally ( although not necessarily ) be more luminous than our sun .",
    "this has two obvious implications .",
    "the first is that the length of time during which the planet would have this flux incident will be shorter than the time to date that the earth has had roughly this flux incident .",
    "this is because the system s star may need to be more massive than the sun , or even slightly evolved .",
    "the time elapsed from the formation of the star until the present time could range from less than @xmath31 the present age of the sun to times comparable to the sun s main - sequence lifetime .",
    "we do not know how long it takes for complex life forms to develop , but it may be that the process is fast enough that intelligent life can develop and thrive during a time significantly shorter than the present age of the sun . indeed , it is likely that a long sequence of independent processes must occur in order for intelligent life to develop ; thus , the probability distribution may well be log normal , and the likelihood of intelligent life developing in times much shorter than the time apparently taken on earth may be significant .",
    "the second implication is that , since the central star must be fairly luminous , it may contribute a non - negligible fraction of the light incident along the line of sight to the lensed source ; i.e. , the light we receive may be strongly blended .",
    "we may also argue , as follows , that planets likely to be deemed earth - like have masses within a factor of @xmath0 of the mass of the earth . assuming that we would like a rocky surface",
    ", we also assume that the planet s average density should be similar to that of earth .",
    "this means that the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath32 , scales as the cubed root of the planet s mass , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , @xmath32 will be within a factor of 2.5 of @xmath34",
    "(= 9.8 m / s@xmath35 ) if @xmath33 is within a factor of 15 of @xmath36 . increasing or decreasing the value of @xmath32 will lead to different atmospheric contents ; for any given atmospheric temperature , there is a lower limit to @xmath33 ( hence @xmath32 ) , below which an atmosphere will not be retained .",
    "additional ( and more sophisticated ) considerations can influence these limits .",
    "for example , the level of geothermal ( planetary - thermal ) activity may be less for planets of smaller mass , influencing atmospheric chemistry .",
    "in fact , it has been conjectured that part of the difference between earth and mars , which is roughly @xmath37 times less massive than earth , could be related to differences in planetary - thermal activity related to their mass difference .",
    "but it is not clear that this is the crucial difference with regard to liquid water , for example , and other possibilities exist .",
    "( see , e.g. , rampino & caldeira 1994 . )    in this paper , however , i will not highlight such complementary restrictions .",
    "this is because the main relevance of such considerations to microlensing  observations is simply that there is likely to be a range of planet masses , possibly spanning two orders of magnitude , consistent with earth - like conditions .",
    "this means that event  durations for earth - like planets are likely to also have a range .",
    "the factor of @xmath38 derived above corresponds to a range of event durations from less than an hour to more than a day .",
    "in addition , finite - source - size effects could increase the time duration of events by a factor of a few ( distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998a , distefano  1998 ) .",
    "if the central star of a ps .",
    "that serves as a lens is fairly luminous , then its light will blend with that from the lensed star .",
    "this blending can have two consequences .",
    "first , if is is measurable and can be quantified , blending makes it possible to learn more about the lens system : the spectral type of the central star  can be determined and , in some cases , even the mass of the planetmay be inferred ( distefano  1998 ) . unfortunately , however , the second consequence of blending is that the peak magnification , or in some cases , the time interval during which the event  is observable , may be decreased to the point that the planet - lens event  is not detected at all",
    ". we must distinguish between the detection of planets in the zone for resonant lensing , and the detection of planets in wider orbits .",
    "the discussion below applies to cases in which the orbital separation is outside the zone for resonant lensing , when the planet  acts as a more - or - less independent lens . at the end of  4.1 we return to the case of planets in the zone for resonant lensing .",
    "let @xmath39 represent the fraction of the baseline flux contributed by the lensed star . when the central star of the ps",
    ". is luminous , particularly if its flux comes close to satisfying the criterion studied in the last section ( @xmath40 ) , then @xmath39 can indeed be small enough for the effects of blending to be measurable .",
    "if , for example , the apparent @xmath41 magnitude of the combined light coming along the line of sight from a lensing event  is [ @xmath42 , then @xmath43 if the lens is located in the bulge and is a main - sequence star of mass roughly equal to [ @xmath44 @xmath45 . a small value of @xmath39 can allow us to reliably determine the effects of blending and to thereby learn more about the lens .",
    "the question we address below is whether values of @xmath39 small enough to be useful may prevent the event  from being detected .",
    "( woniak & paczyski 1997 ) . in the latter case , however , evidence of blending can be obtained through comparisons of spectra taken at peak with spectra taken at baseline ( unless the lens and source are of similar spectral type ) .",
    "astrometry can also be useful ( see , e.g. , goldberg 1988 , goldberg & wozniak 1998 ) . ]      when light from the lensed source is blended with light from other sources , the observed magnification , @xmath46 is smaller than the true magnification , @xmath47 @xmath48 thus , in order for a light curve  perturbation to be brought above the detection limit , @xmath49 must be larger than it would otherwise have to be , the projected distance between the source and lens must be smaller , and the event  will consequently appear to have a shorter . to describe this effect systematically ,",
    "distefano  & esin ( 1995 ) introduced the  blended einstein radius \" , @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the minimum peak magnification  needed for event  detection .",
    "define the  of each event  to be time during which the magnificationwas greater than @xmath52 the expression for the blended einstein radius is then @xmath53 figure 2 illustrates the influence of blending on event  as a function of both @xmath51 and @xmath54 for a given value of @xmath55 the event  is longer if @xmath51 is smaller .",
    "thus , increasing the photometric sensitivity to accomodate smaller values of @xmath51 should increase the detection rate . note that if @xmath51 is @xmath56 then even if @xmath57 the event  ( which would have been @xmath58 ) , is reduced by only a factor of @xmath59 to @xmath60 thus , while blending does tend to decrease the event  , making more frequent monitoring  desirable , we can expect to be able to detect a large majority of events by using sensitive photometry .",
    "note , however , that , even with @xmath61 the time  of an event  with @xmath62 would be decreased by only a factor of @xmath63 . if @xmath51 could be reduced to @xmath64a formidable task for a large - scale monitoring  program",
    " then for @xmath65 an event  that would have lasted for @xmath66 will have an observed  of @xmath60    there has not been a detailed study of the effects of blending on the detection of planets in the zone for resonant lensing .",
    "we can make some general observations , however .",
    "blending does decrease the duration of stellar - lens events . since we expect most such events to last for times on the order of weeks or months",
    ", the arguments above show that it is unlikely that blending will cause us to miss the stellar - lens event  altogether . what blending can do , though , is to shorten the event  in such a way that we become aware of it only after the planet - lens perturbation has occurred , if the perturbation takes place early in the event .",
    "perturbations can take place early in stellar - lens events ( paczyski 1996 , wambsganss 1997   to @xmath67 . ] ) .",
    "thus , one effect of blending is to decrease the rate of observable resonant planet - lens events .",
    "the effect should not be large , however , because ( 1 ) the events that occur early are not generally the most distinctive and readily observed planet - lens events , and ( 2 ) careful monitoring , once we know the stellar - lens event  is underway , can help us to catch even perturbations that take place as the measured flux declines toward baseline , so that we suffer the worst losses only on the upswing of the magnification .",
    "the second effect of blendingis to alter the light curve  shape .",
    "when , however , finite - source - size effectsare unimportant , the spike in magnification  associated with resonant events is so distinctive that frequent monitoring of the light curve  during the event should allow us to detect it .",
    "the remaining challenge is therefore to estimate the combined effects of finite - source size and blending on the overall efficiency of detecting planets in the zone for resonant lensing .",
    "the up - side of blending is that the quantity and color of light from the central star  are themselves valuable pieces of information about the ps . .",
    "thus , if the blending is significant enough to make these features measurable , it allows us to learn something interesting about the ps . .",
    "we would like to do the following .",
    "\\(1 ) definitively establish that there is blending .",
    "\\(2 ) establish that the light not emanating from the lensed source is most likely emitted by the central star  of the ps . .",
    "this establishes that , even if the event  was an isolated event  of short - duration , the lens was a ps . .",
    "\\(3 ) determine the spectral type , and possibly the mass of the central star . in cases",
    "in which the mass ratio can be extracted from the light curve , this will establish the mass of the planet lens .",
    "if , in addition to blending , there are measurable finite - source - size effects , then the mass of any planets that served as lenses may be determined directly .",
    "these possibilities , together with the combined effects of blending and finite - source - size effects  on event  detection , are discussed in more detail elsewhere ( distefano  1998 ) , since they apply to all ps . s discovered via microlensing , not just those most likely to include an earth - like planet . here",
    "i simply note that a combination of observations would generally be needed to accomplish these goals .",
    "these include : light curve  studies to begin to assess the role of blending and finite - source - size effects ; possible astrometric studies ( e.g. , goldberg 1988 , goldberg & wozniak 1998 , boden , shao , & van buren 1998 , dominik & sahu 1998 , mao & witt 1998 ) ; spectra taken near peak magnification , compared with spectra taken at baseline , to determine the spectral type and radius of the lensed star ; and high - spatial - resolution follow - up observations to determine whether any light not emanating from the lensed star can be explained by a chance superposition of light from other stars in the field .",
    "microlensing searches for planets complement other types of searches .",
    "they have the advantage of probing vast volumes of space , and of providing information about the existence of planets in diverse stellar environments .",
    "an additional advantage is that microlensingcan discover low - velocity planets .",
    "because they are far away , however , planets discovered via microlensing  are less amenable to detailed follow - up observations . in this paper",
    "i have shown that microlensing  is a tool that can discover distant planets with earth - like conditions , should such planets exist .",
    "in addition , i find that , among planets discovered by microlensing  surveys , those likely to be experiencing earth - like conditions are particularly good targets for some follow - up studies .",
    "this is because the central star  of these ps .",
    "s may be luminous enough that the blending of its light with light from the lensed source may be detectable and quantifiable . through a combination of spectra taken during the event , high resolution images and spectra taken after the event , and light curve  fitting",
    ", we may be able to determine the spectral classification of the central star , the distance of the ps .  from us , and even , in some cases , the mass of the planet  lens .",
    "( see also distefano  1998 . )",
    "although there may be a subset of such events that are rendered undetectable by the very blending that helps to make them potentially so interesting , the results presented here show that in most cases , the planet - lens events should be detectable .    until now ,",
    "microlensing  discussions of earth - like planets have intrinsically focused on earth - mass plants .",
    "in addition , because ( 1 ) low - mass stellar lenses are almost certainly significantly more numerous than higher - mass stars , and ( 2 ) a larger value of the mass ratio between the planet  and star is preferred for detection , it has become common for calculations to focus on a low - mass ( @xmath68 ) star orbited by an earth - mass planet .",
    "figure 1 indicates , however , that it is unlikely that a low mass star will harbor a planet  with earth - like conditions that can be discovered via microlensing .",
    "furthermore , the considerations in  3.2 indicate that there may be room for more flexibility in the mass of planets with earth - like conditions than has been assumed so far .",
    "simple arguments indicate that the range could extend as much as a factor of ten above , and a factor of 10 below the mass of the earth .",
    "finally , it is important to note that we should consider the possibility that microlensing  ( whether by resonant or wide planets ) is most likely to discover the outer planets in a system that may contain closer planets experiencing earth - like conditions . in this case , the microlensing  events serve as beacons directing us to the ps . .",
    "in the near - term , such discoveries can contribute to developing the statistics of distant ps .",
    "s , such as the frequency of planets as a function of spectral type and the spatial distribution of planets around stars . in the far ( and so far unforeseeable ) future",
    ", astronomers with instruments capable of measuring the spectra of distant stars and detecting small - amplitude doppler effects can perhaps check these ps .",
    "s for the presence of planets in orbits smaller than those occupied by the planets discovered via microlensing .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the referee , scott gaudi , for suggested changes to an earlier manuscript ( distefano  & scalzo 1998b ) that contained much of this work ; his suggestions have helped to improve the presentation .",
