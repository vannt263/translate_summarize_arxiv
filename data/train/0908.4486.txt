    "exactly _ masses of odd , odd - odd and even - even nuclei is warranted by the hohenberg - kohn  @xcite and kohn - sham  @xcite ( hks ) theorems .",
    "the hks theorems , however , provide no universal rules underlying the construction of such functional .",
    "the complexity of the functional and our lack of knowledge with respect to the in - medium strong interaction that governs the structure of finite nuclei make the situation even more difficult .",
    "it does not permit the determination for any _ ab initio _ constraints of the nuclear edf , except for dilute neutron systems  @xcite .",
    "it forces us to use effective functionals with coupling constants fitted directly to the data .",
    "hence , a proper selection of empirical data to be used in the  process of constraining parameters of the functional becomes , irrespective of the form of functional , the  key issue for the overall good performance of the nuclear density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite .",
    "the typical strategy used to construct the nuclear edf is to start with either the finite - range gogny  @xcite or zero - range skyrme  @xcite effective interactions and construct non - local or local functional , respectively , by averaging the interaction within the hartree - fock ( hf ) method .",
    "the datasets used to adjust the free parameters of the theory are dominated by bulk nuclear matter data and by nuclear binding energies of selected doubly magic nuclei with much lesser attention paid to the single - particle energies ( spe ) .",
    "the major reason is the effective mass scaling of the single - particle ( sp ) level density , @xmath9 , in the vicinity of the fermi energy , @xmath10 .",
    "in homogeneous nuclear matter the sp level density scales according to the simple rule : @xmath11 . in finite nuclei the situation is slightly more intricate mostly due to @xmath12-dependence of the @xmath13 .",
    "several authors  @xcite analyzed the sp level density scaling arguing that the physical density of sp levels around the fermi energy can be restituted only after the inclusion of particle - vibration coupling , i.e. , by going beyond mean - field ( mf ) .",
    "this viewpoint is difficult to reconcile with the effective edf theories .",
    "indeed , these theories should warrant a  proper value of the effective mass through the fit to empirical data and readjust other coupling constants to this value of @xmath14 .",
    "this should lead to fairly @xmath14 independent predictions , provided that the ( spherical ) spe are calculated from the differences between the binding energies in even - even doubly - magic cores and the lowest sp states in odd-@xmath15 single - particle / hole neighbors . within the edf approach , the mean - field or , more precisely , kohn - sham sp energies computed in e - e doubly magic core serve only as auxiliary quantities .    a new strategy for fitting the spin - orbit (",
    "so ) and tensor parts of the nuclear edf was recently suggested by our group  @xcite . instead of performing large - scale fits to binding energies we proposed a simple and intuitive three - step procedure that can be used to fit the isoscalar strength of the so interaction as well as the isoscalar and isovector strengths of the tensor interaction .",
    "the entire idea is based on the observation that the @xmath16 so splittings in spin - saturated isoscalar @xmath1ca , spin - unsaturated isoscalar @xmath2ni , and spin - unsaturated isovector @xmath3ca form distinct pattern that can neither be understood nor reproduced based solely on the conventional so interaction . following the general philosophy of the nuclear dft we compute the @xmath16 so splittings from the differences between the binding energies of these doubly - magic cores and their odd-@xmath15 neighbors .",
    "however , we use the same functional to calculate both the ground state energies , what is well justified , as well as the low - lying sp excitations in the odd-@xmath15 neighbors .",
    "how reasonable is the latter assumption it remains to be studied .",
    "the procedure reveals the need for a sizable reduction ( from @xmath1720% up to @xmath1735% depending on the parameterization and , in particular , on the value of @xmath14 ) of the so strength and at the same time , for much stronger tensor fields as compared to the commonly used values .",
    "the new parameterization systematically improves the performance of the functional with respect to sp properties like the so splittings or the magic gaps but deteriorates the binding energies  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to address further consequences of strong attractive tensor and weak so fields on binding energies , time - even and time - odd polarization effects , and the nuclear deformability .",

    "[ sec2 ] we briefly present the theoretical background of our model . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we show that the contribution to the binding energy due to the tensor interaction forms a generic pattern closely resembling that of the shell - correction with the _ tensorial magic numbers _ shifted up as compared to the standard magic numbers toward @xmath4=14 , 32 , 56 , or 90 .",
    "the tensorial magic numbers reflect the maximum spin - asymmetry in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath18 , and @xmath8 configurations , respectively , in the extreme sp scenario at spherical shape .",
    "the tensorial magic structure is smeared out by configuration mixing caused by pairing and deformation effects . in sect .",

    "hence , nuclear deformability in the presence of strong attractive tensor fields and reduced so potential poses very stringent test for this new class of functionals .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that deformation properties indeed depend sensitively on the balance between the so and tensor fields .",
    "we will discuss two contrasting cases .",
    "first , we will consider an example of the yrast superdeformed ( sd ) band in @xmath2ni  @xcite . the band is formed by promoting two protons and two neutrons from the @xmath143 to the @xmath91 orbital or , in terms of more appropriate from mean - field point of view asymptotic nilsson model quantum numbers , from @xmath1637/2 $ ] to @xmath1643/2 $ ] nilsson orbital as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ 56ni]a .    in the spherical ground state of @xmath2ni the entire @xmath143 is fully occupied while the @xmath91 is empty .",
    "this creates large spin - asymmetry and , in turn , large contribution to the ground state due to the tensor field . by promoting four - particles from the @xmath143 to the @xmath91 orbit one creates the sd state which has reduced spin - asymmetry as compared to the ground state .",
    "the reduced tensor field shifts the sd state up in energy with respect to the ground state .",
    "the subsequent reduction of the so potential shifts the @xmath91 orbit and , in turn , the entire sd band down in energy .",
    "this compensating mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 56ni]b , c , d .",
    "the figures show the results of the self - consistent quadrupole - constrained hf calculations for the ground state ( gs ) and the sd configurations . since it is impossible to go diabatically through the gs  sd configuration crossing region the self - consistent results for the gs and sd configurations",
    "were , for the sake of simplicity and clarity , extrapolated diabatically through this region .",
    "this does not affect the physics discussed below .",
    "[ 56ni]b shows the calculations performed using the conventional sko force .",
    "these calculations predict the @xmath165 sd state to be excited by @xmath174mev with respect to the gs what agrees quite well with the empirical estimate  @xcite .",
    "readjustment of the tensor coupling constant in the sko to the value characteristic for the sko@xmath166 functional ( this functional is called sko@xmath167 ) shifts the position of the @xmath165 sd state by 4mev up in energy .",
    "this intermediate step is illustrated in fig .",
    "the change in the tensor field on the passage from the gs to the sd minimum is shown in fig .",
    "[ 56ni]e . finally , fig .",
    "[ 56ni]d shows the result obtained using full sko@xmath166 functional .",
    "the effects of the reduced so and strong attractive tensor fields almost cancel each other restoring the position of the @xmath165 sd state close to its empirical ( and close to the sko ) value .     and sko@xmath137 results , respectively .",
    "note , that tensor field tends to favor strongly elongated shapes leading to well deformed absolute minimum .",
    "the subsequent reduction of the so strength , however , shifts the entire potential energy curve up in energy close to its original sko position . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the second example is shown in fig .",
    "the figure illustrates potential energy curves in @xmath168zr calculated using the hfb model with volume - delta interaction , @xmath169 , of the strength @xmath170=-190mev in the particle - particle channel .",
    "the three curves represent the sko , sko@xmath167 , and sko@xmath137 functionals in the particle - hole channel .",
    "all curves are normalized to the spherical minimum in order to facilitate further discussion .    unlike the @xmath2ni , the @xmath168zr is spin - saturated in the spherical minimum .",
    "building up deformation is associated in this nucleus with partial occupation of the @xmath171 sub - shell .",
    "it leads to increasing spin asymmetry and , in turn , to extra attraction due to the tensor terms .",
    "this effect is clearly visible for the sko@xmath167 functional , see fig .",
    "the mechanism is strong enough to create a well deformed minimum . in this case ,",
    "reduction of the so strength shifts the @xmath171 sub - shell up with respect to the negative parity @xmath172 levels . in turn",
    ", the well deformed minimum is also lifted up in energy ending up slightly higher as compared to the sko prediction .",
    "these two examples show that the sko@xmath137 functional have deformation properties quite similar to the conventional skyrme functionals at least in isoscalar @xmath173 nuclei .",
    "the situation is slightly more intricate in the isovector channel due to the uncertainties of the @xmath174 strength and , in turn , in the @xmath175 coupling constant .",
    "nevertheless , the two cases analyzed above clearly show that :    * nuclear deformation properties strongly depend on the  balance between tensor and spin - orbit terms * detailed and systematic studies of nuclear deformation in the  presence of strong tensor fields open up new , promising venue which may help to tune the effective tensor coupling constants @xmath95 .",
    "* there is a  large , and so far completely unexplored , potential to modify deformation properties by extending the tensor term from the uniform form used here to the non - uniform form ( [ nonuni ] ) .",
    "* possible modifications of collective rotational motion , which is inherently related to the spontaneous breaking of spherical symmetry within the edf formalism , opens up yet another almost completely unexplored area in studying tensor fields .",
    "the direct fit of the isoscalar spin - orbit and both isoscalar and isovector tensor coupling constants to the @xmath0 so splittings in @xmath1ca , @xmath2ni , and @xmath3ca requires ( _ i _ ) a drastic reduction of the isoscalar so strength and ( _ ii _ ) strong attractive tensor coupling constants  @xcite . in this work",
    "we address the global nuclear structure consequences of this novel fitting strategy of the nuclear edf . among others ,",
    "we show that contribution to the nuclear binding energy due to the tensor field shows generic _ magic structure _ with the _ tensorial magic numbers _ at @xmath4=14 , 32 , 56 , or 90 corresponding to the maximum spin - asymmetries in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 single - particle configurations and that these numbers are smeared out by pairing correlations and deformation effects .",
    "we explicitly construct the functional , dubbed sko@xmath137 , which is able to reproduce simultaneously the @xmath0 so splittings in @xmath1ca , @xmath2ni , and @xmath3ca nuclei and the binding energies of spherical nuclei .",
    "in fact , one can construct many parameterizations reproducing these data in a  more or less equivalent manner .",
    "this is due to the fact that multi - dimensional merit - functions which are minimized in the fitting process are flat in certain directions and the entire minimization procedure is not well - defined",
    ". reasonable performance on the binding energies of the sko@xmath137 functional which is characterized by its non - conventional isovector so term is very interesting by itself .",
    "indeed , this result may open up a possibility to bridge the @xmath176 and @xmath177 coupling constants resulting from ( local ) fits to the spe with the values resulting from global large - scale fits to the binding energies by exploring non - standard local functionals .    using the sko@xmath137 functional we analyze polarization effects exerted by one particle and one hole on the values of the @xmath0 so splittings .",
    "we show that the polarization effects are large and very sensitive to the way the functional is set up in the time - odd channel .",
    "fits to the landau parameters are uncertain due to rather poorly known @xmath151-wave landau parameters . in particular , the use of the @xmath151-wave landau parameters deduced from the gogny force , which is advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , leads to strong gauge - symmetry violating effects and , in turn , large differences in the @xmath178 coupling constants between the gauge - invariant sko@xmath147 functional and the gauge - symmetry violating functional sko@xmath148 .",
    "we also demonstrate that deformation properties in atomic nuclei can be easily and strongly modified in the presence of strong tensor fields and that these properties are extremely sensitive to the  balance between the tensor and the so coupling constants .",
    "we show that , in the  particular case of the sko@xmath137 functional , the tensor effects are almost perfectly compensated , at least in the isoscalar channel , by the reduced so potential .",
    "we suggest that the role of the tensor interaction , in particular in the time - odd channel , can be studied through dynamical effects induced by fast nuclear rotation . for this purpose",
    "one needs to select and use nuclear states representing , as close as possible , an unperturbed single - particle motion in order to suppress other effects or correlations which may obscure the analysis .",
