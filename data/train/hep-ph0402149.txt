    "in order to investigate higgs boson production via @xmath0 higgs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one needs to account for multi - parton radiation for the sake of performing trustworthy phenomenological analyses @xcite .",
    "standard monte carlo ( mc ) algorithms @xcite@xcite describe parton radiation in the soft and/or collinear approximation of the parton shower ( ps ) , but can have regions of phase space , so - called ` dead zones ' , where no radiation is allowed . here , one can however rely on higher - order tree - level results , as in this region the radiation is neither softly nor collinearly enhanced .",
    "several methods have been recently suggested in order to match ps and fixed - order matrix elements ( mes ) @xcite , also including the virtual one - loop terms @xcite@xcite .",
    "in this note , we briefly mention that the same strategy which has already been used to implement real me corrections to @xmath1 annihilation into quark pairs @xcite , deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xcite , top quark decay @xcite and vector boson hadroproduction @xcite has now also been adopted for the case of higgs hadroproduction via gluon - gluon fusion and quark - antiquark annihilation @xcite , in the context of the herwig event generator @xcite",
    ". that is , the dead zone is here populated by using the exact next - to - leading order ( nlo ) tree - level me result and the ps in the already - populated region is corrected using the exact amplitude any time an emission is capable of being the _ hardest so far_.",
    "the mes squared for the real corrections to @xmath2 that we have used can be found in @xcite , where top mass effects are fully included .",
    "the real nlo corrections to @xmath3 are instead rather straightforward : the formulae we used can be read from eq .",
    "( 3.62 ) of @xcite with appropriate yukawa couplings and crossing . in the new herwig default version , in line with @xcite , me",
    "corrections use the higgs transverse mass @xmath4 as the scale for @xmath5 and for the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) while the @xmath6 contributions use @xmath7 .",
    "we shall also assume that the intrinsic transverse momentum of the initial - state partons is equal to @xmath8 , the herwig default value .    by adopting the herwig defaults ,",
    "we first consider higgs production at the tevatron and the lhc within the mc itself , by plotting the @xmath9 distribution with ( solid histogram ) and without ( dotted ) me corrections : see fig .",
    "[ hw ] . beyond @xmath10",
    "the me - corrected version allows for many more events .",
    "in fact , one can prove that , within the standard algorithm , @xmath9 is constrained to be @xmath11 . at small @xmath9 the prediction which includes me corrections displays a suppression . by default , after the latter are put in place , the total normalization still equals the lo rates .",
    "hence , it is obvious that the enhancement at large @xmath9 implies a reduction of the number of events which are generated at small @xmath9 values .    in fig .",
    "[ comparisons ] ( left plot ) we present the improved herwig spectrum ( solid ) for the lhc , along with the result obtained running the so - called ` @xmath12 + jets ' process ( dotted ) , where the hard process is always one of the corrections to @xmath2 . in order to perform such a comparison ,",
    "we have turned the @xmath3 hard process off , as ` @xmath12 + jets ' in herwig does not currently implement the corrections to quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "furthermore , we have chosen @xmath13  gev for the ` @xmath12 + jets ' generation .",
    "as expected , at small @xmath9 the two predictions are fairly different but at large transverse momentum they agree well .    in fig .",
    "[ comparisons ] ( centre plot ) we compare the new herwig version with the resummed calculation of ref .  @xcite . for the sake of comparison with herwig , which includes leading logarithms and only some subleading terms , we use the results of @xcite in the nll approximation ( rather than the default nnll one ) , matched to the nlo prediction . in order for such a comparison to be trustworthy",
    ", we have to make parameter choices similar to @xcite : namely , we adopt a top quark with infinite mass in the loop and @xmath14  gev , with @xmath5 and pdfs ( both from herwig defaults ) evaluated at @xmath7 . while the normalization ( lo in herwig , nlo in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the small-@xmath9 behaviour of the two curves are clearly different , the large transverse momentum predictions are in good agreement , as in both approaches it is the real nlo me that dominates the event generation at large @xmath9 .    finally , in fig .  [ comparisons ]",
    "( right plot ) , we compare the results of standard herwig after me corrections with the so - called ` mc@nlo ' event generator ( version 2.2 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter implementing both real and virtual corrections to the hard - scattering process , in such a way that predicted observables ( including normalization ) are correct to nlo accuracy . as version 2.2 of the mc@nlo includes only the corrections to higgs production in the gluon - fusion channel , we again have turned the quark - annihilation process off in our routines . as observed in the comparison with the resummed calculation ,",
    "the two spectra differ in normalization and at small @xmath9 , but agree in the large - transverse - momentum region .",
    "between the described implementation and the one available within the mc@nlo option , we believe that herwig is presently a reliable event generator for ( direct ) higgs production from parton fusion at hadron colliders both at small and large transverse momentum .",
    "in fact , all currently available me corrections will play an important role to perform any analysis on higgs searches at present and future colliders .",
    "in particular , the option described here may be the most convenient choice for when the phase space is limited to transverse momentum values such that @xmath15 .",
