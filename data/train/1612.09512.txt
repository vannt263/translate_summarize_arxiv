    "the quantum circuit must be independent of the input state , which is presumed to be unknown .",
    "eq .   can be viewed as an idealization of the frequently occurring physical scenario where a quantum system evolves jointly with a large external environment in a manner where information dissipates from the system into the environment . in quantum information",
    "theoretic terms , lindblad evolution is a continuous - time process that , for any evolution time , is a quantum channel .",
    "moreover , lindblad evolution is _ markovian _ in the sense that , for any @xmath8 , the state at time @xmath9 is a function of the state at time @xmath1 alone ( i.e. , is independent of the state before time  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the lindblad evolution can be intuitively thought of as hamiltonian evolution in a larger system that includes an ancilla register , but where the ancilla register is being continually reset to its initial state . to make this more precise ,",
    "consider a time interval @xmath10 $ ] , and divide it into @xmath11 subintervals of length @xmath12 each . at the beginning of each subinterval , reset the state of the ancilla register to its initial state , and then let the joint system - ancilla evolve under a hamiltonian @xmath13 and the system itself evolve under @xmath6 .",

    "this converges to lindblad evolution as @xmath18 .",
    "[ fig : lindblad - as - unitary],scaledwidth=95.0% ]    for the specific evolution described by eq .  , it suffices to set the ancilla register to @xmath19 and the hamiltonian @xmath13 to the block matrix @xmath20    a remarkable property of this way of representing lindblad evolution is that the rate at which the hamiltonian @xmath13 evolves is effectively infinite : lindblad evolution for time @xmath15 is simulated by a process that includes evolution by @xmath13 for time @xmath14 , so the rate of the evolution scales as @xmath21 which diverges as @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the total hamiltonian evolution time of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lindblad - as - unitary ] is @xmath22 , which also diverges . in appendix  [",

    "[ fig : lindblad - as - unitary ] . in this sense , _ exact _ lindblad evolution for finite time does not directly correspond to hamiltonian evolution for _ any _ finite time . on the other hand , it can be shown that if the scaling of @xmath11 is at least @xmath23 then the final state is an _ approximation _ within @xmath2 .",
    "note that then the corresponding total evolution time for @xmath13 scales as @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , quantum algorithms that simulate lindblad evolution by first applying the above reduction to hamiltonian evolution and then efficiently simulating the hamiltonian evolution are likely to incur scaling that is at least @xmath25 .",

    "we expect some of the methodologies in  @xcite to be adaptable to the lindblad evolution simulation problem ( in conjunction with our variant of the lcu construction and oblivious amplitude amplification ) , but have not investigated this .",
    "as noted in subsection  [ sec : previous ] , for the case of hamiltonian evolution , a series of recent quantum algorithms whose scaling is @xmath26 have been discovered which improve on what has been accomplished using the longstanding trotter - suzuki decomposition .",
    "one of the main tools that these algorithms employ is a remarkable circuit construction that is based on a certain decomposition of _ unitary _ operations ( or _ near - unitary _ operations ) into a linear combination of unitaries .",
    "we refer to this construction as the _ standard lcu method_.    for the case of lindblad evolution , the operations that arise are _ channels _ that are not generally unitary .",
    "some channels are _ mixed unitary _ , which means that they can be expressed as a randomly chosen unitary ( say with probabilities @xmath87 on the unitaries @xmath88 ) . for such channels ,",
    "the standard lcu method can be adapted along the lines of first randomly sampling @xmath89 and then applying the standard lcu method to the unitary @xmath90 . however , there exist channels that are _ not _ mixed unitary  and such channels can arise from the lindblad equation .",
    "a different reductionist approach is to express these channels in the stinespring form , as unitary operations that act on a larger system , and then apply the standard lcu method to _ those _ unitaries ; however , as we explain in subection  [ section : standard - lcu ] , this approach performs poorly .",
    "we take a different approach that does not involve a reduction to the unitary case : we have developed a new variant of the lcu method that is for channels .",
    "this is explained in section  [ sec : new - lcu ] .",
    "another new technique that we employ is an oblivious amplitude amplification algorithm for isometries ( as opposed to unitaries ) , which is noteworthy because a reductionist approach based on extending isometries to unitaries does not work . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is because our lcu construction turns out to produce an isometry ( corresponding to a purification of the channel ) ; however , it does not produce a unitary extension of that isometry .",

    "a stinespring dilation of @xmath91 and its lcu decomposition can be derived from the above lcu decompositions of @xmath109 and @xmath110 as @xmath111 applying the standard lcu method here results in a success probability ( computed from eq .  ) of @xmath112 for small time evolution @xmath1",
    ", the failure probability is @xmath113 , which is prohibitively expensive .",
    "it means that the process can be repeated at most @xmath114 times until the cumulative failure probability becomes a constant .",
    "the amount of evolution time ( of the amplitude damping process ) that this corresponds to is @xmath115 which is subconstant as @xmath116 .",
    "this creates a problem in the general lindblad simulation .",
    "our new lcu method for channels ( explained in section  [ sec : new - lcu ] ) achieves the higher success probability @xmath117 for small time evolution @xmath1 , the failure probability is @xmath118 .",
    "now , the process can be repeated @xmath119 times until the cumulative failure probability becomes a constant , which corresponds to evolution time @xmath120 which is constant as @xmath116 .",
    "since this is consistent with what arises in the algorithm of simulating hamiltonian evolution in  @xcite , the methodologies used therein , with various adjustments , can be used to obtain the simulation bounds .",

    "we first consider the case where @xmath286 .",
    "the quantum circuit is based on the oblivious amplitude amplification operator @xmath250 , whose correctness is shown by lemma [ lemma : oaa ] .",
