    "the study of quantum phase transitions is a hot topic covering different branches of quantum many - body physics . in recent years",
    ", the study of low - dimensional lattice models has been triggered by the increasing interest on the development of a quantum computer .",
    "moreover , concepts of quantum information have been used to characterize quantum critical phenomena . on a different respect ,",
    "there is a revival of the study of structural changes in finite - size systems where precursors of the transitions could be observed @xcite . in atomic nuclei , the interacting boson model ( ibm )",
    "@xcite provides a framework simple but still detailed in which first and second order phase transitions can be studied .",
    "in fact , the transition from the spherical @xmath0 dynamical symmetry to the deformed @xmath1-unstable @xmath2 dynamical symmetry has been extensively studied in the last few years @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian describing this transition is a repulsive boson pairing hamiltonian that has the particularity of being exactly solvable allowing the study of very large systems .",
    "the boson pairing model was first solved by richardson @xcite and more recently applied to the ibm @xcite . however",
    ", this is the only integrable line in the phase diagram of the ibm often described with the q - consistent hamiltonian ( qch ) @xcite and pictorially represented by the casten triangle .",
    "this integrable line corresponds to one side of the triangle .",
    "therefore , the interior area of the triangle as well as the other two sides are out of reach of large scale numerical studies .",
    "numerical calculations in these cases are then limited by the number of bosons that standard ibm codes can manage , which are of the order of @xmath3 bosons .",
    "however , strictly speaking quantum phase transitions only occur in macroscopic systems .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to be able to extend previous analysis in the casten triangle to a significant larger number of bosons .    in this paper , we introduce a simple two - level boson model depending on two control parameters , that leads to the same energy surface as the q - consistent ibm hamiltonian when the @xmath1 degree of freedom is frozen at @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "both energy surfaces coincide if axial symmetry is imposed in the ibm treatment .",
    "this model can be solved for very large boson numbers and it allows us to investigate the properties of the first - order phase transition from spherical to deformed axial shapes in the ibm .",
    "the two - level boson model can be viewed as a generalized lipkin model with parity breaking terms , as a two coupled large spin system @xcite or as a model to study tunnelling dynamics between two minima @xcite .    in sect .",
    "ii , after a brief presentation of the model , we derive its energy surface . next , in sect .",
    "iii we compute the finite - size corrections up to order @xmath5 in the spherical phase which allows us to discuss the finite - size behaviour at the critical point for different quantities such as the ground state energy , the gap , and the order parameter .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "iv is for summarizing .",
    "let us now introduce the two - level boson model whose hamiltonian is    @xmath6    where the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined as @xmath9 in terms of two species of scalar bosons @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 being two independent control parameters . the total number of bosons @xmath14 is a conserved quantity .",
    "the connection between the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and a generalized lipkin model or a two - spin model can be obtained by making the inverse of the schwinger transformation @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we have deliberatively written the two - level boson hamiltonian in the form ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) to resemble qch , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 play the role of the @xmath10 and @xmath18 bosons of the ibm respectively .",
    "clearly , the difference resides on the quadrupolar character of the @xmath18 boson leading to the @xmath19 algebra of the ibm , while our model is described by a @xmath20 algebra . despite of this important difference , the @xmath21 model captures the main characteristics of the phase diagram of ibm as we will now show .",
    "the phase diagram of model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can be easily obtained in the coherent state approach .",
    "therefore , we introduce a variational state of the form    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes the boson vacuum . the corresponding energy surface as a function of the variational parameter @xmath24 , in the large @xmath25 limit ,",
    "is given by : @xmath26 \\big\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] minimization of the energy ( [ eq : es ] ) with respect to @xmath24 , for given values of the control parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , gives the equilibrium value @xmath27 defining the phase of the system .",
    "@xmath28 corresponds to the symmetric phase , and @xmath29 to the broken symmetry phase . here",
    ", we restrict the study to the range @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 which implies @xmath32 .",
    "however , the treatment can be easily extended to the whole parameter space .",
    "the schematic phase diagram of the @xmath21 model is presented in fig . [",
    "phased ] in the region of interest around the phase transition .",
    "in addition to the critical line displayed by the solid curve , we show the spinodal and antispinodal lines where the second minimum in the energy surface ( [ eq : es ] ) starts to appear indicating a region in which both phases coexist .    ) in the plane of the control parameters @xmath33 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the transition is second - order whereas it is first - order otherwise.,width=245 ]    for @xmath34 , there is an isolated point of second order phase transition as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "spinodal , antispinodal and critical point coincide at the critical value @xmath35 . for @xmath36 the phase transition changes its character to first order as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath37 .",
    "schematically , for @xmath38 , the system is in the symmetric phase since the energy surface has a unique minimum at @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath12 decreases , one reaches the spinodal point ( @xmath40 for @xmath37 ) where a second local ( nonsymmetric ) minimum ( @xmath41 ) arises .",
    "this nonsymmetric minimum competes with the symmetric one till both attain the same depth at the critical point @xmath42 . beyond this value ,",
    "the symmetric minimum at @xmath39 becomes a local minimum till @xmath43 where it becomes unstable ( anti - spinodal point ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , ( left panels ) , a sketch of this evolution for the special cases @xmath44 .",
    "the right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] show two cases in the coexistence region .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this scheme is exactly the same as the one obtained in the ibm of nuclear structure .",
    "in fact the value @xmath37 is equivalent to @xmath45 describing the @xmath0 to @xmath46 side of the casten triangle @xcite as we are showing now .",
    "the energy ( [ eq : es ] ) coincides with that of the q - consistent ibm-1 hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit ( large @xmath25 ) .",
    "this correspondance is readily established if we write the q - consistent ibm-1 hamiltonian @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the @xmath49boson number operator and @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 with @xmath52 the structure parameter of the quadrupole operator of the ibm . for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonianibm ] )",
    "the energy surface in the large @xmath25 limit reads ( see for instance eq .",
    "( 6 ) in ref .",

    "this correspondence can also be obtained from ( [ eq : qdefibm ] ) if one is restricted to the spherical @xmath55 component of the @xmath56-bosons . in that case @xmath57 with the clebsch - gordan coefficient @xmath58 .",
    "it should be clear that this equivalence is only valid in the thermodynamical limit and restricted to the scalar excitations .",
    "differences between both models are due to the fluctuations induced by the @xmath1vibration over the mean field .",
    "the present scalar model does not include @xmath59 excitations and consequently can not be used to study @xmath1excitations .",
    "but , apart from that , it mimics the usual representation of the ibm in a casten triangle as shown in fig .",

    "thus , changing the control parameters ( @xmath65 ) ( or @xmath66 in ibm ) one can reach any point in the triangle and , consequently analyze any trajectory in it looking for critical phenomena . in this respect ,",

    "variation of the control parameters , either in ibm or in the present model , allows to explore the whole model space represented by the triangle.,width=264 ]    we would like to emphasize here that the @xmath21 boson model has a natural order parameter , the expectation value of the @xmath11-boson number operator @xmath7 .",
    "this is not the case in the spin representation of the model @xcite . on this regard",
    ", the schwinger mapping could be used to translate the number operator @xmath7 into spin operators suggesting an order parameter for the latter model . in the coherent state representation ( @xmath70 ) the expectation value of the @xmath11-boson number operator",
    "is simply given by @xmath71 .",

    "for @xmath34 , the @xmath21 model corresponds , up to some redefinitions of the parameters , to the lmg model which has been recently shown to display nontrivial finite - size scaling properties at the transition point @xcite . as explained above",
    ", the transition for @xmath79 is of first order and it is thus natural to expect some qualitative changes for the finite - size corrections . to analyze them , we follow the same route as those detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath80 .    for sake of clarity , we briefly sketch now this approach in the symmetric phase and refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . for @xmath81 , we map the one - body operators using the holstein - primakoff boson expansion @xcite onto a single @xmath82-boson    @xmath83    with @xmath84 . at order @xmath85 , in the symmetric phase , the hamiltonian schematically reads : @xmath86 we make use of the canonical transformation method which allows to diagonalize exactly the hamiltonian order by order . at order @xmath87 ,",
    "@xmath88 is simply a quadratic form and is thus simply diagonalized via a bogoliubov transform . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , diagonalizing @xmath88 beyond this order only requires to solve a linear set of algebraic equations . more concretely ,",
    "let us introduce the @xmath89-boson through : @xmath90 where the @xmath91 are coefficients to be determined such that @xmath88 expanded at order @xmath92 is a polynomial function in @xmath93 .",

    "the content in @xmath95 and @xmath96 is given by a simple power counting analysis .",
    "for @xmath97 , this transformation is nothing but the bogoliubov transformation @xmath98 and we thus have two coefficients to determine which are solutions of quadratic equations . at order @xmath99",
    ", one must include linear and cubic terms and we have six coefficients @xmath100 to find which are now solutions of a linear set of equations .",
    "one then gets , at order @xmath101 , the following diagonal form of the hamiltonian :    @xmath102 + \\nonumber \\\\ & &   { x^2(x-1 ) \\over 2 n } \\left",

    "the ground state energy as well as the gap are regular functions provided @xmath104 which is the value of the critical point for @xmath34 . for nonvanishing @xmath13 ,",
    "it means that for @xmath105 , there is no divergence in these quantities .",
    "one thus naively expect some @xmath101 corrections from this side of the transition .     near the critical point for @xmath37 . the full bold line and the full dot at @xmath106 correspond to the analytical results .",

    "it then requires the exact knowledge of @xmath27 which is solution of the cubic equation @xmath107 .",
    "if , for arbitrary @xmath108 , it is a complicated expression of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the nonvanishing solution for @xmath109 simply reads @xmath110 and thus allows for simplifications .",
    "the main result of this study is that the hamiltonian expanded at order @xmath101 is exactly the same at the critical point @xmath109 for @xmath28 and @xmath110 . of course",
    ", at order @xmath25 , one finds @xmath111 which simply confirms the existence of a first order quantum phase transition .",
    "the most interesting point is that the finite - size corrections are also the same for both values of @xmath27 .",
    "physically , it means that for @xmath112 the gap is @xmath113 but for @xmath109 , the gap must vanish in the large @xmath25 limit . in fig .",
    "[ figaver1 ] we show the behaviour of the gap in the region around the critical point , @xmath106 , for @xmath37 . as can be seen gaps in the symmetric and the broken phases are indeed equal at @xmath114 .",

    "the exponent @xmath116 is a function of @xmath13 that vanishes in the limit @xmath34 where we expect @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "this exponential decay clearly indicates that the @xmath101 expansions from the symmetric phase ( @xmath28 ) and from the broken one ( @xmath110 ) are the same at all orders since any difference would imply a power - law decrease .",
    "as will be discussed in a forthcoming publication for the standard ibm model , we emphasize that this matching of the @xmath101 expansions is not a rule but rather an exception @xcite . in fig .",

    "the excitation energies for these two states for @xmath77 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figaver2 ] as circles joined by a ( green ) line .",
    "for @xmath118 the system is in the broken phase . in the limit @xmath72",
    "there are two sets of states of different `` parity '' degenerated ( @xmath119 parity doublets ) as displayed by the lowest ( green ) circle - line in fig .",
    "[ figaver2 ] . in this phase",
    "the nonvanishing gap is related to the excitation energy of a different phonon which corresponds to the upper ( green ) circle - line .",
    "it is equivalent to the @xmath24 excitation in ibm ( there are no @xmath1 excitation in this scalar model ) . in the limit @xmath120 both gaps ( from the spherical and from the broken sides ) go to zero at the critical point , although they remain finite at finite @xmath25 as clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ figaver2 ] .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced a two - level model in terms of two scalar bosons @xmath10 and @xmath11 , whose phase diagram in the thermodynamical limit is the same as the ibm phase diagram when described by the qch .",
    "we have exactly diagonalized the hamiltonian in the symmetric phase up to order @xmath5 and obtained the finite - size corrections for the ground state energy , the gap and the order parameter .",
    "these corrections were tested against numerical results for large systems . though the phase diagram of this @xmath21 model and the qch coincide in the large @xmath25 limit , beyond the mean - field level the qch may have different properties due to the dynamics of fluctuations and correlations in the full ( @xmath24,@xmath1 ) space @xcite .",
    "in particular , while our @xmath21 model is fully integrable @xcite the ibm is chaotic for @xmath121 @xcite with the exception of the @xmath46 symmetry limit .",
