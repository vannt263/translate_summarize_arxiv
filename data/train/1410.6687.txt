    "this decade will witness the advent of direct gravitational wave ( gw ) detection : advanced ground - based detectors such as ligo and virgo are scheduled to come online as early as 2015 and should hopefully provide numerous detections of stellar mass systems . within the same time frame , pulsar timing array analysis is expected to advance to a point where the first detection of supermassive black hole binaries ( smbhbs ) in the nhz range will be possible . by 2034 ,",
    "the european space agency plans to launch a space - based lisa - like gw detector called elisa ; the theme of the gravitational universe@xmath0 was recently chosen for the esa cosmic vision l3 mission in order to nourish the development of a space - based gw mission .",
    "the vast majority of algorithms in gw astronomy are based on the concept of matched filtering .",
    "the detection of signals and the process of parameter estimation are conducted by assuming a particular underlying gravitational theory that is , a priori , considered to be true ; in our case this is the theory of general relativity ( gr ) . that a waveform based on this theory is able to detect the signals present in the data",
    ", however , does not mean that it is the theory providing the best fit to the data .",
    "alternative theories of gravity , deviating only slightly from gr , could also provide waveforms that also detect the signal just as well , albeit with different best - fit model parameters . thus ,",
    "if we use the wrong waveform for parameter estimation , the inferred parameters will have a fundamental bias  @xcite and will not fully reflect reality .",
    "this raises the question of which particular theory of gravity should be preferred in the light of the measured data . by observing smbhbs , which are among the strongest sources of gws ,",
    "alternative theories can be compared to gr via a bayesian inference , where the odds ratio provides a useful tool in measuring the betting odds for a certain alternative theory against gr .",
    "the space of available model hypotheses can then be populated with _ specific _ alternative theories ( that are usually based on a modified einstein - hilbert action , such as scalar - tensor theories , chern - simons theory , etc . ) or _ generic _ features that are not present in gr ( such as a non - zero graviton mass , lorentz violation , variable @xmath1 , etc . ) .",
    "one could then test all these ( classes of ) theories against gr .",
    "it is noteworthy that such approaches all have the common feature that they modify either the phase or the amplitude of the gw modelled by gr  @xcite .",
    "interested in the mere fact of whether there exists a theory that describes the data better than gr , instead of testing for specific theories or generic features , one could thus just impose a set of theories that modify certain post - newtonian ( pn ) amplitude or phase coefficients of gr , without considering a particular action or a particular physical feature .",
    "one would then of course have to make sure that deviations originate from fundamental physics and not from other effects , such as astrophysical pollution or pathologies in the chosen pn approximation scheme .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been done in the aforementioned field .",
    "arun , iyer , qusailah and sathyprakash  @xcite turned the question of testing gr into the exact measurement of the pn coefficients @xmath2 of the stationary phase approximation ( spa ) instead of measuring individual binary parameters , while yunes and pretorius  @xcite added an amplitude correction to introduce their parameterized post - einsteinian ( ppe ) scheme as    @xmath3    where tilde denotes a fourier transform , @xmath4 is the reduced frequency , @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the speed of light and @xmath7 is the chirp mass with total mass @xmath8 and symmetric mass ratio @xmath9 . in this scheme ,",
    "the ppe parameters @xmath10 can in general be real numbers .",
    "there are several studies regarding the performance of the ppe scheme in model selection @xcite .",
    "sampson et al . have shown in @xcite that leading order corrections as applied to gr in eq .",
    "are already enough to distinguish gr from any competing theory .",
    "there is also the tiger pipeline devised for ground - based detector data analysis @xcite .",
    "the previously mentioned approaches are constructed directly in the frequency domain and use the spa to motivate the corrections they introduce to gr .",
    "the spa was initially introduced into the field of gw astronomy as it saved on computational cost by making a fast fourier transform ( fft ) unnecessary , without much loss in accuracy .",
    "we chose not to rely on the spa for the following reasons : i ) ffts have nowadays become considerably faster and use only 3 - 8% of the time needed for waveform generation , ii ) several studies have shown issues with the spa , especially in the high - mass regime ; there modifications such as the introduction of unphysical mass ratios or pseudo-4pn terms are of some help @xcite , iii ) even if the time - domain pn approximation breaks down by producing non - monotonic phase and frequency evolutions below a certain orbital separation , the spa waveforms still look fine at this point and do not indicate their apparent failure , and iv ) as direct time - domain waveforms have been more commonly used to assess the parameter estimation capabilities of lisa - like detectors .    in the following sections we will quickly review the waveform models in the time domain and the spa , create a modified time domain waveform and compare it to a phase - only ppe scheme",
    "in the time domain , the gravitational waveform is governed by the evolution of orbital frequency and phase @xcite : @xmath11 , \\\\",

    "in contrast to @xcite , we chose to take only modifications to the phase into account and neglect any corrections to the amplitude ( i.e. @xmath27 ) .",
    "eq . amounts to a modification of the spa phase in terms of @xmath28 where ` ngr ' stands for ` non - gr ' . in a similar way",
    ", however slightly more adapted to eq .  , we chose to modify the time domain phase @xmath29 with @xmath30 . if leading order corrections are enough to detect a deviation from gr in the frequency domain in eq .  , then in principle they should also be sufficient in eq .  .",
    "for the sake of a comparison between corrected time domain and spa waveforms , however , we include higher orders to eq .",

    "is as close as possible to an spa waveform with a phase described by eq .  .",
    "to this end , let us construct a relation which allows us to compare the coefficients of eqs .   and by taking the derivative of the definition of the spa phase .",

    "assuming that @xmath32 and @xmath57 are small enough such that all terms can be expanded at linear order , and by setting @xmath58 to zero results in a linear system that can be solved for @xmath59 .",
    "we chose to fix the correction orders between 0pn and 2pn , in particular , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; this corresponds to 0pn , 0.5pn , 1pn , 1.5pn and 2pn corrections to the phase / frequency , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we chose not to consider ` negative ' pn terms due to dipole radiation because we plan to apply the waveforms to smbh inspirals where , at least in scalar - tensor theories , there appears to be no dipole radiation present @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we fix one particular value of @xmath62 at a time and allow the full sum of corrections proportional to @xmath32 in the time domain phase .",
    "we have solved the linear system and have computed @xmath59 for each value of @xmath62 .",

    "as previously mentioned , we chose to consider only the leading order corrections and are thus able to write the corrected time domain phase as ( using @xmath76 ) @xmath77 with a modified orbital frequency given by @xmath78 equations and can then be used in the gw polarisations described by eqs .   to generate a modified waveform that approximately uses the same @xmath57 parameter as a leading order phase - only ppe scheme .",
    "we assume that our coupling constant @xmath57 is manifestly positive as we would like to distinguish between possible positive and negative corrections to the gr waveform .",
    "we have introduced alternative theory corrections to the time domain phase and orbital frequency for a gw generated by a compact binary inspiral in gr . in order to compare these waveforms to leading order phase - corrected frequency domain waveforms ,",
    "we have established a relation between the magnitude parameters @xmath79 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have implemented the corrected time domain waveforms into a markov chain monte carlo code that assesses the ability of the elisa detector to discriminate between gr and alternatives theories in the context of smbhb inspirals .",
