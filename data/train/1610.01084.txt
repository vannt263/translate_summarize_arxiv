    "manipulating the molecular rotational degrees of freedom in gas phase by means of laser fields remains a very attractive topic in quantum control @xcite with a wide range of applications in photochemistry extending from chemical reactivity @xcite to nanoscale design @xcite , stereochemistry @xcite , surface processing @xcite , catalysis @xcite , and attosecond molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "such phenomena play also a role in quantum computing @xcite and high - order harmonic generation @xcite . in this",
    "setting , molecular alignment and orientation can be identified as crucial prerequisites before exploring more complex control scenarios @xcite .",
    "the alignment process @xcite is by now a well - established concept from both the experimental and theoretical points of view with recent extensions ranging from the deflection of aligned molecules @xcite , the introduction of planar alignment @xcite , the control of molecular unidirectional motion @xcite , the study of molecular superrotors @xcite or the analysis of dissipation effects due to molecular collisions @xcite .",
    "the description and the control of molecular orientation are not currently at the same degree of improvement , in particular from the experimental point of view .",
    "molecular orientation was achieved in the adiabatic regime @xcite .",

    "can be obtained using such control strategies and a molecular quantum - state selection @xcite .",
    "control schemes in the sudden regime , where the duration of the control field is short with respect to the rotational period , have been also developed @xcite . among other techniques , we can mention the interaction of the molecule with a terahertz ( thz ) laser pulse and the @xmath0- scheme .",
    "note that a larger degree of orientation can be achieved with the two - color mechanisms through ionization depletion @xcite . in this second regime",
    ", molecular orientation has been recently addressed experimentally for linear molecules using only a thz field @xcite or its combination with a laser field @xcite , and in @xcite for an excitation process with two - color laser fields .    in this work ,",
    "we complement the previous experimental and theoretical works on the orientation dynamics produced by thz fields by exploring the orientation at high temperature ( typically room temperature ) of a symmetric top molecule , ch@xmath1i .",
    "this molecule is a good candidate to achieve a high degree of orientation at room temperature due to its large permanent dipole moment and its relatively small rotational constant @xcite .",
    "the thz pulses are obtained from the excitation of a plasma by a two - color femtosecond laser field @xcite , while the detection process is based on the free - induction decay ( fid ) emitted by the molecular sample after the thz excitation @xcite .",
    "we extend the previous studies on the subject by considering the case of a symmetric top molecule at room temperature .",
    "we show that a noticeable degree of orientation can be reached .",
    "a theoretical description of the propagation of a thz field in the sample shows that the fid is not proportional to the degree of orientation but to its time derivative .",
    "a complete analytical derivation of this result is given in this paper .",
    "note that this dependency has been already mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the relation between the fid and the degree of orientation allows us to quantitatively compare the experimental observations with the numerical simulations .",
    "a very good match is found for the first two orientation revivals .",
    "this agreement has been improved by accounting for the centrifugal distorsion and the relaxation effects in the computations @xcite .",
    "we also use this theoretical description to explore the influence of the laser parameters on the orientation dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental setup is described in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , with a special emphasis on the generation of thz pulses and on the detection process .",

    "the experimental set - up for producing and measuring molecular orientation is shown in fig.[set_up ] .",
    "it is based on a thz pulsed source and an electro - optical sampling device for the detection .",
    "the thz pulses are produced through plasma generation in gases with two - color femtosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "a fraction of the output of a chirped pulse amplifier ( cpa , 800 nm wavelength , 100 fs pulse duration , 7.5 mj energy , 100 hz repetition rate ) is focused in dry nitrogen . a type",
    "i phase matching @xmath2-barium borate ( bbo ) crystal is inserted on the beam path at a given distance from the focusing point to produce the second harmonic at 400 nm .",
    "the generation of thz pulses is optimized by adjusting the phase matching angle of the frequency doubling crystal and its longitudinal position using a micrometric stage .",
    "the thz source provides pulses of typically few hundred femtoseconds pulse duration with only one cycle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] below for details ) and covers a spectral range from 0 to 4 thz , with a maximum at about 1.5 thz .",
    "after collimation by an off - axis parabolic mirror , the two incoming beams at 800 and 400 nm are filtered out by means of a 2-mm thick plate from polytetrafluoroethylene and a thin black polyethylene sheet . the thz pulse is then focused in a cell ( 40 mm optical pathway ) containing the sample at room temperature .",
    "the ch@xmath3i sample ( _ sigma aldrich _ ,",

    "the windows are in polymethylpentene polymer ( tpx , 38.1 mm diameter , 2.0 mm thickness ) .",
    "the transmitted thz radiation is collected from the sample by another off - axis parabolic mirror and sent to the detection device .",
    "this latter is based on an electro - optical sampling of the thz pulse shape in the time domain @xcite . the weak probe beam ( typically @xmath5 nj ) derived from the output of the cpa",
    "is focused and spatially overlapped with the thz radiation in a znte ( 110 ) crystal .",
    "the polarization of the probe beam is modified through the pockels effect induced by the thz beam ( electro - optic detection process ) .",
    "this allows us to sample the thz electric field by changing the time delay between the two pulses with a motorized delay line stage .",
    "the change of the polarization state of the probe beam is measured from the combination of a quarter wave plate ( qwp ) , a wollaston prism ( wp ) , and two head - to - tail connected photodiodes so that the difference of their signals is directly obtained ( see fig .",
    "[ set_up ] ) .",
    "the difference signal is then amplified and sent to a lock - in amplifier synchronized with the laser repetition rate .",
