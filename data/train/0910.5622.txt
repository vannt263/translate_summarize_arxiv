    "entanglement is not only of fundamental interest to quantum mechanics but also of great importance to quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "however , due to the inevitable interaction of qubits with their environments , entanglement always experiences degradation . entanglement sudden death ( esd ) , a phenomenon in which the entanglement between two qubits may completely disappear in a finite time , has been predicted theoretically @xcite and subsequently been verified experimentally @xcite , indicating specific behavior of entanglement that differs from that of coherence . from the point of view of applications , esd is apparently disadvantageous to quantum information processing .",
    "recently , bellomo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that the entanglement can revive after some time interval of esd and thus extends significantly the entangled time of the qubits .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon , which has been experimentally observed @xcite , is physically due to the dynamical back action ( that is , the non - markovian effect ) of the memory environments @xcite .",
    "however , in many cases the finite extension of the entangled time is not enough and thus it is desired to preserve a significant fraction of the entanglement in the longtime limit .",
    "indeed , it was shown @xcite that some noticeable fraction of entanglement can be obtained by engineering structured environment such as photonic band - gap materials @xcite . according to these works , it is still unclear whether the residual entanglement is fundamentally due to the specific structured materials or due to certain physical mechanisms .",
    "is there any essential relationship between esd and/or its revival phenomena and the residual entanglement ?    in this work we focus on these questions and elucidate the physical nature of the residual entanglement . before proceeding , it is helpful to recall the physics of quantum electrodynamics of a single two - level atom placed in a dielectric with a photonic band gap @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the excited atom and electromagnetic vacuum in the dielectric leads to a novel photon - atom bound state @xcite , in which the fractional atomic population on the excited state occurs , also known as population trapping @xcite .",
    "this result has been verified experimentally for quantum dots embedded in a photonic band - gap environment @xcite .",
    "the population trapping has been directly connected to the entanglement trapping due to the structured environment @xcite . here",
    "we reveal that there are two essential conditions needed to preserve the entanglement .",
    "one is the existence of the bound state between the system and its environment , which provides the ability to preserve the entanglement , and the other is the non - markovian effect , which provides a way to preserve the entanglement .",
    "our result can reproduce esd @xcite when the non - markovian effect is neglected .",
    "the phenomenon of esd and its revival discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite results from the non - markovian effect when the bound state is not available .",
    "the interplay between the availability of the bound state and the non - markovian effect can lead to a significant fraction of the entanglement preserved in the steady state .",
    "we verify these results by considering two reservoirs modeled by the super - ohmic and lorentzian spectra , respectively .",
    "the result provides a general method on how to protect the entanglement by engineering the environment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , the model of two independent qubits in two reservoirs is introduced . by exploring the eigen - spectrum of the model",
    ", we derive the condition for the formation of bound states between the qubits and their respective reservoirs and discuss its profound consequence on the dynamics of the open two - qubit system . in sec .",
    "[ etd ] , the entanglement preservation caused by the formation of a bound state and the non - markovian effect is studied numerically in different cases of the environmental spectral density .",
    "finally , we end with a short conclusion and a discussion about the experimental feasibility of our result in sec .",
    "we consider a system consisting of two independent subsystems , each of which contains a qubit coupled to a zero - temperature reservoir . due to the dynamical independence between the two subsystems",
    ", we can first investigate the single subsystem , then extend our studies to the double - system case .",
    "the hamiltonian of each subsystem is @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the inversion operators and transition frequency of the qubit , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath5th mode with frequency @xmath6 of the reservoir , and @xmath7 denotes the coupling strength between the atom and the radiation field .    to check the spectrum of the hamiltonian we first solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath8 if only one excitation is present in the system at zero temperature initially , then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atomic excited ( or ground ) state , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the vacuum state and the state with only one photon in the @xmath5th mode of the reservoir , respectively . substituting eq .",
    "( [ hm ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) , one has @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spectral density of the reservoir .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) highly depends on the explicit form of @xmath15 . if the reservoir contains only one mode @xmath16 , then @xmath17 .",
    "this is the ideal jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite , in which two bound states in one excitation sector are formed and as a result the dynamics of the system displays a lossless oscillation . when the reservoir contains infinite modes , one can model @xmath15 by some typical spectrum functions such as the super - ohmic or lorentzian forms .",
    "we first consider the super - ohmic spectrum @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a dimensionless coupling constant and @xmath20 characterizes the frequency regime in which the power law is valid @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the case in which the reservoir consists of a vacuum radiation field , where @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the existence of a bound state requires that eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) has at least a real solution for @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to check that the solution always exists if the condition @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath24 ) is satisfied .",
    "otherwise , no bound state exists .",
    "this condition can be fulfilled easily by engineering the environment . for the lorentzian spectrum",
    "it is found that a criterion for the existence of a bound state can not be obtained analytically . in this case",
    "one can use the diagrammatic technique shown later .",
    "the existence of a bound state has a profound implication on the dynamics of the single - qubit system such as the inhibition of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it also has an important impact on the entanglement dynamics of a two - qubit system , which is governed by the master equation @xcite @xmath25+\\gamma ( t)[2\\sigma _ { -}^{n}\\rho ( t)\\sigma _ { + } ^{n }   \\notag \\\\ & & -\\sigma _ { + } ^{n}\\sigma _ { -}^{n}\\rho ( t)-\\rho ( t)\\sigma _ { + } ^{n}\\sigma _ { -}^{n}]\\ } ,   \\label{mstt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 $ ] , and @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "it is shown that @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "the time - dependent parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 play the role of lamb - shifted frequency and decay rate of the qubits , respectively .",
    "the integro - differential equation ( [ c0 ] ) contains the memory effect of the reservoir registered in the time - nonlocal kernel function @xmath33 and thus the dynamics of the qubit displays a non - markovian effect .",
    "if @xmath33 is replaced by the time - local function , then eq .",
    "( [ mstt ] ) recovers the conventional born - markovian master equation , where the parameters become constants @xcite , that is , @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the cauchy principal value .",
    "the dynamical consequence of the bound state is decoherence suppression @xcite .",
    "if a bound state is absent , then eq . ( [ eigen ] ) has only complex solutions .",
    "physically this means that the corresponding eigenstate experiences decay from the imaginary part of the eigenvalue during the time evolution , which causes the excited - state population to approach zero asymptotically and the decoherence of the reduced qubit system . while if a bound state is formed , then the population of the atomic excited state in the bound state is constant in time because a bound state is actually a stationary state with a vanishing decay rate during the time evolution .",
    "so there will be some residual excited - state population in the long - time limit . due to this decoherence suppression",
    ", we expect that the formation of a bound state plays a constructive role in entanglement preservation under the non - markovian dynamics , as shown in the following section .",
    "to study the entanglement dynamics of the bipartite system , we use the concurrence to quantify entanglement @xcite .",
    "the concurrence is defined as @xmath36 , where the decreasing - order - arranged quantities @xmath37 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath38 .",
    "here @xmath39 means the complex conjugation of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the pauli matrix .",
    "it can be proved that the concurrence varies from 0 for a separable state to 1 for a maximally entangled state .",
    "consider an initially entangled state @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath44 can be calculated as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 ) determines solely the entanglement dynamics .",
    "now we are ready to study the entanglement dynamics of the two - qubit system .",
    "consider first the super - ohmic case .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the entanglement dynamics in different parameter regimes [ i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for the first two parameter sets the bound state",
    "is absent , while for the last one it is available , as shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) . whether the bound state exists or not plays a key role in the entanglement preservation in the longtime limit . when the bound state is absent , the residual entanglement approaches zero in a long enough time , as shown by the non - markovian lines in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) .",
    "the difference between these two cases is that fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows the weak - coupling regime , where the non - markovian effect is weak , while fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) shows the strong - coupling regime , where the strong non - markovian effect leads to an obvious oscillation .",
    "when the bound state is available , the situation is quite different , as shown in fig . [ fig1](d ) .",
    "the entanglement first experiences some oscillations due to the energy and/or information exchanging back and forth between the qubit and its memory environment @xcite , then approaches a definite value in the longtime limit , where the decay rate approaches zero after some oscillations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . _",
    "the entanglement preservation is a result of the interplay between the existence of the bound state ( providing the ability to preserve the entanglement ) and the non - markovian effect ( providing a way to preserve the entanglement)_. the claim can be further verified by the fact that the entanglement preservation is absent in the markovian dynamics , as shown by the markovian lines in figs .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) , where the entanglement displays sudden death irrespective of the availability of the bound state .",
    "this is because the markovian environment has no memory and the energy and information flowing from the qubit to its environment is irreversible and the decay rate remains fixed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in this case one",
    "has @xmath49\\ } , \\label{cmar}\\ ] ] which shows a finite disentanglement time when @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "in short , different to the need for a structured environment as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , our discussion clearly reveals two essential conditions to preserve the entanglement : the availability of the bound state and the non - markovian effect .",
    "this discussion focused on an almost maximally entangled initial state by taking @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the results for different initial states with different initial entanglement . with decreasing initial entanglement",
    ", the residual entanglement also decreases in the longtime limit and , finally , esd happens for @xmath52 .",
    "the result can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ t12 ] ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the residual entanglement is determined by @xmath53 , which is directly related to the property of the bound state . on the other hand ,",
    "the residual entanglement is also determined by the competition between the first and the second terms in eq .",
    "( [ t12 ] ) , which is dependent of the initial state .    in order to make a comparative study and confirm our observations we consider the lorentzian spectrum if the reservoir is composed of a lossy cavity , @xmath54where @xmath55 is the coupling constant and @xmath56 is the spectrum width .",
    "this model has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the lower limit of the frequency integral in @xmath57 was extended from zero to negative infinity .",
    "this extension is mathematically convenient but the availability of the bound state is missed .",
    "here we follow the original definition of the frequency integral ranges .",
    "our model with the lorentzian spectral density corresponds exactly to the extended damping j - c model @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the strong coupling of the j - c model has been achieved in circuit qed @xcite and quantum dot @xcite systems .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the entanglement dynamics of the qubits under the lorentizan reservoir for different spectral widths in the strong - coupling regime . when @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) lacks the bound state . according to our discussion",
    ", there is no residual entanglement in the longtime limit .",
    "this is indeed true , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "however , it is noted that before becoming zero the entanglement exhibits  sudden death \" and revives for several times .",
    "this is an analog of the central result found in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , the phenomenon of esd and revival .",
    "apparently , this is due to the non - markovian effect with the revival being a result of back action of the memory reservoir .",
    "the situation changes with increasing the spectral width , and the bound states become available .",
    "a significant fraction of the entanglement initially present is preserved in the longtime limit , where the decay rates shown in the insert of fig . [",
    "fig4](b ) approach zero in these cases .",
    "likewise , the physical nature of the entanglement preservation is still the interplay between the bound state and the non - markovian effect .",
    "the stronger the coupling is , the more striking the entanglement oscillates as a function of time and , consequently , the more noticeable the non - markovian effect is , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the system is in the weak - coupling regime , where the bound state is also not available . as a result",
    ", esd is reproduced in this case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present a phase diagram of the entanglement in the steady state for the lorentzian spectral density . in the large-@xmath60 and small-@xmath61 regime ,",
    "the system approaches the j - c model .",
    "in this situation the strong back action effect of the reservoirs makes it difficult for the qubit system to form a steady state .",
    "the entanglement oscillates with time but has no dissipation . in the small-@xmath60 and large-@xmath61 regime ,",
    "the non - markovian effect is extremely weak and our results reduce to the markovian case . in the limit of a flat spectral density ,",
    "the born - markovian approximation is applicable and the system has no bound state .",
    "this is the case of esd @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the entanglement protection of two qubits in two uncorrelated reservoirs .",
    "two essential conditions for preserving the entanglement are explored : the existence of the bound state of the system and its reservoir and the non - markovian effect .",
    "the bound state provides the ability of the entanglement preservation and the non - markovian effect provides the way to protect the entanglement .",
    "previous results on the entanglement dynamics in the literature can be considered as specific cases where these two conditions have not been fulfilled at the same time . the result here provides a unified picture for the entanglement dynamics and gives a clear way on how to protect the entanglement .",
    "this is quite significant in quantum information processing .",
    "the presence of such entanglement preservation actually gives us an active way to suppress decoherence .",
    "this could be achieved by modifying the properties of the reservoir to form a bound state and to approach the non - markovian regime via the potential usage of reservoir engineering @xcite .",
    "many experimental platforms ( e.g. , mesoscopic ion traps @xcite , cold atom becs @xcite , and the photonic crystal materials @xcite have exhibited the controllability of decoherence behavior of relevant quantum systems through optimally designing the size ( i.e. , modifying the spectrum ) of the reservoir and/or the coupling strength between the system and the reservoir .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that a proposal aimed at simulating the spin - boson model , which is relevant to the one considered in this paper , has been reported in a trapped ion system @xcite . on the other hand many practical systems",
    "can now be engineered to show the novel non - markovian effect @xcite .",
    "all these achievements demonstrate that the recent advances have paved the way to experimentally simulate the paradigmatic models of open quantum system , which is one part of the newly emerging field of quantum simulators @xcite .",
    "our work sheds new light on the way to indirectly control and manipulate the dynamics of a quantum system in these experimental platforms .",
