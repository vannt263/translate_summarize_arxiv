    "most likely , a large fraction of the participants in this meeting are familiar with the challenges faced by lattice qcd at non - zero baryon density@xcite : the region of quark chemical potential @xmath2 exceeding @xmath3 remains prohibitively difficult , due to a severe sign problem@xcite .    for smaller chemical potential a variety of methods",
    "have been proposed to circumvent these difficulties , which have been quite successful in many respects . however , even in the easy region @xmath4 there are challenges to face : for instance , it has been noted that most current estimates of the qcd endpoint lie dangerously close to the forbidden region @xmath5 ; the qualitative agreement among different results on the slope of the critical line still needs to be corroborated by some convincing continuum estimates obtained with different methods . and",
    ", there is a growing interest in the values of higher order susceptibilities , particularly at larger values of the chemical potential , while the current results are limited to the lowest order ones @xcite .",
    "so there is room for improvement , which can perhaps be achieved by mixing and matching different approaches .",
    "one way to handle the physics of small chemical potential relies on taylor expansion@xcite .",
    "this approach is well understood mathematically , however it only works inside its convergency circle , whose radius is unknown .",
    "moreover even inside the circle it is hard to judge when convergence has been achieved . alternatively , analytic continuation from imaginary chemical potential  where conventional simulations are possible  to real chemical potential can in principle be extended to the entire analytic domain , but the danger here is a possible lack of control over the continuation itself : for instance , terms which are subleading for imaginary chemical potential might well become leading for real chemical potential .",
    "the strengths of the two methods are somewhat complementary , and their weaknesses different : this suggests to develop a hybrid method which combines the two , and this note reports on our ongoing effort in this direction@xcite .",

    "our study for staggered 2 + 1 flavors on lattices of size @xmath1 clearly is exploratory .",
    "however , the quark mass values are close to the ones realized in nature .",
    "the goldstone pion mass is tuned to about @xmath6 mev and the kaon acquires its physical mass .",
    "this corresponds to a ( degenerate ) light to strange quark mass ratio of @xmath7 .",
    "the action utilized is the p4fat3 action for which taylor coefficients computed at @xmath8 are available in our range of temperatures and at our quark masses@xcite .",

    "consider now the magnetic equation of state@xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are identified with the light chiral condensate and the light bare mass : @xmath17 , @xmath18 respectively , @xmath19 is a scaling function which only depends on the universality class of the transition , and @xmath20 defines the critical line .",
    "our light mass does not change : if scaling ( i.e. eq .",
    "1 ) holds true the chiral condensate results plotted versus @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the critical chemical potential for each temperature @xmath23 , should fall on a single curve . in fig.1",
