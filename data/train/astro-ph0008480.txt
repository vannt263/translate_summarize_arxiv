    "the theory of synchrotron emission in relativistic jets was developed around 1980 mainly by blandford & knigl ( @xcite ) , marscher ( @xcite ) and knigl ( @xcite ) . in 1985",
    ", both marscher & gear ( @xcite , hereafter mg85 ) and hughes et al . ( @xcite ) proposed a model for the emission of a shock wave propagating down a simple relativistic jet .",
    "both groups assumed that the jet is confined to a cone of constant opening angle and that the jet flow is adiabatic .",

    "the model of mg85 has however the advantage to include the effects of synchrotron and inverse - compton energy losses of the electrons , which can not be neglected at higher frequencies .",
    "it provides a simple explanation for the distinct components in the jet observed using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "multi - wavelength total flux measurements were found to be difficult to use to constrain the shock model of mg85 , because the emission of all distinct features in the jet often overlap to form a nearly flat total spectrum , as illustrated by marscher ( @xcite ) for the quasar nrao  140 .",
    "it is only since 1995 that the very well sampled total flux millimetre and radio light - curves of a few sources allowed to study the spectral evolution of individual synchrotron outbursts . by subtracting a quiescent spectrum assumed to be constant , litchfield et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and stevens et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) could follow the early evolution of single synchrotron outbursts in 3c  279 , pks  0420@xmath0014 , 3c  345 and , respectively .",
    "these studies gave additional support to the mg85 model , but failed to constrain it strongly , mainly because they could only follow the evolution of an outburst until the onset of the next one .",
    "to overcome this problem , trler et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) proposed a new approach to derive the observed properties of synchrotron outbursts , which consists in a complete decomposition of long - term multi - wavelength light - curves into a series of self - similar flaring events .",
    "two different approaches are presented in paper  i to describe the evolution of these events with both time and frequency .",
    "the so called `` light - curve approach '' is model - independent and describes empirically the shape of the light - curves of individual outbursts at different frequencies .",
    "a second approach based on three - stage shock models , like those of mg85 or valtaoja et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , describes directly the evolution of the flaring synchrotron spectrum . finally ,",
    "the `` hybrid approach '' of trler ( @xcite ) models strictly the shape of the synchrotron spectrum , but leaves the evolution of the spectral turnover as free as possible .",
    "the results of this third approach , based on self - similar outbursts as in paper  i , were found to be in very good agreement with the spectral evolution expected by the shock model of mg85 .",
    "after this last test , the next step , which is presented here , is to adapt the shock model of mg85 in order to describe physically both the average evolution of the outbursts and their individual specificity .",
    "this generalized shock model , described in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] , takes into account the effects of an accelerating or decelerating synchrotron source in a curved , non - conical and non - adiabatic jet .",
    "this model is confronted to the observations by fitting seventeen distinct outbursts simultaneously to thirteen submillimetre - to - radio light - curves of 3c  273 .",
    "the proper parameterization to achieve this fit is described in sect .",
    "[ sec : parameterization ] and the results of this light - curve decomposition are given in sect .  [ sec : results ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of our results , both on the global properties of the inner jet and on the peculiarities of individual outbursts .",
    "the main results of this study are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "throughout this paper , we use the convention @xmath1 for the spectral index @xmath2 and we use `` @xmath3 '' , rather than `` @xmath4 '' , for the decimal logarithm `` @xmath5 '' , because of a lack of space in tables and long equations .",
    "the light - curves fitted here are part of the multi - wavelength database of 3c  273 presented by trler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the 12 light - curves from 5ghz to 0.35 mm are as described in paper  i , except that we now consider the observations up to 1999 , including the most recent measurements from the metshovi radio observatory in finland and from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) .",
    "we extend to lower frequencies the analysis of paper  i by adding a new light - curve at 2.7ghz .",
    "this light - curve is constituted of observations from the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) and from the 100 m telescope at effelsberg in germany ( reich et al .",
    "the fluxes obtained with the gbi at 2.7ghz and 2.25ghz include both 3c  273b ( the inner jet ) and 3c  273a ( the hot spot at the far end of the jet ) , but",
    "these two components combine partially out of phase ( ghigo f.d . , private communication ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the gbi measurements are only part of the total flux of 3c  273 and have to be multiplied by a scaling factor .",
    "to scale the gbi measurements at 2.25ghz we use the contemporaneous effelsberg single dish observations at 2.7ghz . the nearly flat spectral index of 3c  273 at this frequency ( trler et al .",
    "@xcite ) allows us to neglect the small difference in frequency .",
    "we obtain that the gbi fluxes at 2.25ghz have to be multiplied by 1.66 to fit the effelsberg observations .",
    "a similar calibration of the earlier gbi measurements at 2.7ghz is not possible due to the lack of contemporaneous single dish observations .",
    "we therefore let the scaling factor of these fluxes as a free parameter of our fit.we obtain a best - fit value of @xmath6 for this factor with the jet model presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] . ] to smooth out the dips in the gbi light - curves ( cf .",
    "trler et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we average all gbi observations into bins of 10 days .",
    "finally , we do not consider the gbi measurements before 1980 , to avoid a flux increase in the light - curve due to an outburst that started before 1979 .",
    "we end up with a total of 5234 observational points to constrain the shock model .",
    "in the original shock model of mg85 , the shock front was assumed to propagate with constant speed in a straight conical and adiabatic jet .",
    "partial generalizations of this model were already derived by marscher ( @xcite ) and marscher et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in the case of a bending jet , and by stevens et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in the two cases of a straight non - adiabatic jet and a curved adiabatic jet . here",

    "[ sec : individual ] we show how the physical conditions at the onset of the shock can influence the evolution of individual outbursts .          following mg85 , we consider the synchrotron radiation emitted just behind a shock front in a cylindric portion of a jet having a radius @xmath7 across the jet and a length @xmath8 along the jet axis , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the thickness @xmath8 of the emitting region behind the shock front is the crucial parameter that changes the outburst s evolution from one stage to the other .",

    "the two decompositions of fig .",
    "[ fig : history_spec ] , suggest that these two components are not of distinct nature , but that the flaring component progressively becomes part of the more slowly varying component as it evolves towards lower frequencies .",
    "it means that , apart from the contribution of the outer jet , the quiescent radio emission of 3c  273 can be entirely attributed to the superimposed decays of earlier outbursts .",
    "we have assumed in this work that the emission of the inner jet is negligible outside of a small region containing the shocked plasma just behind the shock front ( cf .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "it means that we have implicitly made the hypothesis that the emission of the unresolved vlbi core is due to the emission of the one or two most recent outbursts observed during the earlier phases of their evolution .",
    "this is a rather extreme assumption , since it is usually believed that the base of the jet is also contributing to the emission , because of the higher electron and magnetic field density at the narrow end of the jet .",
    "the present work shows that the main features of submillimetre - to - radio emission of 3c  273 can be understood as being only due to shock waves .",
    "there are , however , some indications that there is still some place left for an underlying contribution of the inner jet .",
    "the presence of an inner jet contribution is suggested by the relatively poor fit at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths and especially by the fact that it is not the shape of the variations which is the greatest problem , but much more the average flux level reached by the model , which is too low at some frequencies and too high at others ( cf .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the idea behind this is that the model seems to make a compromise between the opposite requests of , on the one hand , the millimetre observations asking to flatten the optically thin spectral index to have more flux during the slow decline of the outbursts and , on the other hand , the submillimetre observations asking to steepen this index , in order to decrease the flux level at the end of the outbursts .",
    "it is possible that this problem could be solved by adding an underlying nearly constant spectrum with a maximum around a frequency of 90ghz , in association with a steeper optically thin spectral index for the individual outbursts .",

    "such an underlying contribution from the inner jet to the millimetre and submillimetre emission of 3c  273 could possibly be related to the so called @xmath375 component identified in the blue - bump of 3c  273 by paltani et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . indeed , this slowly varying component , which dominates the optical spectrum , can be interpreted as synchrotron emission and might reveal the blazar - like characteristics of 3c  273 .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the obtained value of @xmath376 for the index @xmath91 suggests that the parallel @xmath365 and the perpendicular @xmath366 components of the magnetic field @xmath362 are roughly equal .",

    "another possibility , but which requires much more fine tuning , is that @xmath365 is dominant in the underlying jet and that the shock amplifies just enough the @xmath366 component ( see mg85 ) to end with @xmath377 .",

    "a non - conical jet can arise due to an accelerating jet flow ( marscher @xcite ) , but this interpretation would be in contradiction with the constant doppler factor @xmath24 assumed in this model .",
    "another possibility is that there is an external pressure which confines the jet , so that the jet does not expand freely in two dimensions .",

    "we obtain a comparable @xmath258 of the fit using an alternative model in which we assume that the jet is conical and thus that the index @xmath89 equals 1 . for this model",
    ", we obtained very similar values for most parameters given in table  [ tab : param ] , including the indices @xmath88 and @xmath91 , which therefore seem to be strongly constrained by the light - curve decomposition .",
    "what changes with this conical jet model are the values of the indices @xmath90 and @xmath92 .",
    "the value of @xmath90 decreases to @xmath379 , which is now almost the value of @xmath380 corresponding to an adiabatic jet flow and the best - fit value for @xmath92 is @xmath381 , which suggests either that the emitting region is slightly decelerating while it travels down the jet or that the jet is bending away from the line - of - sight . even if the shock front is not decelerating ,",
    "a slight deceleration of the centre of the emitting region is a natural consequence of the continuous increase of its thickness @xmath8 during the whole shock evolution .",
    "therefore , even for a straight jet , this positive value of @xmath92 might not be in contradiction with a value of @xmath90 typical for an adiabatic jet flow .",
    "on the other hand , it is well established that the path projected on the sky followed by the vlbi components in the parsec - scale jet of 3c  273 is curved ( e.g. abraham et al .",
    "it is therefore also possible that the slight decrease of the doppler factor @xmath24 suggested by the conical jet model is related to this overall bending of the jet .",
    "the fact that both the model with a constant doppler factor @xmath24 and the conical jet model give an equally good fit suggests that the light - curve decomposition can not uniquely determine the values of the three parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , by leaving all these parameters free to vary , we could not achieve a better fit than obtained with one of them fixed .",
    "it means that besides the two models discussed above , jet models with other combinations of the values of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath92 can not be excluded by our light - curve decomposition .",
    "concerning the specificity of individual outbursts , we noted in paper  i that short- and long - lived outbursts in 3c  273 are usually not peaking at the same frequency .",
    "long - lived outbursts were found to peak at lower frequencies and we proposed that this relationship might be related to the distance down the jet at which the shock forms .",
    "the proper interpretation of the peculiarities of individual outbursts is now complicated by the fact that the outbursts are not self - similar anymore , because of the different behaviour of the two stage transitions @xmath99 and @xmath104 when the physical quantities @xmath22 , @xmath9 and @xmath24 change ( cf .",
    "[ sec : individual ] ) .",
    "for instance , relatively high values of @xmath122 and low values of @xmath120 result in a shorter synchrotron stage .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced in the three successive outbursts between 1982 and 1984 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : shifts ] ) .",
    "the apparent absence of a flat peaking stage in 3c  345 ( stevens et al .",
    "@xcite ) could therefore be due to a relatively low magnetic field @xmath9 as compared to the factor @xmath22 of the electron energy distribution .",
    "we note in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] that there is apparently no correlation from one outburst to the other between the two quantities @xmath122 and @xmath120 at the onset of the shock .",
    "this result suggests that differences from one outburst to the other are not primarily due to changes of the compression ratio @xmath382 of the shock , because in this case we would expect correlated @xmath122 and @xmath120 variations due to their similar dependence on @xmath382 ( cf .",
    "changes of @xmath122 which are independent of @xmath120 could be possible if the acceleration process of the electrons crossing the shock front was not adiabatic .",
    "in this case , the energy gain @xmath383 of the electrons would not simply be related to the compression ratio as @xmath384 ( mg85 ) , but might have different behaviours from one outburst to the other . since the normalization @xmath122 of the electron energy distribution is proportional to @xmath385 ( mg85 ) , changes of the electron energy gain @xmath383 for different shocks in 3c  273 could lead to the observed changes of @xmath122 .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the significant anti - correlation found between @xmath122 and the doppler factor @xmath123 , because a non - adiabatic shock wave converts bulk kinetic energy into internal energy ( e.g. begelman et al .",
    "outbursts with a small value of @xmath24 and a great value of @xmath22 , would therefore be associated with more efficient shocks , for which a greater fraction of their bulk kinetic energy , as measured by @xmath24 , would be converted into internal energy by increasing the average energy gain @xmath383 of the electrons .",
    "this work presents a phenomenological model describing the evolution of synchrotron outbursts expected to be emitted by shock waves in a relativistic jet .",
    "this model , which is a generalization of the original shock model of mg85 , is then confronted to the very well sampled long - term submillimetre - to - radio light - curves of 3c  273 .",
    "many iterative fits are needed to adjust the more than 5000 observations with a series of seventeen successive outbursts defined by 85 parameters of the model .",
    "this fitting procedure allows us not only to define the average outburst s evolution in 3c  273 , but also to study the peculiarities of each individual outburst during the last 20 years .",
    "the main results are the following :    * the quiescent low frequency emission can be understood as being entirely due to the superimposition of slowly decaying outbursts , which flared a few years before , and a constant contribution from the hot spot ( 3c  273a ) of the outer jet . * the values of the indices describing how the physical quantities characterizing the jet evolve with its opening are found to be in general agreement with the simple jet model considered by mg85 .",
    "* the best - fit values of these indices suggest however either that the jet opens slightly less than a conical jet if we assume that the emitting region has a constant bulk doppler factor or , alternatively , that this doppler factor decreases if we impose the jet to be conical . * in both cases , the magnetic field in the emitting region behind the shock front seems to be rather turbulent and the jet flow is found to be nearly adiabatic , especially for the conical jet model .",
    "* the peculiarities of individual outbursts can be understood as being due to changes at the onset of the shock of the magnetic field strength @xmath9 , the normalization @xmath22 of the electron energy distribution and the doppler factor @xmath24 .",
    "* shocks with a high value of @xmath22 have usually a lower value of @xmath24 .",
    "this anti - correlation might be related to the shock efficiency to convert bulk kinetic energy into internal energy of the plasma behind the shock front .    in the past",
    ", shock models were found to be difficult to test and constrain with total flux measurements .",
    "we show here that very strong observational constraints can be derived from long - term multi - wavelength monitoring campaigns .",
    "this new ability , together with interferometric imaging techniques and numerical simulations of shocks in relativistic jets ( e.g. gmez et al .",
    "@xcite ) should lead in a near future to important progresses in the understanding of the physics involved in relativistic jets .",
    "we thank h. tersranta for providing us previously unpublished measurements of 3c  273 at 22 and 37ghz from the metshovi radio observatory .",
    "this research has made use of data from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory which is supported by funds from the university of michigan .",
