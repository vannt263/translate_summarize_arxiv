    "a time - dependent analytical description of particle production from the available relativistic energy in heavy - ion collisions is of considerable interest . in particular ,",
    "the accurate modeling of transverse momentum and rapidity distribution functions for produced particles is a basic requirement in attempts to understand the relevant partonic and hadronic physical processes .",
    "analytically solvable models offer transparent approaches to the problem , including the possibility to extrapolate to other incident energies , such as from rhic energies @xmath2=19.6  200 gev to lhc , @xmath2= 5.52 tev .    in this work",
    "i propose a nonequilibrium - statistical ( and hence , time - dependent ) approach that provides analytical solutions for pseudorapidity distributions of produced particles .",
    "it is based on a nonlinear diffusion equation in rapidity space , which accounts for the explicit dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the rapidity density in the initial short ( @xmath3 0.25 fm / c ) partonic phase of the collision when most of the particles are produced .",
    "this is followed by the somewhat more extended phase of color neutralization @xcite , and a long - lasting color - neutral pre - hadronic or hadronic phase with rapid expansion of the system .",
    "three sources for particle production are considered , two for initial rapidities close to the beam values , and a third central source that arises mostly from gluon - gluon collisions .",
    "i consider the transition from the initial , highly nonlinear partonic phase to the subsequent , essentially linear phase .",
    "other investigations such as @xcite , and references to numerical simulations therein , corroborate the short duration of the parton - production phase , and the long duration of the subsequent recombination ( pre - hadronic ) and hadronic phase . according to parton - cascade models such as @xcite , the pre - hadrons are color singlets that are generated from quark and gluon recombination in a statistical coalescence process .",
    "they decay into the final hadrons according to their relative phase - space weights .",
    "many numerical approaches to the problem use string models in the initial phase , and final - state hadronic collisions , but often hadronic rescattering is not considered .",
    "the second phase lasts about @xmath1 7 - 10 fm / c ( depending on the system , the incident energy , and the centrality ) .",
    "phenomenologically , it is well accounted for in a relativistic diffusion model ( rdm ) based on a linear fokker - planck equation with constant diffusion coefficient , plus fast collective expansion .",
    "the rdm had been developed some time ago @xcite and compared in detail with data on net proton rapidity distributions at sis , ags , sps , and rhic energies , and with produced - particle distributions .",
    "for pseudorapidity distributions of produced charged hadrons , a @xmath4-optimization of the jacobi - transformed analytical solutions yields very precise agreement with the available rhic data provided the midrapidity source for particle production is taken into account .    for net - proton rapidity distributions at rhic energies ,",
    "there have been several investigations of nonlinear effects within the diffusion approach .",
    "a nonlinearity in the drift coefficient that secures the correct maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium limit for @xmath5 has been investigated in @xcite , but the deviations from linearity are small .",
    "the strong effect of a nonlinearity in the diffusion coefficient that also persists over the full interaction time of typically 10 fm / c @xcite as a consequence of the introduction of non - extensive statistics @xcite had been investigated in @xcite for net protons in heavy - ion collisions , and in @xcite for produced particles in @xmath6-collisions .",
    "it seems that this is a way to account for the collective expansion of the system without considering it explicitly .",
    "if one includes an explicit treatment of collective expansion @xcite , however , there is no need to introduce non - extensive statistics when comparing the rdm - results with data , the linear evolution after the parton - production phase yields excellent results for both net baryons , and produced particles .",
    "the linear diffusion model had also been proposed in order to calculate and predict transverse energy distributions of hadrons @xcite , and more recently to calculate transverse momentum distributions of identified hadrons ( neutral pions , as well as negative pions and kaons ) in a nonequilibrium - statistical approach including radial flow @xcite .",
    "equilibrium - statistical models @xcite account in remarkable detail for relative production rates of produced particles at central rapidity with only the temperature and the chemical potential as parameters . due to the lack of time dependence - and",
    "consequently , of nonequilibrium - statistical effects - a relevant ingredient is , however , missing if one aims at the precise modeling of distribution functions .",
    "the gradual approach of the system towards statistical equilibrium in the course of a relativistic heavy - ion collisions is presented in a schematic analytical model in this work .",
    "i start with the nonlinear diffusion model as expected to be valid during the parton - production phase in section [ nonlde ] , followed by a consideration of the so - called source solution of the nonlinear problem in section [ source ] .",
    "for sufficiently large times , the initial power - law behaviour during the nonlinear parton - production phase is superseded by the essentially linear diffusion ( rdm- ) phase in rapidity space which produces gaussian tails in pseudorapidity space , section [ lin ] .",
    "the late - stage time evolution is discussed in a comparison with rhic data for the asymmetric d + au- system , which indeed show the gaussian tails . in an asymmetric system like d+au",
    ", the nonequilibrium effects are visible more directly than in case of symmetric systems such as au + au .",
    "the interaction ceases long before statistical equilibrium with respect to the variable rapidity is reached .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section [ conc ] .",
    "the origin of diffusion during and after particle production in a heavy - ion reaction at relativistic energies is found in momentum space , through random momentum kicks of the produced particles  partons in the soft - gluon field in the early stage , prehadrons and hadrons in later stages .",
    "diffusion in coordinate space appears as a secondary effect .",

    "it is therefore expected to account not only for the long - lasting , essentially linear diffusive phase as in @xcite , but also for the partonic initial phase of high rapidity density . in this short - lived phase",
    "the major part of particle production with rapidly rising norm of the distribution function takes place .",
    "the rising norm is phenomenologically accounted for in this work by letting the integration constant in eq.([nlfpe ] ) depend on particle number .    in case of the linear rdm @xcite with @xmath14=const .",

    "this initial condition is exactly fulfilled only for net baryons @xcite . however , for produced charged hadrons , it also yields extremely precise results when compared @xcite in detail to the data .",

    "the subsequent  probably mostly pre - hadronic and hadronic  evolution in pseudorapidity space during the interaction time of @xmath1 7 - 10 fm / c ( mean duration of the collision ; see @xcite ) is accounted for in the relativistic diffusion model [ 1 ] ( rdm , @xmath19 ) with a linear drift term @xmath20 governed by the rapidity relaxation time @xmath21 and the equilibrium value of the rapidity @xmath22 .",

    "the linear model with instant particle production yields excellent agreement with d+au , cu+cu and au+au data at rhic energies , including the detailed centrality dependence @xcite .",
    "+ the initial short , highly nonlinear phase of parton production occurs within @xmath0 0.25 fm / c @xcite in two beam - like sources , and a central source in rapidity space . since the time scale for particle production in all three sources is faster than the one for the nonlinear diffusion , it turns out that the particle content in the power - law tails remains small : there is little spread of the distribution function in rapidity space in this initial phase .",
    "the mathematical treatment of the initial nonlinear phase is confined to the central source as an example .",
    "the beam - like sources are then dealt with in an analogous way , but with the freedom to choose different diffusion coefficients because the production mechanisms in the valence - quark dominated beam - like regions of rapidity space are different from the central region with few valence quarks at rhic or lhc energies .",
    "kinematic constraints in the beam - like sources expected at high absolute values of rapidity are not considered here .    during the short production phase ,",
    "the drift in @xmath15space is not yet pronounced , and i therefore treat here only the diffusive part of the nonlinear transport equation , @xmath25 with @xmath26 the solution of this equation at the end of the nonlinear production phase ( @xmath27 ) can then be used as initial condition for the subsequent linear diffusive time evolution treated in the relativistic diffusion model ( rdm ) @xcite , @xmath28 with @xmath29 the nonlinear diffusion equation becomes @xmath30 this equation has been extensively studied in many diverse areas of science , and a large amount of mathematical literature exists , @xcite , and references therein .",

    "many problems are dealt with in only one ( spatial ) dimension , analogous to the present work which is confined to one ( momentum - like ) dimension .",
    "it has also been established that the number of exact solutions is limited .",

    "the physically most interesting behaviour occurs in the region of small diffusion coefficients d(r ) , where a moving boundary may exist .",

    "depending on the specific values for the constants of integration ( see below ) , a free boundary may occur for @xmath16 = 1 that has a finite gradient and moves with finite velocity , similarly for other positive values of @xmath16 , but for @xmath37 , the gradient at the boundary becomes infinite .    for @xmath38 and some other negative values , however , there is an instantaneous spread without a free boundary , as was treated by pattle @xcite , pert @xcite hill @xcite and others for instantaneous heat deposition in a medium with concentration - dependent diffusion coefficient .",
    "this situation is in some respect analogous to the initial parton production from the available energy in a relativistic heavy - ion collision . here",
    "the initial rapidity density distribution of the created partons should not have a free boundary in rapidity space , except for kinematical constraints .",
    "hence i investigate solutions for negative values of @xmath16 emphasizing @xmath38 .",
    "an exact solution is not only useful to test the accuracy of numerical results , but it is also important to understand and describe the physical behaviour of the system . in particular , the analytical solution at the end of the initial nonlinear phase may then be used as initial condition for the subsequent , essentially linear diffusion process in @xmath15space which can be modeled analytically within the given simple but successful rdm - framework .",
    "the majority of known exact solutions of the nonlinear problem are so - called similarity solutions @xcite : with an assumed functional form of the solution , the partial differential equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation , or to a partial differential equation of lower order , which can then be integrated in closed form under certain conditions .",

    "the equilibrium state is already closely approached .",
    "the slight asymmetry is due to the conversion from rapidity- to pseudorapidity space which tends to produce a dip at @xmath158 . for time to infinity , statistical equilibrium in pseudorapidity space would be reached .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that with this linear rdm approach , the centrality dependence of the measured pseudorapidity distributions @xcite from central to very peripheral collisions can also be modeled in considerable detail , fig.[fig4 ] . for peripheral collisions ,",
    "the asymmetry of the overall distribution is not yet pronounced because here the d- and the au - like partial distributions are similar in size due to the small number of participants .    towards more central collisions , the number of gold participants rises , and the corresponding partial distribution of produced particles becomes more important .",
    "in addition , the distributions drift towards the equilibrium value . both effects produce the asymmetric shape , which is also seen in minimum - bias .",
    "the tails of the distribution functions are of gaussian shape in perfect agreement with the data .",
    "this shows that the power - law tails of the initial phase have not survived the time evolution , as is confirmed when the result of the initial phase is used explicitly as an initial condition for the linear evolution .",
    "= 200 gev for five different centralities , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "central collisions are shown in the top frame , peripheral at the bottom .",
    "the linear diffusion - model ( rdm ) results for three sources ( d - like source shaded ) in @xmath148space are shown together with their incoherent sums as @xmath159 minimizations at each centrality cut ( c.c . ) .",
    "the time variable is @xmath141 ( see text ) .",
    "the initial conditions for the central source are slightly different from @xcite , see text .",
    "data are from phobos @xcite . reviewed from @xcite.,height=737 ]    it is interesting to compare the behaviour of the rapidity or pseudorapidity distribution functions with results from different approaches to the problem such as saturation models @xcite , viscous hydrodynamics @xcite , or ideal hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "calculations within the framework of the parton saturation model not only predict the midrapidity value , but also the full rapidity distribution function ( at rhic energies , and also at lhc ) @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on a classical effective theory that describes the gluon distribution in large nuclei at high energies where saturation might occur at a critical momentum scale , to form a color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite .",
    "this assumption has a clear and reasonable physical basis and yields good results for pseudorapidity distribution functions of produced charged hadrons at the available rhic energies .",
    "problems may be expected for net - proton rapidity distributions since protons and antiprotons are produced in equal amounts from the cgc . at lhc energies ,",
    "the overall pseudorapidity distribution from the cgc as obtained with the assumption of a constant @xmath160 for strong coupling is slightly narrower than the corresponding diffusion - model prediction @xcite .",
    "additional consideration of a running coupling gives a midrapidity value that is of the order of 10% smaller ; another uncertainty arises from the extrapolation of the saturation scale to lhc energies .",
    "various predictions for central rapidity densities and pseudorapidity distributions at rhic and lhc energies had been summarized e.g. in @xcite , where also the differences among the existing models - including hydrodynamical and pqcd approaches and their numerical implementations - had been discussed .    in relation to these approaches ,",
    "the analytical diffusion model provides good results when compared in detail to the experimental distribution functions at rhic energies , in particular , in the tails of the distributions . to provide a microscopic foundation ,",
    "however , a derivation of the diffusion coefficients in the three sources would be required . due to the valence - quark dominance in the beam - like sources as opposed to the mainly gluonic midrapidity source",
    ", the diffusion coefficients may turn out to be substantially different in the three sources .",
    "i have presented a nonlinear relativistic diffusion model that includes an explicit analytical treatment of the initial parton - production phase in rapidity space . as a consequence of the high rapidity density at short times @xmath161 fm / c ,",
    "the rapidity diffusion coefficient depends on the distribution function , such that the problem is highly nonlinear in the initial phase .    for a power - law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the distribution function with an exponent @xmath16 ,",
    "the mathematical technique of similarity solutions that has been refined in many previous works proves to be useful in the present physical context .",
    "in particular , i have investigated the so - called source solution in rapidity space .",
    "an adequate solution to the nonlinear problem should not have a free boundary in rapidity space that moves with finite velocity as is the case for positive values of @xmath16 , but in parton production there should be an instantaneous spread in @xmath15space without a free boundary .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath57 , which can be solved analytically using the technique of similarity solutions .    during particle production in three sources , the norm of the distribution function increases , which i have considered phenomenologically by letting the integration constant depend on particle number .",
    "since particle production is very rapid - exponentially in time - , this increase of the norm of the distribution function turns out to be faster than the spread of the distribution function in rapidity space due to nonlinear diffusion and hence , the power - law tails of the distribution function remain small during the parton - production phase .    the result of the parton - production phase is then used as initial condition for the later ( pre - hadronic and hadronic ) stage of the collision , which is treated here in the linear relativistic diffusion model .",
    "the linear evolution washes out the initial power - law tails of the distribution function , which become gaussian .    with the proper jacobi transformation to pseudorapidity space",
    ", this approach yields very precise agreement with charged - hadron data for both asymmetric systems ( d+au ) , and symmetric systems such as cu+cu and au+au @xcite .",
    "it is also particularly suitable for predictions at lhc energies of 5.5 tev for pb+pb .",
    "the second collision phase lasts about 7 - 10 fm / c depending on the system , the incident energy , and the centrality . due to the schematic treatment that is based on a linear partial differential equation ,",
    "particle number is conserved in this phase , which appears as a reasonable physical assumption even though it is certainly not strictly valid .    for time to infinity , the evolution of the distribution function proceeds to statistical equilibrium with respect to the variable rapidity or pseudorapidity . comparing the data with this time evolution as modeled by the solutions of the linear problem ,",
    "it is evident that at the time of the measurement - when strong interaction ceases - the system is still far from statistical equilibrium .",
    "this underlines the view that relativistic heavy - ion collisions are very suitable to observe strongly interacting many - body systems with a large amount of particle production on their way to statistical equilbrium .    in this work",
    "i have not considered the connection between the diffusion approach and qcd .",
    "it is obvious that the forward and backward sources for produced particles are related to the valence quarks , whereas the central source is essentially due to gluon - gluon collisions .",
    "an actual microscopic calculation of the three sources emphasizing their relative size ( number of produced particles ) is therefore of interest @xcite .",
    "i thank m. biyajima , t. mizoguchi and n. suzuki for our collaboration within the linear relativistic diffusion model ( rdm ) as presented in @xcite and reviewed here in section 4 , and y. mehtar - tani for discussions and for the derivation of eq .",
