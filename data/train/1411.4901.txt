    "in computational modeling , the contact processes ( cps ) are dynamic systems on discrete media , where the time evolution of a local state towards survival or extinction of particles is determined by the state of the direct neighborhood of a lattice cell or of a network node .",
    "a simple realization is the voter model @xcite , where a particle creates another particle in its direct neighborhood .",
    "cps have been introduced in 1974 as a toy model of spread of epidemic on a lattice @xcite . since then",
    ", they evolved to a frame for models in different areas , from symbiotic interactions @xcite to population @xcite or opinion dynamics @xcite . yet , their important role is also to inspire theoretical considerations on non - equilibrium processes @xcite .",
    "in both these roles , the spectrum of particular realizations of cps has been remarkably enriched .",
    "in particular , the pair contact processes have been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; there , a pair of particles annihilate or create a neighbor particle .    the aim of this paper is to report our numerical results on competing cps of two different kinds .",
    "as far as we know , this case has not been analyzed , with two our texts @xcite as an exception . in literature ,",
    "applications of competing cps are of recent interest @xcite ; yet , in all these approaches the competing processes are of the same kind . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the competition has been investigated between the voter model and the pair contact process without annihilation .",
    "the role of network topology has been analyzed by a comparison of results for the watts  strogatz network @xcite and the erds ",
    "rnyi network @xcite , where the clustering coefficient @xmath8 has been tuned in both networks . our motivation in ref .",
    "@xcite was to evaluate the efficiency of the pair contact process by balancing it with the voter model of controlled efficiency ; the control was kept by tuning the probability @xmath14 of the one - node voter dynamics .",
    "the key result of ref .",
    "@xcite was a phase diagram on the plane ( @xmath22 ) ; below some critical line @xmath23 , the pair process dominates , while above another critical line @xmath24 , the voter dynamics prevails . between these lines , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath25 , the time of relaxation was too long to get a definitive conclusion on the stability of this or that phase .",
    "both critical lines have been found to depend on the network topology .    in paper @xcite",
    ", preliminary results have been reported on the competition between the voter model dynamics and the sznajd model dynamics @xcite .",
    "the latter algorithm bears some resemblance to the pair cp @xcite ; yet , pairs do not annihilate there , and new particles are created at the whole neighborhood of the pair . as the result , we have got a slight dependence of the transition line in the phase diagram ( @xmath22 ) on the initial conditions , _",
    "i.e_. on the initial percentage of nodes in the state activated by the voter dynamics .",
    "as we demonstrate below , this result appears to be generic .",
    "the work presented here is entirely devoted to the role of the initial conditions .",
    "this makes the problem more complex ; the plane @xmath26 to construct the phase diagram is to be substituted by the three - dimensional space @xmath27 .",
    "the next section ( [ sec - model ] ) is devoted to the model and to the details of our simulation procedure .",
    "the section  [ sec - results ] provides our numerical results . in the last section ( [ sec - summary ] )",
    "we give a summary , supplemented by a note on a possible application of the scheme presented here .",
    "the simulations take place on networks similar to watts  strogatz networks @xcite .",
    "the base for network construction is one - dimensional chain of @xmath0 sites , where each site @xmath1 is directly linked to nodes labeled as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "so initially , each node has the same degree @xmath4 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are assumed as well .    for each node @xmath1 the links to sites @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are rewired to two randomly selected nodes so far not - connected to node @xmath1 .",
    "the rewiring procedure occurs with probability @xmath7 .",
    "the examples of original and rewired network are presented in fig .",

    "our numerical results indicate that the time evolution drives the system to a homogeneous state where all nodes belong either to @xmath12- or @xmath13-state .",
    "the boundary between the basins of attraction is a surface in the three - dimensional space of parameters : the clustering coefficient @xmath8 , the probability @xmath14 of the @xmath13-process , and the initial concentration of the @xmath12-nodes .",
    "the boundary consists of unstable fixed points .",
    "the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-3d ] indicate , that the transition between two homogeneous states is most sharp for @xmath69 , _",
    "i.e. _ for the watts  strogatz network without rewiring .",
    "once the rewiring introduces some local disorder , the movement of the boundary between the @xmath12-phase and the @xmath13-phase can be stuck on local configurations , and the related metastable states blur the transition .",
    "the advantage of our method of evaluation of the activity of a contact process by counterbalancing it by another contact process is that we get a stationary state which is not a frozen absorbing state , but a result of a dynamic equilibrium .",
    "the ` another process ' plays a role of a scale , which allows to compare different processes ; if a new process appears , its comparison with the voter dynamics allows to evaluate its efficiency with respect to all processes which had been previously compared with the voter model .",
    "also , we evade the method of quasistationary state , which limits the statistics to surviving trials @xcite .",
    "some possible applications of pair processes have been listed already in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we want to add one , related to computer viruses @xcite .",
    "namely , the direct competition of the processes considered above can find a counterpart in an algorithm of correcting codes in a network of cp units . the algorithm could be applied to cure the losses made by destructive viruses , which randomly change data .",
    "once two neighboring computers compare their versions and find them the same , they can safely share this version with all units connected to the pair , because it is unlikely that errors are found at the same place .",
    "once they find that their versions are different , both units should be treated as unsafe .",
    "our results indicate , that the effectiveness of the algorithm depends on the network topology , and in particular on the clustering coefficient .",
