    "starting from @xcite , one can easily verify that the legendrian statement also holds for center - chord ias , but here we prove this explicitly in a way that highlights the similarities between the center - chord and the special ias .",
    "in the center - chord case , we also comment on the boundary singularities , or `` on - shell '' singularities , that appear in the limit of vanishing chords and have a special symmetry , as described in @xcite .",
