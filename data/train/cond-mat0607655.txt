    "the traditional _ trapping _ problem involves diffusive ( brownian ) particles ( @xmath0 ) that wander in a medium doped with static traps ( @xmath1 ) and disappear when they meet  @xcite . in the traditional _ target _ problem  @xcite , on the other hand , one has static @xmath0 particles and mobile traps . both of these problems are described by the  reaction \" @xmath2 , but in one case the @xmath0 s move and the @xmath1 s stand still , while in the other the @xmath1 s move while the @xmath0 s are stationary .",
    "both of these problems have a long and active history in the literature .",
    "they not only represent experimentally observable phenomena , but they have served as a testbed for theoretical and numerical studies and as a starting point for the formulation of models for more complex systems that have only recently been successfully solved analytically . for example , the survival probability of an @xmath0 particle in a medium of @xmath1 particles when _ both _ species are diffusive , first investigated numerically in the seminal work of toussaint and wilczek  @xcite , was only partially solved analytically  @xcite until the recent full ( asymptotic ) solution in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "these results have also recently been generalized to subdiffusive species  @xcite .",
    "the survival probability of @xmath0 particles in the reactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 in one dimension when @xmath0 is mobile is also of relatively recent vintage in the history of such analytic solutions  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the one - dimensional target problem calculations for both diffusive and subdiffusive traps to the case of traps that themselves disappear in time according to some survival probability function of their own ( e.g. , exponential or power law ) .",
    "the decay of the moving traps with time of course increases the survival probability of the stationary target , and the interesting questions concern the interplay of the time dependences of the movement and decay of the traps .",
    "a related problem was considered in  @xcite , where diffusive particles @xmath0 and traps @xmath1 and @xmath5 undergoing the explicit reactions ( a ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and ( b ) @xmath6 , @xmath8 were considered using entirely different methods .",
    "our methods are equally applicable to trap densities that increase with time , but this problem is less interesting because it necessarily leads to the eventual demise of the target .",
    "a common characterization of the diffusive motion of a particle is through its mean square displacement for large @xmath9 , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the ( generalized ) diffusion constant , and @xmath12 is the exponent that characterizes normal ( @xmath13 ) or anomalous ( @xmath14 ) diffusion . in particular , the process is sudiffusive when @xmath15 .",
    "subiffusive processes are ubiquitous in nature  @xcite , and are particularly useful for understanding transport in complex systems  @xcite .",
    "the problem considered in this paper is a special case of a broad class of reaction-_subdiffusion _ processes that have been studied over the past decades .",
    "one approach that has been used to study these processes is based on the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) theory with waiting - time distributions between steps that have broad long - time tails and consequently infinite moments , @xmath16 for @xmath17 with @xmath15 .",
    "another approach is based on the fractional diffusion equation , which describes the evolution of the probability density @xmath18 of finding the particle at position @xmath19 at time @xmath9 by means of the fractional partial differential equation ( in one dimension )  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the riemann - liouville operator , @xmath22    in this paper we study the one - dimensional target problem for a static particle @xmath0 subject to attack by diffusive or subdiffusive traps @xmath1 that may die before reaching the target @xmath0  @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we generalize the ideas of bray and blythe  @xcite , and of our own work  @xcite based on a fractional diffusion equation approach .",
    "while recent work shows that a simple generalization of reaction - diffusion to reaction - subdiffusion equations in which the reaction and subdiffusion terms are assumed to enter additively is not valid in some cases  @xcite , this is not a difficulty in our particular application .",
    "the difficulties do not arise when the reaction process can be translated into a static boundary value problem , which is the case for the target ( as well as the trapping ) problem @xcite .    in some cases ,",
    "asymptotic anomalous diffusion behavior can be found from corresponding results for normal diffusion via the simple replacement of @xmath9 by @xmath23 .",
    "this can be understood from a ctrw perpective because the average number of jumps @xmath24 made by a subdiffusive walker up to time @xmath9 scales as @xmath25 and , in many instances the number of jumps is the relevant factor that explains the behavior of the system .",
    "the simple replacement result is evidence of `` subordination '' ( see secs . 5 and 7.2 of  @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are other instances where the behavior of subdiffusive systems can not be found in this way .",
    "a simple example is the survival probability of subdiffusive particles in the trapping problem ( see sec .",
    "5 of  @xcite ) . in particular , for systems where competing processes ( motion toward target and death ) occur according to different temporal rules , such a replacement becomes ambiguous .",
    "this is the case for the problem considered here .",
    "while our analytic results are based on the fractional diffusion equation formalism , our numerical simulations are based on a ctrw algorithm .",
    "these two renditions of the problem are expected to differ if trapping events are likely in a small number of steps , that is , if the initial density of traps is too high . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial trap density is too low , then the simulations to produce valid statistics would take inordinately long because trapping events are rare and because the system has to be sufficiently large to include many particles .",
    "we note this as a caveat for our subsequent comparisons .    in sec .",
    "[ survival1 ] we present an integral equation for the survival probability , which we reduce to quadrature in sec .  [ survival2 ] .",
    "the resulting integral is explicitly evaluated for exponentially decaying trap densities ( including a stretched exponential decay ) , as well as for trap densities that decay as a power law .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that a sufficiently rapid decay of the trap density leads to a finite asymptotic survival probability of the target . comparisons of our results with numerical simulations are also shown in this section . a summary and some conclusions",
