    "there has been growing interest lately in quantum spin systems with frustrated interactions.@xcite of special importance are models in this category for which it is possible to construct an exact ground state .",
    "the first example of such a representation is the well - known majumdar - ghosh model.@xcite it comprises a chain of spins  1/2 with antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 of nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor spins , where @xmath2 . the ground state of this model is two - fold degenerate and consists of dimerized singlets ; moreover , there is a gap in the spectrum of excitations .",
    "another example of an exactly solvable model is the one - dimensional model with bilinear and biquadratic interactions and spin  1 , investigated by affleck , kennedy , lieb , and tasaki@xcite ( aklt model ) .",
    "its ground state has a structure of the type where each neighboring pair of spins has valence bonds .",
    "it is not degenerate , the spin correlation functions in the ground state decrease exponentially with distance , and there is a gap in the spectrum of excitations .",
    "this model therefore has properties predicted by haldane@xcite for the one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with spin  1 .",
    "the valence - bond ground state is also exact for systems with many dimensions , but with spin @xmath3 ( _ d _ is the coordination number of the lattice).@xcite the one - dimensional aklt model has subsequently been generalized and investigated in a number of papers,@xcite where it has also been shown that the wave function of the ground state can be represented by the trace of the product of matrices describing the spin states of sites of a chain ( the `` matrix '' form ) .",
    "these two examples are characterized by the fact that the total hamiltonian of the model is written as a sum of cell hamiltonians ( which are not mutually commuting ) , and the exact ground - state wave function of the total system is the eigenfunction having the lowest energy of each cell hamiltonian .",
    "we have previously@xcite investigated an exactly solvable , one - dimensional , frustrated model with spin  1/2 , whose properties by and large are similar to those of the aklt model .",
    "the ground - state wave function has a special recursion formula , and we have shown that it can be reduced to matrix form .",
    "it must be noted , however , that both the recursive form and the matrix form are essentially one - dimensional constructions and can not be extended directly to higher - dimensional systems .",
    "we cite ref .   in this regard , where a method has been proposed for constructing an exact wave function of the ground state for models with spin 3/2 on a hexagonal lattice .",
    "the same method is applicable to other systems with spin  @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we consider a class of models with spin  1/2 for which the exact wave function of the ground state can be represented in an alternative form . in the one - dimensional case",
    "this wave function reduces to a wave function that we have found previously,@xcite but it admits generalization to higher - dimensional systems .",
    "the present study is devoted primarily to an analysis of the two - dimensional model .",

    "below we write the wave function @xmath8 in a form more suitable for subsequent generalization to other types of lattices and give the general form of the hamiltonian for which @xmath8 is an exact wave function of the ground state .",

    "the wave function of this system is described by the _ n_th - rank spinor @xmath10 where the indices @xmath11 correspond to different projections of the spin  1/2 .",
    "we partition the system into pairs of nearest neighbor spins .",

    "the second - rank spinor describing the pair of spins  1/2 can be written in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are symmetric and antisymmetric second - rank spinors , respectively , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are arbitrary constants .",
    "we know that the symmetric second - rank spinor describes a system with spin  1 , so that the pair of spins  1/2 in this case forms a triplet . if @xmath22 is an antisymmetric second - rank spinor reducible to a scalar multiplied by @xmath23 , the spin pair exists in the singlet state .",

    "this happens if the site spinor @xmath62 reduces to a product of two second - rank spinors , each describing two spins  1/2 .",
    "for example , @xmath110 in this case the hamiltonians @xmath41 and @xmath89 contain interactions of four rather than eight spins  1/2 and have the form  ( [ e16 ] ) .",

    "consequently , the matrix _",
    "r _ also contains at most 70 elements .",
    "if we regard the elements of _ r _ as boltzmann vertex weights , the problem of calculating the norm reduces to the classical 70-vertex model .",
    "since the exact solution for the 70-vertex model is unknown , numerical methods must be used to calculate the norm and the expected values .    to calculate the above - indicated expected values , we carry out monte carlo calculations on @xmath120-site lattices .",
    "as mentioned , the ground - state wave function of the model depends on 14 parameters and , of course , can not possibly be analyzed completely .",
    "we confine the numerical calculations to the case in which the spinor @xmath121 depends on one parameter  @xmath122 : @xmath123 where @xmath124 $ ] , the spinor @xmath125 is symmetric with respect to all indices , and @xmath126    in this case we have a one - parameter model with two well - known limiting cases .",

    "the spin correlation function therefore has the form @xmath130    in determining the spin structure of the ground state , however , it is more practical to consider the more straightforward quantity  @xmath131 : @xmath132    the function @xmath131 is left unchanged by a change of sign of @xmath133 .",
    "this invariance is attributable to the fact that the spinor @xmath134 does not contain a quintet component , so that all the functions of this spinor are orthogonal to all functions of the symmetric spinor @xmath135 for all @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",

    "a more detailed analysis shows that 19 multiplets are present in the wave function of two nearest neighbor sites . in this case",

    "our results suggest that the spin correlation functions decay exponentially with a correlation length @xmath55 for an arbitrary parameter @xmath122 .",
    "we also assume that the decay of the correlation function is of the exponential type for the 14-parameter model as well , i.e. , for any choice of site spinor @xmath62 .",

    "the wave function ( [ e7]),([e19 ] ) can be generalized to any type of lattice .",
    "the general principle of wave function construction for a system of spins  1/2 entails the following :    \\1 ) each bond on a given lattice has associated with it two indices running through the values 1 and 2 , one at each end of the bond .",

    "\\4 ) the wave function is the product of all spinors at sites of the lattice and all metric spinors .",
    "it is obvious that each index in the formulated wave function is encountered twice , so that the wave function is scalar and , hence , singlet .",
    "the wave function so constructed describes a system in which each lattice site contains as many spins @xmath4 as the number of bonds emanating from it .    to completely define the wave function ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the specific form of all site spinors .",
    "the coefficients that determine their form are then parameters of the model .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a model is the sum of the cell hamiltonians acting in the spin space of the subsystem formed by the spins at two mutually coupled sites : @xmath182    each cell hamiltonian is the sum of the projectors with arbitrary positive coefficients onto all multiplets possible in the corresponding two - site subsystem except those present in the constructed wave function : @xmath183 then @xmath184 and , accordingly , @xmath185 .",
    "consequently , @xmath16 is an exact ground - state wave function .",
    "we note that any two lattice sites can be joined by two , three , or more bonds , because this does not contradict the principle of construction of the wave function .",
    "moreover , the general principle of construction of the wave function is valid not only for translationally symmetric lattices , but for any graph in general . as an example , let us consider the system shown in fig .",
    "the wave function of this system has the form @xmath186 and describes a system containing ten spins  1/2 .",
    "( 11,6 )    if the given lattice has dangling bonds ( as occurs for systems with open boundary conditions ) , the resulting wave function represents a spinor of rank equal to the number of loose ends .",
    "the ground state of this kind of system is therefore @xmath187-fold degenerate ( where _",
    "l _ is the number of loose ends ) . for an open one - dimensional chain , for example",
    ", the ground state corresponds to four functions  one singlet and three triplet components . for higher - dimensional lattices",
    "this degeneracy depends on the size of the lattice and increases exponentially as its boundaries grow .",
    "we have proposed a method for the construction of an exact wave function for a class of two - dimensional spin models . in general this model",
    "depends on 14 parameters , and its hamiltonian is written as the sum of the hamiltonians of nearest neighbor spin quartets .",
    "the exact ground - state wave function of the total system is also the exact wave function of each cell hamiltonian . since 20 of the 70 multiplets of two nearest neighbor quartets",
    "are present in the exact wave function , the cell hamiltonians are the sums of the projectors with positive coefficients onto the other 50 multiplets .",
    "these coefficients are the excitation energies of the corresponding multiplets .",
    "different values of the coefficients correspond to different hamiltonians . in this case , however , the ground - state wave function itself and the spin correlation functions in the ground state are identical for all hamiltonians .",
    "this means that the ground - state wave function , as defined by shastry and sutherland,@xcite is superstable .",
    "we have carried out monte carlo calculations of the spin correlation functions in the ground state for the special case of a model that depends on one parameter .",
    "for all values of the parameter the spin correlation functions decay exponentially with distance despite the complicated dependence of the correlation functions of nearest neighbor spins on the model parameter .",
