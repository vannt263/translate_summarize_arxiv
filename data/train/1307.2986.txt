    "galactic ob star counts , pulsar birth rates , iron abundance and estimates of supernova rates in local group galaxies suggest that there should be more than 1000 supernova remnants ( snrs ) in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , only 274 are presently cataloged @xcite .",
    "this lack of detection is partly due to poor angular resolution of existing surveys which disfavors detection of small diameter snrs @xcite that future surveys with upcoming facilities @xcite could address .",
    "supernova rate in our galaxy is about 2.8 per century @xcite .",
    "hence , in the last 400 years more than ten supernova explosions have taken place in the galaxy . however , only two of them ( cas a and g1.9 + 0.3 ) have been reported .",
    "there are only three snrs of angular size @xmath31.5@xmath0 listed in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "they are g1.9 + 0.3 , g54.1 + 0.3 and g337.0@xmath40.1 . among them , g1.9 + 0.3 has been shown to be the youngest known snr @xcite in the galaxy with age of about 150 years . the snr g54.1 + 0.3 is centrally powered by a pulsar and the size of the emission region is 1.5@xmath0 .",
    "the actual size of the outer shell is unknown @xcite and hence the remnant age could be much more than a few hundred years .",
    "the size of the snr g337.0@xmath40.1 has been measured to be 5 pc @xcite , that suggests it to be a candidate young snr .",
    "the line of sight towards the galactic center passes the longest distance through the galaxy , that enhances the probability of detecting an snr .",
    "therefore , we had conducted observations of a few regions close to the galactic center ( gc ) with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at 330 mhz @xcite .",
    "the main objective of these observations was to confirm the nature of certain candidate snrs . from one of these fields ,",

    "note that the flux densities of the shell and the diffuse emission at 330 mhz given in table  1 were measured from the large scale sensitive map shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the flux density of the diffuse emission decreases significantly at 330 mhz as compared to 1.4 ghz and this indicates self absorption . for a typical extended source in the galaxy , self absorption at meter wavelengths",
    "is caused by bremsstrahlung process .",
    "no significant free - free absorption by the line of sight gas is likely at 330 mhz as significant optical depth of this gas is observed only at @xmath3100 mhz @xcite .",

    "the flux density ( s ) of an object is related to its brightness temperature in radio frequency ranges by @xmath26 where , @xmath27 is the solid angle and @xmath28 is the brightness temperature of the diffuse emission . in case of bremsstrahlung emission , the brightness temperature of the emission is related to the thermal electron temperature ( @xmath24 ) by @xmath29 we note that significant decrease of flux density of the diffuse emission at 330 mhz ( table  1 ) indicates significant optical depth at this frequency . however , the measured value of @xmath28 for the hii region at 330 mhz ( using table  1 ) is only about 500 k. as this temperature would be comparable to the galactic background temperature at 330 mhz , correction due to absorption of the galactic background radiation by the hii region needs to be made .",
    "we measured the galactic background temperature from @xcite 408 mhz single dish map convolved to the primary beam of the gmrt at 330 mhz and scaled to the same frequency assuming a spectral index of @xmath42.7 for the sky brightness temperature .",
    "the measured temperature is 700 k towards the hii region .",

    "5 is fitted to the observed flux densities of the diffuse hii region to measure its physical properties ( @xmath24 , @xmath23 ) .    at 843 mhz and 4.8 ghz",
    ", the contribution of the shell could not be separated from the diffuse emission .",
    "therefore , estimation of flux densities of the diffuse emission at these two frequencies depend on the actual flux density of the shell emission that in turn depends on its location with respect to the diffuse hii region .",
    "therefore , we consider below three possible configuration of the shell with respect to the hii region , thereby allowing us to constrain the spectral index of the shell .      from the plot of the flux densities of the shell and the diffuse emission ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we note the slopes of their flux densities between 1.4 ghz and 330 mhz are very different , indicating the shell type object and the diffuse emitting region are two different objects . when the shell is at the center of the hii region , its emission undergoes absorption by the diffuse hii region at 330 mhz and the intrinsic spectrum of the shell is steeper than the observed one as given in table  1 .",
    "by assuming the diffuse emission to be optically thin ( @xmath42 ) at 843 mhz and above , and an intrinsic spectral index of @xmath40.5 for the shell ( typical for a shell type snr @xcite ) , we estimate its flux densities at 843 mhz and 4.8 ghz from its measured flux density at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the estimated flux densities are then subtracted from the total measured flux densities of the complex at the above two frequencies to get the flux densities of the diffuse emission .",
    "if we know the distance to the hii region , @xmath31 could be estimated from our measured temperature of @xmath43  700  k towards g354.4 + 0.0 . here , we assume the shell structure and the diffuse hii region is located nearly at the distance of the galactic center , but is at the near side of the gc ( discussed in detail in sect .",
    "3.3 ) . due to expected high density of massive stars in the gc region ,",
    "it is likely that most of the galactic non - thermal emission is generated in the region .",

    "consequently , the electron density in the diffuse emitting region is estimated to be 44@xmath71 @xmath48 .",
    "this gas will have a @xmath20 of about 0.4 at 330 mhz .",
    "given the relative location of the shell with respect to the diffuse emission , the emission from the shell would undergo free - free absorption with @xmath20 being half of that of the ionized gas and @xmath49 percent of its emission would be absorbed at 330 mhz .",
    "moreover , its brightness temperature and consequent flux density is underestimated in table  1 due to high large scale diffuse galactic background ( eq .  4 ) .",
    "given the angular cross - section used ( 4.4 square arc - min ) to measure its flux density ( table  1 ) and @xmath31 of 700 k at 330 mhz , the flux density that was underestimated in table  1 at 330 mhz is 0.28 jy . once this flux density is added with the observed flux density of the shell at 330 mhz , and correction is made for the fraction that was absorbed by the diffuse hii region , its estimated flux density at 330 mhz",

    "therefore , the polarization vectors representing electric field direction in fig",
    ".  1 should be cross - radial or tangential to the shell in the absence of any faraday rotation .",
    "we note the resolution of the nvss ( 45@xmath11 ) is not much smaller than the size of the shell .",
    "this causes smearing of any change of the polarization vectors with change in position on the shell . from fig .  1",
    ", we note the polarization vectors in the northern part of the shell lies along the shell , while only fraction of the polarized vectors in the southern part lies along the shell . assuming magnetic field strength in the diffuse hii region to be of typical ism value of @xmath510 @xmath69gauss and the snr at the center of the hii region , given the electron density and the path length through the ionized gas , any polarized emission from the snr would undergo faraday rotation by @xmath560 radian at the observing wavelength of nvss .",
    "faraday rotation towards the northern part need to be @xmath70 ( @xmath71 @xmath4 integer ) radian to explain the observation .",
    "it is possible that the faraday rotation towards the southern part of the shell is slightly different than the northern part of shell , and this causes a change in direction of the observed polarization vectors from the tangential direction of the shell .",
    "future polarization observations at three or more frequencies with high angular resolution will be able to measure faraday rotation accurately and could show whether the shell lies inside or in front of the hii region .",
    "if the snr is located outside the hii region , it is then expanding in typical ism .",
    "given the assumed distance and the angular size of the remnant , it will be in the free expansion stage .",
    "hence , the structure of the shock front and the corresponding shock acceleration of energetic particles would not depend significantly on the structure of the ism in which it is expanding .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron emission from the shell should roughly be circularly symmetric",
    ". however , the shell appears fragmented towards east , and only some parts of it are seen in fig .  1 .",

    "given the angular size and the distance to the snr ( @xmath58 kpc ) , its linear diameter is about 3.7 pc .",
    "if it is within the dense hii region , given its @xmath23 , the snr has swept up about 20  @xmath72 of material from the surrounding ism during its expansion .",
    "kinetic energy of ejecta from a supernova explosion lies in the range of @xmath73 ergs @xcite .",

    "type of the progenitors and the explosion , the as the mass of the swept up material in this case is comparable to or more than the typical ejected mass from supernova explosion , there will be appreciable slowdown of its expansion .",
    "this phase of expansion is known as the adiabatic phase @xcite , and given the morphology discussed above , the snr is likely expanding in a denser than ism environment . assuming energy conservation between the supernova ejecta and the swept up material and given the range of initial ejecta mass",
    ", the age of the snr is estimated from numerical integration of @xmath76 considering its slow down due to expansion in the dense environment .",
    "the range of age possible for this remnant is found to be @xmath5100@xmath4500 years .",
    "we note that the @xmath24 of 2300 k determined in sect .",
    "3.2 is low for a typical hii region , that is typically 5000@xmath410000 k. however , wim with temperatures of 3000 k has been reported @xcite and unstable wim can reach temperatures much lower @xcite .",
    "moreover , averaging of flux densities within the angular size of the source with likely spatial variation of electron density leads to an underestimation of source temperature @xcite .",
    "even if we assume @xmath24 is a factor of three higher ( 7000 k ) , estimated value of @xmath23 being mainly dependent on higher radio frequency emissions ( @xmath771 ghz ) , it will only increase by a factor of 1.2 .",
    "this does not significantly change the evolutionary phase of the snr .",
    "if a pulsar was created during the supernova explosion , given their typical velocity of a few hundred km  s@xmath63 @xcite , it would be seen within @xmath78 arc seconds from the center of the remnant .",
    "however , no pulsar is known within several arc - minutes of the object .",
    "this could be caused by ( i ) a type - ia explosion that does not leave behind any neutron star , ( ii ) lack of beaming of any pulsar in the region towards us , or ( iii ) lack of sensitive survey with suitable dedispersion of the pulses at the right dm ( the diffuse hii region itself would contribute a dm of about 400 @xmath48  pc ) .",
    "when an snr expand inside a dense ism , it is expected to be brighter .",
    "for example , in m82 , where emission measure of foreground gas towards the snrs in that galaxy is about four orders of magnitude higher than the medium around g354.4 + 0.0 shell @xcite , the typical surface brightness of snrs of the diameter of g354.4 + 0.0 are a few hundred times more @xcite . in our galaxy ,",
    "such a brightening has also been observed for snrs interacting with molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "however , particle density in the diffuse hii region is much less than that of typical molecular clouds and that may explain why this snr is not that bright .",
    "moreover , there is more than an order of magnitude spread of surface brightness from what is predicted by @xmath79 relation @xcite .",
