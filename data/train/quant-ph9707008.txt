    "the scaling - law eq .",
    "( [ eq:30 ] ) derived above for the  wichmann - kroll in uehling ",
    "part @xmath98 may only be useful as test for its complete numerical calculation . in order to employ the scaling - law the first - order uehling correction @xmath99 and the wichmann - kroll charge density @xmath100 need to be determined .",
    "this can be achieved by means of very accurate numerical procedures developed earlier ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for a discussion of technical details encountered with the evaluation of @xmath86 we refer to @xcite .",
    "the total induced negative charge number @xmath101 is obtained by integrating the wichmann - kroll density from the origin @xmath102 up to @xmath103 where @xmath86 changes its sign . table [ t:1 ] gives numerical results for the first - order uehling correction , the induced negative charge number and for the corresponding energy shifts @xmath98 according to the scaling - law for the @xmath7s - ground state of hydrogen - like lead and uranium respectively .",
    "the energy correction is repulsive , since the induced charge is negative .",
    "let us compare the effect of the higher - order contribution to the two - loop correction @xmath54 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) with the one obtained in uehling approximation @xmath104 .",
    "the latter is tabulated in the first column of table [ t:2 ] for k- and l- shell electrons in hydrogen - like lead and uranium .",
    "this uehling - in - uehling contribution is attractive and amounts to less than @xmath105% of the total klln - sabry correction to the lamb shift as tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the results for the exact two - loop correction are tabulated in the second column of table [ t:2 ] .    in comparison with the exact numerical results for the wichmann - kroll - in - uehling contribution as presented in the third column of table [ t:2 ] the scaling - law indeed gives the right order of magnitude but leads to a systematic overestimation due to the neglection of the long - range tail of @xmath86 .",
    "the numerical results for the wichmann - kroll - type contribution @xmath106 , which have been obtained according to the representation ( [ eq:24b ] ) , are presented in the last column of table [ t:2 ] . as for the uehling - in - uehling correction this contribution carries the same overall sign ,",
    "i.e. it also acts attractive .",
    "it comprises about @xmath107 % of the two - loop diagram evaluated in uehling approximation .",
    "this result also indicates that higher - order ( @xmath5 ) contributions to the one - loop polarization insertion of the photon propagator may be not small compared with the uehling approximation .",
    "accordingly , it may be not surprising at all , if the higher - order contribution to the s(vp)e - correction ( see fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] ) may turn out to be important as well .    even in the case of uranium",
    "the order of magnitude for the total higher - order part @xmath108 ( see table [ t:2 ] ) is about @xmath109 ev for the 1s - state , which indicates that the effect of the higher - order contributions to the two - loop vacuum polarization alone are far too small to be detected via lamb - shift measurements with current accuracies .",
    "furthermore , this correction is about one order of magnitude below the natural limitations for tests of qed set by nuclear polarization effects @xcite",
    ". it might also be instructive to compare this effect with the uncertainties of the @xmath7s - energy level caused by the uncertainties in the determination of the nuclear radii .",
    "the rms - radius for uranium is given by @xmath110 fm @xcite and leads to an uncertainty of about @xmath111 ev .",
    "although a complete numerical evaluation of the exact klln - sabry diagrams , i.e. , the higher - order contributions of the self - energy - corrected one - loop diagram vpvpc remain to be performed , the goals of this paper have been achieved : 1 .",
    "we have presented a calculational scheme for evaluating the two - loop vacuum polarization corrections to all orders in the interaction with the external coulomb potential .",
    "the problem is reduced to the evaluation of an effective one - loop correction .",
    "thus , the partial wave decomposition can be employed in a similar way as it has been used successfully in calculations of the ordinary first - order vacuum polarization correction .",
    "2 . numerical results for exact two - loop vacuum polarization correction to the lamb shift of k- and l - shell electrons in hydrogen - like lead and uranium have been obtained .",
    "it turns out to be below the natural limits set by nuclear polarization effects and by the uncertainties of nuclear parameters .",
    "3 . although the effect of the higher - order contributions to the two - loop diagram turn out to be small a further uncertainty in lamb - shift calculations has been eliminated .",
    "aiming for a relative precision of @xmath6 of theoretical predictions of the binding energy we conjecture that the still unknown exact two - photon self energy corrections remain the major source of uncertainties .",
