    "it is an intriguing subject to study the effects and mechanisms of the absence of dominated splittings on homoclinic classes .",

    "in @xcite , bonatti and daz and pujals proved , @xmath4-generically , absence of dominated splittings implies the @xmath4-newhouse phenomenon , i.e. , locally generic coexistence of infinitely many sinks or sources .",
    "these results tells us that the study of wild homoclinic classes are fertile .    in @xcite ,",
    "inspired by @xcite , aiming to the understanding of the mechanisms of the wilderness , the problem of the index sets of wild homoclinic classes is treated .",
    "let us review the problem .",
    "for a homoclinic class @xmath63 , its index set , denoted as @xmath64 , is defined to be the collection of integers that appear as the index ( dimension of unstable manifold ) of some hyperbolic periodic point in @xmath63 . in that article , it is proved that , under some assumption on jacobian , @xmath4-generically , the index set of three dimensional wild homoclinic classes contain all possible indices , namely , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the result sounds quite reasonable if one recalls the idea of the argument in @xcite : the wilderness of a homoclinic class scatters its hyperbolicity to any direction .",
    "so it is plausible one can construct periodic points with prescribed indices by mixining the hyperbolicity with small perturbations .    in this article , we give an example that says this naive idea has some limitation in higher dimensionnal cases .",

    "this theorem says that a wild homoclinic class may have index deficiency .",
    "more precisely , it is not always true that one can construct a saddle with any prescribed index , even in the sense of @xmath4-generic viewpoint .",
    "let us introduce the idea of the proof .",
    "the idea of assuring the wilderness of the homolcinic class is nothing new .",
    "one can find a similar idea in @xcite .",
    "the novelity of our argument is the way to assure the non - existence of periodic points whose indices are not equal to @xmath65 .",
    "the naive idea is simple : if the diffeomorphism strongly expands some two dimensional subspace of the tangent space at each point inside the homoclinic class , then each three - dimensional subspace must be volume - expansive .",
    "in particular , no periodic points inside the homoclinic class has index @xmath65 .",
    "let us discuss the conditions we work on .",
    "we work on the category of the @xmath4-diffeomorphisms of four - dimensional manifolds .",
    "this environment is choosen only because this is enough for our purpose to present a example of a wild homoclinic class with index deficiency .",
    "it is natural to wonder what happens in higher regularity and higher dimensional manifolds .",
    "however , the complete treatise that covers general cases requires complicated descriptions and most of them do not seems to be essential .",
    "so we give up treating general cases and concentrate on this special environment .",
    "we want to discuss one technical issue .",
    "theorem [ mainth ] says that we can construct an example of generically wild homoclinic class . in the article such as @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "they did not treat generically wild homoclinic classes but wild homoclinic classes .",
    "the difference is not so serious for the following reason : we can re - prove many results that holds for wild homoclinic classes starting from generically wild homoclinic classes .",
    "for example , we can get generically wild homoclinic classes version of the result in @xcite with little modification .",
    "yet the following question might be interesting in itself :    * question . *",
    "are generically wild homoclinic classes wild ?    for instance , it is an interesting question whether our example is wild or not .",
    "we would like to argue this problem in another time .",
    "finally , we explain the organization of this article . in section 2 , we deduce our problem to a local problem and we describe the abstruct conditions that are sufficient to guarantee the properties we claimed in theorem [ mainth ] .",
    "section 3 is the hard part of this article .",
    "we construct a diffeomorphim that satisfies the condition listed in section 2 .",
