    "in this paper we are interested in finite dimensional approximations of solutions of scalar and vectorial divergence form equations with rough coefficients in @xmath1 , @xmath6 . more precisely , in the _ scalar case _ , we consider the partial differential equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a bounded subset of @xmath9 with a smooth boundary ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is symmetric and uniformly elliptic on @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are uniformly bounded from below and above by two strictly positive constants , denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "it follows that the eigenvalues of @xmath25 are uniformly bounded from below and above by two strictly positive constants , denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    the analysis of finite dimensional approximations of scalar divergence form elliptic , parabolic and hyberbolic equations with rough coefficients that in addition satisfy a cordes - type condition in arbitrary dimensions has been performed in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "global harmonic coordinates are used as a coordinate transformation .",
    "we also refer to the work of babuka , caloz , and osborn @xcite in which a harmonic change of coordinates is introduced in one - dimensional and quasi - one - dimensional divergence form elliptic problems .",
    "in essence , this harmonic change of coordinates allows for the mapping of the operator @xmath29 onto the operator @xmath30 where @xmath31 is symmetric positive and divergence - free .",
    "this latter property of @xmath31 implies that @xmath32 can be written in both a divergence form and a non - divergence form operator . using the @xmath33 regularity of solutions of @xmath34 ( for @xmath35 ) ,",
    "one is able to obtain homogenization results for the operator @xmath36 in the sense of finite dimensional approximations of its solution space ( this relation with homogenization theory will be discussed in detail in section [ kjkgjkjgkjgjhg ] ) .    this harmonic change of coordinates provides the desired approximation in two - dimensional scalar problems , but there is no analog of such a change of coordinates for vectorial elasticity equations .",
    "one goal of this paper is to obtain an analogous homogenization approximation without relying on any coordinate change and therefore allowing for treatment of both scalar and vectorial problems in a unified framework .    in section [ sec1 ]",

    "this transfer / mapping property will replace the transfer / mapping property associated with a global harmonic change of coordinates .    in section [ jkgjkhgjgu ] , we show that a simple and straightforward application of the flux - norm transfer property is to obtain finite dimensional approximation spaces for solutions of and with `` optimal '' approximation errors independent of the regularity and contrast of the coefficients and the regularity of @xmath41 .",
    "another application of the transfer property of the flux norm is given in section [ lkjlsdhkj ] for controlling the approximation error associated with theoretical discontinuous galerkin solutions of and .",
    "in this context , for elasticity equations , harmonic coordinates are replaced by harmonic displacements .",
    "the estimates introduced in section [ lkjlsdhkj ] are based on mapping onto divergence - free coefficients via the flux - norm and a new class of inequalities introduced in section [ inequalities ] .",
    "we believe that these inequalities are of independent interest for pde theory and could be helpful in other problems .",
    "connections between this work , homogenization theory and other related works will be discussed in section [ kjkgjkjgkjgjhg ] .",
    "in this section , we will introduce the flux - norm and describe its properties when used as a norm for solutions of ( and ) .",
    "this flux - norm is equivalent to the usual @xmath42-norm ( or @xmath43-norm for solutions to the vectorial problem ) , but leads to error estimates that are independent of the material contrast .",

    "these modifications on the energy norm or on the error bounds ( expressed in the energy norm ) have to be introduced because , in the presence of high contrast in material properties , the energy norm blows up . even in the simple case where @xmath11 is a constant ( @xmath62 with @xmath63 ) ,",
