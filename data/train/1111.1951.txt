    "this paper expands the concept of generalised cesaro convergence introduced in [ 1 ] and uses this to introduce a notion of generalised root identities . in turn",
    "these identities are used to investigate both the asymptotic behaviour and the geometric distribution of roots and poles of the gamma function , @xmath2 , and the riemann zeta function , @xmath3 .    in section 2.1",
    "we introduce the core notion of `` remainder '' cesaro summation / convergence , where the partial - sum function analysed via a cesaro scheme is now on a contour relative to chosen point @xmath7 , rather than always being on @xmath8 . as an initial example",
    "we show that the hurewicz zeta function , @xmath9 , is defined naturally in this context , and that well - known relationships among bernoulli polynomials follow naturally within this remainder cesaro approach .    in section 2.2 this",
    "is extended in the usual way to a notion of remainder cesaro products and , when applied to the elementary case of @xmath10 , is used to give a cesaro definition of the gamma function , @xmath2 , at least after ensuring that the geometric location of terms in the remainder sum / product is respected in the cesaro analysis .    in section 2.3",
    "we demonstrate the utility of this remainder cesaro approach , and in particular its geometric intuitiveness when coupled with the dilation - invariance of cesaro convergence , in analysing three example results .",
    "the first is an elementary derivation of the duplication formulae for @xmath2 ; the second is the derivation of the functional equations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by exploiting symmetries in the cesaro context to introduce bi - directional sums which are apriori periodic and thus amenable to fourier series analysis ; and the third is a short derivation of an interesting integral identity for @xmath9 .    in section 3",
    "we then turn to the question of root identities , and in particular the possibility of generalising the well - known identities relating roots and coefficients of polynomials to some more general class of functions .    in section 3.1 a family of such identities , for arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "are initially derived on a formal , heuristic basis . in general , these equate a quantity defined in terms of the derivatives of a function ( the `` derivative side '' ) with a quantity defined in terms of the roots of the function ( the `` root side '' ) .",
    "the latter quantity in fact includes equally contributions from roots ( with multiplicity @xmath13 ) , poles ( with @xmath14 ) and even branch points ( with e.g. @xmath15 ) of a function ; all of which cases are thus subsumed thereafter under the label of `` generalised roots '' .",
    "a natural equivalence is then established between satisfying the root identities at a single @xmath16 , and satisfying them at arbitrary @xmath11 ( at least an open neighbourhood ) for @xmath17 alone .",
    "unfortunately it is readily seen that most non - polynomial functions do not satisfy these generalised root identities .",
    "however , at least for those where the discrepancy is sufficiently well - behaved ( as a function of @xmath7 ) , we show that it is possible to find an `` equivalent '' function with the same root - set which does satisfy these identities .",
    "the construction of this equivalent function by iterative removal of obstructions to the successive ( @xmath18 ) root identities at a given fixed @xmath7 is outlined .    in section 3.2",
    ", however , we verify that in practice many natural and important functions do already satisfy these identities with no , or minimal , adjustment by considering three examples which will become primary focuses of attention in this article . in the first",
    "we show that @xmath19 satisfies the identities for all @xmath11 and all @xmath12 and we note that this leads naturally to evaluation of some values of @xmath3 , for example euler s famous evaluation of @xmath20 . in the second",
    "we verify that @xmath21 also satisfies the root identities for all @xmath11 and all @xmath12 , albeit in the case of @xmath17 that a renormalisation is required on the root side to handle uniformly the ln - divergences which arise for any @xmath7 and which do not have cesaro limits . in the third",
    "we find that @xmath3 alone does not satisfy the root - identity for @xmath17 , but see by experimentation using the first @xmath22 non - trivial zeros that the obstruction in this case appears to be a constant , @xmath23 , independent of @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that instead @xmath25 does satisfy the @xmath17 root identity for all @xmath24 and we find that in fact this is true and reflects a well - known explicit formula for @xmath3 which represents the hadamard product formula for @xmath26 .",
    "thus , in this case , the generalised root identity for @xmath17 is equivalent to the hadamard product formula ; for @xmath27 the extra factor @xmath28 no longer contributes on either the derivative or root sides and so @xmath3 itself then satisfies these identities for all @xmath24 directly .    in section 3.3",
    "we then turn to the possibility of further generalising our root identities by allowing @xmath0 to be not just a positive integer , but @xmath29 arbitrary , with the cases of @xmath1 being of particular interest .",
    "we begin by discussing extensively how to even make sense of the identities in the case of arbitrary complex @xmath0 . on the root side a generalised convergence scheme - always cesaro in this",
    "paper - is required to make sense of what are now usually divergent sums , and we find that it is crucial that the summands , @xmath30 , in this cesaro context be added in geometrically at the shifted points @xmath31 . on the derivative side the notion of @xmath32 now becomes problematic ; we note various basic properties it should have and then define it consistently with these via fourier theory , in a manner familiar from pseudodifferential operators .    as a first example of the value of this generalisation to arbitrary complex @xmath0 we give",
    "a short derivation showing that , for our example of @xmath19 , @xmath33 satisfying the generalised root identities for all @xmath7 and all @xmath29 is equivalent to the functional equation for @xmath3 . with this as indication of the utility of this extension , we then discuss these generalised identities in the particular cases of @xmath1 where the @xmath34 factor becomes singular . for the remainder of the paper ,",
    "in fact , we shall ignore the case of arbitrary @xmath29 and focus exclusively on @xmath1 . in this case",
    "we show how to interpret our derivative - side definition via a distributional interpretation of the expressions @xmath35 and note that in fact it is this singular behaviour that generally makes calculation of the derivative sides more tractable for @xmath1 than for arbitrary @xmath29 since it allows omission of hard - to - compute finite integral contributions , leaving only these distributional contributions .",
    "we then discuss at some length why , for a function @xmath33 satisfying the generalised root identities , the identities for @xmath1 should naturally give us much more information than the corresponding cases of @xmath12 both about the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath33 and about the asymptotic and geometric distribution of its roots .",
    "we conclude section 3.3 with a quick overview of the initial formal fourier theory results that we will use in the remainder of the paper , which is concerned with analysing the implications of the generalised root identities for our remaining two key examples , @xmath21 and @xmath36 .",
    "in section 3.4 we consider the case of @xmath21 .",
    "we first verify that @xmath21 does in fact continue to satisfy the root identities for all @xmath1 by explicit calculation of both the root sides ( using cesaro ) and derivative sides ( using fourier and distributional calculations ) in these cases .",
    "then , as an example of the asymptotic information contained within the identities for @xmath1 we show how , for this example of @xmath2 , we can use them to deduce stirling s theorem describing the asymptotics of @xmath21 .",
    "we do this in an engineering fashion by successively using the identities for @xmath37 to construct the next order in the stirling asymptotics .",
    "we show , using the generating function which defines the bernoulli numbers , why the stirling formula in turn leaves the root identities for @xmath12 in tact , without need of further correction terms to remove obstructions in these cases .",
    "finally , we conclude section 3.4 with some discussion of why our derivation of stirling s theorem in fact implies a `` two - sided '' result giving stirling - like asymptotics also as @xmath38 , in addition to the actual stirling asymptotics as @xmath39 . we use the functional equation for @xmath2 to verify that this is indeed the case , but with specific additional `` one - sided '' asymptotic contributions as @xmath38 , albeit ones which did not derail our derivation above .    in section 4",
    "we then turn to consideration of the generalised root identities for @xmath1 for @xmath3 . in section 4.1",
    "we consider the derivative sides of these identities and demonstrate that in fact they are all identically zero for all @xmath24 when @xmath1 .",
    "this is done by using the euler product formula for @xmath3 together with a basic property of @xmath40 to in fact derive an explicit formula for the derivative side as a sum over primes @xmath41 .    in section 4.2 ,",
    "which then takes up the bulk of the remainder of the paper , we consider the cases of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath6 in turn on the root sides with a view to seeing whether these root sides can likewise be seen to be identically zero for all @xmath24 in spite of not knowing the exact location of the non - trivial roots ; and indeed whether any asymptotic or geometric information can be gleaned on the location of these non - trivial zeros from the requirement that the root - sides be zero in these cases .    in section 4.2.1",
    "we consider the case of @xmath42 , in section 4.2.2 the case of @xmath43 , and in section 4.2.3 the case of @xmath6 . in all cases",
    "the evaluation of the root - sides proceeds by considering first the trivial roots , t , then the simple pole and finally the non - trivial roots , nt .    as expected , the majority of the effort is in the computations for the contributions from nt .",
    "here we rely on the explicit riemann - von mangoldt formula for @xmath44 , the function which counts non - trivial roots with imaginary parts between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; this expresses @xmath44 as the sum of three pieces @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the leading asymptotic part of @xmath44 , @xmath49 is the famous argument of the riemann zeta function , and @xmath50 is a completely explicit function giving the negative order asymptotics of @xmath44",
    ". the calculations of the root - side contribution from nt always thus further subdivide into calculations of the cesaro limits for the terms arising from each of these three pieces . in carrying out these cesaro computations",
    "we confirm that it is absolutely critical when @xmath1 both ( a ) to respect the location of the roots in determining the geometric placement of summands and ( b ) to independently carry out computations for the nt - roots above and below the real axis using separate parameters @xmath46 and @xmath51 ( and associated geometric complex variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , but to recombine these into a 2-d partial sum function ( of @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) before taking limits .",
    "failure to do so leads to incorrect evaluation and paradoxes involving apparent inconsistency between the results for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath42 in section 4.2.1 we verify that we do indeed have the root - side identically zero for all @xmath24 , at least after assigning cesaro limit @xmath45 to a residual 2-d log - term , @xmath54 ( with this latter seemingly ad hoc calculation either following from a suitable 2-d cesaro analysis , or alternatively to be treated as a consequence of the root identity for @xmath42 , allowing it at least to be used confidently for the subsequent cases of @xmath43 and @xmath6 where it also arises ) .",
    "we return to address it again and justify why assigning this 2d cesaro limit the value @xmath45 is legitimate ]    for @xmath43 in section 4.2.2 we likewise verify that we do indeed have the root - side identically zero for all @xmath24 , at least subject to an estimate on @xmath49 which is known to hold conditional on the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) .",
    "for @xmath6 in section 4.2.3 , however , we find that a symmetry of the nt - roots is broken .",
    "for @xmath42 and @xmath43 the fact that any non - trivial roots off the critical line occur in mirror pairs meant that the net contributions from any such pairs to our cesaro calculations was exactly as for a corresponding double - root on the critical line , and so no explicit terms expressing potential contributions from departures from the critical line arose .",
    "but for @xmath6 there is such a term , @xmath55 , and after carrying out the analogous , albeit more intricate , computations for the root side in this case we find that the value of the root - side for @xmath6 is given by @xmath56 .    in order for the @xmath6 root identity to hold",
    ", this would need to be identically zero and this allows us to conclude section 4.2.3 by inferring , as a consequence , that the riemann hypothesis must be false .    given the nature of this claim , we end by including a final section , section 4.3 , itemising and discussing the admittedly many areas where the arguments in the paper up to this point have been informal , heuristic or otherwise in need of more rigorous treatment .",
    "we nonetheless note that , while our emphasis throughout the paper is on developing and applying calculational tools rather than on formal rigour , we believe the nature of the resulting computations is sufficiently suggestive that we are convinced of their correctness , and certainly convinced that they warrant further analysis to try to fill the gaps .",
    "finally we note that , for those wishing to focus as rapidly as possible on the calculations for @xmath3 , section 2.3 and the discussion of stirling s theorem in section 3.4 may be omitted en route .",
    "in this paper we use the definition of bernoulli numbers as given recursively by    @xmath57    which implies @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and so on .",
    "for @xmath62 we have @xmath63 and the even - index bernoulli numbers are related to the values of @xmath3 at negative odd integers by @xmath64 .",
    "a generating function for the @xmath65 is given by    @xmath66    bernoulli polynomials are then defined by    @xmath67    and are monic polynomials satisfying @xmath68 . since @xmath69 we alternatively let @xmath70 be the periodic , period-1 extensions of the bernoulli polynomials from @xmath71 $ ] to all of @xmath72 .",
    "for @xmath73 these are differentiable and satisfy @xmath74 , and this relationship continues to hold for @xmath75 except at the integer points ( of measure @xmath45 ) where @xmath76 is defined to have value @xmath45 .",
    "the first few @xmath77 and @xmath70 are given by    @xmath78    and so on where @xmath79 is the fractional part of @xmath80 .",
    "we denote by @xmath81 the polynomials in @xmath82 given by the sums of @xmath83 powers :    @xmath84    which turn out to be closely related to the bernoulli polynomials .",
    "we take the fourier transform and inverse fourier transform to be defined by    @xmath85(\\xi)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)\\cdot\\textrm{e}^{-ix\\xi}\\,\\textrm{d}x\\qquad\\textrm{and}\\qquad\\mathcal{f}^{-1}[g](x)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}g(\\xi)\\cdot\\textrm{e}^{ix\\xi}\\,\\textrm{d}\\xi\\ ] ]    finally we denote the odd heaviside function by @xmath86 so that    @xmath87 while @xmath88 denotes the standard heaviside function    @xmath89",

    "since the eigenfunctions of @xmath92 , namely @xmath98 with eigenvalue @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , arise naturally in the euler - mclaurin asymptotic expansion for the partial sums of the riemann zeta series , @xmath101 , generalised cesaro summation can be used ( see [ 1 ] ) to derive the analytic continuation of @xmath3 to @xmath102 .",
    "while various `` schemes '' were considered in [ 1 ] , for @xmath3 the cleanest extension arose from a geometric cesaro approach in which a partial sum function ( of a real variable ) is obtained by adding in each term @xmath103at the point @xmath104 .",
    "it is more natural , however , to view this analysis in [ 1 ] as a special case of remainder cesaro summation in which contributions occur at points located relative to an initial point @xmath11 .",
    "specifically , given a function @xmath105 we wish to define its strict remainder sum at @xmath11 by@xmath106(z_{0}):=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}f(z_{0}+n)\\label{eq : remsum}\\ ] ] where we want to understand the sum on the rhs in a generalised cesaro sense along the horizontal contour @xmath107 .",
    "adapting the working definition in lemma 4 in [ 1 ] , we do this by adopting the following working definition of cesaro convergence along a contour :    [ [ definition-1 ] ] definition 1 : + + + + + + + + + + + + +    _ suppose _ @xmath108 _ is a contour parametrised by arc length _",

    "it is not hard to see uniqueness of limits in definition 1 .",
    "\\(ii ) it is critical in this definition , and will be crucial throughout this paper , that the functions @xmath123 that we `` throw away '' ( i.e. assign generalised cesaro limit @xmath45 for @xmath124 ) are functions of the _ geometric _ variable @xmath125 , not just the arc - length parameter @xmath109 ; we continue to think of these as cesaro eigenfunctions and generalised eigenfunctions in this setting even though this association is now loose given the necessary definition of @xmath92 in terms of @xmath109 rather than @xmath52 .",
    "of course , in the case where @xmath126 the need for this distinction disappears , at least when @xmath112 is a simple ray as per ( i ) , since in this case a straightforward taylor expansion allows expression of each @xmath123 as a linear combination of functions of the form @xmath127 with all @xmath128 , and vice - versa . when @xmath129 is an integer , however , this distinction becomes pivotal in order to avoid pure powers of @xmath130 , which correspond to cesaro `` eigenfunctions '' with eigenvalue @xmath131 and thus have no generalised cesaro limit ( see [ 1 ] , section 2 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) in relation to this last remark , recall the key point that cesaro definition of generalised convergence is fundamentally intended as a tool for constructive analytic continuation ( in @xmath7 and some parameter @xmath29 which drives the values of the @xmath129 s in the situation being analysed ) . as such , the above distinction could be rephrased as saying that when all @xmath126 the definition 1 can be recast , at least for @xmath112 a ray , purely in terms of the parameter @xmath109 ( and then fully justified rigorously in terms of genuine eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a regular polynomial in @xmath132 ) ; but when @xmath0 is such that there is a @xmath133 we find that we need to distinguish between @xmath52 and @xmath109 as per the discussion in ( ii ) in order to obtain the correct analytic continuation across this value of @xmath0 .",
    "\\(iv ) when @xmath112 is just a horizontal ray then , for @xmath7 real , definition 1 devolves simply to the case considered in [ 1 ] and so simply represents a natural extension of the definition in [ 1 ] to achieve the desired constructive analytic continuation from @xmath72 to @xmath134 just mentioned . the case of vertical rays",
    "can be viewed similarly .",
    "while the motivating example of remainder summation in ( [ eq : remsum ] ) leads to a partial sum function with evenly spaced jumps , the function @xmath33 in definition 1 obviously need not have any jumps or even arise from a summation process , or even if it does , may arise in a way where the spacing between summands is not even .",
    "\\(v ) we will return briefly to discuss definition 1 and the above observations ( i)-(iv ) further in the final section of the paper , by which stage the intervening calculations will hopefully have both demonstrated the utility of this definition and clarified the meaning and significance of some of these comments ( which may seem obscure at present ) .",
    "however , since our primary focus in this paper is on calculation , we defer further discussion here and simply conclude by summarising definition 1 into the following `` working recipe '' for calculation of generalised cesaro limits along contours , as it will be used throughout the paper to perform the constructive analytic continuation ( in @xmath7 and @xmath0 ) just mentioned :    \\(a ) first remove linear combinations of cesaro eigenfunctions and generalised eigenfunctions , but critically doing so geometrically as eigenfunctions in @xmath125 , rather than simply @xmath109 , and then    \\(b ) apply a suitable power of the cesaro averaging operator `` along the contour '' ( i.e. averaging in the contour arc - length @xmath109 ) .",
    "returning now to the case of remainder summation in ( [ eq : remsum ] ) , here we form the contour @xmath107 , form the partial sum function @xmath135 and use definition 1 to obtain @xmath136(z_{0})$ ] as @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and we have used the notation @xmath139 rather than @xmath140 to emphasise that it is eigenfunctions in @xmath52 rather than @xmath109 that we remove from @xmath141 prior to averaging as discussed above .    in similar fashion we define @xmath142(z):=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}f(z+n)$ ] , @xmath143(z):=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}f(z - n)$ ] , @xmath144(z):=\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(z+n)$ ] and so forth . in the last case with a bi - directional sum , the definition is via two independent cesaro sums , for @xmath145 and @xmath146 respectively .    in the case of @xmath147",

    "as a first simple example of the flexibility allowed by letting @xmath156 and moving to the remainder cesaro viewpoint , consider in this context the polynomials in @xmath157 defined in section 1.1 by @xmath158 .",
    "these are related by formal differentiation of the discrete summation variable , @xmath159 , namely @xmath160 from which they may be readily recursively generated and shown to be connected to the bernoulli polynomials @xmath77 .",

    "utilising the fact that we may now rigorously differentiate with respect to @xmath52 and that @xmath164 ( after noting that summation and differentiation may be commuted in this case in a careful cesaro analysis ) we immediately obtain the claimed relationship on setting @xmath165 .",
    "a second way in which remainder summation immediately expands the scope of analysis is that @xmath166 ( and @xmath146 etc ) are now operators on functions and thus amenable to spectral analysis .",

    "note , however , that it is critical in the above cesaro analysis that summands are introduced geometrically at @xmath178 and cesaro eigenfunctions are then viewed w.r.t .",
    "this geometric variable @xmath179 , rather than simply the summation index @xmath180 ; this need to respect the geometric location of summands in the cesaro setting will be crucial later in this paper .",

    "other basic identities for @xmath2 ( and for other functions ) likewise follow directly from geometric considerations within the cesaro viewpoint .      to conclude section 2 we briefly give three examples to illustrate the way geometry can be exploited in the remainder cesaro framework .",

    "we proceed with the other terms : @xmath498 gives integrand contribution @xmath499and each term @xmath500 gives integrand contribution @xmath501 ( by ( [ eq : fourierresults1 ] ) ) .",

    ", we can use the logarithmic version of the functional equation for @xmath2 in ( [ eq : lngammafunceqn ] ) to deduce the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath434 as @xmath38 from its known behaviour as @xmath381 from stirling s theorem .",

    "thus , overall , as @xmath38 , we have    @xmath521    we see that , as predicted , we do have the same asymptotic behaviour as per stirling s theorem also when @xmath38 , except that in addition we have the linear and constant terms shown ( @xmath522 and @xmath523 respectively ) and the term @xmath524 which contains a countable collection of ln - divergences at the negative integer points .    the reason our above derivation of stirling s theorem nonetheless worked in spite of these extra one - sided terms as @xmath38 is that , owing to the @xmath366 factors on the derivative side of our root identities , the contributions made by these terms on this derivative side for @xmath1 are @xmath45 .",
    "we shall omit calculations demonstrating this here , but note that in general terms this reflects the fact that it is asymptotic behaviour within a log - scale , rather than local divergences ( even a countable collection of them ) , that matter in the computation of the derivative side of the root identities for @xmath1 .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath336 while @xmath337 , so that again we obtain the same value of @xmath338 for the obstruction .",
    "this suggests , along the lines discussed before , that while @xmath3 does not directly satisfy the generalised root identities ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) for @xmath17 , the function @xmath25 may well do so .",
    "this conjecture can be expressed in a different way .",
    "recall that the functional equation for @xmath3 given in ( [ eq : zetafunceqn ] ) can be re - expressed as simply@xmath339 since the generalised root identities ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) hold for @xmath340 and @xmath334 ( as discussed in example 2 ) , and since a product of functions satisfying these identities will also satisfy these identities , so the conjecture that @xmath25 satisfies them for @xmath17 and arbitrary @xmath24 is equivalent to having @xmath341 satisfy ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) for @xmath17 and arbitrary @xmath24 .",
    "in fact this conjecture turns out to be true . in light of the discussion of @xmath2 in the previous example it is equivalent to the following corollary which can be found in [ 4 , pg35 ] :    [ [ theorem-1 ] ] theorem 1 : + + + + + + + + + +    _ let _",
    "@xmath317 _ denote the set of non - trivial zeros of _ @xmath3 , _ and _ @xmath342 _ denote the subset with imaginary part _ @xmath343 _ then , with sums understood to include multiplicities , we have _",
    "@xmath344    thus , overall , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy the generalised root identities ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) for @xmath17 and arbitrary @xmath24 , and hence also for arbitrary @xmath345 . since the factor @xmath28 only contributes to the root identities when @xmath17 , note that for @xmath345 the root identities will in fact be satisfied directly by @xmath3 ( which can of course be readily spot - checked experimentally ) .    note that , as discussed in [ 4 ] , this corollary is in fact the expression of the hadamard product formula for @xmath341 ( which is a holomorphic integral function of order @xmath131 ) .",
    "we thus see that the generalised root identity ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) for @xmath17 is in this case equivalent to the hadamard product formula for @xmath341 .",
    "since the identities for @xmath345 are just derivatives of the @xmath17 identity , they will contain no additional information , but we turn now to considering cases of more general @xmath0 , in particular @xmath1 , in the hope that they will lead to new tools with additional content beyond the hadamard identity .      in ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) our current root identities",
    "constitute a generalisation from the case of polynomials , relating derivatives of @xmath346 at @xmath7 to sums of integer powers of shifted reciprocals of ( generalised ) roots of @xmath33 .",
    "it is natural , however , to ask whether they can be further generalised by allowing @xmath0 to be an arbitrary complex number rather than just a positive integer ; that is@xmath347    the lhs here we call the derivative side of the root identity and denote by @xmath348 ( or just @xmath349 if the context is clear ) .",
    "the rhs is the root side and is denoted by @xmath350 ( or just @xmath351 ) , and ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) is interpreted as asserting identity of these two functions of two complex variables .",
    "of course , in attempting such an extension the question immediately arises of how to interpret either side of ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) :    ( a)(i ) to overcome the potential divergence of the sum on the root side ( e.g. when @xmath352 becomes negative ) the rhs must be interpreted via a generalised convergence scheme , which analytically continues the rhs from its region of convergence in the @xmath0-plane . in all cases in this paper",
    "this will be a generalised cesaro scheme .",
    "( a)(ii ) in implementing this cesaro approach , the sum on the root - side will need to be interpreted geometrically .",
    "specifically , each term @xmath30 must be added in at the shifted point @xmath31 itself in the complex plane ( rather than , for example , always being added in at @xmath268 itself ) .",
    "thus , as @xmath7 varies , not only do the summands vary , but their locations move too",
    ". we shall emphasise this by writing @xmath353 on the rhs in ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) .",
    "( b)(i ) on the derivative side in ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) , the interpretation of @xmath32 also becomes problematic .",
    "two facts that should hold in any such definition , however , are that@xmath354 and@xmath355 we shall formalise the definition of the lhs of ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) in a manner consistent with these criteria below .",
    "first , however , we demonstrate the extra power obtained from this extension of the generalised root identities to arbitrary complex @xmath0 by showing how the full functional equation for @xmath3 , given in ( [ eq : zetafunceqn ] ) , follows very simply from applying them to the function @xmath19 considered before in example 1 in section 2.1 . for in this case , taking @xmath150 in ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) we have@xmath356",
    "while for @xmath357 we have@xmath358 so that setting @xmath359 we obtain@xmath360 which is precisely ( [ eq : zetafunceqn ] ) . thus the functional equation for @xmath3 is equivalent to @xmath292 satisfying the generalised root identities ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) ( after also extending easily to the case of @xmath17 ) .    with this example as a motivation , and ( [ eq : muderiva ] ) and ( [ eq : muderivb ] ) as guidance , we formalise the meaning of the complex derivative @xmath32 in the lhs of ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) via fourier theory , in a manner familiar from linear partial differential operators , as follows :    ( b)(ii)writing @xmath33 as the inverse fourier transform of its fourier transform , namely@xmath361 we define @xmath362 by@xmath363(\\xi)\\textrm{e}^{iz_{0}\\xi}\\textrm{d}\\xi\\label{eq : complexderivdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with ( a)(i ) , ( a)(ii ) and ( b)(ii ) the generalised root identities ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) now have a well - defined meaning for arbitrary complex @xmath0 .",
    "we have considered their interpretation for @xmath19 and will examine them next for @xmath21 and @xmath36 , but first we make several general observations about these identities and their potential uses :    \\(i ) while the cases of @xmath264 give information on the sums of integer powers of shifted reciprocals of roots , ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) gives a much more sensitive relationship between the distribution of these roots and the behaviour of the derivatives of the log of the function .",
    "\\(ii ) in paricular , for @xmath42 , ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) should give information about the cesaro count of the roots ( adding @xmath267 at each point @xmath364 ) , while for @xmath365 we get information regarding the cesaro sums of first , second and higher powers of these roots . in particular , taking @xmath352 sufficiently negative should give information about the asymptotic distribution of the roots and the cases @xmath1 will be of particular interest .",
    "\\(iii ) for @xmath1 , however , it is immediately clear that further care will need to be taken in ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) owing to the poles of @xmath2 in the factor @xmath366 on the lhs . at first glance",
    "these appear to make the @xmath348 always zero whenever@xmath1 which seems problematic ( e.g. in interpreting the case @xmath42 as yielding a count of roots ) .",
    "thus , in general , we will need to interpret ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) distributionally , and for @xmath1 the distributional result we shall rely on in this paper is the following fact ( see hrmander s treatment in [ 3 , pp74 ] ) regarding the function@xmath367 and its normalised counterpart @xmath368 :    [ [ lemma-3 ] ] lemma 3 : + + + + + + + +    _ for _ @xmath369 _ _ we have__@xmath370 _ where _ @xmath371 _ is the usual delta distribution_.    \\(iv ) the fact that ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) naturally gives ( cesaro ) asymptotic information about the distribution of the roots of @xmath33 makes it a natural tool with which to investigate this asymptotic behaviour . another way of looking at this is to compare with the case of ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) in which @xmath0 was restricted to @xmath372 . from an experimental point of view , since for any positive integer @xmath0 the rhs of ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) or ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) diverges as @xmath7 approaches any finite root @xmath268 , so the cases of such positive integer @xmath0 give a tool for detecting the location of finite roots by looking at the dominant behaviour of these identities as we let @xmath7 approach such a location . they give little immediate guidance , however , about how the root locations behave asymptotically as they tend to @xmath373 .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath42 the rhs in ( [ eq : genrootidv2 ] ) is clearly insensitive to the location of finite roots , but its cesaro calculation depends critically on the asymptotic location of the roots as they approach @xmath373 ; and the same is qualitatively true for @xmath374 .    in part",
    "this in turn reflects the non - locality of the derivatives @xmath32on the lhs whenever @xmath375 , which can briefly be seen by considering an alternative approach to defining such derivatives , namely : let @xmath376 be the operator of translation by @xmath277 ( i.e. @xmath377(z)=g(z+h)$ ] ) .",
    "since @xmath378 , so in general formally@xmath379 it is only for @xmath12 that this series definition truncates and leaves a purely local resulting function ; for all other @xmath0 the resulting function , @xmath380 , depends on @xmath291 as @xmath381 and so is intrinsically non - local .",

    "this can be viewed in a different way by thinking of @xmath7 fixed and @xmath269 successively .",
    "taking @xmath150 for example , if the lhs and rhs of ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] ) differ by @xmath285 for @xmath17 then we can remove this `` obstruction '' by multiplying @xmath33 by @xmath286 since this leaves the root side undisturbed and contributes the required @xmath285 to the derivative side .",

    "note that if the error function , @xmath291 , obstructing the @xmath17 identity for @xmath33 is not entire , then the situation becomes more complex .      in reality the root identities ( [ eq : genrootidv1 ] )",
    "hold without any need for adjustment for many well - known functions .",
    "we next briefly consider three examples .",
    "in the case of @xmath3 , of course , we do not know the location of the non - trivial roots in advance and so our perspective must change . unlike for @xmath2 , where we calculated values for the root - sides of the generalised root identities by cesaro means and used these to infer information about asymptotic behaviour of @xmath2 from the derivative sides ( e.g. stirling s theorem ) , we now aim to calculate the derivative sides of the generalised root identities for @xmath1 and thereby to investigate the location of the roots of @xmath3 by utilising cesaro methods on the corresponding root sides , noting in particular that these cesaro methods naturally depend critically on the geometric location of summands .      in this case , for @xmath3 , it turns out that there is no need to do detailed calculations on the derivative side using the fourier definition ; all that is required is the property ( [ eq : muderiva ] ) of @xmath40 .",
    "recall the euler product formula for @xmath3 , namely    @xmath525    which is convergent for @xmath152 .",
    "it follows that    @xmath526    and so , in light of property ( [ eq : muderiva ] ) , we have that for @xmath527 the derivative side of the root identity for @xmath3 at @xmath0 is given by    @xmath528    this expression is clearly convergent for arbitrary @xmath0 for @xmath527 and so gives an expression for the derivative sides of the root identities for @xmath3 for arbitrary @xmath29 and @xmath527 , which can then be extended also to @xmath529 by unique analytic continuation .",
    "since , for arbitrary @xmath527 the sum in ( [ eq : zetaderivsideeuler2 ] ) converges to some finite value as @xmath530 for any @xmath531 , and since @xmath2 has simple poles at all the non - positive integers , so a corollary of the result in ( [ eq : zetaderivsideeuler2 ] ) is the following :    [ [ lemma-4 ] ] lemma 4 : + + + + + + + +    _ when @xmath1 the derivative sides of the generalised root identities for _ @xmath3 _ are all identically zero as functions of @xmath24 _ ; _ that is _    _ @xmath532 _",
    "since @xmath3 satisfies the generalised root identities , we should therefore have also    @xmath533      we now try to calculate the root sides of the generalised root identities for @xmath3 for the cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 in order to verify ( [ eq : zetarootsideidenticallyzeromunegint ] ) in these cases .",
    "first we consider the trivial roots t. for @xmath323 we get the cesaro sum of @xmath534 placed at the points @xmath535@xmath425 . by dilation invariance , this equals the cesaro sum of @xmath534 placed at the points @xmath536@xmath425 and this is familiar from [ 1 ] as giving @xmath196 . for @xmath537",
    "this becomes instead the cesaro sum of @xmath534 placed at the points @xmath538@xmath425 which thus immediately leads to the value @xmath539 , and so in general to arbitrary @xmath24 to derive ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu0_t ] ) here is deliberately heuristic , for reasons of brevity , but the result & similar deductions for the trivial root contributions when @xmath43 and @xmath6 are easy to deduce rigorously by cesaro means if desired ]    @xmath540    next , from the simple pole at @xmath250 we get contribution @xmath541 ( since @xmath314 here ) .",
    "now , for the contribution from the non - trivial roots , nt , in the critical strip we recall the explicit form of the riemann - von mangoldt counting function , @xmath44 , which counts roots @xmath542 with @xmath543 . by karatsuba - korolev",

    "we are interested in finding the cesaro limit of @xmath44 as @xmath549 , at least after combining with the corresponding calculation for the roots below the real axis ; i.e. , writing @xmath51 for the parameter tracing our count of roots with negative imaginary parts , we have    @xmath550    now , by [ 5 ] we know that @xmath551 , and by either [ 5 ] or gordon - sabeh in [ 6 ] we also know that if we define @xmath552 in the usual way , then @xmath553 so that @xmath554(t)=\\frac{s_{1}(t)}{t}\\rightarrow0 $ ] and @xmath555 . thus ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu0_nta ] ) reduces to    @xmath556    as we have seen , however , in considering this cesaro limit , we need to be adding in 1 for each root counted , not at the root @xmath318 itself but at @xmath557 , and this geometry will be critical in our computations , as will the need to combine @xmath48 and @xmath558 before taking cesaro limits ( in particular we will shortly need this to resolve an apparent paradox between results for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) . to reflect this geometry we thus write    @xmath559    so that    @xmath560    and therefore    @xmath561    and    @xmath562    here we are for the moment assuming that , at least for purposes of calculation of cesaro limits , we may treat the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 as running purely along the critical line in enumerating the non - trivial zeros .",
    "we shall discuss this assumption ( which would of course be justified if the riemann hypothesis is true , and may be justified in any case by symmetry of roots around the critical line ) further later .",
    "thus we have    @xmath563    and therefore    @xmath564    we see that taking care to place the nt roots relative to @xmath24 by considering @xmath52 rather than @xmath46 introduces the extra terms of @xmath565 and @xmath566 ( which cancels the @xmath567 to @xmath568 ) in the constant term .",
    "if we add an equivalent constant - term contribution from @xmath558 , arising from the roots in nt below the real axis , we get a constant term of @xmath569 , precisely as required to cancel the contributions from the trivial roots in ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu0_t ] ) and from the simple pole and leave the root side of the @xmath42 root identity with value @xmath45 as hoped - i.e.    @xmath570 in agreement with ( [ eq : zetarootsideidenticallyzeromunegint ] ) .",
    "however , there is a subtlety here and we must be careful . if we consider ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu0_ntd ] ) alone then , recalling the dilation invariance of cesaro limits ( so that @xmath571 leaves limits unchanged ) and the fact that @xmath171 and @xmath52 are both pure cesaro eigenfunctions ( with eigenvalue @xmath325 ) and thus have generalised cesaro limit @xmath45 , it follows that    @xmath572    but the term @xmath573 has a pure log - divergence which means that , on its own , it has no generalised cesaro limit . here",
    ", however , we see again the importance of being careful in both the geometric placement of roots and in considering the sum of @xmath48 and @xmath558 before taking the cesaro limit , with @xmath51 critically being treated as independent of @xmath46 .",
    "specifically , if we carefully mimic the calculations for ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu0_ntd ] ) for @xmath558 in terms of @xmath53 instead , taking account of the sign changes in ( [ eq : zetarootside_zdefinitionb ] ) and ( [ eq : zetarootside_zdefinitiond ] ) vis - a - vis the corresponding results for @xmath52 , we end up with the corresponding relation    @xmath574    in ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu0_ntc ] ) we thus have , on noting ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu0_nte ] ) and its analogue for @xmath575 that    @xmath576    as discussed , on combining with the results for t and for the simple pole , we will thus have the desired result that , for @xmath424    @xmath577 if and only if we have that    @xmath578    but this is true in spite of the non - cesaro - convergence of either @xmath301 or @xmath579 in the 1-d cesaro setting because , as a 2-d function , @xmath580 can be ascribed a cesaro limit and this limit is @xmath45 . to see this",
    "we first observe that @xmath581 is a direct eigenfunction of the 2-d cesaro operator , @xmath582 , with eigenvalue @xmath131 , since    @xmath583=p_{1d}[\\ln z]-p_{1d}[\\ln\\tilde{z}]=(\\ln z-1)-(\\ln\\tilde{z}-1)=\\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{\\tilde{z}}\\right)\\ ] ] as such it can have a 2-d cesaro limit , although the value of this limit is not directly clear .",
    "but then further note that since @xmath580 and @xmath584 should have the same limit , by symmetry , yet @xmath585 , so this limit must in fact be @xmath45 .",

    "that such computations imply the riemann hypothesis is false , we now conclude by trying to clarify which claims are in fact rigorously supported and where there are gaps requiring more detailed justification .    * ( 1 ) * the first major issue requiring more rigorous justification is that , in the case of @xmath3 , we have simply asserted that because @xmath3 satisfies the generalised root identity for @xmath17 for all @xmath24 ( modulo the @xmath28 obstruction factor ) , so it must ( like @xmath2 ) continue to satisfy these identities for all @xmath24 for @xmath741 . in part",
    "this reflects the belief that , having verified the @xmath17 identity , so that roughly @xmath742 for arbitrary @xmath24 ( the more rigorous statement including the renormalisation correction and @xmath28 term is ( [ eq : hadamardzeta ] ) ) , so further differentiation by @xmath743should imply that the generalised root identities hold for @xmath3 also at arbitrary @xmath0 , and in particular @xmath741 .",
    "but as well as being heuristic this skates over the possibility that there exist functions which act as obstructions for the root identities for @xmath741 in the same way as the functions @xmath450act as obstructions for the root identities for @xmath12 . since @xmath25 does already satisfy the @xmath17 identity for arbitrary @xmath24 ( and hence for @xmath744 ) , so this is the question of whether , for any given @xmath531 , there exists a function , @xmath745 which fails to satisfy the root identities for @xmath287 but satisfies them all at arbitrary @xmath24 for @xmath746 ( since we need to leave these identities undisturbed ) .",
    "we have not addressed this question at all in this paper although , based on considerable experimentation , we believe that the non - existence of such additional obstructions is a reasonable conjecture ( as well as one that seems quite distinct from rh ) .",
    "another way of thinking of this issue is that we know from [ 1 ] ( e.g. the discussion of removable singularities for discrete cesaro schemes discussed in [ 1 ] , section 4.3 ) that the values obtained by cesaro methods at individual parameter values ( e.g. @xmath747 ) are only reliable if they arise from cesaro analysis in an open region around these values which represents a proper analytic continuation ( e.g. in @xmath0 ) to these regions .",
    "since we have only actually verified the root identities @xmath748 for @xmath3 at the isolated values @xmath12 , we have not in fact even established a starting open region in @xmath134 where the root identities are true , let alone systematically extended to regions encompassing the critical points @xmath747 . in a separate paper ( [ 8 ] ) , however , we address this deficiency by showing numerically that it appears that the generalised root identities for @xmath3 are indeed satisfied for all real @xmath749 , where both @xmath750 and @xmath751 are given by classically convergent expressions ; and furthermore that they appear to continue to be satisfied both for values @xmath752 where cesaro divergences need to be removed on the root side and for values @xmath753 where cesaro divergences not only need to be removed but a further cesaro averaging of the resulting residual partial - sum function applied . for @xmath0",
    "further to the left ( i.e. @xmath754 ) the numerical difficulties in verifying the root identities then become too significant without major effort beyond that attempted in [ 8 ] owing to the need to perform additional applications of the cesaro averaging operator @xmath92 , but nonetheless these numerical results in [ 8 ] seem to us to be strongly suggestive that @xmath3 does indeed satisfy the generalised root identities for all @xmath755 ( and hence all @xmath29 by analytic continuation ) as desired .",
    "in addition to this we would also argue that the fact that we have computed the root sides explicitly when @xmath42 and @xmath43 and thereby demonstrated that @xmath3 does satisfy the generalised root identities at these points ( modulo estimate ( [ eq : s2_estimate ] ) in the case of @xmath43 ) is strongly suggestive on its own that @xmath3 should continue to satisfy these identities at @xmath6 , which is the key to result 1 ; and we believe this especially because it seems to us that the nature of the calculation in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 cases is non - obvious and itself suggestive of the aptness of the cesaro approach .    *",
    "( 2 ) * a second major issue is that we have not , in fact , rigorously validated the definition of generalised cesaro convergence along a contour given in definition 1 , i.e. we have not rigorously shown that this definition , and in particular the distinction between removing `` eigenfunctions '' in the geometric variable @xmath125 but then just averaging in arc - length @xmath109 , guarantees correct analytic continuation in the situations in which we have applied it ( e.g. in @xmath7 and @xmath0 on the root - side , @xmath351 , of root identities ) .",
    "the numerous examples in the paper where this is confirmed by calculation ( e.g. the definition of @xmath2 , the root identities for @xmath2 at @xmath1 and for @xmath3 at @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) give strong `` experimental '' evidence that this is so , but no rigorous argument has been given .",
    "briefly , such an argument would likely proceed along the following lines , illustrated here in the context of the simpler case of the root side of the root identities for @xmath21 ( but easily adaptable to the case of @xmath3 ) :    \\(a ) initially restrict to @xmath7 real so that for @xmath756 we are back in the setting of partial sum functions on @xmath8 handled rigorously in [ 1 ] via regular polynomials , @xmath96 , in @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath0 is real and @xmath749 the series defining @xmath756 is classically convergent , and when @xmath757 the `` removable '' cesaro eigenfunctions are all in fact naturally functions ( e.g. @xmath758 etc ) in the geometric variable @xmath172    \\(b ) thus the rigorous methods of [ 1 ] should establish , for all @xmath7 real , the correct analytic continuation of @xmath756 from @xmath749 to all real @xmath0",
    ". analytic extension of @xmath756 to @xmath7 off the real line ( holding @xmath0 real still initially ) is then uniquely determined and seemingly must involve still `` removing '' the same divergent terms in the variable @xmath52 , which is no longer real but has the same geometric meaning , namely @xmath172 as described in definition 1    \\(c ) finally , analytic continuation to all @xmath0 off the real line is then also uniquely determined ( although it is no longer necessarily still interpretable in terms of cesaro convergence if @xmath7 is not real ; note that in this paper we have never actually considered non - real @xmath0 ) .    with respect to ( b ) , note that the fact that we remove `` eigenfunctions '' such as @xmath758 in the geometric variable @xmath52 ( rather than , say , @xmath759 in @xmath760 ) means that as @xmath0 varies and causes @xmath441 to pass through positive integer values @xmath761 we do not instantaneously pick up discontinuous contributions to the cesaro limits at these @xmath0-values ( as we would if we were removing `` eigenfunctions '' in @xmath109 ) .",
    "this observation bears directly on the remarks ( ii ) and ( iii ) made in commenting upon definition 1 in section 2.1 , and is especially relevant for why we hope that we can still trust the cesaro evaluations in this paper for @xmath2 and @xmath3 at non - positive integer values without need for correction of removable singularities .",
    "note finally , in passing , that the adaptation of the above scheme of argument to the case of @xmath3 would involve negligible change for handling the trivial roots , and would merely require an adaptation of the approach in [ 1 ] from functions on @xmath8 to functions on the positive and negative imaginary axes for handling the @xmath342 and @xmath762 components of the non - trivial roots .",
    "* ( 3 ) * for @xmath3 in the cases of @xmath747 we have relied on a claim that we can ascribe a 2d cesaro limit of @xmath45 to @xmath763 .",
    "in fact , along with a parameter ( say @xmath764 ) for the trivial roots , @xmath46 , the calculations for @xmath751 at @xmath741 are all really 3d cesaro calculations , but we can treat the trivial root calculations independently and it is only in relation to the claim that @xmath638 that we are obliged to consider the two variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 simultaneously . the argument for this claim ( in ( [ eq:2dcesarolimit_ln ] ) ) is , however , clearly non - rigorous ( particularly since we have not formalised the 2d notion , on a pair of contours , being used ) . nonetheless",
    ", we make the following two observations about this claim here :    \\(a ) first we reiterate that , as noted in section 4.2.1 , for purposes of our claim re rh this 2d cesaro limit could alternatively be taken as an _ implication _ of the @xmath42 root identity and then applied without caveat to the @xmath43 and @xmath6 cases on that basis , and    \\(b ) secondly , in [ 8 ] , as part of explicitly considering the cesaro treatment of the non - trivial root contributions to @xmath751 in a neighbourhood of @xmath45 , we provide strong numerical evidence to justify taking @xmath765 that @xmath766 as @xmath0 approaches @xmath45 from below .",
    "moreover we give a precise conjecture as to how this @xmath54 divergence may be arising naturally in the limit as @xmath767 ( essentially from the contributions from @xmath342 and @xmath762 each individually diverging as @xmath767 but in opposite directions so that the overall @xmath317-contribution remains finite ) and likewise give strong numerical evidence that this conjecture is true .",
    "this would validate fully that taking @xmath638 at @xmath42 ( and presumably similarly at @xmath43 and @xmath6 ) is the correct thing to do in order to ensure correct analytic continuation .    *",
    "lastly , in order to focus on calculation , in numerous areas throughout the paper we have been somewhat loose , for example in :    \\(a ) adopting a heuristic approach in applying fourier theory to perform calculations on the derivative side in some examples of the generalised root identities , and indeed even in regards to the fourier definition of @xmath32 on the derivative side of these identities in the first place ,    \\(b ) interpreting integrals , @xmath768 or @xmath769 , in a cesaro way as required ( effectively applying a universal cesaro viewpoint throughout the paper ) ,    \\(c ) utilising taylor series expansions without always being careful regarding their domains of convergence , and    \\(d ) using formal cesaro methods to obtain the required parts of the asymptotic expansions of @xmath770 and @xmath771 in the calculations of the root sides of the root identities for @xmath3 at @xmath747 .    for instance , in analysing @xmath770 and @xmath771 as mentioned in ( d ) , despite the fact that these are all classically well - defined functions and thus should be calculable without recourse to cesaro methods , we instead began by applying a taylor series expansion    @xmath772 inside an integral , @xmath773 ( namely the integral term in the definition of @xmath397 ) , where for any fixed @xmath46 this expansion is not classically valid for most of the domain of integration @xmath774 .",
    "we nonetheless proceeded by working formally term by term in descending powers of @xmath46 , using cesaro methods ( specifically lemma 6 ) to evaluate the resulting divergent integrals in @xmath775 which then form the coefficients .",
    "and , for @xmath397 , we thereby ended up with result ( [ eq : zetarootside_mu-1_ntq ] ) , which can readily be extended by keeping the next lower order terms in @xmath46 to give a more detailed expansion such as    @xmath776    and similar results for @xmath640 and @xmath652 .    notwithstanding this `` looseness , '' however ,",
    "we believe that all the calculational claims in this paper are solid . in particular , in relation to the listed areas ( a ) - ( d ) and how they bear on our calculations for @xmath3 , note that :    \\(i ) on the derivative side of the root identities for @xmath3 at arbitrary @xmath0",
    "we have only ever relied on property ( [ eq : muderiva ] ) of @xmath40 and not needed to explicitly invoke fourier and distributional arguments as @xmath777 and hence also as @xmath778 via the functional equation ; to handle the @xmath2-style asymptotic behaviour that thereby arises as @xmath778 we adapt our arguments regarding stirling s theorem in section 3.4 to this `` one - sided '' setting ( i.e. stirling asymptotics only as @xmath778 not in both directions ) .",
    "details are omitted here however . ] , and    \\(ii ) as noted in section 4.2.2 , all the claims regarding @xmath770 and @xmath771 used in calculating the root sides of the root identities for @xmath3 at @xmath747 are in fact true and have been verified both numerically and by alternative rigorous derivation ( see appendix 5.3 ) .",
    "overall , despite the issues ( 1)-(4 ) flagged in this section ( some of which are further addressed in [ 8 ] ) , we believe , both for the variety of reasons mentioned in the discussion in this section and on the basis of the results derived throughout the paper in a range of examples , that the methods and results of this paper are correct .",
    "the final figure below depicts relationships among the concepts and results of this paper , and linkages with other well - known results .",
    "it is included in order to provide a survey of the avenues investigated in the paper , and to illustrate why they may provide a new perspective on certain issues , in particular the way they combine in leading to the claim made in result 1 .",
    "[ [ rigorous - verification - of - formal - cesaro - results - for - deltadelta_1-and - delta_2 ] ] rigorous verification of formal cesaro results for @xmath786 and @xmath771 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in the course of evaluating the root side of the root identities for @xmath3 when @xmath43 and @xmath6 we used the following results regarding @xmath787 and @xmath771 which we derived using formal cesaro means :                          we now show that these results are all in fact valid despite their heuristic derivation in the body of the paper .",
    "we start with a proof of the asymptotic expansion for @xmath397 in result ( [ eq : appendixdelta1 ] ) .",
    "where@xmath801 and @xmath802is the first `` periodic bernoulli function '' as defined in section 1.1 . using the fact that @xmath803 for @xmath804 ( except at the integer points when @xmath75 which is a set of measure @xmath45 ) , we can write the integral ( [ eq : appendixdelta7 ] ) as                                  @xmath830 and differentiating the right hand side with respect to @xmath46 , we see that , for fixed @xmath831 the right hand side is maximised when @xmath832 .",
    "this maximum @xmath833 is a constant multiple of @xmath834 .",
    "hence @xmath835 and since @xmath836 is at most a constant multiple of @xmath833 , so we can apply the dominated convergence theorem and see that @xmath825 as @xmath549 .",
    "thus in ( [ eq : appendixdelta8 ] ) we have that the integral ( [ eq : appendixdelta7 ] ) is given by              where @xmath842 is euler s constant .",
    "but since @xmath843 it follows easily that @xmath844(k+\\alpha)\\rightarrow0 $ ] as @xmath487 .",
    "hence we have that the partial integral @xmath845 does have a generalised cesaro limit as @xmath487 and in fact we have        this leaves just the verification of the asymptotic expressions ( [ eq : appendixdelta2 ] ) and ( [ eq : appendixdelta3 ] ) for @xmath847 and @xmath771 .",
    "fully rigorous derivations of these have also been obtained along the lines of the derivation above for @xmath397 , after obtaining recurrence relations and certain preliminary estimates for the integrals    @xmath848 for the sake of brevity , however , we omit details here . instead , as an alternative we note that the expressions in ( [ eq : appendixdelta1])-([eq : appendixdelta3 ] ) for @xmath849 and @xmath771 can also all be readily verified numerically by writing the integral in the definition of @xmath397 as a convergent sum over @xmath180 of integrals from @xmath180 to @xmath850 ; since on each such unit interval the integral is easy to perform exactly ( and likewise for the furrther integrations for @xmath847 and @xmath771 ) , so the resulting expressions for @xmath849 and @xmath771 are comprised entirely of elementary functions and convergent sums of the same , allowing thorough numerical verification of the claimed asymptotic expansions .",
    "such sample numerical confirmations , implemented via vba code , can be found in the xl2007 spreadsheet `` delta_0_1_2_asymptoticsfinal2.xlsm '' made available with this paper .          in these cases the specific claims required ( that @xmath852 , @xmath853 , @xmath854 , and @xmath855 ) all involve only @xmath856 or @xmath857 and are readily checked independently by direct calculation . however , since we regard lemma 6 as an independently interesting result in the cesaro framework , we include its general proof here now .                  on the one hand , if @xmath863 for all @xmath118 then @xmath864 on recognising the binomial expansion of @xmath865 . on the other , if @xmath866 for all @xmath118 then @xmath867 on using the fact that only the @xmath868 term is non - zero and invoking ( [ eq : fg_n0_r ] ) .",
