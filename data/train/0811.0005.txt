    "the @xmath0 ophiuchi cloud complex has been a target of intense studies in the past decade due to some unique features .",
    "first , it is one of the closest star - forming regions with a distance estimated to be about 130 pc ( see section 2 ) and it is available to observers in both the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "this proximity makes even the low luminosity substellar objects in the region accessible to spectroscopy as well as imaging .",
    "its large centrally condensed core , with gas column densities corresponding to a@xmath1 = 50 - 100 mag , provides an effective screen against background stars and is an intermediate example of star - formation relative to the low mass stars and isolated dense cores in taurus - auriga clouds and rich stellar clusters and massive cores in the orion molecular cloud .",

    "the large red reflection nebula in the south is illuminated by the m supergiant @xmath2 sco.,width=480 ]    the basic structure of the cloud complex and its surroundings can be seen in the color image shown in fig .",
    "b stars in the sco - cen association , as well as the m supergiant @xmath2 sco , illuminate the dust bordering the dark dust clouds .",
    "the b2v star hd  147889 lies on the western edge of the centrally condensed core and the main cloud l1688 .",
    "dark streamers trail to the northeast ( l1709 ) and the southeast ( l1689 ) .",
    "the detailed extinction due to dust derived from star counts has been presented by @xcite and @xcite and the corresponding column density of molecular gas can be seen in the @xmath3co integrated intensity maps obtained for the _ complete survey of star - forming regions _ ( see fig .",

    "the major clouds are labeled with their lynds designations as are four b stars from the upper scorpius subgroup of the sco - cen ob association.,width=547 ]    since the last review of this cloud prepared in 1991 @xcite , there has been a wealth of new instruments and data available on the ophiuchus region . at high energies , the rosat , chandra , and xmm - newton x - ray telescopes have surveyed this region , displaying a high sensitivity to young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "large aperture ground - based telescopes have opened the possibility for spectroscopic studies of very low mass and substellar objects .",
    "ground - based near - infrared camera surveys by various groups and 2mass have given us for the first time a complete sample of sources over a large area .",
    "with the repair of the nicmos camera on the hubble space telescope , deep near - infrared imaging from space has been possible .",
    "the space - based infrared telescopes , the infrared space observatory and the spitzer space telescope , have surveyed the cloud , sensitive to warm dust surrounding ysos . and finally array receivers on millimeter - wave telescopes have made large scale surveys of dense gas and dust possible .    in this chapter",
    "the main focus is a review of these new data sets and the basic results that have advanced our knowledge of this star - forming region since 1991 through 2007 .",
    "the review concentrates on the main cloud , l1688 . in section 2",
    ", we review the relationship of l1688 to the sco - cen ob association and distance estimates to the @xmath0 oph cloud .",
    "recent molecular - line and millimeter continuum observations that have revealed the clumpy structure of the cloud are discussed in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we review observations covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum that have enabled the identification of many new ysos in the cloud .",
    "we present a table of over 300 ysos associated with the cloud , along with their positions and infrared magnitudes from the 2mass survey .",
    "in addition , we present a table of the most heavily obscured ysos , some too faint to be detected at near - infrared wavelengths , and a table of candidate young brown dwarfs . in section 5 ,",
    "we briefly discuss outflow activity in the cloud . finally , we review star formation in the lower density streamers of the @xmath0 oph cloud complex in section 6 .",
    "the idea that star formation in the l1688 cloud was triggered by compression from the sco - cen ob association has a long history @xcite .",
    "both cloud morphology and cloud chemistry has been cited as evidence . @xcite has identified hi loops surrounding the sco - cen subgroups .",
    "he proposes that a slow shock has been produced by an interaction between the expanding shell from the upper scorpius subgroup and ambient gas from the l1688 cloud .",
    "the formation of this shell requires a supernova event 1 to 1.5 myr ago ; the runaway star @xmath4 oph is proposed to be the binary companion to the supernova @xcite .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the compression of the l1688 core and median age of 0.3 myr for ysos in the core @xcite .",
    "further evidence for the triggering by upper scorpius comes from the alignment of class i protostars perpendicular to the proposed direction of shock propagation @xcite .",
    "however , spectroscopic studies of ysos from a broader region ( @xmath51 deg@xmath6 ) surrounding the l1688 cloud suggests a population of ysos that predates the arrival of this slow shock .",
    "spectroscopic studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have characterized a population of @xmath5100 ysos that lie at the periphery of the l1688 cloud with a median age of 2 myr .",
    "wilking et al .",
    "point out that an h - r diagram of these objects is indistinguishable from that of low mass stars in the upper scorpius subgroup presented by @xcite ( 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it is proposed that the formation of this surface population of stars surrounding the l1688 core was contemporaneous with low mass stars in the upper scorpius subgroup in a once larger l1688 cloud .",
    "the age for this earlier episode of star formation ranges from 2 - 5 myr ago , depending on the correction for unresolved binaries .",
    "the trigger for this event , and the formation of the upper scorpius subgroup , was presumably the passage of an expanding shell from the upper centaurus - lupus ob subgroup .",
    "this sequence of events is consistent with the similar velocities derived for young stars associated with @xmath0 oph and upper sco @xcite .",
    "the distance to the @xmath0 ophiuchi molecular complex has undergone some revision in the past decade from the canonical value of 160 pc @xcite .",
    "the change has been due in large part to the hipparcos space astrometry mission and accurate parallax values for stars in the upper scorpius subgroup . yet due to the high visual extinction from the cloud , there are few bright stars known to be associated with the cloud with well - determined parallaxes .",
    "based on ground - based photometry , @xcite derived extinctions and absolute magnitudes for stars in the upper scorpius subgroup . from a plot of the extinction vs. distance modulus , they defined the front edge of the cloud at 80 pc and the far edge at 170 pc .",
    "this yielded an estimate of 125 @xmath7 25 pc for the cloud center .",
    "@xcite used hipparcos proper motions and parallaxes to define a group of 120 association members in the upper scorpius subgroup over an area of 20x 20 . the mean distance derived for",
    "this group was 145 @xmath7 2 pc .",
    "@xcite has noted that there are gaps in the hi emission that forms an expanding shell originating from the upper scorpius subgroup and that these gaps correspond to co emission from the @xmath0 oph cloud .",
    "he proposed that the molecular cloud sits in front of the hi shell .",
    "this would imply a distance to the cloud closer than the mean distance to upper scorpius .",
    "using the hipparcos catalog trigonometric parallaxes , @xcite compiled color excesses and distances derived from the parallaxes for o - m stars within 6 degrees of the cloud .",
    "they found an extinction jump at 120 pc and suggested an upper limit of 150 pc to the cloud .",
    "@xcite has estimated a distance of 131@xmath73 pc from a sample of seven association members within 5  of l1688 .",
    "@xcite used astrometric proper motions for 58 probable association members over the same region to derive a distance of 145 pc using the convergent point method .",
    "guided by an extinction map derived from 2mass , @xcite used hipparcos and tycho parallaxes combined with a maximum likelihood analysis to obtain a distance of 119 @xmath7 6 pc .",
    "these estimates include the star hd  147889 ( 136@xmath726 pc ) which appears to sit just behind the western edge of the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite have used vlbi astrometry of two association members with strong radio emission to derive a distance of 120.0 pc ( + 4.5 pc , @xmath84.2 pc ) for the northern l1688 core , however , the same technique yields greater distances for sources in the eastern core . clearly , the l1688 cloud exists over a range of distances , most likely between 120 pc and 145 pc . for this review ,",
    "we adopt a distance of 130 pc to l1688 .",

    "far - infrared images by iso confirm that the heating of dust is dominated by b stars in the cloud ( sr  3 and oph source 1 ) and by the b2v star hd  147889 which lies at the western edge of the cloud @xcite .",

    "this mass spectrum resembles the stellar initial mass function and it is suggested that if each of the cores collapsed into individual stars , they could produce an initial mass function .",
    "the observed mass spectrum implies that turbulent fragmentation at the prestellar stage plays a dominant role in its production ( see * ? ? ?",

    "although ysos emit less than 1% of their bolometric luminosity in the 0.1 - 10 kev soft x - ray band , x - ray surveys are a good way to identify cloud members because the x - ray to bolometric luminosity ratio of ysos is much higher than most foreground and background field stars .",
