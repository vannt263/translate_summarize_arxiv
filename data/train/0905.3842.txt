    "transport properties in one - dimensional interacting systems such as quantum wires or metallic carbon nanotubes have been widely studied both theoretically and experimentally . when the wire or nanotube is well connected to a metallic contact , and another tunnel contact",
    "is placed on top of it , the current exhibits a zero bias anomaly @xcite because of the coulomb interaction effects in this one dimensional system . on the contrary an isolated wire with bad contacts displays coulomb blockade effects @xcite .",
    "another interesting tool to characterize the transport is the noise ( current - current fluctuations ) .",
    "it allows for instance to obtain information about the charge of the carriers flowing through the conductor .",
    "when electrons are injected in an _ infinite length _ carbon nanotube from a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip , it has been shown@xcite that the fano factor  the ratio between the zero - frequency noise and the current  is equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coulomb interaction strength .",
    "this fano factor is tied to the charge of the collective excitations which are present within the wire . however , the presence of adiabatic fermi liquid contacts at the extremities of the nanotube modifies@xcite the fano factor and effectively erases the information about the coulomb interactions .    to recover information about coulomb interactions ,",
    "finite - frequency noise is needed .",
    "recent experiments@xcite have shown that the current - current correlator which can be detected is in general related to the non - symmetrized noise rather than the symmetrized one .",
    "calculations of the finite - frequency non - symmetrized noise in the stm+nanotube system showed oscillations due to reflections at the contacts@xcite whose period is related to the anomalous charges .    in the above calculations , electrostatic effects such as screening between the wire and tip",
    "were typically left out .",
    "screening from the stm tip is likely to affect locally the electronic properties of the wire .",
    "such effects were explicitly computed in ref .  , where emphasis was put on the spectral properties of the wire .",
    "there , we developed general expressions for the dyson equations , which allowed to derive non perturbatively the greens functions of the bosonic fields which are needed to obtain the spectral function of the wire .",
    "the tunneling density of states was shown to be enhanced ( reduced ) for large ( weak ) coulomb interaction @xcite .    while the spectral function , the tunneling and the local density of states are quantities of great interest in condensed matter physics problems , they are typically measured in the context of electron transport , by tunneling experiments . in ref .",
    "for instance , the tunneling current between two luttinger liquids is typically expressed as a convolution of the two tunneling density of states of such materials .    in the present paper , we wish for the first time to address transport and screening effects on the same footing .",
    "we argue that because the interaction between the tip and wire mixes the fermionic degrees of freedom of both source and drain , the derivation of the tunneling current and noise has to be revisited .",
    "as we shall see , the tunneling current depends on a new class of greens function which we call `` mixed '' green s functions .",
    "the use of the bosonization methods allows to compute the tunneling current , as usual , to second order in the tunneling amplitude , albeit `` non perturbatively '' with respect to the coulomb interaction between the wire and tip .",
    "this work thus suggests plainly that in the presence of screening effect , special care must be taken in the derivation of transport properties .",
    "a generalization of our results to carbon nanotubes can be straightforwardly obtained .",

    "<S> we study the effect of an electrostatic coupling between a scanning tunneling microscope tip and a luttinger liquid wire on the tunneling current and noise between the two . solving the dyson equations </S>",
    "<S> non perturbatively for a local interaction potential , we derive the green s functions associated to the wire and to the tip . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the electrostatic coupling leads to the existence of new correlators , which we call mixed green s functions , which are correlators between the bosonic fields of the wire and the tip . </S>",
    "<S> next , we calculate the transport properties up to second order with the amplitude of the tunnel transfer : the tunnel current is strongly reduced by the presence of screening . the zero - frequency noise is modified in a similar way , but the fano factor remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the effect of the screening on the asymmetry of the finite - frequency non - symmetrized noise and on the conductance . </S>"
