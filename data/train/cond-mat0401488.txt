    "since the discovery of the first high temperature superconducting compounds ( htsc),@xcite there has been a huge amount of activity to understand why this occurs . although there is nearly universal agreement that the superconductivity arises from the spin - singlet pairing of holes ( or possibly electrons , in some cases ) , there is no agreement as to the mechanism for this pairing .",
    "it is also agreed by nearly all workers that the most likely place in the htsc for this pairing to take place is in the ubiquitous cuo@xmath1 layers . although many proposed pairing mechanisms varying widely in exoticity ( and correspondingly inversely in likelihood )",
    "have been suggested , it has so far been exceedingly difficult to eliminate many of them , and it has been especially difficult to obtain incontrovertible evidence in support of only a single possible mechanism . in essence , the wide variety of proposed mechanisms falls into two classes : those in which the pairing interaction is attractive or repulsive in sign .",
    "although there is still no definite method to distinguish these pairing interaction signs , at least it has generally been agreed that important information in this regard can be obtained if there were to be a strong consensus as to the orbital symmetry of the superconducting order parameter ( op ) .",
    "since the superconducting coherence length @xmath7 is comparable to a few lattice constants at low temperatures @xmath8 , one would further expect the orbital symmetry of the op to reflect the underlying point group symmetry of the cuo@xmath1 planes.@xcite    for the tetragonal point group @xmath9 appropriate for some htsc containing a single cuo@xmath1 layer , the relevant group operations for a spin singlet superconductor are : ( a ) reflections about the planes normal to the layers containing the directions along the cu - o bond directions , ( b ) reflections about the planes normal to the layers containing the diagonals bisecting neighboring cu - o bond directions , and ( c ) rotations by 90@xmath10 about the @xmath0-axis . based upon oddness or evenness about these group operations",
    ", there are four op irreducible representations of @xmath9 , which are denoted @xmath5 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively.@xcite for example , if the pairing interaction were attractive , as in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) model , one would expect the op to most likely have an orbital symmetry invariant under all of the crystal point group operations , the @xmath5-wave op . although this op could be highly anisotropic , and",
    "could even change sign at certain points on the fermi surface , it necessarily has a non - vanishing fermi surface average . on the other hand , pairing mechanisms based upon a repulsive interaction",
    "necessarily lead to a vanishing fermi surface average , and generally lead to an op that is consistent with @xmath11-wave orbital symmetry , which changes sign on opposite sides of the diagonals between the cu - o bond directions and under 90@xmath10 rotations about the @xmath0-axis . for a tetragonal crystal ,",
    "the op must have only one of the four symmetries , except below a second phase transition at @xmath14 , for which a mixed op form such as @xmath15 can occur .",
    "in orthorhombic yba@xmath1cu@xmath1o@xmath16 , the @xmath17 axis parallel to the cuo chain direction is longer than the @xmath18 axis normal to it , and hence group operations ( b ) and ( c ) no longer apply . in this case",
    ", the point group is the orthorhombic @xmath19 , for which the only effective group operation is ( a ) , reflections in the mirror planes normal to the layers and containing either of the cu - o bond directions.@xcite in this case , @xmath5- and @xmath11-wave op s can mix without a second phase transition , as can the @xmath12- and @xmath13-wave op s , although the relative weight of each component might depend upon @xmath8 .",
    "although , bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath2 ( bi2212 ) is also orthorhombic , the @xmath17 axis containing the orthorhombic distortion and the periodic lattice distortion is along a diagonal bisecting neighboring cu - o bond directions , leading to an effective point group @xmath20 , with only the group operation ( b ) remaining.@xcite in this case , the relative mixed op forms in the absence of a second phase transition are either mixtures of @xmath5- and @xmath12-wave op s , or mixtures of @xmath11- and @xmath13-wave op s .",
    "hence , to the extent that the crystal is perfect , a mixture of @xmath5- and @xmath11-wave op s could only occur as a @xmath15 op below a second phase transition at @xmath14 .    for the last decade , there has therefore been a raging debate with regards to this @xmath5-wave/@xmath21-wave controversy.@xcite however , as the htsc exhibit a non - superconducting pseudogap in addition to this op,@xcite many experiments can not distinguish them very well , complicating the analysis .",
    "in particular , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and point contact tunneling experiments primarily measure the quasiparticle density of states , and can infer an overall gap in its spectrum , but can not infer any information about the phase of the op .",
    "although such experiments can infer that both the pseudogap and the superconducting gap arising from the non - vanishing op below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath22 can be highly anisotropic , they can not distinguish if the combined superconducting gap and pseudogap actually vanishes at some positions in the first brillouin zone , or is just less than the experimental resolution there , and they certainly can not provide any information as to whether it might change sign there .",
    "however , phase - sensitive experiments based upon josephson junctions are not affected by the pseudogap , and can distinguish a @xmath11-wave op from a highly anisotropic @xmath5-wave op form , such as an `` extended-@xmath5''-wave op . recently , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) with atomic resolution have examined surfaces of bi2212 cleaved at low @xmath8 , and determined that a disordered array of pseudogap and superconducting regions of characteristic size @xmath23 3 nm is stable for long times.@xcite if true , this would suggest that there might not be any preferred underlying symmetry relevant for the op , so that a mixture of all four op forms would be possible below @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , this observation would lend strong support to the notion that the @xmath0-axis tunneling across the intrinsic layers in bi2212 ought to be strongly incoherent .",
    "@xmath0-axis bicrystal twist junctions @xcite and more recently artificial cross - whisker junctions ( cwj s ) @xcite have attracted considerable attention because of the possibility of providing phase - sensitive tests of the orbital symmetry of the order parameter ( op ) in ( bi2212).@xcite with incoherent @xmath0-axis quasiparticle tunneling , the @xmath0-axis critical current density @xmath24 across a junction twisted an angle @xmath25 is a constant for @xmath5-wave or @xmath26 for @xmath21-wave op s , respectively.@xcite for coherent tunneling , an anisotropic fermi surface causes both op forms to exhibit a strong , four - fold dependence of @xmath27 , but a @xmath21-wave op leads for weak , first - order tunneling to @xmath28 , whereas @xmath29 for an @xmath5-wave op .",

    "<S> we studied the @xmath0-axis transport of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bi2212 ) cross - whisker junctions formed by annealing `` naturally '' formed whisker crosses . these frequently appear during growth when the @xmath3-faces of neighboring whiskers come in contact . </S>",

    "<S> the interface critical current density is about 3% of the critical current density across the stack of bulk intrinsic junctions , as is the room temperature conductivity , and both are independent of the twist angle , in contrast to most of the data reported on `` artificial '' cross - whisker junctions [ y. takano _ et al . </S>",
