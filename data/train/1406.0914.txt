    "transition metal compounds possess diverse properties , largely due to their electronic correlation effects and the interplay of charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom . for many of them",
    ", spin state is an important issue .",
    "it can be a high - spin ( hs ) , low - spin ( ls ) , or even an intermediate - spin ( is ) state .",
    "the corresponding electronic configurations , e.g. , for a fe@xmath3 ion in an octahedral crystal field , are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the spin state is intimately related to materials properties such as magnetic transitions , metal - insulator transition , and transport behavior . in the past decades",
    ", a lot of research has been carried out on the spin state of 3__d _ _ transition - metal compounds  @xcite .",
    "a consensus has been reached that the spin state issue arises mainly from a competition between the hund s rule coupling and crystal - field splitting .",
    "the former favors a hs state , and the later a ls state .",
    "compared to the well studied spin state issue of 3__d _ _ transition metals , little research has been done on the spin state of 4__d__/5__d _ _ transition - metal compounds@xcite , which is probably due to a fact that in most cases , 4@xmath10/@xmath1 transition metals are in a ls state . as 4__d__/5__d _ _ orbitals are spatially more extended than 3__d _ _ ones , their stronger interaction with the anionic ligands and a larger crystal - field splitting but a moderate or weak hund exchange normally stabilize the ls state@xcite .",
    "kagf@xmath5 . ]    in this work , we have studied the double perovskite cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 using first - principles calculations , focusing on its exotic spin state .",
    "1 shows its cubic structure , in which k@xmath11 and ag@xmath3 ions form an ordered arrangement on the @xmath12-sites of the perovskite @xmath13f@xmath14  @xcite , and the ag - f bond distance is 2.13    ( see also the structural parameters in table i ) .",
    "although a ag@xmath3 ion ( @xmath15 ) could in principle be either in a ls state ( @xmath2=0 , @xmath16 ) or in a hs state ( @xmath2=1 , @xmath17 ) , in reality almost in all known cases the ag@xmath3 ion is in the ls state and is thus nonmagnetic@xcite .",
    "actually , very few ag@xmath3 and cu@xmath3 ( both with @xmath18 electronic configuration ) crystalline compounds are known .",
    "these compounds mostly have a tetragonal or lower symmetry structure to maintain the ls @xmath2=0 ground state@xcite .",
    "similar to the well - known jahn - teller ( jt ) ions like cu@xmath19 and ag@xmath19 , the cu@xmath3 and ag@xmath3 ions could have an even stronger tendency to jt - driven distortions ( local elongation of ligand octahedra ) .",
    "such distortions are usually so strong that the corresponding energy gain exceeds the intraatomic hund s exchange energy , thus stabilizing the ls state .",
    "indeed , the energy of the state with the tetragonal distortion @xmath20 can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the jt coupling constant determining the splitting of the originally degenerate @xmath23 levels with the distortion , and @xmath24 is the number of electrons or holes on the @xmath23 levels ( in our case @xmath24 = 2 , in contrast to @xmath24 = 1 ( one hole ) in the more familiar ion cu@xmath19 ( @xmath25 ) ) . the second term on the right of the above equation corresponds to lattice elastic energy . minimizing this equation with respect to the distortion @xmath20",
    ", we get the equilibrium distortion @xmath26 so that the energy minimum is @xmath27 thus we see that the decrease of the energy for the ions like cu@xmath3 and ag@xmath3 with @xmath24 = 2 is _ four times as large as _ in the already strong jt ions like cu@xmath19 . in effect",
    "this energy almost always exceeds the on - site hund s exchange energy @xmath28 , and such ions have a very strong tendency to such distortion and to the nonmagnetic ls state .",
    "although cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 was not much studied , the available magnetic susceptibility and crystal structure data both suggest a hs state for the ag@xmath3 ion@xcite .",
    "it is indeed very surprising that cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 has magnetic ag@xmath3 ions and these ions sit in the undistorted f@xmath29 octahedra .",
    "why is this the case , which physical mechanisms determine this and what is so specific for this particular material , require explanation .",
    "better understanding of this could open possibilities to stabilize strange states like @xmath30magnetic silver@xmath30 or @xmath30magnetic gold@xmath30 in some other situations .",
    "clarification of the physics leading to such unusual situation is the main goal of the present investigation .",
    "our first - principles calculations indeed show that the undistorted magnetic hs state of ag@xmath3 in cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 is the lowest energy state , and the more conventional jt - distorted ls state lies much higher in energy .",
    "the detailed analysis of our results demonstrates that the compact perovskite structure of cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 could allow only a moderate tetragonal distortion for the ls state , due to a large elastic energy cost associated with the @xmath30hard lattice@xmath30 .",
    "then the moderate @xmath23 crystal - field energy gain is not sufficient to compensate for the elastic energy cost and the hund s exchange loss . as a result",
    ", the ls state can not be stabilized as a ground state .",
    "therefore , cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 is in the hs ground state and represents a rare case of the magnetic ag@xmath3 ion .",
    ".the lattice parameters of cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 in the experimental cubic structure@xcite , and in the optimized tetragonal and ac - tetragonal phases . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     kagf@xmath5 by lsda . ]",
    "to see first the nature of ag - f interaction , a spin - polarized lsda calculation is performed for the cubic structure of cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 in a ferromagnetic state .",
    "we also calculated an antiferromagnetic state and find that the exchange between two nearest - neighboring ag ions is weakly antiferromagnetic , being only about 1 mev .",
    "the electronic structures of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states are practically the same . considering a magnetic frustration associated with the fcc sublattice of the ag ions , a paramagnetic state , or a spin glassy one below very low temperature ( few k ) can be expected for cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 .",
    "our lsda calculations show that it is an insulator with a band gap of 0.5 ev given by the @xmath23 exchange splitting , see fig .",
    "besides the common @xmath31-@xmath23 crystal - field splitting , there is a large bonding - antibonding splitting due to the strong ag @xmath0-f @xmath32 covalency , being about 5 and 3 ev for the @xmath23 and @xmath31 orbital , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath23 bonding state is even lower than the @xmath31 one@xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 bands are fully occupied and the @xmath23 bands are 3/4 occupied , with the fully occupied up - spin @xmath31 and @xmath23 channels . this demonstrates the existence of a hs state and a @xmath33 configuration for the formal ag@xmath3 ( @xmath18 ) ion .",
    "the one hole spreads over the six f atoms in the agf@xmath29 unit , which accounts for a reduced spin moment of 0.90 @xmath34 on the ag site and a finite spin moment of 0.16 @xmath34 on each f. summing up of all these moments and a small fraction in the interstitial region gives a total integer spin moment of 2 @xmath34/fu , confirming the formal hs @xmath2=1 state for the ag@xmath3 ion . as these magnetic agf@xmath29 units are separated in this double perovskite by the corner - shared kf@xmath29 units , they form narrow bands ( sharp dos curves ) and are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "late @xmath0 transition - metal oxides or fluorides often have a moderate electron correlation .",
    "as cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 is a narrow band system , it is natural to study its electron correlation effect . in the following",
    ", we carried out lsda+@xmath35 calculations to study the electron structure of cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 and its spin state . by a comparison of figs . 3 and 2",
    ", we see that with inclusion of the hubbard s interaction _ u _ the ag @xmath0 states undergo some changes , and the biggest effect is that the band gap is increased from 0.5 ev by lsda to 1.1 ev by lsda+@xmath35 .",
    "the hs @xmath2=1 state remains , and the strong ag - f covalency is reflected again by the occupied bonding state of the otherwise empty down - spin @xmath23 orbital .",
    "it is the covalent electron occupation of 0.48@xmath36@xmath372 ( see table ii ) that accounts for the actual configuration @xmath33 of the formal ag@xmath3 ion which is a negative charge transfer cation@xcite .",
    "the above hs magnetic state of the formal ag@xmath3 ion seems to be a straightforward result , but it is actually quite unusual as @xmath0 transition metals are normally in a ls state and the ag@xmath3 is indeed in the ls state for almost all known cases@xcite .",
    "we are thus motivated to check whether there exists another stable structural phase for cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 in which the normal ls state could become a ground state . for this purpose ,",
    "we have also studied a tetragonal structure and carried out a structural optimization .",
    "a tetragonal distortion would yield an @xmath23 crystal - field splitting , and if the splitting is big enough , the ls state could become the ground state .",
    "kagf@xmath5 by lsda+u . ]    to explore the possibility of the ls ground state , we lower the lattice symmetry to allow a local tetragonal distortion of the agf@xmath29 octahedra .",
    "we first use the above cubic lattice constants but optimize the internal atomic positions under a tetragonal symmetry , by minimizing the atomic forces@xcite till each one being smaller than 25 mev /  . after a full electronic and atomic relaxation associated with the initialized ls setup @xmath38(@xmath39)@xmath40(@xmath41)@xmath42 for the formal ag@xmath3 ion , the ls solution is indeed achieved .",
    "it is a local minimum of the energy and has an elongated apical ag - f bondlength of 2.25    and a shrinking planar ag - f bondlength of 1.96    ( see table i for the tetragonal phase ) .",
    "thus , the ls solution is stabilized by the tetragonal distortion ( 0.29  , 2.25/1.96 = 1.15 ) . moreover , in this tetragonally distorted structure , the corresponding hs solution turns out to be less stable than the ls state by 441366 = 75 mev / fu , see table ii .",
    "however , the tetragonal ls phase is 366 mev / fu higher in energy than the above cubic hs one .",
    "we further calculated a regular tetragonal structure with @xmath43 [ i.e. , @xmath44 = 1.15 , see table i for the ac - tetragonal structure which preserves the volume of the experimental cubic cell and the above tetragonal distortion .",
    "this ac - tetragonal ls phase turns out to be still higher in energy than the cubic hs phase by 336 mev / fu .",
    "now we carry out a volume optimization for both the cubic hs state and the ac - tetragonal ls state .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the equilibrium volume of the cubic hs state is about 11% smaller than the experimental one ( i.e. , within 4% underestimation of the lattice constant , within a few percent error bar of density - functional calculations ) .",
    "the equilibrium volume of the ac - tetragonal ls state is also 5% smaller than the experimental one .",
    "note that the energy difference between the two equilibrium states , the cubic hs and the ac - tetragonal ls states , increases up to 750 mev / fu .",
    "this indicates that the cubic hs ground state is robust against the structural optimization .",
    "the metastable ls state is stabilized by the tetragonal distortion , which could be realized in a biaxial pressure experiment .",
    "the present bistable hs and ls solutions can also be understood by a pseudo jahn - teller mechanism for an @xmath45 system@xcite .",
    "kagf@xmath5 by lsda+u . ]    before analyzing the reason why the cubic hs phase is the ground state , we now have a close look at the tetragonal phase either in the ls or hs state . in the tetragonal ls state , the degeneracies of both _",

    "the threefold degenerate _",
    "t@xmath46 _ states are split into doubly degenerate ( _ d@xmath47_/_d@xmath48 _ ) states and singlet _ d@xmath49 _ state .",
    "similarly , the twofold degenerate _",
    "e@xmath6 _ states split into nondegenerate _",
    "d@xmath50 _ and _ d@xmath51 _ states .",
    "it is also an insulator with a small band gap of 0.1 ev , which lies between the occupied _ _",

    "orbital and the unoccupied _ _ pd__@xmath52 antibonding band of the _ d@xmath50 _",
    "the equal occupation of the spin - up and spin - down orbitals results in a nonmagnetic state without any exchange splitting , in accordance with the ls @xmath2=0 character .",
    "note that the strong hybridization between ag 4__d _ _ and planar - f / apical - f 2__p _ _ orbitals is similar to that in cubic phase ( see table ii ) , by which the ag 4__d _ _ orbitals split into a series of narrow bonding and antibonding orbitals .",
    "such electronic structure , with narrow - band and large bonding - antibonding splitting , is governed by the behavior of the isolated agf@xmath5 clusters .",
    "generally speaking , the bonding - antibonding splitting of both _",
    "e@xmath6 _ orbitals is larger than that of _ t@xmath46 _ orbitals due to larger overlap between _ e@xmath6 _ and _ p _ orbitals .",
    "furthermore , the bonding - antibonding splitting of _ d@xmath50 _",
    "orbital in the tetragonal phase is larger than that of _ d@xmath51 _ due to the shrinking planar ag - f bond length .",
    "the _ t@xmath46 _ and _ d@xmath53 _ bands are fully occupied and the _ d@xmath50 _ band is half occupied .",
    "hence , the 4__d _ _ occupation of 9@xmath36 is one more electron than the nominal value for ag@xmath3 .",
    "this suggests the strong covalent nature of the ag - f bonds , in contrast to the naive ionic picture .",
    "kagf@xmath5 by lsda+u . ]    for the spin - polarized hs state of the tetragonal phase ( fig .",
    "6 ) , the band splitting and ag - f hybridization are similar to those in the ls state , but the occupation of _ e@xmath6 _ orbitals has a remarkable change . while the up - spin _ d@xmath50 _ and _ d@xmath51 _ states are fully occupied , their down - spin counterparts are half occupied .",
    "the unequal occupation of the up - spin ( 5@xmath36 ) and down - spin ( 4@xmath36 ) states results in a considerable exchange splitting , reflecting a hs state character .",
    "although the double degeneracy of _ e@xmath6 _ orbitals is lifted by the tetragonal distortion , the electron configuration of ( _ d@xmath50_)@xmath54 and ( _ d@xmath53_)@xmath54 for down - spin is the same as that in cubic phase with @xmath23 degeneracy , indicating again the significant ag - f covalency .",
    "a tiny band gap lies between the occupied _ _",
    "pd__@xmath52 antibonding band of the _ d@xmath55 _ orbital and the unoccupied _ _ pd__@xmath52 antibonding band of the _",
    "_ orbital .",
    "here we clarify the reason why the cubic hs phase is the lowest energy state , using the above total - energy results ( see table ii ) .",
    "the 441 mev / fu increase of energy from the cubic hs phase to the tetragonal hs phase is attributed to the lattice elastic energy cost ( _ e@xmath56 _ ) associated with the tetragonal distortion , as the electronic configuration remains unchanged in both hs states and no crystal - field energy is involved .",
    "the energy difference of 75 mev / fu between the tetragonal hs and tetragonal ls ( both in the same lattice ) is due to the competition between the hund exchange ( @xmath28 ) and the crystal - field level splitting ( @xmath57 ) of the @xmath23 electrons , with @xmath57 and @xmath28 being both about 1 ev and @xmath57 slightly larger than @xmath28 . whether the cubic hs phase or the tetragonal ls one is the ground state depends on three competing contributions : @xmath58__e _ _ = _ e_(tetragonal ls ) ",
    "_ e_(cubic hs ) = _ e@xmath56 _ + _ j@xmath59 _  _ e@xmath60_. taking _ j@xmath59 _  _ e@xmath60 _ = 75 mev / fu from above , the tetragonal ls phase could become the ground state ( @xmath58__e _ _ @xmath61 0 ) only when the _",
    "e@xmath56 _ is lower than 75 mev / fu .",
    "however , here _",
    "e@xmath56 _ is up to 441 mev / fu .",
    "therefore , the cubic hs phase is the ground state , and the large elastic energy cost in this compact double perovskite structure prevents the tetragonal distortion from yielding a large @xmath57 to stabilize the ls state .    as seen in figs . 5 and 6 , in the tetragonal phase",
    ", the _ e@xmath6 _ crystal - field splitting and the exchange splitting are quite close in size .",
    "this explains the small band gap present in both the ls and hs solutions .",
    "this also accords with the small energy difference of 75 mev / fu between the tetragonal hs and ls phases .",
    "as discussed above , three competing contributions get involved in determination of the ground spin - state solution : @xmath58__e _ _ = _ e_(tetragonal ls ) ",
    "_ e_(cubic hs ) = _ e@xmath56 _ + _ j@xmath59 _  _ e@xmath60_. among them , the lattice elastic energy cost @xmath62 and the _ e@xmath6 _ crystal - field splitting @xmath57 are most influenced by the structural details , but the hund exchange @xmath63 is almost a constant , being about 1 ev .",
    "therefore , only a large @xmath57 but a small @xmath62 would favor a tetragonal ls ground state .",
    "we thus conceive that such a situation could be met in an open structure , which can maintain a large jahn - teller distortion ( and thus a large @xmath57 ) but with a low @xmath62 cost .",
    "for example , in the well - known la@xmath4cuo@xmath64 , there is a huge distortion ( 0.5  ) of the cu - o bonds , being 1.90  @xmath37 4 in plane and 2.40  @xmath37 2 out of plane@xcite .",
    "this is due to a lattice strain effect in this layered material@xcite and to the cu - o bondlength adjustment for the @xmath41 type hole - orbital order driven by an anisotropic crystal field@xcite . upon a hole doping , the holes spread over the in - plane ligand oxygens and they hybridize with the central cu@xmath19 @xmath2=1/2 to form a zhang - rice singlet@xcite ( the _ d@xmath65 _ configuration with _ s _ = 0 or a nominal ls cu@xmath3 with two holes on _ d@xmath50 _ orbital ) .",
    "it is the large @xmath23 crystal - field splitting but a small elastic energy cost which lead to the formation of the ls state upon hole doping . we can expect to have a similar situation in the layered 214 structure with ag instead of cu .",
    "however , in the compact perovskite structure of cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 , the tetragonal distortion can not be as large as in the layered la@xmath66cuo@xmath67 . as a result ,",
    "here the ls state is disfavored , but the magnetic hs state of the ag@xmath3 ion is the ground state .",
    "to summarize , using first - principles calculations , we find that the cubic double perovskite cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 has a strong ag - f covalency , and that the formal ag@xmath3 ion has an unusual high - spin ( hs ) @xmath2 = 1 ground state .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to a common view that ag@xmath3 always prefers a tetragonal or lower - symmetry coordination and a low - spin ( ls ) @xmath2=0 state . in calculations",
    ", we could also get the @xmath30normal@xmath30 ls state , associated with a tetragonal distortion of 0.29  . however , the tetragonal ls state turns out to be energetically less favorable than the cubic hs state .",
    "we propose that three competing contributions tip the balance between the hs and ls states , which is formulated by the expression @xmath68 . as the compact perovskite structure of cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 allows only a moderate tetragonal distortion ( but with a large elastic energy cost @xmath62 ) , a corresponding moderate crystal - field energy gain @xmath57 in the tetragonal ls state can not compensate for the @xmath62 and hund s exchange loss @xmath28 . as a result ,",
    "the cubic hs phase is the ground state .",
    "we thus conclude that cs@xmath4kagf@xmath5 is a rare case of the magnetic ag@xmath3 ion , and suggest that the ag@xmath3 ls nonmagnetic state can readily be formed in open structure materials such as layered systems .",
