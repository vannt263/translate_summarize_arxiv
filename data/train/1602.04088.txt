    "organic crystalline semiconductors are promising materials for a variety of devices , ranging from light emitting diodes @xcite to photovoltaics @xcite , and field - effect transistors @xcite .",
    "the possibility of synthesizing and processing these systems at low temperature and in solution is a particularly attractive feature @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "organic crystals have attracted considerable interest in the last few decades . depending on size and chemical composition of the molecular components as well as on the packing arrangement , it is possible to design systems with optimized properties .",
    "oligothiophenes represent a well - known family of organic crystals , which has been largely studied in view of opto - electronic applications @xcite .",
    "while the shortest thiophene oligomers are not suitable for device applications , due to their large band gap , most interest is devoted to longer chains such as @xmath0-sexithiophene ( 6 t ) .",
    "this material presents , in fact , a favorable combination of relatively high charge - carrier mobility @xcite and visible light absorption @xcite , which makes it a very promising compound for organic electronics .",
    "the weak interactions between 6 t molecules enable the growth of two crystal structures , which are referred to as high- and low - temperature ( ht and lt ) phases @xcite . both exhibit herringbone packing , with either two ( ht ) or four ( lt ) molecules per unit cell .",
    "polymorphism , i.e. , the presence of two or more possible arrangements of the molecules in the solid state @xcite , is often observed in organic crystals .",
    "the coexistence of different morphologies of molecules in their crystal phases may strongly influence the properties of such materials @xcite .",
    "this has practical impact not only in condensed - matter physics and materials science @xcite , but also in biochemistry and pharmacology @xcite , where polymorphism is known to crucially affect drug formulation and stability .",
    "hence , a clear understanding of the fundamental mechanisms ruling this phenomenon is desired in view of tailoring molecular materials with customized features .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of polymorphism in 6 t with a joint theoretical and experimental study .",
    "specifically , we aim to determine which of the experimentally observed phases is the more stable one .",
    "to do so , we combine a first - principle approach , based on density - functional theory ( dft ) and including van der waals interactions , with thermal desorption measurements .",
    "moreover , we propose and analyze a possible transition path from one structure to the other , and estimate the size of the corresponding energy barrier .",
    "the information about the crystal structure is complemented by an analysis of the electronic properties of selected systems along the transition path .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : systems and methods ] , we introduce the ht and lt polymorphs of 6 t and the theoretical and experimental methods that we use . sec .",
    "[ sec : relative stability of ht and lt ] adresses the relative stability of the two known polymorphs , both theoretically and experimentally . in sec .",
    "[ sec : transition path ] , we discuss the transition path and the electronic properties corresponding to several structures along that path .",
    ", @xmath1 , @xmath2 , as well as tilt ( @xmath3 ) , herringbone ( @xmath4 ) , and monoclinic angles ( @xmath5 ) are indicated .",
    "the dashed line marks the plane , which divides the unit cell of the lt polymorph in half.[fig : crystal structures],title=\"fig : \" ] [ structure - notation ]    .structural parameters of the ht and lt polymorphs as well as of intermeditate structures ( see sec . [",
    "sec : construction of the path ] ) .",
    "the lattice parameters of the lt polymorph are referred to the reduced unit cell ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : relative stability of ht and lt ] ) .",
    "lattice constants @xmath6 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as the monoclinic angles @xmath5 , the tilt angle @xmath3 , and the herringbone angle @xmath4 are displayed .",
    "[ tab : structural parameters ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a next step , we evaluate the total energies of the optimized intermediate structures . in this way",
    ", we are able to estimate the energy barrier between the ht and lt phases . the results of these calculations are reported in tab . [",
    "tab : relative energies ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : intermediate - structures_barrier]b .",
    "the relative energies with respect to the most stable polymorph , the lt phase , are displayed as a function of the reaction coordinate @xmath7 , which is defined by the lattice parameters and the angles @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "overall the barrier presents a _ top hat _ shape .",
    "while structure resembles the ht phase and is energetically very close to it , structure is similar in energy and shape to the lt phase ( see tab . [",
    "tab : relative energies ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "structures - are significantly less favored , exhibiting energies more than 0.5 ev / molecule higher compared to lt .",
    "the most unfavored polymorph is structure .",
    "the total energy exceeds that of the lt phase by about 0.7 ev per molecule , which represents the apex of the dome . considering an increase in energy by explicitely accounting for van der waals interactions",
    ", we estimate the upper bound of the barrier to be about 1 ev .",
    "similar results have been obtained for other organic crystals , such as _",
    "para_-sexiphenyl on a mica step - edge @xcite .",
    "we finally present , in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - bands ] , the electronic properties of selected intermediate structures , compared to the ht and lt ones .",
    "these results allow us to further characterize the predicted metastable structures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - bands ] the band structure and density of states ( dos ) of the three selected intermediates , and are shown in comparison with the stable polymorphs ht and lt .",
    "we notice the typical features of organic crystals ( see e.g. ref .",
    "[ ] ) . in both the valence and conduction regions ,",
    "subbands are arranged in pairs , according to the double multiplicity of the 6 t molecules in the unit cell .",
    "these features are reflected also in the dos , which presents in both cases relatively sharp peaks in the valence region , corresponding to the different subbands .",
    "the subbands in the conduction region are energetically closer to each other , and present overall increased dispersion compared to the valence region . the highest valence - bands ( vb ) and lowest conduction - bands ( cb ) are highlighted in green .",
    "both polymorphs have indirect kohn - sham ( ks ) band gaps of 1.2 and 1.1 ev for lt and ht , respectively .    in the lt phase",
    "the vb bandwidth is 0.2 ev , while it is larger ( 0.5 ev ) in the cb . for symmetry reasons",
    ", both bands are degenerate along the path from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and exhibit a small splitting between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the splitting is largest at the @xmath11-point and halfway inbetween the points @xmath12 and @xmath8 . in the ht phase ,",
    "the bandwidth is twice as large in the vb ( 0.4 ev ) , and slightly larger in the cb ( 0.6 ev ) , compared to lt .",
    "the largest splitting is found at @xmath11 and @xmath10 , as well as halfway between @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "bands are degenerate between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as well as between @xmath13 and @xmath12 .    for comparison",
    ", we have selected those structures ( , and ) , which mostly differ from each other in the arrangement of the molecules and in the energetics ( see figs . [",
    "fig : intermediate - structures_barrier]a and b ) .",
    "these intermediate structures belong to the space group @xmath14 , exhibiting trivial symmetry .",
    "these systems present indirect ks band gaps of 1.0 ev ( ) , 0.9 ev ( ) , and 1.2 ev ( ) .",
    "these values are comparable to those of the ht ( 1.1 ev ) and lt ( 1.2 ev ) phases .",
    "the lower stabilities of these systems with respect to the stable ht and lt polymorphs is evident from the band structures .",
    "in particular , in structure , which is clearly unfavored in the chosen transition path , a large band splitting is observed , in both valence and conduction regions .",
    "especially the occupied states feature sharp peaks in the dos .",
    "this is a signature of the lower symmetry of this system , compared to the stable ht and lt polymorphs .",
    "the other intermediate structures , and , which are structurally and energetically close to ht and lt , respectively , still present subbands , and the fingerprints of reduced symmetry , such as subband degeneracy , are less pronounced .",
    "overall , the bands exhibit low dispersion , especially for the and structures .",
    "this implies high effective carrier masses and therefore low charge - carrier mobilities in these regions .",
    "the bandwidths in the vbs decrease from 0.4 ev for and to 0.2 ev in structure . thus , structure ( ) shares the same bandwidth in the vb as the ht ( lt ) polymorph .",
    "the cb bandwidths tend to be larger with values of 0.6 ev ( structure ) , 0.7 ev ( structure ) and 0.7 ev ( structure ) , thus they are 0.1 ev larger than those of the ht and lt phase , respectively .",
    "we have presented a combined theoretical and experimental study on polymorphism in 6 t crystals .",
    "we have clarified that the lt phase is favored over the ht one by about 50 mev / molecule , as obtained from dft calculations , explicitly taking into account van der waals interactions .",
    "this result is in agreement with our thermal desorption measurements .",
    "our results confirm the importance of explicitly accounting for quantum effects and dispersive intermolecular interactions , to quantify the relative stability of different polymorphs in organic crystal structures .",
    "in addition , we have proposed a transition path between the two stable 6 t polymorphs , estimating the energy barrier between the ht and lt phase of about 1 ev / molecule .",
    "the results are supplemented by a thorough analysis of the electronic properties of the stable and selected intermediate structures .",
