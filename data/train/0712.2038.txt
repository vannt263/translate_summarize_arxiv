    "cdf has made inclusive jet cross section measurements using the @xmath4 algorithm and midpoint cone clustering algorithm .",
    "the recent measurements using these algorithms are based on the 1.0 and 1.13 fb@xmath5 of data , respectively , and cover the rapidity region up to @xmath6 which is much wider than @xmath7 in the previous measurements .",
    "the @xmath4 measurement was published in  @xcite and the results from the midpoint measurement are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : incjet ] .",
    "the measured cross sections are in agreement with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions based on cteq6.1 m pdf .",
    "the measurements in the forward region show that the experimental uncertainties are somewhat smaller than the pdf uncertainties , and this measurement is expected to further constrain the pdfs .    the dijet mass differential cross section was measured using the 1.13  @xmath8 of data with the midpoint algorithm .",
    "the measured dijet mass spectrum was found to be in good agreement with nlo pqcd predictions within the uncertainties .",
    "limits on the cross sections for new particles decaying into two jets have been worked out using this measurement .",
    "the @xmath1 dijet production cross section has been measured using 260 pb@xmath9 of data collected by triggering on two displaced tracks and two jets .",
    "@xmath1 dijet events are selected by requiring two jets with @xmath10 and @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 gev , respectively , which are tagged as @xmath13-jets by a secondary vertex algorithm .",
    "the measured @xmath1 differential cross section is compared to pythia tune a  @xcite , herwig with jimmy  @xcite , and mc@nlo  @xcite with and without jimmy as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "tune a refers to a special set of pythia parameters tuned to give a reasonable description of the underlying event ( ue ) , and jimmy is a program which can be used in herwig and mc@nlo to add multiple parton interactions to events to improve the description of ue .",
    "mc@nlo+jimmy provides the best description of the data indicating the importance of both the next - to - leading order contribution and ue effect .",
    "the @xmath15+jets and @xmath3-jets production has been studied intensively at cdf .",
    "the studies of these processes provide important tests of pqcd predictions at high momentum transfers .",
    "final states containing @xmath15 and ( @xmath13-)jets are signal channels for many interesting processes such as @xmath16 or single top production , as well as searches for the higgs boson in the @xmath17 channel and physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) such as supersymmetry .",
    "the production of @xmath15+jets via qcd constitutes a large background to these processes , and thus it is essential to understand these processes accurately .",
    "the @xmath18+jets cross sections were measured using @xmath19 events from the 320 pb@xmath5 of data for four inclusive jet multiplicities ( @xmath20 ) , and compared to nlo pqcd predictions from mcfm  @xcite and lo matrix element ( me ) + parton shower ( ps ) monte carlo predictions based on the ckkw  @xcite and mlm ( as in alpgen  @xcite ) matching schemes .",

    "good agreement was observed between data and nlo pqcd predictions from mcfm  @xcite up to the @xmath29 bin where nlo predictions are available .",
    "the ratio of the data to the lo pqcd calculations indicates that the lo pqcd predictions underestimate the data by a factor of about 1.4 and this factor is constant over inclusive jet multiplicities up to the @xmath31 bin .",
