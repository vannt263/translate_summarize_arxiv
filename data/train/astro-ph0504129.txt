    "the x - ray states of black hole binary systems have been re - defined recently in terms of quantitative criteria that utilize both x - ray energy spectra and power density spectra ( pds ) @xcite .",
    "this effort was undertaken in response to the lessons of extensive monitoring campaigns with the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) , which revealed the full complexity of spectral and timing evolution exhibited by accreting black - hole binary systems @xcite .    the redefinition of x - ray states uses four criteria : @xmath0 , the ratio of the disk flux to the total flux ( both unabsorbed ) at 2 - 20 kev ; the power - law photon index ( @xmath1 ) at energies below any break or cutoff ; the integrated rms power ( @xmath2 ) in the pds at 0.110 hz , expressed as a fraction of the average source count rate ; and the integrated rms amplitude ( @xmath3 ) of a quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) detected in the range of 0.130 hz .",
    "pds criteria ( @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) utilize a broad energy range , and the bandwidth of the _ rxte _ pca instrument for typical x - ray sources is effectively 230 kev .",
    "it had been known for decades that the energy spectra of outbursting black holes often exhibit composite spectra consisting of two broadband components .",
    "there is a multi - temperature accretion disk @xcite with a characteristic temperature near 1 kev .",
    "* thermal state * designations draw attention to those times when the radiation is dominated by the heat from the inner accretion disk .",
    "the thermal state ( formerly the `` high / soft '' state ) is defined @xcite by the following three conditions : ( 1 ) the disk contributes more than 75% of the total unabsorbed flux at 220 kev , i.e. @xmath4 , ( 2 ) there are no qpos present with integrated amplitude above 0.5% of the mean count rate , i.e. @xmath5 , and ( 3 ) the integrated power continuum is low , with @xmath6 .    in principle , the normalization constant for the thermal component may allow numerical estimates of the radius of the inner accretion disk ( @xmath7 ) , if the source distance and disk inclination are accurately known @xcite",
    ". however , such estimates depend on disk models computed under general relativity ( gr ) , with careful attention to the inner disk boundary condition and to effects of radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "the ongoing efforts to utilize gr disk models and consider all forms of systematic problems in dealing with the inner disk boundary condition may yield reliable measures of @xmath7 .",
    "this would lead to estimates of the black - hole spin parameter for cases where the black - hole mass is well constrained via measurements of companion star motion in the binary system .",
    "there are other occasions when the spectrum of an outbursting black - hole binary exhibits substantial non - thermal emission in the form of an x - ray power - law component",
    ". observations with _ cgro_ossie were particularly valuable in showing that there were two types of non - thermal spectra @xcite , and this perspective has been confirmed with _",
    "rxte_. spectral fits yield two characteristic values for the photon index .",
    "there is a hard state with @xmath8 , usually with an exponential decrease beyond @xmath9 kev ) , and there is a steep power law ( @xmath10 ) , with no apparent cutoff . in each case , the corresponding pds also show distinct differences , relative to the pds in the thermal state .",
    "the * hard state * has been clearly associated with the presence of a steady type of radio jet @xcite .",
    "considerations hard states of for several black - hole binaries allows a definition that is again based on three x - ray conditions : ( 1 ) @xmath11 , i.e. the power - law contributes at least 80% of the unabsorbed 220 kev flux , ( 2 ) @xmath12 , for a power - law model , cutoff power law , or broken power - law ( using @xmath13 ) , as appropriate , and ( 3 ) the pds yields @xmath14 . in the hard x - ray state , the accretion - disk component is either absent or it is modified in the sense of appearing comparatively cool and large .",
    "the * steep power law * ( spl ) state is linked to the strength and properties of the non - thermal spectrum with @xmath10 .",
    "qpos are frequently seen when the flux from the spl begins to compete with thermal component @xcite .",
    "the spl state re - defines the `` very high '' state , which was brought into use when black hole qpos were first discovered and believed to rare and confined to high luminosity @xcite .",
    "_ cgro _ observations have shown that the spl may extend to 800 kev or higher @xcite . this forces consideration of non - thermal comptonization models @xcite .",
    "the qpos impose additional requirements for an oscillation mechanism that must be intimately tied to the electron acceleration mechanism , since the qpos are fairly coherent ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) and strongest above 6 kev , i.e. above the limit of the thermal spectrum , which remains visible during the spl state .",
    "the spl is further distinguished by its prevalence when high - frequency qpos are seen ( 7 sources ; 100 - 450 hz ) , and the spl tends to dominate black - hole binary spectra as the luminosity approaches the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "the spl state is defined by : ( 1 ) @xmath16 , ( 2 ) @xmath17 , and ( 3 ) either @xmath18 while a qpo ( 0.1 to 30 hz ) is present in the pds ( with @xmath19 ) , * or * @xmath20 with no qpos .",
    "samples of the energy spectra and pds for the three states of active accretion are illustrated for many black hole binaries and candidates by mcclintock and remillard @xcite . here",
    ", the temporal evolution of states and the corresponding luminosities are shown for three cases .",
    "our data selections for _ rxte _ pointed observations exclude results when the average flux is below 2 mcrab ( or @xmath21 erg @xmath22 ) , since contamination by faint sources in the galactic plane within the @xmath23 pca field of view may then skew the spectral parameters derived for the black hole binary .",
    "the temporal evolution of x - ray states for the case of gro  j165540 ( 1996 - 1997 outburst ) is shown in fig.[fig : lc1655 ] .",
    "the asm light curve is displayed in the top panel , while the unabsorbed flux derived from spectral fits to _ rxte _ pointed observations @xcite are shown in the bottom panel . the plotting symbol is used to represent the x - ray state : thermal ( red x ) , hard ( blue square ) , spl ( green triangle ) , and any intermediate type ( yellow circle ) .",
    "this outburst of gro  j1655 - 40 is almost entirely confined to the softer x - ray states ( 43 thermal cases and 16 spls ) , while 3 hard state observations are recorded as the source nears quiescence .",
    "the two intermediate cases happen to be very similar to each other , and their properties lie just beyond the boundaries for the thermal state .",
    "the disk fraction in the 2 - 20 kev flux is high ( @xmath24 ) , and there are no qpos , but the integrated power continuum is slightly elevated , with @xmath25 .        the temporal evolution of x - ray states for xte  j1550564 ( 1998 - 1999 outburst ) is shown in fig .",

    "spectral modeling efforts follow sobczak et  al .",
    "@xcite , except that a broken power law model is used when it improves the fit significantly , and this happens frequently for observations before mjd 51140 .",
    "this outburst exhibits several state transitions , and the thermal state is the most common condition ( 106 cases ) .",
    "the spl state ( 30 cases ) is again seen when the source reaches highest luminosity ; however , the distribution in luminosity is broad ( green triangles , fig .",

    "all three states are seen in the range of 14 @xmath26 erg @xmath22 s@xmath27 .",
    "there are many observations ( 60 ) of intermediate conditions ( yellow circles ) during this outburst .",
    "those in the mjd range 5107851113 display values for the photon index and rms power that lie between the spl and hard states ( see @xcite for more detailed discussions ) , and they coincide with the appearance of `` c '' type qpos that vary substantially in frequency ( ( 0.110 hz ) @xcite . near mjd 51300",
    "there is a different group of intermediate cases that lie between the thermal and hard states ; they show a hard photon index but there are elevated values of @xmath28 contributed by the decaying thermal component .",
    "this 1998 - 1999 outburst of xte  j1550564 was followed by successively weaker outbursts ( not shown ) in 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 .",
    "the outburst of 2000 again shows multi - state spectral evolution , but the three subsequent and weaker outbursts appear entirely constrained to the hard state ( see below ) .",
    "gx339 - 4 is chosen as a third example to display ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lcgx339 ] ) the temporal evolution of x - ray states in a black - hole binary system .",
    "this source is particularly interesting for two reasons : the relatively high accretion rate from the companion star produces frequent x - ray outbursts , and the source is known for extended hard - state episodes , making it a favorite target ( along with cyg x-1 ) for radio studies and investigations of the disk : jet connection @xcite .",
    "three outbursts and a long interval in the hard state ( 1997 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcgx339 ] .",
    "gx3394 was in a quiescent state during 2000 and 2001 .",
    "all three active x - ray states are represented by gx339 - 4 : 123 thermal states , 95 hard states , 19 spls , and 37 that are intermediate .",
    "many researchers choose to investigate the spectral evolution of accreting black holes in terms of a hardness - intensity diagrams ( hid ) , where changes in x - ray brightness are tracked vs. a simple `` hardness ratio '' , i.e. the ratio of detector counts in two energy bands @xcite .",
    "the hid is also the format chosen for the `` unified model for radio jets '' proposed by fender , belloni , & gallo @xcite .",
    "having defined the x - ray states and their temporal evolution for gro  j1655 - 40 , xte  j1550 - 564 , and gx339 - 4 in the preceding figures , we now display these same results as hids .",
    "these data occupy three of the four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : colint3 ] .",
    "the horizontal scale of this plot utilizes the hard color ( @xmath29 ) defined by muno , remillard , & chakrabarty @xcite with a normalization scheme that compensates for pca gain adjustments and detector evolution that occur during the _ rxte _ mission .",
    "pca spectra of the crab nebula yield values at @xmath30 , with a normalized intensity of 2500 c s@xmath27 pcu@xmath27 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : colint3 ] , each observation is plotted in the hid with a symbol type and color that shows the x - ray state , using the same conventions of earlier figures .    , and this line is hypothesized to coincide with the jet line in the schematic for the unified model of radio jets ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fender ] ) .",
    "similar @xmath29 limits for the spl states of gro  j1655 - 40 and xte  j1550 - 564 are evident in fig .",

    "[ fig : colint3 ] shows a superposition of color : intensity : state results for xte  j1550 - 564 during the three weak outbursts noted in  2 .",
    "for this one panel , there is a slight change in the definition of the hard state .",
    "the lower limit for the spectral index is shifted by 0.1 , allowing @xmath31 , while keeping other criteria the same .",
    "this modification is needed to avoid an artificial exclusion of about half of these observations ( @xmath32 ) from the hard state .",
    "[ fig : colint3 ] again shows that some outbursts can be dominated by thermal and spl states ( e.g. gro  j1655 - 40 , and additional sources , such as 4u  1543 - 47 and xte  j2012 + 381 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "some outbursts ( xte  j1550 - 564 2001 - 2003 , and also xte  1118 + 480 and gs  1324 - 64 ) are locked in the hard state .",
    "complex , multi - state outbursts are seen in xte  j1550 - 564 ( 1998 and 2000 ) , gx339 - 4 , and sources such as xte  j1859 + 226 , 4u  1630 - 47 , and h1743 - 322 .",
    "we wish to compare these state - represented hids with the unified model for jets @xcite .",
    "the schematic representation of this model is reproduced here for convenience , and further discussions by fender are available in these proceedings .",
    "gx339 - 4 obviously plays an important role in shaping the dynamics illustrated in the unified model for jets .",
    "however , as recognized by the authors@xcite , and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colint3 ] , a black hole binary in a given outburst may follow a track that may be more restricted or more complicated than the tracks shown in the model .",
    "the schematic for the disk - jet connection describes not only the flow of states ( in the older state conventions ) , but it also specifies a `` jet line '' ( vertical , solid line center - left in hid of fig .  [",
    "fig : fender ] .",
    "the jet line represents the boundary between the presence and absence of a steady radio jet , and it also marks a line of conditions where ballistic ejections are most probable .",
    "can such a vertical line be recognized in terms of the revised definitions of x - ray states ?",
    "the answer appears to be yes. corbel et al .",
    "@xcite have investigated the radio properties of some spl and intermediate - state observations of xte  j1650 - 500 and other sources and suggest that the jet terminates at the boundary between the intermediate state and the spl . in fig .",
    "[ fig : colint3 ] , this transition is shown to have a distinct location on the hid , as the maximum @xmath29 value for the spl state is in the range 0.450.48 for each of the three black - hole binary systems .",
    "we support the suggestion that this state transition line corresponds to the jet line and encourage further studies with x - ray and radio data for many sources .",
    "the hypothesis that the hard end of the spl state represents the jet line is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339hid ] . here , the data for gx339 - 4 ( bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : colint3 ] ) is redisplayed with two changes . the 37 intermediate designations are resolved into 3 groups , to best describe the nearest two states for a given case .",
    "there are 29 observations with properties that lie between the thermal and spl states .",
    "they continue to be plotted as yellow circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339hid ] .",
    "all of these have photon index @xmath33 ; fifteen have thermal - like values of @xmath2 but exhibit either weak qpos or relatively low values of @xmath28 ; fourteen have spl - like values of @xmath2 and @xmath28 , but there are no qpos ( although some have broad power features in their pds ) . the second group ( 7 cases ) appear to be intermediate between the hard and spl states , since they have low @xmath28 values ( i.e. nonthermal spectra ) with @xmath34 ( i.e. photon indices between the hard and spl states ) .",
    "this group is plotted with black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339hid ] .",
    "the single , remaining case is considered to be intermediate between hard and thermal states , since @xmath35 but @xmath36 ; this is plotted with a black open square .",
    "the effort to synthesize our definitions of x - ray states with the schematic model for radio jets is encouraging .",
    "the identity of the spl state and the distinctions between different types of intermediate states are well preserved on the hids . however , no new insights have been gained , thus far , that are directly pertinent to our understanding of the jet mechanism .",
    "such interests can be served by studying the parameters that define x - ray states in greater detail .",
    "there are three continuous x - ray parameters ( apart from `` presence of qpos '' ) that are used to define x - ray states @xcite .",
    "these are plotted vs. hard color in fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339hr ] to further investigate how x - ray properties vary across state transitions and across any hypothetical jet line .",
    "the symbol choice represents the x - ray state , as defined for fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339hid ] .    as one proceeds from right to left in fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339hr ] ( i.e. jet `` on '' towards jet `` off '' ) , there do appear to be substantial changes in both the photon index ( top panel ) and the rms power continuum ( bottom panel ) at the point where the intermediate ( hard / spl ) conditions shift into the spl state ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the disk fraction in the 220 kev band ( middle panel ) appears to be a more continuous function of @xmath29 , and the x - ray appearance of the disk above 2 kev begins where the hard state ( blue squares ) transitions to hard  spl intermediate conditions ( black circles ) .",
    "the disappearance of the steady radio jet during `` hard to soft '' x - ray spectral transitions is well known @xcite , and the behavior of the photon index ( top panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : gx339hr ] ) does suggest that this occurs near @xmath37 .",
    "however , less attention has been paid to changes in the power spectrum across this transition .",
    "the integrated power in the pds ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339hr ] ) is clearly correlated with the value of @xmath29 and the x - ray state .",
    "what is potentially most interesting about this relationship is the frequency composition of the excess power that follows the evolution of the source in and out of the hard state .",
    "representative , average pds were computed for the different states of gx339 - 4 using 72 thermal - state observations with @xmath38 and 17 spl observations with @xmath39 . for the intermediate and hard states ,",
    "we find pds maxima that are a function of brightness , and there are low - frequency qpos in some of the brighter hard states .",
    "these topics needs to be investigated further . for the present purpose of illustrating state - specific pds in gx339 - 4",
    ", we select intermediate and hard - state observations with lower x - ray intensity , 25100 c s@xmath27 pcu@xmath27 , to limit the secular variations with brightness and to represent these states at luminosity levels typically seen in other sources . within these brightness limits , we select 6 intermediate states with @xmath40 and 26 hard states with @xmath41 . the pds ( weighted averages ) for the four states are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gx339pds ] .    in the spl state , there is a qpo near 5.8 hz ( @xmath42 in the full pca band ) , with another peak ( @xmath43 ) at the first harmonic .",
    "note , however , that the average spl results smear over qpos with different amplitudes and frequencies , which are better investigated using individual spl observations .",
    "the pds for the intermediate ( spl / hard ) and hard states appear quite different ; they exhibit broad power peaks @xcite with much higher amplitude .",
    "these features can be treated as a broad lorentzian peak superposed on a much broader power continuum , i.e. a quadratic function in log(@xmath44 ) vs. log(@xmath45 ) with a fit range of 0.01 - 1000 hz . with this type of pds model ,",
    "the intermediate ( spl / hard ) state yields a broad power peak that is centered at @xmath46 hz with very low coherence parameter : @xmath47 .",
    "most of the pds power ( @xmath48 ) is taken up in this broad feature .",
    "the hard state pds can be interpreted with a stronger broad peak centered near 0.2 hz with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "x - ray astronomers have been studying pds with `` band - limited noise '' or broad power peaks in detail for many years @xcite .",
    "what is perhaps new , here , is the demonstrated need to interpret these features as an x - ray signature that is fundamentally connected to the jet mechanism . these broad power peaks are strongest in the hard state and they seem to form only on the right side of the jet line , i.e. the conditions associated with quasi - steady radio emission .",
    "pottschmidt et al @xcite conducted a detailed analysis of multiple broad peaks with lorentzian profiles in the pds of cyg x-1 in the hard and intermediate states .",
    "it was shown that the pds are best modeled as a superposition of three strong and broad features , e.g near 0.2 , 2 , and 6 hz , with correlated variations in frequency and with the occasional presence of a fourth peak near 40 hz .",
    "it was further shown that the stability of the hard state against transitions to intermediate - type flares is related to the strength of the third lorentzian .",
    "these considerations show that the fourier components related to the hard state are more complicated than the simplified results shown here .",
    "however , the point needs to be made that all of these broad power peaks tend to disappear with the hard power - law spectrum when an accreting black hole crosses the jet line .",
    "one can imagine the origin of these broad power peaks in very different ways .",
    "in keplerian terms , the wide range of excess power ( i.e. 0.01 to 20 hz ) corresponds to gravitational radii of 305000 @xmath51 for a 10 black hole with low values of the spin parameter .",
    "if some instability at these radii creates the excess pds power while it furnishes the corona that supplies plasma for the jet , then the base of the jet would be unexpectedly large ( 0.5 light seconds across the maximum diameter ) .",
    "this picture would seem to be ruled out by the high coherence and ms phase lags measured for cyg x-1 in the hard and intermediate states ( e.g. @xcite ) .    since magnetic fields are widely believed to play a central role in the formation of jets in black - hole systems",
    ", it may be more productive to consider the pds power peaks in terms of wave phenomena in a magnetized disk .",
    "it has been argued that a vertical magnetic field can excite an `` accretion - ejection '' instability @xcite leading to magnetic spiral waves that may produce both qpos ( at the co - rotation radius for the spiral wave and keplerian flow in the disk ) and alfven waves to excite the corona .",
    "the broad power peaks in the pds could be seen as another observational challenge for this model and for mhd simulations of magnetized accretion disks .",
    "correlations between qpo frequencies and the frequencies associated with broad power peaks have been demonstrated for hard and intermediate state observations of both black - hole binaries and accreting neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the neutron - star connection naturally motivates the presumption that the behavior of x - ray power peaks is dictated by standard accretion - disk physics .",
    "however , the consideration of black - hole hard states and the jet line motivates an alternative viewpoint : the frequency relationships for broad power peaks are primarily exhibiting the behavior of non - thermal processes that are related to the jet mechanism . as a corollary question , we may need to understand why jets appears to be less efficient in the hard states of accreting neutron stars @xcite",
