    "the spectrum of the x - ray background ( xrb ) over the 1 - 7  kev band is a power - law of energy index 0.4 ( gendreau et al .",
    "1995 ) which is flatter than that of any known class of extragalactic source . following the original suggestion of setti & woltjer ( 1989 ) ,",
    "it is commonly assumed that this is due to the xrb being dominated by many absorbed sources .",
    "these sources , with different absorbing column densities and redshifts , combine to give the observed xrb spectrum ( madau , ghisellini & fabian 1994 ; matt & fabian 1994 ; comastri et al .  1995 ; wilman & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "the absorbed energy is presumably reradiated in the far infrared ( fir ) band , as observed in nearby heavily absorbed active galactic nuclei ( agn ) like that in the luminous _ iras _ galaxy ngc6240 ( vignati et al .",
    "the residual harder x - ray emission which penetrates the absorbing medium , and the tail of the reradiated emission in the submillimetre band from such an source both exhibit a negative k - correction .",
    "this means that obscured agn should be detectable to large redshifts in both bands .",
    "observations of the xrb with _",
    "chandra _ show that much ( more than 80 per cent ) of it is resolved into point sources in the 28  kev band ( brandt et al .",
    "2000 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "more than half the intensity is due to a combination of hard sources identified with either otherwise normal bright galaxies or in optically faint or even invisible galaxies .",
    "deep 850-@xmath7 m submillimetre observations with scuba show that much ( more than 80 per cent ) of the submillimetre background seen by _ cobe_-firas ( fixsen et al .",
    "1998 ) at this wavelength is resolved into discrete sources ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a key question is what fraction of the deep x - ray and submillimetre source populations are related .",
    "the far - infrared and submillimetre background represents a significant part of the energy output of objects in the universe .",
    "if the contribution of starbursts and agn to the background can be separated using deep x - ray images , then the relative importance of high - mass star formation and agn in heating the dust responsible for this emission can be determined .",
    "recent modelling suggests that the agn fraction in the submillimetre background is about 20 per cent ( almaini , lawrence & boyle 1999 ; fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; gunn & shanks 1999 ) .",
    "the uncertainty is such that agn may contribute in total between 1050 per cent of the total energy output of stars ( fabian 1999 ) .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) have used the scuba instrument at the jcmt ( holland et al 1999 ) to study the submillimetre sources in seven massive clusters of galaxies at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4 , exploiting the gravitational lensing magnification from the clusters to make an exceptionally deep 850-@xmath7 m survey for background sources .",
    "_ chandra _ images of two of the clusters , a2390 and a1835 , have recently been obtained which , owing to the superb angular resolution , probe much deeper than any previous x - ray images of these regions , for example the _ rosat_-hri limit of @xmath8erg@xmath9@xmath10 to the 0.12.0kev x - ray flux of the scuba source smmj14011 + 0252 in a1835 ( ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) . here",
    "we study the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray limits to the flux of the scuba sources and conversely scuba limits on the _ chandra _ sources found in the images .",
    "only one source is marginally detected in both wavebands .",
    "we then discuss the implications for obscured agn models .",
    "_ chandra _ observed a2390 on 1999 november 5 for a livetime of 9,126  s and a1835 on 1999 december 11 for a total of 19,626  s. for each observation the cluster lies close to the aimpoint of the telescope on the acis - s back - illuminated ccd chip .",
    "only mild temporal variations in count rate are seen through the observations so we use the whole exposure in this work .",
    "a 7-arcsec pointing offset evident in the a1835 field from the position of the cluster x - ray peak and several other source identified in the field has been removed .",
    "we estimate that the source positions from the _ chandra _ images are accurate to 1@xmath11 rms .",
    "the analysis of the cluster emission will be presented elsewhere ; here we restrict ourselves to the positions of the scuba sources and of three x - ray sources in the _ chandra _ fields which lie within the scuba field ( i.e.  within 1.5  arcmin of the cluster centre ; table 1 ) .",
    "a further possible ( @xmath12 )",
    "x - ray source in the a2390 field is also discussed since it is spatially coincident with a tentative ( @xmath13 ) scuba source .",
    "no point - like x - ray sources are seen in the scuba region of the _ chandra _ field of a1835 .",
    "the x - ray data were analysed using images in the 0.52  kev and 27  kev bands with one - arcsec pixels .",
    "the sources detected in the scuba field of a2390 appear principally in just 4 neighbouring chandra pixels ( a few counts from the brightest sources occupy 2 further pixels ) .",
    "we therefore adopt a region of 4 sq .",
    "arcsec when estimating source fluxes and limits .",
    "the cluster emission means that the background is not flat , and so the background has been determined by averaging the 8 neighbouring pixels in images formed with 10 by 10 arcsec pixels , excluding the source pixel .",
    "upper limits in the x - ray band have been obtained by using the bayesian method of kraft , burrows & nousek ( 1990 ) and are quoted at the 99 per cent confidence level ( table 2 ) .",
    "we assume galactic columns of @xmath14 for a2390 and @xmath15 for a1835 .",
    "the submillimetre , radio and optical imaging of a1835 used here is discussed in detail in ivison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , while the submillimetre observations of a2390 are detailed in smail et al .",

    "( hst ) is described in pell et al .",
    "in addition , there is deep 6.7@xmath7 m and 15-@xmath7 m _ iso _ imaging of a2390 ( altieri et al .",
    "1999 ; lemonon et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is sensitive to hot dust emission from background galaxies out to @xmath16 .    in fig .  1 we show overlays of the _ chandra _ and scuba images on optical images of a1835 and a2390 .",
    "we note that the brightest _ chandra _ source , cxouj215334.0 + 174240 , is associated with a relatively large ( 4@xmath11 total extent ) mid - type spiral with a blue nucleus and a faint companion .",
    "this galaxy has a colour and apparent magnitude similar to those expected for a slightly reddened @xmath17 mid - type spiral at @xmath18 .",
    "while the next brightest x - ray source , cxouj215333.2 + 174209 has a more amorphous counterpart , with a bright compact nucleus and an asymmetric envelope and has a much bluer colour , its redshift is not strongly constrained by the current data .",
    "counterparts to the remaining two _ chandra _ sources are not seen in the optical imaging ( although there is a very faint object in the vicinity of cxouj215334.4 + 174205 ) ; if they are background galaxies then , after correction for lensing amplification , they must be fainter than @xmath19 .",
    "cxouj215334.0 + 174240 is the only one of the four _ chandra _ sources detected at 1.4  ghz with the vla , at a flux density of @xmath20 mjy , the 3-@xmath21 limits on the remainder being @xmath22 mjy .",
    "for the two x - ray sources which are detected in both x - ray bands we have determined an x - ray spectral index , @xmath23 from the flux ratios .",
    "these are both unphysically negative ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; we define all spectral indices according to @xmath26 ) and thus indicate intrinsic absorption .",
    "the brightest source , cxouj215334.0 + 174240 , has @xmath27 counts , which enables a crude spectral analysis to be performed .",
    "a straight power - law spectrum with galactic absorption is a poor fit and yields an energy index of @xmath25 . including additional soft x - ray absorption allows a better fit , although with no firm constraints on the index .",
    "the absorption however must exceed @xmath28 at the 90 per cent confidence level .",
    "note that the intrinsic absorption will be approximately @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the redshift of the source .",
    "for an assumed energy index of 1 , typical of quasars , and the redshift indicated by the optical colours , we find @xmath31@xmath32 , and an unabsorbed intrinsic 210  kev luminosity of 2.7@xmath33 , for @xmath341 , respectively .",
    "after correction for the lensing amplification factor of about 2 , the source has an intrinsic @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "this makes it a strong contender to be one of the first genuine type - ii quasars ( see discussions in halpern et al .",
    "1999 ; vignati et al .  1999 ; franceschini et al 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray limits on the scuba sources in the a1835 field are about 100 times deeper than previously achieved using _ rosat _ data ( ivison et al .",
    "we have produced two submillimetre - to - x - ray spectral indices , @xmath38 , using the measured values at 850@xmath7 m and 2  kev in our rest frame . rather than obtain one x - ray estimate for the spectral flux at 2  kev from a whole band measurement , which would be biased by the most sensitive lower energy end of the band ,",
    "we have estimated it by converting the observed counts to fluxes in the 0.52 and 27  kev bands ( listed in table 2 ) , using the response matrix of the acis - s chip and assuming an intrinsic energy index of 1 ( which is roughly appropriate for the scattered flux from an absorbed agn ) .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we compare expected values of @xmath39 as a function of redshift in fig .  2 for various classes of observed objects , both starbursts and agn .",
    "we select 3c273 as an example of a powerful quasar , and use the submillimetre data of neugebauer , soifer & miley ( 1985 ) in our model ; arp220 as a starburst using the submillimetre data of sanders et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the x - ray data of iwasawa ( 1999 ) ; and ngc6240 as a powerful obscured ( compton - thick ) agn using an estimate of the submillimetre spectrum based on that from arp220 normalised by the fir luminosity and the _ bepposax _ spectrum from vignati et al .",
    "we also show how @xmath39 changes as the absorption in ngc6240 decreases from the measured value of @xmath40 to @xmath41 and also if the scattered fraction drops to 1 per cent .",
    "data from several quasars at @xmath42 are shown for comparison with the 3c273 prediction .",
    "the typical limits on @xmath39 for the scuba galaxies are @xmath43 ( at 99 per cent confidence ) . combining the limits for the 6 galaxies we obtain a 99 per cent confidence limit on a typical scuba galaxy of @xmath44 , with the strongest constraints for individual galaxies being @xmath45 for smmj14011 + 0252 ( @xmath0 ) and smmj14009 + 0252 in the a1835 field .",
    "thus the indices for this population are straightforwardly consistent with starbursts .",
    "they do not resemble compton - thin agn at any redshift and are inconsistent with the spectrum of ngc6240 at any redshift .",
    "if these galaxies host a powerful agn then either a ) reprocessed radiation from the agn provides only a minor fraction of the submillimetre luminosity , or b ) the source must be compton thick and in addition the fraction of any scattered x - ray emission must be less than one per cent .",
    "we note that x - ray limits on the hyperluminous _ iras _ galaxy f15307 + 3252 at @xmath46 , which does contain an agn since broad scattered emission lines are seen ( hines et al .",
    "1995 ) , show that it must have a very low x - ray scattered fraction ( @xmath47 per cent ) , possibly due to intrinsic absorption of the scattered emission ( fabian et al .",
    "if this is typical of obscured agn more powerful than ngc6240 , then the present results would be consistent with obscured agn provided that they are at relatively high redshift ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "of the four _ chandra _ sources we identified in our fields , two have probable optical counterparts suggesting that they are distant disk galaxies .",
    "the colours and luminosity of the brightest of these suggest it is an @xmath17 mid - type galaxy at @xmath16 . if the two optically - unidentified _ chandra _ sources are agn , and the host galaxies have luminosities of @xmath17 or greater , then they must be at @xmath49 , or be intrinsically reddened .",
    "obscuration of both agn and surrounding spheroid is required by some models for the xrb ( fabian 1999 ) .",
    "it is possible for these dust - enshrouded strongly - obscured agn to be undetected in our 850-@xmath7 m scuba maps if their dust is typically much hotter than 40k . comparing the radio flux and scuba limit for the brightest _ chandra _ galaxy cxouj215334.0 + 174240 (  2 )",
    ", the redshift @xmath30 and dust temperature @xmath50 of the source must satisfy the relationship @xmath51k .",
    "taking the redshift constraint from the optical , @xmath52 , we derive @xmath53k .",
    "such sources would not contribute substantially to the submillimetre background at @xmath54 mm , but might at shorter wavelengths .",
    "eventual comparison with _ iso _ imaging may shed further light on the nature of the dust emission in these sources .    in summary ,",
    "_ chandra _ and scuba observations have been combined to probe the relation between the faint x - ray and submillimetre sky .",
    "only one marginal source is seen in both datasets , and so in general we find deep submillimetre limits from scuba on the x - ray sources found using _",
    "chandra _ and deep x - ray limits from _",
    "chandra _ on the scuba - selected sources .",
    "the limits on background sources in these fields are particularly strong due to amplification by gravitational lensing .    for the scuba galaxies",
    ", we can not completely rule out the presence of either an obscured , weak agn or a more powerful compton - thick agn in which any scattered flux is also very weak or absorbed .",
    "however , the simplest explanation of our results on the scuba sources is that they are predominantly powered by starbursts .",
    "clearly the current sample is small and so we can not make any definitive statement about the whole scuba population .",
    "we note that at the moment our conclusions are not inconsistent with suggestions that agn powering 20 per cent of the scuba population , although a substantially higher fraction would be difficult to accommodate .    for the _ chandra _ sources in the a2390 field",
    "we find that they have optically faint counterparts , @xmath5527 .",
    "we identify one source as a probable type - ii obscured quasar at @xmath56 .",
    "we suggest that the remaining , typically fainter sources are either more distant , @xmath49 , or intrinsically reddened .",
    "observations of these fields in the near - infrared are urgently needed to test the nature of these sources .",
