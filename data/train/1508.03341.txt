    "<S> in quantum communication protocols the existence of a shared reference frame between two spatially separated parties is normally presumed . however , in many practical situations we are faced with the problem of misaligned reference frames . in this paper , we study communication between two inertial observers who have partial knowledge about the lorentz transformation that relates their frames of reference . </S>",
    "<S> since every lorentz transformation can be decomposed into a pure boost followed by a rotation , we begin by analysing the effects on communication when the parties have partial knowledge about the transformation relating their frames , when the transformation is either a rotation or pure boost . </S>",
    "<S> this then enables us to investigate how the efficiency of communication is affected due to partially correlated inertial reference frames related by an arbitrary lorentz transformation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show how the results of previous studies where reference frames are completely uncorrelated are recovered from our results in appropriate limits . </S>"
