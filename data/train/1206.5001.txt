    "depending on the particular decay channel , we find a promising signal - to - background ratio at the price of a very small event rate .",
    "higgs self - coupling measurements for a sm higgs in this particular mass range are typically afflicted with large backgrounds , so that achieving maximal sensitivity requires the combination of as many channels as possible .",
    "for dedicated selection cuts we obtain signal cross sections in higgs pair production of the order of 0.01 to 0.1  fb and measurements will therefore involve large data sets of the 14 tev run with a good understanding of the involved experimental systematics .",
    "searches for unboosted kinematics of the higgs bosons do not allow any constraint on the trilinear coupling or total cross - section to be made .",

    "a necessary condition for sensitivity in these channels is a sufficiently good @xmath116 reconstruction , but more importantly , a small fake rate .",
    "unfortunately , while boosting the higgses increases @xmath91 , it leads us into a region of phase space which lacks sensitivity to the trilinear coupling .",
    "in addition to inclusive dihiggs production we find that dihiggs production in association with a hard jet shows an improved sensitivity to the trilinear higgs coupling .",
    "however to exploit this scenario still requires the use of boosted techniques which require thorough evaluation on data .    assuming the efficiency for @xmath116-tagging and the hadronic higgs reconstruction as outlined in this work are confirmed using data , the @xmath245 and @xmath246 channels can be used to constrain the higgs self - coupling in the sm at the lhc with a data set of several hundred inverse femtobarns .",
    "the analysis strategies developed in this paper will also help to improve bounds on dihiggs production in scenarios with strong electroweak symmetry breaking and related models , which also predict enhanced dihiggs production cross sections @xcite .",
