    "the current paradigm for the central source in agn postulates a black hole ( bh ) with a mass of @xmath2 m@xmath3 , and a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc that presumably extends to the innermost stable circular orbit around the black hole .",
    "this disc is supposed to be responsible for the broad , quasi - thermal emission component in the optical - uv spectrum of agn ( the so - called big blue bump ) . at energies above @xmath02 kev , a power - law like component is observed .",
    "this is attributed to emission by a hot corona ( @xmath4 k ) overlying the thin disc .",
    "the corona up - comptonizes the disc soft photons to produce the hard ( @xmath5 kev ) x - ray emission .",
    "an fe k@xmath1 line is also detected , produced either by fluorescence on cold matter at @xmath6 kev or by photoionization of h - like or he - like fe at 6.9 kev and 6.7 kev , respectively .",
    "this feature is believed to be emitted on the surface of the accretion disc , from the reprocessing of the x - rays . in many cases",
    "the line is resolved , and its width can , in theory , constrain the position of the inner radius of the disc and the spin of the central bh .",
    "the agn x  ray emission is strongly variable , even on time scales as short as a few hundred seconds , both in flux and in the shape of the observed energy spectrum .",
    "these variations can provide information on the physical conditions , the size , and the geometry of the x  ray emitting region .",
    "regarding the flux variability , although the broad band power spectra of agn are not well understood , the identification of characteristic time scales in them , combined with the large range in the masses of the bhs that have been studied so far , can constrain ( to some degree ) the size and the geometry of the x  ray source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , recent detailed studies of the spectral variations observed in a few objects provide valuable details of the physical conditions of the x  ray reprocessing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. ) and/or on the physical properties of absorbing material which may exist close to the central source ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "progress in settling alternative interpretations of the observed spectral variability can be made by correlating the spectral and timing properties in agn . along this line ,",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we studied 11 nearby , x  ray bright seyferts , which have been intensively observed over the last two decades by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "we detected a positive correlation between their mean spectral slope and the characteristic break frequency , @xmath7 , at which the power spectrum changes its slope from -1 to -2 . to the extent that this frequency corresponds to a ( still unknown ) characteristic time scale of the x  ray source",
    ", this correlation suggests that the mean x  ray spectral slope in agn is determined by a fundamental parameter of the system , most probably its accretion rate .",
    "if true , this result has important implications on current comptonization models .    in this work",
    "we use the results from the model fitting of thousands of _ rxte _ spectra of 10 agn that were included in the sample of @xcite .",
    "our prime goal is to study in detail the x  ray spectral variability of each object . although the spectral resolution of _ rxte _ is not as good as that of _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ or _ suzaku _ , the _ rxte _ data sets that we used are ideal for our purpose .",
    "first , the sources in the sample are nearby and x - ray bright . as a result",
    ", their x  ray spectral shape can be accurately determined even from relatively short ( @xmath012 ksec ) _ rxte _ observations .",
    "second , each source in the sample was observed regularly ( more than 200300 times , and in a few cases more than a thousand times ) over a long period of time ( of the order of 711 years ) .",
    "this is contrary to typical _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of individual agn , which usually span a period of a few days ( maximum ) .",
    "third , the characteristic frequencies of the objects imply time scales of the order of a few days or weeks .",
    "consequently , the _ rxte _ observations we have used most probably sample most of the flux and spectral variations that they exhibit .    a subsample of the observations we study have already been studied by @xcite .",
    "these authors used hardness ratios in various energy bands to study the spectral variability of four objects , namely ngc  5548 , ngc  5506 , ngc  4051 and mcg  -6 - 30 - 15 . in the present work we studied many more observations of these objects and",
    "we have also analysed data for six more seyferts .",
    "furthermore , instead of computing hardness ratios , we fitted each spectrum with the same phenomenological model of a  power law plus a gaussian line \" to derive the observed photon index , @xmath8 . in this way , we parametrized all available 320 kev _ rxte _ spectra of the sources in a uniform way .",
    "we then used the resulting best model fitting values to : i ) determine the mean spectral slope for each object and investigate its correlation with the main source parameters such as bh mass , accretion rate and luminosity , and ii ) construct their long term ",
    "spectral slope vs. flux \" relations .",
    "for the reasons explained above , we believe that we determined the flux related spectral variability in these sources more accurately than before .",
    "several possible reasons for the observed x  ray spectral variability in agn have been proposed in the past .",
    "the simplest possibility is that the @xmath8 variations correspond to intrinsic variations in continuum slope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite have showed that the x - ray spectral changes in ngc  7469 are intrinsic and respond to the uv - soft photon input variations , exactly as one would expect in the case of thermal comptonization models .",
    "however , there has also been certain observational evidence that the @xmath8 variations originate as a result of superposition of different spectral components with different variability properties .",
    "one such possibility is a spectrum composed of a constant reflection component and a variable , in normalization only , power - law like continuum of constant slope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "another possibility is a constant slope power law which varies in flux and complex variations in an absorber , e.g. its ionization state and/or the covering factor of the source ( see recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "one of our main result is that the x  ray spectral slope steepens with increasing flux in a _",
    "similar _ way for all the objects in the sample .",
    "this similarity implies that , although all the above mentioned mechanisms may operate in agn , it is just one of them which is mainly responsible for the observed spectral variability in agn .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we discuss the data selection and reduction , and we also describe the phenomenological models that we used to parametrize the shape of agn continuum . in section 3 , we report the spectral fitting results , and the results from the spectral variability study . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss our findings and compare them with predictions of several spectral variability models .",
    "we give our conclusions in section 5 .",

    "the main aim of this work was to determine the shape of the x  ray continuum , and study its variability , in 10 x  ray luminous agn which have been observed regularly with _",

    "we used a large number of spectra , which were taken regularly over a period of many years . as we argued in the introduction , since this time period is much larger than the characteristic time scale in these objects , it is possible that we have sampled the full range of their spectral variations .",

    "flux \" relation for the agn in the sample . in section 4.1",
    "we discuss the implications from the average  observed spectral slope - accretion rate \" correlation reported in section 3.1 .    in section 2.2.5",
    "we argued that despite the limited spectral resolution of the pca on board _ rxte _ , the @xmath8 values we derived from the model fitting of the individual spectra of each source are representative of their actual x ",
    "ray spectral shape .",
    "however , this conclusion does not necessarily imply that @xmath30 ( @xmath31 being the _ intrinsic _ slope of the x  ray continuum ) .",
    "due to the short exposure of the individual _ rxte _  observations and the limited resolution of the pca on board _ rxte _ , we can not constrain the properties of any warm absorbing material that may affect the spectra above 3 kev . consequently ,",
    "if there exists such a warm absorbing material in the vicinity of our x  ray sources , we would expect @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , the possible presence of a significant reflection component ( which we did not take into account in our models ) will also affect the observed x  ray spectral shape . as a result",
    ", we would expect again the spectral shape of the continuum to _ appear _ harder than it actually is , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "although all these mechanisms may operate in agn , one of our main results is that the  @xmath33flux \" relation is similar to all the objects in the sample , despite the fact that their bh mass and accretion rate are quite different .",
    "this common behaviour argues that their spectral variability is mainly driven by the same mechanism in all of them . in the following sections we demonstrate that , using various reasonable assumptions , the plots shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig7][fig : fig8 ] can be used to test various models for the agn spectral variability that have been proposed in the last few years .",
    "one of the main results of our study is that the agn in the sample do not have the same average spectral slope .",
    "instead we found that @xmath34 correlates positively with @xmath35 , that is agn with higher accretion rate show softer x - ray spectra as well .",
    "this is in agreement with recent studies which also suggested a positive correlation between spectral slope and accretion rate in agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and galactic black hole binaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gbhs ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the difference in the @xmath11 of the objects reflects a real difference in their intrinsic spectral slopes and it is not due to either the presence of a reflection component of different amplitude in the spectra of the sources or the effects of strong absorption in the 210 kev band .",
    "furthermore , the reality of the average  observed spectral slope ",
    "accretion rate \" correlation we observed can also be justified from its similarity with the  @xmath36accretion rate \" relation that has been observed in luminous quasars ( i.e. pg quasar luminosity and higher * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since the energy spectrum in such sources is not expected to be significantly affected by either absorption or reflection effects .",
    "we therefore believe that this correlation most probably reflects a  true / intrinsic \" correlation between the intrinsic spectral slope and accretion rate in agn .",
    "it is widely believed that hard x ",
    "rays from agn are produced by comptonization , i.e. by multiple up - scattering of seed soft photons by hot electrons in a corona located close to the black hole .",
    "the comptonization process generally produces power - law x  ray spectra . the main factor which determines the resulting x  ray spectrum is the so - called compton amplification factor , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the power dissipated in the corona and @xmath39 is the intercepted soft luminosity . according to @xcite and @xcite , @xmath40 , where @xmath412.30 , and @xmath420.10 in the case of agn ,",
    "in which the energy of the input soft photons is of the order of a few evs .    if hard x ",
    "rays from agn are indeed generated by the comptonization process , then a possible explanation for the  spectral slope - accretion rate \" correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]c is that the ratio @xmath43 in these objects decreases proportionally with increasing accretion rate . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath44 , then the @xmath45 relation implies that @xmath46 , with @xmath420.1 , as observed .",
    "the ratio @xmath43 depends mostly on the geometry of the accretion flow , and the geometry may depend on the accretion rate .",
    "one possibility is that the cold disc is disrupted in the inner region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as @xmath47 increases",
    ", the inner radius of the disc may approach the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit , and so more soft photons are supplied to the hot inner flow causing an increase in @xmath48 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath43 should decrease and the x - ray spectrum should soften accordingly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this case , we will have to accept that the inner radius of the disc in agn has not reached the innermost radius of the last circular stable orbit , even in the case of objects such as ark  564 which probably accretes at almost its eddington limit .",
    "another possibility is that the coronal plasma is moving away from the disc and emits beamed x ",
    "rays @xcite . in this case , the compton amplification factor depends on the plasma velocity , @xmath49 . as this velocity increases , @xmath50 should also increase and the spectrum should harden .",
    "if this picture is correct , then our results imply that the plasma velocity should decrease with increasing accretion rate , which is somewhat opposite to what one would expect . furthermore ,",
    "if the x - rays are beamed away from the disc , one would expect the ew of the iron line to decrease with increasing plasma velocity as well .",
    "hence , one would expect the ew to increase with increasing accretion rate .",
    "however , we do not observe a significant correlation between the line s ew and accretion rate for the objects in the sample .",
    "the  observed spectral slope ",
    "accretion rate \" relation could also be explained , quantitatively , if we assume that either the amount of reflection decreases or the effects of absorption become weaker as the accretion rate increases . in the first case",
    ", we should also expect to detect an anti - correlation between @xmath51 and accretion rate , which is not the case . in the second case ,",
    "if the warm absorber is located far away from the central source and the weakening of the absorption is due to the decrease in its opacity , by increasing its ionization parameter for example , we should expect @xmath11 to correlate with the source luminosity , which is not the case .",
    "it is more difficult to anticipate the  observed spectral slope ",
    "accretion rate \" relation in the case when the absorber originates from an outflowing disc wind .",
    "the reason is that no physical models predict at the moment how does the accretion rate control the mass loss rate and the ionization state of the wind , and hence its opacity .",
    "one possible explanation for the  observed spectral slope ",
    "flux \" relations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] is that the observed flux variations correspond to @xmath47 variations in each source .",

    "similarly , this factor may vary with @xmath47 also in individual objects , iin which case we would expect @xmath52 , where @xmath530.1 ( see discussion in the previous section ) .",

    "we considered next the possibility that the x  ray continuum in agn consists of a constant reflection component and a power - law continuum with variable n@xmath72 _ and _ @xmath31 .",
    "this is a combination of the two cases we considered above : x  rays are produced by thermal comptonization , the flux variations ( i.e. the n@xmath64 variations ) reflect intrinsic variations in the accretion rate , and @xmath116 ( this is the best power - law model fit to the @xmath117 relation plotted in fig .

    "the x  ray source illuminates a reflecting material , which effectively responds to the average x  ray continuum ( i.e. to a power - law of @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) .",
    "this could be for example the case of a reflector which is located away from the x  ray source .    to investigate this possibility",
    ", we considered again the model pexriv+powerlaw in xspec .",
    "this time , we created model spectra assuming 8 values of the power law normalization ( from @xmath120 up to 0.1 ) and a spectral slope of @xmath121n@xmath122 ( the arbitrary choice @xmath123n@xmath64 was made for simplicity ; it does not affect our results , as long as the resulting model curves are allowed to shift freely along the @xmath124axis when we fit them to the data ) .",
    "then , for each pair of values ( n@xmath125 we considered the respective reflection component ( from neutral material ) in the case when @xmath81 , and we added it to all 8 power - law spectra . in this way , we constructed 8 sets of model curves ( 8 model spectra in each set ) .",

    "we fitted the 8  @xmath8  @xmath10 \" model curves to the observed  spectral slope  luminosity \" relations plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] by allowing them to shift both in the vertical ( i.e. @xmath127 ) , and the horizontal direction ( i.e. @xmath128 ) .",

    "interestingly , the model fits well the ngc  3227 data , a result which implies that the flat @xmath8 at low fluxes may correspond to intrinsically flatter spectra , and not an increase in the external absorption by cold gas . in the case of ngc  4051 ,",
    "the fit is not statistically acceptable ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) mainly because of the lowest flux point .",
    "furthermore , the model fails entirely to describe the ngc  5548 data .",
    "this result is obvious given the fact that the model curves in this case have no flat part that could fit , even approximately , the observed ngc  5548 data .    in principle , we should not allow a @xmath93axis shift of the model curves in this case .",
    "the intrinsic spectral slope is uniquely determined by the @xmath132n@xmath64 relation we assumed .",
    "however , the assumed relation was determined by the pl model fit to the  average spectral slope - average accretion rate \" data plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]c , hence there is an uncertainty associated with its normalization and slope .",
    "the average best fit @xmath93axis shift for all objects is 0.13@xmath133 , i.e. it is consistent with zero .",
    "this result implies that the relation @xmath134 is in agreement with both the average  spectral slope - accretion rate \" relation of all objects and with the individual  slope - luminosity \" relations of each agn .    the ark  564 data are fitted best in the case when the constant reflection component is the one which corresponds to @xmath135 .",
    "the mrk  766 and ngc  4051 data are fitted best in the case of constant reflection component for @xmath136 and 1.9 , respectively . in all other cases , the addition of a constant component for @xmath137 is needed to fit the data best .",
    "we analyzed more than 7,500 _ rxte _",
    "pca data of 10 nearby agn with the goal of studying their spectral variability properties . the objects were observed regularly with _ rxte _  over many years since 1996 .",
    "given the large number of observations , spread over many years , we were able to determine accurately their average observed spectral slope , luminosity and accretion rate . using the best model - fit results from the hundreds of spectra of each source",
    ", we also determined their long - term `` observed spectral slope  x  ray flux '' relation .",
    "this kind of long term variability analysis can not be accomplished with the rather short agn observations currently performed by _",
    "chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ or _ suzaku _ , despite their higher effective area and superior spectral resolution .",
    "our main results are as follows :    = 0em=0.5em    the average spectral slope is _ not _ the same in all objects . it does not correlate either with bh mass or luminosity .",
    "however , @xmath138 correlates positively with the mass accretion rate : objects with higher accretion rate have steeper spectra , and @xmath139 .",
    "this result can be explained if the compton amplification factor , @xmath50 , decreases proportionally with the accretion rate in agn .",
    "we detected the iron k@xmath1 line in many spectra of seven sources in the sample .",
    "the average ew of the line anti - correlates with the average 210 kev luminosity ( i.e. the so - called iwasawa - taniguchi effect ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with recent results which are based on recent studies of large samples of agn @xcite .",
    "the spectra of each source become steeper with increasing flux .",
    "this is a well known result .",
    "what we have shown in this work that this trend holds over many years , and over almost the full range of flux variations that agn exhibit .",
    "we also found that the @xmath14 relations are _ similar _ in all objects , except for ngc  5548 .",
    "there are many reasons which can cause apparent and/or intrinsic variations in the x  ray spectrum of agn .",
    "it is possible that they all operate , to a different extent in various objects .",
    "however , the common spectral variability pattern we detected implies that just a single mechanism is responsible for the bulk of the observed spectral variations .    ngc  5548 displays limited spectral variations for its flux variability .",
    "although uncommon , this behaviour has also been observed in other type i seyfert , pg 0804 + 761 @xcite .",
    "this behaviour , different to what is observed in most ( type i ) agn , raises the issue of different spectral states in agn , just like in gbhs .",
    "investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the scenario in which the spectral variability is caused by absorption of x - rays by a _ single _",
    "medium whose ionization parameter varies proportionally to the continuum flux variations fails to account for the observed spectral variations .",
    "a  power - law , with constant @xmath31 and variable flux , plus a constant reflection component \" can fit the observed `` @xmath140 '' relations of most ( but not all ) objects in the sample .",
    "the flux of the reflection component necessary to explain the observed spectral variability is rather large , implying average reflection amplitudes of the order of @xmath115 .",
    "if true , this result implies that the primary source of x - rays is located close to a maximally rotating kerr black hole , where relativistic effects ( such as light bending ) are expected to be strong .",
    "the observed `` @xmath141 '' relations ( except for ngc  5548 ) can be explained if we assume that the power - law continuum varies both in flux and shape as @xmath142 ( as implied by the _",
    "average _  spectral slope - accretion rate \" relation that we observed ) _ and _ the reflecting material responds to the average continuum spectrum , with @xmath81 .",
