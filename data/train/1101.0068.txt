    "ou - type processes could be replaced by fractional ou - type processes ( see @xcite or @xcite , for instance ) to have long memory effects included in the model . however , in this case many desirable properties are lost , and , in particular , fractional ou - type processes no longer have jumps .",
    "an alternative to obtain long memory from ou - type processes and still to have jumps is to add up countably many independent ou - type processes , that is , @xmath8 with independent identically distributed lvy processes @xmath9 and appropriate @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "intuitively we can likewise `` add ''",
    "( i.e. , integrate ) up independent ou - type processes with all parameter values @xmath3 possible .",
    "the resulting processes are called supou processes and have been introduced in @xcite where it has also been established that they may exhibit long - range dependence . for a comprehensive treatment regarding the theory and use of univariate supou processes in finance",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "so far supou processes have only been considered in the univariate case . however , in many applications it is crucial to model several time series with a joint model , and so flexible multivariate models are important .",

    "our theory is not a straightforward extension of the univariate results .",

    "it turns out later on that the behavior of supou becomes more tractable when we restrict @xmath15 to come only from a nice subset , like the negative definite matrices .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the next section starts with a brief overview of important notation and conventions used in the paper and is followed in section [ sec:21 ] by a comprehensive introduction into lvy bases and the related integration theory , which will be needed to define supou processes . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we first define multivariate supou processes and provide existence conditions in section [ sec:31 ] .",
    "thereafter , we discuss the existence of moments and derive the second - order structure . for the finite variation case",
    "we show important path properties in section [ sec:33 ] . besides establishing that we have cdlg paths of bounded variation",

    "we use our results to define positive semi - definite supou processes and analyze their properties .",

    "based on the previous section we now consider supou processes which are positive semi - definite at all times .",
    "the importance of such processes is that they can be used to describe the random evolution of a latent covariance matrix over time and , hence , they can be used in multivariate models for heteroskedastic data , for example , the stochastic volatility model of @xcite .",

    "examples [ ex31][ex5 ] can all be immediately adapted to the positive semi - definite set - up . more examples in connection with stochastic volatility modeling",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss possible applications for our model and the relevance of our results for them .",
    "some of these applications are already developed further in other work .      in many areas of applications ( e.g. , telecommunication , hydrology , economics , finance ) one",
    "is confronted with time series exhibiting a long memory behavior ( see @xcite , for instance ) or at least a decay of the autocovariance appearing to be a polynomial decay rather than the exponential as typically encountered in models of markovian nature . moreover , often the relevant data series are multidimensional , and multivariate models are needed in order to understand and adequately model the dependence effects of the observed data . for irregularly - spaced or high - frequency data as well as when intending to look at the data at more than one frequency , it is often advisable not to use discrete - time models ( like ar(fi)ma , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but continuous - time models .",
    "such models can exhibit both continuous and discontinuous sample paths . among the ones with continuous sample paths are continuous - time counterparts of arfima , like ficarma ( see @xcite ) , which also exhibit long memory .",
    "often it is , however , appropriate to use models with discontinuous sample paths . in such situations",
    "it appears adequate to use multivariate supou processes .",
    "it should be noted that the individual autocovariances of multivariate supou processes do not necessarily have to decay monotonically like in the univariate case , but may exhibit damped sinusoidal - like and comparable behavior due to the involved matrix exponentials .",
    "hence , one can reproduce second - order moment behavior which in the univariate case calls for the use of @xmath565-based models .",
    "as for all such models it is a delicate issue to estimate multivariate supou processes from observed data , and this poses many challenging questions .",
    "our calculation of the second - order moment structure clearly opens the door for ( general ) method - of - moments - based techniques .",
    "let us illustrate this in a simple example .",
    "consider the set - up of example [ ex31 ] with @xmath71 restricted to have only real eigenvalues .",
    "note that in this set - up the parameters can not be identified , because replacing @xmath566 by @xmath567 and @xmath71 by @xmath568 leaves the law of the lvy basis invariant for any @xmath304 .",
    "so we assume @xmath569 without loss of generality . recall that @xmath570 with @xmath571 . assuming that @xmath572 is invertible we can define @xmath573 which has eigenvalues of the form @xmath574 with @xmath575 .",
    "so we can obtain an estimator @xmath576 by calculating the empirical autocovariance function from data and fitting @xmath147 to the maximum ( or any other ) eigenvalue of @xmath577 for @xmath578 with @xmath579 and @xmath580 being the distance between subsequent observations ( assumed to be constant ) by nonlinear least squares , for instance .",
    "thereafter , we can get an estimator for @xmath71 by @xmath581 .",
    "now it is straightforward to also get estimators for @xmath582 and @xmath572 from the empirical mean and variance .",
    "one thus obtains the first two moments of the underlying lvy process . if we restrict the allowed lvy bases such that the first two moments of the underlying lvy process identify the parameters @xmath583 , we have thus obtained a procedure to estimate all parameters of our model .    to prove consistency and asymptotic normality ( or other asymptotic distributions in the case of true long memory ) of the estimators one obviously needs to understand the ( highly non - markovian ) dependence structure of our processes and establish mixing conditions or appropriate substitutes .",
    "we hope to address this issue in future work .    in a set - up like in example [ ex34 ]",
    "the estimation becomes much easier because all parameters except the ones describing the dependence between the components can be inferred from the univariate marginal distributions and the univariate moment structure .",
    "in particular , the parameters @xmath584 and @xmath585 can be estimated from the autocovariances of the individual one - dimensional series ; hence , one does not have to compute eigenvalues or matrix powers as above .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in theorem [ th : supouex ] or formula we have given formulae for the characteristic function of multivariate supou processes .",
    "hence , one can also use estimation techniques based on the empirical characteristic function .",
    "this is obviously best done in cases where the driving lvy basis is chosen such that the integrals in theorem [ th : supouex ] or formula can be calculated analytically . moreover , these formulae can be used to calculate higher order cumulants for the methods of moments based estimation .",
    "lvy - based stochastic volatility models are very successfully applied in both financial mathematics and financial econometrics , since they capture many of the stylized facts ( nonconstant , stochastic volatility exhibiting jumps , heavy tails , volatility clustering , leverage effect@xmath586 see , e.g. , @xcite ) of financial returns very well .",
    "one model often employed is the ornstein  uhlenbeck - type stochastic volatility model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the use of supou processes as the volatility process , that is , the process modelling the instantaneous ( co)variance , allows one to introduce also long memory , which is another important stylized fact , but not covered by most models , into the model .",
    "let us illustrate this in a simple set - up .",
    "let @xmath529 be a positive semi - definite supou process as introduced in section [ sec:4 ] and satisfying the conditions of theorem [ th : pathproppd](ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "then the log - returns of @xmath13 financial assets ( stocks or currencies , for instance ) are given by @xmath587 with @xmath588 , initial log prices @xmath589 independent of @xmath111 , @xmath590 a linear operator and @xmath1 being the underlying lvy process .",
    "it should be noted that in this model jumps in the price and the volatility always occur together which is reasonable for financial data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an extension of the above model has been investigated in - depth in @xcite where it is , in particular , shown that long memory in @xmath529 causes long - range dependence in @xmath591 and explicit formulae for the moment structure of the ( squared ) returns are obtained .",
    "this allows an in - depth econometric analysis and estimation of the supou stochastic volatility model comparable to what has been done in @xcite for the multivariate ou - type stochastic volatility model , where it was shown that that model can be estimated and fits well to observed data , both from the stock and foreign exchange markets .    in financial mathematics",
    "one is often interested in calculating prices of derivatives from a given model and in determining the parameters from option prices observed on the markets , referred to as calibration . in most reasonably realistic models , unlike the black  scholes model , one can not obtain closed - form formulae for the prices of derivatives . however , calculating prices via monte carlo simulations is typically too time consuming .",
    "whenever possible , better techniques to calculate derivative prices , that is , conditional expectations of future payoffs , are called for .",
    "one technique which proved to be very adequate in many situations is the calculation of the prices by inverting the laplace transform ( see @xcite ) . for the multivariate ou model this technique",
    "is successfully applied in @xcite .",
    "also , in the above given model one can calculate the conditional fourier transform of the future prices . since some complex values will arise , one has to be careful with the scalar products .",
    "we use the scalar product @xmath592 on @xmath73 and @xmath593 on @xmath406 denoting by @xmath594 the hermitian and by @xmath519 the trace of a matrix . for a linear operator @xmath595",
    "also denotes the adjoint operator in the following .",

    "however , since this results in rather lengthy formulae , especially in the part coming from the lvy measure , we refrain from giving further details .",
    "note that we only condition on @xmath589 , since @xmath609 is highly non - markovian and , hence , not informative regarding future values of @xmath529 , and that equation is essential to obtain .",

    "unfortunately , it seems extremely hard to understand what happens if one conditions on all these historic prices .",
    "another point of view would be to say that @xmath50 and @xmath111 resemble the information arriving at the markets and that market participants observe all this information precisely . in that case",
