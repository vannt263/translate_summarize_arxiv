    "gaining an understanding of the inhomogeneous stress distribution in a granular packing is important both because of the insight it may yield into failure mechanisms and as a first step towards elucidating the dynamics of such systems  @xcite .",
    "although qualitative aspects of the inhomogeneities have been known for some time  @xcite , quantitative experiments have been performed only recently for cylindrical packings of glass beads  @xcite , 2d arrangements of optical fibers  @xcite , and shear cells of glass spheres  @xcite .",
    "these experiments , together with numerical simulations  @xcite , have yielded new insight into the nature of stress inhomogeneities .",

    ", the disorder in the system leading to the creation of force chains , whether from the inhomogeneities in the packing itself , variations in the size of the particles , or differences in material properties , is encapsulated in a set of random variables labeled @xmath3 which determine the fraction of the stress component is transferred from an element @xmath4 of the packing to a neighboring element @xmath5 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "these fractions are chosen randomly from probability distributions consistent with the constraint of force balance with the assumption that the @xmath0 s at different sites are uncorrelated .",
    "correlated @xmath0 models have also been investigated  @xcite .",
    "the layer - by - layer structure enables analytic progress on characterizing the force distributions .",
    "the predicted exponential decay in the probability distribution for large values of the stress component is in qualitative agreement with experimental and simulation results .",
    "the @xmath0 model is scalar : it ignores the contributions that balancing the remaining stress components and torque may have in determining the weight redistribution and yields no information on their probability distributions .",
    "investigation of correlations between fluctuations of shear and of compression effects , processes which are important in understanding failure , are not possible with this model . moreover , though the @xmath0 model successfully describes the stress fluctuations in simple geometries where the large - scale stresses are spatially constant , if applied to situations where stress varies over long scales , it predicts that these variations should obey a diffusion equation , in disagreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "these shortcomings have led several groups to examine stress fluctuations in models which incorporate vector forces  @xcite .",

    "they interpret this result , quite reasonably , as indicating that the granular material must rearrange .",
    "however , the materials should eventually reach a state at which the load should be supported and all the forces non - tensile .",

    "generalization of the lattice - based models provides another means of approaching the issue .",

    ", we see the possibility of the creation of large - magnitude horizontal output forces that are independent of the input forces and torque .",
    "the layer - by - layer structure does not allow for an intrinsic mechanism of removal , leading the most natural formulations of the model to have horizontal forces that appear to grow without bound as the system depth is increased .",
    "incorporating cutoffs on the force magnitudes appears necessary to achieve any set of reasonable force redistributions .",
    "we find the probability distributions of vertical forces are insensitive to the cutoffs while the probability distribution of horizontal forces are dependent on their form .",

    "as in the scalar version of the @xmath0 model  @xcite , we assume that the essential features of the disorder in a granular packing can be described using random variables .",
    "the choice of these variables is constrained by the requirements of satisfying force and torque balance as well as the requirement that the forces be non - tensile .",
    "we describe below the specific representation of random variables that we have employed . for the model to be considered useful",
    ", the probability distributions of vertical and horizontal force components should not be sensitive to the details of these choices .    in our implementation of a layer - by - layer vector model",
    "we assume the topology of the packing is that of a modified regular two - dimensional triangular lattice of discs , as shown in figure [ fig : lattice ] .",
    "forces are introduced at the top of the lattice and are propagated downwards with `` input '' forces at a site arising from the two neighbors in the layer above and the resulting `` output '' forces being passed on to the two neighbors below .",

    "we have chosen to parameterize the redistribution of forces at a site by randomly chosen contact angles and effective friction coefficients .",
    "figure [ fig : site ] shows a schematic of the forces acting on a site .",
    "the contact angles @xmath12 determine the direction of the output normal forces @xmath13 to the left and right neighbors , respectively , and are chosen from the interval @xmath14 .",

    "one possibility is that the input forces and torque may be such that no valid redistribution can occur .",
    "although the force and torque balance equations always yield solutions for the inputs in any randomly chosen configuration of angles and friction , the additional non - tensile and frictional constraints may severely limit the number that may be realized .",
    "typically , we see that the configuration space is significantly reduced if the net input force is largely horizontal or if the input torque is large relative to the input normal and frictional forces .    a more serious difficulty arises because large magnitude output forces can be generated irrespective of the magnitude of the input force . to illustrate this problem",

    "@xmath38 depends only on the choice of random variables and is independent of the input force .    exactly at the @xmath42 boundary , the output forces sum vectorially to zero no force balance is possible .",
    "this boundary occurs at values of @xmath12 and @xmath43 satisfying @xmath44 the boundary can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : configuration](a ) . although the boundary itself does not yield solutions , regions of configuration space exist near it that do yield valid solutions for which @xmath45 is very small . in these regions",
    "the output forces almost cancel , requiring large magnitude normal forces in order to satisfy any equilibrium condition for non - zero input values .",
    "because the input force is designated as originating from the neighboring sites from the layer above , an asymmetry exists between vertical and horizontal components .",
    "the vertical components of the output forces are bounded in magnitude by the fixed vertical component of the input while the horizontal components of the leftward and rightward outputs acting in opposition to each other are essentially unbounded .",
    "this effect can easily be seen in the non - frictional case for a purely vertical input force : as shown in figure  [ fig : large_mag ] , as the angle of both output forces approach the horizontal , the magnitude of those forces must increase so that their vertical components will balance the input .",
    "the frictional case is similar , though the addition of tangential forces complicates the picture slightly .",
    "the vector model proposed by eloy and clment  @xcite also suffers from this pathology although the mechanism may not be as obvious due to their choice of parameterization .",
    "socolar s model  @xcite requires the forces to lie in a @xmath46 cone about the vertical and therefore only considers non - negative values of friction ( as interpreted by our model ) . as a result",
    ", it does not generate these large forces but at the cost of imposing severe limits on the magnitude of horizontal components .",
    "we discuss this issue in more detail below .",
    "our algorithm for generating large lattices redistributes the forces at individual sites starting from a normally distributed vertical load applied on the top layer of sites and proceeding downward into the lattice layer by layer .",
    "all sites on a layer are processed before proceeding to the next layer down .",
    "contact angles @xmath12 and an effective friction coefficient , either @xmath28 or @xmath29 , at a site are randomly chosen within their respective intervals using a uniform deviate and a test is made to determine whether the resulting force redistribution satisfies the necessary non - tensile and frictional constraints . if the constraints are not met , new sets of random variables for the site are chosen until all requirements are satisfied .",
    "failure in lattice generation occurs when the input forces and torque at a site can not be be redistributed within a reasonable sampling of the contact angles - effective friction coefficient configuration space .",
    "reasonable has been defined as a sampling of 25,000 uniformly distributed points in the space .",
    "a larger sampling size did not increase the lattice yield significantly .",
    "furthermore , some input force configurations do not have any valid redistributions . in our simulation , if no valid redistribution for a site is found , lattice generation is terminated and restarted with another random number seed . while encountered mainly when friction has been applied , we find that non - frictional cases may also suffer from this behavior",
    ". the rate of failure increases with lattice size and coefficient of static friction @xmath6 .",
    "however , techniques described in appendix  [ app : pfb ] can be used to increase the yield .",
    "as discussed above , large horizontal forces can be generated at a single site .",
    "however , we consider the possibility that the lattice structure may be self - limiting so that the effect of large magnitude horizontal forces will be restricted to small neighborhoods surrounding the generating site . one possible mechanism would be the cancellation occurring at a site with left and right input neighbors both contributing this type of force .",
    "however , as shown below , we find that the generation of a cancellation pair is unlikely enough that these large forces build up and propagate in our lattices .",
    "having failed to identify an intrinsic means to limit the production and transmission of large magnitude horizontal forces , we impose various cutoff schemes to attempt to generate sets of realistic force distributions .",
    "the choice of one form of implementation over another is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "consequently , several cutoff schemes have been implemented to observe the influence they exert on the resulting force distributions .",
    "the first cutoff scheme we implement is the simplest : the magnitude of each normal force at a site may not exceed a specified value .",
    "the second scheme is to limit the allowed angles to prevent exploration of the @xmath47 boundary .",
    "this method is similar to the eloy and clment model  @xcite which has fixed angles . by restricting the range of available angles , this type of limit serves to reduce the volume of configuration space available for redistribution and can exclude regions that form large magnitude horizontal forces .",
    "our third scheme is a soft cutoff scheme based on the assumption of contact energies between sites following a boltzmann - like distribution .",
    "this choice is clearly arbitrary as the system is not thermal . for simplicity",
    ", the lattice is modeled as a layer of spheres whose centers lie on the same plane ( contact topology is therefore equivalent to discs ) and elastic theory  @xcite is used to calculate the energy @xmath48 within the contacts between these spheres : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the normal force between the sites in contact and @xmath51 is a function of the material properties ( poisson s ratio @xmath52 and young s modulus @xmath53 ) and radius @xmath24 of the spheres .",
    "we assume that the probability that a contact has an energy @xmath48 follows an exponential distribution @xmath54 where @xmath55 is is an arbitrarily assigned average contact energy .      for each coefficient of friction @xmath6 and",

    "the load is distributed on the top layer via a normal distribution centered about the average force of 10 n with a standard deviation of 5 n. normalization of both the vertical and horizontal force components is performed relative to the average vertical force ( 10 n ) imposed on a site by the load on the system .",
    "the lattice size is chosen to minimize computational time as the failure rate ( number of lattices which failed to run to completion divided by number of lattices started ) in lattice generation grew significantly with increased vertical size despite the measures taken to increase overall yield described in appendix  [ app : pfb ] . however , as convergence of the distributions proves to be fairly rapid , larger lattices are unnecessary .",
    "data sets with static coefficients of friction @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 under various cutoff schemes are used .",
    "configurations for @xmath59 and @xmath58 are also generated without an applied force cutoff in order to demonstrate the necessity of cutoff implementation . in setting the sharp force cutoff , upper limits of 50 n and",

    "total input energies of 1 and 5 j are considered , leading to @xmath64 j and @xmath65 j , respectively .",
    "we find the probability distribution @xmath66 of normalized vertical forces @xmath67 shows remarkable robustness and appears to be independent of the coefficient of friction @xmath6 and of choices of large force cutoff . in contrast , the probability distribution @xmath68 of normalized horizontal forces @xmath69 exhibits changes in functional form with variation in both @xmath6 and with cutoff choice .",
    "horizontal forces , in general , are of larger magnitude than vertical forces .    convergence of the probability distributions of normalized vertical force component @xmath67 is fairly rapid , on the order of 10 rows . @xmath66 versus depth in lattice is shown in figure [ fig : vertical](a ) for a non - frictional , sharp cutoff limit configuration .",
    "similar results for @xmath66 are seen for all generated configurations with little variation in functional form ; the distributions at row 100 are shown in figure [ fig : vertical](b ) with the symbol key for the various configurations shown in table [ tbl : symbol ] . an exponential tail for @xmath66",
    "is seen for larger values of @xmath67 and a `` dip '' in @xmath66 is seen for small values of @xmath67 .",
    "the observed @xmath66 is very similar to that obtained from the scalar @xmath0 model with uniform @xmath0 distribution for an @xmath70 ( two - dimensional ) system  @xcite @xmath71 the distributions of @xmath0 values describing the redistribution of the vertical forces , shown in figure [ fig : q ] , are nearly uniform with a slight increase in probability near values of 0 and 1 as compared to 0.5 for @xmath56 and a decrease when @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , configurations with @xmath72 in the vector model do allow for @xmath0 values outside the range @xmath73 $ ] due to mostly horizontal normal forces with a corresponding @xmath74 .",
    "the net vertical component of the input force at a site is still kept positive . for the @xmath75 configurations examined , roughly 5 - 20% of the @xmath0 values",
    "are found to lie outside the range @xmath73 $ ] with a smaller fraction found in more restrictive force cutoff configurations and a larger fraction for less restrictive cutoffs .",
    "non - frictional @xmath76 configurations all have @xmath0 values lying in the range @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "in contrast to the vertical force distribution @xmath66 , the probability distribution @xmath68 of normalized horizontal force component @xmath69 shows great variation in form with changes in the imposed force limit .",
    "we first examine the @xmath68 distributions for lattice sets with no imposed force cutoff and @xmath59 and @xmath58 , shown in figure [ fig : nightmare ] .",
    "we see the distributions spreading toward larger values of @xmath69 as we progress deeper into the lattice while @xmath66 remains bounded and robust .",
    "when @xmath56 , @xmath68 converges , but at values of the horizontal force much greater than the vertical force , as seen in [ fig : nightmare](a ) .",
    "we find that this convergence is mainly to a decrease in the number of valid solutions of force and torque balance , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : balance ] ) , that satisfy the non - tensile and frictional constraints given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : constraints ] ) as the ratio of input force components @xmath77 grows larger .",
    "although this process appears to provide an intrinsic limit on forces , it results in physically unreasonable values of force and fails altogether to limit the magnitude of horizontal forces when @xmath72 .",
    "the addition of friction greatly enhances the anisotropy the generation of large horizontal forces in configurations without friction only occurs at nearly horizontal values of @xmath12 , while the addition of friction allows for the generation to occur for a larger region of angles .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath42 boundary for @xmath56 occurs only at @xmath78 while it varies for @xmath79 according to @xmath80 the rapid growth in the magnitude of @xmath69 values prevents the generation of large frictional lattices without imposed force cutoffs to take place in a reasonable amount of time . when a sharp cutoff in the normal force is imposed , the probability distribution p(h ) , as seen in figure [ fig : horizontal](a ) cuts off abruptly , which is unlikely to be realized in a physical packing .",
    "the use of angle cutoffs was unsatisfactory as lattice generation for this scheme was consistently terminated due to angles being driven to the cutoff values due to our choice of parameterization and random value selection .",
    "configurations obtained using the soft cutoff from eq .",
    "( [ eq : soft ] ) , shown in figure [ fig : horizontal](b ) , exhibit differing functional forms for the probability distribution as the cutoff is changed with broadening occurring at the tail with increased input energy . for small values of @xmath69 , the distribution appears to be unaffected by changes in the choice of cutoff .",
    "increasing @xmath6 serves to broaden the distribution @xmath68 .",
    "as force components are normalized by the same factor , it can be readily seen that the scale of horizontal forces is larger than the vertical as shown in the inset of [ fig : horizontal](a ) . a grayscale plot of the forces on a representative sample lattice with @xmath79 and a sharp cutoff at 100 n is shown in figure [ fig : sample.lattice ] .",
    "it is obvious that the vertical and horizontal force fluctuations differ qualitatively .",
    "thus , although the imposition of force limits results in horizontal force distributions which do not diverge as the depth is increased , these limits serve only to mask the divergent behavior of the model : the distribution of forces expands to fill the space allowed and the distribution of horizontal forces exhibits a strong dependence on the choice of cutoff scheme and value .",
    "the layer - by - layer vector model that we have investigated to model forces in granular packings yields vertical and horizontal force probability distributions which are of different functional forms and scales , in contrast with the recent measurements by mueth _",
    "et al . _",
    "moreover , while the distribution of vertical forces is robust , the distribution of horizontal forces depends on the details of our implementation .",
    "the asymmetry seen in the force distributions is a reflection of the vertical - horizontal asymmetry inherent in any uni - directional layer - by - layer model . at the level of individual elements",
    ", we see that large - magnitude horizontal forces are generated . as these forces accumulate , the resulting probability distribution of horizontal force components is naturally skewed toward larger values .",
    "in contrast , large vertical forces are not generated .",
    "the imposition of limits on the vertical forces by the applied load and the non - tensile force constraint is sufficient to limit the magnitude of that force component .",
    "the horizontal component has no similar constraints except those arbitrarily imposed by our cutoff schemes .",
    "this behavior is apparent in other implementations of layer - by - layer models despite differing choices in parameterization and configuration .",
    "eloy and clment  @xcite model the packing by assuming a mono - disperse 2d array of hard cylinders arranged in a triangular lattice .",
    "the angle of contact between cylinders in neighboring layers is fixed at slightly less than @xmath60 measured with respect to the horizontal .",
    "the redistribution of forces at a cylinder is parameterized by the coefficient of friction @xmath6 and the difference in value of the horizontal force components transfered to the neighboring sites in the row below , @xmath81 .",
    "they clearly note that for certain values of @xmath6 , valid values of @xmath81 are unreasonably large in magnitude and an arbitrary cutoff , restricting the parameter space to be far away from this divergent region , is imposed .",
    "socolar s @xmath82 model  @xcite represents the packing with a lattice of square cells with net normal forces , couples ( torques ) , and tangential forces represented on each edge .",
    "the redistribution of forces at a cell is parameterized by a triplet of values @xmath83 which are used to couple the torque and force balance .",
    "the distribution of net forces at every site is restricted to be in a downward cone opening at @xmath46 by considering only frictional forces acting in conjunction ( the same direction vertically ) with normal forces .",
    "this restriction guarantees successful lattice generation but renders the force fluctuations anisotropic by construction the magnitude of the horizontal force components is artificially limited to less than that of the vertical .",
    "we believe that widening the cone by including frictional forces in opposition to normal forces would lead to the divergent behavior of horizontal force components .",
    "transmission of information regarding the production of large - magnitude forces upwards into the already processed portion of the lattice is a mechanism missing in layer - by - layer models which could serve as means of suppressing large magnitude forces . to illustrate this point ,",
    "figure  [ fig : feedback ] shows the breakup of a large horizontal force into upward- and downward - traveling components .",
    "in addition to reducing the magnitude of a single force which would have otherwise persisted , this process yields an upward force component that may instigate a rearrangement which then causes a new redistribution of forces in the layers above and allow the site generating the force to `` relax '' to a less stressful configuration or generate a loop which isolates the force chain .",
    "one must consider some sort of feedback mechanism to enable corrective rearrangements and redistribution of forces to be made .    implementation of a feedback mechanism within the context of a layer - by - layer method is not a trivial matter . while a pseudo - feedback mechanism ( see appendix [ app : pfb ] ) is used in the generation of the sets of lattices analyzed here and serves the purpose of increasing the likelihood of finding an allowable configuration , it still maintains the downward propagation of actual force information .    in summary , the intrinsic asymmetry of layer - by - layer vector models results in asymmetries in force distributions that are not seen in experiment .",
    "this failure of the model indicates that constructing a statistical characterization of vector force transmission in granular media requires a better understanding of the vectorial nature of force redistribution , taking into account explicitly the symmetry properties of the medium .",
    "this work was supported primarily by the mrsec program of the national science foundation under award number dmr 9400379 .",
    "we are grateful to d. mueth , s. nagel , h. jaeger , r. clelland , f. radjai , and j. socolar for useful conversations .",
    "the generation of a sufficiently large set of lattices is essential in performing any reasonable statistical analysis of the force distribution in the model . in the @xmath0 model ,",
    "valid redistribution of force at a site is guaranteed because the constraints on the choices of @xmath0 s are independent of the force acting at a given site . in the vector model proposed here , as well as in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the set of random statistical variables allowed at a site is dependent on the force acting upon it , as can be seen by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : forces ] ) and ( [ eq : constraints ] ) for calculating the output normal forces and checking the non - tensile constraint , respectively .",
    "we choose to select the set of random statistical variables for a site , test to see if the constraints are met , and discard and reselect a new set of variables if the constraints are not satisfied . although seemingly inefficient , this method is far simpler than encapsulating the non - tensile and friction constraints within the choice of random variables .",
    "the lack of a guaranteed redistribution configuration is the root cause of the failure in lattice generation in the vector models we examined .",
    "we may reduce the rate of incidence of failure if we can ensure that the inputs at the sites in the layer below that currently being redistributed will be able to support valid force redistributions themselves .",
    "we do this by incorporating a simple check in the selection process for the statistical variables @xmath12 and @xmath15 for neighboring sites in the same layer .",
    "if a valid redistribution is not possible , then all sites on the row are subjected to a new redistribution",
    ". we may extend this process to an arbitrary number of resulting layers although this may significantly increase the memory requirements for computation in addition to complicating the layer - by - layer algorithm .",
    "the essence of this requirement is to capture the flavor of feedback and rearrangement , albeit in an imprecise manner .",
    "however , we have no guarantees that a valid configuration will be possible .",
    "this pseudo - feedback ( pfb ) addition was set to a depth of two layers in the process of generating the lattices used in this paper .",
    "typically , most difficulties in redistribution may be resolved with a one - layer pfb as this provides an immediate check for input forces leading to a valid redistribution .",
    "however , these valid redistributions may lead to an invalid input force on the next layer down , a less likely but still significant cause of failure .",
    "the implementation of a second layer for the pfb resolves this issue and allows for the vast majority of lattices for our configurations of friction and force cutoff to run to completion .",
    "using pfb beyond two layers increases the yield but not significantly .",
    "we have examined exactly solvable lattice configurations to study the interaction between force - balanced sites to gain insight into how large - magnitude forces may persist in the lattice and what methods beyond externally imposed force limits exist to prevent or remove them . although they do not offer any statistical information , these configurations offer further insight into the nature of the generation and propagation of large magnitude horizontal forces by allowing greater control over the parameters governing the forces in a packing than is found in a stochastic layer - by - layer approach .",
    "we find that four - site lattices represent the smallest meaningful unit of study .",
    "the two configurations which maintain the coordination number four are the two - layer triangular lattice and the quadrilateral shown in figures [ fig:4site.triangular ] and [ fig:4site.quad ] , respectively .",
    "we examine both horizontally periodic and fixed - wall cases .      placing the sites in the familiar triangular lattice shown in figure [ fig:4site.triangular ] , vertical forces",
    "are applied to each site .",
    "because of the symmetry of the system , two angles and a single internal friction coefficient are sufficient to specify the redistribution of forces for the internal contacts . assuming that the known angles are @xmath84 and @xmath85 and the known friction coefficient is given by @xmath86 , the normal forces for the periodic case are          assuming uniform vertical inputs , the periodic case admits solutions near the single - site @xmath47 boundary with the balancing of external forces remaining perfectly satisfied while the magnitudes of the internal normal and frictional forces grow unbounded . a similar result exists in the non - uniform case",
    "once external force and torque balance is taken into account .",
    "the fixed horizontal boundaries case is derived by disconnecting sites 1 and 4 and fixing the direction of the normal forces to be normal to the wall . as the magnitude of the sum of the horizontal components of each normal and frictional force for",
    "each contact must be equal , any restriction placed on the at the wall ( ie . loading ) will place limits on the internal redistribution . by removing the asymmetry of loading in this configuration",
    ", we can prevent the formation of the large magnitude forces",
    ". however , we must be able to specify all the forces along the boundary of the system .",
    "if we are only given the vertical loading , then any restrictions placed on the horizontal force component will be arbitrary .",
    "this result may indicate that successful implementation of probabilistic vector models of force fluctuations requires better understanding of the role of the boundaries .",
    "this question is also crucial to understanding whether the equations underlying these force distributions are elliptic or hyperbolic  @xcite .",
    "the quadrilateral configuration shown in figure [ fig:4site.quad ] offers the advantage of having a `` rotational '' symmetry lacking in both the single - site and triangular lattice configurations .",
    "we have implemented an explicit loop to observe its effect on the internal force redistributions and hopefully allow us insight into the role of this symmetry in the system .",
    "we apply vertical external forces to each site .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are created by pairing the horizontal inputs of sites on the same vertical `` level '' so that they are equal in magnitude and have friction coefficients acting on each site of the pair equally and oppositely .",
    "although the equations of force balance for the system are easily derived , valid configurations are more readily determined numerically .",
    "unbounded horizontal force solutions are supported the redistribution pair consists of the periodic horizontal and the internal force connecting same - level sites .",
    "the internal loop prevents these forces from being passed between vertical levels due to the direction of the tangential frictional forces within the loop being prevented from aligning adversely in neighboring loop sites .",
    "the addition of fixed horizontal boundaries leads to results similar to the triangular lattice configuration .",
    "we see that the introduction of internal symmetry to the system is not enough we are still subject to the effects of an externally imposed asymmetry .",
    "however , we do gain the ability to isolate the effects , in this case over a layer , as opposed to its propagation throughout the system .                                                                      .symbol",
