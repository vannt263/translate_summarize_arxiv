    "questions of how to compare hadronic observables to the apparent underlying fundamental theory of qcd lie at the heart of understanding the nature of strong interactions .",
    "thirty years after its inception , qcd in @xmath7 spacetime dimensions still stubbornly refuses to admit a global solution .",
    "the asymptotic freedom property of the theory permits the perturbative calculation of ( euclidean ) green functions involving large values of momentum transfer or energy release in terms of quarks and gluons , the fundamental objects of qcd .",
    "but at lower scales one enters the nonperturbative regime , which not only invalidates ( or at least complicates ) the standard perturbative methods of field theory developed in qed , but also leads to a dramatic change in the physical spectrum of the theory . instead of quarks and gluons ,",
    "only colorless hadrons are produced as asymptotic states in any process , even at arbitrarily large energy .",
    "many nontrivial theoretical techniques respecting qcd first principles have been developed to study nonperturbative features of the theory . yet despite numerous advances , no one has been able to compute the masses , wavefunctions , or transition amplitudes of hadrons in terms of quark masses and couplings directly from the qcd lagrangian . moreover , many existing theoretical tools are expressed through various expansions in certain small parameters ; the actual range of each parameter where the expansions are applicable is often not well known . in such a situation , it is clearly advantageous to build a soluble toy field theory that incorporates as many features of the qcd lagrangian as possible .",
    "such a theory does indeed exist , the famous t  hooft model @xcite , which is defined by the yang - mills lagrangian in @xmath8 spacetime dimensions in the limit of a large number of colors @xmath9 .",
    "as was shown in the original paper , the quark - antiquark sector of the theory admits an infinite tower of confined , color - singlet solutions that can be obtained , in principle , to an arbitrary degree of numerical accuracy .",
    "the reason for this solubility lies precisely in the defining features of the model .",
    "large @xmath9 eliminates all feynman diagrams with internal @xmath10 loops and nonplanar gluons . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath8 allows gluon self - couplings to be eliminated by gauging away one component of the gauge potential @xmath11 . since only two components are initially present",
    ", the commutator term @xmath12 $ ] in the covariant derivative , which gives gluon self - coupling , vanishes identically in such gauges .",
    "then the only remaining feynman diagrams to be summed for the quark - antiquark green function are `` rainbow '' and `` ladder '' diagrams , whose schwinger - dyson equations can be solved , giving rise to an integral expression called the t  hooft equation ( discussed in sec .",
    "[ thm ] ) .",
    "the t  hooft model provides an excellent laboratory for testing various approaches to strong interaction physics .",
    "after all , the t  hooft equation provides a means to compute hadronic masses , wavefunctions , and transition amplitudes in terms of the underlying partonic degrees of freedom .    in this work",
    "we are specifically interested in questions of local quark - hadron duality in the inclusive decays of heavy quarks . the notion of duality in general terms was first introduced in the early days of qcd in ref .",
    "@xcite but not pursued for quite some time .",
    "a more detailed consideration was given a few years ago by shifman @xcite and later reiterated in a number of papers ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , with applications relevant to minkowskian observables amenable to study via an operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "this allows the formulation of the concept of local duality in a more quantitative way , including nontrivial nonperturbative effects ; we refer the reader to these recent publications for the theoretical aspects . here the question of duality is studied concretely by comparing the weak decay width of a meson containing a heavy quark computed in two ways . in terms of partonic degrees of freedom",
    ", one has an ope depending upon the free quark diagram ( with perturbative corrections ) and a number of nonperturbative matrix elements suppressed by powers of the heavy quark mass . in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom ,",
    "one simply computes the weak decay amplitude for each allowed exclusive channel , and adds them up one by one .",
    "this comparison is especially instructive since one may consider the behavior of solution as the mass @xmath13 of the heavy decaying quark is varied .",
    "such a problem was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the main elements in numerical computations of exclusive decay rates were annunciated .",
    "the hadronic result was compared to the born - level free - partonic diagram as a function of @xmath13 . in terms of the ope ,",
    "the latter is the tree - level piece of the wilson coefficient corresponding to the unit operator .",
    "the numerical agreement was seen to be remarkable , in that the onset of the asymptotic agreement was clearly visible already for relatively small values of @xmath13 . the intrinsically limited numerical accuracy for sufficiently heavy quarks , however , prohibited drawing a definite conclusion about the size of nonperturbative corrections for asymptotically large @xmath13 .",
    "additional numerical studies @xcite considered similar questions for weak decay topologies other than the simple spectator tree diagram , in particular weak annihilation ( wa ) .",
    "the validity of the ope was addressed analytically in refs .",
    "@xcite , which considered on one hand the nature of the ope for heavy quark decays , and on the other an explicit @xmath3 expansion of the decay amplitudes , which allows an analytical summation of the individual decay rates in the asymptotic regime .",
    "the agreement of the two approaches through relative order @xmath14 was obtained by means of a number of sum rules derived directly from the t  hooft equation , the archetype of which first appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite .    while adequate to illustrate the theoretical validity of the ope for the inclusive decay widths of heavy flavors , the analytic methods per se can not help in answering the practical question relevant to phenomenology of beauty and charm quarks : namely , how accurately do the ope - improved parton computations describe the true weak decay width of a heavy flavor meson with finite mass , only a few times larger than the typical strong interaction scale ?",
    "a purely analytic expansion can hardly be used for this purpose , since it is a priori unknown how small an expansion parameter must be for the expansion to start yielding a reasonable approximation , not to mention achieving the necessary precision . to obtain insights into the size of deviations between the actual decay widths and the expressions obtained from the ope for quarks in the intermediate mass range , one must employ real numerical computations .    in this paper",
    "we focus on semileptonic decays of heavy quarks . in the contexts of both real qcd and the t  hooft model , they are technically simpler than nonleptonic decays . moreover , the magnitude of local duality violation is phenomenologically most important in semileptonic decays when one extracts @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we use the techniques developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to evaluate the required decay rates , and confront the total decay width with the expansion in terms of a power series in @xmath3 of ref .",
    "moreover , by making use of a number of relations derived in the large-@xmath13 limit of the t  hooft equation @xcite , members of the set of nonperturbative matrix elements involved can be related to each other , providing an economical description of the nonperturbative physics .",
    "these are the tools that allow us to study the onset of quark - hadron duality .",
    "as explained in appendix  [ newmult ] , we use a scheme based on the modified multhopp method , by which the t  hooft equation is converted into an infinite - dimension eigenvector system that for practical reasons must be truncated at some number @xmath15 of eigenvector modes . the asymptotic convergence of this approach has not been rigorously studied , although it apparently must yield unlimited accuracy when the number of the multhopp modes @xmath15 goes to infinity . yet",
    "the rate of convergence at large @xmath15 is not well known .",
    "additionally , large quark masses turn out to require one to use a larger @xmath15 for sufficient numerical accuracy , as discussed in sec .",
    "it therefore seems mandatory to make an independent cross - check of the numerical accuracy .",
    "we investigate this problem by comparing the numerical values of a number of static properties of heavy mesons at different values of @xmath13 , with the results of their @xmath3 expansions obtained analytically from the t  hooft equation ; this is the topic of sec .",
    "[ check ] .",
    "we find that our solutions have sufficient numerical accuracy for masses @xmath13 corresponding to physical values ( in the sense explained in sec .  [ check ] ) as large as @xmath16gev .    the duality of the inclusive widths of heavy - flavor hadrons to the parton - level widths , including the power corrections from the ope , emerges through a set of sum rules that equate sums of weighted transition probabilities to possible final states and expectation values of the local heavy quark operators . since our main interest lies in @xmath17 transitions , which carry in practice a limited energy release , the most relevant are the so - called small velocity ( sv ) sum rules , which we study here in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the behavior of these sum rules not only shapes the semileptonic @xmath17 decays in actual qcd , but is also important for the determination of the basic parameters of the heavy quark expansion .",
    "an additional advantage of the heavy quark limit for our investigation is that we are able to compute the sv amplitudes semi - analytically , using the exact relations @xcite derived from the t  hooft equations and relying for input only on a few static parameters , which can be computed with a high precision .",
    "a discussion of these relations appears in sec .  [ dual ] .",
    "we find that the sv sum rules in the t  hooft model are saturated to an unexpectedly high degree by the first excitation above the ground state ( which we henceforth call the `` @xmath18-wave '' excitation , despite the fact that in @xmath8 only radial excitations occur ) .",
    "its contributions to even the darwin ( @xmath19 ) and kinetic ( @xmath20 ) expectation values constitute over @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the totals , respectively , while it saturates the `` optical '' sum rule for @xmath23 to a @xmath24 accuracy .",
    "this appears to be an intriguing dynamical feature of the model .",
    "a similar high - saturation effect has been observed in a quark flux - tube model @xcite , for the contribution from the `` valence '' quarkonium states .",
    "we study the size of violations of local duality in the semileptonic decays @xmath25 assuming vectorlike weak currents and massless leptons .",
    "these assumptions are important for comparison with qcd far beyond the obvious parallel of closely resembling the actual world : the strength of the resonance - related duality violation crucially depends on the threshold behavior in the decay probabilities , which is completely different in two and four dimensions .",
    "the two - body phase space , while @xmath26 in @xmath7 , is @xmath27 , that is , infinite at threshold , in @xmath8 . on the other hand , the situation is special for massless leptons : their invariant mass is always zero if they are produced by a vectorlike source , and the weak vertex is then proportional to the momentum . as a result ,",
    "in this case the threshold behavior of the decay rate becomes @xmath26 much in the same way as in real qcd .",
    "this is a crucial detail if one tries to draw practical lessons from the t  hooft model .",
    "the need for a vectorlike coupling in @xmath8 is even more stark for the parton - level calculation .",
    "there one finds that the integrated three - body phase space actually diverges for massless leptons , and only the behavior of the weak decay amplitude renders the width finite .",
    "we provide more arguments in favor of such a choice in sec .",
    "[ wid ] , which is dedicated to the inclusive decay widths .    in sec .",
    "[ vac ] we briefly illustrate how well the duality works for the vacuum correlator of light quarks in the timelike domain .",
    "in the context of the heavy quark expansion this is relevant for the nonleptonic decay widths , including spectator - dependent effects like wa .",
    "section  [ concl ] summarizes our investigation and discusses the conclusions that can be drawn for actual qcd .",
    "appendices describe the computational technique employed and contain a number of relations for the heavy quark limit of the t  hooft equation employed in these numerical studies .",
    "we first review some well - known properties of the t  hooft model both as a reminder and to establish notation .",
    "confinement is manifest in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions with large @xmath9 , and the quark(@xmath28)-antiquark(@xmath29 ) two - particle irreducible green function , i.e. , the meson wavefunction @xmath30 , is given by the t  hooft equation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the momentum fraction in light - cone coordinates carried by the quark , and @xmath33 since @xmath34 is finite in the large-@xmath9 limit , it provides a natural unit of mass .",
    "thus , all masses in this paper are understood as multiples of @xmath34 . indeed , as pointed out in ref .",

    "( [ the ] ) assumes the form @xmath44 we solve the finite - mass t  hooft equation using a numerical method called the multhopp technique @xcite , a venerable system for solving integral equations with singular kernels .",
    "it was first applied to the t  hooft equation in ref .",
    "the idea is to expand the wavefunction in a series of modes , not unlike fourier analysis , and then turn the equations for the mode coefficients into an equivalent infinite - dimension eigenvector problem . in practice ,",
    "one then truncates at some point where the higher modes are deemed to have little effect upon the wavefunction solutions , which is of course strongly dependent on the highest value of @xmath37 used .",
    "the detailed formulas for applying the _ standard _ multhopp technique to mesons with unequal quark masses in the t  hooft model appear in appendix  a of ref .  @xcite .",
    "intrinsic to the original multhopp technique is the evaluation of the wavefunction at a discrete set of points called `` multhopp angles , '' which in the current problem are equivalent to @xmath45 \\ ; , \\hspace{1em } \\;\\ ; k = 1 , \\ldots , n \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the number of modes retained in the numerical solution .",
    "the mode coefficients are then obtained by the use of a discrete inversion formula [ ( a7 ) in @xcite ] .",
    "however , the multhopp solutions can be seen to vanish as @xmath46 and @xmath47 at the endpoints @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively [ see ( a10)(a11 ) in @xcite ] , while the exact solutions are known to vanish as @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , where @xmath52 leading to a type of gibbs phenomenon in the multhopp solutions .",
    "since the multhopp angles cease to sample the wavefunction at some finite distance from the endpoints , it may be expected that the wavefunctions thus obtained are numerically inaccurate there .",
    "this shortcoming led brower , spence , and weis @xcite to improve the multhopp technique by eliminating the multhopp angles and using instead a continuous inversion formula .",
    "the algebraic details are presented in appendix  [ newmult ] , and it is this improved numerical technique that is used in obtaining our results .",
    "let us first establish a bit of notation .",
    "the mass of a heavy quark of flavor @xmath53 is labeled as @xmath54 ; in the weak transitions considered in subsequent sections , the final - state quark @xmath55 is assigned the mass @xmath56 .",
    "the spectator antiquark mass @xmath57 is labeled by @xmath58 , or @xmath59 if there is any chance of confusion .",
    "as explained in the previous section and appendix  [ newmult ] , we use the modified multhopp technique to find numerical solutions of the t  hooft eigenstate problem .",
    "since the heavy meson wavefunctions are peaked near the end of the interval , the accuracy deteriorates with increasing @xmath13 . the same , in principle , applies to the high excitations of light hadrons .",
    "a more appropriate strategy for heavy quarks is to start with a solution of the infinite - mass ( static ) equation .",
    "this has been done analytically @xcite , and full consistency created by the weak current have @xmath60 , this agreement was shown up to and including @xmath61 terms in the weak decay width in @xcite , while terms up to and including @xmath62 were shown to coincide with those in the ope in @xcite . in the current work we take @xmath63 . ] with the ope was demonstrated",
    ".    however , our practical interest lies in the properties of heavy hadrons with @xmath13 lying in the intermediate domain , specifically for @xmath13 one order of magnitude larger than @xmath34 .",
    "the convergence of the @xmath3 expansion in this case is too difficult to quantify analytically .",
    "this is just the situation where the numerical computations are best employed .",
    "therefore , an important element of the analysis is to check the accuracy of the numerical computations of both the heavy hadron masses and wavefunctions at different values of @xmath13 . to this end , we compute the masses and certain moments for the ground and first excited states , and compare them to the analytic @xmath3 expansion . in general , the terms in the @xmath3 expansion depend on a number of expectation values in the static limit , like the kinetic one @xmath64 , etc .",
    "however , one can show @xcite that the parameters appearing here through high order in @xmath3 can be expressed in terms of just the asymptotic value @xmath65 and the corresponding decay constant .",
    "these quantities are the ones most accessible to numerical evaluation ; in particular , @xmath66 is expected to be the most accurately determined quantity .",
    "our main computations refer to the case of @xmath67 , as chosen in ref .",
    "it corresponds ( see sec .  [ dual ] ) to a mass of the strange quark in qcd .",
    "the choice of a noticeable light quark mass may be motivated by an attempt to mimic the effect of the transverse gluons absent in @xmath8 , which in a certain respect supply some effective mass to the light quark .",
    "clearly , this can be only a rather crude approximation , since the bare quark mass breaks chiral invariance .",
    "one can suppose , nevertheless , that this side effect is not too important for our purposes . the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken anyway , and the presence of a massless versus a massive pion does not seem to be essential for the range of problems we address here . on the other hand , the effect of the transverse degrees of freedom is known to soften the @xmath68 singularity of the heavy quark distribution function @xcite , similar to the impact of the light quark mass in the t  hooft model .",
    "the behavior of the distribution function affects the inclusive decays of the heavy quarks in an essential way .",
    "we also present some results for @xmath69 , partly to explore light quark dependences of matrix elements and partly to investigate the beginnings of failure of the numerical solutions as @xmath70 .",
    "the number @xmath15 of multhopp modes used is @xmath71 ; we considered smaller @xmath15 as well to study this dependence , but since the behavior was found to be stable , we do not dwell on it further here .",

    "the critical value of @xmath13 also depends , however , on the meson s light quark mass , decreasing for small @xmath58 .",

    "such a numerical suppression of the power corrections is accidental and does not occur for the excited states , nor for @xmath105 .",
    "let us note that the expectation value of the _ light - quark _ scalar density in the heavy meson turns out very close to unity for the ground state , which may be seen by taking @xmath106 and @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ 56 ] ) and referring to table  [ light ] ; this is a characteristic feature of a nonrelativistic ( with respect to the light quark ) bound - state system .",
    "it implies an almost simple additive dependence of @xmath66 on the light quark mass @xmath58 , @xmath108 and indeed one can verify this feature by comparing @xmath88 values between table  [ t1 ] ( @xmath95 ) and table  [ t2 ] ( @xmath96 ) . while this pattern is expected when the spectator quark is heavy , it a priori needs not hold when it is light",
    "this supports the naive expectation that the chiral symmetry breaking may lead to a description in some aspects resembling the nonrelativistic constituent quark model .",
    "the above expectation value , however , decreases for the excited states , as expected from such a picture .    drawing semi - quantitative conclusions for qcd",
    "requires a translation rule between the mass parameters in the two theories , that is , an estimate of the value of @xmath34 in @xmath109 .",
    "different dimensionful quantities can be taken as the yardstick ; since the theories are not identical , this translation rule must be introduced with some care .",
    "as follows from the heavy quark sum rules , the physics of duality in the decay widths of heavy flavors crucially depends on the properties of the lowest excited heavy - quark states , in particular the @xmath18-wave excitations with opposite parity to the ground - state multiplet .",
    "it will become evident from the next section that they are of primary importance for the @xmath3 expansion of static properties as well .",
    "therefore , we choose the mass difference between the lowest parity - even ( @xmath18-wave ) state and the parity - odd ground - state meson to gauge the translation between the mass scales .    in the t  hooft model",
    "the mass difference @xmath110 for light spectators amounts to about @xmath111 .",
    "real charm spectroscopy suggests that the first @xmath18-wave excitations are between @xmath112 and @xmath113 above the ground state .",
    "taking the larger value for sake of illustration , we arrive at the estimate @xmath114 which is adopted in our analysis .",
    "this falls rather close to the estimate of ref .",
    "@xcite , which relied on a quite different type of effects in the light - quark systems .",
    "assuming a value for the `` bare '' @xmath115 quark mass in qcd ( normalized at the appropriate scale @xmath116 ) of about @xmath117 , we conclude that mesons with quarks of masses @xmath118 represent in the t  hooft model the actual beauty and charm mesons .",
    "the value of @xmath119 seems to be in a reasonable correspondence with the size of this difference in qcd when it is normalized at a low hadronic scale , @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the kinetic expectation value in the t  hooft model turns out to be rather small , @xmath121 .",
    "this is not surprising , since the chromomagnetic field is absent in two dimensions , while it was shown @xcite to be crucial in the real case .",
    "indeed , the comparison is better justified for the difference @xmath122 in actual qcd versus the value of @xmath20 in the t  hooft model .",
    "these questions were discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and can be easily understood using the sum rule representation . due to the absence of spin in two dimensions ,",
    "there is no difference between the would - be spin-@xmath123 and spin-@xmath124 light degrees of freedom . in particular , labeling the `` oscillator strengths '' @xmath125 defined in the next section by spin rather than excitation number , @xmath126 and @xmath127 effectively hold .",
    "then the sum @xmath128 and the latter sum is just the general expression for @xmath129 : @xmath130 accepting such an identification suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and the estimate @xmath131 , we again observe a reasonable agreement with the findings of the t  hooft model .",
    "a useful theoretical limit ",
    "the so - called small velocity ( sv ) regime  was suggested in the mid 80 s @xcite as a theoretical tool for studying semileptonic heavy quark decays .",
    "this refers to kinematics where both @xmath115 and @xmath132 quarks are heavy , but the energy release is limited , so that the velocity of the final charm hadron is small . at large energy release the ope for the width must converge rapidly to the actual hadronic width .",
    "still , at fixed energy release the deviations , although @xmath3 suppressed , are present regardless of the absolute values of masses .    in the sv regime",
    "the semileptonic decays proceed either to the ground - state charm final state , @xmath133 or @xmath134 ( the semi - elastic transitions ) , or to excited `` @xmath18-wave '' states of the opposite parity .",
    "other decays are suppressed by higher powers of velocity , or by heavy quark masses .",
    "the equality of the sum of partial decay widths and its ope expansion is achieved through the sum rules that relate the sums of the @xmath18-wave transition probabilities , weighted with powers of the excitation energies , to the static characteristics of the decaying heavy hadron .",
    "the onset of convergence of the ope expansion for the widths is then directly related to the pattern of saturation of the sum rules by the lowest excitations .",

    "it is also instructive to note that including the calculated power - suppressed ope terms significantly reduces the difference between the actual decay width and its purely partonic evaluation .",
    "moreover , the seeds of oscillations inherent to duality violation ( as functions of quark masses ) , can be seen . since we adopted the truncated ope expansion to mirror the existing implementation of the ope in qcd",
    ", the deviations do not average to zero but rather oscillate around the ( rapidly dissipating ) contributions attributed to discarded higher - order terms .",
    "the numerical effects of duality violation we study turn out to be typically quite small .",
    "partially this can be attributed to moderate size of the corresponding expectation values multiplying @xmath289 corrections in the ope . yet",
    "certainly not all power corrections in heavy quarks are suppressed in the model .",
    "it is well known from ordinary quantum mechanics that masses ( eigenvalues ) typically are much more robust against perturbations than wavefunctions themselves ( or transition amplitudes ) .",
    "we observe a similar pattern in the t  hooft model .",
    "for example , @xmath3 corrections to the meson decay constants turn out very significant even at the scale of the @xmath115 quark mass .",
    "apparently , the inclusive decay rates fall into the class of `` robust '' observables , although , as explained above , this was difficult to anticipate beforehand .",
    "we note here another `` fragile '' observable , the light - cone heavy quark distribution function , which can be measured in decays of the type @xmath290 . in @xmath8 the scaled spread @xmath291 of the @xmath32 distribution approaches @xmath20 at large @xmath13 . yet , as seen in fig .",

    "the point - to - point deviations are clearly still significant , for the decays to only the 4 or 5 lowest final states saturate the overwhelming fraction of the total decay probability .",
    "it is quite conceivable , though , that such deviations are less pronounced in actual qcd owing to the significant resonance widths and to a richer resonance structure .",
    "the vacuum current correlator also turns out to be especially robust ; even neglecting all ope corrections except the leading partonic contribution leads to excellent agreement with the hadronic result .    turning to the direct phenomenological conclusions that can be inferred from our studies , we see that , to the extent our findings can be transferred to real qcd , violation of local duality in the total semileptonic widths of @xmath217 mesons is not an issue .",
    "the scale of duality violation lies far below the phenomenologically accessible limits , and can not affect the credibility of @xmath1 or @xmath2 extractions .    in reality",
    "there are , of course , essential conceptual differences between the two theories , including those aspects that are expected to be essential for local duality ( for a discussion , see ref .",
    "although many seem to optimistically suggest that duality violation is more pronounced in the t  hooft model than for actual heavy flavor hadrons , some differences may still work in the opposite direction .",
    "in @xmath8 there are no dynamical gluons , nor a chromomagnetic field that in @xmath7 provides a significant scale of nonperturbative effects in heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "likewise , there is no spin in @xmath8 , and no corresponding @xmath18-wave excitations of the light degrees of freedom ( the so - called @xmath295 states ) , which seem to play an important role in @xmath7 .",
    "two - dimensional qcd neither has long perturbative `` tails '' of actual strong interactions suppressed weakly ( by only powers of @xmath296s of the energy scale ) . in @xmath8",
    "the perturbative corrections are generally power - suppressed , as follows from the dimension of the gauge coupling . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is conceivable that the characteristic mass scale for freezing out the transverse gluonic degrees of freedom is higher than in the `` valence '' quark channels .",
    "this would imply a possibly higher scale for onset of duality in @xmath297 corrections to various observables .",
    "regardless of these differences , we conclude that presence of resonance structure per se is not an obstacle for fine local quark - hadron duality tested in the context of the ope . as we see in the t  hooft model",
    ", resonances themselves do not seem to demand a larger duality interval .",
    "as soon as the mass scale of the states saturating the sum rules in a particular channel ( quark or hybrid ) has been passed , the decay width can be well approximated numerically by the expansion stemming from the ope .",
    "the ground states of heavy mesons in the t  hooft model exhibit relatively small expectation values of nonperturbative operators ( @xmath20 , @xmath19 , but not @xmath66 ) compared to real qcd , if our identification @xmath298 is adopted .",
    "this may be regarded as a reason for small duality violation for @xmath299 in the model . however , even if we scale @xmath34 up to @xmath300@xmath301 to make up for smallness of the nonperturbative ope effects , the duality violation is still very small , and superficially rather insignificant even in charm .",
    "we note , however , that the specific choice eq .",
