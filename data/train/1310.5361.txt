    "understanding the nature of dark energy , with an inferred magnitude of approximately @xmath0 @xcite , remains the deepest open problem in particle physics and cosmology .",

    ", quantum effects would suggest that this energy , @xmath2 , will depend sensitively on unknown uv physics , and it is therefore very difficult to imagine how the observed small energy scale could naturally arise @xcite .",
    "in particular ( i ) why not @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the uv cutoff of the effective field theory , ( ii ) why not a natural value @xmath5 , which could result from some symmetry constraint ?    the answers to these fundamental questions will most likely require an understanding of a full quantum theory of gravity .",
    "assuming they are resolvable , and that the ultimate vacuum energy is indeed zero , one can proceed to consider whether plausible physics , based on known energy scales in particle theory , might produce at least a temporary residual vacuum energy consistent with current observations .",
    "recently in it was proposed that a higgs portal , mixing electroweak and grand unification @xmath6 scalars , might naturally produce the observed magnitude of the energy density of dark energy due to the false vacuum energy associated with an otherwise new massless scalar field that is a singlet under the sm gauge group .",
    "the questions we examine here are whether it is possible to ensure that this field remains in its false vacuum state for cosmological times , and what the implications might be for the future when it decays to its true ground state .",

    "then the scalar potential becomes @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a bare cosmological constant which must be tuned to cancel uv contributions from the scalar field sector .",
    "the tachyonic mass @xmath19 induces electroweak symmetry breaking and causes the higgs field to acquire a vacuum expectation value @xmath20 , which in turn induces a mass @xmath21 for the field @xmath22 .",

    "assume then that the universe is permeated by a thermal bath of such relativistic , hidden sector ( hs ) particles .",

    "the crossover between the large and small barrier regimes occurs when @xmath130 . to understand this better",

    "after rescaling @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 it becomes @xmath157 where @xmath158 predominantly depends on the `` shape '' of the effective potential , particularly the height of the barrier relative to the scale of degeneracy breaking . as we saw in , @xmath159 becomes independent of all parameters in the limit @xmath160 , which corresponds to @xmath152 .",
    "additionally , the prefactor @xmath161 is independent of @xmath28 to leading order .",
    "thus , the asymptotic behavior seen in is explained . ] for the natural parameter choice , @xmath162 and @xmath130 , the metastable vacuum has a lifetime that exceeds the age of the universe .",
    "while various simple extensions of the higgs - seesaw model appear to make it possible for the false vacuum to be supported over cosmological time intervals , nevertheless , the eventual decay of the false vacuum is inescapable . in the case of thermal support",
    ", the thermal bath will eventually cool due to the expansion of the universe , and the tachyonic instability will reemerge . for typical parameters ( see ) , the allowed temperature range of the hidden sector gas spans only one or two decades .",
    "thus in this case we would expect thermal support to be lost within the next few hubble times once the hidden sector gas cools sufficiently .",
    "this makes the possibility that our vacuum could decay in the not - too - distant future somewhat less fine - tuned than in the quantum support case , where the lifetime of the false vacuum is exponentially sensitive to the parameters , and the metastable state may be extremely long lived if @xmath163 ( see ) .",
    "either way , the false vacuum will eventually decay .",
    "it is worth mentioning , at least briefly that it is possible in principle that the false vacuum has already decayed and that we now sit in the true vacuum with vanishing vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "however , such a possibility is extremely remote as it requires extreme fine tuning . in this case ,",
    "in general the universe today would now be radiation dominated , which is ruled out unless the decay occurred extremely recently ( i.e. see @xcite ) and thus we shall not consider it further here .",
    "a much more interesting question is what ` observable ' effects would result from future decay of the false vacuum in this model .",
    "the word observable is unusual here because in general one might expect that a change in vacuum state would be a catastrophic process for the spectrum of particles and fields , and hence for all structures that currently exist .",
    "however , there is good reason to believe that this would not be the case in this model .",
    "the primary effect of a change in the vacuum in this case would be a small shift in the vev and couplings of the standard model higgs field , to which the singlet scalar would become mixed .",
    "however this effect is of the order of @xmath164 [ see ] and therefore will result in changes in elementary particle masses by less than @xmath165 .",
    "it is hard to imagine that such a shift would produce any instability in bound systems of quarks , nucleons , or atoms .",
    "( it also implies , for the same reason , that no terrestrial experiment we could perform on the higgs at accelerators could in fact determine if this decay has already occurred . )    at the same time , the energy density stored in the false vacuum , while dominant in a cosmological sense , is subdominant on all scales smaller than that of clusters . and",
    "while the release of this energy into relativistic particles might otherwise unbind the largest clustered systems , all such systems would already be unbound due to the expansion induced by the currently observed dark energy .",
    "we therefore may be living in the best of all possible worlds , namely one in which the observed acceleration of the universe that will otherwise remove all observed galaxies from our horizon @xcite will one day end , but also one in which galaxies , stars , planets , and lifeforms may ultimately still survive through a phase transition and persist into the far future .",
    "contrary to naive expectations perhaps , we have demonstrated that it is possible to stabilize a false vacuum associated with a higgs - seesaw model of dark energy , which naively has a lifetime of @xmath166 seconds , so that false vacuum decay can be suppressed for periods in excess of @xmath167 years , without drastically altering the characteristics of the model , or destroying the natural scales inherent within it .",
    "moreover , in this case , even if we are living in a false vacuum , we need not fear for the future",
