    "@xcite more than fifty years ago when they studied the decrease of the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) of lanthanum due to the introduction of magnetic rare earth impurities , an effect later explained in terms of pair breaking by abrikosov and gorkov @xcite . in spite of its interest , to our knowledge",
    "only a few works have addressed the interplay between magnetic impurities and the cooper pairs created in the normal state by the thermal agitation ( the so - called superconducting fluctuations @xcite ) , most of them dealing with the fluctuation - induced electrical conductivity ( or paraconductivity ) , @xmath1 @xcite .    as early suggested on theoretical grounds by schmidt @xcite",
    ", magnetic impurities could enhance @xmath1 through a change in the relaxation time of fluctuating cooper pairs .",
    "therefore , it could be expected that a time independent ( static ) observable like the fluctuation magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 will be unaffected by magnetic impurities , apart from the effects associated to possible changes in the superconducting parameters ( for a recent theoretical work on this issue see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this is in fact the case of high-@xmath0 cuprates : recent measurements @xcite have shown that the fluctuation diamagnetism of optimally - doped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 is not appreciably affected by the presence of magnetic impurities ( both in the cuo@xmath3 planes or intercalated between them ) . in striking contrast , the measurements in lanthanum with diluted magnetic ( pr ) impurities presented in ref .",
    "@xcite have shown an important enhancement of the fluctuation diamagnetism , that is observed to be well larger than the theoretical results for three - dimensional isotropic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the enhancement was found to be proportional to the concentration of impurities , being as large as a factor of 5 for a pr concentration of 2 at.% .",
    "this effect was attributed to a change in the coupling between magnetic ions ( mediated by conduction electrons ) due to the presence of the fluctuating cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , those results were also affected by the experimental uncertainties associated with the strong temperature - dependence near @xmath0 ( curie - like ) of the normal state background , and thus further experimental studies of these striking results are highly desirable .    here",
    "we present measurements of the magnetic - field - dependence of @xmath2 just above @xmath0 in la and la - pr alloys .",
    "the used fields span from @xmath6 t to 3 t , the latter value being three times larger than the upper critical field of the studied samples , where fluctuation effects are expected to be negligible @xcite .",
    "the interest of these new measurements is twofold : on the one side , the smooth @xmath7-dependence of @xmath8 in the normal state will allow a reliable determination of @xmath2 and to check the enhancement with the impurities concentration found in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other side",
    ", these new data will allow to study , for the first time in superconductors with magnetic impurities , the finite - field ( or prange ) regime where fluctuation effects are expected to be strongly reduced with respect to the zero - field limit @xcite .",
    "the samples used in this work ( pure la and la - pr alloys ) are commercial ( alfa - aesar and , respectively , goodfellow ; 99.9% purity ) .",
    "they were used in the previous experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , and a thorough characterization may be found in ref .",
    "the resulting superconducting parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath0 values and the transition widths , @xmath9 , were estimated from the temperature dependence of the low - field magnetic susceptibility . in the case of pure la ,",
    "the transition temperature is well between the ones of pure @xmath10-la and @xmath11-la @xcite , but no traces were observed of diamagnetic steps near these last temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with a mixing of both crystallographic phases at lengths of the order of or smaller than the superconducting coherence length amplitude @xmath12 ( @xmath13  nm , see table 1 ) . the @xmath9 values are about 3% the corresponding @xmath0 values , what will allow us to analyze fluctuation effects above @xmath0 down to reduced temperatures @xmath14 . in presence of a magnetic field , the @xmath15 shift to lower temperatures further increases the accesible temperature range .",
    "the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter at @xmath0 , @xmath16 , and the upper critical field ( linearly extrapolated to @xmath17  k ) , @xmath18 , were obtained from magnetization measurements in the mixed state . in view of the @xmath16 values ,",
    "even pure la is a type ii superconductor , in agreement with earlier results of pan and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of previous @xmath19 measurements in la - pr alloys , but the results found in pure la are consistent with the ones in the literature .",
    "for instance , in refs .  @xcite it is found a thermodynamic critical magnetic field @xmath20 mt for and @xmath21 mt for . by using the relation @xmath22 and the data in table  1 , it results @xmath23 mt , well within these last values . finally , electron mean - free - paths at low - temperatures ( estimated from the residual resistivities ) are of the order or smaller than the corresponding @xmath12 , so",
    "that all the samples may be considered close to the dirty limit .",
    "this excludes the presence of non - local effects on the fluctuation diamagnetism and , therefore , allows an easier comparison with the gl predictions .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -dependence of the magnetic susceptibility just above @xmath0 ( at @xmath24 ) .",

    "[ backs ] we present the magnetic susceptibility of all the studied samples as a function of the magnetic field at a selected reduced temperature , @xmath29 .",
    "even la with 0% pr presents a paramagnetic behavior , probably due to the presence of a small amount ( @xmath30 ) of magnetic rare - earth impurities . the data in fig .",

    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) by using a continuous landau - level approximation ( expected to be useful for reduced fields up to @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "this approach includes a total - energy cutoff to take into account the existence of a limit ( of the order of the cooper pairs size , @xmath39 ) to the shrinkage of the superconducting wavefunction at high reduced magnetic fields or temperatures .",

    "the solid lines represent a fit of expression [ [ final ] ] , with @xmath54 as the only free parameter .",
    "the dashed lines are the empirical formula @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is the pr atomic % ) evidencing that the extra @xmath2 contribution due to pr ions maintains its proportionality with @xmath56 also for @xmath57 . ]",

    "as expected @xcite , the experimental @xmath59 for pure la is in good agreement with eq .",
    "( [ dmener ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath2 amplitude increases with the pr content ( almost linearly , in view of fig .",
    "[ efectovsx ] ) .",
    "moreover , on increasing the impurities concentration the @xmath58-dependence becomes less pronounced .",
    "these experimental evidences suggest that the magnetic impurities enhance some contribution , additional to @xmath60 having a smoother @xmath58-dependence . as first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , a natural candidate for the origin of such a contribution is the variation of the coupling between magnetic ( pr ) impurities due to the condensation of cooper pairs .",
    "the argument is as follows : in alloys with diluted magnetic impurities , the main vehicle for the interactions between these impurities is the electronic sea . a small variation of the density of normal electrons is expected to vary linearly the coupling strength between these impurities ( _ e.g. _ , through the variation of the effective fermi vector in the rkky model of electron - mediated interaction between diluted magnetic impurities ) .",
    "as the condensation of cooper pairs due to superconducting fluctuations will directly decrease the density of normal electrons , it may be expected that a contribution to the experimental @xmath59 will appear in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the fluctuation - induced superfluid density , @xmath63 is an unknown constant , and @xmath56 is the magnetic impurity concentration ( in atomic percents ) to which @xmath64 is naturally expected to be proportional .",
    "similar variations of the magnetization associated with the rkky interaction due to the condensation of cooper pairs and leading to effects proportional to @xmath65 were proposed previously , although not in the context of the superconducting fluctuations , by anderson and suhl for la - gd systems in 1959 @xcite , and more recently for certain borocarbides in refs .",
    "another reasoning proposed by bergeret",
    "_ et al . _",

    "( b ) linear increase of the magnetic susceptibility in the normal state ( at a reduced temperature @xmath24 ) , as measured with @xmath67  t. the experimental uncertainty in @xmath8 is of the order of 0.01% , and thus the corresponding error bars are not appreciable .",
    "]    we calculate @xmath68 for an isotropic 3d superconductor on the same grounds as eq .",
    "( [ dmener ] ) ( i.e. , using the ggl approach above @xmath0 with a total - energy cutoff and for @xmath69 ) . for that",

    "are already normalized by @xmath53 , the only free parameter is @xmath63 .",
    "the agreement is excellent , in some cases even above @xmath85 .",
    "the resulting @xmath63 value ( @xmath86 ) is reasonably close to the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from low - field @xmath2 measurements against the temperature ( @xmath87 ) , taking into account the important uncertainties associated to the background subtraction in this last case ( mainly affecting the @xmath2 amplitude ) .",
    "the data in the region @xmath57 can be fitted to the empirical formula @xmath88 , indicating then that the extra @xmath2 contribution due to pr ions maintains its proportionality with @xmath56 also for @xmath57 .",
    "it is worth noting that legvold _",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath0 depression with the pr concentration in la - pr ( which is consistent with the abrikosov - gorkov theory , see fig .",
    "[ magnetic](a ) ) is close to the one of non - magnetic la - y and la - lu alloys .",
    "this led them to suggest that pr in the la - pr alloy could be in a singlet state , an that there is little evidence for pr - pr interactions in these materials . in relation with this , in a recent paper kogan and prozorov @xcite calculated that if the upper critical field increases with the impurities concentration , the system may not be in the purely magnetic scattering regime , and non - magnetic scattering should also be taken into account . however , our observed @xmath18 variation with the pr concentration is quite similar to the experimental uncertainty .",
    "values were obtained from measurements of the reversible magnetization in the mixed state . due to the highly irreversible nature of the latter in la - pr alloys ,",
    "@xmath18 was obtained as the average of the field - up and field - down contributions .",
    "the uncertainty associated with this procedure is comparable with the seeming variation of @xmath18 with @xmath56 . ] by this reason , in our simplified model we have ignored a possible contribution coming from non - magnetic scattering .",
    "also , the linear increase of the magnetic susceptibility in the normal state with the pr concentration ( see fig .  [ magnetic](b ) ) clearly indicates that pr does introduce some moderate additional magnetic moment in the alloy .",
    "our present results indicate thus that even these relatively weak magnetic moments ( even if perhaps they do not dominate the @xmath89 shift ) may profoundly affect the diamagnetic contribution coming from superconducting fluctuations above @xmath0 .",
    "the present results contrast with the behavior observed in high-@xmath0 cuprates , where the magnetic impurities ( within the cuo@xmath3 layers or intercalated between them ) lead to inappreciable effects in the fluctuation - induced magnetic susceptibility once the change in the @xmath0 value is taken into account .",
    "this suggests that in these materials the pairs created above @xmath0 by thermal fluctuations lead to a negligible effect on the interaction between magnetic impurities .",
    "we have presented detailed measurements of the diamagnetism induced by superconducting fluctuations in a bcs superconductor ( la ) under the simultaneous presence of magnetic impurities ( pr ) and external magnetic fields .",
    "it is found that magnetic fields approaching the upper critical field at @xmath90  k are very effective reducing the fluctuation effects .",
    "however , counter intuitively at first , the magnetic impurities lead to an important enhancement of the amplitude of the fluctuation magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this enhancement is roughly proportional to the concentration of magnetic impurities , and is as large as one order of magnitude for concentrations of only 2 at .",
    "% of pr in la .",
    "the experimental data are interpreted in terms of a change of the coupling between magnetic impurities ( mediated by conduction electrons ) , induced by the presence of fluctuating cooper pairs . according to this , to analyze the experimental data we proposed a gaussian ginzburg - landau model for @xmath2 which includes an _ indirect _ contribution proportional to the impurities concentration , @xmath56 , and to the cooper pairs density , @xmath65 .",
    "this approach includes a total - energy cutoff to account for the short - wavelength modes excited at high reduced magnetic fields , and is expected to be applicable up to @xmath91 .",
