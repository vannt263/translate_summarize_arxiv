    "_ korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equations _ are typical dispersive nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "zabusky and kruskal @xcite observed that kdv equation owns wave - like solutions which can retain their initial forms after collision with another wave .",
    "this led them to name these solitary wave solutions `` solitons '' .",
    "these special solutions were observed and investigated for the first time in 1834 by scott russell @xcite . later in 1895 , korteweg and",
    "de vries @xcite showed that the soliton could be expressed as a solution of a rather simple one - dimensional nonlinear pde describing small amplitude waves in a narrow and shallow channel of water @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is some constant , @xmath2 denotes the gravitational constant , @xmath3 is the density , @xmath4 the surface tension and @xmath5 denotes the surface displacement of the wave above the undisturbed water level @xmath6 .",
    "the equation can be written in non - dimensional , simplified form by the transformation @xcite : @xmath7 to obtain the usual kdv equation @xmath8 ( subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 denoting partial differentiations ) , with the soliton solution is given by @xmath11 the kdv equation has a broad range of applications @xcite : description of the asymptotic behaviour of small- but finite - amplitude shallow - water waves @xcite , hydromagnetic waves in a cold plasma , ion - acoustic waves @xcite , interfacial electrohydrodynamics @xcite , internal wave in the coastal ocean @xcite , water wave power stations @xcite , acoustic waves in an anharmonic crystal @xcite , or pressure pulse propagation in blood vessels @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the _ linearized kdv equation _ ( also known as generalized airy equation ) in one space dimension @xmath12 where @xmath6 stands for a source term and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are real constants such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "recall that for @xmath17 and @xmath18 we recover the case considered by zheng , wen & han @xcite .",
    "although the pde   looks very simple , it has a lot of applications , e.g.   whitham @xcite used it for the modelling of the propagation of long waves in the shallow water equations , see also @xcite .",
    "we emphasize the fact that the restriction of the solution to equation to a finite interval is not periodic . thus concerning the numerical simulation",
    ", we can not use the fft method and we consider instead the equation set on an interval and supplemented with specially designed boundary conditions . since the linear pde is defined on an unbounded domain , one has to confine the unbounded domain in a numerical finite computational domain for simulation . a common used method in such situation consists in reducing the computational domain by introducing _ artificial boundary conditions_. such artificial boundary conditions",
    "are constructed with the goal to approximate the exact solution on the whole domain restricted to the computational one .",
    "they are called _ absorbing boundary conditions ( abcs ) _ if they lead to a well - posed initial boundary value problem where some energy is absorbed at the boundary .",
    "if the approximate solution coincides on the computational domain with the exact solution on the whole domain , they are called _ transparent boundary conditions ( tbcs)_. see @xcite for a review on the techniques used to construct such transparent or artificial boundary conditions for the schrdinger equation .",
    "the linearity property of equation allows to use many analytical tools such as the laplace transform . using this tool , zheng , wen & han @xcite derived the exact tbcs for equation at fixed boundary points and then obtained an initial boundary value problem `` equivalent '' to the problem in the whole space domain .",
    "moreover , using a dual petrov - galerkin scheme @xcite the authors proposed a numerical approximation of this initial boundary value problem .",
    "thus the derivation in @xcite of the adapted boundary conditions is carried out at the continuous level and then discretized afterwards .",
    "recently , zhang , li and wu @xcite revisited the approach of zheng , wen & han @xcite and proposed a fast approximation of the exact tbcs based on pad approximation of the laplace - transformed tbcs .    in this paper",
    "we will follow a different strategy : we first discretize the equation with respect to time and space and then derive the suitable artificial boundary conditions for the fully discrete problem using the @xmath19-transformation .",
    "the goal of this paper is therefore to derive analogous conditions of the transparent boundary conditions obtained by the authors in @xcite but in the fully discrete case .",
    "these discrete artificial boundary conditions are superior since they are by construction perfectly adapted to the used interior scheme and thus retain the stability properties of the underlying discretization method and theoretically do not produce any reflections when compared to the discrete whole space solution",
    ". however , there will be some small errors induced by the numerical root finding routine and the numerical inverse @xmath19-transformation and also later due to the fast sum - of - exponentials approximation .",
    "let us finally remark that there exists also an alternative approach in this `` discrete spirit '' , namely to use discrete multiple scales , following the work of schoombie @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section",
    "[ continuous ] we use the ideas of zheng , wen & han @xcite to obtain the tbcs for the linearized kdv equation and we briefly recall the results given in @xcite for the special case @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in section  [ fullydisc ] we present an appropriate space and time discretization and explain the procedure to derive the artificial boundary conditions for the purely discrete problem mimicking the ideas presented in section  [ continuous ] . since exact abcs are too time - consuming , especially for higher dimensional problems , we propose in section  [ s : expo ] to use a sum - of - exponentials approach @xcite , to speed up the ( approximate ) computation of the discrete convolutions at the boundaries . finally , in section  [ num ] we present some numerical benchmark examples from the literature to illustrate our findings .",
    "the motivation for this section is twofold .",
    "first , we briefly recall from the literature the construction of tbcs for the 1d linearized kdv equation for the special case @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the well - posedness of the resulting initial boundary value problem @xcite .",
    "secondly , we extend the derivation of tbcs to the generalized case @xmath20 and @xmath16 ; these results will serve us as a guideline for the completely discrete case in section  [ fullydisc ] .    to do so",
    ", we consider the cauchy problem @xmath21 where ( for simplicity ) the initial function @xmath22 and the source term @xmath6 are assumed to be compactly supported in a finite computational interval @xmath23 $ ] , with @xmath24 and where @xmath25 and @xmath16 are given constants .",
    "for the construction of tbcs in the case of non - compactly supported initial data we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "[ rmk : u2 ] changing the sign of @xmath14 means to reverse the time direction , we therefore only consider the positive case . moreover , if one reads the equation as @xmath26 , we can perform the change of unknown @xmath27 and the equation for @xmath28 becomes @xmath29 the dispersive constant @xmath14 can therefore be eliminated from the generalized airy equation and be considered to be equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the construction of ( continuous ) artificial boundary conditions associated to problem  is established by considering the problem on the complementary of @xmath23 $ ] , _ i.e. _ @xmath31 denoting by @xmath32 the laplace transform in time of the function @xmath33 , we obtain from the _ transformed exterior problems _ @xmath34 where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , stands for the argument of the transformation , i.e.  the dual time variable .",
    "the general solutions of the ode are given explicitly by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 denote the roots of the ( depressed ) cubic equation @xmath41    the three solutions are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44    [ theo : continuous ] the roots of the cubic equation possess the following _ separation property _ @xmath45    the proof of the theorem [ theo : continuous ] is given in appendix [ proof : theo : cont ] .",

    "for the ( r - cn ) scheme , we will recover as in the continuous case a cubic equation , but a quartic equation for the ( c - cn ) scheme .",
