    "recently quark matter at very high density has attracted a great flurry of interest @xcite . in this limit , quark matter is expected to behave as a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "possible phenomenological applications are associated with the description of neutron star interiors , neutron star collisions and the physics near the core of collapsing stars .    in a superconductive phase ,",
    "the color symmetry is spontaneously broken and a hierarchy of scales , for given chemical potential , is generated . indicating with @xmath3 , the underlying coupling constant , the relevant scales are : the chemical potential @xmath8 itself , the dynamically generated gluon mass @xmath9 and the gap parameter @xmath10 with @xmath11 a calculable constant .",
    "since for high @xmath12 the coupling constant @xmath3 ( evaluated at the fixed scale @xmath8 ) is @xmath13 , we have : @xmath14 massless excitations dominate physical processes at very low energy with respect to the energy gap ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "their spectrum is intimately related to the underlying global symmetries and the way they are realized at low energies .",
    "they also obey low energy theorems governing their interactions which can be usefully encoded in effective low energy lagrangians ( like for cold and dilute qcd @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to order the effective lagrangian terms describing the golstone boson self interactions in number of derivatives .",
    "the resulting theory for dilute qcd is named chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this well defined scheme is not sufficient for a complete description of hadron dynamics since new massive hadronic resonances appear at relatively low energies like the @xmath16 or the vector @xmath17 and new effective lagrangians of the type described in @xcite are needed .",
    "another set of relevant constraints is provided by t hooft anomaly matching conditions @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the low energy spectrum , at finite density , displays the correct quantum numbers to saturate the t  hooft global anomalies .",
    "it was also observed that qcd at finite density can be envisioned , from a global symmetry and anomaly point of view , as a chiral gauge theory @xcite .",
    "in reference @xcite it was demonstrated , using a variety of field theoretical tools , that t hooft anomaly matching conditions must hold for any cold but dense gauge theory .    in this paper",
    "we construct the electroweak interactions to complete the low energy effective theory describing quantum chromo dynamics with two and three flavors at high density .",
    "this work can be considered as the first step for properly describing the phenomenology associated with electroweak processes stemming , for example , from the core of some neutron stars which may be dense enough to be in a two , three or both flavor superconductive phases @xcite .",
    "some possible implications of electroweak interactions in compact objects for 3 flavors qcd at high matter density has been also partially investigated in @xcite .    the low energy theory for two flavors without considering electroweak interactions",
    "is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite while the one for three flavors has been developed in @xcite .",
    "we use the non linear framework @xcite to construct the low energy theories .",
    "first for the three flavor case , we include the @xmath18 interactions and complete the low energy theory by implementing the global anomalies via the wess - zumino - witten term .",
    "this topological term is essential when describing the time honored @xmath19 process at finite density @xcite .    by considering in detail the axial anomaly at the fundamental level and by comparing it with the gauged version of the wess - zumino term",
    "we demonstrate that the coefficient of the topological term is the same as zero density .",
    "the only place where the finite density effects enters are in the redefinition of the electric charge which is now given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 and in the high density value of the goldstone bosons decay constant .",
    "our result stems directly from the higgsing nature of the color superconductive phase and it is at variance with the result presented in @xcite .",
    "we briefly comment on the nature of the discrepancy .    besides the importance of the @xmath22 process per se and its phenomenological consequences when investigating possible quark - type stars featuring a cfl core , the topological coefficient term is also critical when considering the solitonic ( skyrme ) solutions of the effective lagrangian .",
    "in fact now we have the same winding number as for ordinary qcd and hence we get massive excitations , which after collective quantization , describe spin half particles with quantum numbers identical to the ordinary baryons .",
    "this is the actual realization of the quark - hadron continuity @xcite advocated for the baryon - type sector of the color - superconductive phase .",
    "we then introduce the electroweak interactions for 3 flavors .",
    "next we generalize the effective lagrangian theory for 2 flavors presented in @xcite to describe electroweak interactions .",
    "we observe that the lagrangian not only reproduces the physical eigenstates for the photon and the eighth gluon @xcite but also predicts a modified coupling of the quarks to the neutral vector boson @xmath4 with respect to the zero density case . the physical effect , which is our main result for the 2 flavor case , is not suppressed with respect to the zero density weak processes . on general grounds we expect this result to affect the quark - stars ( with a 2sc component ) cooling processes @xcite via neutrino emission .",
    "in particular we have in mind the neutrino transparency question directly related to the mean free path of a neutrino in a compact star .",
    "this question has already attracted some interest @xcite . indeed for ordinary neutron stars @xcite the mean free path is significantly affected by the @xmath23 scattering reaction due to the presence of neutral currents . in a 2sc star",
    "we then expect the @xmath24 scattering to play an equally important role .    in sect .",
    "[ 3f ] we study the anomalous process @xmath25 at high matter density , complete the effective lagrangian for the quasiparticle goldstone bosons by adding the wess - zumino term and comment on related issues . in sect .",

    "[ cinque ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "let us start with the case of @xmath27 light flavors . at zero density only the confined goldstone phase is allowed and the resulting symmetry group is @xmath28 .",
    "indeed there is no solution for the t hooft anomaly conditions with massless composite fermions leaving intact the flavor group . in this case",
    "the topological wess - zumino term for the goldstone bosons is needed to implement the global anomalies of the underlying theory at the effective lagrangian level .",
    "the vafa - witten theorem @xcite , valid for vector - like theories , prohibits the further breaking of the remaining vector - like symmetries like @xmath29 .    turning on low baryon density we expect the theory to remain in the confined phase with the same number of goldstone bosons ( i.e. 8) .",
    "evidently the t hooft anomaly conditions are still satisfied . at very high density ,",
    "dynamical computations suggest @xcite that the preferred phase is a superconductive one and the following ansatz for a quark - quark type of condensate is energetically favored : @xmath30 and a similar expression holds for the right transforming fields .",
