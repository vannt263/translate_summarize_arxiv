    "[ basic ] that we have analyzed here .",
    "for instance , they consider exchanges of gluon ladders with arbitrary numbers of rungs . in addition , they concentrate on the region of integration space in which the rapidities of the rungs are strongly ordered",
    ". it should be evident that the calculation given above could be applied to more complicated diagrams",
    ". there would be little to change in the pattern of cancellation found here , which illustrates the general argument of ref .",
    "@xcite , although the notation would have to be more complicated .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that although factorization applies in the strongly ordered region that gives the leading small @xmath112 logarithms , factorization also applies in other regions : strong ordering of rapidities is not essential to the argument .",
    "the argument presented here applies when the exchanged gluons have transverse momentum of order @xmath29 , and when none of the lines outside of the hard scattering has virtuality much larger than @xmath31 .",
    "this is also the region discussed in ref .",
    "other regions than the one we considered here are correctly treated by other parts of the factorization proof in @xcite .",
    "let us close with a few additional comments relating our work to that of ref.@xcite .",
    "use modified agk cutting rules to perform their calculation , finding a remainder after summing over final states .",
    "such an analysis , however , assumes that the incoming particles to which the ladders attach are on - shell .",
    "in addition , we believe that this analysis is exact only at the level of leading logarithms . however , their noncancelling result ( eq .  ( 8) in ref.@xcite ) , which is proportional to the square of the real part of their single - ladder exchange amplitude , is suppressed by two logarithms compared to leading logarithms .",
    "we may note two specific differences between our analysis and that of gotsman _",
    ", both of which are important beyond the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "first , they ignore certain final - state cuts , for example cut b in fig .",
    "[ jetcut ] .",
    "this cut crosses the side of a ladder .",
    "such a cut is not allowed in the leading logarithm approximation , but it is present when one goes beyond leading logarithms . observe that the cut in question would not be kinematically allowed if the gluon ladder coupled to on - shell quark lines instead of internal off - shell lines .",
    "second , gotsman _",
    "_ appear to have ignored the loop integral that we label @xmath113 , which we use to prove that the subgraph @xmath69 is independent of the final state cut of @xmath114 ( _ step 3 _ ) .",
    "both the extra cuts and the integral over @xmath113 are necessary to evaluate the ladder region fully .",
    "the proof of factorization that we gave in ref .",
    "@xcite applies to the full leading - power contribution and not just to leading logarithms .",
    "it is this more general method that we have explained in the context of particular feynman graphs .",
    "although we believe that factorization works , we should emphasize our concern that improvements are needed in the rigor of existing proofs of factorization @xcite .",
    "conspicuously lacking are iterative algorithms for demonstrating ( [ factth ] ) along the lines of those available for proofs of renormalization .",
    "our presentation here is not a step in this direction , rather it is an illustration of already - existing arguments .",
    "we believe , however , that it is possible to construct such an algorithm ( _ cf .",
    "improvements in the proof would help both to increase confidence in factorization and to clarify its variant applications , for instance to transverse momentum distributions @xcite in the range of @xmath115 .",
