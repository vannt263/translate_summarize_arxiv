    "this work focuses on stability conditions and their possible relations to different fermi surface topologies in a superconductor with unequal number densities of fermions ( or unequal chemical potentials)@xcite .",
    "the physics of paired fermion systems with unequal densities of the two fermion species is of interest in the study of two physical systems : ( 1 ) ultracold atomic fermionic gases , where one can freely choose populations in two hyperfine states of the fermionic atom .",
    "experimental work is currently being conducted with these systems .",
    "( 2 ) quark matter in the interior of neutron stars , which is believed to be a color superconductor .",
    "there , the mismatch in quark fermi surfaces is driven by differences in quark masses and electric and color neutrality conditions . in both cases , the ground state of such",
    "a system is the subject of current debate .",
    "the study of fermionic superfluids with imbalanced populations is a novel subject , because until recently , experimental evidence for this situation was elusive . in a superconductor ,",
    "an imbalance in population between spin - up and spin - down electrons can be created by a magnetic field .",
    "however , due to the meissner effect , the magnetic field is either completely shielded from the superconductor bulk or enters in the form of quantized flux lines or vortices .",
    "cold fermionic atomic gases provide new possibilities in the experimental exploration of fermionic superfluids with unequal mixtures of fermions . in cold atoms ,",
    "feshbach resonance permits tuning of the interaction from ( 1 ) attraction and a resulting superfluid of loosely bound pairs ( the bcs regime at @xmath1 ) ; to ( 2 ) repulsion and a resulting bose - einstein condensate of tightly bound molecules ( the bec regime at @xmath2 ) , where @xmath3 is the size of a pair and @xmath4 is the interparticle separation ( or , more precisely , the mean free path ) . with equal mixtures , the bec  bcs crossover is smooth , with no phase transition . with asymmetric densities ,",
    "one or more phase transitions are expected , and a more complex phase diagram may result .    in the weak coupling regime , a bcs superfluid remains stable as long as the difference in chemical potential is small compared to the pairing gap , @xmath5 ; the gap prevents the excess unpaired atoms from entering the superfluid state . by either increasing the mismatch or reducing the binding energy ( and hence decreasing the gap ) , a quantum phase transition from the superfluid to normal state takes place , and superflidity ceases .",
    "the point at which the phase transition occurs is known as the clogston limit , which can be estimated as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fermi energy .",
    "thus only an exponentially small population imbalance is allowed in weak coupling . in strong coupling , as one approaches feshbach resonance , the situation is quite different . on the bec side , superfluidity with imbalanced population",
    "is robust over a wide range of parameter space .",
    "surprisingly , on the bcs side , macroscopic imbalance is also possible in a superfluid state , possibly due to the formation of a gapless superfluid at strong coupling .",
    "this gapless superfluid incorporates large numbers of unpaired fermions which reside at the secondary fermi surfaces .",
    "here , we consider stability conditions for gapless states with different fermi surface topologies .",
    "we consider two species of nonrelativistic fermions , @xmath8 with the same mass but with different chemical potentials , @xmath9 .",
    "there is an attractive interaction only between different species of fermions , @xmath10 .",
    "the order parameter is @xmath11 where @xmath12 , it defines pairing in the singlet channel , spin @xmath13 , @xmath14\\times [ 2]=[1]+[3]$ ] .",
    "the order parameter breaks the original group associated with conservation of particle numbers of each species down to the diagonal subgroup associated with conservation of difference in particle numbers , @xmath15 which is invariant under simultaneous rotation @xmath16 .",
    "total number of particles is not conserved .",
    "formally , one can express this pattern of symmetry breaking by gauging the theory .",
    "we introduce two external gauge fields , and couple each species of fermions to its gauge field , @xmath17 couples to @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 couples to @xmath21 with @xmath22 , that is reflected by the generators of the gauge group , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "there is a different mixing of gauge fields in case of debye masses . in qcd , with color and electromagnetic gauge groups , @xmath31 , mixing of gauge fields",

    "consequently , the number susceptibility contains terms of arbitrary many fermion loops too , corresponding to the exact debye mass including all possible perturbative insertions .",

    "number of zeros is equivalent to number of the fermi surfaces .",
    "no zeros corresponds to the fully gapped state . in case of one fermi surface ,",
    "momenta outside the fermi surface contribute to the pairing , while the excess of fermions resides inside the fermi ball . in case of two fermi surfaces",
    ", the excess of fermions resides between the two fermi surfaces in momentum space .",
    "as was noticed by son , apart from number of zeros , dispersion can have two different characteristic behaviors , distinguished by the position of the minimum .",
    "minimum is located at nonzero momentum for positive @xmath65 , and corresponds to bcs , and minimum shifts to @xmath66 for negative @xmath7 , and corresponds to bec .",
    "this behavior manifests itself in stability conditions .",
    "we depict different topologies which are distinguished by the number of fermi surfaces on the phase diagram in dimensionless average chemical potential @xmath67 and difference in chemical potentials @xmath68 , the gap is the energy scale , in fig .",

    "we have fully gapped @xmath69 , and gapless states with one @xmath70 and two @xmath71 fermi surfaces . at small mismatch",

    "increasing mismatch , when mismatch is at least larger than the gap , there is a gapless state with one fermi surface @xmath70 when @xmath7 is around the feshbach resonance , @xmath73 , and gapless state with two fermi surfaces @xmath71 for positive @xmath7 restricted from below , @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore expect that @xmath70 exists at strong coupling , while @xmath71 probably exists only at weak coupling .",

    "we avoid solving for the ground state explicitly .",

    "all unstable regions with respect to the screening masses and number susceptibility are subset of unstable region with respect to the pressure . in a weak coupling , the vertical dashed - dotted line reproduces the known clogston limit , @xmath93 , above which bcs is unstable .",
