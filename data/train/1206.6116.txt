    "these limitations make it imperative to identify and study lbgs at lower redshifts ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the primary reason for the lack of dropout selected lbgs at @xmath0@xmath1  is that we need highly sensitive space - based cameras to observe the mid- to near - ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths required to identify lyman break at @xmath0@xmath1 .",

    "understanding the lbgs at @xmath14 is vital for two main reasons .",
    "first , we need to study the star - formation properties of these lbgs , because they are at redshifts corresponding to the peak epoch of the global star - formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "second , they are likely lower redshift counterparts of the high redshift lbgs  because of their identical dropout selection and similar physical properties  whose understanding will help shed light on the process of reionization in the early universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are primarily three techniques to select star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 : ( 1 ) _ sbzk _ ( using the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 bands , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , it is essential to apply identical selection criteria at all redshifts to properly compare galaxy samples and accurately trace their evolution . the lbg selection is widely used to select high redshift ( @xmath4 ) galaxies , and to do equal comparison with these galaxies , here we investigate physical properties of lbgs at @xmath14 .",

    "we should also emphasize that it is very challenging to completely understand these various effects based on observations only , rigorous modeling and/or simulations are required to fully assess the contributions of these various effects on the uv spectral slope @xmath3 .",
    "we compare observed sed with a suite of model templates from cb07 to find the best - fit model through @xmath42 minimization .",

    "the ers observations are too limited in area and depth to cover a larger luminosity range , so we can not predict how this relation will evolve for luminous ( @xmath8822.5  mag ) or dwarf ( @xmath8919  mag ) galaxies at these redshifts .",

    "we find that a proportionality with a logarithmic slope of 0.90 provides a good fit to the data with few outliers at stellar mass greater than 10@xmath83  m@xmath84 .",

    "the scatter in the sfr versus stellar mass relation for lbgs at @xmath0@xmath1  is slightly larger than @xmath70.3 dex  observed at @xmath10 by @xcite  possibly because of few galaxies forming a sharp edge towards high sfr values , as seen in the relation for @xmath22- and @xmath23-dropouts ( upper panel in figure  [ fig : mass_sfr ] ) .",
    "these galaxies have low stellar ages ( less than 10  myr ) , which could be highly uncertain as discussed in   [ age_mass_sfr ] .",
    "it is also possible that this edge could be an artifact due to lower limits on the model parameters @xmath55 and _ t _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that @xcite argue that the tightness in the sfr - stellar mass relation depends on the assumed sfh .",
    "the scatter in this relation is much less for a constant sfh , while it is much larger for other sfhs .",
    "therefore , it is also likely that the larger scatter we see in figure  [ fig : mass_sfr ] could be due to different sfhs .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass_sfr ] shows that , though our data has little more scatter compared to the ms relation at @xmath90 , the majority of our galaxies fall on to this relation characterized by a logarithmic slope of 0.90 .",
    "a similar correlation is observed at @xmath77@xmath13 by @xcite , and supported by cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite .",
    "our observations confirm this ms relation for star - forming galaxies from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , implying that  on average  their star - formation histories are similar .      in previous sections , we have shown that lbgs at @xmath0@xmath1   on average  are massive , dustier , and have higher star - formation rates than lbgs at @xmath21@xmath9  with similar luminosities , though it should also be noted that they are not very different within estimated 1@xmath6 uncertainties . as pointed out by @xcite , the number densities of galaxies at fixed luminosity could change substantially over this redshift range , which could lead to potential biases when comparing galaxies at different redshifts . however , the general trends we observe in stellar masses , sfrs , and dust extinction are supported by other independent means .",
    "the characteristics uv luminosity ( @xmath82 ) is increasing as a function of redshift from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ( e.g. , h10 ) , which implies increase in sfrs with time , while @xcite have shown that stellar masses for @xmath94 lbgs grow from @xmath74 to @xmath93 . the uv spectral slope @xmath3 shows evolution as a function of redshift ( figure  [ fig : beta_z ] ) , which could indicate lower dust content at higher redshifts .",

    "* ) , while the @xcite supports the lower dust content in lbgs at @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the ensemble properties of lbgs in our sample are in general agreement with the expected results .    the stellar mass  uv luminosity relation ( figure  [ fig : mass_abs ] ) and the sfr  stellar mass relation ( figure  [ fig : mass_sfr ] ) are based on measurements from best - fit seds , therefore , it is possible that these quantities are not totally independent , which might affect their observed correlations . to investigate this ,",

    "a two - sided k - s test  in each panel  indicates a probability _ less _ than 0.05 that the distributions ( red and black histograms ) are drawn from the _ same _ parent distribution .",
    "the constancy of the m / l ratio and ssfr between @xmath8 and @xmath9 agrees very well with the constant slope we find in figure  [ fig : mass_abs ] and figure  [ fig : mass_sfr ] for our sample of lbgs , though with a slightly larger scatter .",
    "stellar masses of lbgs at @xmath0@xmath1  are generally well correlated with uv absolute magnitude and current sfr , as expected for star - forming galaxies at similar redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these correlations implies very similar mass assembly and sfh for these galaxies , but the exact nature of sfhs is still not clearly understood .",
    "@xcite showed that the cosmologically averaged sfrs of star - forming galaxies at @xmath96  at constant co - moving number density  increase smoothly from @xmath97 to @xmath1 , and the stellar mass growth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived sfh .",
    "the scenario of rising sfh ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also supported by recent results from the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the models with rising sfhs conflicts with the assumptions that the sfr in distant galaxies is either constant or decreasing exponentially with time ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "though , we remind the reader that the models with rising sfhs advocated by @xcite and others correspond to a cosmologically averaged sfhs for typical galaxies , and not individual galaxies , because they could involve random events that changes their instantaneous sfr . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also argue that rising sfhs are most beneficial to higher redshift ( @xmath78 ) galaxies .",
    "we find that for our assumed sed model parameters , the lbgs between redshift @xmath8 and @xmath9  on average  have similar sfhs , though the precise nature of sfhs at all redshift is still under debate , and could also affect the sfr ",

    "our analysis demonstrates that the dropout selected galaxies at @xmath0@xmath1   within luminosities probed here  show similar correlations between physical parameters ( sfr , stellar mass , uv luminosity ) as other star - forming galaxies selected using different color criteria ( e.g. , @xmath98 , bx / bm ) at @xmath10 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xcite conclusion that majority ( @xmath78090% ) of the dropout selected galaxies overlap with other color selected star - forming galaxies with stellar masses less than 10@xmath83  m@xmath84 .",
    "the stellar mass range for our current sample is between @xmath710@xmath99 and @xmath710@xmath83 m@xmath84 , with sample completeness around 10@xmath100 m@xmath84 .",
    "significant differences between the dropout selected sample and other color selected samples of star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 exists for massive galaxies ( @xmath8710@xmath83 m@xmath84 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is vital to use uniform selection technique at all redshifts to avoid any selection biases .",
    "the lyman break dropout technique is the most convenient and widely used method to select galaxies at @xmath78 , and we have shown that lbgs at @xmath0@xmath1  selected using this dropout technique have similar physical properties ( within uncertainties ) as lbgs at @xmath21@xmath9  with similar luminosities .",
