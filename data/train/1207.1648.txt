    "the ability to move with respect to an obstacle without dissipating energy is one of the most intuitive and appealing definition of superfluidity .",
    "this is the reason why the motion of quantum fluids with respect to obstacles has been used in several experiments aiming at revealing a superfluid behavior in different physical systems : @xmath0he ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , @xmath1he ( ref .   ) , ultracold atomic vapors @xcite and more recently polariton condensates @xcite .    for a weakly perturbing impurity moving at constant velocity @xmath2 in a conservative atomic bose ",
    "einstein condensed ( bec ) system at zero temperature , the landau criterion @xcite predicts that there exists a critical velocity @xmath3 separating two different behaviors : ( i ) for @xmath4 no excitations are emitted away from the obstacle and , hence , there is no drag force ; ( ii ) for @xmath5 a cherenkov radiation of linear waves occurs ; these waves carry momentum away from the impurity which is thus subject to a finite drag force .",
    "the first regime is superfluid and the second one is dissipative@xcite .    in a pumped non - equilibrium polariton condensate , even when kinematically allowed , propagating disturbances are always damped due to the finite lifetime of the polaritons . as a result",
    ", the well defined transition between superfluid and dissipative regimes transforms in these damped systems into a crossover characterized by different forms of wave patterns : localized for small enough flow velocity ; oscillatory and extended for large enough flow velocity .",
    "the boundary between these two regimes is typically not abrupt : just at the transition point the decay length of a propagating wave is less than its wavelength and this disturbance can hardly be distinguished from a localized perturbation",
    ". it might thus be difficult to separate a superfluid regime from a dissipative one by studying the wave pattern created by an obstacle .",
    "nevertheless , the concept of superfluidity is often employed because it permits a simple qualitative discussion of the processes taking place in the flow of a polariton condensate .    in the present work we study in detail the wake of a polariton condensate past an obstacle and the associated drag force .",
    "we argue that , for low enough damping , the superfluid / dissipative transition is better understood in term of a crossover of the force experienced by the obstacle from a viscous drag to wave resistance , in analogy to what is observed for capillarity - gravity waves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we study the flow of a polariton condensate past an obstacle disregarding possible effects of polarization of the light modes in the cavity .",
    "we consider a configuration in which excitons are confined in a one - dimensional quantum wire and , as a result , the polariton condensate is described by an order parameter @xmath6 whose dynamics is modeled by a gross  pitaevskii equation of the form @xmath7 in eq .",
    "@xmath8 is the polariton effective mass ( in the parabolic dispersion approximation , valid at small momenta ) , @xmath9 is the polariton density and @xmath10 describes the potential of a localized obstacle , possibly in motion relative to the polariton gas .",
    "interaction effects are described by an effective local repulsive term characterized by the nonlinear coupling constant @xmath11 .",
    "there is a whole body of evidence showing that the overall effective interaction between polaritons is repulsive .",
    "some of the most direct manifestations of this repulsion are the observed emission blueshift @xcite and the expulsion of the condensate from a pumping region @xcite .",
    "another consequence of repulsion , very important for the present study , is the absence of scattering from a defect  first observed in refs .",
    "and the related emission of nonlinear excitations@xcite ( solitons and vortices ) whose generation is typically associated to a loss of superfluidity @xcite .    due to the finite lifetime of the polaritons ,",
    "the system needs to be pumped .",
    "following refs .  , we schematically describe this effect by the last term of eq .  :",
    "the term @xmath12 phenomenologically describes the combined effects of the pumping and decay processes and for @xmath13 an overall gain leads , if not compensated , to an exponential increase of the density .",
    "this increase is counterbalanced by the term @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 ) which accounts for a saturation of the gain at large density and allows to reach a steady state configuration  resulting from dynamical equilibrium between gain and losses  with a finite density @xmath16 .",
    ".   corresponds to a situation where the pumping extends over all space .",
    "this models a system where an obstacle is present within a large reservoir , and simplifies the theoretical treatment because the stationary density in absence of external potential is constant .",
    "results where the obstacle is present outside of the pumping region will be presented in a forthcoming publication@xcite .",
    "localized structural defects are naturally present in many samples ; they can also be artificially created by means of lithographic techniques or by a continuous - wave laser . if an obstacle is introduced into the condensate , the state with uniform density @xmath17 is disturbed .",
    "we suppose that the obstacle is described by a potential @xmath18 with a finite spatial extension [ verifying @xmath19 as @xmath20 . in many experiments",
    "the condensate is put into motion with respect to the obstacle by resonant pumping . here",
    "we rather describe a situation with non - resonant pumping , where condensation can be forced to occur in a finite - momentum state by seeding the system with a short coherent - light pulse @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that the gross features of the theoretical study of the wave patterns and of the drag force are not essentially affected by the technique used for setting the fluid into motion . this is supported by a comparison of the results of the present work with the one of ref .   where a continuous transition at a critical velocity ( possibly different from the speed of sound ) is also observed in a perturbative study of a resonantly driven polariton fluid .",
    "as just discussed , in typical experiments with polariton condensates the obstacle does not move and instead the condensate is put into motion with some velocity @xmath2 .",
    "however we shall sometimes use for convenience a reference frame in which the condensate is at rest ( far enough from the obstacle ) and where the obstacle moves with velocity @xmath21 : @xmath22 .",
    "a comprehensive study of this problem can be done in the case of an obstacle represented by a weak potential which induces a wave disturbance corresponding to small modifications of the parameters of the flow . in this configuration",
    "the problem can be treated in the framework of perturbation theory which is presented in the next section of the paper .",
    "this corresponds to the extension to damped systems of previous perturbative studies of bec atomic vapors  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the case of a @xmath23-peak impurity is of special interest because its solution corresponds to the green function of the problem , and we treat it with special care . in sec .",
    "[ nonlinear ] instead , we consider the wave pattern generated by the flow of a polariton condensate past a _",
    "strong _ obstacle potential , when perturbation theory does not longer apply . in this case , it is appropriate to distinguish between _ wide _ and _ narrow _ obstacles depending on the ratio of their sizes to the healing length @xmath24 ( @xmath24 is the de broglie wavelength of polaritons moving with the sound velocity ; see its definition in the next paragraph ) .",
    "when a narrow obstacle moves at supersonic speed the downstream profile has a rather smooth behavior which can be described by a dispersionless approach , the hydraulic approximation which we present in sec .",
    "[ hydraulic ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the upstream - wave structure can be represented ( for small enough damping coefficient ) as a weakly modulated nonlinear periodic wave which is a damped dispersive shock wave .",
    "such shocks have been studied for the case of a wide obstacle with the use of whitham modulation theory in ref .  .",

    "note however that , in absence of damping , experiment performed on atomic condensates @xcite and theory @xcite show that there is a regime of time - dependent flows for impurity velocities close to the speed of sound .",
