    "this fact is related to symmetry enhancement at the d3-brane near - horizon geometry @xcite and it guarantees that both theories are invariant under the @xmath7 supergroup . however , many interesting theories like qcd are not conformally invariant .",

    "moving away from the origin of the moduli space means that the scalar fields have non - zero expectation values .",
    "this is also known as the coulomb branch of the theory .",

    "we conclude that in this limit the theory is described by the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) with @xmath163 .",
    "the deformation in this lagrangian is the result of integrating out the massive w particles , defining an effective lagrangian near the ir fixed point .",

    "we see that for @xmath171 the one - loop result ( [ 1loop ] ) gives exactly the same answer as ( [ lagr ] ) if we take the irrelevant operator @xmath139 to arise from the dbi corrections .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath172 terms are exact because they are not renormalized by higher loop diagrams @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we start with pure sym theory and break conformal invariance by going to the coulomb branch of the theory . by integrating out the massive w particles we derived an effective lagrangian near the ir fixed points that has the form conjectured in @xcite .",
    "following the analysis of @xcite the two - point function for the operator @xmath152 dual to the dilaton field is & = & + & = & + & = & + & &  , [ 2pfb ] where we are just keeping the term that will give the @xmath173 correction calculated in the gravity approach .",
    "notice that the two - point function for the operator @xmath152 is written in terms of two- and three - point functions of chiral primary operators at the ir @xmath18 conformal fixed point . since these are expected to be protected",
    "[ 32,38 - 43 ] the perturbative field theory and strongly coupled gravity approaches should give the same result .",

    "the first term in the last equality gives the leading term in the scattering cross - section , while the second term gives the logarithmic correction .",
    "the latter is associated with a process where a virtual pair of gauge particles interacts with the incident wave to create a pair of gauge particles .",
    "the strength of such interaction is determined by the effective action that arised from integrating out the w particles . to match the logarithmic term in the field theory calculation we should set the ultraviolet cut off to @xmath174 .",
    "this is related to the natural scale in the field theory side @xmath175 by @xmath176 .",
    "a better understanding of the ultraviolet cut off requires extending the cross - section calculation to the next order @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that the scale @xmath174 is the gravity mass gap and may be related to the existence of colour singlet condensates of w particles at strong coupling @xcite .      as explained in section 2",
    "the two throats can be separated in the decoupling limit as long as @xmath62 ( recall figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) ) .",

    "additionally , the vev for the higgs field breaks the gauge symmetry to @xmath0 . in other words",
    ", we consider the coulomb branch of the deformed theory .",
    "this is very similar to the single - centered case studied in @xcite where conformal invariance was broken by setting @xmath177 while remaining at the origin of the moduli space of vacua .",
    "intriligator argued that in the uv this theory is dual to the asymptotically flat space . in the ir",
    "we end up with the @xmath18 ir conformal fixed points corresponding to each throat .",
    "it is convenient to write the operators @xmath151 and @xmath139 in ( [ oper ] ) using the following notation _ 4_4^_1+o_4^w+o_4^_2 & ~ &  , + o_8_8^_1+o_8^_1w+o_8^w+&~ & + & &  , [ ymoper ] where the indices @xmath178 run over the @xmath179 gauge group and the indices @xmath180 over the @xmath181 gauge group . in the expression for @xmath139",
    "we wrote just the terms that are important for the absorption by the first hole .",
    "also , we dropped a four point vertex with one @xmath179 gauge particle , one @xmath181 gauge particle and two w bosons ( @xmath182 ) because it gives a negligible correction for large @xmath3 . similarly to the previous section , the two - point function for the operator @xmath152 is _ ^(x)o_(0)_h=1 & = & + & = & + & = & + & & + & &  , [ 2pfa ] where we are just keeping the leading terms .",
    "first consider the terms inside the squared brackets in the last equality .",
    "the first term is the two - point function for the @xmath18 theory at the infrared conformal fixed point and it gives rise to the leading term in the absorption probability ( [ csection1 ] ) .",
    "this term is associated with a process where the incident wave interacts with the brane to create a pair of gauge particles ( see figure 3(a ) ) @xcite .",
    "the first logarithmic correction in the absorption probability ( [ csection1 ] ) arises from the second term in the squared brackets .",
    "this correction was analyzed in @xcite and it is associated with a process where a virtual pair of gauge particles interacts with the incident dilaton wave to create a pair of gauge particles ( see figure 3(b ) ) . finally , the other logarithmic correction in the cross - section arises from the third term in the squared brackets .",
    "this corresponds to a process where a virtual pair of w bosons interacts with the incident dilaton wave to create a pair of gauge particles ( see figure 3(c ) ) .",
    "the last two field theory processes have the correct energy and @xmath51 dependence to account for the logarithmic corrections to the cross section .",
    "however , how to match precisely the numerical factors remains an open question .",
    "as observed in the previous subsection , an appropriate understanding of the uv cut off would require extending the analysis to the next order .",
    "the cross - section for all the above processes is calculated from the discontinuity of the momentum space two - point function across the positive real axis in the @xmath156-plane .",
    "in fact , the correction @xmath183 is also associated to the creation of a pair of w bosons via a virtual pair of gauge particles . in this case",
    "the momentum space two - point function has an extra discontinuity in the @xmath156-plane over the real axis for @xmath184 .",
    "since we work at energies @xmath161 , well below the threshold where the channel for w boson pair production opens , this process is not seen in the gravity calculation here employed .",
    "similarly , the fourier transform of the terms outside the squared brackets in ( [ 2pfa ] ) will have a cut for @xmath184 and are associated with the creation of w boson pairs .",
    "the main goal of this work was to investigate the coulomb branch of @xmath1 sym theory using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this was done by studying the scattering of a minimally coupled scalar field by two parallel stacks of d3-branes .",
    "technical reasons forced us to consider processes at energy scales much smaller than the threshold for w boson pair production .",
    "despite this fact we were still able to find new phenomena in this phase of the theory .",
    "firstly , for small brane separation , we considered the field theory dual to the tree - like throat geometry .",
    "this is a point on the coulomb branch of @xmath1 sym theory .",
    "near the ir fixed points the theory can be described by integrating out the massive w particles . as a result",
    ", the effective lagrangian leads to a correction to the cross - section that is associated with the creation of gauge particles through the production of virtual pairs of gauge particles .",
    "this result is perfectly consistent with the classical gravity calculation .",
    "secondly , for large brane separation , we considered the theory that results from connecting both throats with asymptotic flat space .",
    "this is associated with the dbi corrections to the sym theory . in this case",
    "we found corrections to the cross - section that are associated with the creation of gauge particle pairs through the production of virtual pairs of gauge particles and of w bosons .",
    "for both small or large brane separation the w particles that arise from the @xmath185 symmetry breaking process are seen to play an important role in the gravity / gauge theory correspondence .",
    "while these particles are essential to identify the appropriate field theory processes associated with the logarithmic corrections to the classical cross section , the problem of matching exactly the numerical factors remains unsolved .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend our results to higher energies .",
    "in particular , one would like to see the channel for w bosons pair production to open up in the gravitational side of the correspondence . however , the scale in the gravity side is given by the mass gap energy @xmath86 .",
    "as noticed earlier , this fact is expected to be related to the existence of colour singlets of bps stretched strings with large binding energy .",
    "hence , by studying the classical absorption for energies @xmath186 we could obtain some information about these bound states .",
    "maybe our best hope would be to study numerically the solutions of laplace equation in the double - centered d3-brane geometry .",
    "as far as the w particles are concerned , it looks that in the gravity limit these particles are not seen directly and that we may need the full string theory on @xmath2 to recover them .",
    "an obvious extension of this work is to consider the scalar absorption by the double centered m - brane geometries .",
    "unfortunately , in this case we do not have the input from d - brane and sym physics to fully understand the dual field theory picture .",
    "another interesting venue of research would be to study the four- and five - dimensional black hole cases .",
    "these are related to the @xmath187 and @xmath188 dualities , respectively .",
