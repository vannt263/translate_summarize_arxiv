    "one of the most important solutions of einstein s equations is the stationary axisymmetric kerr solution which in boyer - lindquist coordinates reads @xcite ds^2=dt^2-dtd[kerr ] - ^2d^2-dr^2-d^2 , where = r^2 - 2 m r+a^2  , = r^2+a^2 ^ 2  .",
    "this solution describes the exterior gravitational field of a mass @xmath0 with specific angular momentum @xmath1 .",
    "it is asymptotically flat and reduces to the minkowski metric in the limit @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and to the schwarzschild metric in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the kerr spacetime is characterized by the presence of a curvature singularity determined by the equation r^2 + a^2 ^2= 0 which corresponds to a ring located on the equatorial plane @xmath4 .",
    "this ring singularity , however , can not be observed from outside because it is covered by a horizon located on a sphere of radius r_h = m+  . since",
    "no information can be extracted from behind the horizon , an external observer will never be aware about the existence of the ring singularity . in this sense ,",
    "the singularity can be considered as non - existing for observers located outside the horizon .",
    "the kerr spacetime can be therefore interpreted as describing the exterior gravitational field of a rotating black hole .",
    "furthermore , the black hole uniqueness theorems @xcite state that the kerr spacetime is the most general vacuum solution that corresponds to a black hole . in other words , to describe a black hole , we only need two parameters , namely , mass and angular momentum .    in the case",
    "@xmath5 , no horizon exists and the ring singularity becomes naked .",
    "however , several studies @xcite show that in realistic situations , where astrophysical objects are surrounded by accretion disks , a kerr naked singularity is an unstable configuration that rapidly decays into a kerr black hole .",
    "furthermore , it now seems to be well established that in generic situations a gravitational collapse can not lead to the formation of a kerr naked singularity .",
    "these results seem to indicate that rotating kerr naked singularities do not exist in nature .",
    "again , these results corroborate that the kerr spacetime describes rotating black holes .    from an astrophysical point of view",
    ", black holes belong to the class of compact objects which include also neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "the question arises whether the kerr metric can also be used to describe the exterior gravitational field of neutron stars and white dwarfs . to try to answer this question ,",
    "let us recall that from the point of view of general relativity , the gravitational field of a compact source should be described by a complete riemannian differential manifold , i.e. , it should include an exterior metric and an interior metric as well . let us suppose for a moment that the kerr spacetime describes the exterior field of all compact objects , and consider the interior counterpart . in the case of black holes , in which the matter content of the original star has collapsed to form a curvature singularity , we argue that it is not possible to find the interior counterpart within the framework of classical general relativity .",
    "indeed , since all the information about the internal structure of a black hole is located inside the singularity , where the classical theory is not valid any more , we should apply an alternative theory that must take into account the effects of gravity under extreme pressures and densities , as intuitively expected at the singularities .",
    "such a theory could be quantum gravity which , in the best case , is still under construction .",
    "this argument implies that the quantum interior counterpart of the kerr metric is well beyond our reach in the short term .",
    "consider now the interior field of neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "an interior metric should describe an equilibrium structure , probably a fluid , bounded by a surface of zero pressure and matched across this surface to the exterior kerr metric .",
    "the search for such an interior solution has been conducted for over 50 years , and not even a single physical meaningful solution has been found to date .",
    "many arguments can be found to explain this negative result , especially , regarding the relatively simple models used to describe the internal structure of such compact stars .",
    "nevertheless , if we consider a more elaborated internal model , the mathematical complexity of the field equations and the matching conditions usually increases as well , implying that the possibility of solving the problem decreases .",
    "this is probably the reason why the search for physically meaningful interior solutions has not been very successful . in our opinion ,",
    "the simplest solution to this problem is to assume that the kerr metric does not describe the exterior field of rotating compact objects , but black holes .",
    "this is exactly the working hypothesis we will assume henceforth .",
    "the question arises : what metric should we use to describe the exterior field of neutron stars and white dwarfs ?",
    "the black hole uniqueness theorems @xcite sheds some light on how to look for an answer to this question .",
    "in fact , black holes are described by only the mass @xmath0 and the angular momentum @xmath6 . from the point of view of the multipole structure of exact vacuum solutions ( for a review see , for instance , @xcite ) , this is equivalent to saying that only the lowest multipoles are present in black holes , namely , the mass monopole @xmath0 and the angular - momentum dipole @xmath6 .",
    "then , it seems reasonable to include higher moments in order to describe the exterior field of compact objects , other than black holes .",
    "the simplest choice to begin with is the mass quadrupole .",
    "consequently , we assume in this work that to describe the exterior field of neutron stars and white dwarfs , we need a vacuum metric with three physical parameters , namely , mass @xmath0 , angular momentum @xmath6 , and quadrupole @xmath7 . from a physical point of view , it is also reasonable to consider the mass quadrupole as an additional parameter , because it represents the natural deviations of a mass distribution from the ideal spherical symmetry . in other words , we assume that in the case of neutron stars an white dwarfs , it is not possible to neglect the gravitational field generated by the quadrupole , whereas in the case of black holes , the uniqueness theorems prove that the quadrupole is zero",
    ".    on the other hand , since the uniqueness theorems are valid only in the case of mass and angular momentum , with the kerr metric as the only exact solution , there must exist several exact solutions with mass , angular momentum and quadrupole .",
    "the main goal of this work is to present a review and a brief description of the main exact vacuum solutions of einstein equations with mass quadrupole .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] , we focus on static gravitational sources .",
    "we present the field equations and describe the most important properties that a metric should satisfy in order to describe the exterior field of a compact source .",
    "we present the explicit form of the metrics that , to our knowledge , have been used in general relativity to describe the field of static mass distributions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : star ] , we study the rotating generalizations of the quadrupolar metrics . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : interior ] , we describe the uninspiring situation in the case of interior solutions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] , we discuss the situation in general and comment on the open problems regarding the description of the gravitational field of neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "to describe the exterior gravitational field it is necessary to obtain exact solutions of einstein s equations in empty space .",
    "since einstein s field equations are in general difficult to handle , especially when the aim is to obtain physically meaningful solutions , it is necessary to assume the validity of certain physical conditions about the problem under consideration .",
    "we assume that the gravitational field of compact stars do not change drastically in time so that stationarity can be adopted . in general , we know from observations that this condition is satisfied in most astrophysical objects . moreover",
    ", the assumption of stationarity does not exclude the possibility of rotation which is an important characteristic of all known compact stars . to consider the deviations of the mass distribution from spherical symmetry",
    ", we will assume the existence of an axis of symmetry which for the sake of simplicity is supposed to coincide with the axis of rotation .",
    "moreover , to take into account the deformations of the mass distribution with respect to the axis of symmetry , we will consider only the quadrupole moment .",
    "the above assumptions imply that we must focus our analysis on the case of stationary axisymmetric gravitational fields .",
    "the corresponding line element in the case of empty space is known as the weyl - lewis - papapetrou @xcite line element that in cylindrical coordinates can be written as @xcite ds^2 = f(dt - d)^2 -  .",
    "[ lel ] here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the coordinates associated to the killing vector fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 which represent stationarity and axial symmetry , respectively .",
    "the functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend on the spatial coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that einstein s vacuum field equations reduce in this case to f(f",
    "_ + f_zz + ^-1 f _ ) - f_^2 - f_z^2 + ^-2 f^4(_^2+_z^2 ) = 0  , f ( _ + _ zz - ^-1 _ ) + 2 f__+ 2 f_z_z = 0  , _",
    "= f^-2(f_^2 - f_z^2 ) - ^-1 f^2(_^2 - _ z^2 )  , _ z = f^-2 f_f_z - ^-1 f^2 _ _ z  , where @xmath17 , etc . from this set of equations",
    "it follows that @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be considered as the main metric functions since @xmath14 can be calculated by quadratures once the main functions are known .      although the field equations are apparently highly non - linear and complicated , it turned out that they are characterized by an internal symmetry related to the lie transformations of differential equations .",
    "the investigation of this internal symmetry led to the formulation of modern solution generating techniques which , when formulated in an appropriate manner , allow us to generate new solutions from known ones @xcite .    the starting point for the understanding of the lie transformations was the ernst @xcite representation of the field equations .",
    "ernst proposed a simple lagrangian density from which the field equations can be derived .",
    "moreover , ernst s lagrangian can be derived from the einstein - hilbert lagrangian and , in fact , similar representations @xcite can be derived for any gravitational fields with two commuting killing vector fields , for example , for einstein - rosen gravitational waves or inhomogeneous cosmological gowdy models . in the case under consideration",
    ", it can be shown that the einstein - hilbert action can be reduced to the form _ eh = ( f_^2 + f_z^2 + _ ^2 + _ z ^2 ) +  , [ redlag ] where the new function @xmath18 is defined by the relationships _",
    "= f^2 _ z  , _ z = - f^2 _  . neglecting the boundary terms",
    ", the above action can be expressed as _ eh = = ( de ) ( de^ * )  , e = f + i  , d=(_,_z )  , [ ernstlag ] where @xmath19 is the ernst potential which is complex for stationary fields and real in the limiting static case @xmath20 .",
    "finally , it can be shown that the main field equations can be obtained as = 0  , = 0 = 0  .",
    "clearly , the compactness and simplicity of ernst s formulation is very useful for investigating the field equations .",
    "for instance , from ( [ ernstlag ] ) it can be seen that the transformation @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , does not affect the lagrangian and , consequently , the field equations .",
    "it follows that this  gauge \" transformation can be used to generate new solutions .",
    "in fact , it is known that the kerr - nut ( newman - unti - tamburino ) solution can be obtained from the kerr solution by applying a  gauge \" transformation .",
    "a further computational advantage of the use of the ernst representation is that it is coordinate invariant in the sense that in order to analyze it in a different coordinate system , one only needs to calculate the explicit form of the vector operator @xmath23 in the new coordinates .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the ernst representation reproduces only partially einstein s equations because it includes only the main functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the metric function @xmath14 does not appear in the reduced lagrangian ( [ redlag ] ) because it turns out to be a cyclic coordinate in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian which is absorbed by a legendre transformation .",
    "however , it is possible to interpret the reduced lagrangian as determining the action of a generalized harmonic map from which the equations for the function @xmath14 can be recovered @xcite",
    ".      one can find many stationary axisymmetric solutions of einstein s equations , but not all them are necessarily suitable to describe the gravitational field of compact stars .",
    "several physical conditions must be imposed which can be described as follows .",
    "@xmath24 the spacetime must be asymptotically flat .",
    "this means that far away from the source the gravitational field should be negiglible small , and can be described approximately by the minkowski metric .",
    "@xmath25 the spacetime must be elementary flat , i.e. , the axis of symmetry must be free of conical singularities .",
    "this property means that the coordinate @xmath9 is a well - defined angle coordinate that can be used to represent the rotation of the compact star .",
    "@xmath26 the spacetime must be free of singularities outside the surface of the star .",
    "curvature singularities can exist inside the surface where the vacuum solution is not valid any more and , instead , an interior solution should exist that `` covers '' the singularity .",
    "@xmath27 the spacetime must be free of horizons in order to be in accordance with the black hole uniqueness theorems .",
    "@xmath28 the solution must reduce to the minkowski metric in the limiting case when the mass monopole vanishes , independently of the values of the remaining parameters .",
    "this condition guarantees that there are no rotations and no deviations from spherical symmetry without the presence of a physical mass distribution .",
    "@xmath29 the solution must be matched with a physically meaningful interior solution across the surface of the star where the pressure and the density of the interior configuration should vanish .",
    "the fulfillment of these conditions represents the real challenge for describing the gravitational field of compact stars . whereas there many metrics that can be used to represent the exterior field , the interior counterparts are still unknown .",
    "any exact solution of einstein s equations can be written in many equivalent ways by using different coordinate systems . nevertheless , some coordinate systems are specially adapted to the geometric properties of the field configurations . in the case of stationary axisymmetric solutions ,",
    "the system of prolate spheroidal coordinates has been used extensively in the scientific literature to represent several important particular solutions . in this case",
    ", the general line element can be expressed as & & ds^2 = f(dt - d)^2 + & - &  , [ lelxystar ] where all the metric functions depend on @xmath30 and @xmath31 , only .",
    "the simplest way to represent the corresponding field equations in this case is by using the complex ernst potentials e = f+i  , =   , where the function @xmath18 is now determined by the equations ( x^2 - 1)_x = f^2_y  , ( 1-y^2)_y = - f^2 _ x  .",
    "then , one can show that the main field equations can be represented in a compact and symmetric form as ( ^*-1 ) \\{[(x^2 - 1)_x]_x + [ ( 1-y^2)_y]_y } = 2 ^ * [ ( x^2 - 1)_x^2 + ( 1-y^2)_y^2 ]  , [ eqksixy ] where the asterisk represents complex conjugation .",
    "notice that in the case of static fields the ernst potentials become real and the above equation generates a linear differential equation for @xmath32 for which the general solution can be obtained .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that equation ( [ eqksixy ] ) is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath33 .",
    "this simple symmetry property can be used to generate new solutions .",
    "indeed , consider the particular solution = = 0 = 0 f=  , = which can be shown to represent the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "then , the function @xmath34 is also an exact solution .",
    "furthermore , if we take the linear combination @xmath35 , with arbitrary constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and introduce it into the field equation ( [ eqksixy ] ) , we obtain the new solution",
    "^-1 = x+i y  ,   =  , which corresponds to the kerr metric in prolate spheroidal coordinates . the corresponding metric functions are @xmath38",
    "the simplest case of a multipolar spacetime is described by the schwarzschild metric which possesses only the mass monopole .",
    "theorem @xcite guarantees that this metric is unique .",
    "furthermore , from a physical point of view , one expects that a dipole moment can be made to vanish by an appropriate coordinate transformation which , in the newtonian limit , corresponds to locating the origin of spatial coordinates on the center of mass of the object .",
    "the next interesting configuration consists of a mass with quadrupole moment . in this case , no uniqueness theorem exists and , therefore , we can expect that einstein s equations permit the existence of several solutions describing such a gravitational system . indeed , several exact solutions are known .",
    "weyl @xcite found the most general static axisymmetric asymptotically flat solution in cylindrical coordinates ( [ lel ] ) f = 2 _ n=0^ p_n ( )  , =  , [ weylsol ] where @xmath39 @xmath40 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath41 represents the legendre polynomials of degree @xmath42 .",
    "as mentioned above , the metric function @xmath14 can be calculated by quadratures .",
    "then , we obtain @xcite = - _ n , m=0^ ( p_np_m - p_n+1p_m+1 )  .",
    "the set of parameters @xmath39 essentially determines the set of mass multipoles @xmath43 as computed by using the geroch - hansen definition @xcite , for instance .",
    "then , a configuration composed of a mass and a quadrupole can be written as f = + p_2 ( ) the first term is called the chazy - curzon metric @xcite and describes the field of two particles located along the symmetry axis with a curvature singularity among them , i.e. , it corresponds to a strut located along the axis .",
    "the second term can be considered as representing a quadrupole deformation of the strut . far away from the source",
    ", the chazy - curzon metric leads to the newtonian potential of a point particle .",
    "one could therefore expect that in the newtonian limit the second term generates a quadrupole moment . from a physical point of view",
    ", one would expect that close to a non - rotating compact star with no quadrupole , the metric is spherically symmetric .",
    "we see that the above weyl metric does not satisfy this condition .",
    "we therefore conclude that it can not be used to describe the exterior field of compact stars .    to our knowledge ,",
    "erez and rosen @xcite found the first quadrupolar metric which reduces to the schwarzschild metric in the limit of vanishing quadrupole . in prolate",
    "spheroidal coordinates ( [ lelxystar ] ) it can be expressed as ( @xmath44 is a constant ) f = + q_2 ( 3y^2 - 1 )  , = & & ( 1+q_2)^2 - q_2 ( 1-y^2 ) ( x + 2 ) + & & + q_2 ^ 2 ( 1-y^2 )  . in the limiting case @xmath45 , the erez - rosen metric reduces to the schwarzschild metric , as expected for a compact star . in general , this solution is asymptotically flat and free of singularities outside the spatial region determined by @xmath46 , which in the case of vanishing quadrupole corresponds to the schwarzschild radius .",
    "it also satisfies the condition of elementary flatness . from this point of view",
    ", the erez - rosen solution satisfies all the conditions to describe the exterior field of a deformed mass with quadrupole moment .",
    "however , no interior solution is known that could be matched with the exterior metric on the surface of the body .",
    "gutsunayev and manko @xcite derived the following exact static solution ( @xmath47 is a constant ) f = + 2 a_2  , = & & + [ 3(1 - 5y^2)(x^2-y^2)^2 + & & + 8 y^2 ( 3 - 5y^2)(x^2-y^2 ) + 24 y^4 ( 1-y^2 ) ] + + & &  .",
    "although at first glance these two solutions look quite different , it is possible to show @xcite that if we choose the parameters as a_2 = q_2  , the quadrupole moment of both metrics coincide , but differences appear at the level of the @xmath48-pole moment .",
    "a different quadrupolar metric was derived by hernndez - pastora and mart  @xcite which is also given in prolate spheroidal coordinates : f = + b_2 \\ { [ ( 3x^2 - 1)(3y^2 - 1 ) - 4 ] - + x(3y^2 - 1 ) }   . as in the previous cases , the corresponding @xmath14 function can be calculated by quadratures by using the explicit for of @xmath12 only .",
    "the resulting expression is quite complicated .",
    "we refer to the original paper for the explicit expression . in the above solution",
    ", the constant parameter @xmath49 essentially determines the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution .",
    "recently , in @xcite , the multipole moment structure of the above solutions with free parameters @xmath44 , @xmath47 and @xmath49 was investigated in detail with the result that the geroch quadrupole moment of all three metrics can be made to coincide by choosing the free parameters appropriately . on the other hand , it is known that in general relativity , stationary and axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes can be completely characterized by their multipolar structure and if two spacetimes have the same moments , then they represent essentially the same spacetime .",
    "if then follows that the above metrics with free parameters @xmath44 , @xmath47 and @xmath49 are in fact the same spacetime , if we consider only the quadrupole moment .",
    "however , if higher moments are taken into account , differences appear that make the three metrics different from a physical point of view .",
    "as can be seen from the above expressions , the explicit form of the known quadrupolar metrics is not simple , usually making them difficult to be analyzed . in a recent work @xcite , we proposed an alternative solution as the simplest generalization of the schwarzschild solution which contains a quadrupole parameter @xmath7 .",
    "in spherical coordinates , it has the simple and compact expression ds^2 = & & ( 1- ) ^1+q",
    "dt^2 - ( 1- ) ^-q + & &  .",
    "[ zv ] this solution is obtained from the schwarzschild metric by applying a zipoy - voorhees transformation @xcite . in the literature , for notational reasons",
    "this solution is known as the @xmath50metric or as the @xmath51metric @xcite .",
    "instead , we propose to use the term quadrupole metric ( @xmath52metric ) to emphasize the role of the parameter @xmath7 which determines the quadrupole moment . indeed , a straightforward computation of the geroch multipole moments leads to a monopole @xmath53 and a quadrupole @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath55 , we obtain the limiting case of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "moreover , the free parameters @xmath0 and @xmath7 can be chosen in such a way that the quadrupole moment @xmath56 is negative ( oblate objects ) or positive ( prolate objects ) .",
    "furthermore , one can easily show that this solution satisfies all physical conditions mentioned in the previous section for exterior solutions .",
    "this implies that it can be used to describe the exterior gravitational field of static compact stars .",
    "a detailed analysis of the circular motion of test particles around a compact object described by the @xmath52metric shows that the presence of the quadrupole parameter can drastically change the physical behavior of test particles , and the obtained effects corroborate the interpretation of @xmath7 as determining the deviation of the mass distribution from spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "all the solutions presented in the previous section do not take into account an important characteristic of compact objects , namely , the rotation .",
    "realistic exact solutions should contain at least one additional parameter that could be interpreted as rotation . in terms of multipole moments , this means that the angular - momentum dipole should be nonzero . the first exact solution with a non - trivial angular - momentum dipole",
    "was discovered by kerr in 1963 .",
    "soon after , ernst proposed a general representation for stationary and axisymmetric vacuum and electrovacuum spacetimes that allowed researchers in this field to derive a new type of internal symmetries of the field equations . as a result",
    ", some solution generating techniques @xcite were developed whose main objective is to generate new solutions from known ones .",
    "the first generating methods such as the kerr - schild ansatz , the complex newman - janis ansatz , and the hamilton - jacobi separability procedure were limited to generate only the ( charged ) kerr - nut ( newman - unti - tamburino ) class of stationary solutions .",
    "nevertheless , the simple and compact ernst representation was used by tomimatsu and sato and yamazaki and hori to find exact solutions with a particular functional dependence for the ernst potential .",

    "all the early methods were based on particular symmetries of the field equations .",
    "the discovery of lie symmetries of the ernst representation in the late seventies determined the starting point for the development of modern solution generating techniques .",
    "all the symmetry transformations of the field equations involve in general an infinite dimensional group of transformations .",
    "one of the main difficulties was to isolate only those transformations that preserve asymptotic flatness and do not generate unphysical curvature singularities _ a priori_. finally , hoenselaers , kinnersley and xanthopoulos found subgroups of the geroch group which preserve asymptotic flatness and can easily be extrapolated by purely algebraic methods .",
    "particular cases of bcklund transformations of the ernst equations were found by harrison and neugebauer .",
    "bcklund transformations were first used to generate asymptotically flat solutions , using the minkowski metric as seed solution . in general , it can be shown that the generated solution is asymptotically flat , if this is also a property of the seed solution .",
    "a different method was proposed by belinsky and zakharov in which the nonlinear einstein field equations are represented as a linear eigenvalue problem which can be solved by means of the inverse scattering method .",
    "this method allows one to generate solitonic solutions , one of which corresponds to the kerr - nut solution .",
    "all the above methods imply several detailed procedures with quite complicated calculations .",
    "a particularly simple and different method was developed by sibgatullin @xcite in which only the value of the ernst potential on the axis of symmetry is required in order to calculate the general form of the potential from which the corresponding metric can be calculated .",
    "suppose that the ernst potential in cylindrical coordinates is given as an arbitrary function @xmath57 on the axis @xmath58 .",
    "then , the ernst potential for the entire spacetime can be calculated as e(,z ) = _ -1^+1 d  , where @xmath59 and the unknown function @xmath60 satisfies the singular integral equation _ -1^+1 d= 0  , and the normalizing condition _",

    "these solutions are characterized by a finite number of parameters which are interpreted in terms of multipoles .",
    "for instance , the most general solution of this class has six parameters and is determined on the axis by the ernst potential @xcite e(z ) =  , which contains four parameters .",
    "an additional function corresponding to the electromagnetic potential on the axis contains the two remaining parameters . in the case of vanishing electromagnetic field @xmath62 and rotation @xmath63",

    "we do not know if this is also true in the case of other quadrupolar metrics mentioned in this section .",
    "suppose , for instance , that a particular quadrupolar metric has a singularity at a distance of say @xmath90 from the center of a source with a mass of @xmath91 .",

    "the above discussion is related to the conditions that a general solution must satisfy in order to become physically meaningful .",
    "indeed , if a curvature singularity is present , it should be possible to `` cover '' it by an interior solution that can be matched with an exterior solution across the surface of the star . in our opinion ,",
    "the problem of solving the matching conditions in the presence of a physically meaningful interior solution is one of the most important challenges of modern relativistic astrophysics in general relativity .",

    "we will consider this issue in the next section .",
    "the problem of finding an interior solution for a stationary and axisymmetric spacetime is still open . even in the case of vanishing quadrupole ,",
    "the problem is still not completely solved .",
    "indeed , in the case of a perfect fluid with constant energy density , an interior schwarzschild solution can be obtained analytically , but its physical properties do not allow us to use it to describe the interior field of a spherically symmetric compact star because it violates causality , i.e. , a sound wave propagates inside the star with superluminal velocity .",
    "other spherically symmetric interior solutions are usually non - physical or can not be matched with the exterior schwarzschild metric @xcite . in the case of quadrupolar metrics ,",
    "the situation is quite similar .",
    "the only rigidly rotating perfect - fluid solution , containing the kerr spacetime in the vacuum limit , is the wahlquist metric @xcite which , however , is characterized by an unphysical equation of state @xmath94 . moreover , in the slow rotation approximation , the zero pressure surface corresponds to a prolate ellipsoid rather than an oblate ellipsoid , as expected from a physical point of view .",
    "other solutions with quadrupole represent anisotropic fluids @xcite which , however , either they do not satisfy the energy conditions @xcite or either the boundary surface of zero pressure can not be fixed because the hydrostatic pressure can not be isolated from the other stresses @xcite .",
    "all the interior solutions mentioned above have been obtained by analyzing carefully the corresponding field equations and , as we have seen , the results are not very satisfactory . in view of this situation , we believe that it is necessary to apply a different approach .",
    "we propose to develop solution generating techniques for interior spacetimes . indeed , the discovery of lie symmetries , bcklund transformations and the inverse scattering method in the ernst equations represented a radical change in the search for exterior stationary and axisymmetric solutions .",
    "we believe that a similar approach could be useful also in the case of interior solutions .    to illustrate the problem of finding interior solutions , we first consider the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes . to this end , let us consider the following line element in spherical coordinates ds^2= e^(r ) dt^2 - - r^2 ( d^2 + ^2d^2 )  .",
    "we choose a perfect fluid as the physical model for the interior gravitational field .",
    "then , einstein s equations r _ - r g _ = 8   reduce to =  , m = 4r^2  .",
    "in addition , there is a second order differential equation which is equivalent to the energy - momentum conservation law @xmath95 . in this case",
    ", it can be written as the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation = -  .",
    "we see that we have only three equations for determining four unknowns ( @xmath96 , @xmath0 , @xmath97 , and @xmath15 ) .",
    "to close the system of differential equations , it is necessary to impose an additional condition which is usually taken as the equation of state @xmath98 . in particular , one can use the barotropic equation of state @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the constant barotropic factor .",
    "many barotropic solutions are known in the literature @xcite which , however , usually are either not related to realistic equations of state or show a singular behavior at the level of the pressure or energy density . to obtain more realistic solutions ,",
    "we propose to start from a physically realistic energy density , for instance . indeed",
    ", suppose that the energy density is given _ a priori _ by the polynomial equation @xcite ( r ) = _ c - c_1 r - c_2 r^2 - c_3 r^3  , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath101 are real constants and @xmath102 is the energy density at the center of the body .",
    "then , the mass function can be integrated explicitly and we obtain m(r ) = r^3 ( 20 _ c - 15 c_1 r - 12 c_2 r^2 - 10 c_3 r^3 )  .",
    "clearly , the above particular ansatz allows us to obtain a realistic behavior for the energy density , provided the constants are chosen appropriately .",
    "for instance , at the surface of the sphere @xmath103 we demand that the energy density vanishes , @xmath104 , and so we obtain _ c = c_1 r + c_2 r^2 + c_3 r^3  , which establishes an algebraic relationship between the free constants .",
    "the mass function @xmath105 is then determined by the free constants only .",
    "moreover , we impose the physical condition that the total mass m = _ 0^r m(r ) dr coincides with the mass of the exterior schwarzschild metric which implies a boundary condition for the function @xmath106 , namely e^2(r = r ) = 1 -  .",
    "the procedure consists now in solving the differential equations for @xmath106 and @xmath107 with the boundary conditions specified above",
    ". we did not success in finding analytic solutions and , therefore , we integrate the system of differential equations numerically .",
    "to this end , it is necessary to impose additional boundary conditions as follows . at the center and at the surface of the sphere",
    ", the pressure must satisfy the boundary conditions p_r p(r ) = 0  , p(r=0)p_c <  . moreover , we demand that the pressure is a well behaved function inside the sphere , i.e. , 0 < p(r ) < 0 r r  , which means that the pressure function should be free of singularities inside the sphere .",
    "the method consists now in integrating numerically the equations for the total mass @xmath108 and for the pressure @xmath97 , under the conditions mentioned above .",
    "the goal is to find values for the constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath101 such that @xmath108 is positive and @xmath107 is positive and free of singularities .",
    "in fact , it turns out that there are several intervals of values in which all conditions are satisfied .",
    "the particular simple choice c_1 =  , c_2 =  , c_3 = with the particular radius value r=0.4 leads to boundary values _",
    "c = 0.2293  , m=0.002633  , ( r ) = - 0.0066   .",
    "then , the integration of the differential equation for the pressure is straightforward . in fig . [ fig1 ]",
    ", we illustrate the behavior of the pressure .",
    "the graphic shows that everywhere inside the sphere , the pressure has a very physical and realistic behavior .    .",
    "all the conditions for the pressure to be physically meaningful are satisfied . ]",
    "the corresponding function for the energy density shows also a physical behavior as demanded _ a priori _ with the polynomial ansatz and the chosen values for the constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath101 .",
    "the differential equation for the function @xmath106 can also be integrated and its behavior is represented in fig . [ fig2 ] .     for a sphere of radius @xmath109 and energy density constants @xmath110 . ]",
    "it can be seen that this function is well behaved inside the sphere .",
    "moreover , the value at the boundary @xmath109 , together with the value of the total mass , matches exactly the corresponding metric function for the exterior schwarzschild solution .    an important condition that must be satisfied by any interior solution",
    "is the buchdahl limit @xcite which , in principle , can be associated with the chandrasekhar limit about the maximum mass of compact stars .",
    "an analysis of the differential equations that determine the spherically symmetric case under consideration here shows that in order to avoid unstable configurations , which could lead to a collapse of the sphere , it is necessary that the condition @xmath111 be satisfied .",
    "in fact , for a mass - to - radius ratio with @xmath112 , the gravitational collapse is imminent and the staticity condition of the mass distribution is no longer valid .",
    "so , buchdahl s limit is an essential requirement for a solution to be physically meaningful . from the boundary values",
    "obtained above , it is easy to see that this requirement is satisfied at the surface of the body .",
    "however , it could be that the behavior of the mass function inside the star violates buchdahl s limit for a specific value of the radial coordinate , leading to an internal instability . to corroborate the stable behavior inside the body , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the behavior of the mass function for all values of the radial coordinate .    .",
    "the condition @xmath113 is satisfied everywhere inside the sphere . ]",
    "we can see that inside the sphere the mass - to - radius ratio is everywhere less than the limiting value @xmath114 , indicating that no instabilities can occur .",
    "this result reinforces the physical interpretation of the numerical solution presented here .",
    "the simple example for a static perfect - fluid sphere as a source of a compact star shows that it is possible to find physically meaningful solutions of the interior field equations .",
    "but it also shows that it is very difficult to integrate analytically the resulting differential equations .",
    "we started from a particular polynomial ansatz for the energy density which guarantees a meaningful physical behavior .",
    "this allows us to integrate the mass function , but the pressure and the remaining metric function @xmath106 can not be integrated analytically .",
    "a numerical analysis seems to be always necessary . for this reason",
    "we believe that the standard method of solving directly the field equations should be complemented by a solution generating technique , similar to the methods used for obtaining exterior solutions .",
    "we now turn back to the study of quadrupolar interior metrics . as mentioned above , all the known solutions are either unphysical or they can not be matched with the exterior kerr metric . to attack this problem , we propose to consider the mass quadrupole as an additional degree of freedom and to analyze the symmetry properties of the field equations in the presence of matter . to begin with ,",
    "we have considered first the case of static quadrupole metrics with a perfect fluid as the source of gravity .",
    "if we consider the spherically symmetric line element analyzed above , and try to generalize it to include the case of axisymmetric fields , it turns out to be convenient to use the following line element @xcite ds^2 = e^2 dt^2 - e^-2  , [ lel1 ] where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the einstein equations with an energy - momentum tensor represented by a perfect fluid shows that the resulting set of differential equations can be split into two systems in a manner which resembles the splitting in the case of vacuum spacetimes .",
    "indeed , the main field equations can be written as + + = p e^2- 2  , [ mu ] _ , rr + + ( + ) _ , r + = ( 3 p + ) e^2- 2  .",
    "[ psi ] moreover , the metric function @xmath14 is determined by two first order differential equations _ ,",
    "r = \\{+_,_,r-_,r _ , }  , [ gamr ] _",
    ", = \\ { + h_,r_r + _ , _ , }  , [ gamt ] where |p = p e^2- 2  .",
    "the equations for @xmath14 can be integrated by quadratures once the main field equations ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) are solved , and the pressure @xmath119 is given _ a priori _ as an independent function .",
    "notice that if we introduce the differential equations ( [ mu])-([gamt ] ) into the original einstein equations , a second order differential equation for @xmath14 is obtained _ ,",
    "rr++_,r^2 + + = |p  , [ gam2 ] which must also be satisfied .",
    "however , a straightforward computation shows that this equation is identically satisfied if the two first - order differential equations ( [ gamr ] ) and ( [ gamt ] ) for @xmath14 and the conservation equation for the parameters of the perfect fluid p_,r = -(+p)_,r  , p _ , = -(+p ) _ ,  , [ claw ] are satisfied .",
    "the conservation equations resemble the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov relation for the spherically symmetric case .",
    "we see that the particular choice of the above line element leads to a splitting of the field field equations into two separated sets of equations , and to a generalization of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equation for the case of two spatial coordinates .",
    "this is an important advantage when trying to perform the integration of the main field equations .",
    "indeed , in this manner we found a series of relatively simple approximate solutions with non - trivial quadrupole moment .",
    "the presentation and physical investigation of those solutions requires several detailed analysis which are beyond the scope of this work , and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "a byproduct of such analysis was the discovery of certain symmetries of the field equations for a perfect fluid which can be used to generate new solutions from known ones by using the procedure described below .",
    "suppose that an exact interior solution of einstein s equations ( [ mu])-([gamt ] ) for the static axisymmetric line element ( [ lel1 ] ) is given explicitly by means of the functions h_0",
    "= h_0(r ) ,  _ 0=_0(r , ) ,  _ 0=_0(r , ) ,   _ 0=_0(r , ) , [ sol ] |p_0 = |p_0(r , ) ,  |_0 = |_0(r , )  , where we have introduced the notation |p_0 = p_0 e^2_0 - 2_0  , |_0 = _ 0 e^2_0 - 2_0  , and @xmath120 and @xmath121 are also known functions .",
    "then , for any arbitrary real values of the constant parameter @xmath122 , a class of new solutions of the field equations ( [ mu])-([gamt ] ) can be obtained explicitly from the functions h = h_0(r ) ,   = _ 0(r , ) ,  = _ 0(r , ) , [ nsol ]  |p = |p_0(r , ) ,  |= |_0(r , ) ,  =  , ( r , ) = ^2 _ 0(r , ) + ( ^2 -1 ) dr + 8(1- ) dr +  , [ ngam ] where @xmath123 is an arbitrary real constant and =  .",
    "to illustrate the application of this solution generating method , let us consider the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution which describes the interior field of a perfect - fluid sphere of radius @xmath124 and total mass @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding line element can be written as ds^2 = ^2 dt^2 - - r^2(d^2 + ^2d^2 )  , with f(r)=  .",
    "the physical parameters of the perfect fluid are the constant density @xmath125 and the pressure @xmath126 , which is a function of the radial coordinate @xmath127 only p_0 = _ 0  .",
    "we now consider the interior schwarzschild metric as the seed solution ( [ sol ] ) for the general transformation ( [ nsol ] ) . a straightforward comparison with the general line element ( [ lel1 ] ) yields e^_0 = f(r ) - f(r )  ,  h_0 = r^2 f^2(r )  ,  _ 0 = r e^_0  ,  e^_0 = r e^_0  .

    "according to the procedure described above , the new solution can be obtained from eq.([schint1 ] ) by multiplying the corresponding metric functions with the new parameter @xmath122 .",

    "this is clearly not a barotropic equation of state since the seed pressure @xmath126 depends explicitly on the radial coordinate @xmath127 .",
    "nevertheless , it can be interpreted as a generalized barotropic equation of state @xmath128 .",
    "interestingly , the physical parameters of the perfect fluid are axisymmetric , but the equation of state preserves spherical symmetry in the sense that the generalized barotropic factor depends on the radial coordinate only .    notice that the new function @xmath14 depends explicitly on the new coordinate @xmath129 , in contrast to the seed metric function @xmath130 which depends on the radial coordinate @xmath127 only .",
    "this proves that the new solution is not spherically symmetric , but axisymmetric .",
    "notice also that the density and pressure of the new solution are functions of the angular coordinate too , as expected for an axisymmetric mass distribution .",
    "it is expected that the obtained deviations from spherical symmetry are related to the quadrupole moment of the perfect fluid ; however , a more detailed investigation is necessary to define an interior quadrupole which should be related to the exterior quadrupole .",
    "this is a task for future works .",
    "in this work , we presented a review of the problem of describing the interior and exterior gravitational field of compact objects in general relativity , which include black holes and compact stars ( white dwarfs and neutron stars ) . to take into account rotation and deformation of the mass distribution , we consider stationary and axisymmetric solutions of einstein s equations with quadrupole moment .",
    "we formulate the physical conditions which , in our opinion , should be satisfied by a riemannian manifold in order to represent the interior and exterior gravitational field of compact objects .    we review the main static solutions in which the quadrupole is represented by a free parameter .",
    "we argue that the @xmath52metric represents the simplest generalization of the schwarzschild solution with a quadrupole parameter .",

    "we argue that the interior counterpart of the exterior kerr metric can not be found in general relativity because it is directly related to a curvature singularity at which the classical theory breaks down .",
    "probably , a quantum description of gravity is necessary in order to understand the interior field of a black hole . in the case of compact stars , however , we argue that general relativity should allow the existence of spacetimes which describe both the interior and exterior gravitational field . in view of the precarious situation regarding physically meaningful interior solutions",
