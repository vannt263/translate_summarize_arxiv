    "the spin - orbit torque ( sot ) is a recently discovered phenomenon  @xcite in ferromagnet / heavy - metal ( f / hm ) lateral heterostructures involves unpolarized charge current injected parallel to the f / hm interface induces switching or steady - state precession  @xcite of magnetization in the f overlayer . unlike conventional spin - transfer torque ( stt ) in spin valves and magnetic tunnel junction ( mtjs ) ,  @xcite where one f layer acts as spin - polarizer of electrons that transfer torque to the second f layer when its free magnetization is noncollinear to the direction of incoming spins , heterostructures exhibiting sot use a _ single _ f layer .",
    "thus , in f / hm bilayers , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) at the interface or in the bulk of the hm layer is crucial to spin - polarized injected current via the edelstein effect ( ee )  @xcite or the spin hall effect ( she ) ,  @xcite respectively .",
    "and @xmath0 is the unit vector along its free magnetization .",
    "the ti layer is attached to two n leads which are semi - infinite in the @xmath3-direction and terminate into macroscopic reservoirs .",
    "we also assume that f and ti layers , as well as n leads , are infinite in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "the unpolarized charge current is injected by the electrochemical potential difference between the left and the right macroscopic reservoirs which sets the bias voltage , @xmath5 .",
    "we mention that the results do not change if the ti surface is covered by the f overlayer partially or fully . ]",
    "the sot offers potentially more efficient magnetization switching than achieved by using mtjs underlying present stt - magnetic random access memories ( stt - mram ) .",
    "@xcite thus , substantial experimental and theoretical efforts have been focused on identifying physical mechanisms behind sot whose understanding would pave the way to maximize its value by using optimal materials combinations .",
    "for example , very recent experiments  @xcite have replaced hm with three - dimensional topological insulators ( 3d tis ) .",
    "@xcite the tis enhance  @xcite ( by a factor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fermi velocity on the surface of ti and @xmath8 is the rashba soc strength  @xcite at the f / hm interface ) the transverse nonequilibrium spin density driven by the longitudinal charge current , which is responsible for the large _ field - like _ sot component  @xcite observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite    furthermore , recent experiments have also observed antidamping - like sot in f / ti heterostructures with surprisingly large figure of merit ( i.e. , antidamping torque per unit applied charge current density ) that surpasses  @xcite those measured in a variety of f / hm heterostructures .",
    "this component competes against the gilbert damping which tries to restore magnetization to equilibrium , and its large figure of merit is , therefore , of particular importance for increasing efficiency of magnetization switching .",
    "theoretical understanding of the physical origin of antidamping - like sot is crucial to resolve the _",
    "key challenge _ for anticipated applications of sot generated by tis ",
    "demonstration of magnetization switching of the f overlayer at room temperature ( thus far , magnetization switching has been demonstrated only at cryogenic temperature  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the microscopic mechanism behind its large magnitude  @xcite and ability to efficiently ( i.e. , using as little dc current density as possible ) switch magnetization  @xcite remains under scrutiny .",
    "for example , ti samples used in these experiments are often unintentionally doped , so that bulk charge carriers can generate antidamping - like sot via rather large  @xcite she ( but not sufficient to explain all reported values  @xcite ) . the simplistic picture ,  @xcite in which electrons spin - polarized by the ee diffuse into the f overlayer  @xcite to deposit spin angular momentum within it , can not operate in technologically relevant f overlayers of nm thickness  @xcite or explain complex angular dependence  @xcite typically observed for sot .",
    "the berry curvature mechanism  @xcite for antidamping - like sot applied to lateral f / ti heterostructures predicts its peculiar dependence on the magnetization orientation ,  @xcite vanishing when magnetization @xmath0 is parallel to the f / ti interface .",
    "this feature has thus far not been observed experimentally ,  @xcite and , furthermore , it makes such antidamping - like sot less efficient  @xcite ( by requiring larger injected currents to initiate magnetization switching ) than standard she - driven  @xcite antidamping - like sot .",
    "we note that the recent experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies of sot in lateral f / ti bilayer have focused on the geometry where an infinite f overlayer covers an infinite ti layer .",
    "moreover , they assume  @xcite purely two - dimensional transport where only the top surface of the ti layer is explicitly taken into account by the low - energy effective ( dirac ) hamiltonian supplemented by the zeeman term due to the magnetic proximity effect . on the other hand , transport in realistic ti - based heterostructures",
    "is always three - dimensional , with _",
    "unpolarized _ electrons being injected from normal metal contacts , reflected from the f / ti edge to flow along the surface of the ti in the @xmath9-plane and then along the bottom ti surface in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "in fact , electrons also flow within a thin layer ( of thickness @xmath10 nm in bi@xmath11se@xmath12 as the prototypical ti material ) underneath the top and bottom surfaces due to top and bottom metallic surfaces of the ti doping the bulk via evanescent wave functions .",
    "@xcite therefore , in this study we consider more realistic and experimentally relevant  @xcite f / ti bilayer geometries , illustrated in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] , where the ti layer of finite length @xmath13 and finite thickness @xmath14 is ( partially or fully ) covered by the f overlayer of length @xmath15 .",
    "the two semi - infinite ideal n leads are directly attached to the ti layer .",
    "we should mention that the result does not depend on the length of ti layer that is covered by the fm .",
    "our principal results are twofold and are summarized as follows :    ( _ i _ ) _ theoretical prediction for sot : _ we predict that the geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] will generate large antidamping - like sot per low injected charge current . by studying spatial dependence of the sot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) , we show that in a clean fm / ti interface the electrons exert anti - damping torque on the fm as they enter into the interface and unless interfacial roughness or impurities are included the torque remains mainly concentrated around the edge of the interface .",
    "although the exact results show strong nonperturbative features , based on second order perturbation we present two different interpretations showing that the origin of the antidamping sot relies on the spin - flip reflection of the chiral electrons injected into the fm / ti interface . its strong angular dependence ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) , i.e. , dependence on the magnetization direction @xmath0 , offers a unique signature that can be used to distinguish it from other possible physical mechanisms . by numerically solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation in the macrospin approximation ,",
    "we demonstrate ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] and  [ fig : fig6 ] ) that the obtained sot is capable of switching of a single domain magnetization of a perpendicularly magnetized f overlayer with bias voltage in the oder of the magneto - crystaline anisotropy ( mca ) energy .",

    "the negf - based formula for sot naturally splits into four components , determined by their behavior ( even or odd ) under the time and bias voltage reversal .",
    "this gives us a general framework in quantum mechanics to analyze the dissipative ( antidamping - like ) and nondissipative ( field - like ) force ( torque ) vector fields for a set of canonical variables ( magnetization directions ) .",
    "their angular ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) and spatial ( see fig .  [",

    "this is evident in the angular dependence of the anti - damping torque which in the current section is considered up to second order effect ( @xmath155 ) , while the divergence - like behavior in figs.[fig : fig2](h ) suggest a linear dependence when the magnetization direction is close to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "this signifies the importance of the higher order terms with respect to @xmath125 that can not be ignored .",
    "the approximation presented in this section also suggests that blocking the lower surface leads to the reduction of the anti - damping torque .",
    "however , in this case an electron experiences multiple spin - flip reflections before transmitting to the next lead and in fact it turns out that the exact results stay intact even if the lower surface is blocked .",
    "this is similar to the conclusion made in ref .   which shows the redundancy of blocking the lower edge of the 2d - ti to obtain a nonzero pumped charge current from precessing fm as proposed in ref .",
    "although spin - momentum locking of the surface state of the ti resembles the 2d rashba plane , in the case of ti surface state the cones with opposite spin - momentum locking reside on opposite surface sides of the ti slab while in the case of a rashba plane they are only separated by the soc energy .",
    "this means one can expect a smaller sot for a fm on top of a 2d rashba plane due to cancellation of the effects of the two circles with opposite spin - momentum locking , where the nonzero anti - damping torque originates from the electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "in order to investigate ability of predicted antidamping - like sot to switch the magnetization direction of a perpendicularly magnetized f overlayer in the geometry of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] , we study magnetization dynamics in the macrospin approximation by numerically solving llg equation at zero temperature supplemented by sot components analyzed in sec .  [",

    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the magnetization trajectories for all possible initial conditions @xmath150 on the unit sphere under different @xmath63 . at @xmath161 , the two attractors are located as the north and south poles of the sphere . at finite @xmath63 , the attractors shift away from the poles along the @xmath126-axis within the @xmath162-plane , while additional attractor appears on the positive ( negative ) @xmath4-axis under negative ( positive ) @xmath63 .",
    "note that the applied bias voltage @xmath63 drives dc current and sot proportional to it in the assumed linear - response transport regime .     as a function of an in - plane external magnetic @xmath163 and @xmath63 ( i.e. , sot @xmath164 ) .",
    "thick arrows on each of the panels ( a)(d ) show the direction of sweeping of @xmath165 or @xmath63 parameter .",
    "the smallness of central hysteretic region along the @xmath63-axis , enclosed by white dashed line in panel ( b ) and ( d ) , shows that low currents are required to switch magnetization from @xmath166 to @xmath167 stable states . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6 ] shows the commonly constructed  @xcite phase diagram of the magnetization state in the presence of an external in - plane magnetic field @xmath163 and the applied bias voltage @xmath63 ( i.e. , sot @xmath164 ) .",

    "[ fig : fig6](c ) [ [ fig : fig6](d ) ] we increase [ decrease ] the external magnetic field gradually .",
    "the size of hysteretic region in the center of these diagrams , enclosed by white dashed line in figs .  [ fig : fig6](b ) and  [ fig : fig6](d ) , measures the efficiency of switching .",
    "@xcite since this region , where both magnetization states @xmath166 and @xmath167 are allowed , is relatively small in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) and  [ fig : fig6](b ) , magnetization can be switched by low @xmath168 and small @xmath63 ( or , equivalently , small injected dc current ) , akin to the phase diagrams observed in recent experiments .  @xcite    although we considered the fm a single domain , the fact that the anti - damping component of the sot is mainly peaked around the edge of the fm / ti interface suggests that it is be more feasible in realistic cases to have the local magnetic moments at the edge of the fm switch first and then the total magnetization switches by the propagation of the domain walls formed at the edge throughout the fm  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a micromagnetic simulation of the system is required to investigate switching phenomena in large size systems which we relegate to future works .",
    "in conclusion , by performing adiabatic expansion of time - dependent negfs ,  @xcite we have developed a framework which yields formulas for spin torque and charge pumping as reciprocal effects to each other connected by time - reversal , as well as gilbert damping due to soc .",
    "it also introduces a novel way to separate the sot components , based on their behavior ( even or odd ) under time and bias voltage reversal , and can be applied to arbitrary systems dealing with classical degrees of freedom coupled to electrons out of equilibrium . for the geometry  @xcite",
    "proposed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where the f overlayer covers ( either partially or fully ) the top surface of the ti layer , we predict that low charge current flowing solely on the surface of ti will induce antidamping - like sot on the f overlayer via a physical mechanism that requires spin - momentum locking on the surface of tis  spin - flip reflection at the lateral edges of a ferromagnetic island introduced by magnetic proximity effect onto the ti surface .",
    "this mechanism has been overlooked in efforts to understand why so - coupled interface alone ( i.e. , in the absence of she current from the bulk of so - coupled non - ferromagnetic materials ) can generate antidamping - like sot , where other explored mechanisms have included spin - dependent impurity scattering at the interface ,  @xcite berry curvature mechanism ,  @xcite as well as their combination .",
    "@xcite    the key feature for connecting experimentally observed sot and other related phenomena in f / ti heterostructures ( such as spin - to - charge conversion  @xcite ) to theoretical predictions is their dependence  @xcite on the magnetization direction .",
    "the antidamping - like sot predicted in our study exhibits complex angular dependence , exhibiting `` nonperturbative '' change with the magnetization direction in fig .",
