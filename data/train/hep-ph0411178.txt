    "recent years have seen remarkable progress in flavor physics .",
    "the dramatic discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite , long suspected to be the explanation for the solar neutrino deficit , is the first firm evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the quark sector , @xmath4-violation was discovered in the neutral kaon system  @xcite in agreement with observed indirect cp violation and the cpt theorem .",
    "the first example of direct cp violation was also discovered in the neutral kaon system  @xcite . finally ,",
    "both indirect and direct cp violation have been observed for the first time in another system , in the decays @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively  @xcite .",
    "the data confirms that the cp violation observed to date originates in the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( km ) phase of the quark mixing matrix .",
    "it is incredible that all of this has been accomplished in a six - year period !",
    "however , the origin of flavor and patterns of masses and mixings still remain elusive .",
    "interestingly , a deviation from the km theory has been reported in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the time - dependent cp - asymmetries in these modes , denoted @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , yield an effective value of @xmath11 that differs from that in the @xmath12 final state .. for more details see  @xcite . ] the averages of belle and babar  @xcite are , according to  @xcite : @xmath13 which should be compared to @xmath14 the discrepancy is @xmath15 for the @xmath16 mode , and the two modes show values consistent with each other . at babar and belle  @xcite . ]",
    "the evidence for a new source of cp violation is not yet conclusive .",
    "nonetheless , many new physics models have been shown to contribute significantly to the cp violation in @xmath17 transitions within the limits from other experimental constraints .",
    "for example , the observed large mixing between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , once grand - unified , can lead to a large mixing between @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "there is a growing excitement to see if such new physics scenarios can account for the observed difference between @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "the fact that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are similar yields information about the operators responsible for the deviation from @xmath22 , and hence a hint as to the underlying new physics .",
    "contributions to @xmath23 decays proceed through effective operators of two types , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for definitions of the relevant operators ) .",
    "the standard model contributes only to `` left - handed '' ( lh ) operators @xmath24 , while some new physics scenarios , such as mixing between right - handed squarks , only contribute to the `` right - handed '' ( rh ) operators @xmath25 .",
    "several groups  @xcite have made the observation that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the parity of the final state .",
    "since @xmath28 is parity odd ( a pseudoscalar and vector in a @xmath29-wave state ) while @xmath30 is parity even ( two pseudoscalars in an @xmath31-wave state ) , these two final states will be sensitive to different combinations of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 operators .    in  @xcite it",
    "is claimed that the recent measurements of the cp - asymmetries @xmath9 and @xmath10 imply that the additional cp - violating phases appear in the mixing of left - handed squarks and not right - handed squarks .",
    "here we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case . because of the two - fold ambiguity in the extraction of the weak phase from @xmath9 and @xmath10 , right - handed operators with a single new cp phase can successfully account for the observed discrepancies .",
    "the preferred parameter region is more tightly constrained than that for the opposite chirality , but this allows for a more precise study of correlations with other observables such as @xmath3 mixing and @xmath32 .",
    "thus we may be able to test this scenario in the near future .",
    "we are interested in a scenario in which the new physics contribution is dominated by right - handed operators with a single source of cp violation . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we will comment on the role of strong phases , but for simplicity we shall begin by assuming that all strong phases are negligible . in that case",
    "the amplitude for the @xmath23-meson decay can be written @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the weak phase of the rh operators and @xmath35 it is known that the matrix elements for @xmath23 decays normalized to the sm contributions are similar for the final states @xmath28 and @xmath36  @xcite , so as a first approximation we will assume that they are in fact identical .",
    "this means @xmath37 we will use this approximation for our general analysis , but will come back to discuss deviations from this assumption in section  [ sec : realistic ] .",
    "the mixing induced cp asymmetry is given by @xmath38 where the second factor is the @xmath39 mixing , and the third factor is the @xmath40 mixing . using equation  ( [ amp ] ) and assuming the sm contribution is purely real we find @xmath41 where @xmath42    it is useful to first consider the two interesting limits of small and large @xmath43 . for small @xmath43",
    "we find @xmath44 since the measured @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both smaller than @xmath45 , it is clear that a single rh operator can not account for the data when @xmath43 is small . on the other hand , when @xmath43 is large we find @xmath46 which naturally leads to deviations for @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the same direction .",
    "in reality we expect that @xmath43 will lie somewhere between these two extremes . but",
    "studying these limits shows that rh operators require sizeable new physics contributions ( @xmath47 ) to account for the data .",
    "this contrasts with the case of lh operators where new physics contributions can be as small as @xmath48 .",
    "we can analyze the situation more precisely by plotting @xmath9 and @xmath10 as functions of @xmath43 and @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhcontour ] shows the central value and one - sigma contours of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the bands overlap in the two regions around @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that a single rh operator _ can _ account for the experimental results , despite the claim in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , since there are only two discrete regions that are consistent with the data , we can hope to find strong correlations with other observables .",
    "( blue ) and @xmath10 ( pink ) for a rh new physics contribution as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath51 . ]    for comparison , in figure  [ fig : lhcontour ] we show the same contours but this time assuming the new physics contribution comes from lh operators . as expected ,",
    "since there is no longer a relative sign difference between the new physics contributions to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the overlap regions are much larger .",
    "thus a wider range of parameters is consistent with the data , but that also means less information can be extracted .",
    "the difference between figures  [ fig : rhcontour ] and  [ fig : lhcontour ] is what led to the the conclusion in  @xcite that new physics contributions to lh operators are favored , but we clearly see that contributions from rh operators are not excluded yet , especially if one considers the @xmath52 allowed regions , which are shown in figure  [ fig:2sigma ] .",
    "( blue ) and @xmath10 ( pink ) for a lh new physics contribution as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath51 . ]     ( blue ) and @xmath10 ( pink ) for a rh new physics contribution as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath51 . ]",
    "these remaining allowed regions for rh operators are important because flavor violation from new degrees of freedom is aligned with that of the sm in many simple flavor models such as abelian  @xcite and non - abelian  @xcite horizontal models , split fermion models  @xcite and rs1 models  @xcite .",
    "this implies the following relation between the quark masses and left and right diagonalization matrices @xmath53 of the down type yukawa matrix : @xmath54 which implies @xmath55 thus we generically expect new physics to induce rh operators which are not suppressed by @xmath56 and therefore might yield the dominant contribution . also , constraints from some measurements such as @xmath57 are weaker for rh operators because the lh contributions add coherently to the sm whereas rh contributions add incoherently .",
    "the reason our conclusion differs from the one presented in  @xcite is that we rely on the discrete ambiguities in the sine function . in the presence of new physics contributions we can parameterize the @xmath58 asymmetries as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the phase coming from the decay amplitude .",
    "there are two solutions to equation  ( [ eqn : sigma ] ) , namely @xmath61 and @xmath62 where in the second line of each solution we have used the rough approximation @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as argued above , for a rh operator to give a contribution such that @xmath65 we would need @xmath66 , which would likely already",
    "have been observed .",
    "thus we are led to consider a mixed scenario , which means we expect solutions centered around @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "this agrees with the numbers one extracts from the regions of overlap in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhcontour ] .",
    "in the previous section we have analyzed the situation where the size of the new physics amplitude relative to the sm is the same for both the @xmath28 and @xmath30 final states .",
    "this assumption can be checked using a specific hadronic model . within the framework of naive factorization we found that @xmath69 for the relevant operators .",
    "for instance the chromomagnetic operator , which often gives the dominant contribution , yields @xmath70 , demonstrating that this assumption is reasonable .",
    "we can relax the assumption in equation  ( [ rassum ] ) but still assume that the new physics is governed by a single source of cp violation .",
    "in this situation we expect order one variations between @xmath71 and @xmath72 . and @xmath72 are within a factor of 2 over most of the parameter space . ] to demonstrate the effect of variations of @xmath43 , we plot contours of @xmath9 and @xmath10 as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath71 with @xmath73 ( figure  [ fig : rhcontour2 ] ) and @xmath74 ( figure  [ fig : rhcontourhalf ] ) .",
    "these figures show that , despite the shift in the contours , regions of overlap still remain where rh operators can account for the deviations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 from @xmath22 , even when @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , for lh operators the overlap of the contours starts to separate when @xmath76 as shown in figures  [ fig : lhcontour2 ] and  [ fig : lhcontourhalf ] .",
    "this demonstrates that the ease with which the lh operators can fit the data is dependent on the similarity between the relative size of new physics contributions to @xmath28 and @xmath30 final states .    in reality",
    "there are further complications .",
    "the presence of strong phases that differ for @xmath28 and @xmath30 final states will generally lead to different dependence on @xmath34 , reducing the strong correlations between the two modes .",
    "also , the absorptive part of the @xmath77 loop needs to be taken into consideration , which introduces another strong phase .",
    "the situation is less clear - cut if there are multiple new cp phases in the new physics sector .",
    "finally , the uncertainties in hadronic matrix elements will always add further complication . eventually all of these subtleties must be addressed , but at this early stage of the analysis it is important to study the general features and see how far that will take us .

    "let us continue with our assumption that new physics contributions are dominated by a single source of cp violation which appears only in the rh operators .",
    "this implies that we can parameterize the contribution to the @xmath80 transition amplitude , @xmath81 , as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ratio of new physics to sm contributions , and @xmath34 is the same phase that appears in equation  ( [ amp ] ) for the @xmath84 decays . in principle",
    "@xmath83 could be quite large , though we expect it to be order one in most models .",
    "note also that the sign of @xmath83 is model dependent , so in our analysis below we consider both positive and negative values . with this parameterization",
    "the mass difference between @xmath85 and @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 so far experiments have only yielded a lower bound on the value of the mass difference , @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "the sm prediction of @xmath89 has significant hadronic uncertainties , but a much cleaner prediction is available for the ratio @xmath90 since the new physics contribution to @xmath91 transitions is very tightly constrained by current measurements  @xcite , we will assume that @xmath92 consequently we can use the state of the art analysis  @xcite and equation  ( [ dmsnp ] ) to find the following relation between the predicted ratio for @xmath93 and the experimental lower bound on @xmath94 @xmath95 with a 20% uncertainty coming from the ckm factors .",
    "here @xmath96  @xcite is related to the ratio between the bag parameters and @xmath97 .",
    "equation  ( [ delmscon ] ) provides a constraint on the allowed values of @xmath83 and @xmath34 .",
    "the constraint is , at present , rather weak and corresponds to several oval excluded regions shown in figure [ fig : dmsphi ] .",
    "examining the regions of intersection for the 1-sigma contours in figure  [ fig : rhcontour ] , we find the following range for @xmath34 preferred by @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath98 this corresponds to the two vertical strips shown in figure  [ fig : dmsphi ] . at present the regions excluded by the lower bound on @xmath89 partially intersect with the regions preferred by @xmath9 and @xmath10 only for negative values of @xmath83 .",
    "however , in the near future measurements at the tevatron , lhc - b , and btev will either measure @xmath89 or significantly raise the lower bound , so the above constraint will play an important role in discriminating between new physics frameworks .",
    "the requirements on @xmath34 from @xmath9 and @xmath10 are correlated with the prediction for @xmath32 , the cp asymmetry in @xmath99 . within the standard model , @xmath100 , so any cp - asymmetry will only arise from the new phase in the contribution to @xmath3 mixing shown in equation  ( [ m12s ] ) . thus we find @xmath101 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{h_s\\sin 2\\sigma_s}{\\sqrt{(1+h_s\\cos 2\\sigma_s)^2 + ( h_s\\sin 2\\sigma_s)^2}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : psiphi ] shows the allowed values for @xmath32 as a function of @xmath83 when @xmath34 is in the range specified by equation  ( [ sigsbound ] ) .",
    "in addition , the regions excluded by the lower bound on @xmath89 are also shown .",
    "already we see some very non - trivial correlations between measurements of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath32 that will only get stronger as the data improve .",
    "plane showing the regions excluded by the lower bound on @xmath89 ( red ovals ) and also the regions preferred by @xmath9 and @xmath10 as given in equation  ( [ sigsbound ] ) ( green bands ) . ]     as a function of @xmath83 ( green ) and the regions excluded by the lower bound on @xmath102 ( red ) .",
    "the upper plot corresponds to @xmath103 $ ] while the lower plot corresponds to @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the ranges for @xmath34 are those compatible with the measured values of @xmath9 and @xmath10.,title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of @xmath83 ( green ) and the regions excluded by the lower bound on @xmath102 ( red ) .",

    "the ranges for @xmath34 are those compatible with the measured values of @xmath9 and @xmath10.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "so far we have assumed that all strong phases are negligible . in the framework of naive factorization this is expected .",
    "however , there is now some evidence to the contrary due to the observation of direct @xmath58-violation in the decay @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "the presence of large strong phases , which should generically be different for @xmath28 and @xmath30 final states , complicate the analysis and make it more sensitive to the framework used to estimate the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "when the new physics contribution is large one would generically expect to measure direct @xmath58-violation .",
    "currently the experimental limits are @xmath106 and @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "using isospin symmetry one finds much stronger constraints from measurements of the cp asymmetries , @xmath108 , in the charged modes @xmath109 . using the world averages one finds  @xcite @xmath110",
    "nevertheless , there is significant uncertainty in this constraint , especially if @xmath111 . in the future ,",
    "if the bounds on the direct @xmath58-asymmetries improve they will limit the size of the strong phases compatible with rh new physics .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of lh contributions where @xmath43 generically need not be as big , reducing the sensitivity to measurements of direct @xmath58-violation .",
    "depending on the specific operators involved , there are many other constraints and correlations that can be studied . for instance , if the chromomagnetic dipole operator is the dominant source of new physics , there will also likely be a large contribution to the electromagnetic dipole operator responsible for the decay @xmath112 .",
    "however , in this case it has been shown that there can be a significant contribution to @xmath9 without violating the @xmath57 constraint  @xcite .",
    "another stringent constraint comes from the limit on the chromoelectric dipole moment of the strange quark derived from experimental limits on the edms of the neutron and @xmath113hg  @xcite .",
    "other constraints like @xmath114 are starting to become important as well .",
    "of course , for any specific framework all available constraints need to be studied , but such model dependent issues are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we have studied a generic framework in which new physics contributions only induce right - handed operators with a single cp violating phase .",
    "this assumption leads to the following interesting consequences :    * despite the opposite parity of the @xmath28 and @xmath30 final states , rh operators can still account for the experimental data thanks to the two - fold ambiguity in @xmath115 . *",
    "the favored parameter region is more tightly constrained for rh operators than for lh operators , and sizable new physics contributions comparable in size to the sm are required . *",
    "the ease with which lh operators can accommodate @xmath9 and @xmath10 is diminished when there are significant differences between relative size of new physics contributions to the two modes . *",
    "fitting the data with rh operators efficiently constrains the new physics phase .",
    "thus we find that the cp - asymmetries in @xmath116 are correlated with observables from the @xmath80 system such as @xmath89 and the cp asymmetry in @xmath117 .",
    "work is underway to test the viability of this scenario in the framework of a specific model of rh squark mixing , where the constraints such as @xmath57 , @xmath118 and the edm of @xmath113hg can also be imposed .",
    "we conclude that it is too early to rule out the contributions from right - handed operators to the cp - asymmetries in @xmath2 transitions .",

    "<S> current data on cp violation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , taken literally , suggest new physics contributions in @xmath2 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> despite a claim to the contrary , we point out that right - handed operators with a single weak phase can account for both deviations thanks to the two - fold ambiguity in the extraction of the weak phase from the corresponding cp - asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is welcome since large mixing in the right - handed sector is favored by many gut models and frameworks which address the flavor puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> there are also interesting correlations with the @xmath3 system which provide a way to test this scenario in the near future . </S>"
