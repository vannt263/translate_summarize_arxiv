    "are explicitly coupled by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite ; this models collisions with gas atoms that provide both frictional drag and random kicks . however , besides random kicks from gas atoms , in dusty plasma there are some additional heating mechanisms arising from ion flow , particle charge fluctuations  @xcite , and sometimes external laser manipulation @xcite that are not explicitly modeled in our langevin simulations .",
    "in addition to our langevin md simulations which include friction , to obtain results in the frictionless limit , we also performed frictionless equilibrium md simulations @xcite .",

    "second , we test whether the self - isf can serve as a sensitive indicator of the phase transition between solid and liquid .    in this paper",
    ", relaxation refers to the decay of the self - isf , @xmath12 , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the relaxation rate in general depends on the scale length , which is parameterized here by @xmath49 . using the terminology of other users of the self - isf @xcite",
    ", the early stage of decay is termed @xmath18 relaxation ; during this early time particles are mainly trapped within their cages formed by nearest neighbors .",
    "the later stage is termed @xmath19 relaxation , and this corresponds to diffusion as particles decage .",
    "the term `` decaging '' refers to a particle s movement so that it is no longer trapped by the previous nearest neighbors . in a liquid , particles decage much more rapidly than in a solid , so that this @xmath18 relaxation is much faster in liquids than solids .",
    "results from our langevin simulations are presented in fig . 2 for typical liquid conditions far from the phase transition .",
    "curves are shown as functions of time for various values of @xmath48 .",

    "this decay is the signature of relaxation .",

    "the lack of a plateau in the time - variation of the self - isf is similar to what is seen in granular flows @xcite , but different from what is expected for supercooled liquids and glasses ( cf .",
    "fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "to help quantify the relaxation that is observed in fig .  2 , we fit the time - dependence of the self - isf to the empirical form eq .",
    "( [ s - exponential ] ) .",

    "( [ s - exponential ] ) fits our simulation data points well ( shown as solid lines in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the two free parameters for the fit , @xmath21 and @xmath50 , help quantify the relaxation process .",

    "we develop two tools for identifying anomalous diffusion .",
    "previous investigators have usually used the msd , looking for a scaling with time that differs from the msd @xmath51 scaling expected for normal diffusion @xcite . for 2d systems ,",
    "data are typically fit to the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the case of normal diffusion , @xmath54 is superdiffusion , and @xmath55 is subdiffusion .",
    "( this use of the symbol @xmath19 has no relation to the @xmath19 relaxation mentioned above . ) here we introduce two other tools that are also based on how random motion develops with time : the scaling with @xmath56 vs. @xmath48 , and the value of @xmath18 .",
    "recall that @xmath56 and @xmath18 are the fitting parameters for eq .",
    "( [ s - exponential ] ) .",
    "our first new tool is the power - law scaling of the fitting parameter @xmath56 as compared to @xmath48 . to do this",

    "( [ selfisf - diffusion ] ) to allow for anomalous diffusion .",

    "( [ selfisf ] ) , previous authors @xcite have demonstrated that @xmath57 where we have substituted @xmath58 in place of @xmath59 in the denominator for two dimensions instead of three .",
    "next , we substitute eq .",
    "( [ msd ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ selfisf - diffusion2 ] ) , yielding @xmath60 examining the argument on the right - hand - side reveals the scaling @xmath61 in the case of normal diffusion , @xmath53 , the scaling is @xmath62 , as previous authors have noted @xcite . here",
    ", we note that the superdiffusion case @xmath54 has @xmath56 varying with a lesser power .",
    "thus , the signature of superdiffusion will be a slope weaker than @xmath63 when @xmath56 is plotted vs. @xmath48 using log - log axes .",
    "similarly , a slope stronger than @xmath63 in the same @xmath64 plot is the signature of subdiffusion .",
    "our second new tool is the fitting parameter @xmath18 for the self - isf . comparing eq .",
    "( [ s - exponential ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ selfisf - diffusion - general ] ) , we see that the value of @xmath18 is essentially the same as @xmath19 .",
    "the only difference is that when using actual data , the value of @xmath18 is generated by a fit , while @xmath19 is generated by examining a log - log plot . the community of scientists who use the self - isf traditionally uses @xmath18 , although until now it has not been used as an indicator of superdiffusion .",
    "scientists who use msd to characterize superdiffusion , on the other hand , traditionally use @xmath19 .",
    "the two new diagnostic tools we described above may be useful for experiments in other fields where measurements allow one to obtain the self - isf . while methods exist to distinguish anomalous diffusion from normal diffusion ( using msd , pdf , or vacf ) if particle tracking is feasible , as in dusty plasma experiments  @xcite and md simulations @xcite , other methods are needed when tracking is impossible .",
    "for example in a simple liquid , the motion of individual molecules can not be tracked , but the self - isf can be obtained using dynamic light scattering  @xcite or some other spectroscopic methods @xcite .",
    "thus , the two diagnostic tools presented above could find an application in such experiments .      for the conditions of a liquid",
    "far from the phase transition , we use our two tools ( scaling of @xmath56 vs. @xmath48 and the value of @xmath18 ) to test for anomalous diffusion .",
    "we use our two md simulations , langevin and frictionless .",
    "ott and bonitz @xcite previously varied the values of friction @xmath41 and observation time over wide ranges , and using the msd method prepared a diagram showing the conditions that favor normal diffusion or superdiffusion .",
    "this diagram , fig .",
    "3 of @xcite , predicts that the value of @xmath41 which we use in our langevin simulation will yield normal diffusion , while the @xmath65 case of our frictionless simulation will yield superdiffusion over any reasonable observation time .",
    "here we test whether our two cases , analyzed using our two new tools , yield the same conclusion as in @xcite .    for the @xmath56 vs. @xmath48 scaling , in fig .",
    "3(a ) we find the scaling @xmath62 for the langevin md simulations , and the scaling of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for the frictionless md simulations .",
    "in other words , random motion is diffusive for our frictional ( langevin ) case , but superdiffusive for our frictionless case .",
    "this is in quantitative agreement with fig .  3 of @xcite , prepared using msd curves , which demonstrated that friciton can inhibit superdiffusion @xcite .    for @xmath18",
    "3(b ) we find values near unity for our langevin simulation , but a value definitely @xmath68 for the frictionless simulation , for moderate values of @xmath48 .",
    "this is again consistent with the conclusion of diffusive motion for our frictional ( langevin ) case , but superdiffusive motion for the frictionless case . at extremely small or large values of @xmath48",
    ", however , @xmath18 can be different .",
    "figure  3(b ) reveals an overall trend for @xmath18 to increase with @xmath48 , especially at extremely small or large values of @xmath48 .",
    "previous authors @xcite have identified dynamic heterogeneities as the cause for @xmath69 for very small @xmath48 , i.e. , very large length scales . for large @xmath48 , previous authors have not reported enhanced values of @xmath18 like those we see in fig .",
    "one possible interpretation of our large @xmath48 observation is that , at these short length scales , the self - isf is affected more by caging motion than by random walks associated with decaging .    to summarize , we find that the relaxation of the self - isf is a sensitive indicator to distinguish anomalous diffusion from normal diffusion .",
    "the indication can be made using either of the two fitting parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath18 .",
    "simulation studies of the solid - liquid phase transition , which is also called an order - disorder transition or melting , are generally done using measures of static structural order , such as defects or correlation functions of particle position or bond orientation @xcite .",
    "dynamical measures can provide additional information that can be helpful for identifying a phase .",
    "temperature is kind of dynamical measure for random motion , and so is the self - isf .",
    "our first goal , for phase transitions , is to test the use of the self - isf as an indicator of the phase transition .",
    "we perform tests that indicate that it is sensitive in distinguishing solids and liquids near the phase transition .",
    "this development is useful because the self - isf is based on dynamics rather than structure .",
    "our second goal is to determine what role friction plays in the phase transition .",
    "we will vary temperature and density , using the normalized quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and we will also vary the friction @xmath41 , to determine whether the self - isf is sensitive to phases , and what role friction plays .      we find that the self - isf time series undergoes a sudden change at the melting point .",
    "this is seen for the self - isf in fig .  4 for our langevin simulation . here",
    ", we have chosen to present results for a small wave number @xmath70 , which is the wave number corresponding to a lattice constant so that the self - isf indicates dynamics at the length scale of nearest neighbors . as we varied @xmath22 in fig .  4",
    ", we held @xmath71 and @xmath72 as constants .",
    "we note two features of the self - isf curves in fig .  4 that are different on either side of this sudden change .",
    "first , the gap between curves is much wider for low temperature ( high @xmath22 ) conditions in the upper right of the figure as compared to the high temperature conditions in the lower left .",
    "we varied @xmath22 in small steps near @xmath73 , where we find the sudden change in the gaps between the self - isf curves .",
    "second , we identify different shapes for the decay of the self - isf for low and high temperatures .",
    "for the high temperature ( low @xmath22 ) conditions expected for liquids we found , in sec .",
    "iv  a , that the self - isf decays according to the empirical law eq .  ( [ s - exponential ] ) ,",
    "but for low temperatures we found that eq .",
    "( [ s - exponential ] ) does not come even close to the shape of the curves in the upper right of fig .",
    "comparing to previous simulations that used structural measures , we can confirm that the sudden change in the self - isf curve corresponds to the phase transition .",
    "using a measure of local orientation order that exhibited a large jump at the phase transition , a phase transition curve for @xmath22 vs. @xmath23 was reported , fig .  6 in @xcite .",
    "interpolating their results , we find that the phase transition occurs at about @xmath74 for @xmath71 , for a 2d yukawa system modeled with a frictionless md simulation . this result is consistent with the sudden change that we observed in our self - isf curves for @xmath75 in fig .  4 : first",
    ", the curve s shape is changed ; second , the curves are narrowly spaced for liquids ( @xmath76 ) and widely spaced for solids ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "( one difference in the simulations of @xcite and ours is our use of friction comparable to values in 2d dusty plasma experiments .",

    "thus , we conclude that the self - isf curve is very sensitive to phase .",
    "it shows promise to become a reliable indicator of the phase transition , although further tests , for different physical parameters would be needed to confirm its reliability .",
    "an attraction of this method is that the self - isf is a dynamical rather than structural measure .",
    "combining both dynamical and structural measures can be useful in distinguishing phases .",
    "for example , supercooled liquids have the structure of normal liquids , so that a dynamical measure is needed to distinguish the two .",

    ", we again find the same two results as for varying @xmath22 .",
    "there is a sudden change in the gaps between curves , and the curves take a different shape at a point that we can identify as the phase transition .",

    "we could use the fit parameter @xmath21 from eq .",
    "( [ s - exponential ] ) , but for simplicity , rather than fitting the self - isf , here we will adopt the practice of other authors of measuring the time required for the self - isf to decay by a factor of @xmath78 @xcite .",

    "the curves at higher damping rates have the same general shape , but are retarded in time .",
    "in other words , friction has a significant effect on the timing of relaxation , but not the melting point . for the limiting case of no friction",

    "<S> the self - intermediate scattering function ( self - isf ) , calculated from simulation data , exhibits a temporal decay , or relaxation , with a characteristic relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> this decay is found to be useful for distinguishing normal and anomalous diffusion in a liquid , and for identifying the solid - liquid phase transition . for liquids , a scaling of the relaxation time with length scale is found . for the solid - liquid phase transition , </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the self - isf curve is found to be a sensitive indicator of phase . </S>",
    "<S> friction has a significant effect on the timing of relaxation , but not the melting point . </S>"
