    "adequate models of human language for syntactic analysis and semantic interpretation are typically of context - free complexity or beyond .",
    "indeed , prolog - style definite clause grammars ( dcgs ) and formalisms such as patr with feature - structures and unification have the power of turing machines to recognise arbitrary recursively enumerable sets .",
    "since recognition and analysis using such models may be computationally expensive , for applications such as speech processing in which speed is important finite - state models are often preferred .",
    "when natural language processing and speech recognition are integrated into a single system one may have the situation of a finite - state language model being used to guide speech recognition while a unification - based formalism is used for subsequent processing of the same sentences .",
    "rather than write these two grammars separately , which is likely to lead to problems in maintaining consistency , it would be preferable to derive the finite - state grammar automatically from the ( unification - based ) analysis grammar .",
    "the finite - state grammar derived in this way can not in general recognise the same language as the more powerful grammar used for analysis , but , since it is being used as a front - end or filter , one would like it not to reject any string that is accepted by the analysis grammar , so we are primarily interested in ` sound approximations ' or ` approximations from above ' .",
    "attention is restricted here to approximations of context - free grammars because context - free languages are the smallest class of formal language that can realistically be applied to the analysis of natural language .",
    "techniques such as restriction @xcite can be used to construct context - free approximations of many unification - based formalisms , so techniques for constructing finite - state approximations of context - free grammars can then be applied to these formalisms too .",
    "a ` finite - state calculus ' or ` finite automata toolkit ' is a set of programs for manipulating finite - state automata and the regular languages and transducers that they describe .",
    "standard operations include intersection , union , difference , determinisation and minimisation .",
    "recently a number of automata toolkits have been made publicly available , such as fire lite @xcite , grail @xcite , and fsa utilities @xcite .",
    "finite - state calculus has been successfully applied both to morphology @xcite and to syntax ( constraint grammar , finite - state syntax ) .",
    "the work described here used a finite - state calculus implemented by the author in sicstus prolog .",
    "the use of prolog rather than c or c++ causes large overheads in the memory and time required .",
    "however , careful account has been taken of the way prolog operates , its indexing in particular , in order to ensure that the asymptotic complexity is as good as that of the best published algorithms , with the result that for large problems the prolog implementation outperforms some of the publicly available implementations in c++ .",
    "some versions of the calculus allow transitions to be labelled with arbitrary prolog terms , including variables , a feature that proved to be very convenient for prototyping although it does not essentially alter the power of the machinery .",
    "( it is assumed that the string being tested consists of ground terms so no unification is performed , just matching . )",
    "there are two main ideas behind this algorithm .",
    "the first is to describe the finite - state approximation using formulae with regular languages and finite - state operations and to evaluate the formulae directly using the finite - state calculus .",
    "the second is to use , in intermediate stages of the calculation , additional , auxiliary symbols which do not appear in the final result .",
    "a similar approach has been used for compiling a two - level formalism for morphology @xcite .    in this case the auxiliary symbols are dotted rules from the given context - free grammar .",
    "a dotted rule is a grammar rule with a dot inserted somewhere on the right - hand side , e.g.    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ s @xmath0 @xmath1 np vp + s @xmath0 np @xmath1 vp + s @xmath0 np vp @xmath1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    however , since these dotted rules are to be used as terminal symbols of a regular language , it is convenient to use a more compact notation : they can be replaced by a triple made out of the nonterminal symbol on the left - hand side , an integer to determine one of the productions for that nonterminal , and an integer to denote the position of the dot on the right - hand side by counting the number of symbols to the left of the dot .",
    "so , if ` s @xmath0 np vp ' is the fourth production for s , the dotted rules given above may be denoted by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "it will turn out to be convenient to use a slightly more complicated notation : when the dot is located after the last symbol on the right - hand side we use @xmath5 as the third element of the triple instead of the corresponding integer , so the last triple is @xmath6 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "( note that @xmath5 is an additional symbol , not a variable . ) moreover , for epsilon - rules , where there are no symbols on the right - hand side , we treat the @xmath7 as it were a real symbol and consider there to be two corresponding dotted rules , e.g.  @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponding to ` mod @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath7 ' and ` mod @xmath0 @xmath7 @xmath1 ' for the rule ` mod @xmath0 @xmath7 ' .    using these dotted rules as auxiliary symbols we can work with regular languages over the alphabet @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of terminal symbols",
    ", @xmath12 is the set of nonterminals , @xmath13 is the number of productions for nonterminal @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the number of symbols on the right - hand side of the @xmath16th production for @xmath14 .",
    "it will be convenient to use the symbol @xmath17 as a ` wildcard ' , so @xmath18 means @xmath19 and @xmath20 means @xmath21 .",
    "( this last example explains why we use @xmath5 rather than @xmath15 ; it would otherwise not be possible to use the ` wildcard ' notation to denote concisely the set @xmath22 . )",
    "we can now attempt to derive an expression for the set of strings over @xmath23 that represent a valid parse tree for the given grammar : the tree is traversed in a top - down left - to - right fashion and the daughters of a node x expanded with the @xmath16th production for x are separated by the symbols @xmath24 .",
    "( equivalently , one can imagine the auxiliary symbols inserted in the appropriate places in the right - hand side of each production so that the grammar is then unambiguous . )",
    "consider , for example , the following grammar :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ s @xmath0 a s b + s @xmath0 @xmath7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "then the following is one of the strings over @xmath23 that we would like to accept , corresponding to the string @xmath25 accepted by the grammar : @xmath26    our first approximation to the set of acceptable strings is @xmath27 , i.e.  strings that start with beginning to parse an s and end with having parsed an s. from this initial approximation we subtract ( that is , we intersect with the complement of ) a series of expressions representing restrictions on the set of acceptable strings : and @xmath28 , respectively , while juxtaposition denotes concatenation and the bar denotes complementation ( @xmath29 ) . ]",

    "when each of these sets has been subtracted from the initial approximation we can remove the auxiliary symbols ( by applying the regular operator that replaces them with @xmath7 ) to give the final finite - state approximation to the context - free grammar .",
    "it may be admitted that the notation used for the dotted rules was partly motivated by the possibility of immediately testing the algorithm using the finite - state calculus in prolog : the regular expressions listed above can be evaluated directly using the ` wildcard ' capabilities of the finite - state calculus .",
    "figure  [ codefig ] shows the sequence of calculations that corresponds to applying the algorithm to the following grammar :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ s @xmath0 a s b + s @xmath0 @xmath7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    with the following notational explanations it should be possible to understand the code and compare it with the description of the algorithm .    * the procedure ` r(re , x ) ` evaluates the regular expression ` re ` and puts the resulting ( minimised ) automaton into a register with the name ` x ` . * ` list_fsa(x ) ` prints out the transition table for the automaton in register ` x ` .",

    "the context - free language recognised by the original context - free grammar is @xmath69 .",
    "the result of applying the approximation algorithm is a 3-state automaton recognising the language @xmath70 .",
    "applying the restrictions expressed by formulae [ e1][e6 ] gives an automaton whose size is at most a small constant multiple of the size of the input grammar .",
    "this is because these restrictions apply locally : the state that the automaton is in after reading a dotted rule is a function of that dotted rule .",
    "when restrictions [ e7][e8 ] are applied the final automaton may have size exponential in the size of the input grammar .",
    "for example , exponential behaviour is exhibited by the following class of grammars :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ s @xmath0 a@xmath71 s",

    "however , there does not seem to be a simple correspondence between conditions [ e7][e8 ] and the ` unfolding ' used by pereira and wright or rood : even some simple grammars such as ` s @xmath0 a s a @xmath87 b s b @xmath87 @xmath7 ' are approximated differently by [ e1][e8 ] than by pereira and wright s and rood s methods .",
    "in the case of some simple examples ( such as the grammar ` s @xmath0 a s b @xmath87 @xmath7 ' used earlier ) the approximation algorithm presented in this paper gives the same result as pereira and wright s algorithm .",
    "however , in many other cases ( such as the grammar ` s @xmath0 a s a @xmath87 b s b @xmath87 @xmath7 ' or the 18-rule grammar in the previous section ) the results are essentially different and neither of the approximations is better than the other .",
    "the new algorithm does not share the problem of pereira and wright s algorithm that certain right - linear grammars give an intermediate automaton of exponential size , and it was possible to calculate a useful approximation fairly rapidly in the case of the 18-rule grammar in the previous section .",
    "however , it is not yet possible to draw general conclusions about the relative efficiency of the two procedures .",
    "nevertheless , the new algorithm seems to have the advantage of being open - ended and adaptable : in the previous section it was possible to complete a difficult calculation by relaxing the conditions of formulae  [ e7][e8 ] , and it is easy to see how those conditions might also be strengthened .",
    "for example , a more complicated version of formulae  [ e7][e8 ] might check two levels of recursive application of the same rule rather than just one level and it might be useful to generalise this to @xmath40 levels of recursion in a manner analagous to rood s generalisation of pereira and wright s algorithm .",
