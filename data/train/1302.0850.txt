    "the @xmath0 bat survey with over 500 agn has revolutionized our study of the ultra hard x - ray sky @xcite , but is still limited to bright ( @xmath13@xmath4@xmath14  erg s@xmath15 @xmath11 ) objects in a blind survey .",
    "however , the stability of the instrument and the gaussian nature of the noise , along with its wide energy range , allows the detection at fainter limits for a well defined , moderate sized sample of objects . for the first time",
    ", we use this property to study the agn in luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath3@xmath4@xmath16 ) .",
    "the nature of the ir ( 8 - 1000 @xmath17 m ) emission and its relation to star formation in agn is still not well understood .",
    "past studies of samples of lirgs have suggested , based primarily on optical and ir agn indicators , that the dominant power source is star formation and agn activity is more common in luminous sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies used a variety of mid - ir spectral diagnostics and x - ray observations @xcite to determine the agn contribution .",
    "however , contamination from star formation and obscuration by dust and gas are problematic .",
    "additionally , studies of agn in the hard x - rays have shown the existence of large fraction of agn not showing spitzer irac agn indicators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and some agn are not optically detected @xcite . since a significant fraction of x - ray selected agn",
    "are in lirgs @xcite , an ultra - hard x - ray survey of lirgs might come to different conclusions than those derived at lower energies .",
    "the ultra hard x - rays ( @xmath415 kev ) are much less sensitive to obscuration in the line - of - sight than soft x - ray or optical wavelengths and are biased only against highly compton - thick agn @xcite .",
    "this band is also free from contamination from star formation that is significant in the soft x - rays ( @xmath25 kev ) .",
    "additionally , in compton - thick agn the radiation below 10 kev is almost completely absorbed in the x - rays whereas a broad compton reflection hump appears in the @xmath415 kev continuum ( reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "thus , ultra - hard x - ray observations are an important complement to lower energy x - ray data .",
    "we use the the most sensitive all - sky ultra hard x - ray survey from the @xmath0 bat instrument to search for agn emission in lirgs .",
    "previous studies using the @xmath18 satellite stacked emission from a large sample of iras bright galaxies and found no agn detection @xcite .",
    "additionally , past bat agn catalogs generated @xmath4@xmath19 sources from `` blind '' detections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to achieve higher sensitivities",
    ", we identify agn ( see @xmath202.2 ) based on the prior knowledge of source positions and search in energy bands where we expect the agn emission to be brightest .",
    "we adopt a standard cosmology ( @xmath21=0.3 , @xmath22=0.7 , @xmath23 = 70 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ) to determine distances .",
    "we selected a sample of nearby lirgs ( z@xmath2@xmath24 ) in the northern hemisphere ( dec@xmath4 - 25 ) from the great observatories all sky lirg survey ( goals ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this redshift range , we are sensitive to x - ray luminosities of @xmath25@xmath410@xmath26 erg / s .",
    "this limit effectively detects agn since it is ten times larger than the maximum known emission from a starburst galaxy ( e.g. , m82 , @xmath27@xmath2840.8 erg / s ) . since single temperatures and sed templates can overestimate ir luminosities @xcite , we recomputed goals ir luminosities based on sed fitting using iras data and a model joining a modified , single dust temperature greybody , that approximates hot - dust emission from agn heating .",
    "we have limited our sources to be outside the galactic plane ( b@xmath410@xmath29 ) because of source confusion in iras and swift , as well difficulty measuring stellar masses because of high levels of optical extinction .",
    "we have also limited our sample because in the low resolution bat detector , source confusion from nearby bright agn can occur .",
    "for blind source detection , @xcite estimated a confusion radius of 5.5@xmath30 at snr=2 , 3.8@xmath30 at snr=3 , and 2.8@xmath30 at snr=4 .",
    "we use a conservative approach and exclude all detections within 15@xmath30 of bat catalog sources .",
    "this excludes seven lirgs from our study .",
    "ngc 232 and ngc 838 are in merging galaxy groups with a nearby ( @xmath2@xmath31 ) bright bat - detected agn companion .",
    "additionally , ugc 3608 is 5.1@xmath30 from a nearby rosat x - ray source , 1rxs j065711.8 + 462731 .",
    "a 1.5 ks xrt observation suggests the majority of the flux is coincident with this rosat source .",
    "iras f03217 + 4022 and ugc 02717 are near a bright bat agn , iras 03219 + 4031 at 8.5@xmath30 and 7@xmath30 separation respectively .",
    "finally , ngc 2524 is near a bright bat agn mrk 0622 at 10.7@xmath30 .",
    "this leaves our total lirg sample with 134 objects .      in @xmath0 bat ,",
    "the detector noise distribution is a gaussian function centered at zero significance .",
    "real astrophysical sources show a tail in the distribution at positive significances .",
    "significant detections in the blind bat detection catalogs are defined at @xmath44.8 snr to ensure zero false sources caused by random fluctuations in a large sample ( @xmath32500 ) .",
    "source detection is performed on a map weighted to the crab nebula , using a single average map of all eight energy bins between 14 - 195 kev .",
    "however , many real astrophysical sources are below 4.8 snr and can be studied based on known positions of galaxies and by studying energy range where the source population is brightest .",
    "using the 24 - 35 kev energy bin for instance , we are more sensitive to the reflection component of obscured agn .",
    "we use the @xmath33 software which performs a sliding cell method to locate regions of the image which are significantly different from the background .",
    "we simultaneously fit all of the 1092 previously detected bat agn in the 70 month catalog along with the lirgs in the 14 - 195 kev band and 24 - 35 kev band .",
    "additionally , we select a comparison sample of 1000 galaxies matched in stellar mass and redshift from the nasa - sloan atlas @xcite . to compute the stellar mass of the lirgs and galaxy control sample , we use _ ugriz _ photometry following @xcite using the software @xmath34 v4.2 and sdss imaging . for galaxies in close mergers ,",
    "we follow @xcite and estimate the stellar mass from the largest galaxy .",
    "we use the distribution of snr for 1000 random pointings from the sdss survey area to measure the significance of the x - ray detections in the other samples .",
    "the significance distribution at 14 - 195 kev of the random pointings is well fit by a gaussian centered at 0.02@xmath120.11 snr with @xmath35=1.01@xmath120.06 , consistent with the expected values for a gaussian distribution of pure noise . for the lirg and matched sample ,",
    "the gaussian distribution of noise is fit from the snr@xmath20 source distribution .    we choose a 2.7@xmath35 cutoff snr in the 134 lirg sample to have on average less than one fake noise source based on the gaussian distribution of noise using both whole band 14 - 195 kev and 24 - 35 kev detections",
    "if we assume the distribution is pure noise .",
    "finally , we note that the lowest snr of any lirg is -2.1 at 14 - 195 kev and -2.7 at 24 - 35 kev suggesting this cutoff should assure a sample of clean individual detections .",
    "we also analyze x - ray emission using xspec v12.7.1 for the new sources between 2.7 - 4.8@xmath35 . to calculate luminosities and upper limits , we assume an x - ray power law of @xmath36@xmath281.9 and galactic extinction , consistent with the mean 14 - 195 kev power law for seyfert 2s in the 70 month blind detection catalog @xcite .",
    "the bat emission is absorbed by @xmath210% for @xmath37@xmath2@xmath38 @xmath11 , but sources with larger obscurations are underestimated . to determine 1@xmath35 errors in luminosity , we include the error from assuming a fixed power law index ( @xmath39 ) as well as sky and detector noise ( @xmath237% ) . finally , to better understand the average properties of the sources , we fit a simple x - ray power law to the average emission in each x - ray band .",
    "the ultra hard x - ray hardness flux ratio ( @xmath40=14 - 195 kev/2 - 10 kev ) provides a measure of obscuration in heavily obscured agn ( @xmath37@xmath4@xmath41 @xmath11 ) since the transmitted hard x - ray emission is suppressed by a much larger factor than the ultra hard x - ray emission .",
    "long term agn variability can affect this ratios , but this variability is typically 20 - 40% in the 2 - 10 kev x - rays @xcite and smaller in the ultra hard x - rays @xcite . to estimate",
    "absorbing columns corresponding to @xmath40 , we use the mytorus model @xcite , which fully treats photoelectric absorption and relativistic compton scattering .",
    "the intrinsic agn emission was modeled as a power law ( @xmath36=1.9 ) and the column density assumes the torus is seen edge - on following @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the emission is reduced by four at @xmath37@xmath28@xmath38 @xmath11 and @xmath37@xmath28@xmath42 @xmath11 for 2 - 10 kev and 14 - 195 kev , respectively , showing that the ultra hard x - rays can pass through an order of magnitude higher absorbing column . finally , as a comparison sample we measured the @xmath40 from 49 non - lirg bat - detected agn ( @xmath3@xmath2@xmath16 ) from @xcite from the same redshift range to understand whether bat agn in lirgs have higher levels of obscuration .",
    "we compare the bat detection significance at 14 - 195 kev and 24 - 35 kev of the lirgs and a sample of galaxies matched in stellar mass and redshift ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "there is an excess of lirgs at snr@xmath43 for 14 - 195 kev and snr@xmath42 at 24 - 35 kev , based on the distributions from random pointings .",
    "there is an excess of lirg detections over the matched galaxies at snr@xmath44 at 14 - 195 kev and at snr@xmath42 at 24 - 35 kev .",
    "the fraction in the lirg sample above 2.7@xmath35 at 14 - 195 kev is 11%@xmath122 ( 16/134 ) and at 24 - 35 kev 14%@xmath122 ( 19/134 ) , while the matched galaxy sample is only 2@xmath121% ( 21/1000 ) at 14 - 195 kev and 1@xmath121% ( 5/1000 ) at 24 - 35 kev .",
    "this suggests that lirgs are more likely to be detected as ultra hard x - ray agn than galaxies of a similar stellar mass and redshift consistent with previous results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although we can not reliably identify individual sources below 2.7 snr , analysis of gaussian fits to the negative snr distribution representative of noise , show a total lirg sample detection fraction of 33@xmath43% at 14 - 195 kev and 36@xmath44% at 24 - 35 kev compared to the matched galaxy sample detection fraction of only 9@xmath45% at 14 - 195 kev and 4@xmath46% at 24 - 35 kev .",
