    "the @xmath0-modes ( fluid oscillations whose dynamics is dominated by rotation ) of neutron stars have received considerable attention in the past few years because they appear to be subject to the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz gravitational radiation instability in realistic astrophysical conditions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "if the @xmath0-modes are unstable , i.e.  if the damping timescales due to viscous processes in neutron - star matter are longer than the gravitational - radiation driving timescale , a rapidly rotating neutron star could emit a significant fraction of its rotational energy and angular momentum as gravitational waves . with appropriate data analysis strategies",
    ", these waves could be detectable by interferometers comparable to enhanced ligo .",
    "the @xmath0-mode instability might also explain the relatively long spin periods observed in young pulsars and of older , accreting pulsars in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "recently jones  @xcite has pointed out that long - neglected processes involving hyperons ( massive cousins of the nucleons ) can lead to an extremely high coefficient of bulk viscosity in the core of a neutron star . using simple scaling arguments",
    "he suggests that the viscous damping timescales associated with these processes may be short enough to suppress the @xmath0-mode instability altogether in realistic astrophysical circumstances .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate this possibility more thoroughly .",
    "the hyperons only exist in the central core of a neutron star where the density is sufficiently high .",
    "the relevant effects of the @xmath0-modes however vanish as @xmath4 ( where @xmath0 is the distance from the center of the star ) . thus the overall effect of hyperon induced dissipation on the @xmath0-modes depends very sensitively on the size and structure of the core of a neutron star .",
    "jones initial estimates did not take properly into account either the structure of the @xmath0-mode or the detailed properties of the nuclear matter in the core of a neutron star .",
    "we improve on jones analysis in several ways : first we evaluate fully relativistic cross sections to determine the reaction rates of the relevant hyperon interactions .",
    "we find that these cross sections reduce to the results of jones  @xcite in the low - momentum limit , but can be about an order of magnitude larger in some regimes of neutron - star matter .",
    "second we derive new expressions for the bulk viscosity coefficient that are appropriate even for a relativistic fluid such as neutron star matter .",
    "third we construct detailed neutron star models based on an equation of state that includes hyperons and the appropriate interactions among all of the particle species present .",
    "due to superfluid effects the temperature and density dependence of hyperon bulk viscosity turns out to be quite complicated : superfluidity increases the viscosity in some cases while reducing it in others .",
    "and fourth , we use a more accurate model of the structure of the @xmath0-mode eigenfunction in the cores of these stars to evaluate the effects of hyperon dissipation .",
    "our analysis shows that hyperon bulk viscosity completely suppresses the gravitational radiation instability in the @xmath0-modes of rotating neutron stars for temperatures below a few times @xmath1  k. we find that the gravitational radiation instability acts most strongly at temperatures around @xmath3  k where stars rotating more than @xmath2 of the maximum rotation rate ( depending on the details of the microphysics ) are driven unstable .",
    "our coefficient of bulk viscosity is actually several hundred times that of jones  @xcite , who suggested that the instability was completely suppressed .",
    "however , our use of the proper @xmath0-mode eigenfunction reduces the dissipation by several orders of magnitude and we find that there is a window of instability .",
    "how long it lasts is another matter .",
    "if the core of the neutron star cools via the standard modified urca process , its temperature remains above a few times @xmath1  k for about a day  @xcite .",
    "this is enough time for an unstable @xmath0-mode to grow and radiate away a substantial fraction of the star s rotational kinetic energy and angular momentum into gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "however if the core of the star cools too quickly the instability might not have enough time to grow before being suppressed by the hyperon bulk viscosity .",
    "the time needed for a neutron - star core to cool to a few times @xmath1  k is reduced to about a second when direct urca processes are able to act  @xcite .",
    "modern equations of state have large enough proton densities in the core that direct urca cooling is now expected to act until the neutrons and protons condense into a superfluid state , i.e. above about @xmath1  k. the growth time for the gravitational radiation instability in the most rapidly rotating neutron stars is about 40  s  @xcite . thus we conclude that the core of a neutron star will probably cool too quickly for the @xmath0-mode instability to grow significantly before being suppressed by the hyperon bulk viscosity .    the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "once a neutron star cools below the transition temperature for the formation of neutron and proton superfluids , the relaxation timescale for the hyperon interactions will increase exponentially compared to the expressions derived here in eqs .",
    "( [ taus ] ) and ( [ tausl ] ) .",
    "this sharply reduces via eq .",
    "( [ realzeta ] ) the bulk viscosity from this process at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "further detailed calculations would be needed to determine whether the hyperon bulk viscosity has a significant influence on the @xmath0-mode instability at temperatures of a few times @xmath249k , which are expected to exist in the cores of neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "we did not carry out these calculations in part because solid crust - related shear  @xcite and magnetic field  @xcite effects are quite effective in suppressing the instability at these low temperatures .",
    "how robust is the conclusion that the @xmath0-mode instability is effectively suppressed ?",
    "clearly the details of the nuclear physics involving hyperons in neutron star matter are not well understood at this time .",
    "however , our conclusion applies to the entire expected range of the most poorly known properties of this material : the superfluid @xmath15 gap function and the axial vector coupling coefficients . in order to escape this conclusion",
    ", it would be necessary for neutron star matter to have very few hyperons present at the densities which exist in the cores of real neutron stars .",
    "this would require the equation of state to be substantially different from the one studied here , or the masses of neutron stars to be significantly smaller than @xmath250 .",
    "rapid rotation also lowers the central density and consequently the size of the hyperon core in a neutron star . the central density of a maximally rotating @xmath250 neutron star is about 73% of its non - rotating value ( for the equation of state studied here )  @xcite .",
    "this reduction almost eliminates the hyperon core for this extreme angular velocity , but over almost all of the range of angular velocities , 1.4@xmath243 stars have substantial hyperon cores .",
    "finally if the dissipation in the core were sufficiently large it might be possible for the @xmath0-mode eigenfunction to be clamped to zero in the core by the dissipative processes while remaining finite and unstable in the outer parts of the star .",
    "the discussion of this possibility in the appendix shows that the hyperon bulk viscosity is not strong enough to clamp the @xmath0-mode in this way .",
    "we thank p. b. jones for raising the issue of hyperon bulk viscosity , for communicating his unpublished work to us , and for giving us helpful comments on our work .",
    "we also thank s. balberg , d. chernoff , j. friedman , n. glendinning , p. goldreich , j. lattimer , g. mendell , j. miller , e. s. phinney , m. prakash , r. sawyer , and k. thorne for helpful discussions .",

    "bulk viscosity damps a mode by dissipating energy according to the expression @xmath251 for the case of the @xmath0-modes in slowly rotating stars , we may express the energy , and its time derivative as simple radial integrals : @xmath252 @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 are the angle averaged energy and energy dissipation rate densities respectively as given in eqs .",
    "( [ tildee_rint ] ) and ( [ dedt_rint ] ) .    the mode will be completely suppressed ( clamped ) locally if the amount of energy removed from the mode locally in one oscillation period is comparable to the local energy density of the mode .",
    "thus we define the local quality factor of the mode : @xmath256 if @xmath257 the mode will be clamped . for the @xmath0-modes",

    "thus @xmath263 for this case .",
    "figures  [ f : zeta ] and [ f : zeta10 ] show that the bulk viscosity never exceeds about @xmath264 in the temperature range of interest to us .",
    "thus , we conclude that the hyperon bulk viscosity represents a small perturbation on the basic hydrodynamic forces of the @xmath0-modes .",
    "the condition @xmath265 is violated only for relatively slowly rotating stars . in the domain where the gravitational radiation instability is most likely to be important",

    "<S> neutron stars are expected to contain a significant number of hyperons in addition to protons and neutrons in the highest density portions of their cores . following the work of jones , we calculate the coefficient of bulk viscosity due to nonleptonic weak interactions involving hyperons in neutron - star cores , including new relativistic and superfluid effects . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the influence of this new bulk viscosity on the gravitational radiation driven instability in the @xmath0-modes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the instability is completely suppressed in stars with cores cooler than a few times @xmath1  k , but that stars rotating more rapidly than @xmath2 of maximum are unstable for temperatures around @xmath3  k. since neutron - star cores are expected to cool to a few times @xmath1  k within seconds ( much shorter than the @xmath0-mode instability growth time ) due to direct urca processes , we conclude that the gravitational radiation instability will be suppressed in young neutron stars before it can significantly change the angular momentum of the star . </S>"
