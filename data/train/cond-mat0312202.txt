    "the landau - zener ( lz ) theory @xcite ( see also @xcite ) plays an important role in many different physical problems ranging from chemistry , biology , theory of collisions to the tunneling of bose - condensates , dynamics of glasses and spin reversal in magnetic wires and nanomagnets , as well as quantum computing .",
    "lz theory treats a rather simple and general situation of two - level crossing . near the point of ( avoided ) level",
    "crossing , adiabaticity is violated and transitions occur . the lz hamiltonian can be represented by a @xmath0 matrix acting in a two - dimensional space of vectors spanned by the basis vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and the transition matrix element @xmath5 does not depend on time . without loss of generality",
    "one can assume @xmath5 to be a positive constant .",
    "landau and zener have found the evolution matrix @xmath6 which connects initial amplitudes in the diabatic basis @xcite with their final values .",
    "the entries @xmath7 depend only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 which we call the lz parameter .    in many applications",
    "the lz theory must be modified to take into account thermal noise or noise of a different nature . in a pioneering work kayanuma @xcite",
    "has solved such a problem on the basis of three simplifying assumptions : i ) the regular transition matrix element is equal to zero ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , the noise is completely responsible for transitions ; ii ) the correlation function of noise has a simple exponential form ; iii ) the noise is fast .",
    "the first two limitations were lifted in the work by pokrovsky and sinitsyn @xcite .",
    "their analysis of time scales for different processes distinguishes the correlation time of noise @xmath10 , the accumulation time @xmath11 during which the noise effectively produces transitions , and the lz time @xmath12 during which the standard lz transition ( without noise ) proceeds .",
    "the noise is called fast if @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the separation of times allows to neglect the regular matrix element @xmath5 at @xmath14 and to neglect the noise in the interval @xmath15 .",
    "since these intervals overlap , one can solve first the reduced problem with the noise producing transitions and then match this solution with the lz solution . in this way the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have found the average value of the density matrix .",
    "the two - level problem is as usual equivalent to the problem of spin @xmath16 rotating in the time - dependent field containing regular and stochastic parts . in their second work @xcite",
    "the same authors represented the density matrix in terms of the bloch vector @xmath17 , @xmath18 \\ , \\label{rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the triplet of pauli matrices for spin @xmath20 .",
    "it is a well known fact that the square of the bloch vector is an integral of motion . in ref .",
    "@xcite this fact was used to calculate the square fluctuation @xmath21^{2}\\rangle = \\mathbf{g}^{2}-\\langle \\mathbf{g } ( t)\\rangle ^{2}.\\ ] ] however , the fluctuations of separate components , @xmath22^{2}\\rangle $ ] , ( @xmath23 ) were not calculated , neither two - time correlators @xmath24 were found .",
    "such fluctuations are observable , for example , in a system of magnetic molecules subject to the same magnetic field ( with identical regular and random contributions ) .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath25 component of the magnetic moment averaged over the system yields @xmath26 which depends on the particular noise history of the measurement .",
    "the repetition of such a measurement for many independent noise histories then yields an average @xmath27 with fluctuations @xmath28 ^ 2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar^2}4 \\langle [ \\delta g_z(t ) ] \\rangle$ ] .",
    "similarly , the twofold time dependence of the correlators @xmath29 determines spectral properties of the magnetization .",
    "namely this situation is realized in magnetic systems subject to an external regular and random magnetic field . in both cases",
    "we assume that the characteristic wave length of the electromagnetic field is much larger than the linear size of the system .    in two - level systems",
    "the random field can be realized by an environment , for example , by thermal phonons or by magnetic field of nuclei .",
    "in such a situation different two - level systems feel different random fields .",
    "therefore , in the ensemble consisting of a large number @xmath30 of the two - level systems the fluctuation will be suppressed proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "however , the two - time correlation function describes the linear response of such a system to a small perturbation @xmath32 ( identical for all members ) according to a standard linear - response equation : @xmath33 such a perturbation can be realized as a pulse of electric magnetic or acoustic field . in this work",
    "we determine all these correlations under the same assumption of fast noise .",

    "however , it is not crucial and is introduced only for simplification . if the longitudinal noise is independent of the transverse one , its contribution to the averaged exponent in equation ( [ eta.corr ] )",

    "thus , longitudinal dephasing can be neglected during the accumulation period @xmath81 of transverse noise for @xmath82 . on the other hand , on sufficiently large time",
