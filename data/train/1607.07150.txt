    "quantum cryptography has emerged as area of research in recent times .",
    "it is recognized that quantum processors can supersede current classical cryptographic protocols and offer highly secure cryptographic protocols for quantum communication . in @xmath0 ,",
    "bennett and brassard@xcite proposed the pioneering work in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , popularly known as bb84 protocol .",
    "this work motivated the scientific community to exploit the intriguing features of of quantum mechanics to get more secure and efficient cryptographic protocols .",
    "in qkd , initially a secret quantum key is established between communicating parties and then this key is used for encryption and decryption of the message which is sent classically by alice(sender ) to bob(receiver ) . with further developments in quantum cryptography ,",
    "two other kinds of protocols were proposed .",
    "these are the quantum secure direct communication(qsdc)@xcite scheme and the deterministic secure quantum communication(dsqc)@xcite scheme . unlike qkd ,",
    "the qsdc and dsqc techniques do not require previously shared key for communication : the secret messages are communicated directly .",
    "however , there is a slight difference between qsdc and dsqc .",
    "the later requires at least one bit of classical information to decode each qubit of the secret message and in the case of qsdc there is no requirement of any additional classical bit to decode the secret message@xcite .",
    "different qsdc and dsqc schemes have been proposed employing different entangled states such as epr pairs@xcite , ghz states@xcite , ghz - like states@xcite , w states@xcite etc . moreover , there are schemes employing different methods such as dense coding@xcite , entanglement swapping@xcite , teleportation@xcite etc for transmitting the secret message .",
    "recently , another kind of quantum communication scheme with the inclusion of a controller who controls the whole communication has been put forward by many research groups@xcite . in this scheme , designated as controlled quantum secure direct communication(cqsdc ) , the co - operation of the controller is essential for the successful communication between the legitimate users . in practical situations",
    "all users prefer a smaller system than the service provider .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to have a controller to prepare the state when it is needed for communication and have a control over the communication without the capability of accessing the secret message . in a recent work ,",
    "pathak@xcite pointed out that , since in the proposed methods an additional classical bit from the controller is required to decode the secret message , it is more appropriate to name this as cdsqc ( controlled secure direct quantum communication ) instead of cqsdc .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new controlled quantum communication protocol making use of ghz - like states@xcite and dense coding@xcite .",
    "this is achieved by exploiting a unique ghz - like state : the entanglement between two particles remain even after a measurement is made on one of the particles@xcite . since ,",
    "in the proposed scheme the communication between the legitimate users start only after receiving a classical bit from the controller , we designate our protocol as controlled quantum secure communication(cqsc ) , eventhough the communication as such is purely qsdc . the generalization of our protocol to n number of controllers is presented , where the controllers perform entanglement swapping also .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the cqsc using a ghz - like state and dense coding . in section 3",
    "we extend our scheme to cqsc with two controllers and in section 4 with three controllers . in section 5",
    "the method is generalized to the case of n number of controllers ( mcqsc ) .",
    "analysis of the security and efficiency of the proposed cqsc protocol is given in section 6 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 7 .",

    "similarly results corresponding to charlie s measurement in x basis are related as given in equation [ bell ] .",

    "bob share bell pairs according to equation [ bell2 ] as is pictorially shown in figure [ 1qsc ] .",
    "however , charlie shares his measurement result only with bob through a classical channel .",
    "this allows the receiver to have an advantage over eavesdropper .",

    "<S> we present a novel scheme for controlled quantum secure communication ( cqsc ) using ghz - like state . in this scheme , a trusted controller assists the users for achieving secure transmission of data between them . the dense coding technique is exploited to increase the qubit efficiency and we show that the proposed scheme is immune against common eavesdropping attacks . </S>",
