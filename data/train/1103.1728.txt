    "since einstein s epochal studies @xcite on general relativity ( gr ) , it has been argued that gravity is different at a deep level than other fundamental forces . according to the gr , one should think of gravity as a deformation of spacetime due to the presence of energy or stress .",
    "although , in the appropriate limit , gr reduces to newtonian gravity , till the present day there is no confirmed evidence for the gravitational fields , and their source  graviton . because of this , whenever the agenda is about gravity , new theories continue to attract much attention in physics . recently , verlinde @xcite has invented a conceptual theory that gravity is emergent , rather than the fundamental force .",
    "essentially , verlinde showed that one can start from very general considerations , and gravity emerges as an entropic force .",
    "in addition to this , verlinde s arguments reveal a fact that the key to understanding gravity is information ( or entropy ) .",
    "it is obvious that verlinde was highly inspired by early works on information storage in black holes by bekenstein @xcite , hawking @xcite and t hooft @xcite . in the framework of quantum gravity ,",
    "such an information storage is explained best by the holographic principle @xcite , which was originally proposed by t hooft @xcite .",
    "in fact , the holographic principle states that the entropy of a black hole ( bh ) is proportional to the surface area of its event horizon and not its volume ; that volume itself is illusory and the universe is really a hologram which is isomorphic to the information inscribed on the surface of its boundary .",
    "namely , the amount of information needed to describe a bh can be entirely coded on its event horizon .",
    "verlinde , considering both holographic principle and the second law of thermodynamics @xcite , showed that an entropic force is an apparent force that results from changes in the information associated with the positions of particles such that it drags particles towards and across the event horizon .",
    "videlicet , entropic forces are at work to pull particles across the holographic screen .",
    "macroscopically , this effect is nothing but the gravity .",
    "meanwhile , it should be noted that , prior to the verlinde s work , padmanabhan @xcite also obtained the newton s law of gravity by using the equipartition law of energy ; @xmath0 .",
    "however , in addition to the newton s second law and newtonian gravity , the astounding contribution coming from verlinde is the derivation of the einstein s equations . soon after verlinde s new proposal about the gravity , many relevant works appeared .",
    "some related ( and very recently published ) works can be seen in @xcite , and references therein .    in this paper",
    ", we think that it is interesting to consider the derivation of verlinde s entropic force in a spacetime with unusual asymptotics . to this end",
    ", we would like to contribute to the literature , and try to learn more about the concept of entropic force . because , we believe that only when more and more results on entropic force are available , verlinde s arguments will be more reliable .",
    "the paradigm of spacetimes with unusual asymptotics is best described by the metric of charged dilaton black holes ( cdbhs ) cdbh . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned with cdbhs , which are stationary and static .",
    "cdbhs have both asymptotically flat ( af ) and non - asymptotically flat ( naf ) features depending on their dilaton parameter",
    " `` @xmath1 '' .",
    "the beauty of cdbhs is that they have schwarzschild limit when the dilaton field vanishes . here",
    ", we introduce three different candidates in order to define the holographic screen ( hs ) , locating at equipotential surfaces , of a cdbh : accelerating surface ( as ) , static hs and stretched horizon ( sh ) , which might also be described as a rindler spacetime . after giving the brief summary of formulation of the entropic force",
    ", we calculate the each temperature of these holographic screens , and plug the temperatures separately into the derived entropic force formula . in doing this",
    ", we also verify that the obtained entropic forces reduce to the results found in a very recent study @xcite , by myung and kim , in which the schwarzschild spacetime is considered , and thus to the newton s force law .",
    "of course , the ultimate aim here is to highlight the effect of the dilaton parameter on the entropic force by making use of numerical computation and plotting .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows .",
    "a brief summary of the idea underlying verlinde s entropic force is given in the next section .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv are devoted to the derivation of the entropic force by using as and static hs methods , respectively .",
    "v , we calculate the entropic force on the sh .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion , which appears in sec .",
    "vi .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the natural units of @xmath2 are used .",
    "here we briefly mention some key points of the entropic force by following @xcite . as a demonstration to the usage of verlinde s entropic force",
    ", we retrieve the newton s law of gravitation by using the holographic screen in the non - relativistic case .",
    "verlinde postulated that the change of entropy on a holographic screen in which a test particle of mass @xmath3 is located very close to it is linear with distance @xmath4 , namely    @xmath5    according to the first law of thermodynamics , the entropic force exerting on the test particle due to the change in entropy is    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the temperature . after manipulating eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it is easy to see that    @xmath8    from here on , above identity will be our master equation to obtain the entropic force",
    ". simply put , once the temperature on the holographic screen is defined , we just insert it into eq .",
    "( 3 ) and get the entropic force .",
    "remarkably , let us recall the equipartition rule of energy :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the partition number .",
    "as proposed by verlinde , if we combine the holographic principle and the equipartition rule of energy , @xmath11 is interpreted as the number of bits on the holographic screen .",
    "in fact , this number is proportional to the area of the holographic screen as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is an constant , which is equal to one for af and spherically symmetric spacetimes . as it can be seen in the latter section",
    ", @xmath13 can take values different than one depending on the non - asymptotic flatness of the spacetime .    in order to reach the newtonian force law ,",
    "it is plausible to assume the holographic screen as a spherical screen with radius @xmath14 which belongs to an af spacetime , whose its total mass @xmath15 is located at its centre . thus , the equipartition of energy rule takes the following form    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the entropy of the holographic screen with the area @xmath18 it is needless to say that @xmath19 is identified with the mass @xmath20 inside the screen . by using eq .",
    "( 6 ) , one can easily read the temperature on the holographic screen as    @xmath21    as we emphasized before , once the temperature of the holographic screen is determined , the entropic force is easily read from eq .",
    "thus , after plugging eq .",
    "( 7 ) into eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we obtain the entropic force as    @xmath22    which is the well - known newton s law of gravitation .",
    "in the low - energy limit of string field theory , the four - dimensional action ( in einstein frame ) describing the dilaton field @xmath23 with its parameter @xmath24 ( without loss of generality , we consider @xmath25 )  coupled to a @xmath26 gauge field @xcite is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the curvature scalar and @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is the maxwell field associated with a @xmath26 subgroup of @xmath31 or spin(32)/@xmath32 . in the presence of a electric charge with the non - constant the dilaton field ,",
    "the static spherically symmetric solutions are designated with cdbhs @xcite whose metric is given by    @xmath33    where the metric functions @xmath34 and @xmath14 are    @xmath35    and    @xmath36    here @xmath37 denotes the event horizon of the cdbhs , @xmath38  is an arbitrary real constant , and another real constant @xmath39 is governed by    @xmath40    the dilaton is found in the following form    @xmath41    where    @xmath42 \\text { and } \\phi _ { 1}=\\frac{n}{a},\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 refers to the electric charge . in this case , the solution for the electromagnetic field is found as    @xmath44    cdbhs are not vacuum solutions since the action ( 9 ) contains a static dilaton fluid whose energy - momentum tensor never vanishes .",
    "essentially , taking account of such a particular fluid model makes the cdbhs so special that they are neither af nor naf .    by following the quasilocal mass definition for the naf bhs , which was defined by brown and york @xcite",
    ", one can see that the horizon @xmath45 is related to the mass @xmath15 through    @xmath46    for @xmath47 , the horizon at @xmath48 hides the singularity located at @xmath49 . in the extreme case",
    "@xmath50  metric ( 10 ) still exhibits the features of the bhs . because the singularity at @xmath51 is null and marginally trapped such that it prevents the outgoing signals to reach the external observers . besides all these",
    ", a cdbh has no inner horizon and no extremal limit on the charge @xmath43 .",
    "this is one of the characteristics of the cdbhs .",
    "metric functions ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) correspond to the linear dilaton bhs ldbh in the case of @xmath52 . on the other hand , while @xmath53 with @xmath54 metric ( 10 ) reduces to the schwarzschild bh .",
    "finally , it is worth to note that the cdbhs have no zero charge limit .",
    "the aim of this section is to define the entropic force on the as of the cdbh . the definition of the as or so - called bulk is first introduced by mkel @xcite , and it has been recently used in @xcite in order to derive the entropic force appeared in the schwarzschild bh . here",
    ", we also consider the as as if a hs , and we shall derive the entropic force for the cdbhs .    if one defines a future pointing unit vector @xmath55 , which is the congruence for the timelike world lines of the points on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath56 , it should satisfy the following orthogonality condition    @xmath57    where @xmath58 $ ]  is a normal vector on @xmath56 .",
    "generic choice of the future pointing unit vector is @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "essentially , the reason of using the future pointing unit vector @xmath55 is to find the change of the heat , which is related with the acceleration .",
    "thus , it is plausible to introduce the local acceleration in terms of @xmath55  as follows :    @xmath60    where `` ; '' denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "this implies that the only nonzero component of the proper acceleration vector is    @xmath61 , \\ ] ]    in which a prime symbol denotes derivative with respect to @xmath62 .",
    "the proper acceleration is defined by    @xmath63    which yields    @xmath64 } { \\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{+}}{r}}},\\ ] ]    by the virtue of the above result , one can read the unruh temperature unruh as    @xmath65 } { \\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{+}}{r}}},\\ ] ]    the meaning of this result is that an accelerating observer , who sits on the as with @xmath62 distance far away from the center of the cdbh always detects thermal radiation with @xmath66 in other words , from the viewpoint of the accelerating observer , the space of the inertial observer in which it is filled with the quantized fields that make up a universe around cdbh looks like a state containing many particles in thermal equilibrium with @xmath67 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the unruh effect emerges from the local quantum fields @xcite . in the schwarzschild limit ( @xmath68 with @xmath69 )",
    ", the unruh temperature ( 22 ) reduces to    @xmath70    which has the newtonian limit at large distances @xmath71",
    "@xmath72    since our aim is to attain the entropic force on the as of the cdbh , the flux @xmath73  of the proper acceleration through the as should be taken into account . to this end",
    ", we use the definition of @xmath73 given by @xcite    @xmath74    from which it readily follows that    @xmath75 } { \\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{+}}{r}}},\\ ] ]    introducing the change of heat @xmath76 as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 denotes the differential of the flux @xmath73through the as .",
    "let us suppose that the proper acceleration @xmath79 is uniform on the as when varying the flux @xmath80 this corresponds to @xmath81 such that the following relation automatically appears :    @xmath82 -a^{6}r^{2}\\}}{r(1+a^{2})^{2}\\left [ ( a^{4}-1)m - a^{4}r\\right ] } dr,\\ ] ]    inserting this into eq .",

    "this result shows us that any object possessing mass @xmath3 will be under the influence of infinitely tidal force while it is close to the horizon , @xmath88 at large distance limit , @xmath89 , @xmath90 takes the following form    @xmath91    one can easily see that the above equation takes the newtonian force law ( 8) if @xmath92 and @xmath93  is chosen .",
    "that is why , we prefer to symbolize the large distance limit of @xmath94 as @xmath95 , and designate it as modified newtonian force . as illustrated in fig.1 , the value of the dilaton parameter @xmath1 is effective on @xmath96which is exerted by the mass @xmath15 of the cdbh on the object possessing mass @xmath3 . here",
    ", we considered a small object compared to the mass of the bh .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath97 @xmath95 increases .",
    "this intriguing result might also be used to prove the existence of the dilaton fields in the future . on the other hand",
    ", it is observed that when @xmath1 gets higher values than zero , up to infinity , @xmath95 behaves like the conventional newtonian force . in the caption of fig .",
    "1 , the values of the physical parameters are depicted .",
    "in this section , we briefly review how one derives the entropic force on the static hs , which belongs to the cdbh ( 10 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we first consider the following definition for nonzero component of the proper acceleration vector @xcite    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is a timelike killing vector . in order to define the concept of energy in the stationary spacetime",
    ", one might use @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the bulk volume enclosed by spacelike hypersurface @xmath56 i.e. @xmath102 .",
    "in general , the nonzero component of the killing vector for the outer region of the cdbh ( @xmath103 ) is given by @xmath104.$ ] by using these quantities , we can easily evaluate the integral ( 36 ) and obtain the energy , which is defined on the hs of the cdbh as follows    @xmath105 } { \\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{+}}{r}}},\\ ] ]    one can easily verify that while @xmath68 with @xmath54 it reduces to    @xmath106    which is the energy of the hs for the schwarzschild bh .",
    "namely , our result ( 37 ) is consistent with the hs energy result reported in @xcite .",
    "when an observer is at rest and located at coordinate @xmath62 with respect to cdbh spacetime , @xmath107 corresponds to the energy of the gravitational field , which is measured by that observer . after imposing the local equipartition rule    @xmath108    where @xmath109 indicates the entropy on the hs located at @xmath110 where is outside of the horizon .",
    "@xmath109 is found by    @xmath111    thus , by using of eq .",
    "( 39 ) one can obtain the temperature on the hs of cdbh as    @xmath112 } { \\sqrt{1-\\frac{r_{+}}{r}}},\\ ] ]    considering eq.(32 ) , we see that @xmath113 . namely , the bulk temperature @xmath114 is exactly equal to the hs temperature @xmath115    finally , inserting eq.(41 ) into eq .",

    "thence , the entropic force ( 3 ) is read for those unusual asymptotical cdbhs .",
    "all deserved limits of that entropic force ( 42 ) can be easily verified .",
    "consequently , the procedure followed up to obtain the entropic force shows us that it is not only applicable to af bhs , but it could be used for naf bhs as well .",

    "( 37 ) is used for in defining the local energy of the holographic screen on the stretched horizon ",
    "@xmath130 significantly , one can easily verify that the equipartition of energy @xmath131 is satisfied .",
    "however , the number of bits stored on the holographic screen is found as @xmath132 when comparing this result with eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we see that the proportionality constant @xmath133 which changes between @xmath134 and @xmath135 i.e. ,  @xmath136 depending on the value of the dilaton parameter @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "the dilaton parameter @xmath1 scales the total information stored on the screen such that it reaches its maximum when @xmath137 , which corresponds to the vanishing of the dilaton field or to the af  spacetime . in terms of the bekenstein - hawking entropy    @xmath138",
    "one can easily see that @xmath139 . after imposing the first law of thermodynamics    @xmath140",
    "we see that the entropy on the sh should be    @xmath141    obviously , the factor @xmath142  always prevents the equality of both entropies .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of ultrahigh dilaton field , corresponding to the limit of @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 become almost same .",
    "conversely , while @xmath126 @xmath146 becomes double of @xmath147 as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "hence , one can remark that depending on the dilaton parameter @xmath1 , the rate @xmath148 changes in the manner that @xmath149 .    finally , according to our established entropic force derivation , it is now necessary to substitute eq .",
    "( 46 ) into eq .",
    "thus , the entropic force on the sh yields    @xmath150    where @xmath151  is the proper acceleration on the sh .",
    "alternatively , @xmath152 can alternatively be obtained by taking the near horizon limit ( @xmath120 ) of eq .",
    "after making the remarkable connections between gravity and thermodynamics , we showed that whenever the temperature on a holographic screen is read precisely , it is easy to calculate the entropic force by using @xmath153 .",
    "in addition to this , it is also shown that verlinde s entropic force formalism is applicable to the cdbhs , which are neither af nor naf spacetimes . as a result",
    ", we support the verlinde s arguments , which imply that gravity is not a fundamental force but emergent .    in this paper",
    ", we introduced three possible distinct surfaces ( or screens ) , which are separately being a candidate for the hs of a cdbh .",
    "those are the as , the static hs and the sh or the rindler spacetime of the cdbh . among them",
    ", the sh is the special one . because , the sh is located at such a specific place that when all the other obtained temperatures are recalculated for the location of the sh , they all , and thus their corresponding entropic forces , become equivalent . on the other hand , the entropic forces obtained by using of the as and of the hs reduce to the entropic force of the schwarzschild bh when the dilaton field is terminated , and subsequently to the newton s force law at large distances .",
    "dependence of the entropic force of a small object ( compared with the mass @xmath15 of the bh ) having mass @xmath3 on the dilaton parameter at large distances is graphically illustrated .",
    "the graph shows us that a distant observer may feel the gravity of the cdbh higher than the newton s force if the strength of the dilaton field increases .",
    "the latter result might provide a clue to experimentally test the concept of entropic force , or even to detect the dilaton fields .",
    "finally , we should say that the discussions on the verlinde s arguments have been continuing without pausing , even day by day one can see many new studies , which are referring the verlinde s work @xcite pro and con ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "although we sustain that our analysis is not adequate to fully understand the entropic force , here our ultimate aim is to make a contribution to the literature that the derivation of the entropic force according to the verlinde s arguments is also possible in the spacetimes with unusual asymptotics .",
    "moreover , we would like to keep the topic fresh . because we believe that even the verlinde s arguments turn out to be in the wrong ,",
