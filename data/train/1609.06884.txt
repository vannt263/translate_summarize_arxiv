    "a new concept has come up in recent years @xcite .",
    "the concept exploits mode matching of the focused radiation to an electric dipole mode ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite and citations therein ) .    focusing in free - space experiments",
    "is usually done with state - of - the - art lens based imaging systems @xcite .",
    "single lenses , however , suffer from inherent drawbacks like dispersion induced chromatic aberrations , optical aberrations , and auto - fluorescence , respectively . most of these limitations can be corrected to a high degree by precisely assembling several coated lenses in a lens - system , _",
    "e.g. _ in a high numerical aperture ( _ na _ ) objective .",
    "although solving some problems , multi - lens - systems induce new problems such as short working distances , low transmission for parts of the optical spectrum , the need for immersion fluids , and high costs , respectively . therefore , multi - lens systems are often application specific providing best performance only for the demands that are most important for the application .",
    "mirror based objectives are an alternative to lens - based systems and can overcome some of these problems .",
    "the improvement is based on a mirror s inherent property of being free from chromatic aberrations .",
    "the nearly wavelength independent behavior also leads to a homogeneous reflectivity for a large spectral window . comparing the reflectivity of mirrors to the transmission of lens based objectives ,",
    "mirrors can sometimes also surpass lens - based systems .",
    "but surprisingly , they are rarely used when high interaction efficiency is required .",
    "this lack in application may be due to the fact that reflecting imaging systems , like the cassegrain reflector , can not provide a high _ na_. a high _ na _ is however needed for matching the emission pattern of a dipole , which spans over the entire solid angle .",
    "the limitation in _",
    "na _ consequently constitutes a limitation in the maximum achievable light - matter coupling efficiency .",
    "high na parabolic mirrors ( _ na _ = 0.999 ) have meanwhile been successfully applied as objectives in confocal microscopy@xcite , demonstrating the potential for imaging applications . the parabolic mirror ( pm ) is a single optical element that , in theory , can cover nearly the complete 4@xmath0 solid angle for tight focusing @xcite . in this article",
    "we report on the realization of such a 4@xmath0 parabolic mirror ( 4@xmath0-pm ) and characterize its optical performance . the mirror s focusing capabilities",
    "are applied in a light - matter interface with a single @xmath1yb@xmath3 ion , trapped in a stylus like movable paul trap @xcite . in the interface , we move the ion trap to position the ion in the focus of the parabolic mirror and focus light onto it . thereby , a solid angle of @xmath4 that is relevant for a linear dipole transition is covered for focusing .",
    "this number especially exceeds an experiment we previously reported that was technically limited to @xmath5 of the solid angle @xcite . based on the large solid angle coverage , tight focusing from all spatial directions",
    "is expected .",
    "this is proven by measuring the effective excitation point spread function ( _ psf _ ) of our focusing system .",
    "we compare our findings with simulations incorporating a finite ion temperature and interferometrically measured wavefront aberrations of the parabolic mirror itself . in our discussion , the parabolic mirror is compared to other high _ na _ focusing tools , especially to lens - based 4@xmath0  microscopes .",
    "its possible field of application is discussed and further improvements to the existing set - up are proposed .",
    "our main experimental intention is to focus light to a minimal spot size in all spatial directions simultaneously .",
    "the highest electric energy density that can be realized with any focusing optics is created by an electric dipole wave @xcite .",
    "we therefore choose this type of spatial mode in our experiment .",
    "the electric dipole wave is created by first converting a linear polarized gaussian beam into a radially polarized donut mode via a segmented half - wave plate ( b- halle ) @xcite .",
    "second , the radially polarized donut mode is focused with a parabolic mirror onto the trapped ion .",
    "this , in theory , enables us to convert approximately @xmath6 of the donut mode into a linear dipole mode @xcite .",
    "the conversion efficiency is limited since the donut mode is only approximating the ideal spatial mode that is necessary to create a purely linear dipole mode @xcite by being focused with the parabolic mirror .",
    "the donut mode , however , yields the experimental advantage of being propagation invariant and comparably easy to generate .",
    "our focusing tool , the parabolic mirror , is made of diamond turned aluminum ( fraunhofer institute for applied optics and precision engineering , jena ) with a reflectivity of 64% for the incident mode at a wavelength of @xmath7 nm .",
    "its geometry has a focal length of 2.1 mm and an outer aperture of 20 mm in diameter . in total",
    ", the geometry covers 81% of the complete solid angle .",
    "this fraction corresponds to 94% of the solid angle that is relevant for coupling to a linear dipole oriented along the axis of symmetry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mirror has three bores near its vertex : two bores with a diameter of 0.5 mm for dispensing neutral atoms and for illuminating the ion with additional laser beams , respectively ; and one bore with a diameter of 1.5 mm for the ion trap itself .",
    "the ion trap is a stylus - like paul trap similar to @xcite with high optical access .",
    "the trap is mounted on a movable xyz piezo translation stage ( pihera p-622k058 , physik instrumente ) that is used for measuring the effective excitation _",

    "we measure the effective excitation _ psf _ by probing the focal spot at different positions . in order to do so",
    ", we use the translation stage to scan the ion through the focal spot with an increment of 25 nm . at each position",
    ", the incoming dipole mode excites the @xmath8 transition that has a wavelength of @xmath7 nm . the relevant energy levels of @xmath9 are shown in figure [ fig : setup ] .",
    "we weakly drive this transition such that the probability for exciting the ion into the @xmath10 state is proportional to the electric energy density at any point in the focal area . during these measurements ,",
    "the ion is doppler cooled by the focused donut mode .",
    "hence , the detuning of this mode relative to the @xmath8 transition and its power determine the temperature of the ion , see appendix for further details .",
    "since we excite the ion from nearly the complete solid angle , we can not directly detect the fluorescent response of the ion at the same wavelength .",

    "afterwards , we detect them with a photomultiplier tube in geiger mode operation ( mp-942 , perkin elmer ) that has a remaining underground / dark count rate of 10 - 20cps .",
    "the overall detection efficiency @xmath17 at the detection wavelength @xmath12 was measured via pulsed excitation and amounts to @xmath18 .",
    "the detection efficiency is needed for the determination of the coupling efficiency to the trapped ion .",

    "concentration of light into a narrow three dimensional volume is involved in many scientific applications .",

    "this kind of free - space set - up may be an alternative to cavity based light - matter interfaces also providing high interaction strength .",
    "but in contrast to cavity assisted set - ups , free - space experiments often have a low level of instrument complexity and provide higher bandwidth .",
    "this is important considering the scalability and flexibility of an experimental set - up .",
    "technically , concentration of light is done by using focusing optics .",
    "how tight the focusing will be , depends on the numerical aperture of the focusing optics that is given by @xmath42}$ ] , where @xmath43 is the half - opening angle of the optics aperture and @xmath44 is the refractive index of the surrounding medium . for high",
    "_ na _ objectives , the exact dependence of the focal volume as a function of _ na _ can only be calculated numerically incorporating a vectorial treatment of the electric field .",
    "but as the numerical aperture increases , the focal volume will basically decrease .    for a 4@xmath0  focusing optic ,",
    "the numerical aperture is no longer defined .",
    "nevertheless , it seems obvious that diffraction limited focusing from more than half of the hemisphere would produce a smaller three - dimensional focal volume .",
    "consequently , a different quantity has to be used for comparing the performance of different 4@xmath0  focusing optics .",
    "one suitable quantity is the weighted solid angle @xmath45 $ ] ( normalized to @xmath46 ) @xcite .",
    "it is the solid angle that is covered by the focusing optics weighted by the dipole s angular irradiance pattern .",
    "@xmath47 defines the maximum fraction of incident power that can be coupled into the dipole mode of a single emitter .",
    "consequently , it provides information about the ability to concentrate light since an electric dipole mode achieves the highest possible energy concentration @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 therefore means , that all of the light is coupled into the dipole mode , assuming the ideal radiation pattern .",
    "the focusing capabilities of such a focusing optics can not be exceeded by any other optics . in figure",

    "one has @xmath50 . the same fraction of the weighted solid angle can be covered using two opposing objective lenses each having a _ na _ of 0.997 in vacuum .",
    "high quality objectives of such high numerical aperture are , however , not available .    in the experiment ,",
    "the weighted solid angle covered by the focusing optics is one quantity that determines the measured light - matter coupling efficiency .",
    "other important experimental factors are the optical aberrations and the spatial extent of the ion , respectively .",
    "under ideal conditions , we expect a coupling efficiency of @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the field overlap with the ideal dipole mode@xcite .",
    "but in our measurements , we are not able to reach this limit .",
    "our numerical simulations imply , however , that we are currently not primarily limited by the covered solid angle , but by the spatial extent of the ion and the optical aberrations ( see table [ tab : ionsize ] ) .    enhancing the optical properties of our focusing system and",
    "therefore also the coupling efficiency can be done by correcting for the aberrations .",
    "the predominant aberrations in our set - up are due to form deviations of the mirror from the ideal parabolic shape . a higher degree of form accuracy could be provided by including interferometric measurement techniques @xcite into the mirror s production process .",
    "alternatively , the aberrations can be corrected by preshaping the incident wavefront before it enters the parabolic mirror .",
    "wavefront shaping techniques may rely on adaptive optical elements ( _ e.g. _ liquid crystal display , deformable mirror ) or a ( gray tone ) phase plate .",
    "the latter technique has already been tested for a 4@xmath0-pm of the same geometry as used here@xcite . involving a second optical element for wavefront correction in front of the parabolic mirror",
    "would only slightly add complexity to the system .",
    "if the corrective element is reflection and refraction based , like a continuous membrane deformable mirror is , the wavelength - independent character of the imaging system is retained .",
    "the wavelength - independent character is the reason why the 4@xmath0-pm is intrinsically free of chromatic aberrations .",
    "this is beneficial for applications that require tight focusing not only for a monochromatic light source .",
    "typical applications can be found in the field of microscopy : confocal fluorescence microscopy @xcite usually requires correction for the excitation and the detection wavelength ; resolft - type far - field nanoscopy @xcite in addition requires correction for the depletion beam .",
    "further examples are two- and three - photon microscopy @xcite or raman microscopy @xcite .",
    "the variety of reflective materials allows to specialize the 4@xmath0-pm for a specific application , _",
    "e.g. _ for high power applications , high sensitivity measurements or even for applications where wavelengths from the deep uv to the far ir are used at the same time",
    ". this ability may enable new illumination or imaging techniques that are not possible with today s technology .",

    "we experimentally characterized a light - matter interface based on a 4@xmath0-pm . by limiting its aperture",
    ", we could demonstrate an effective excitation _ psf _ having a lateral spot size of @xmath33 nm in vacuum .",
    "that corresponds to @xmath53 . using the full mirror we observed a strong splitting of the focal peak along the axial direction due to form deviations of the parabolic mirror . measuring the induced aberrations interferometrically and including the results in numerical simulations yields values that are consistent with the experiment .",
    "in addition , we measured the light - matter coupling efficiency to be @xmath54 .",
    "this value is also in good agreement with our simulations .",
    "our findings allow us to infer that we are currently limited by the aberrations of the parabolic mirror and the spatial extent of the ion .",
    "we can surpass our current technical limitations by correcting the aberrations of the 4@xmath0-pm .",
    "this would even further reduce the focal spot size and increase the coupling efficiency .",
    "ways for wavefront correction were given in the discussion section of this work .",
    "we also may apply higher trap frequencies or ground state cooling techniques to reduce the spatial extent of the ion .",
    "alternatively , we can trap doubly ionized ytterbium in our experimental set - up @xcite .",
    "when trapping a @xmath55 ion we may not need to change the trapping or cooling techniques because the ion s spatial extent is smaller in the doppler limit ( higher charge , narrower transition linewidth ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath55 provides a closed two - level transition that is desirable in many experiments on the fundamentals of light - matter interaction .",
    "this may be a path for realizing a set - up capable of reaching the ultimate limitations of focusing in free space @xcite .",

    "we simulate the focal intensity distribution along the principal axes of our system ( x , y , z ) based on a generalization of the method presented in @xcite including the aberrations of our parabolic mirror .",
    "the resulting intensity distributions are convolved with the spatial extent of the ion along the corresponding trap axis .",
    "thus we obtain the motionally induced reduction of the average intensity of the light interacting with the ion for each spatial direction individually .",
    "the values obtained for each direction are multiplied .",
    "the same procedure is repeated for an aberration - free parabolic mirror and a point - like ion .",
    "division of these two values and multiplication of the result with the field overlap @xmath56 @xcite of the donut mode yields the expected coupling efficiency .    for determining the spatial extent of the doppler cooled ion ,",
