    "the study of minimal representation - infinite @xmath0-algebras with @xmath0 an algebraically closed field was one of the central themes of the representation theory around 1984 with contributions by bautista , gabriel , roiter , salmeron , bongartz , fischbacher and many others .",
    "recent investigations of bongartz @xcite provide a new impetus for analyzing the module category of such an algebra and seem to yield a basis for a classification of these algebras .",
    "here is a short summery of this development .",
    "first of all , there are algebras with a non - distributive ideal lattice , such algebras have been studied already 1957 by jans @xcite .",
    "second , there are algebras with a good universal cover @xmath1 and such that @xmath1 has a convex subcategory which is a tame concealed algebra of type @xmath2 or @xmath3 these were the algebras which have been discussed by bautista , gabriel , roiter and salmeron in @xcite ( we say that the universal cover is _ good _ provided it is a galois cover with free galois group and is interval - finite ) .",
    "as bongartz now has shown , the remaining minimal representation - infinite algebras also have a good cover @xmath1 , but all finite convex subcategories of @xmath1 are representation - finite .",
    "these are the algebras which will be discussed here .",
    "we will show that such an algebra is special biserial and we will provide a full classification of the special biserial algebras which are minimal representation - infinite .",
    "let us recall the definition : a finite dimensional @xmath0-algebra is said to be _ special biserial _",
    "( see @xcite ) provided it is morita equivalent to the path algebra of a quiver @xmath4 with relations with the following properties :    \\(1 ) any vertex of @xmath4 is endpoint of at most two arrows , and also starting point of at most two arrows .",
    "\\(2 ) if two different arrows @xmath5 and @xmath6 start in the endpoint of the arrow @xmath7 , then at least one of the paths @xmath8 is a relation .",
    "( 2@xmath9 ) if two different arrows @xmath7 and @xmath10 end in the starting point of the arrow @xmath5 , then at least one of the paths @xmath11 is a relation .    note that the composition of an arrow @xmath7 with endpoint @xmath12 and an arrow @xmath5 with starting point @xmath12 is here denoted by @xmath13 , one should visualize the situation as follows : @xmath14 from 0.8 0.8 to 0.2 0.2    \\arrow < 1.5 mm >   [ 0.25,0.75 ] from 1.8 1.8 to 1.2 1.2    \\put{$\\alpha$ } at 1.7 1.3 \\put{$\\gamma$ } at 0.7 0.3 \\endpicture}\\ ] ]    the definition of a special biserial algebra looks quite technical , but actually there are a lot of natural examples of algebras which turn out to be of this kind .",
    "note that a special biserial algebra is hereditary if and only if it is morita equivalent to the path algebra of a quiver of type @xmath15 or @xmath16 , where the cyclic orientation of @xmath17 has to be excluded in order to get a finite dimensional algebra .",
    "special biserial algebras were first studied by gelfand and ponomarev @xcite : they have provided the methods in order to classify all the indecomposable representations of such an algebra .",
    "this classification shows that special biserial algebras are always tame ( see also @xcite ) and usually they are of non - polynomial growth .",
    "for the structure of the auslander - reiten quiver of a special biserial algebra we refer to @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to describe the special biserial algebras which are minimal representation - infinite and to exhibit the corresponding module categories .",
    "we can assume that the defining relations of the special biserial algebras to be considered are monomials ( since otherwise we will obtain an indecomposable module which is both projective and injective , but minimal representation - infinite algebras do not have indecomposable modules which are both projective and injective ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is a finite dimensional algebra , a simple module @xmath19 is said to be a _",
    "provided @xmath19 is neither projective nor injective , and such that @xmath19 does not occur as a composition factor of a module of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is indecomposable and not simple .",
    "if @xmath18 is given by a quiver with relations , then the simple module @xmath22 corresponding to a vertex @xmath12 is a node if and only if @xmath12 is neither a sink nor a source and given an arrow @xmath7 which ends in @xmath12 and an arrow @xmath5 which starts in @xmath12 , then @xmath13 is a relation .",
    "there is a well - known procedure @xcite to resolve nodes : for any algebra @xmath18 , there is an algebra @xmath23 without nodes such that @xmath18 and @xmath23 are stably equivalent : in case @xmath18 is given by a quiver with relations , one just replaces any vertex @xmath12 with @xmath22 a node by two vertices @xmath24 such that @xmath25 is a sink and @xmath26 a source .",
    "a vertex @xmath12 of a quiver will be called an _ @xmath27-vertex _ provided",
    "@xmath12 has @xmath27 neighbors ( this means that there are @xmath28 arrows ending in @xmath12 and @xmath29 arrows starting in @xmath12 and @xmath30 ; observe that in this way , the loops at @xmath12 are counted twice ) .",
    "assume the @xmath0-algebra @xmath18 is special biserial and minimal representation - infinite .",
    "then any @xmath31-vertex of the quiver of @xmath18 is a node .    if we want to classify algebras which are minimal representation - infinite , it is sufficient to deal with algebras without a node , since an algebra @xmath18 is minimal representation - infinite if and only if the node - free algebra @xmath23 is minimal representation - infinite , see section 7 .",
    "a finite dimensional hereditary algebra of type @xmath32 will be said to be a _",
    "cycle algebra_. the main task of the paper will be to define two classes of finite dimensional algebras , the so - called barbell algebras and wind wheel algebras , see sections 5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "these algebras are obtained from cycle algebras by a construction which we call barification ( see section 4 ) and adding , if necessary , suitable zero relations .    the special biserial algebras which are minimal representation - infinite and have no nodes are the cycle algebras , the barbell algebras with non - serial bars and the wind wheel algebras .",
    "a minimal representation - infinite algebra is special biserial if and only if its universal cover @xmath33 is good and any finite convex subcategory of @xmath33 is representation - finite .",
    "the first part of these notes is devoted to a proof of theorems 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 .",
    "the second part provides information on the module categories of the minimal representation - infinite special biserial algebras .",
    "as we have mentioned already , all special biserial algebras are tame .",
    "dealing with the minimal representation - infinite ones , we encounter both algebras of non - polynomial growth ( namely the barbell algebras ) as well as domestic ones ( the hereditary algebras of type @xmath32 as well as all the wind wheel algebras ) , note that the domestic ones all are even @xmath34-domestic . here",
    ", an algebra is said to be _",
    "@xmath27-domestic _ in case there are precisely @xmath27 primitive 1-parameter family of indecomposable modules ( and additional `` isolated '' indecomposables ) .",
    "not much is known about domestic algebras @xmath18 in general , not even about 1-domestic algebras ! the wind wheel algebras @xmath35 provide new examples of @xmath34-domestic algebras such that the auslander - reiten quiver has an arbitrary finite number of non - regular components ( 12.5 ) as well as having non - regular components with arbitrary ramification ( 12.6 ) .",
    "let us stress that the examples which we present all have loewy length @xmath36 .    also , we will describe in detail the corresponding auslander - reiten quilt @xmath37 of a wind wheel",
    ", it is obtained from the set of auslander - reiten components which contain string modules by inserting suitable infinite dimensional algebraically compact indecomposable modules .",
    "we will see that @xmath37 is a connected orientable surface with boundary , its euler characteristic is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of bars .    a further property of the wind wheels @xmath35 with @xmath39 bars seems to be of interest : let @xmath21 be a primitive homogeneous and absolutely indecomposable @xmath35-module , and @xmath40 the factor ring of @xmath41 modulo the ideal of endomorphisms with semisimple image , then @xmath40 is of dimension @xmath42 , thus arbitrarily large .",
    "in general , we will show : let @xmath18 be a @xmath0-algebra which is minimal representation - infinite and special biserial .",
    "then any complete sectional path is a mono ray , an epi coray or the concatenation of an epi coray with a mono ray .",
    "this implies in particular the following : if @xmath43 are indecomposable @xmath18-modules with an irreducible monomorphism @xmath44 and an irreducible epimorphism @xmath45 , then @xmath46    whereas we present in part i full proofs for the main results , the discussion in part ii is less complete , several of the ( sometimes tedious ) combinatorial verifications are left to the reader",

    "given a quiver @xmath4 with vertex set @xmath47 and arrow set @xmath48 and a set @xmath49 of monomial relations ( monomial relations are paths of length at least 2 ) , we consider ( usually finite ) words using as letters the arrows of the quivers and formal inverses of these arrows , the set of such words will be denoted by @xmath50 ( and just by @xmath51 if no relations are given ) . in case the algebra @xmath52 is given by the quiver @xmath4 with relations @xmath49 , we also dare to write @xmath53 instead of @xmath50 ( but this is an abuse of notation ) .    here is the proper definition : let @xmath54 be the quiver obtained from @xmath4 by adding formal inverses of the arrows ( given an arrow @xmath7 with starting point @xmath55 and terminal point @xmath56 we denote by @xmath57 a formal inverse of @xmath58 with starting point @xmath59 and terminal point @xmath60 given such a formal inverse @xmath61 one writes @xmath62 ) .",

    "the elements of @xmath50 will be called _ words _ for the quiver @xmath4 with the relations @xmath49 , the arrows and their formal inverses will be called the _ letters_.",

    "the center @xmath647 is the vertex @xmath648 , the vertices on the diagonals ( some are marked by @xmath499 ) are the pairs @xmath649 and @xmath650 with @xmath651 . in a rather obvious way , we can consider @xmath652 also as a translation quiver and as in @xcite we will call it a _ tile _ , see the following picture on the left : @xmath653 the middle picture presents the translation subquiver @xmath654 obtained from the left picture by deleting the diagonals through the center .",
    "it may be considered as the disjoint union of four parts , the _ quarters _ * i , ii , iii , iv , * see the right picture . here , we also have marked the four _ corners _ using circles .",
    "given any bar @xmath236 , we obtain such a tile by considering all the ( finite or infinite ) words containing the completed bar @xmath514 , thus by considering all the ( finite or infinite ) subwords of @xmath485 .",
    "the word @xmath485 itself will be the center of the tile , the infinite words form the diagonals through the center . if we look only at the finite words , we obtain in this way the four quarters .    as we have seen in @xcite",
    ", tiles can occur as hammocks ( the bridges in @xcite yield such a hammock ) . here",
    "we encounter a different situation where tiles appear .",
    "the tiles which occur when dealing with minimal representation - finite special biserial algebras have the special property that all the irreducible maps in the quarter * i * are monomorphisms , whereas those in the quarter * iii * are epimorphisms .",
    "there is one bar @xmath236 , thus one tile @xmath590 .",

    "this means that @xmath764 is @xmath36-calabi - yau , and indeed @xmath27-calabi - yau for any @xmath27 .",
    "since the module category of a barbell algebra shares so many properties with the module category of a cluster tilted algebra , one may wonder whether also for a barbell algebra @xmath18 the module category @xmath745 is obtained from a triangulated category @xmath773 by forming @xmath774 for some object @xmath775 in @xmath776 . as idun reiten has pointed out , this is indeed the case if we deal with a barbell algebra @xmath18 with two loops ( as in our running example 2 ) provided we assume that the characteristic of @xmath0 is different from @xmath36 : such an algebra is 2-cy - tilted ( this means : the endomorphism ring of some cluster tilting object of a 2-calabi - yau category , @xcite ) .",
    "namely , if @xmath18 is a barbell algebra with two loops @xmath777 in its quiver @xmath4 and if the characteristic of @xmath0 is different from @xmath36 , then @xmath18 is the jacobian algebra @xmath778 , where @xmath35 is the potential @xmath779 , see @xcite , thus one can apply theorem 3.6 of amiot @xcite .",
    "recall that a ( finite or infinite ) path @xmath780 in the auslander - reiten quiver of a finite dimensional algebra is called _ sectional _ provided @xmath781 is not isomorphic to @xmath782 for all possible @xmath712 .",
    "such a path will be called _",
    "maximal _ provided it is not a proper subpath of some sectional path .",
    "an infinite sectional path involving only monomorphisms will be called a _ mono ray , _ an infinite path involving only epimorphisms will be called an _ epi coray ; _ of course , mono rays start with some module , epi corays end in a module .    note that for auslander - reiten components of the form @xmath783 as well as for stable tubes , all maximal sectional paths are mono rays and epi corays .",
    "let @xmath18 be a @xmath0-algebra which is minimal representation - infinite and special biserial .",
    "then any maximal sectional path is a mono ray , an epi coray or the concatenation of an epi coray with a mono ray .",
    "assume that @xmath18 is minimal representation - infinite and special biserial .",
    "let @xmath43 be indecomposable @xmath18-modules with an irreducible monomorphism @xmath784 and an irreducible epimorphism @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath785    we may assume that there are no nodes : namely , if all the sectional paths of @xmath23 are as mentioned , the same has to be true for @xmath18 : the only maximal sectional paths for @xmath18 to be looked at are those passing through the node .",
    "resolving the node we will obtain sectional paths which are not double infinite paths , thus by the assumption on @xmath23 , we will deal with an epi coray ending in the node and a mono ray starting in the node , thus with a concatenation as listed .",
    "if @xmath18 is hereditary of type @xmath16 , thus a cycle algebra , then any maximal sectional path is a mono ray , an epi coray .",
    "we only have to look at the preprojective component and the preinjective component .",
    "but if @xmath786 is a non - zero map between indecomposable preprojective modules , then @xmath706 has to be always a monomorphism : otherwise , the kernel of @xmath706 would have negative defect , and since the defect of @xmath460 is @xmath787 , it would follow that the image of @xmath706 is a non - zero submodule of @xmath788 with non - negative defect , a contradiction .",
    "the dual argument shows that the maximal sectional paths in the preinjective component are epi corays .",
    "next , let us look at the wind wheels : again , only the non - regular components have to be considered .",
    "but we know how to construct these components : we use mono rays from the preprojective component and the tube @xmath457 as well as epi corays from the tube @xmath451 and from the preinjective component , and in addition rays and corays in the tiles .",
    "but all the maximal sectional paths in the four quarters of a tile are mono rays and epi corays ( in the quarter * i * we have only mono rays , in * iii * only epi corays , whereas * ii * and * iv * have both mono rays and epi corays .",
    "finally , let us look at the barbells .",
    "there is only one non - regular component which has to be treated separately .",
    "the band modules lie in homogeneous tubes and there will be an additional regular tube containing string modules .",
    "what really is of interest are the remaining components @xmath773 , they are of the form @xmath789 .",
    "let us look at the example 2 ( the general case is similar ) .",
    "let @xmath790 be the gei module ( @xcite ) for @xmath773 ( it is the unique module in @xmath773 of minimal length ) and one easily observes that @xmath157 is a word of the form @xmath791 .",
    "it is easy to see that all the modules @xmath792 for @xmath793 are obtained from @xmath794 by adding hooks both on the left and on the right ; similarly , all the modules @xmath795 for @xmath793 are obtained from @xmath796 by adding cohooks both on the left and on the right . but",
    "this implies that all the maximal sectional paths in @xmath773 are concatenation of an epi coray with a mono ray .",
