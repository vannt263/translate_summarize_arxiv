    "the @xmath1 is a well - established hyperon resonance located just below @xmath4 threshold .",
    "even though its existence has been known since the 1960 s and it holds a four - star rating in the pdg  @xcite , its nature as a resonance is not well understood .",
    "the @xmath1 can only be seen by reconstructing the invariant mass of the @xmath2 system into which it decays .",
    "previous experiments  @xcite have shown this mass distribution , or `` lineshape '' to be distorted from the usual breit - wigner resonance form , leading to various speculations on the nature of the @xmath1 .    using the clas  @xcite detector system in hall b at the thomas jefferson national accelerator laboratory",
    ", we have done a photoproduction measurement of the @xmath1 . due to the high statistics of the experiment and good resolution of the clas system",
    ", we were able to extract the lineshapes and differential cross sections of the @xmath1 in all three of its @xmath2 decay modes .",
    "the lineshapes and cross sections will give a much improved quantitative description of the @xmath1 , and will lead to further insights into its nature and production mechanism .",
    "in recent years , theoretical progress in chiral dynamics in the @xmath5 sector has gained much attention , and has been extended to include a description of the @xmath1 . in this approach",
    "the @xmath1 is dynamically generated by iterating over the meson - baryon interactions among the ground state baryon octet and psuedoscalar mesons octet .",
    "a paper by nacher _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite predicts , using a chiral unitary approach , the lineshapes of the @xmath1 as it decays to its three @xmath2 decay modes .",
    "figure  [ fig : theorylineshape ] shows the predicted lineshapes , a result of the isospin @xmath6 and @xmath7 amplitudes interfering to produce shifts in the @xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath11 lineshapes in opposite directions . unlike an ordinary resonance where the lineshape will follow a simple breit - wigner form , the @xmath1 spectrum is predicted to be strongly distorted due to a mixture of contributions .",
    "this figure has been the starting point in our analysis , and our work has been focused on comparing our experimental data with this prediction .",
    "in this section we show some of the work that was done at clas to study the photoproduction of the @xmath1 .",
    "the reaction of interest at clas is @xmath12 , with the @xmath1 decaying exclusively into @xmath2 .",
    "the clas data set was obtained in 2004 using tagged real photons up to @xmath13 gev , and a two charged track trigger . for the @xmath8@xmath9 decay mode , there are two possible decays for the @xmath8 , i.e. to @xmath14@xmath15or n @xmath11 . the first step of the analysis is to select either @xmath16 or @xmath17 events .",
    "after the three charged particles are selected and identified using momentum and tof information , the missing mass of the event is calculated to obtain the missing particle(s ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : case3mm2 ] shows an example of the missing mass squared ( @xmath18 ) for one bin of our analysis .",
    "a gaussian fit to the neutron peak had a @xmath19 cut applied .",
    "next , we combine our final state particles to reconstruct the intermediate ground state hyperon that the reaction went through . in figure",
    "[ fig : case3cross ] we show the result of plotting the invariant masses squared of the ( n , @xmath11 ) versus ( n , @xmath9 ) . again a fit was done and a region of @xmath20 was selected around each peak",
    "; the @xmath21 overlap region was excluded as well .",
    "[ fig : analysisplots ]    at this stage we are ready to fit our resulting @xmath2 spectrum as a sum of templates of monte carlo ( mc ) spectra .",
    "the mc were initially generated with mass and width values given in the pdg  @xcite and processed through the standard clas simulation package to account for detection ineffeciencies .",
    "after this fitting process , the non-@xmath1 contributions were subtracted off from the data and the `` residual '' spectrum was taken to be from the @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting lineshape was then acceptance corrected bin by bin in mass .",
    "the final lineshape spectrum was then obtained by summing over all the production angle bins in each energy bin .",
    "our final lineshapes are thus shown this way , acceptance corrected and summed over all production angles .",
    "once the above process of fitting and obtaining the lineshapes in each energy bin was completed , the resulting lineshapes were then used as input to generate mc templates for the @xmath1 , so that the process could be iterated and refined . the fit result in one sample bin is shown in figure [ fig : lineshapefit ] for the iterated version .",
    "after the iteration of the fit , the mass distribution we obtained is shown in figure  [ fig : lineshape ] for one energy bin near threshold of the @xmath1 .",
    "our lineshape result is shown for the three different charge combinations @xmath8@xmath9(red ) , @xmath22@xmath15(blue ) , and @xmath10@xmath11 ( green ) .",
    "the @xmath8@xmath9 spectrum is a weighted average of the two different decay channels of the @xmath8 .",
    "the difference in the lineshapes is clear , with the @xmath8@xmath9 spectrum peaking at the highest mass , and having a much sharper structure than the @xmath10@xmath11 spectrum .    [",
    "fig : fitandresult ]    a comparison of our experimental result can be done with the theoretical prediction ( figure  [ fig : theorylineshape ] ) .",
    "although the lineshapes differ from each other as predicted , we see that for the theory prediction , the @xmath10@xmath11 spectrum is shifted toward the higher mass , whereas this applies to the @xmath8@xmath9 spectrum in our experimental result .",
    "the difference in the two charged decay modes , according to the theory , is based on an interference between isospin @xmath23 and @xmath24 terms , as shown in @xcite . at the moment , this `` interchange '' of lineshapes is an unresolved issue that we hope to resolve in future studies .",
    "the mass distributions of the @xmath1 have been obtained in nine different energy bins , and although much work has been put into obtaining these , there is still room for improvement .",
    "one example of prospective work is using the kinematic fitter that was developed for clas .",
    "the results shown here do not utilize the kinematic fitter , but our preliminary studies show that our resolution is readily improved when using it .",
    "preliminary differential cross sections for the @xmath1 were also shown during the presentation , which were obtained by summing over each lineshape in each energy and angle bin .",
    "the values of this @xmath3showed differences between the different charge combinations , not just in scale but also in dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "the nature of this different @xmath25-dependence for each decay mode is unknown .",
    "another prospect for our analysis is direct experimental evidence for the spin and parity of the @xmath1 .",
    "although the majority of theories assume @xmath26 , no direct experimental proof for these quantum numbers has been given  @xcite .",
    "our preliminary analysis shows a detectable polarization for the @xmath1 , which is transferred to the @xmath8 , allowing us to infer its spin and parity .",
    "our results are consistent with the common expectation , but will nontheless be an important step in identifying the nature of the @xmath1 . also , it should be noted that from these measurements the polarization of the @xmath1 is measured , giving further information about its production mechanism .    in conclusion , an overview of the clas analysis of the @xmath1 has been given .",
    "we have an unprecedented high statistics data set for the @xmath1 , and have obtained the lineshapes and differential cross sections in energy bins spanning from threshold up to @xmath27 gev in the overall center of mass energy .",
    "we observe a difference in the different decay mode lineshapes , leading to a difference in the differential cross sections .",
    "we have just started comparing our results to theory , and are eager to finalize our results in the coming months .      c.  amsler _ et al . _",
