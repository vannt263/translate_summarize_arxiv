    "recent studies reveal that the structural inhomogeneity plays an important role in critical phenomena on complex networks  @xcite .",
    "however , in the study of the critical phenomena , systems with quenched disorder have received little attention with only a few exceptions  @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the effect of quenched disorder and structural inhomogeneity on the nature of a phase transition . for this purpose , we study a disorder - driven phase transition in the random field ising model  ( rfim ) on scale - free  ( sf ) networks .",
    "a sf network is characterized by the power - law degree distribution @xmath3 with the degree exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the power - law distribution indicates that sf networks have an inhomogeneous structure and the degree exponent @xmath0 determines the strength of the inhomogeneity in structure .",
    "the rfim has attracted much attention in statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "being compared with the spin glass model where the quenched disorder is present in the interaction among spins  @xcite , the rfim has a quenched random external magnetic field applied to each site .",
    "the quenched disorder leads to a phase transition from an ordered ferromagnetic phase to a disordered paramagnetic phase . in spite of the simpler structure of the rfim than the spin glass model ,",

    "the external magnetic field , however , tends to pin each spin to a random direction .",
    "the competition between them may lead to a phase transition , which will be investigated at zero temperature using mean - field theory . in the framework of the mean - field theory , each spin @xmath22",
