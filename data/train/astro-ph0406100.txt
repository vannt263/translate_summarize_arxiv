    "rcw  49 is one of the most luminous and massive regions in the galaxy . at its center",
    "lies the westerlund  2 ( hereafter w2 ; westerlund 1960 ) compact cluster which contains over a dozen ob stars and a wolf - rayet star ; another wolf - rayet star lies several arc minutes away in the extended nebula ( moffat & vogt 1975 ; moffat , shara , & potter 1991 ; carraro & munari 2004 ; van der hucht 2001 ) .",
    "the age of the w2 cluster is estimated to be 2 - 3 myr ( piatti et al . 1998 ) . as discussed in churchwell et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter , c04 ) , distance estimates range from @xmath1 kpc and we follow their adoption of 4.2 kpc . at this distance",
    ", we estimate the cluster luminosity is 1.4@xmath2  @xmath3 based on the iras flux and a relationship derived between far - infrared and bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass is estimated to be @xmath4m@xmath5 from the radio - derived ionizing flux @xcite the rcw  49 region was observed with the _ spitzer _ ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",

    "* ) observing strategy validation .",
    "c04 presents irac images of this region that show highly - structured , extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) and gas emission , extending out to @xmath13  from the w2 cluster center .",
    "the pah emission is likely excited by the strong ultraviolet / optical radiation from the central w2 cluster ( leger & puget 1984 ; allamandola et al .",
    "1989 ) , suggesting that large regions of the cloud are optically thin to the central cluster radiation .",
    "furthermore , radio and infrared imaging show that at least the southwest part of the cloud is blown out @xcite ( all directions in this paper are referred to in galactic coordinates ) . without detailed studies of the molecular gas in the rcw 49 region , it is unknown if dense cores of gas and dust remain or if the dust is optically thin .",
    "has star formation ceased and is the cloud in the process of disruption ? or is star formation ongoing , perhaps triggered by winds and shocks from the central cluster ?",
    "this paper presents irac photometry of the rcw  49 region which reveals several hundred sources with large infrared excesses , likely indicating youth . after discussing the observations in  2",
    ", we present images of selected regions in  3 and color - color and color - magnitude diagrams in  4 . in ",
    "5 we show spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of two massive ( b2 ) ysos .  6 concludes with a discussion of the current generation of star formation and how it may relate to the w2 cluster .",
    "the observations are described in detail in c04 .",
    "a 1.7@xmath14x0.7@xmath14 region was imaged ten times with 1.2  s exposures in the four irac bands",
    ". we will refer to these bands by their central wavelength in @xmath15 m , i.e. , [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] , and [ 8.0 ] . the data were taken on 2003 december 23 ( spitzer program i d 195 ) , and were processed by the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) pipeline ( version s9.0.1 ) .",
    "positional accuracies are better than 1  ( werner et al . 2004 ) .",
    "point source full - width - half - max resolutions range from @xmath161.6  at [ 3.6 ] to @xmath161.9  at [ 8.0 ] .",
    "the data were further processed by the glimpse pipeline @xcite : point sources were extracted from each frame using a modified version of daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , and cross - referenced using the ssc bandmerger .",
    "we produced a catalog of all sources detected at least 8 out of 10 times in any of the four irac bands .",
    "for this present study , we culled the catalog to include only those sources with signal - to - noise greater than 10 in any band .",
    "we estimate the photometric errors from simulations by placing point sources on a realistic background ( using the rcw  49 diffuse flux after stars are subtracted out ) and comparing the processed photometry to the input values .",
    "the root - mean - square errors are @xmath170.05 mag in bands [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] for sources brighter than 13 and 12.5 magnitude , respectively ; @xmath170.07 mag in band [ 5.8 ] and @xmath170.15 mag in band [ 8.0 ] for sources brighter than 11.7 magnitude .",
    "only sources brighter than these magnitudes ( in a given band ) are displayed in the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams in  4 .",
    "the flux calibration was checked against five early a - type dwarf stars , and agrees to within 7% in all irac bands with the calculated fluxes ( cohen et al .",
    "2003 , kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "figure  [ 3col ] shows a 3-color image mosaic at k@xmath18 , [ 3.6 ] , and [ 4.5 ] @xmath15 m ( the k@xmath18-band image is a mosaic of 2mass images ) . the [ 3.6 ] band diffuse emission ( in green )",
    "is dominated by pahs and small grains ; [ 4.5 ] emission ( red ) is mostly hydrogen br@xmath19 and small grains ( c04 ) ; and k@xmath18-band ( blue ) is likely br@xmath20 and perhaps dust scattering .",
    "main sequence stars appear blue in these images .",
    "the boxed regions in figure  [ 3col ] are shown to larger scale in figure  [ regions ] .",
    "the top left panel of figure  [ regions ] shows the w2 cluster .",
    "this cluster contains five o7v stars , one o6v , and a wn7 star ( moffat et al .",
    "1991 ) . the bright star about 1  northwest of the cluster marked by the arrow is an o7 supergiant ( moffat et al .",
    "1991 ) . winds from the w2 cluster have produced for a radio ring about 4  in radius centered on the cluster @xcite .",
    "the second region ( region 2 ) is 3.4  sw of the w2 center . as discussed in  5 ,",
    "the bright red source and diffuse green source ( marked ) are likely massive ( b3 ) ysos .",
    "this cluster resides ( in projection ) in the `` blow - out '' region of the rcw  49 nebula where the radio ring is disrupted and winds and uv radiation are probably escaping ( whiteoak & uchida 1997 ; c04 , figure  1 ) .",
    "the third highlighted region , at 4.3  se of w2 , contains a column of material similar to the elephant trunks of m16 ( hester et al .",
    "the red star at the tip of the elephant trunk is a strong ir emitter ; and the bright red star to the se is likely a massive yso since it has similar flux and colors to the two sources discussed in  5 . to the north at the edge of the image",
    "lies the second known wolf - rayet star in the rcw  49 nebula ( moffat et al . 1991 ) .",
    "it is thought to be responsible for a second radio bubble @xcite .",
    "the fourth region is located 7.7  se of w2 .",
    "it contains several faint , red sources and dark lanes .",
    "region  5 is located 7.8  e of w2 , and region  6 is located 9.1  south of w2 and each contains a small group of red sources .",
    "region  6 is located on the perimeter of the blow - out region .",
    "these images of clustered red sources and dark lanes suggest that star formation is taking place throughout the rcw  49 nebula .",
    "we next examine stellar photometry of the entire region to determine if this is indeed the case .",
    "figure  [ ccd ] shows color - color plots of the rcw  49 region ( green circles ) , and a `` field '' region of similar area about 0.75  to the north ( pink circles ) centered at ( l , b)=(284.18,0.41 ) . the black cross at upper right in each panel shows typical error bars for each color sequence .",
    "the black arrows show reddening vectors derived from optical / near - ir extinction studies of the diffuse ism ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) , and the grey arrows show reddening vectors derived from this dataset ( indebetouw et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "note that the length of the arrows in the top left panel represent an optical extinction of a@xmath21 whereas the length of the arrows in the other three panels show a@xmath22 .",
    "the black symbols represent colors from models of 1 million year old sources ( using siess et al . 2000 evolutionary tracks for central source temperatures and luminosity ) surrounded by varying amounts of circumstellar gas and dust ( @xmath23 - 10 m@xmath24 ) .",
    "the models were computed using a radiative transfer code that calculates emission from envelopes , disks and outflows surrounding stars @xcite .",
    "the model central star masses are 2.5 , 3.8 , and 5.9  m@xmath24 , corresponding to luminosities of 10  l@xmath24 ( filled circles ) , 100  l@xmath24 ( x s ) , and 730  l@xmath24 ( open triangles ) . the 2mass catalog was used to create the near - ir color sequence in the top left panel of figure  [ ccd ] .",
    "only stars brighter than 14th magnitude in all three bands are plotted since the errors increase below this .",
    "the near - ir color sequence is typical of a star formation region .",
    "the field stars ( pink ) follow the reddening line .",
    "the stars that are very red or below the reddening line are usually classified as ir excess sources with disks or envelopes .",
    "however , many ir excess sources lie along the reddening line and are difficult to distinguish from reddened main sequence stars . in contrast , the other panels in figure  [ ccd ] using irac data show that infrared - excess sources in rcw  49 are well separated from field stars , which generally have a small color range . comparing the colors of the rcw  49 stars to the field stars",
    ", we find that 357 stars out of 1393 in rcw  49 have colors [ 3.6]-[4.5]@xmath25 mag , [ 4.5]-[5.8]@xmath26 mag , or [ 5.8]-[8.0]@xmath25 mag compared to 21/1114 in the field ( about 2% ) .",
    "we note that due to our conservative brightness limits for this initial study , many of the faint stars apparent in the images in figure  [ regions ] are not included in the color - color plots .",
    "even so , it is likely that at least 300 of the sources in this dataset are surrounded by warm circumstellar dust which indicates that they have recently formed or are in the process of formation .",
    "figure  [ cmd ] shows color - magnitude diagrams of the rcw  49 region ( green circles ) and the northern field ( pink ) .",
    "the model symbols ( black ) are as described in figure  [ ccd ] .",
    "the width of the field star distribution matches reasonably well to the error bars at upper right .",
    "the horizontal dashed line in each panel shows the expected brightness of a b5 main sequence star at a distance of 4.2 kpc ( synthesized from the 2 - 35@xmath15 m spectra of cohen , 1993 ) .",
    "based on the number of ysos more luminous than this ( about 300 ) , and assuming a fairly standard imf @xcite , we estimate the total number of ysos to be @xmath277000 and their total mass to be @xmath274500  m@xmath5 .    where is most of the star formation occuring in this cloud ?",
    "figure  [ radial ] plots the fraction of red sources as a function of radius from the w2 cluster center , where red is defined as [ 3.6]-[4.5]@xmath25 mag , [ 4.5]-[5.8]@xmath26 mag , and [ 5.8]-[8.0]@xmath28 mag ( based on the color - magnitude diagrams of figure  [ cmd ] ) .",
    "this distribution peaks within about 4  ( @xmath29 pc ) from the w2 cluster center , and decreases beyond that .",
    "the diffuse emission has a similar distribution ( c04 , figure 3 ) suggesting the possibility of a systematic bias towards finding red stars due to higher [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] backgrounds .",
    "however , the density of total stars ( of all colors ) as a function of radius is fairly constant beyond about 2 suggesting that we are seeing the entire population of stars above our magnitude limits .",
    "the correlation between the red stars and the diffuse flux is probably real and due to higher diffuse flux in regions of higher star formation activity .",
    "we conclude from this plot that star formation is occurring preferentially within about 4  ( @xmath30 pc ) from the w2 cluster center and decreases beyond that .",
    "interestingly , this is the approximate outer radius of the radio ring @xcite and the `` plateau region '' of the diffuse flux ( c04 , figure 3 ) where it is thought that winds and radiation have swepted up and compressed gas and dust .",
    "this may have produced conditions for a second generation of star formation .",
    "since the medium is not smooth , the induced star formation likely occurs over a range of radii .",
    "the ysos in region 2 ( figures 1 and 2 ) and the elephant trunk in region 3 fall within this region .",
    "interestingly , the ysos in region 6 lie on the edge of the blow - out cavity .",
    "however , regions 4 and 5 are well beyond the radio ring and may represent a more quiescent form of star formation .",
    "in this section , we present seds of just two of the many interesting sources in the rcw  49 nebula .",
    "these are in region  2 of figure  [ regions ] , marked by arrows .",
    "the observed seds include data from 2mass , _ spitzer _ irac , and _",
    "msx_. the source indicated by the left arrow in region  2 is the brightest source in the region , and is mildly saturated at irac [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] bands . the source shown by the right arrow is a triangular - shaped greenish object .",
    "the seds of both sources are shown in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "irac photometry of the bright source was done by our automated pipeline .",
    "we did aperture photometry of the triangular source over a 4  aperture .",
    "the flux at @xmath31 m from these sources is blended at _ msx _",
    "resolution ( 18 ) , though likely dominated by the source at left .",
    "it is clear from the brightness of these sources that they are luminous and likely high - mass .",
    "we computed model seds for the ysos using the code of whitney et al .",
    "alvarez , hoara , & lucas ( 2004 ) modeled near - ir scattered light images of massive ysos using the same geometries we use to fit the seds in figure  [ sed ] : rotationally flattened infalling envelopes , disks , and dust - filled outflow cavities . the model that fits the bright source sed best",
    "is powered by a b2 main sequence star , has an envelope with an infall rate of @xmath32 m@xmath24/yr and a disk radius of 500 au ; this gives an envelope extinction along the line - of - sight of a@xmath33 .",
    "the model that fits the triangular source is powered by a b2.5 star , has an infall rate of @xmath34 m@xmath24/yr , disk radius of 100 au , and envelope extinction of 200 along the line - of - sight .",
    "both models are viewed at an inclination of @xmath35(where pole - on is defined as @xmath36 ) , and have foreground extinctions of a@xmath3715 .",
    "the seds could probably be fit with other envelope structures as long as a substantial amount of dust resides close to the star , and therefore the stars are sufficiently young that very little dust clearing has occured .",
    "the large number of infrared excess sources in rcw  49 indicates that star formation is ongoing in this giant region .",
    "we find that at least 300 stars brighter than 13@xmath38 magnitude in the [ 3.6 ] band are pre - main sequence or young stars of mass @xmath39  m@xmath5 . based on integration of a standard imf ,",
    "we conclude that the ysos in the rcw  49 complex comprise a stellar mass of @xmath274500  m@xmath5 .",
    "if the ysos represent a second generation of star formation , this suggests that the mass of the second generation is about 15% of the first .",
    "the presence of ysos of b spectral type does indeed suggest that some star formation is very recent . whether it is continuous or triggered by the w2 cluster",
    "is uncertain . the apparent excess of star formation near the radio / ir ring ( figure  [ 3col ] ) and several of the sites of star formation near the ring and blowout region perimeters ( regions 2,3 , and 6 in figure  [ regions ] ) suggest that energy input from w2 may have triggered recent star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "regions  4 and 5 appear to be forming stars in a relatively quiescent region of the cloud .",
    "the detailed nature of the star formation in rcw  49whether triggered or continuous , clustered or distributed , and the spatial distribution of mass  requires further study by the wider astronomical community .",
    "the images of this field have been released with the opening of the public archive ; the glimpse catalog and mosaic images will be available to the community from the _ spitzer _ science center in the fall of 2004 .",
    "we are grateful to stephan jansen for his invaluable work maintaining the glimpse computing network .",
