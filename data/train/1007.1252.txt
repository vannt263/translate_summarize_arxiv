    "given that wolf 940 a shows the line in absorption with a very typical strength for its type , we assume that it is no longer active and is therefore older than 3 gyr , which is the lower limit on the activity lifetime for an m4 dwarf ( west et al .",
    "2008 , their figure 10 ) .",
    "again we take a more conservative approach than b09 , and do not assume that the presence of h@xmath17 absorption implies that the star is still somewhat active , and so we do not put an upper limit on the age of the system based on chromospheric activity arguments .    in summary ,",
    "the kinematic and h@xmath17 properties of wolf 940 a imply that the system is between 3 and 10 gyr old .",

    "we obtained @xmath1 irs spectra of wolf 940 b via the director s discretionary time program 527 .",
    "the short - low module was used in first order which provides a spectrum covering the 7.5  14.5 @xmath0 m range , with a resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "a nearby star was used in the blue peak - up array to acquire the target in the 3@xmath327 slit .",
    "standard staring mode was used with a ramp duration of 60s and 84 cycles , for an observation of duration 3.6 hours ; two such observations were obtained .",
    "each cycle places the target at two slit positions , about one - third and two - thirds of the way along the slit . thus the total on - source exposure was 5.6 hours .",
    "both observations were carried out on the 16th december 2008 .",
    "we used the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) produced by the @xmath1 pipeline version s18.7.0 .",
    "this produces a two - dimensional long - slit spectrum at each of the nod positions , so for each of our two observations there are 84 files for each nod position .",
    "the bcd files have been processed by the pipeline , which includes ramp fitting , dark subtraction , droop correction , linearity correction , flat fielding , and wavelength calibration ( see section 5.1 of the irs instrument handbook ) .",
    "we treated the two observations as independent datasets .",
    "we used the iraf data reduction tool ( tody 1993 ) to subtract each nod pair , and combined the 84 subtracted images using sigma - clipping in the imcombine routine .",
    "some structure remained in the background of the combined images ; we removed this by subtracting a smoothed version of the image , using an @xmath33 box .",
    "this residual - structure subtracted image was then fed into the @xmath1 irs data reduction package spice .",
    "the source signal was low , and there were a large number of bad and hot pixels .",
    "spice takes as input : the image file , a bad pixel mask and an uncertainty image .",
    "we used the sigma image produced by the imcombine routine as the uncertainty mask , and a bad pixel mask included with the bcd files .",
    "spice traces the appropriate module s slit profile over the input image , allowing the user to set the location and the width of the extraction window .",
    "we extracted the positive and negative spectrum using a relatively small window of 2 pixels in order to avoid adding noise . the final step in the spice application converts the signal to a flux density .",
    "we combined the two negative and two positive extracted spectra manually .",
    "the signal to noise is quite low ( s / n @xmath3410 ) , and we visually identified bad data points by comparison of the four spectra .",
    "figure 1 shows the final spectrum , with the noise spectrum which is based on the deviation between the four individual spectra .",
    "we checked the flux calibration by synthesizing the irac [ 8.0 ] photometry from the spectrum , after extending it to the short end of the filter bandpass ( @xmath35 m ) using as a template the irs second order spectrum of a bright t8 dwarf ( this extension contributed 17% of the total flux through the filter ) .",
    "this check indicated that the flux calibration is good to 5% .",
    "our analysis is based on a method we developed that uses synthetic spectra to determine a bolometric correction that is consistent with the luminosity obtained from evolution models . because the effective temperatures and gravities obtained in this fashion are obtained from the _ integrated _ observed flux and not by fitting the observed spectrum , it is quite robust and is not sensitive to the known ( and unknown ) systematic biases that arise when fitting model spectra to the observed spectrum .",
    "the solution for the @xmath36 and gravity is further refined by direct comparison of the corresponding synthetic spectra with the spectroscopic and photometric data , as well as age constraints . in this section ,",
    "we first obtain @xmath36 and the gravity using solar metallicity models .",
    "the mid - infrared photometry and spectrum allow an exploration of non - equilibrium chemistry driven by vertical transport and we estimate the mixing time scale .",
    "finally , we perform the analysis again with non - solar metallicity models and by considering the uncertainty in @xmath37 .      our analysis of wolf 940 b is based on the atmospheric models and non - equilibrium chemistry scheme described in saumon et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) and the evolution sequences of saumon & marley ( 2008 ) .",
    "we use cloudless atmospheres and evolution as appropriate for a late t dwarf , and initially assume solar metallicity . the observed 1.05  2.43  @xmath0 m spectrum ( b09 ) and 7.5  14.2  @xmath0 m spectrum ( this work )",
    "are integrated to give an observed flux at earth of @xmath38 erg@xmath39s@xmath40cm@xmath16 .",
    "the irs spectrum contributes 39% of this value . following the method described in geballe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and saumon et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) , we derive a family of @xmath42 values that provide @xmath37 values that are consistent with the bolometric correction from the model spectra and the evolution .",
    "that is , the @xmath42 of the spectral model used to calculate the correction from observed to total flux , must be consistent with the @xmath42 implied by the evolutionary models for that total luminosity .",
    "these @xmath42 solutions are shown in figure 2 and table 2 , and correspond approximately to a constant @xmath37 curve in the @xmath42 plane .",
    "the bolometric correction amounts to @xmath43% of the luminosity , and the derived luminosity is @xmath44 ( for @xmath45k , see below and table 2 ) . combining the uncertainty in the flux calibration of the spectrum ( using a monte carlo sampling of a gaussian distribution of the calibration uncertainty for each segment of the spectrum ) and in the distance , the uncertainty in @xmath37 is @xmath46dex .",
    "figure 2 shows evolutionary sequences in a @xmath3 against @xmath47 plot ; the allowed set of values for wolf 940 b obtained with the method outlined above is indicated by the sequence of solid dots .",
    "the @xmath36 is thus constrained to be in the range of 500 to 640@xmath39k .",
    "this range can be narrowed from a knowledge of the age of the system , or by comparison of the data to model spectra .",
    "the @xmath42 of the models used to generate the synthetic spectra for such a data comparison must fall between the dashed red lines of figure 2 , which corresponds to @xmath48 .",
    "figure 2 also demonstrates how each ( @xmath3 , @xmath49 ) pair determines the dwarf s mass and age .",
    "table 2 gives the set of allowed parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , mass , radius and age ) in steps of @xmath51k for ages ranging from 0.4 to 10 gyr and for solar metallicity .",
    "the impact of varying metallicity is discussed below in  4.6 .",
    "having constrained the allowed @xmath42 parameter range , we compare the corresponding synthetic spectra with the data . figure 3 shows such a comparison for the solutions with ages of 1 , 5.5 and 10 gyr , i.e. the @xmath52 , @xmath53 solutions ( 575 , 4.722 ) , ( 600 , 4.989 ) and ( 625 , 5.221 ) ( see table 2 ) .",
    "note that the scaling of the model fluxes to the data is not adjustable : it is fixed by the measured distance to the wolf 940 system and the radius given in table 2 , determined by evolutionary models from the values of ( @xmath3 , @xmath54 ) . here",
    "we have assumed solar metallicity and an eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath55@xmath13s@xmath14 .",
    "the eddy diffusion coefficient parameterizes the time scale of vertical mixing in the upper radiative region of the atmosphere , that drives the chemistry of carbon and nitrogen out of equilibrium ( saumon et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; hubeny & burrows 2007 ) . in this analysis",
    ", we have considered @xmath56 ( chemical equilibrium ) , @xmath57 , @xmath11 and @xmath12@xmath13s@xmath14 .",
    "t dwarfs typically have values of @xmath10 between @xmath11 and @xmath12@xmath13s@xmath14 ( e.g. saumon et al .",
    "2007 , leggett et al .",
    "2009 , stephens et al .",
    "2009 ) ; the effect of varying @xmath10 is discussed further below . in the deeper convection zone ,",
    "the mixing time scale is determined from the mixing length formulation of convection .    as shown by figure 3 , and as we have found for other late t dwarfs , the near - infrared spectra of models constrained with our method are very nearly identical ( saumon et al . 2007 , geballe et al . 2009 ) .",
    "since these models have very nearly the same @xmath37 , it is a fairly accurate statement that the near infrared spectra of low@xmath58 models are independent of gravity _ at fixed _ @xmath37 , for a given metallicity .",
    "this is because the effect of increasing the gravity is partially canceled by the accompanying increase in effective temperature .",
    "also note that the effect of vertical mixing is not significant in the near - infrared at these @xmath3 ( e.g. saumon et al .",
    "2006 , and  4.4 below ) .",
    "the match to the near - infrared spectrum is poor , with the modelled @xmath59 and @xmath60 peaks high and the @xmath26 low ( figure 3 , top panel ) .",
    "this has been noticed before and is likely due to the known incompleteness of the molecular opacity line lists in this region ( e.g. saumon & marley 2008 ) .",
    "in contrast to the near - infrared region , differences are seen between the mid - infrared synthetic spectra generated by the approximately constant - luminosity models ( figure 3 , lower panel ) .",
    "calculation of the reduced @xmath61 between the models and the observed mid - infrared spectrum shows that the best match is the @xmath62k model ( @xmath63 ) , which is better than the 575@xmath39k ( @xmath64 ) and 625@xmath39k ( @xmath65 ) solutions .",
    "the @xmath66k solution is clearly excluded with @xmath67 .    vertical transport in the convection zone drives the chemistry of nitrogen away from equilibrium and results in a typical depletion of nh@xmath68 of a factor of 8  10 ( e.g. saumon et al .",
    "this increases the overall flux level in the 9 ",
    "15@xmath69 m region where absorption by nh@xmath68 dominates .",
    "a comparison of the observed spectrum and synthetic spectra computed with equilibrium chemistry gives large @xmath61 values  from 6.9 ( 550@xmath39k solution ) to 11.7 ( 625@xmath39k solution ) .",
    "those higher @xmath61 values arise from the inability of the equilibrium models to match the overall flux level of the irs spectrum for @xmath70 m ( saumon et al .",
    "2006 , see also further discussion below ) .",
    "we can conclude that there is convincing evidence for a depleted abundance of nh@xmath68 in the atmosphere of wolf 940 b , which is consistent with findings from all of the other irs spectra of late t dwarfs ( saumon et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2008 , leggett et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "synthetic fluxes in the @xmath71 and irac band passes were obtained by integrating the model spectra over the filter band passes , and these are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the irac [ 3.6 ] photometry is not well matched by any of the models .",
    "this is a known model deficiency ; leggett et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2010 ) show that the calculated [ 3.6 ] fluxes are systematically low by 20  50% .",
    "it is not clear if this is related to missing opacities in the near - infrared ( which may lead to too high near - infrared fluxes and too low mid - infrared fluxes ) , or if it is due to distortions of the pressure - temperature structure of our non - equilibrium models .",
    "the reduced @xmath61 between the synthetic and measured photometry in these five bands strongly favor the highest @xmath36 model at 625@xmath39k as well as a value of the eddy diffusion coefficient of @xmath72 . however , the @xmath61 is dominated by a large contribution from the irac [ 3.6 ] band pass ( figure 3 ) .",
    "if we ignore this flux measurement , then all three models with @xmath73k and @xmath74 match equally well and are far better than all other parameter combinations . for all four models from table 2 ,",
    "the spectrum computed in chemical equilibrium ( @xmath75 ) is by far the worst .",
    "thus , the photometry strongly favors models that depart from chemical equilibrium .    for a fixed metallicity ,",
    "the irac [ 4.5 ] flux is a sensitive probe of non - equilibrium carbon chemistry as the filter bandpass covers the fundamental band of co centered at 4.65@xmath69 m .",
    "more vigorous vertical transport ( i.e. larger @xmath10 ) leads to an over - abundance of co in the upper atmosphere and a strong band where none should be detectable at such low @xmath36 ( noll et al .",
    "1997 , golimowski et al .",
    "2004 , patten et al . 2006 , geballe et al .",
    "2009 ) . a low [ 4.5 ] flux is thus a hallmark of excess co and of a non - equilibrium co abundance .",
    "the observed [ 4.5 ] flux for wolf 940 b is well below what would be expected from chemical equilibrium and only non - equilibrium models can match its value .",
    "we find that @xmath76 gives an excellent match and figure 4 shows our best fitting non - equilibrium model spectrum , along with the corresponding equilibrium spectrum ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "a diffusion coefficient of @xmath77 @xmath13s@xmath14 corresponds to a vertical mixing time scale of @xmath78hours .",

    "15@xmath69 m region where absorption by nh@xmath68 dominates .",
    "finally , we note that fitting @xmath79 independently from @xmath36 , gravity and @xmath37 affects @xmath37 by less than 0.016 dex , which is small compared to the contributions from the distance and flux calibration uncertainties of 0.047 dex .      based on our solar metallicity model atmospheres , spectra and evolution",
    ", we conclude that wolf 940 b is best fitted with @xmath80k , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "if we apply the age constraint of 3  10@xmath39gyr determined by the primary , then the parameter range is further restricted to @xmath83k and @xmath84 .",

    "the values of @xmath36 and @xmath54 are correlated , thus wolf 940 b can not be both low-@xmath36 and high gravity .",
    "these ranges do not reflect the effect of the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath37 of 0.047 dex , which translates to @xmath85k in @xmath36 ( for a fixed gravity ) and @xmath86 dex in gravity ( for a fixed @xmath36 ) .      while we have been able to obtain a reasonably good fit of all the data available ( parallax , spectra and photometry ) , systematic differences between the models and the near - infrared spectrum linger .",
    "in particular , we find that the models are much bluer in @xmath87 than the data ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 band modelled flux is about half of what is observed .",
    "a blue @xmath87 color in a late t dwarf is an indicator of a high - gravity or low - metallicity object ( e.g. knapp et al .",
    "2004 ) . given all the constraints applied in our method of analysis",
    ", we can not change the gravity independently of @xmath36 ( except within the error bars ) and we have seen that this has no effect on the @xmath26 band flux ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we can , however , consider variations in metallicity and of the distance , within the range allowed by the parallax uncertainty .    we have redone the complete analysis by assuming that the luminosity is increased by @xmath88 to @xmath89 ( see figure 2 ) and keeping [ m / h]@xmath900 . for consistency",
    ", this new luminosity implies that the distance is increased by @xmath91 to 13.58@xmath39pc .",
    "this moves our best fitting model of @xmath62k and @xmath92 to @xmath93k and @xmath94 .",
    "this worsens the fit slightly , but well below the uncertainties and is thus not significant .",
    "the analysis was performed again with model atmospheres , spectra and evolution of different metallicities .",
    "we find that a variation of @xmath95=\\pm0.3 $ ] results in @xmath96 , which is half of the uncertainty on @xmath37 due to the photometric and parallax uncertainties .",
    "since the uncertainties in @xmath37 are effectively negligible in terms of spectrum fitting , for clarity of presentation we will make a comparison of spectra of different metallicity calculated with the best fitting @xmath97 we obtained in the solar metallicity case .",
    "spectra with [ m / h]@xmath98 and @xmath99 are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath79 depends on [ m / h ] . to better show the role of [ m / h ] in shaping the spectrum , we keep @xmath79 fixed at @xmath100@xmath13s@xmath14 for the non - solar metallicity models . as expected , increasing the metallicity raises the modelled @xmath26 band flux and a very good agreement",
    "is obtained for [ m / h]@xmath101 , but this comes at the cost of a significant increase in the modelled flux in the @xmath102 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 bands . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum with [ m / h]@xmath98 is an excellent match to the observed @xmath103 peaks but increases the discrepancy at @xmath26 .",
    "calculation of the reduced @xmath61 confirms the qualitative visual impression from the top panel of figure 5 that the [ m / h]@xmath98 spectrum is a better fit to the near infrared spectrum of wolf 940 b. the lower panel shows the opposite situation at mid - infrared wavelengths : the fit of the spectrum improves steadily as the metallicity increases from @xmath104 to @xmath99 .",
    "the mid - infrared photometry also favors higher metallicity if we neglect the poorly fit 3  4  @xmath0 m region ( where there is little flux ) . hence varying the metallicity from [ m / h]@xmath98 to + 0.3 has a seesaw effect on the shape of the spectrum compared to the data and provides no real improvement over the solar metallicity fit . since the extremes of that range lead to notably poor fits in the near - infrared or the mid - infrared",
    ", we can reasonably conclude that wolf 940 b has a metallicity within @xmath40.2 dex of solar , which is consistent with the value of [ m / h]@xmath7 derived for the primary star using the johnson & apps ( 2008 ) @xmath8:@xmath9 relationship ( see  2 ) .",
    "figure 5 ( lower panel ) shows that the [ 4.5 ] flux is not only sensitive to @xmath79 , it is also sensitive to [ m / h ] .",
    "the best solar metallicity solution gives @xmath105 using this datapoint , as described above in  4.4 . if [ m / h]@xmath106 then @xmath107 reproduces the observed [ 4.5 ] flux , and similarly if [ m / h]@xmath98 then @xmath108 .",
    "values of @xmath109 4 , 6 and 7 correspond to mixing time scales of 2.8 days , 1.6 hours and 14 minutes respectively .",
    "the convective mixing time scale is 0.6 min for comparison , meaning that @xmath108 implies that mixing is almost as vigorous as convection which may not be realistic .",
    "a metallicity as low as [ m / h]@xmath98 appears unlikely based on the very high value of @xmath79 required , again consistent with the solar or slightly metal - rich solution found for the primary .",
    "we have presented a 7.5  14.2  @xmath0 m low - resolution spectrum of the t8.5 dwarf wolf 940 b , which is a companion to an m4 dwarf with a projected separation of 400 au .",
    "this spectrum complements the near - infrared spectrum and @xmath21 photometry presented by b09 , and the irac photometry presented by leggett et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . combining all these data",
    "allows a rigorous analysis of the dwarf s sed . assuming an age range of 3  10 gyr as indicated by the primary , evolutionary and atmospheric models",
    "show that for the t dwarf secondary @xmath83k and @xmath84 .",
    "gravity and temperature are correlated such that the lower gravity corresponds to the lower @xmath36 and younger age for the system , and the higher value to the higher @xmath36 and older age .",
    "the mass of the t dwarf is 24 m@xmath18 to 45 m@xmath18 for the younger to older age limits .",
    "an age younger than 1 gyr is excluded by the analysis of the t dwarf spectrum alone .",
    "these temperatures and gravities are slightly higher than those derived in b09 .",
    "our luminosity , which benefits from the inclusion of the irs spectrum , is slightly ( but not significantly ) higher than determined by b09 .",
    "our higher temperature and gravity range principally arises from our more conservative approach to the age of the primary , for which we adopt 3  10 gyr as opposed to b09 s 3  5 gyr .",
    "the irs spectrum demonstrates that vertical mixing is important in the radiative zone of the atmosphere of wolf 940 b , as is the case for many , if not all , t dwarfs .",
    "the [ 4.5 ] photometric datapoint constrains @xmath110 to 5.5 for solar metallicity .",
    "if the metallicity is higher then @xmath10 is lower , and vice versa .",
    "comparison of the synthetic sed to the observational data shows that wolf 940 b has a metallicity within @xmath40.2 dex of solar .",
    "more extreme values give poor fits to the data  lower metallicity produces a poor fit at @xmath5 m while higher metallicity produces a poor fit at @xmath6 m .",
    "this is consistent with the value of [ m / h]@xmath7 derived here for the primary star using the johnson & apps ( 2008 ) @xmath8:@xmath9 relationship .",
    "it is very useful to find t dwarf companions to main sequence stars , given that the brown dwarfs are cooling and hence mass is difficult to constrain without knowing age .",
    "we look forward to more examples like wolf 940 b ( b09 ) and ross 458 c ( goldman et al . 2010 ) being found , as the ukidss sky area increases .",
