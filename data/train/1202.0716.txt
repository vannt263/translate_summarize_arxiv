    "the topological origin of global phase factors resulting from cyclic local @xmath1 evolutions of entangled pairs of qubits was first noted by milman and mosseri @xcite .",

    "this topological phase for two qubits has since then been experimentally observed in the context of polarization and spatial mode transformations of a laser beam @xcite , and in the context of nmr @xcite .",
    "more recently , oxman and khoury @xcite showed that topological phases are a feature of two - qudit systems , for arbitrary dimension @xmath4 , and gave an explicit description of the topological structure of the local @xmath5 orbits .",
    "the topological nature of the phase factors is related to entanglement in the sense that they are only present in two - qubit systems with nonzero concurrence , or more generally , nonzero determinant of the coefficient matrix @xcite for qudit pairs .",
    "characterizing multipartite entanglement is a challenging problem due to the rich structure of entanglement classes .",
    "different approaches include the classification of orbits in terms of their stabilizer groups @xcite , parametrization of orbit spaces by non - local parameters @xcite , inter - convertibility under local operations @xcite , and the study of entanglement invariants @xcite .",
    "the coarsest characterization of entanglement properties is equivalence under stochastic local operations and classical communication , slocc , i.e. , inter - convertibility of quantum states under the widest possible group of local invertible operations .",

    "a [ udnurt]quantum system , initially in pure state @xmath7 , undergoing evolution through a continuous closed path in its projective hilbert space by action of a lie - group @xmath8 , acquires a global phase factor @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "we allow @xmath11 to be a complex number to include the most general case of dissipative evolution and refer to it , in this case , as a complex phase .",
    "the phase factor is determined by the @xmath8-action and the state .",
    "let us now consider the case where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are such that only a discrete set of phase factors are possible as the result of closed path evolution . then",
    "two closed paths associated with different phase factors can not be continuously deformed into each other since this would require the phase factor to change continuously through the forbidden intermediate values .",
    "two such closed paths hence belong to different homotopy classes with @xmath7 as the base point , on the @xmath8-orbit over @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8-orbit over @xmath7 is the immersed submanifold @xmath12 of projective hilbert space .",
    "the discreteness of the set of possible phase factors thus implies that the topology of @xmath13 is non - trivial in the sense that it is not simply connected .",
    "we therefore denote the phases associated with closed path evolutions of these kind of states as _",
    "topological phases_.    the set of phase factors @xmath9 associated with cyclic @xmath8-evolutions of a state @xmath7 are the solutions of the equations of the form    @xmath14    the phase factors @xmath9 and the associated cyclic evolutions are closely related to stabilizers of the state @xmath7 in the sense that if @xmath15 is a group element giving the topological phase @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the set of all such elements , then the union of all such sets @xmath18 is the stabilizer subgroup of @xmath8 of the state @xmath7 , viewed as an element of projective hilbert space .",
    "likewise the set @xmath19 , is the stabilizer subgroup of @xmath20 of the state @xmath7 , when viewed as an element of hilbert space .",
    "the set of @xmath21 for each @xmath11 can be a discrete set of group elements , or a discrete set of continuous families @xmath22 parametrized by real parameters @xmath23 . for each family @xmath22 ,",

    "each such class , when acting on @xmath7 , defines a homotopy class of cyclic evolutions with @xmath7 as base point , in @xmath13 , corresponding to the phase @xmath11 .",
    "we can therefore use the families @xmath22 to represent the corresponding homotopy classes .",
    "furthermore , the phase factor associated with the class of contractible loops is by necessity @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the choice of base point for the closed paths in @xmath13 does not alter the set of available topological phases .",

    "the restriction to local special unitary operations , rather than the full group of local unitary operations , is made since the set of phase factors that results from cyclic @xmath29 evolution is always continuous , and would therefore not reveal any information about the topology of @xmath30 .    to elucidate the question of appearance of topological phases in @xmath2-qubit systems",
    "we make the following observation . a criterion for existence of topological phases , satisfied for a wide class of states",

    "let us consider the states that can be brought to a form where every reduced one - qubit density matrix is maximally mixed by a sequence ( possibly infinite ) of @xmath31-operations .",
    "such states belong to a class for which there exist a nonzero polynomial in the expansion coefficients of the state , when represented in a local basis , that is invariant under @xmath31-operations @xcite .",
    "the existence of such an invariant puts a restriction on the set of phases @xmath11 that can result from cyclic evolutions , since a polynomial of degree @xmath4 in the expansion coefficients can only be invariant under multiplication by phase factors @xmath9 satisfying @xmath32 .",

    "the property of a state of being related to a state with maximally mixed reduced one - qubit density matrices by a sequence ( possibly infinite ) of @xmath31-operations means that the state is @xmath31-semistable @xcite .",
    "a state @xmath33 is @xmath31-semistable if the @xmath34-vector is not included in the closure @xmath35 of the @xmath31-orbit .",
    "in other words , the norm of @xmath33 can not approach zero asymptotically under action of @xmath31 .",
    "it is this property that implies that @xmath33 can be separated from 0 by some @xmath31 polynomial invariant @xmath36 , that is @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "states that are not semistable are termed @xmath31-unstable .",
    "the relation between topological phases , entanglement properties , and polynomial invariants is discussed in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ ent ] .    from the above we",
    "can conclude that all @xmath31-semistable states have topological phases .",
    "furthermore , some of the @xmath31-unstable states also have topological phases . to illustrate the different cases we consider some examples of @xmath31-semistable and -unstable states . here and throughout the rest of the paper we will ignore the normalization of states .",
    "an example of an @xmath40-semistable three - qubit state is the ghz - state @xmath41 .",
    "the cyclic @xmath42 evolutions correspond to two different sets of families of stabilizers @xcite .",
    "one set , containing two families distinguished by integers @xmath43 , where each family is parametrized by real numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 , is    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the @xmath48 operation on the @xmath49th qubit .",

    "the four different families of these two sets correspond to four different homotopy classes ( of which one is trivial ) of cyclic evolutions on @xmath62 .",
    "the generalized @xmath2-qubit ghz - states @xmath63 have families of stabilizers parametrized by @xmath64 real parameters and integers @xmath65 .",
    "these are a direct generalization of the stabilizers of the three - qubit ghz - state , and read    @xmath66    where @xmath67 , @xmath43 , for which @xmath68 , and    @xmath69    where @xmath70 , @xmath54 , for odd @xmath2 and @xmath71 , @xmath54 , for even @xmath2 .",

    "( [ 66 ] ) are @xmath72 for odd number of qubits and @xmath68 for even number of qubits .",
    "another class of @xmath2-qubit states , that coincide with the ghz - state for three qubits , but where the topological phases have a different @xmath2-dependence , are the states of the form @xmath73 for which the stabilizers , parametrized by integers @xmath74 , are @xmath75\\pi\\sigma_{z}^{k}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the corresponding topological phases are @xmath76 .",
    "we next turn to the @xmath31-unstable states .",
    "these are the complement of the semistable states in hilbert space , and contain all the states that do not have topological phases .",
    "however , as previously mentioned , there are states in this category that do have topological phases .",
    "a general result concerning which properties of an @xmath31-unstable state that implies existence of topological phases is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "instead , we consider a few examples of @xmath31-unstable states to demonstrate that there are states in this category with topological phases for any number of qubits , as well as states without topological phases for any number of qubits .    for three qubits we can consider the @xmath77-state @xmath78 . in any basis",
    "this state can be expressed on the form    @xmath79 and @xmath80 are orthogonal states of the @xmath49th qubit . since qubits @xmath81 and @xmath82 are in a product state in the first term and in a maximally entangled state in the second term , these two terms can not be brought to each other by @xmath42 operations .",
    "therefore , in a cyclic evolution each of the two terms must evolve back into themselves . furthermore , focusing on the first qubit , the only @xmath1 operations for which both @xmath83 and @xmath84 are eigenvectors , are the diagonal operators @xmath85 .",
    "due to permutation symmetry we can conclude that each local @xmath1 operation has to be on the same form , up to an overall sign .",
    "it follows that the full group of stabilizers corresponding to cyclic evolutions of the @xmath77-state is    @xmath86    with @xmath44 an arbitrary real number and @xmath87 integers . from this",
    "we see that the global phase @xmath88 can take any value .",
    "the @xmath77-state is thus an example of an @xmath89-unstable state that does not have topological phases .",
    "the generalized @xmath2-qubit @xmath77-state @xmath90 , with stabilizers @xmath91 , does not have topological phases either .",
    "we can thus conclude that there will be entangled states without topological phases for arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "having seen this , let us now instead consider examples of @xmath92-unstable states with topological phases . for three qubits",
    ", we consider the state @xmath93 , that belong to the @xmath77 slocc - class @xcite . in any basis",
    ", this state can be expressed as @xmath94 where again @xmath95 and @xmath80 are orthogonal states of the @xmath49th qubit .",
    "also in this case the two terms must evolve into themselves under a cyclic @xmath42 evolution .",
    "the difference compared to the @xmath77-state is that , considering again the first qubit , the only @xmath1 operations , for which both @xmath96 and @xmath84 are eigenvectors , are @xmath97 . due to permutation symmetry it can be seen that the only cyclic evolutions of @xmath33 are the ones corresponding to the stabilizers @xmath98 , and that @xmath99 .",
    "thus , @xmath100 has topological phases .",
    "generalizing this construction to @xmath2-qubits we construct the states    @xmath101    the cyclic evolutions correspond to the stabilizers @xmath102 where @xmath103 , and @xmath68 for all @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we make a few observations about the stabilizers corresponding to cyclic evolutions associated with a topological phase @xmath11 .",
    "two stabilizer subgroups associated with two different states that belong to the same local unitary orbit are conjugated .",
    "more precisely , for a stabilizer @xmath104 of a state @xmath33 , there will be for every local unitary operator @xmath105 , a conjugated stabilizer @xmath106 of the state @xmath107 associated with the same topological phase .",
    "furthermore , the stabilizer @xmath104 is a stabilizer of all states related to @xmath33 by a local filtering operation @xmath108 ( a diagonalizable slocc - operation ) that diagonalize in the same basis as @xmath104 .",
    "the conjugated stabilizer @xmath106 is likewise a stabilizer of any state related to @xmath107 by the local filtering operation @xmath109 . a local unitary operation @xmath105 on @xmath33 followed by a local filtering operations in the basis for which @xmath106 diagonalize is equivalent to a local filtering operation in the basis for which @xmath104 diagonalize followed by a unitary operation @xmath105 since @xmath110 .",
    "from this we can conclude that all states related to @xmath33 by the set of slocc - operations on the form @xmath111 and their local unitary orbits all share the topological phase @xmath11 .",
    "this equivalence class of states with a common stabilizer , up to conjugation , associated with a topological phase @xmath11 is thus wider than a unitary equivale nce class but not a full slocc - class .",
    "we call this family of unitary orbits the _ @xmath112-class associated with @xmath104_. the @xmath112-equivalence constitute a classification of entanglement intermediate in coarseness between slocc - equivalence and local unitary equivalence .",
    "as already seen there is a relation between the topological phases of a state and its entanglement properties . we [ ent]now examine this relation in some more detail .    through examples",
    "we have established that for arbitrary number of qubits there is a hierarchy of states , where the @xmath31-semistable states constitute the smallest set , contained within the larger set of states with topological phases , being in turn a subset of the full hilbert space .",
    "all of these examples are states with @xmath2-partite entanglement , i.e. , states that are inseparable over any bipartition of the qubits .",
    "furthermore , no state where at least one qubit is in a tensor product with the rest of the qubits , can have a topological phase .",
    "this follows from the fact that a single qubit in a pure state can be given an arbitrary phase factor by closed path @xmath1 evolution .",
    "a state of the form @xmath113 has a topological phase @xmath11 if and only if @xmath114 and @xmath115 have topological phases @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "in such a case @xmath118 . the relation between the set of states with topological phases , the set of states with @xmath2-partite entanglement , and the set of @xmath31-semistable states",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig ] .",
    "any @xmath31-invariant polynomial is invariant only if the state is not normalized after an @xmath31-operation .",
    "if the resulting state is normalized , the polynomial instead becomes a homogenous function of the coefficients @xmath119 , that has its maximum on the set of states for which all reduced rank-@xmath81 density matrices are maximally mixed @xcite .",
    "therefore , arguing that these kind of homogenous functions are measures of entanglement , it was suggested that the states for which all reduced rank-@xmath81 density matrices are maximally mixed , should be viewed as the maximally entangled states within their respective slocc - orbit .",
    "the maximally entangled state of a slocc - orbit is unique up to local unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "thus , there is at most one local unitary orbit that is maximally entangled in each slocc - orbit .",
    "from the point of view of topological phases these maximally entangled states have a special significance in relation to the geometric phase @xcite .",
    "generally , the topological phase consists of a dynamical and a geometric phase . for the maximally",
    "entangled states , the dynamical phase is zero and thus the acquired topological phase @xmath11 is identical to the geometric phase .",
    "the geometric phase for a cyclic evolution of a maximally entangled state is therefore of topological origin .",
    "the @xmath31-unstable states that do have topological phases , but for which there are no nonzero @xmath31-invariants , can not be brought to a form with maximally mixed reduced rank-@xmath81 density matrices .",
    "therefore , there are no such states for which the acquired phase is purely geometric for all cyclic evolutions belonging to the same homotopy class .    as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] there is a relation between polynomial @xmath31-invariants and topological phases in the sense that knowledge of an invariant imposes restrictions on the possible values of topological phases , and vice versa , knowledge of a topological phase imposes a restriction on the form of polynomial invariants .",
    "now , let @xmath120 be the smallest possible topological phase that a specific state can attain as the result of cyclic evolution . for convenience we chose @xmath11 to be positive .",
    "the existence of an @xmath31-invariant polynomial of degree @xmath4 implies that the states in the corresponding slocc - class where the invariant is nonzero can only have @xmath120 that are multiples of @xmath121 .",
    "the value @xmath121 of @xmath120 is the smallest possible given the degree of the polynomial , but this value need not be realized by any cyclic evolution . if several @xmath31-invariant polynomials of degrees @xmath122 are nonzero for some slocc - class , this limits the possible values of @xmath120 for this class to be a multiple of @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath125 .",
    "vice versa , the existence of an @xmath31-semistable state such that @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is an integer , implies that there must be an @xmath31-invariant polynomial of even degree @xmath4 such that @xmath128 is an integer .",
    "the degree @xmath4 must be even since no nonzero @xmath31-invariant polynomial of odd d egree exist .",
    "the algebra of polynomial @xmath31-invariants is finitely generated , i.e. , there exist a finite number of polynomials that generate the algebra @xcite .",
    "since every monomial part of an invariant must contain at least one of the generators as a factor , it follows that for every state for which a polynomial invariant is nonzero , one of the generators must be nonzero as well .",
    "this means that the degree of the generating polynomials puts the ultimate limit on what topological phases can exist in a system of qubits .",
    "if the degree of the generators are @xmath129 this restricts the set of topological phases to be a subset of @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are integers .    for two qubits",
    "the well known @xmath3-phase @xcite is the only possible topological phase .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the only generator of the @xmath132-invariant polynomials for two qubits is the complex concurrence , or preconcurrence @xmath133 @xcite which is a polynomial of degree @xmath81 , related to the concurrence @xmath134 by @xmath135 .    for three qubits in addition to the @xmath3-phase",

    "in contrast , the states with topological phase @xmath136 in @xmath145 belong to subfamilies characterized by two complex numbers .",
    "furthermore , all states in @xmath145 have the topological phase @xmath3 .",
    "from this we can see that a randomly chosen state in @xmath145 will , with probability one , have only the topological phase @xmath3 .    going in the other direction we can say that the existence of a topological phase @xmath146 implies that there must be a generator polynomial of degree @xmath147 where @xmath148 is an integer .",
    "more precisely , if a state has a topological phase @xmath146 , the only polynomials that are nonzero on the @xmath27-orbit of the state are of degrees @xmath147 and at least one of those must be a generator .",

    "they can be viewed as non - polynomial entanglement invariants , that give a qualitative characterization of the entanglement properties of the state .",
    "having discussed the existence of topological phases , and their relation to entanglement properties , we now turn to the question of calculating the values of @xmath11 given a state and finding the full set of topological phases @xmath11 that can exist in an @xmath2-qubit system .    a way to approach the problem of finding the set of @xmath9 associated with closed paths on an @xmath27-orbit of a state @xmath7 is to consider eq .",

    "each row , containing only @xmath26 s and @xmath163 s , is in turn uniquely determined by a specification of which elements are @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath226 .",

    "the characterization in terms of equivalence classes of states with the same topological phase , is intermediate in coarseness between slocc - equivalence and local unitary equivalence .",
    "we have discussed the relationship between topological phases and entanglement properties , in particular the relation to nonzero slocc - invariant polynomials .",
    "it was found that for up to four qubits there is a direct correspondence between the topological phase factors and the degree of the generating polynomials of the algebra of polynomial slocc - invariants .",
    "we have shown that all @xmath31-semistable @xmath2-qubit states have topological phases and thus that their @xmath27-orbits are not simply connected .",
    "we have demonstrated that there are states with topological phases in the class of @xmath31-unstable states for any number of qubits .",
    "we have described a method for finding the topological phases for an arbitrary number of qubits and used this method to find the full set of topological phases for up to seven qubits .",
    "while the @xmath291-orbit of an entangled qubit pair is doubly connected , for higher number of qubits the presence of phases that are smaller fractions of @xmath3 implies that the corresponding orbits are multiply connected , i.e , have highly non - trivial topology .",
    "the results show that the number of different topological phases grows rapidly with the number of qubits .",
    "several open questions remain .",
    "\\(1 ) the relationship between topological phases and the degree of the generating polynomials is unclear .",
    "a particular question is if it is true , for an @xmath2-qubit system , that every state with @xmath260 such that it is not a multiple of any other minimal topological phase , is in a slocc - class for which a generator of degree @xmath4 is nonzero .",
    "if true , these topological phases could be used to predict the degree of some of the generating polynomials .",
    "\\(2 ) the question of the relation between @xmath27-invariant polynomials and topological phases has only been touched upon .",
    "in particular , the question regarding the correspondence between topological phases and the degree of the generating polynomials is pertinent .",
    "\\(3 ) in the case of two , three , and four qubits a randomly selected state has unit probability to have only the topological phase @xmath3 .",
    "thus , states with topological phases other than @xmath3 is a set of zero measure .",
    "it is unknown whether this is a general behavior for larger number of qubits .",
    "\\(4 ) no general criteria regarding existence of topological phases in @xmath31-unstable states have been found .",
    "the existence of nonzero @xmath27-invariant polynomials for this category of states would imply the existence of topological phases .",
    "the question is thus if such invariants exist and if their existence is related to a criterion similar to that of semistability .",
    "finally , a natural extension of this work would be to consider cyclic evolutions in the full @xmath31 group .",
    "besides allowing @xmath11 to be a complex phase , it would extend the set of cyclic evolutions to those corresponding to non - diagonalizable stabilizers , which can not be analyzed by the method used in this paper .",
    "these cyclic evolutions would give a set of topological phases related to the topological structure of the given @xmath31-orbit . while all @xmath31-semistable orbits have such topological phases , it is unclear to us if there exist @xmath31-unstable orbits with topological phases .",
    "for the @xmath31-semistable states only real - valued @xmath11 can exist , since no polynomial in the expansion coefficients of the state is invariant under multiplication by a complex number with absolute value different from unity .",
    "this is directly related to the fact that all cyclic @xmath31-evolutions are norm - preserving for this class of states . for",
    "less than five qubits these norm - preserving cyclic evolutions would not yield any additional topological phases to those given in table [ table ] , since the degree of the generating @xmath31-invariant polynomials forbids it . for five or more qubits additional phases for @xmath31 evolutions",
    "could be a possibility .",

    "see supplemental material at [ url will be inserted by publisher ] for a complete list of multisets associated to irreducible @xmath190-states of maximal length and the corresponding topological phases for three to seven qubits .",
    "the problem of finding topological phases for an @xmath2-qubit system has been reduced to the problem of finding multisets of integers @xmath228 with greatest common divisor 1 such that there exist at least @xmath2 equal sum proper submultisets , and such that integers are uniquely defined by their memberships in these submultisets .",
    "in addition to this the multisets are required to satisfy that @xmath236 . here",
    "we present a complete list of all such multisets of positive integers that correspond to irreducible @xmath190-states of maximal length for @xmath297 .",
    "the two - qubit is not included since there are no irreducible @xmath190-states of maximal length for two - qubits .    from these multisets the corresponding topological phases and @xmath112-classes can be constructed .",
    "given a multiset @xmath228 where the @xmath2 equal sum submultisets each have the sum @xmath298 , the minimal topological phase @xmath120 is uniquely determined by the sum @xmath299 and @xmath298 as @xmath300 .",
    "as we are only interested in @xmath190-states where we require the @xmath177 s are all positive , we must add the condition that @xmath301 , since otherwise @xmath224 is negative .    for many multisets",
    "there is more then one way to choose @xmath2 equal sum submultisets with a given sum @xmath298 such that the integers are still uniquely defined by their memberships in these submultisets .",
    "each way of choosing the @xmath2 submultisets correspond to an @xmath112-class of states up to permutations of the qubits .",
    "therefore , for a given multiset and a given @xmath298 there can be many @xmath112-classes .",
    "because of this , we do not present a list of all @xmath112-classes but instead list only the multisets and @xmath298 together with the corresponding @xmath120 .    to find the @xmath112-classes corresponding to a specific multiset @xmath228 and @xmath298 , one can identify the different choices of submultisets .",
    "these submultisets can then be used to construct the rows of the following equation        as an example we can consider the multiset @xmath302 for which there is ten proper submultisets with sum @xmath140 .",
    "these are @xmath303 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , and @xmath305 . from these submultisets",
    "we need to choose seven corresponding to a choice of rows in eq .",
    "( [ col ] ) . however , not any selection of seven out of these submultisets will be such that the integers are uniquely defined by their memberships in the submultisets . to see this let us temporarily obscure the identities of the integers and denote them as @xmath306 and the submultisets as @xmath307 , @xmath308 , @xmath308 , @xmath308 , @xmath308 , @xmath308 , @xmath308 , @xmath308 , @xmath308 , and @xmath309 we then see that @xmath307 and @xmath309 need to be included in the selection since @xmath310 is the only equation that defines the integer @xmath112 , and the equation @xmath311 does not uniquely define @xmath312 or @xmath134 unless in conjunction with @xmath313 .",
    "given that we have found a selection of submultisets that uniquely defines the integers we can create the corresponding matrix .",
    "for example , a choice corresponding to @xmath303 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , @xmath304 , and @xmath305 is      identifying the columns of the matrix on the left - hand side , and the column vector on the right - hand side with the weight - vectors of the state we can easily write down a representative of the @xmath112-class as      the multisets for three , four , five , and six qubits are given in table .",
