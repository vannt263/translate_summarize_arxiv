    "neutron stars contain matter in one of the densest forms found in the universe .",
    "their central density ranges from a few time the density of normal nuclear matter to about one order of magnitude higher , depending on the star s mass and the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "neutron stars therefore provide us with a powerful tool for exploring the properties of such dense matter . in the last decades ,",
    "this tool was applied to , among other topics , the determination of the eos of dense , charge neutral , @xmath3-equilibrated matter by means of comparing the theoretical predicted properties with observations of neutron stars .",
    "this was attempted by studying , for example , the maximum stable star mass @xcite , the minimum rotation period @xcite , or the thermal behaviour ( tsuruta 1966 , schaab et al .",
    "1996 , page 1997 ; see balberg , lichtenstadt & cook 1998 for a recent review ) .    recently , strohmayer et al .",
    "and van der klis et al .",
    "discovered with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray brightness of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs , see van der klis 1997 for a recent review ) . in subsequent observations ,",
    "three qpos were often detected simultaneously in a given source .",
    "the frequency separation between both qpos is almost constant , although the frequencies of the two qpos themselves vary by several hundred hertz . up to now",
    ", the only exceptions are the atoll sources 4u1608 - 52 and 4u1735 - 44 and the z - source scorpius x-1 in which the frequency separation varies with the luminosity by roughly @xmath4% @xcite .",
    "psaltis et al . found that the qpo data of the other lmxbs are consistent both with being constant and with varying by a similar fraction as in the two sources quoted before .",
    "the frequency of oscillations during type i x - ray bursts detected in some sources are consistent with the frequency separation of the two qpos or with its first overtone . only in the source 4u1636 - 536",
    "the averaged frequency separation , @xmath5  hz , and the half of the frequency in type i bursts , @xmath6  hz , differ by approximately 15% @xcite . in the power spectrum of bursts of",
    "the same source miller found a second signal at 290  hz  @xmath7 .",
    "these observations strongly favour the beat frequency model where the frequency separation between the two qpos originates from the stellar spin , whereas the higher qpo is produced by accreting gas in a stable , nearly circular orbit around the neutron star .",
    "though , it has to be clarified how the slightly varying frequency separation and the small deviation of the frequency separation from the burst frequency can be incorporated into this model .    beside the two kilohertz qpos and the burst oscillations ,",
    "also qpos with frequencies of a few tens of hertz were detected in some sources .",
    "their frequencies correlate with the high frequency kilohertz qpos .",
    "these low frequency qpos were interpreted by stella & vietri to originate from the lense - thirring precession of the accreting disc due to the frame dragging effect of the rapidly spinning neutron star @xcite .    both , the identification of the high frequency kilohertz qpos with the orbital frequency of a stable circular orbit and the low frequency qpos with the frame dragging frequency of the same orbit allow to constrain the mass of the neutron star and also the eos of neutron star matter @xcite . if the evidence for the detection of qpos of the innermost stable circular orbit in the sources 4u1608 - 52 , 4u1636 - 536 @xcite , and 4u1820 - 30 @xcite can be confirmed by future observations , the constraints are rather severe , allowing only a few stiff eoss .",
    "the frequency separation of the two kilohertz qpos show that the neutron star in lmxbs are rapidly rotating with periods ranging from 2.5  ms to 4  ms .",
    "it can therefore be expected that the geometry of the neutron star and its exterior space time is non - spherical .",
    "since the innermost stable orbit is located at only a few kilometres above the star s surface , the deviation from the kerr space time are large and should not be neglected . in order to compare theoretical neutron star models with qpo observations ,",
    "a completely general relativistic calculation of the rotating neutron star structure and space time geometry is therefore necessary .    in order to study the impact and the discrimination power of the qpo data in greater detail , we select a broad collection of modern eoss , which were obtained utilising numerous assumptions about the dynamics and composition of super dense matter . to mention several ,",
    "these are : the many - body technique used to determine the eos ; the model for the nucleon - nucleon interaction ; description of electrically charge neutral neutron star matter in terms of either only neutrons and protons in generalised chemical equilibrium ( @xmath3 equilibrium ) with electrons and muons , or nucleons , hyperons and more massive baryon states in @xmath3 equilibrium with leptons ; hyperon coupling strengths in matter ; inclusion of meson ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) condensation ; treatment of the transition of confined hadronic matter into quark matter ; and assumptions about the true ground state of strongly interacting matter ( i.e. , absolute stability of strange quark matter relative to baryon matter ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : equations ] we summarise the equations which govern the space time structure and compare the approximate values of the orbital frequencies , the radius of the innermost stable orbit , and the lense - thirring precession frequencies with the respective values from the exact numerical solution of einstein s equations . the physics of the eoss is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : eos ] .",
    "the high frequency kilohertz qpos and their interpretation in combination with their compatibility with the different eoss are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : constr1 ] .",
    "the implications of the identification of the low frequency qpos with lense - thirring precession are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : constr2 ] .",
    "we summarise our results , the constraints to the neutron star masses , and the conclusions concerning the neutron star eos in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the stationary , axis - symmetric , and asymptotic flat metric in quasi isotropic coordinates reads @xmath10 where the metric coefficients @xmath11 are functions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 only .",
    "the metric coefficients are determined by the einstein equation ( @xmath14 ) @xmath15 and the energy - momentum conservation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stress - energy tensor of an ideal fluid with the 4-velocity @xmath18 the energy density @xmath19 , and the pressure @xmath20 .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , hence @xmath23 @xmath24 is the angular velocity of the fluid with respect to an observer at infinity .",
    "the proper velocity @xmath25 of the fluid with respect to the local eulerian observer @xmath26 @xcite is given by the equation @xmath27 note that if the fluid were at rest with respect to the observer @xmath26 , @xmath28 , it would not necessarily be at rest for an inertial observer at infinity , since @xmath29 .",
    "this phenomena of _ dragging of the inertial frame _ was first studied by lense & thirring and turns out to be important for the investigation of the lense - thirring precession of the accreting disc ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : constr2 ] ) .",
    "the four non - trivial einstein equations together with the energy - momentum conservation are solved via a finite difference scheme @xcite .",
    "we follow bonazzola et al . in compactifying the outer space to a finite region by using the transformation @xmath30 .",
    "the boundary condition of approximate flatness can then be exactly fulfilled .",
    "the neutron star model is uniquely determined by fixing one of the parameters : central density , gravitational mass , baryon number , kepler orbiting frequency at the star s equator or at the marginally stable radius , as well as one of the parameters : angular velocity , angular momentum , or stability parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the models of maximum mass and/or maximum rotation velocity can also be calculated .",
    "since @xmath32 and @xmath33 are killing vectors , the components @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the 4-momentum of a freely falling particle are constants of motion and can be identified with the negative of the specific energy @xmath36 ( in units of the rest mass @xmath37 ) and the specific angular momentum @xmath38 , respectively . for a particle motion confined to the equatorial plane the geodesic equation @xmath39 yields : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the effective potential for the particle motion @xcite . a circular orbit , @xmath42 , is given by the expression for the 4-velocity of the fluid inside the star .",
    "then , the specific energy @xmath36 and angular momentum @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of the lorentz factor @xmath21 ( eq . [ eq : gamma ] ) and the proper velocity @xmath25 ( eq . [ eq : proper.vel ] ) : @xmath43 the circular orbit exists if @xmath44 , thus represents the partial differential @xmath45 . ]",
    "@xmath46 the proper velocity @xmath25 of a particle corotating with the star is given by @xmath47 the circular orbit is stable , if @xmath48 with ( see also cook , shapiro & teukolksky 1992 and datta , thampan & bombacci 1998 ) @xmath49 the zero of @xmath50 determines the radius @xmath51 of the innermost stable or marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "the kepler frequency @xmath52 of a circular orbit as measured by a distant observer is given by the proper velocity @xmath25 through the expression @xmath53 and the lense - thirring precession frequency by @xmath54 the respective values at the innermost stable orbit with radius @xmath51 are denoted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the circumferential radius @xmath57 of the object is linked to the equatorial coordinate radius @xmath12 by the expression @xmath58      though we shall use the exact expressions for @xmath52 , @xmath59 , @xmath55 , and @xmath60 in our investigation , we give also , for the purpose of comparison , the approximate expressions valid to first order of the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denotes the angular momentum and gravitational mass , respectively .",
    "the approximate expressions have the advantage to constrain the mass and the angular momentum independently of the eos .",
    "to first order in @xmath64 the corresponding expression are @xcite : @xmath65",
    "the eos of neutron star matter is the basic input quantity to the structure equations discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : equations ] .",
    "its knowledge over a wide range of densities is necessary .",
    "whereas the density at the star s surface corresponds to the density of iron , the density in the centre of a very massive star can reach 15 times the density of normal nuclear matter . since neutron star matter in chemical equilibrium ( i.e.  generalized @xmath3-equilibrium ) is highly isospin - asymmetric and",
    "may carry net - strangeness its properties can not be explored in laboratory experiments .",
    "therefore , one is left with models for the eos which depend on theoretically motivated assumptions and/or speculations about the behaviour of super dense matter .",
    "one main source of uncertainty is the competition between non - relativistic versus relativistic models .",
    "though both treatments give satisfactory results for normal nuclear densities , they provide quite different results if one extrapolates to higher densities ( see , e.g , huber et al . 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , one encounters strong differences in the high density regime depending on the underlying dynamics , the many - body approximation and the assumptions about the composition .",
    "the simplest approach describes neutron star matter by pure neutron matter . since",
    "pure neutron matter is certainly not the true ground state of neutron star matter , it will quickly decay by means of the weak interaction into chemically equilibrated neutron star matter , whose fundamental constituents  besides neutrons  are protons , hyperons and possibly more massive baryons .",
    "even a transition to quark matter ( so - called hybrid stars ) and the occurrence of pion- or kaon - condensates is possible .",
    "the cross section of a neutron star can be split roughly into three distinct regimes @xcite .",
    "the first one is the star s outer crust , which consists of a lattice of atomic nuclei and a fermi liquid of relativistic , degenerate electrons .",
    "the inner crust extends from neutron drip density , @xmath66 , to a transition density of about @xmath67 @xcite . beyond this transition density @xmath68",
    "one enters the star s third regime , that is , its core where all atomic nuclei have dissolved into their constituents , protons and neutrons .",
    "furthermore , as outlined just above , due to the high fermi pressure the core will contain hyperons , eventually more massive baryon resonances , and possibly a gas of free up , down and strange quarks .",
    "the eos of the outer and inner crust has been studied in several investigations and is rather well known .",
    "we shall adopt for these regions the models derived by haensel & pichon and by negele & vautherin , respectively .",
    "the models for the eos of the star s core are discussed in detail in schaab et al . .",
    "an overview of the collection of eoss used in this paper for the core region is given in tab .",
    "[ tab : eos ] .",
    "we have chosen a representative collection of different models in order to check which eoss are compatible with the qpos and their theoretical interpretation .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     stella & vietri suggested that a third oscillation with a frequency @xmath69 around @xmath0  hz is also produced at the inner border of the accretion disk by lense - thirring precession .",
    "the observed frequencies @xmath69 ( s. tab .",
    "[ tab : qpo ] ) can again be compared with theoretical neutron star models .",
    "the neutron star models are constructed for a given spin frequency @xmath70 and a fixed , unfortunately unknown , star mass @xmath63 .",
    "the obtained monotone relations @xmath71 and @xmath72 are transformed into the relation @xmath73 .",
    "since the lense - thirring precession frequency @xmath74 is , in first approximation , proportional to @xmath70 the relation @xmath75 as function of @xmath52 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot.qpo ] for all eoss .",
    "the observations are shown as circles .",
    "the curves depend only weakly on the neutron star mass .",
    "one can therefore draw conclusions from the comparison of the theoretical curves with the observations , although the star masses are unknown . since both @xmath75 and @xmath52 do not depend on @xmath70 in first approximation , the calculation of the theoretical curves for one specific spin frequency",
    ", @xmath76  hz ( this corresponds to the spin frequency of the neutron star in 4u1728 - 34 ) , is sufficient .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot.qpo ] , the observations of ks1731 - 260 and 4u1735 - 44 agree with the theoretical curves of group 1 , which contains the stiffest eoss of our sample .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of stella & vietri .",
    "however , the other observations , including the observations of the z - sources which are not shown , lie above all theoretical curves .",
    "the observed frequency @xmath69 is thus higher than the lense - thirring precession frequency even for the stiffest eoss . if one assume that the observed frequencies correspond to the first overtone of the lense - thirring precession , the atoll - source observations are in the range of the theoretical curves .    in the case of the z - sources ,",
    "the detected frequencies @xmath77 are not only too large in most sources , but additionally the slope of the relation @xmath78 of the z - source observations is much higher than the slope of @xmath79 for the theoretically determined models . even the assumption , that the first overtone of the lense - thirring precession frequency @xmath74 is detected @xcite can not explain these discrepancies .",
    "in this paper , we derived models of rapidly rotating neutron stars and strange stars by solving the general relativistic structure equations for a broad collection of modern eoss .",
    "we compared the space time geometry of these models with recently discovered qpos in the x - ray brightness of lmxbs .",
    "if one follows the general beat - frequency interpretation of the kilohertz - qpos , i.e. that the higher frequency qpo originates at a stable circular orbit , one can constrain the mass of the neutron star to a range which depends on the eos .",
    "this mass range is for all sources and for all eoss consistent with a canonical mass , @xmath80 . as it was stated by miller et al . and thampan et al .",
    "the exact lower and upper limits of the neutron star s mass can only be determined by using fully relativistic models of rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "the exact limits differ from the approximations with @xmath81 by roughly 10  % .    as it was shown by kaaret et al .",
    "and zhang et al . , the observation of a maximum frequency @xmath82 of the high frequency qpo in the sources 4u1820 - 30 , 4u1608 - 52 , and 4u1636 - 536 favour the interpretation that this qpo originates at the innermost stable orbit",
    ". if this interpretation is correct , the mass of the neutron star can be exactly ( within the observational errors ) determined for a given eos .",
    "the approximately obtained mass , @xmath83 , of the source 4u1820 - 30 is larger than the maximum mass of most of the considered eoss .",
    "this conclusion is even strengthened if the observed maximum frequency @xmath82 is compared with the exact neutron star models .",
    "the only allowed eoss of our broad collection are then the uv@xmath84+uvii  and rhf@xmath85 , which both describe neutron star matter as consisting of nucleons and leptons only .",
    "the derived masses of the three sources lie in the narrow range between @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this result is also of some importance for the nature of the object left in the supernova 1987a . during the first ten seconds after the supernova ,",
    "neutrinos were detected @xcite .",
    "this means that a protoneutron star was formed in the supernova .",
    "the fact that up to now no pulsar emission could be detected was interpreted by bethe & brown that the protoneutron star collapsed to a black hole when the star became transparent to neutrinos after roughly 10  s. the estimated value of the baryonic mass @xmath88 @xcite gives thus an upper limit to the maximum gravitational mass of a neutron star : @xmath89 .",
    "this limit is in clear contradiction to the derived mass of , e.g. 4u1820 - 30 .",
    "it is generally believed that neutron stars are born with a mass about @xmath90 .",
    "neutron stars in lmxbs would therefore accrete @xmath91 during their lifetime .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that some of the neutron stars in lmxbs accrete enough matter to reach the maximally stable mass ( @xmath92 for uv@xmath84+uvii , @xmath93 for rhf@xmath85 ) .",
    "the neutron star would then collapse to a black hole .",
    "the interpretation of the qpo with frequencies",
    "@xmath69 about 10  hz as lense - thirring precession frequency of the accretion disk seems not to be consistent with the theoretical star models , unless one assumes that the first overtone of the precession is observed . in the case of z - sources however , the necessary ratio of the frame dragging frequency and spin frequency , and thus the moment of inertia , of the models if too small compared to the observed frequency @xmath69 or half of it .",
    "our general conclusion is that the observations of kilohertz qpos in lmxbs provide us another powerful tool for probing the interior of neutron stars .",
    "compared to the other tools like observations of the maximum mass @xcite , the limiting spin period @xcite , and cooling simulations @xcite , the derived constraints , especially in the sonic - point - interpretation , are rather strong .",
    "the lower limit @xmath94 is only consistent with two eoss , uv@xmath84+uvii  and rhf@xmath85 , which are relatively stiff at high densities .",
    "their stiff behaviour at high densities seems to be only possible if the neutron star matter consists of neutrons , protons , and leptons only . at the most",
    ", a small admixture of hyperons may be allowed .",
    "however , one has to admit that such a composition somehow contradicts our conception of neutron star matter , since fieldtheoretical models lead more or less inevitably to a more complex composition at high density .",
    "if the given interpretation is correct , one has therefore to reinvestigate the problem of super dense neutron star matter by dropping , for instance , the standard assumptions about the coupling of the hyperons in such regimes .",
    "this specific conclusion depends however on the interpretation of the maximum frequency of the kilohertz qpo within the sonic - point - model . as a kind of beat - frequency model , this model predicts a constant frequency separation @xmath95 .",
    "recently two further examples , where this constancy is not observed , has been discovered : 4u1608 - 52 and 4u1735 - 44 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the frequency separation in the atoll source 4u1636 - 536 seems not to be consistent with the half of the frequency of the qpo in type i bursts @xcite .",
    "though the beat - frequency models are the most hopeful candidates in explaining the qpo - phenomenology it has to be awaited how the variation of the frequency separation and deviation from the qpo frequency in bursts can be incorporated to these models .",
