    "insurance companies can not operate in isolation from financial markets or from other insurance and reinsurance companies .",
    "hence it is important to understand the effect of interaction on the main characteristics of an insurance company .",
    "multivariate risk models , however , present a serious mathematical challenge with few explicit results up to date , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "this paper focuses on a nonstandard , but rather general bivariate risk model and provides an exact analytic study of the corresponding survival probability , borrowing some ideas from the analysis of a somewhat related queueing problem in  @xcite .",
    "the proposed model may be of interest in the context of crisis management due to its relation to contingent surplus notes and mutual insurance .",
    "moreover , it allows for an explicit structural result without imposing overly strict assumptions such as proportional or dominating claims , see section  [ sec : literature ] .",
    "we consider a bivariate cramr - lundberg risk process as a model of surplus of two insurance companies ( or two lines of one insurance business ) .",
    "the special feature of our model is that the companies have a mutual agreement to cover the deficit of each other .",
    "more precisely , if company @xmath0 gets ruined , with its capital decreasing to a value @xmath1 , then company @xmath2 compensates this deficit , bringing the capital of company @xmath0 back to @xmath3 .",
    "however , this comes at a price ; a unit of capital received by company @xmath0 requires @xmath4 from company @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "if this would cause the capital of company @xmath2 to go below @xmath3 , then both companies are said to be ruined .",
    "similarly , if company @xmath2 gets a deficit @xmath5 , company @xmath0 compensates this deficit , but its capital reduces by @xmath6 ; and if this would cause the capital of company @xmath0 to go below @xmath3 , then again both companies are said to be ruined .",
    "finally , ruin may also be caused by a single event bringing the surplus processes of both companies below  0 .",
    "it may be more realistic to assume that if one company can not save the other from ruin then it does not transfer any capital at that instant and continues to operate .",
    "note , however , that survival of both companies in this set - up corresponds to our previous notion of survival .",
    "our main goal in this study is to provide an exact analysis of the ( laplace transform of the ) probability of survival ( i.e. , ruin never occurs ) @xmath7 , as a function of the vector @xmath8 of initial capitals .",
    "we do this by ( i ) expressing the two - dimensional laplace transform @xmath9 of @xmath7 in terms of the transforms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and ( ii ) determining the latter two transforms by solving a wiener - hopf boundary value problem in the case of independent claim streams . in the latter step , a key role",
    "is played by the wiener - hopf factorization of two auxiliary compound poisson processes .    in our terminology ,",
    "if one company can not save the other then both are declared ruined , whereas in practice it is more likely that the company with a positive capital pays out all it has , but then continues its operation .",
    "hence it may be more appropriate to call @xmath12 the probability of survival of _ both _ companies , or the probability that external help is never needed , see remark  [ eremark ] .",
    "one may also notice that it is clearly better ( with respect to survival ) to merge the two lines eliminating transaction costs .",
    "there may be cases , however , where a merger is not possible due to legal , regulatory or other issues .",
    "outside of an insurance context , the two lines may be two separate physical entities such as water reservoirs or energy sources .",
    "furthermore , one may consider the case where @xmath13 for at least one company , see remark  [ rem : less1 ] , so that merging may not be optimal .",
    "this may correspond to the case where part of the deficit is written off or is covered by some other fund .",
    "our model resembles two insurance companies with a mutual insurance fund , which is used to cover the deficit of each of them . in our case , however , there is no separate fund - it is the other company which provides the capital to cover the deficit .",
    "another related notion is that of a contingent surplus note which is a form of a coco bond issued by an insurance company .",
    "this bond pays a higher coupon , because of the risk that it is converted into surplus if a trigger event ( e.g.  deficit ) occurs .",
    "finally , we may consider an insurance company and a governmental fund which is used to save companies from default . in this case capital transfers are only possible from the fund to the company ; this particular scenario is discussed in section  [ sec : restricted ] .",
    "the above - sketched risk model bears some resemblance to a two - dimensional queueing model of two coupled processors .",
    "this model features two @xmath14 queues , each of which , in isolation , is known to be the dual of a cramr - lundberg insurance risk model , cf .",
    "just like in our risk model , the two processors are coupled by the agreement to help each other .",
    "when one of the two @xmath14 queues becomes empty , the service speed of the other server  say , server @xmath15  increases from @xmath0 to @xmath16 , i.e. server @xmath15 is being helped by the idle server .",
    "it should be stressed that this similarity is rather loose and that there is no clear duality relation between these bivariate risk and queueing models .",
    "strikingly , the crucial ideas of the analysis of the coupled processor model in  @xcite apply to our present setup as well .",
    "moreover , solutions to both problems are based on the same wiener - hopf factors , which hints that there might be a certain duality relation between the two .      despite their obvious relevance ,",
    "exact analytic studies of multidimensional risk reserve processes are scarce in the insurance literature . a special , important",
    "case is the setting of proportional reinsurance , which was studied in avram et al .",
    "there it is assumed that there is a single arrival process , and the claims are proportionally split among two reserves . in this case , the two - dimensional exit ( ruin ) problem becomes a _",
    "one_-dimensional first - passage problem above a piece - wise linear barrier .",
    "badescu et al .",
    "@xcite have extended this model by allowing a dedicated arrival stream of claims into only one of the insurance lines .",
    "they show that the transform of the time to ruin of at least one of the reserve processes can be derived using similar ideas as in @xcite .",
    "an early attempt to assess multivariate risk measures can be found in sundt  @xcite , where multivariate panjer recursions are developed which are then used to compute the distribution of the aggregate claim process , assuming simultaneous claim events and discrete claim sizes .",
    "other approaches are deriving integro - differential equations for the various measures of risk and then iterating these equations to find numerical approximations @xcite , or computing bounds for the different types of ruin probabilities that can occur in a setting where more than one insurance line is considered , see  @xcite . in an attempt to solve the integro - differential equations that arise from such models , chan et al .",
    "@xcite derive a riemann - hilbert boundary value problem for the bivariate laplace transform of the joint survival function ( see  @xcite for details about such problems arising in the context of risk and queueing theory and the book @xcite for an extended analysis of similar models in queueing ) .",
    "however , this functional equation for the laplace transform is not solved in @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite a similar functional equation is taken as a departure point , and it is explained how one can find transforms of ruin related performance measures via solutions of the above mentioned boundary value problems .",
    "it is also shown that the boundary value problem has an explicit solution in terms of transforms , if the claim sizes are ordered . in @xcite",
    "this is generalized to the case in which the claim amounts are also correlated with the time elapsed since the previous claim arrival .",
    "bivariate models where one company can transfer its capital to the other have already been considered in the literature .",
    "recently , avram and pistorius  @xcite proposed a model of an insurance company which splits its premiums between a reinsurance / investement fund and a reserves fund necessary for paying claims . in their setting only the second fund receives claims , and hence all capital transfers are one way : from the first fund to the second .",
    "another example is a capital - exchange agreement from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) , where two insurers pay dividends according to a barrier strategy and the dividends of one insurer are transferred to the other unless the other is also fully capitalized .",
    "this work resulted in systems of integro - differential equations for the expected time of ruin and expected discounted dividends , which are hard to solve even in the case of exponential claims .",
    "finally , we briefly list related contributions in the queueing context .",
    "the joint queue length distribution of the coupled processor model has been derived by fayolle and iasnogorodski @xcite , in the case that the service time distributions at both queues are exponential . in their pioneering paper , they showed how the generating function of the joint steady - state queue length distribution can be obtained by solving a riemann - hilbert boundary value problem .",
    "cohen and boxma @xcite generalized this queueing model by allowing general service time distributions .",
    "they obtained the laplace - stieltjes transform of the joint steady - state workload distribution by solving a wiener - hopf boundary value problem . in @xcite the model of @xcite was extended by considering a pair of coupled queues driven by independent spectrally positive lvy processes and a compact solution was obtained .",
    "there the model was also linked to a two - server fluid network .",
    "in section  [ model ] we describe the model in detail . in section  [ survival ]",
    "we derive an integral equation for the survival probability @xmath7 , as a function of the vector @xmath8 of initial amounts of capital .",
    "section  [ kernel ] is devoted to the derivation of a so - called kernel equation for the two - dimensional laplace transform of @xmath7 , see proposition  [ prop : kernel ] .",
    "after a brief discussion of the net profit condition , in section  [ profit ] , we solve the kernel equation in the case of independent claim streams in section  [ solution ] .",
    "the main result is given in theorem  [ thm : main ] , which is then illustrated by two simple examples . in section  [ sec : restricted ] we specialize to a model of non - mutual insurance , where help is provided by only one company ( or government ) .",
    "some open problems are discussed in section  [ open ] .",
    "consider a bivariate cramr - lundberg risk process @xmath17 with initial capitals @xmath18 , premium rates @xmath19 , claim arrival rate @xmath20 and a joint claim size distribution @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , @xmath22 where @xmath23 are iid distributed according to  @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is an independent poisson process of rate  @xmath20 . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath24 does not have mass at @xmath26 .",
    "next , we define the corresponding bivariate laplace exponent by @xmath27    [ rem : independent ] note that this model incorporates the case of two independent risk processes with claim arrival rates @xmath28 and claim size distributions @xmath29 with the relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the dirac point mass at  0 .",
    "this yields @xmath32 with @xmath33    throughout this work we assume that the companies have a mutual agreement of deficit coverage : when a claim brings the surplus of a company @xmath34 below 0 then the other company @xmath35 transfers just enough capital to bring it to 0 so that company @xmath15 can continue its operation .",
    "if company @xmath36 has not enough capital then ruin occurs .",
    "we also assume that a capital transfer incurs some proportional cost : a unit of capital received by @xmath15 requires @xmath37 capital from @xmath36 .",
    "it is noted that in the case of no transaction costs our risk problem reduces to a classical one - dimensional problem obtained by considering the total surplus , see section  [ sec : nocost ] .",
    "[ rem : less1 ] all of the results below hold for any @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "even the latter condition can be removed , except that then the second statement in  proposition  [ prop : phi ] may no longer be true .",
    "it is convenient to consider a more general model defined for all times @xmath40 , where ruin is avoided using capital from external sources .",
    "more precisely , if company @xmath36 has insufficient funds to save @xmath15 then it transfers to @xmath15 all its capital and the rest of the required capital is taken from the shareholders of company  @xmath15 ( or some other external source ) .",
    "mathematically , we can describe the bivariate surplus process @xmath41 in the following way : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the cumulative amounts of capital received by the @xmath15-th company from the other company and from an external source respectively ; @xmath45 .",
    "note that the time of ruin in the original model is given by @xmath46 in this work we only address the probability of survival @xmath47 .",
    "note that in our setup the concepts of ruin and survival have unambiguous meaning , which should be compared to various possible ruin concepts in standard bivariate risk models , see  @xcite . in the following we provide two mathematical definitions of the processes involved in  : a recursive definition and a definition as a modified skorokhod problem .",
    "[ eremark ] we note that the external sources @xmath48 are introduced only for modeling convenience .",
    "throughout this work survival means survival in the original model which corresponds to never using external capital in the extended model .",
    "hence @xmath48 never appear in the following apart from the discussion of the net profit condition in section  [ profit ] and direct calculations in section  [ sec : nocost ] . nevertheless , we believe that it is important to have an explicit model definition as given by   and  , see also section  [ open ] .",
    "let us remark that the processes @xmath49 are piece - wise constant and non - decreasing , and can have jumps at claim arrival times @xmath50 only .",
    "one may define these processes recursively by considering their jumps at time @xmath51 for @xmath52 more precisely , with @xmath53 we have the following cases :    * @xmath54 : @xmath49 have no jumps ( at @xmath51 ) , * @xmath55 : @xmath56 has a jump @xmath57 ( and no other jumps at @xmath51 ) , * @xmath58 : @xmath59 has a jump @xmath60 , * @xmath61 : @xmath56 has a jump @xmath62 and @xmath63 has a jump @xmath64 , * @xmath65 : @xmath59 has a jump @xmath66 and @xmath67 has a jump @xmath68 , * @xmath69 : @xmath48 has a jump @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the following equivalent specification of our model closely resembles a multidimensional skorokhod problem , see  @xcite building upon skorokhod s one dimensional construction  @xcite .",
    "it is noted that for the classical bivariate skorokhod problem one must assume that @xmath72 which is clearly violated in our setup .",
    "we consider the equations in   with the following additional requirements :    * @xmath73 and @xmath49 are piece - wise constant and non - decreasing , * the jump times of @xmath74 are contained in @xmath75 , * the jump times of @xmath48 are contained in @xmath76 , * out of @xmath77 the only pairs which can jump simultaneously are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is easy to check that these requirements are satisfied by the recursive construction from section  [ sec : recursive ] , and that no other choices of @xmath49 and thus @xmath80 satisfy these conditions .",
    "a few words about the above requirements .",
    "the second states that a company receives capital when in need , and the third states that external capital can be used only when both companies are in need ( or one is at 0 after trying to save the other ) .",
    "the final condition is necessary to prevent redundant capital transfers .",
    "as stated in remark  [ eremark ] , we now ignore the possibility of funding by external sources .",
    "consider @xmath81 , the probability of survival for the initial capitals @xmath82 , and put for convenience @xmath83 if @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",

    "in fact , there are essential difficulties in each step leading to theorem  [ thm : main ] :    * _ definition of the model_. in general one can not use the recursive definition of section  [ sec : recursive ] . the definition in section  [ sec : skorokhod ] ( or a variant of it ) seems to be a natural one .",
    "nevertheless one has to establish that there is a unique solution to this modified skorokhod problem . * _ the kernel equation_. we believe that proposition  [ prop : kernel ] holds for a general bivariate lvy process @xmath329 with negative jumps .",
    "one may try to employ the generator of the underlying markov process instead of an @xmath91 reasoning .",
    "there are various problems on this way including the required smoothness of the survival function .",
    "alternatively , one may try to use a martingale approach , but the choice of an appropriate martingale is far from trivial . * _ identification of boundary measures_. one may follow the ideas from the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] . in the lvy case ,",
    "a highly problematic step is to bound both sides of   by a constant .    secondly , it is important to understand if the kernel equation in proposition  [ prop : kernel ] characterizes the survival probability in some sense . in the case of a reflected brownian motion in a quadrant",
    "the basic adjoint relation characterizes the stationary distribution together with the boundary measures , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "this property allowed dai and harrison  @xcite to construct an algorithm computing the stationary distribution based on the basic adjoint relation .",
    "finally , one may try to interpret theorem  [ thm : main ] ( and the quite similar theorem  1 in  @xcite ) to provide a probabilistic approach .",
    "moreover , one may consider some alternative risk measures of the model in   such as discounted external injections of capital .",
    "one may also try to extend the model to a setting with multiple companies .",
