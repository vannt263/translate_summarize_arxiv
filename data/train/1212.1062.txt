    "in the last few decades , neutrino oscillation experiments have conclusively shown that neutrinos are massive  @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of the standard model is thus to be extended to accommodate the neutrino masses . in many possible extension of the standard model , neutral heavy leptons",
    "are often predicted . in the seesaw mechanism  @xcite for example ,",
    "the right - handed neutrinos are introduced and they weakly mix with the ordinary neutrinos after the electroweak symmetry breaking .    for the masses of the heavy neutrinos , a wide range of possibilities has been discussed in literature . in the canonical picture of the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "heavy neutrino masses are supposed to be around the grand unification scale .",
    "these super - heavy neutrinos can account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe by the leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "another possibility to account for the baryon asymmetry has been suggested in  @xcite and further studied in  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "two quasi - degenerate heavy neutrinos of @xmath7 play a crucial role in the early universe .",
    "heavy neutrinos in the mass range @xmath8 could enhance the energy transport from the core to the stalled shock and favor the supernova explosion  @xcite .",
    "heavy neutrinos with a few kev mass have also attracted much interests as a viable dark matter candidate  @xcite and an agent of the pulsar velocities  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the dark matter and the baryon asymmetry due to kev and gev heavy neutrinos can originate in a simple framework so called @xmath9msm  @xcite , which is an extension of the standard model with just three generations of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "besides the super - heavy range much larger than tev , such heavy neutrinos can be tested in existing and forthcoming experiments due to lower threshold energies of production ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper , we focus on the heavy neutrinos produced by kaon decays .",
    "the previous neutrino experiments , including peak searches in the meson decays  @xcite and the decay searches with accelerators  @xcite , have placed stringent bounds on the mixing parameters in this mass range . in particular ,",
    "ps191  @xcite has placed the strongest bounds for the mixing parameters in the mass range of @xmath2 . since the ps191 experiment in 1984 , however , no further experiments of this type of decay search have performed and the bounds have not been updated for about 30 years . on the other hand ,",
    "great progress has been made in neutrino oscillation experiments over the same period .",
    "it is interesting to note that typical long or short baseline experiments are equipped with the ( near ) detectors placed at @xmath10 meters away from the beam targets , which detectors are capable of measuring the charged - particle tracks produced by the heavy neutrino decays .",
    "a natural question is then whether the existing accelerator - based neutrino experiments are capable of discovering the heavy neutrinos and how sensitive such experiments are .",
    "we believe that this is a timely question to ask .",
    "in fact , the exposure of ps191 is about @xmath11 while the recent accelerator - based neutrino experiments are expected to achieve @xmath12 with the near detectors which are typically no smaller than @xmath13 by factor of @xmath14 .",
    "table  [ t1 ] shows a comparison between ps191 and several examples of recent neutrino experiments . among several options of accelerator experiments , in this paper we focus on the t2k experiment as a typical example .",

    "the item `` events '' shows pot@xmath15(distance)@xmath16@xmath15volume in units of ps191 .",
    "the pots for the oscillation experiments are assumed to achieve @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the study follows two main steps ;  the flux estimation and the event number calculation for various signal decays .",
    "first , in the fulx estimation , we use a semi - analytical method with a help of the active neutrino flux @xmath17 simulated by the t2k collaboration  @xcite , making a reasonable simplification for the geometry of the decay tunnel and the detector .",
    "more precise fluxes of the heavy neutrino might be obtained by monte carlo methods . in a monte carlo calculation",
    "it is possible to take into account the details of the geometry and the spectrum of the parent mesons .",
    "the analytical technique is nevertheless useful , since it allows one to understand the essential physics which determines the behavior of the heavy neutrino spectrum , in particular its mass dependence .",
    "we emphasize that the phase - space effect in kaon decay is important and the heavy neutrino flux @xmath18 can be significantly deviated from the naive expectation @xmath19 approaches to the production threshold , the heavy neutrinos tend to be distributed to lower energies with a narrow spread , so that the proportionality @xmath20 is broken .",
    "this phase - space effect leads to larger event numbers than the naive expectation and has a significant impact for the estimation of the sensitivity .",
    "second , in the event number calculation , we take into account various decay modes of the heavy neutrino @xmath21 .",
    "the two - body modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the most promising channels due to their large branching ratios . for these modes , the invariant mass distribution for the lepton and the pion momenta has a peak at the heavy neutrino mass .",
    "the three - body modes @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are also interesting . while the first mode may suffer higher background by @xmath27 decay , the latter two modes have smaller backgrounds and also serve as promising channels for discovering the heavy neutrino . by assuming non - observation of these exotic events in the t2k near detector at @xmath12 , one finds",
    "the upper - bound for the mixing parameter of the electron type better than that of ps191 .",
    "this means that t2k may have a good chance to discover the heavy neutrino in near future .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the heavy neutrino and briefly review its essential properties . in section 3 , the flux of the heavy neutrino at the near detector is discussed . in section 4 , the decays of the heavy neutrino at the detector and their event numbers are studied .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we consider a heavy ( sterile ) neutrino @xmath21 in the mass range @xmath0 .",
    "the flavor eigenstates of the left - handed neutrinos @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are given by the linear combination of the mass eigenstates as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are the mass eigenstates of the active neutrinos .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the mixing between ( light ) active and sterile neutrinos , through which @xmath21 interacts with the weak gauge bosons .",
    "the extension to the multi - generation case is trivially done by replacing @xmath35 with @xmath36 . in this paper",
    ", we assume @xmath21 is dirac particle unless otherwise stated .",
    "this is simply because we would like to make a comparison to ps191 in which the same assumption is made . if @xmath21 is majorana particle , the decay width is doubled since @xmath21 decays to charge - conjugated states also .",
    "let us overview the way to find the heavy neutrino @xmath21 in accelerator experiments , especially in the t2k experiment . in the mass range of @xmath2 ,",
    "the heavy neutrino @xmath21 is produced by @xmath37 decay .",
    "the main production modes are @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . the decay width @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is proportional to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , and @xmath45 is irrelevant for the production can decay producing tau so that @xmath45 is involved in the production . in this work",
    "we neglect the contribution from such heavier mesons . ] .",
    "we describe further details of the decay modes  ( [ kton ] ) in section 3 and appendix a. since the magnetic horn focuses positively - charged mesons , the contributions from @xmath46 are small  @xcite and in what follows we neglect the @xmath46 contributions .",
    "the heavy neutrinos @xmath21 produced by",
    "the meson decays escape from the decay volume and some of them are injected into the near detector nd280 in the t2k experiment and decay to leave signals .",
    "depending on the mass , @xmath21 decays to lighter particles in various decay modes ; @xmath47 with the nd280 detector capable of identifying @xmath48 and @xmath49 , some of the above channels can be detected as signal events .",
    "due to large branching ratios , the two - body decay modes @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 would be the most frequent events .",
    "however , @xmath50 does not seems to be as promising as the other two modes since @xmath27 are copiously produced by the ordinary neutrino interactions , which lead to large backgrounds . on the other hand , @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath52 leave two charged - particle tracks with monochromatic energies in the rest frame of @xmath21 .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the two charged - particle momenta sharply peaks at the heavy neutrino mass .",
    "such a peak signal is definitely better than a slight excess of @xmath27 events over huge background .",
    "we thus proceed without any further analysis of @xmath50 , but study @xmath51 and @xmath52 in more detail in section 4 .",
    "the decay rates of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are proportional to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath55 is induced at one loop and negligible in this work .    in spite of small branching ratios , the three - body decay modes @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are also interesting to study .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 and @xmath26 have smaller backgrounds than @xmath24 and a few these events may lead to the discovery of the heavy neutrino .",
    "notice that @xmath24 and @xmath26 are conducted not only by the charged - current ( cc ) interaction but also by the neutral current ( nc ) interaction , so that these decay rates depend on all types of the mixing parameters @xmath56 . on the other hand , @xmath25 are mediated only by the cc interactions and the decay rate depends on @xmath57 .",

    "@xcite , and then evaluate the heavy neutrino flux from the reconstructed parent flux . in this paper , we focus on @xmath62 meson as the parent of the heavy neutrinos since @xmath62 decay covers a wider range of the heavy neutrino mass than @xmath63 decay .",
    "the following discussion is , however , easily extended to the @xmath63 case .      for nd280 ,",
    "the neutrino source is a line - like object rather than a point - like one .",

    "the location of nd280 relative to each @xmath62 momentum depends on these degrees of freedom and the function @xmath84 is in fact highly complicated . however , the situation is greatly simplified if kaon momenta are assumed to be parallel to the beam axis .",

    "the invariant mass distribution of the electron pair is useful since it moderately peaks at one - half of the heavy neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "the analysis needs anyway precise understanding of the background , and the detection via @xmath24 seems less promising than the two - body modes .    as for @xmath179 , the charmed - meson production by the neutrino cc interaction  @xcite and successive semi - leptonic decay may become the background .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section of the charm production is about @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) of the total cc cross section for @xmath182 . due to the off - axis technic ,",
    "however , the contributions from such high - energy neutrinos are suppressed in the t2k setup . by selecting the events in argon gas",
    ", the neutrino reduction rates can be further reduced , and @xmath179 may become more or less background free .",
    "although ps191 has not studied the signal process @xmath26 open for @xmath183 , it should be emphasized that searching for this di - muon signal is also a promising method .",
    "the main background for @xmath26 may be the charmed - meson production by the neutrino cc interaction  @xcite and successive semi - leptonic decay as in the case of @xmath179 .",
    "this rate is , however , expected to be small for the neutrino energy in t2k .",
    "so far we have focused on the comparison between t2k and ps191 and @xmath45 is accordingly neglected . in this subsection , we comment on several implications of the @xmath184 case .    since @xmath45 is not involved in the main production processes such as pion and kaon decays , the experimental constraints of @xmath185 are much wearker than that of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "the lower - filled region is the regime where the lifetime of the heavy neutrino is longer than @xmath186 . by comparing fig .",
    "[ taubbn ] and fig .",
    "[ tot ] , it is seen that , unlike @xmath187 , @xmath185 can be large enough so that the bbn constraint is avoided without contradicting with the upper bound from the direct experiments .    while @xmath45 is not involved in the production processes , the detection processes in general depend on @xmath45 since @xmath24 and @xmath26 are induced not only by the cc but also by the nc interactions  @xcite .",
    "this means the experimental setup discussed in this paper has sensitivities to certain combinations of @xmath187 and @xmath185 . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us focus on a simple case where @xmath188 and @xmath183 . in this case",
    ", the heavy neutrinos are produced by @xmath42 and can be detected by @xmath26 . since @xmath54 is small , the decay process @xmath26 is conducted only by the nc interactions and the decay width becomes proportional to @xmath189 .",
    "therefore by analyzing the dimuon signals in the detector , one is able to constraint @xmath190 for @xmath183 ( or discover the heavy neutrino ) .",

    "[ bounds3 ] , the solid ( dashed ) curve is the contour for @xmath163 events with @xmath191 . from fig .",
    "[ boundttau ] and fig .  [ taubbn ] , one can see that there exists the parameter regime where the dimuon signal is sizable while the success of bbn is unspoiled .",
    "for example , it is seen that the combination @xmath192 and @xmath193 is bbn safe but @xmath194 events of @xmath26 are expected for @xmath195 .",
    "interestingly , this case also predicts @xmath196 events of @xmath197 ( see the left pannel of fig .",
    "[ bounds2 ] ) , so that the heavy neutrino model can be tested in multi - dimensional way .",
    "in this paper , we have focused on the heavy ( sterile ) neutrinos produced by kaon decays and explored the feasibility of their detection at the existing facilities of the accelerator - based neutrino experiment .",
    "taking the t2k experiment as a typical example , we have estimated the heavy neutrino fluxes produced in the beam line and calculated the event rates of their decay taking place inside the detector .    due to massive nature of the heavy neutrino ,",
    "the spectrum of the heavy neutrino is significantly different from that of the ordinary neutrinos .",
    "the ordinary neutrinos are emitted to various directions in the laboratory frame due to their tiny masses .",
    "on the other hand the heavy neutrinos carrying a large mass tend to be emitted to the forward directions and frequently hit the detector .",
    "this is a unique advantage of the experiments in which the parent mesons decay in flight with sufficient gamma factors .    among various decay modes ,",
    "@xmath51 open for @xmath153 is one of the most promising channels for detection because of its larger rate and lower background .",
    "the backgrounds from the active neutrino reactions can be reduced by selecting the events occurring in the regions filled with no material . in the t2k near dector",
    ", the tpc volume @xmath198 filled with argon gas plays this role . the expected sensitivity for this mode is better than that of ps191 , which has placed the most stringent bound on the heavy neutrino mixing .",
    "the three body modes @xmath24 , @xmath179 , and @xmath26 are also interesting signals to search for . in particular , @xmath24 and @xmath26 are conducted not only by the charged current but also the neutral current , so that the tau flavor mixing @xmath45 is involved in the detection probabilities . since @xmath199 is less constrained than @xmath200 and @xmath201 , the above two modes",
    "are not necessarily suppressed when @xmath200 and @xmath201 are small such that the two - body modes @xmath51 and @xmath52 are beyond the reach .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that two quasi - degenerate heavy neutrinos of @xmath7 can account for not only the neutrino masses in oscillation experiments but also the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the heavy neutrinos studied in this work are thus quite interesting targets to search for .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite reports that the sterile neutrinos with mass @xmath202 could facilitate the energy transport from the supernova core to the schock front , prompting a successful explosion .",
    "the needed mixing is either @xmath203 or @xmath204 for @xmath54 .",
    "interestingly , t2k can probe latter case via the @xmath179 mode ( see the right pannel of fig .",
    "[ bounds3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , heavy neutrinos with masses smaller than @xmath205 mev may give a significant effect on the neutrinoless double beta decays  @xcite .",
    "according to a rough estimation in table  [ t1 ] , miniboone and sciboone have comparable abilities to t2k so that these experiments equally have the chance to probe these interesting possibilities .",
