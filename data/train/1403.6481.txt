    "the unitary evolution of many - body quantum systems is an active area of research with studies being carried out theoretically and also experimentally . in experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite , and",
    "especially those with optical lattices  @xcite , the effects of the environment take time to become relevant , which allows for treating the systems as quasi - isolated . in this context , much attention has been given to the subject of quench dynamics , where the evolution of an isolated quantum system initiates with an instantaneous perturbation that takes a certain initial hamiltonian @xmath0 into a new final hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "studies of quenched many - body quantum systems deal with fundamental problems of physics , such as advancing our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum physics and deriving thermodynamics from quantum mechanics . among the several specific questions that have been raised , we address three that we have been particularly interested in  @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) how fast can isolated many - body quantum systems evolve ?",
    "we try to answer this question by studying the fidelity decay ( loschmidt echo ) and the evolution of few - body observables .",
    "the fidelity corresponds to the overlap between the initial state and its evolved counterpart .",
    "it is obtained by fourier transforming the energy distribution of the initial state .",
    "the fidelity is also analogous to the characteristic function of the probability distribution of work  @xcite , which is essential in studies about work statistics in quantum thermodynamics .",
    "the minimum fidelity decay time was derived from the time - energy uncertainty relation  @xcite and can be reached in particular scenarios . in the general picture of quench dynamics , where the energy distribution of the initial state is usually single - peaked , we show that the fastest possible decay occurs for evolutions under full random matrices  @xcite .",
    "full random matrices provide a way to acquire statistical information about complex systems , but they also imply simultaneous interactions of many particles , which is unrealistic . in realistic systems with two - body interactions ,",
    "the fastest fidelity decay is gaussian .",
    "this happens when the energy distribution of the initial state is also gaussian and fills the energy shell .",
    "the latter gives the maximum possible spreading of initial states projected onto final two - body - interaction hamiltonians .",
    "thus , the minimum relaxation time for such realistic systems occurs when the gaussian behavior of the fidelity holds until saturation  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of few - body observables depends not only on the interplay between the initial state and final hamiltonian , as the fidelity , but also on the details about the observable , which makes the problem more difficult . however , if the observable commutes with the initial hamiltonian , its short - time dynamics is partly controlled by the fidelity behavior , which allows for a simple picture of the observable evolution .",
    "\\(ii ) how large are the time fluctuations of observables around the steady state after relaxation ?",
    "equilibration in isolated quantum systems can happen in a probabilistic sense .",
    "it requires that the time fluctuations be small , implying proximity to the stationary state for the vast majority of time , and that the fluctuations decrease with system size , vanishing in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we show that the temporal fluctuations of the fidelity decay exponentially with system size .",
    "this is in agreement with our analyses for the fluctuations of observables and holds for chaotic and also integrable systems , provided the spectrum be not highly degenerate  @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) after relaxation , what are the conditions for the new reached equilibrium to be thermal ?",
    "thermalization occurs when the infinite time averages of few - body observables coincide with thermal averages .",
    "it is certain to occur when the energy distribution of the initial state fills the energy shell ergodically .",
    "any eigenstate from a full random matrix projected on the energy eigenbasis of a final two - body - interaction hamiltonian , chaotic or integrable , falls in this category .",
    "but this is not a very interesting case , since such initial states have infinite temperature and are already thermal before the quench  @xcite . for the realistic scenario of initial states of finite temperature",
    ", the expectation is that thermalization is viable when the final hamiltonian is chaotic and the energy of the initial state is away from the edges of the spectrum of @xmath1 ( the borders are problematic , because the states there are not strongly mixed for systems with few - body interactions ) @xcite . we provide illustrations supporting this idea .",
    "we show that the infinite time average and the thermodynamic average approach each other as the energy of the initial state moves closer to the center of the spectrum , the perturbation gets stronger , and the system size increases .",
    "this holds for global and also local quenches in space  @xcite .",

    "full random matrices are often employed to model the spectrum of many - body quantum systems .",
    "they are filled with random numbers and satisfy the symmetries of the system they aim at describing .",
    "their level spacing distributions show level repulsion  @xcite . however , despite the agreement with the spectra of complex systems , full random matrices are unrealistic , because they imply the simultaneous interactions of many particles .",
    "realistic systems have few - body interactions .",
    "these systems also show level repulsion when they are in the chaotic domain , but other properties differ from full random matrices . for example , the density of states of full random - matrices has a semicircular shape and all of their eigenstates are pseudo - random vectors , whereas in realistic systems with few - body interactions the density of states is gaussian and the eigenstates can only reach a high level of delocalization in the middle of the spectrum , being more localized at the edges  @xcite .      the realistic systems that we investigate correspond to spin-1/2 models with two - body interactions and no randomness .",

    "this is done by searching for the @xmath89 that is closest to the energy @xmath191 where @xmath192 is boltzmann constant and it is set to 1 .    in the weak coupling limit ( although non - perturbative regime ) , the ldos of the initial states projected onto @xmath174 and @xmath175 is lorentzian , causing an exponential decay of the fidelity for both cases  @xcite .",

    "the relative differences are of similar magnitude for both models and clearly decrease with @xmath2 .",
    "they also decrease with the perturbation , but appear to reach a minimum before increasing again .",

    "the results reinforce the equivalence between the two models for the chosen values of @xmath100 and @xmath97 .",

    "this work overviews our recent studies of the behavior of isolated quantum systems with interactions from the moment they are taken out of equilibrium instantaneously until the time they reach a new equilibrium .",
    "we have employed one - dimensional spin-1/2 models , which are prototypes of many - body quantum systems .",
    "only two - body interactions have been included .",
    "we summarize our results as follows .",
    "\\(i ) _ dynamics : _ for realistic systems with two - body interactions , the probability of finding the initial state in time , the so - called fidelity , can show a gaussian behavior until relaxation  @xcite .",
    "this happens in the strong coupling regime , when the energy distribution of the initial state has a gaussian shape , and it sets the minimum relaxation time for these systems : @xmath199 .",
    "faster decays require more - body interactions , the extreme being the case of full random matrices , which sets the ultimate lower bound for the relaxation time of initial states with single - peaked energy distributions . for goes ,",
    "the relaxation time is obtained from @xmath200 ^ 2/(\\sigma_{\\text{ini}}^2 t_r^2 ) = 3/{\\cal d}$ ] .",
    "initial states showing separates peaks in energy when projected in the eigenbasis of @xmath1 can lead to decays faster than random matrices , but they were not discussed here .    the analysis of the evolution of few - body observables is still under progress .",
    "we have so far developed a simple picture for the observables that commute with the initial hamiltonian . in this case , the short - time dynamics is partially controlled by the fidelity . for initial states corresponding to site - basis vectors and using the expression for the fidelity , we can derive analytical expressions for @xmath111 that describe very well the numerical results  @xcite .",
    "it remains to describe the evolution at longer times and for general observables .",
    "\\(ii ) _ fluctuations after relaxation : _ overall the time fluctuations after relaxation decay exponentially with system size , even when the system is integrable , provided it does not have a high number of degeneracies  @xcite .",
    "the size of the fluctuations depends on the observables and on the level of delocalization of the initial state in the energy eigenbasis . for the fidelity ,",
    "the dispersion is given by latexmath:[$\\sigma_f = \\sqrt { \\text{ipr}_{\\text{ini}}^{-2 }   - \\sum_{\\alpha }      \\(iii ) _ thermalization : _ the condition for reaching thermal equilibrium when the initial state is not already thermal before the quench is given by eth .",
    "it requires that the eigenstate expectation values of few - body observables do not fluctuate much for eigenstates close in energy and that these fluctuations approach zero as the system size increases .",
    "this picture holds when the quench takes the system into the chaotic domain , since the eigenstates becomes similar to random vectors .",
    "in addition , for realistic systems with few - body interactions , the energy of the initial state can not be too close to the edges of the spectrum of @xmath1 , where the eigenstates are more localized  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that local and global quenches in space can take the system into the chaotic domain . in both cases and in agreement with eth ,",
    "the eigenstate expectation values of few - body observables show minor fluctuations for states close in energy and , away from the edges of the spectrum , they decrease with system size  @xcite .",
    "the viability of thermalization is then inferred from the comparison between the infinite time averages and the microcanonical averages .",
    "they get closer as the perturbation increases , the initial state moves toward the middle of the spectrum , and the system size increases .    in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", it has been shown that integrable systems can not thermalize  @xcite , provided the initial state is not right at the middle of the spectrum , where the temperature is infinite .",
    "it remains to elucidate where the threshold is located , that is how close to the middle of the spectrum the initial state needs to be for thermal behavior to be possible in integrable systems and how close to the borders of the spectrum of a gapless chaotic system it can be for thermalization to occur ."
