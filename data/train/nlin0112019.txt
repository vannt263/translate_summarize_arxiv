    "during the last decade , dynamical instability and chaos in systems of interacting particles has become a problem of major preoccupation in statistical mechanics .",
    "many systems have been shown to present sensitivity to initial conditions characterized by positive lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "methods from kinetic theory have been developed for the maximal lyapunov exponent and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy of dilute gases @xcite .",
    "the relationships to transport properties have also been investigated @xcite .    in mixtures of a one - component fluid with a very low concentration of identical tracer particles the largest lyapunov exponent",
    "may either be virtually identical to the largest lyapunov exponent of the pure fluid ( with just a slight perturbation caused by the tracer particles ) , or it may be larger , due to the dynamical properties of the tracer particles . in the latter case one may say that the largest lyapunov exponent is _ dominated by the tracer particles_.    the purpose of the present paper is to describe the regimes in which the tracer particles dominate the dynamical instability of the fluid system .",
    "if the mass of the tracer particle is not much larger than that of the fluid particles , and in addition the mean free path of both bath and tracer particles are at least comparable in length to their respective radii , the characteristic lyapunov exponents for fluid and tracer dynamics respectively are roughly of the order of their respective collision frequencies .",
    "so in this case one may conclude that the tracer particle will dominate if its collision frequency is sufficiently larger than that of the fluid particles .",
    "one obvious way to reach this goal is by making the mass ratio @xmath0 of tracer mass over fluid particle mass very small .",
    "the limit where this ratio goes to zero corresponds to the lorentz gas , for which the lyapunov exponents of the tracer particle were derived several years ago  @xcite .",
    "another common situation is where the radius of the tracer particles is much larger than that of the fluid particles , e.g. , when one satisfies the conditions for brownian motion , where also the mass of the tracer particle is much larger than that of the fluid particles . in this case",
    "the collision frequency of the tracer particles is much higher than that of the fluid particles , but at the same time the velocity changes of the tracer particle in collisions with a bath particle are much smaller than those of the bath particles themselves .",
    "in addition the curvature of the brownian particle , due to its large radius , is much smaller than that of a fluid particle and therefore the diverging effect ( crucial for a positive lyapunov exponent ) of a brownian - fluid collision is much smaller than that of a fluid - fluid collision . as a result of this",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent usually is determined by the fluid particles , as noted both by louis and gaspard  @xcite and by nasser and dorfman  @xcite .",
    "however , there is one noteworthy exception to this , corresponding to the so - called rayleigh - flight limit , where at fixed brownian mass and radius the radius of the fluid particles is sent to zero . in the extreme limit of a brownian gas surrounded by an ideal gas",
    "it is obvious that the brownian particle has to dominate , as the lyapunov exponents of the ideal gas are strictly zero .",
    "the goal of the present paper is thus to study these cases of dominance of the lyapunov spectrum by the tracer particle .",

    "in this paper we will consider a system composed of many fluid particles and one tracer particle . from a general viewpoint ,",
    "this system can be considered as a binary mixture of @xmath1 fluid particles , which we take to be hard spheres of radius @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 , with @xmath4 tracer particles , which will likewise be hard spheres , with radius @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 .",
    "all the @xmath7 hard balls move in a rectangular domain of finite extension @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions .    the motion of the hard balls is composed of free flights between binary collisions which are elastic and instantaneous . energy and the total linear momenta are conserved .",
    "for a system of hard balls of radii @xmath9 and of masses @xmath10 , the equations of motion are given as follows in terms of the positions and velocities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively before and after the collision at time @xmath13 :      @xmath14      @xmath15    @xmath16    with the unit vector joining the centers of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 balls at the collision given by @xmath19 and the relative velocity vector @xmath20      the dynamical instability of this system is characterized by the rates of exponential growth of infinitesimal perturbations on the positions and velocities of the particles : @xmath21 .",
    "the rates are called the lyapunov exponents @xmath22 depending on the initial perturbation @xmath23 we may have as many different lyapunov exponents as there are independent directions in phase space . since the dynamics of the present hard - ball system is of hamiltonian ( symplectic ) character",
    "the lyapunov exponents obey a pairing rule : _ if @xmath24 is a lyapunov exponent , then @xmath25 is also a lyapunov",
    "exponent_. the set of exponents form the so - called lyapunov spectrum .",
    "the lyapunov exponents associated with the directions perpendicular to the energy and momenta shells vanish . in the present system , which has no fixed points except at zero energy , this also holds for the pair mates associated with the directions of time and center - of - mass translation .",

    "moreover , this distribution has long tails due to so - called _ grazing collisions _ , i.e. , collisions with small scattering angles .",
    "as one sees from the second term in ( [ de ] ) these may give rise to arbitrarily large jumps in @xmath161 and @xmath169 of the order of @xmath204 as a consequence of the distribution ( [ proba.phi.2d ] ) , in @xmath54 , or ( [ proba.phi.3d ] ) , in @xmath56 the tails of the probability density behave as @xmath205 therefore the first moments of this distribution exist .",
    "however , the slow decay of the distribution for large jumps leads to logarithmic divergences of the second moments of @xmath206 .",
    "when the jumps in @xmath161 and @xmath207 at collisions are mostly small compared to the typical magnitudes of @xmath161 and @xmath207 themselves , it seems appropriate approximating the boltzmann equation by a fokker - planck equation . for this to be the case we again",

    "but their divergence is only logarithmic and therefore the process , to leading order in @xmath145 , can still be described by a fokker - planck equation .",
    "the typical scale for the jumps in @xmath161 and @xmath162 is of order @xmath208 with @xmath144 .",
    "consequently , if we introduce a cut - off in the calculation of the second moment at values of @xmath192 and @xmath209 satisfying @xmath210 with some @xmath211 , most of the distribution @xmath206 falls within the cut - offs .",

    "there is no drift in @xmath207 because @xmath217 by symmetry .",
    "for the same reason , the coefficient of cross - diffusion in @xmath161 and @xmath207 vanishes .",

    "it is precisely those solutions that we are interested in .",
    "continuing with hard spheres we note that , with vanishing first moments , the fokker - planck equation may be rescaled by applying the scalings @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 .",
    "this allows us to extract the dependence of the variables on the expression @xmath230 .",
    "the only remaining parameter that might change on varying the ratio s of masses and diameters is the ratio @xmath231 .",
    "but even this will change just very slightly , and in fact only does so because the cut - offs on @xmath192 and @xmath209 in determining the second moments introduce a @xmath145-dependence which works out somewhat differently for @xmath232 and @xmath233 . in the limit",
    "@xmath234 this ratio has a well - defined limit .    from this scaling",
    "we may conclude immediately that @xmath235 , and hence the maximal lyapunov exponent , scales as @xmath236 and we finally obtain that @xmath237 with the parameter @xmath145 defined in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "a discussion is now in order to justify the introduction of the cut - off .",
    "as mentioned already , the second moments of the distribution @xmath238 diverge logarithmically .",
    "this implies that in principle we should stick with the boltzmann equation ( [ boltz ] ) .",
    "still , the typical scale for the jumps in @xmath161 and @xmath162 is of order @xmath145 , whereas the typical scale for variations of @xmath161 and @xmath162 is expected to be at least approximately of order @xmath239 , so much larger .",
    "therefore , the approximation of @xmath240 in ( [ boltz ] ) by a second order taylor expansion should still be correct for values of @xmath241 and @xmath242 up to @xmath243 , with @xmath244 some small positive constant .",
    "in addition it can be estimated that the contributions to the boltzmann equation from @xmath241- and @xmath242-values outside the cut - off are smaller by at least a factor of order @xmath245 than the terms kept in the fokker - planck approximation . in this way",
    ", it is justified to introduce a cut - off of the form ( [ cut - off ] ) , with @xmath246 , which establishes the self - consistency of the scheme .",
    "the numerical computation shows that , indeed , the maximal lyapunov exponent is of the form ( [ rlyap1.l < a ] ) for @xmath144 , as seen in fig .",
    "the logarithmic correction turns out to be very small .",
    "we further observed that the second largest lyapunov exponent also scales as ( [ rlyap1.l < a ] ) .",
    "* remark : * the logarithmic divergences of the second moments of the distribution @xmath247 are an anomaly of the hard - ball potential",
    ". for smooth potentials these moments are well - defined .",

    "the temperature is always @xmath249 . in order to find the conditions under which the tracer particle dominates the lyapunov spectrum we proceed as follows .",
    "we notice that the limit @xmath104 is equivalent to the conditions @xmath114 and @xmath250 .",
    "therefore , we consider a sequence of systems of lower and lower density @xmath58 . in the limit @xmath251 ,",
    "three types of tracer disks are considered : @xmath252 the specific purpose of the last choice is to consider sequences of brownian particles of increasing sizes , but all made of the same material , so the ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath253 remains constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the maximal lyapunov exponent is plotted versus the density .    case ( i ) is the reference situation in which all disks are identical and we recover the pure fluid behavior ( [ fluidlyap ] ) , as expected .",
    "indeed , a best fit of the numerical data to a linear combination of @xmath254 and @xmath58 yields @xmath255 with the coefficient of the leading term in agreement with the value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ fluidlyap ] ) : @xmath256 .",
    "both cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) are examples of brownian motion , as both @xmath257 and @xmath0 are @xmath258 . in case ( ii )",

    "@xmath145 remains almost fixed at a value of 4/11 .",
    "the values of @xmath257 and @xmath0 chosen in case ( ii ) are such that the fluid always dominates the maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is clearly confirmed by the simulation results , which show that @xmath260 .    in case ( iii ) , in contrast , the tracer particle dominates the lyapunov spectrum at low densities as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . indeed , because @xmath261 , we infer from both eq .",

    "this explains the behavior observed in fig .",
    "we notice that case ( iii ) is intermediate between the two regimes , @xmath140 respectively @xmath198 studied in subsection [ rayleigh.dyn.inst ] , because the mean free path of the tracer is only slightly smaller than the tracer radius .",
    "indeed , in case ( iii ) we have @xmath264 .",
    "therefore neither ( [ rlyap1.l > a ] ) nor ( [ rlyap1.l < a ] ) strictly applies , but the scaling of the maximal lyapunov exponent as @xmath265 remains valid .",
    "however , with a system of one tracer disk among about 40 small disks , we are still in a situation very different from the rayleigh flight because of the periodic boundary conditions and the boundedness of the domain .",
    "even if the mean free path of the fluid particles among themselves is much larger than the size of the system @xmath266 the fluid particles have recollisions on the tracer particle because of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "when @xmath267 the dynamics of the fluid particles is dominated by recollisions with the tracer particle .",
    "we are then in a situation , similar to the sinai billiard in which a point particle ( such as a fluid particle ) collides on a large disk ( i.e. , the tracer particle ) in a system with periodic boundaries .",
    "this leads to two effects .",
    "the first effect is that , in the limit where the tracer particle is very massive , the fluid particles become almost independent of each other .",
    "therefore the lyapunov spectrum becomes similar to @xmath1 copies of the lyapunov spectrum @xmath268 of the sinai billiard . in the limit @xmath269",
    ", we should thus expect a lyapunov spectrum of the form @xmath270 in @xmath54 .",
    "this tendency is indeed observed in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] which compares two systems of different sizes with an identical tracer particle and at the same density .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that indeed the positive lyapunov exponents roughly separate into two equally populated families .",
    "this tendency is stronger for the 40-particle system than for the 80-particle one , as was to be expected in view of the preceding arguments . in the limit @xmath271",
    ", we notice that the lyapunov exponent of the sinai billiard vanishes as @xmath272 so that this effect tends to disappear .",
    "the second effect due to the periodic boundary conditions is more important for our present considerations than the previous one .",
    "if the recollisions of a fluid particle with the tracer particle become more frequent than collisions with other fluid particles these may have an important , or even dominant effect on the growth of the perturbations on the tracer coordinates . as a consequence ,",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent of the system may be different from the rayleigh - flight value even though the tracer particle dominates and controls it .",
    "this effect may even remove the gap in the lyapunov spectrum , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "notice that a small but finite density of large tracer particles will have exactly the same type of effects on the lyapunov spectrum of a large or even infinite system as periodic boundary conditions in the case of a single tracer particle .    in the limit where the system becomes infinite",
    ", we expect that both effects disappear and that a gap does appear in the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "this is indeed the case , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] showing the five largest lyapunov exponents for systems with the same density @xmath273 and temperature @xmath249 , the same tracer particle of radius @xmath274 and mass @xmath275 , but an increasing total size and so an increasing number @xmath1 of fluid particles . under these conditions",
    ", the limiting rayleigh flight would have the following two positive lyapunov exponents , obtained by monte - carlo simulation : @xmath276 for the full dynamics simulated by molecular dynamics , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] that the maximal lyapunov exponent decreases as @xmath277 to a value close to the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath278 of the rayleigh flight .",
    "the next exponents decrease faster , creating a gap in the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "we notice that , for the systems we studied , the second exponent has not yet converged to the rayleigh - flight value @xmath156 and is therefore not separated from the third and next exponents , but we expect this to occur for @xmath1 large enough .    in the rayleigh - flight limit , @xmath104 , combined with the large system limit @xmath277 , we therefore find a lyapunov spectrum that is dominated by the dynamical instability of the tracer particle : @xmath279 with the formation of a gap , as in the case of the lorentz - gas limit , but here because of a very different mechanism .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a system of hard balls in elastic collisions ( disks in @xmath54 and spheres in @xmath56 ) and we have shown that the tracer particle dominates the lyapunov spectrum in the lorentz - gas and in the rayleigh - flight limit .    in the lorentz - gas limit , the tracer particle is lighter and moves faster than the fluid particles .",
    "the tracer particle therefore has a higher collision frequency than the other particles .",
    "since the maximal lyapunov exponent is proportional to the collision frequency , a gap appears in the lyapunov spectrum between the largest lyapunov exponents , which are associated with the tracer particle , and the rest of the spectrum . in @xmath54 , there is one such positive lyapunov exponent associated with the tracer and , in @xmath56 , there are two such exponents .",
    "these largest lyapunov exponents take values very close to the lorentz - gas values previously obtained by van beijeren , dorfman , and latz @xcite , as confirmed by direct numerical computation .",
    "the other limit in which the tracer particle dominates the lyapunov spectrum is the rayleigh - flight limit . in this limit , the radius of the fluid particles tends to zero or , equivalently , the density of the fluid particles vanishes while the radius of the tracer is much larger than the radius of the fluid particles . in an infinite system",
    ", the only collisions would occur between the fluid particles and the lone tracer particle .",
    "we have shown the remarkable result that , even in this limit where the fluid is ideal and composed of non - interacting particles , the tracer particle may have positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "we obtained formulas for the dependence of the maximal lyapunov exponent on the parameters of the system in two different regimes .",
    "in the first regime , where the mean free path of the tracer particle is so much larger than its radius that perturbations of its coordinates are multiplied by large factors at almost all collisions , we find a behavior again very similar to that of the lorentz gas . in the other regime , where the effect of a single collision on average is very small , we found that the maximal lyapunov exponent scales as the product of the tracer particle collision frequency and the two - third power of the mass ratio @xmath280 , up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "these logarithmic corrections are special for the hard - ball potential and do not occur for more realistic interactions .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the positive lyapunov exponents determined by the tracer dynamics may dominate the lyapunov spectrum of the fully interacting system under conditions approaching the rayleigh - flight limit , provided the density of tracer particles , or alternatively the ratio between system size and tracer radius , remains finite .",
    "again , a gap appears in the lyapunov spectrum between the largest lyapunov exponents associated with the tracer particle and the rest of the spectrum .",
    "the different tracer - dominated regimes are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] as a function of the mass ratio @xmath0 and the radius ratio @xmath257 for two different densities of a two - dimensional fluid .",
    "the diagrams are qualitatively similar for a three - dimensional fluid .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows that the system is in a fluid - dominated regime if the tracer is very massive .",
    "nevertheless , we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig12]b that the tracer - dominated regimes extend toward larger masses at lower densities .",
    "a comment is here in order about brownian motion . in typical brownian motion conditions ,",
    "the tracer particle is much more massive than the fluid particles and , moreover , the mean free path of the fluid particles among themselves is much shorter than the radius of the brownian particle . under such conditions",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent of the full system usually is essentially the same as the fluid lyapunov exponent , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . then the brownian particle",
    "does not contribute significantly to the dynamical instability of the system and is a probe for the dynamics of the surrounding fluid .",
    "this is the case in typical brownian - motion experiments . in order to observe the new effect of dominance of the dynamical instability by the brownian",
