    "grs 1915 + 105 is being studied for almost ten years ( see , castro - tirado et al . 1994 ; mirabel & rodriguez , l.f . 1994 for early papers )",
    "quite extensively , and yet , it continues to reveal new physical insights into the phenomenon of black hole accretion .",
    "this enigmatic x - ray transient source exhibits at least twelve classes of light curves , if not more ( belloni et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these twelve types have been designated as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "these classes were based on the nature of the hardness ratios exhibited in the light curve . in some class ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) only hard x - rays",
    "are seen , in some other classes ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) only soft x - rays are seen , while in the majority ( such as @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath1 ) there were photons coming in the so - called ` burst - on ' and ` burst - off ' states which are similar to quick transitions between soft and hard states . subsequently , nandi , manickam & chakrabarti , ( 2000 ) rearranged these classes in a pattern more easily understandable by advective disk models ( see also : naik , rao & chakrabarti , 2002 ) .",
    "while rxte satellite has pointed to this object about a thousand times , it has not been able to pinpoint exactly how and when a class transition actually takes place .    in the present",
    "_ letter _ , we show that observations by the pointed proportional counters ( ppc ) in the ixae instrument aboard irs - p3 satellite , have revealed such class transitions several times .",
    "while the time - resolution and the number of energy bins of iaxe instrument are low , the observations nevertheless are good enough to identify the classes and the transitions .",
    "presently we report two such ` class - transitions ' from the archived data of ixae .",
    "we also show that the source probably had ` premonition ' about the class - transition about a few hundred seconds prior to the observation as is evidenced by the the presence of a drift in low - frequency ( lfqpo ) qpo in the power density spectrum ( pds ) .",
    "we observed light curves of ` unknown ' class just before the transition .",
    "we compare our results with rxte observations in nearby times .",
    "we present two transitions : one is @xmath12 transition on the june 22nd , 1997 and the other is @xmath13 transition on the june 25th , 1997 . in both the days , we find evidence of the lfqpo in the pre- and post - transition classes .",
    "while the exact cause of the class transition is not yet known , it has been pointed out by nandi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that this is due to the variation in accretion rates in both the keplerian and sub - keplerian components .",
    "they actually re - arranged the overall 12 classes of belloni ( 2000 ) into four major classes : hard class , soft class , semi - soft class and intermediate class and showed that the class transitions could be understood by slow variation of the accretion rate of the sub - keplerian component .",
    "chakrabarti & manickam ( 2000 ) , while explaining the correlation between the duration and qpo frequency in burst - off states of @xmath0 and @xmath6 classes , pointed out that the real cause of qpo is most probably the oscillations of the standing shocks .",
    "furthermore , the transition between the burst - off and burst - on states inside a class is most probably due to the cooling of the outflowing wind by soft - photons from the accretion disk . as a result",
    ", two qpo frequencies are expected in classes which have burst - on and burst - off states .",
    "the one at a high frequency ( around @xmath14hz or so ) would be due to the shock oscillation , while the one at low frequency ( say around @xmath15hz ) would be due to the quasi - periodic cooling of the outflows .",
    "if this is correct , then , it is possible that the basic nature of the quasi - periodic cooling of the outflow could continue to take place during a class transition , while the shock itself can be weakened .",
    "this would mean that the low frequency qpos could persist across class transitions .",
    "in the next section , we present results of our analysis and show that this is indeed the case .    in the next section ,",
    "we report the observations and show that such transitions actually took place on the same day in the data set from a single orbit .",
    "we perform fft at various times of observation and plot time - frequency diagram for observations in each orbit .",
    "we also compare our results with those of rxte ( which missed the transitions ) on the same date .",
    "finally , in  4 , we draw our conclusions .",
    "the indian x - ray astronomy experiment or ixae which was lunched from sriharikota range on march 21st , 1996 and since then has carried out observations till the year 2000 .",
    "it was flown on the indian satellite irs - p3 , had three identical pointed proportional counters ( ppcs ) ( agrawal , 1998 ) .",
    "each counter was filled with a gas mixture of @xmath16% argon and @xmath17% methane at a pressure of @xmath18 torr with a total effective area of @xmath19 .",
    "the operating energy range is between @xmath20 and @xmath21 kev with an average detection efficiency of @xmath22% at @xmath23kev .",
    "the counts are saved in the archive in two channels : in @xmath24kev and in @xmath25kev .",
    "although the time - resolution could be @xmath26s in medium mode , due to restrictions in data - storage on - board , usually observations have been carried out in @xmath27s resolution to have the data for five consecutive orbits per day .",
    "this is a great advantage which allowed one to observe class transitions at the cost of fast variability behaviour for which rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) is undoubtedly the champion .    in fig .",
    "1(a - e ) , we show the light curves ( upper panels ) and time - frequency diagrams ( lower panels ) obtained in five successive orbits on june 22nd , 1997 . the light curves were obtained by adding counts from all the three ppcs from both the energy channels @xmath24 and @xmath25kev .",
    "the lower panels were obtained by fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the photon counts in @xmath25kev . while in panel 1a , in the first orbit , the class is @xmath0 , in panel 1e , the class is @xmath1 . in between , the light curves do not appear to belong to any known class .",
    "the data has been analyzed by using ftools and xspec packages of nasa . since",
    "the time resolution of the observation is only @xmath27s , we are unable to identify the high - frequency qpos in ixae data",
    ". however , the lfqpos , in burst - on / burst - off sources , has been detected . for each panel of figs .",
    "1(a - e ) , we divide the data in segments of @xmath28s and stagger each segment by @xmath29 seconds . for each segment of @xmath28s",
    "we take the fast fourier transform ( fft ) and place the pds at its mean time .",
    "finally , we plot contours of constant normalized power @xmath30 as a function of the frequency and time of observation in each panel .",
    "the times of observations have been taken from table 1 of yadav et al .",
    "there is an error of 1 day in the date column in that table .",
    "this we have corrected .",
    "the observation started at 12:12:24 but fig .",
    "1a starts at 12:14:57 , @xmath31 seconds later , because of our choice of segment size .",
    "the observation ended at 19:20:50 while fig .",
    "1e ends at 19:18:17 , @xmath31 seconds earlier .",
    "there is no available record of the exact beginning and end times of each gap between orbits .",
    "two successive datasets are separated by @xmath32 minutes .",
    "thus , the exact time of the observation can not be given within 2 - 3 minutes of accuracy .",
    "only the duration is known with certainty . however",
    ", this does not affect out conclusions .    the contours in lower panel of fig .",
    "1a are drawn for normalized power @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( highest power is with darkest shade ) clearly indicating an lfqpo frequency @xmath4 oscillating between @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "1b , contours are drawn for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we note that in this unknown class the lfqpo frequency monotonically drifts from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "1c , the contours are drawn for @xmath42 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the drift of lfqpo frequency undergoes large amplitude fluctuation with high reaching up to @xmath43 . in fig .",
    "1d , which was drawn for @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , the first failed attempt of the class transition is seen after around @xmath46s of the time the begining of the observation where a large spike is seen in the light curve .",
    "the completely different power density spectra ( pds ) in the pre- and post - transition region produces a ` mixed ' pds in the transition region , causing large scale noise of duration @xmath47s , the size of our segments over which ffts were taken . in the result of the final orbit in fig .",
    "1e , the contours are drawn for @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "besides the noise generated by the transition region , it is clear that the lfqpo frequency at @xmath50 in the pre - transition ` unknown ' class continues to drift towards higher value [ @xmath51 as the light curve enters into the well known @xmath1 class .",
    "indeed , only @xmath52 minutes after this ixae observation ends , rxte observed grs 1915 + 105 for an hour ( obs .",
    "id=20402 - 01 - 34 - 01 ) between 19:27:28 to 20:27:04 and found the object in @xmath1 class with the same characteristics .",
    "there was an observation of rxte on the 18th of june , 1997 ( obs .",
    "i d = 20402 - 01 - 33 - 00 ) and the class observed was @xmath0 , same as the pre - transition class in ixae observation on the 22nd of june , 1997 ( fig .",
    "1a ) .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show another class transition on june 25th , 1997 . on this day also",
    "observations were carried out for five successive orbits .",
    "the first orbital observation begins at 11:12:15 and the fifth observation ends at 18:18:52 with gaps between the data of two successive orbits around @xmath53 minutes as before .",
    "we show only the results of the fourth orbit when actual transition took place .",
    "the light curve ( upper panel ) clearly shows a transition from @xmath2 to @xmath1 class . the time - frequency plot after fft of @xmath28s segments staggered by @xmath29s , shows ( lower panel ) the familiar noise in pds of duration @xmath47s .",
    "the class transition itself took place at around @xmath54s .",
    "the contours are drawn for @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "it is very clear that even from @xmath57s after the observation starts , the system started showing a lfqpo with frequency @xmath58 , while after transition , the lfqpo drifts towards @xmath59 .",
    "the first harmonics can also be observed at around @xmath60 . assuming the gaps between the orbits are of exactly equal duration",
    ", we estimate that this orbital observation ended at @xmath61 16:36:58 .    in this case",
    "also rxte has observed grs 1915 + 105 a few minutes after this observation , from 17:05:20 to 17:15:04 for a period of ten minutes ( obs .",
    "id=20402 - 01 - 34 - 00 ) .",
    "3 shows the light curve and the pds .",
    "the nature of the light curve matches with ixae observation and the pds shows a clear peak at @xmath62 with the first harmonics .",
    "it appears that the lfqpo frequency drifted a bit in the intervening half an hour .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have presented evidences of direct transition of grs 1915 + 105 going from one class of light curve to another class of light curve .",
    "three such occasions have been found in data obtained by ixae on june 22nd and 25th , 1997 .",
    "we find that every time such a transition takes place , the pds in the pre- and post - transition look very different and the intervening period is characterized by a noise ( induced due to mixing of these two types of pds results ) and in all the cases , the lfqpo frequency continues through the transition . on the 22nd of june , 2003 we found that an unknown class was sandwiched by the @xmath0 and @xmath1 class and",
    "a ` failed ' attempt was made for a class - transition about @xmath16 minutes prior to the actual transition . in both the dates we verified that our results are consistent with rxte observations also .",
    "indeed , rxte also observed on several occasions @xmath2 state followed by @xmath1 state ( e.g. obs ids 20402 - 01 - 27 - 01 & 20402 - 01 - 27 - 02 and 20402 - 01 - 29 - 00 & 20402 - 01 - 30 - 00 ; see , belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) as in our observation of 22nd june , 1997 , though exact transition time was not detected by rxte .",
