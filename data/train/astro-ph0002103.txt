    "astronomers today are more prolific than ever before .",
    "studies in publication trends in astronomy ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have hypothesized that the current explosion in published papers in astronomy is due to a combination of factors : growth in professional society membership , an increase in papers by multiple authors , the launching of new spacecrafts , and increased competition for jobs and pis in the field ( since candidate evaluation is partially based on publication history ) .",
    "as the number of papers in the field grows , so does the need for tools which astronomers can use to locate that fraction of papers which pertain to their specific interests .",
    "the ads abstract service is one of several bibliographic services which provide this function for astronomy , but due to the broad scope of our coverage and the simplicity of access to our data , astronomers now rely extensively on the ads , and other bibliographic services not only link to us , but some have built their bibliographic search capabilities on top of the ads system .",
    "the international society for optical engineering ( spie ) and the nasa technical report service ( ntrs ) are two such services .",
    "the evolution of the astrophysics data system ( ads ) has been largely data - driven .",
    "our search tools and indexing routines have been modified to maximize speed and efficiency based on the content of our dataset . as new types of data ( such as electronic versions of articles ) became available ,",
    "the abstract service quickly incorporated that new feature .",
    "the organization and standardization of the database content is the very core upon which the abstract service has been built .",
    "this paper contains a description of the ads abstract service from a  data \" point of view , specifically descriptions of our holdings and of the processes by which we ingest new data into the system .",
    "details are provided on the organization of the databases ( section [ databases ] ) , the description of the data in the databases ( section [ data ] ) , the creation of bibliographic records ( section [ creating ] ) , the procedures for updating the database ( section [ updating ] ) , and on the scanned articles in the astronomy database ( section [ articles ] ) .",
    "we discuss the interaction between the ads and the journal publishers ( section [ journals ] ) and analyze some of the numbers corresponding to the datasets ( section [ summary ] ) . in conjunction with three other ads papers in this volume , this paper is intended to offer details on the entire abstract service with the hopes that astronomers will have a better understanding of the reference data upon which they rely for their research . in addition , we hope that researchers in other disciplines may be able to benefit from some of the details described herein .    as is often the case with descriptions of active internet resources , what follows is a description of the present situation with the ads abstract service .",
    "new features are always being added , some of which necessitate changes in our current procedures .",
    "furthermore , with the growth of electronic publishing , some of our core ideas about bibliographic tools and requirements must be reconsidered in order to be able to take full advantage of new publishing technologies for a new millennium .",
    "the ads abstract service was originally conceived of in the mid 1980 s as a way to provide on - line access to bibliographies of astronomers which were previously available only through expensive librarian search services or through the a&a abstracts series ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , published by the astronomisches rechen - institut in heidelberg . while the ideas behind the abstract service search engine were being developed ( see @xcite , hereafter overview ) , concurrent efforts were underway to acquire a reliable data source on which to build the server . in order to best develop the logistics of the search engine it was necessary to have access to real literature data from the past and present , and to set up a mechanism for acquiring data in the future .",
    "an electronic publishing meeting in the spring of 1991 brought together a number of organizations whose ultimate cooperation would be necessary to make the system a reality ( see overview for details ) .",
    "nasa s scientific and technical information program ( sti ) offered to provide abstracts to the ads .",
    "sti s abstracts were a rewritten version of the original abstracts , categorized and keyworded by professional editors .",
    "they not only abstracted the astronomical literature , but many other scientific disciplines as well .",
    "with sti agreeable to providing the past and present literature , and the journals committed to providing the future literature , the data behind the system fell into place .",
    "the termination of the journal abstracting by the sti project several years later was unfortunate , but did not cause the collapse of the ads abstract service because of the commitment of the journal publishers to distribute their information freely .",
    "the sti abstracting approximately covered the period from 1975 to 1995 . with the sti data alone , we estimated the completeness of the astronomy database to be better than 90% for the core astronomical journals . fortunately , with the additional data supplied by the journals , by simbad ( set of identifications , measurements , and bibliographies for astronomical data , @xcite ) at the cds ( centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ) , and by performing optical character recognition ( ocr ) on the scanned table of contents ( see section [ articles ] below ) , we are now closer to 99% complete for that period . in the period since",
    "then we are 100% complete for those journals which provide us with data , and significantly less complete for those which do not ( e.g. many observatory publications and non - u.s . journals ) .",
    "the data prior to 1975 are also significantly incomplete , although we are currently working to improve the completeness of the early data , primarily through scanning the table of contents for journal volumes as they are placed on - line .",
    "we are 100% complete for any journal volume which we have scanned and put on - line , since we verify that we have all bibliographic entries during the procedure of putting scans on - line .",
    "since the sti data were divided into categories , it was easy to create additional databases with non - astronomical data which were still of interest to astronomers .",
    "the creation of an instrumentation database has enabled us to provide a database for literature related to astronomical instrumentation , of particular interest to those scientists building astronomical telescopes and satellite instruments .",
    "we were fortunate to get the cooperation of the spie very quickly after releasing the instrumentation database .",
    "spie has become our major source of abstracts for the instrumentation database now that sti no longer supplies us with data .",
    "our physics and geophysics database , the third database to go on - line , is intended for scientists working in physics - related fields .",
    "we add authors and titles from all of the physics journals of the american institute of physics ( aip ) , the institute of physics ( iop ) , and the american physical society ( aps ) , as well as many physics journals from publishers such as elsevier and academic press ( ap ( ap ) ) .",
    "the fourth database in the system , the preprint database , contains a subset of the los alamos national laboratory s ( lanl ) preprint archive ( @xcite ) .",
    "our database includes the lanl astro - ph preprints which are retrieved from lanl and indexed nightly through an automated procedure .",
    "that dataset includes preprints from astronomical journals submitted directly by authors .",
    "the original set of data from sti contained several basic fields of data ( author , title , keywords , and abstracts ) to be indexed and made available for searching .",
    "all records were keyed on sti s accession number , a nine - digit code consisting of a letter prefix ( a or n ) followed by a two - digit publication year , followed by a five - letter identifier ( e.g. a95 - 12345 ) .",
    "data were stored in files named by accession number .    with the inclusion of data from other sources , primarily the journal publishers and simbad , we extended sti s concept of the accession number to handle other abstracts as well .",
    "since the ads may receive the same abstract from multiple sources , we originally adopted a system of using a different prefix letter with the remainder of the accession number being the same to describe abstracts received from different sources .",
    "thus , the same abstract for the above accession number from sti would be listed as j95 - 12345 from the journal publisher and s95 - 12345 from simbad .",
    "this allowed the indexing routines to consider only one instance of the record when indexing .",
    "recently , limitations in the format of accession numbers and the desire to index data from multiple sources ( rather than just sti s version ) have prompted us to move to a data storage system based entirely on the bibliographic code .",
    "the concept of a unique bibliographic code used to identify an article was originally conceived of by simbad and ned ( nasa s extragalactic database , @xcite ) .",
    "the original specification is detailed in @xcite . in the years since , the ads has adopted and expanded their definition to be able to describe references outside of the scope of those projects .    the bibliographic code is a 19-character string comprised of several fields which usually enables a user to identify the full reference from that string .",
    "it is defined as follows :    * yyyyjjjjjvvvvmppppa *    where the fields are defined in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "7.0inlll    field & definition & example     + yyyy & publication year & 1997 + jjjjj & journal abbreviation & apj , a&a , mnras , etc .",
    "+ vvvv & volume number & 480 + m & qualifier for publication & l ( for letter ) , p ( for pink page ) + & & q , r , s , etc . for unduplicating + & & a , b , c , etc .",
    "for issue number + pppp & page number & 129 + a & first letter of the first author s surname & n +   +    the journal field is left - justified and the volume and page fields are right - justified .",
    "blank spaces and leading zeroes are replaced by periods . for articles with page numbers greater than 9999",
    ", the m field contains the first digit of the page number .",
    "the a field contains a colon (  : \" ) if there is no author listed .",
    "creating bibliographic codes for the astronomical journals is uncontroversial .",
    "each journal typically has a commonly - used abbreviation , and the volume and page are easily assigned ( e.g. 1999pasp .. 111 .. 438f ) . each volume tends to have individual page numbering , and in those cases where more than one article appears on a page ( such as errata ) , a  q\",r\",s \" , etc .",
    "is used as the qualifier for publication to make bibliographic codes unique .",
    "when page numbering is not continuous across issue numbers ( such as sky & telescope ) , the issue number is represented by a lower case letter as the qualifier for publication ( e.g.  a \" for issue 1 ) .",
    "this is because there may be multiple articles in a volume starting on the same page number .    creating bibliographic codes for the  grey \" literature such as conference proceedings and technical reports is a more difficult task",
    ". the expansion into these additional types of data included in the ads required us to modify the original prototype bibliographic code definition in order to present identifiers which are easily recognizable to the user .",
    "the prototype definition of the bibliographic code suggested using a single letter in the second place of the volume field to identify non - standard references ( catalogs , phd theses , reports , preprints , etc . ) and using the third and fourth place of that field to unduplicate and report volume numbers ( e.g. 1981crjs ..",
    "14w ) . since we felt that this created codes unidentifiable to the typical user and since ned and simbad did not feel that users needed to be able to identify books directly from their bibliographic codes , the ads adopted different rules for creating codes to identify the grey literature .",
    "it is straightforward to create bibliographic codes for conference proceedings which are part of a series .",
    "for example , the iau symposia series ( iaus ) contains volume numbers and therefore fits the journal model for bibliographic codes .",
    "other conference proceedings , books , colloquia , and reports in the ads typically contain a four letter word in the volume field such as  conf \" ,  proc \" ,  book \" ,  coll \" , or ",
    "when this is the case with a bibliographic code , the journal field typically consists of the first letter from important words in the title .",
    "this can give the user the ability to identify a conference proceeding at a glance ( e.g.  ioda.book \" for  information and on - line data in astronomy \" ) .",
    "we will often leave the fifth place of the journal field as a dot for  readability \" ( e.g. 1995ioda.book..175m ) . for most proceedings which are also published as part of a series ( e.g. asp conference series , iau colloquia , aip conference series )",
    ", we include in the system two bibliographic codes , one as described above and one which contains the series name and the volume ( see section [ masterlist ] ) .",
    "we do this so that users can see , for example , that a paper published in one of the  astronomical data analysis software and systems \" series is clearly labelled as  adass \" whereas a typical user might not remember which volume of aspc contained those adass papers .",
    "this increases the user s readability of bibliographic codes .    with the sti data , the details were often unclear as to whether an article was from a conference proceeding , a meeting , a colloquium , etc .",
    "we assigned those codes as best we could , making no significant distinction between them . for conference abstracts submitted by the editors of a proceedings prior to publication",
    ", we often do not have page numbers . in this case",
    ", we use a counter in lieu of a page number and use an  e \" ( for  electronic \" ) in the fourteenth column , the qualifier for publication .",
    "if these conference abstracts are then published , their bibliographic codes are replaced by a bibliographic code complete with page number .",
    "if the conference abstracts are published only on - line , they retain their electronic bibliographic code with its e and counter number .",
    "there are several other instances of datasets where the bibliographic codes are non - standard .",
    "phd theses in the system use  phdt \" as the journal abbreviation , contain no volume number , and contain a counter in lieu of a page number . since phd theses , like all bibliographic codes , are unique across all of the databases , the counter makes the bibliographic code an identifier for only one thesis .",
    "iau circulars also use a counter instead of a page number .",
    "current circulars are electronic in form , and although not technically a new page , the second item of an iau circular is the electronic equivalent of a second page . using the page number as a counter enables us to minimize use of the m identifier in the fourteenth place of a bibliographic code for unduplicating .",
    "this is desirable since codes containing those identifiers are essentially impossible to create a priori , either by the journals or by users .",
    "the last set of data currently included in the ads which contain non - standard bibliographic codes is the  qb \" book entries from the library of congress .",
    "qb is the library of congress code for astronomy - related books and we have put approximately 17,000 of these references in the system . because the qb numbers are identifiers by themselves , we have made an exception to the bibliographic code format to use the qb number ( complete with any series or part numbers ) , prepended with the publication year as the bibliographic code .",
    "such an entry is easily identifiable as a book , and these codes enable users to locate the books in most libraries .",
    "it is worth noting that while the bibliographic code makes identification simple for the vast majority of references in the system , we are aware of two instances where the bibliographic definition breaks down .",
    "the use of the fourteenth column for a qualifier such as  l \" for _ apj letters _ makes it impossible to use that column for unduplicating .",
    "therefore , if there are two errata on the same page with the same author initial , there is no way to create unique bibliographic codes for them .",
    "we are aware of only one such instance in the 33 years of publication of _ apj letters_. second , with the electronic publishing of an increasing number of journals , the requirement of page numbers to locate articles becomes unnecessary .",
    "the journal _ physical review d _ is currently using 6-digit article identifiers as page numbers . since the bibliographic code allows for page numbers not longer than 5 digits",
    ", we are currently converting these 6-digit identifiers to their 5-digit hexagesimal equivalent .",
    "both of these anomalies indicate that over the next few years we will likely need to alter the current bibliographic definition in order to allow consistent identification of articles for all journals .",
    "the databases are set up such that some data fields are searchable and others are not .",
    "the searchable fields ( title , author , and text ) are the bulk of the important data , and these fields are indexed so that a query to the database returns the maximum number of meaningful results .",
    "( see @xcite , hereafter architecture ) .",
    "the text field is the union of the abstract , title , keywords , and comments .",
    "thus , if a user requests a particular word in the text field , all papers are returned which contain that word in the abstract * or * in the title * or * in the keywords * or * in the comments .",
    "appendix a shows version 1.0 of the extensible markup language ( xml , see [ dataformats ] ) document type definition ( dtd ) for text files in the ads abstract service .",
    "the dtd lists fields currently used or expected to be used in text files in the ads ( see section [ textfiles ] for details on the text files ) . we intend to reprocess the current journal and affiliation fields in order to extract some of these fields .    since sti ceased abstracting the journal literature , we decided to make the keywords themselves no longer a searchable entity for the time being  they are searchable only through the abstract text field .",
    "sti used a different standard set of keywords from the aas journals , who use a different set of keywords from aip journals ( e.g. _ aj _ prior to 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , keywords from a single journal such as the _ astrophysical journal ( apj ) _ have evolved over the years so that early _",
    "volume keywords are not consistent with later volumes . in order to build one coherent set of keywords ,",
    "an equivalence or synonym table for these different keyword sets must be created .",
    "we are investigating different schemes for doing this , and currently plan to have a searchable keyword field again , which encompasses all keywords in the system and equates those from different keyword systems which are similar ( @xcite ) .",
    "the current non - searchable fields in the ads databases include the journal field , author affiliation , category , abstract copyright , and abstract origin .",
    "although we may decide to create an index and search interface for some of these entities ( such as category ) , others will continue to remain unsearchable since searching them is not useful to the typical user .",
    "in particular , author affiliations would be useful to search , however this information is inconsistently formatted so it is virtually impossible to collect all variations of a given institution for indexing coherently .",
    "furthermore , we have the author affiliations for only about half of the entries in the astronomy database so we have decided to keep this field non - searchable . for researchers wishing to analyze affiliations on a large scale",
    ", we can provide this information on a collaborative basis .",
    "the ads currently receives abstracts or table of contents ( toc ) references from almost two hundred journal sources .",
    "tables  [ table2 ] , [ table3 ] , and [ table4 ] list these journals , along with their bibliographic code abbreviation , source , frequency with which we receive the data , what data are received , and any links we can create to the data . toc references typically contain only author and title , although sometimes keywords are included as well . the data are contributed via email , ftp , or retrieved from web sites around the world at a frequency ranging from once a week to approximately once a year . the term  often \" used in the frequency column implies that we get them more frequently than once a month , but not necessarily on a regular basis .",

    "recent enhancements to the indexing software have enabled us to perform instantaneous updates , triggered by an email containing new data ( see architecture ) .",
    "updates to the physics database occurs approximately once every two months . as stated earlier , the preprint database is updated nightly .",
    "the ads is able to benefit from certain standards which are adhered to in the writing and submission practices of astronomical literature .",
    "the journals share common abbreviations and text formatting routines which are used by the astronomers as well . the use of tex ( @xcite ) and latex ( @xcite ) , and their extension to bibtex ( @xcite ) and aastex ( @xcite ) results in common formats among some of our data sources .",
    "this enables the reuse of parsing routines to convert these formats to our standard format",
    ". other variations of tex used by journal publishers also allows us to use common parsing routines which greatly facilitates data loading .",
    "tex is a public domain typesetting program designed especially for math and science .",
    "it is a markup system , which means that formatting commands are interspersed with the text in the tex input file .",
    "in addition to commands for formatting ordinary text , tex includes many special symbols and commands with which you can format mathematical formulae with both ease and precision . because of its extraordinary capabilities",
    ", tex has become the leading typesetting system for science , mathematics , and engineering .",
    "it was developed by donald knuth at stanford university .",
    "latex is a simplified document preparation system built on tex . because latex is available for just about any type of computer and because latex files are ascii , scientists are able to send their papers electronically to colleagues around the world in the form of latex input .",
    "this is also true for other variants of tex , although the astronomical publishing community has largely centered their publishing standards on latex or one of the software packages based on latex , such as bibtex or aastex .",
    "bibtex is a program and file format designed by oren patashnik and leslie lamport in 1985 for the latex document preparation system , and aastex is a latex - based package that can be used to mark up manuscripts specifically for american astronomical society ( aas ) journals .",
    "similar to the widespread acceptance of tex and its variants , the extensive use of sgml ( standard generalized markup language , @xcite ) by the members of the publishing community has given us the ability to standardize many of our parsing routines .",
    "all data gleaned off the world wide web share features due to the use of html ( hypertext markup language , @xcite ) , an example of sgml . furthermore , the trend towards using xml ( extensible markup language , @xcite ) to describe text documents will enable us to share standard document attributes with other members of the astronomical community .",
    "xml is a subset of sgml which is intended to enable generic sgml to be served , received , and processed on the web in the way that is now possible with html .",
    "the ads parsing routines benefit from these standards in several ways : we can reuse routines designed around these systems ; we are able to preserve original text representations of entities such as embedded accents so these entities are displayed correctly in the user s browser ; and we are able to capture value - added features such as electronic urls and email addresses for use elsewhere in our system .    in order to facilitate data exchange between different parts of the ads , we make use of a tagged format similar to the  refer \" format ( @xcite ) .",
    "refer is a preprocessor for the word processors nroff and troff which finds and formats references . while our tagged formats share some common fields ( % a , % t , % j , % d ) , the refer format is not specific enough to be used for our purposes .",
    "items such as objects , urls and copyright notices are beyond the scope of the refer syntax .",
    "details on our tagged format are provided in table  [ table5 ] .",
    "reading and writing routines for this format are shared by loading and indexing routines , and a number of our data sources submit abstracts to us in this format .",

    "one of the basic principles in the parsing and formatting of the bibliographic data incorporated into the ads database over the years has been to preserve as much of the original information as possible and delay any syntactic or semantic interpretation of the data until a later stage . from the implementation point of view",
    ", this means that bibliographic records provided to the ads by publishers or other data sources typically are saved as files which are tagged with their origin , entry date , and any other ancillary information relevant to their contents ( e.g. if the fields in the record contain data which was transliterated or converted to ascii ) .",
    "for instance , the records provided to the ads by the university of chicago press ( the publisher of several major u.s .",
    "astronomical journals ) are sgml documents which contain a unique manuscript identifier assigned to the paper during the electronic publishing process .",
    "this identifier is saved in the file created by the ads system for this bibliographic entry .",
    "because data about a particular bibliographic entry may be provided to the ads by different sources and at different times , we adopted a multi - step procedure in the creation and management of bibliographic records :    \\1 ) tokenization : parsing input data into a memory - resident data structure using procedures which are format- and source - specific .",
    "\\2 ) identification : computing the unique bibliographic record identifier used by the ads to refer to this record .",
    "\\3 ) instantiation : creating a new record for each bibliography formatted according to the ads  standard \" format .",
    "\\4 ) extraction : selecting the best information from the different records available for the same bibliography and merging them into a single entry , avoiding duplication of redundant information .",
    "the activity of parsing a ( possibly ) loosely - structured bibliographic record is typically more of an art than a science , given the wide range of possible formats used by people for the representation and display of these records .",
    "the ads uses the perl language ( practical extraction and report language , @xcite ) for implementing most of the routines associated with handling the data .",
    "perl is an interpreted programming language optimized for scanning and processing textual data .",
    "it was chosen over other programming languages because of its speed and flexibility in handling text strings .",
    "features such as pattern matching and regular expression substitution greatly facilitate manipulating the data fields . to maximize flexibility in the parsing and formatting operations of different fields , we have written a set of perl library modules and scripts capable of performing a few common tasks .",
    "some that we consider worth mentioning from the methodological point of view are listed below .    *",
    "character set conversion : electronic data are often delivered to us in different character set encodings , requiring translation of the data stream in one of the standard character sets expected by our input scripts .",
    "the default character set that has been used by the ads until recently is `` latin-1 '' encoding ( iso-8859 - 1 , @xcite ) .",
    "we are now in the process of converting to the use of unicode characters ( @xcite ) encoded in utf-8 ( ucs transformation format , 8bit form ) .",
    "the advantage of using unicode is its universality ( all character sets can be mapped to unicode without loss of information ) .",
    "the advantage of adopting utf-8 over other encodings is mainly the software support currently available ( most of the modern software packages can already handle utf-8 internally ) .",
    "the adoption of unicode and utf-8 also works well with our adoption of xml as the standard format for bibliographic data . *",
    "macro and entity expansion : several of the highly structured document formats in use today rely on the strengths of the formatting language for the specification of some common formatting tasks or data tokens . typically this means that latex documents that are supplied to us make use of one or more macro packages to perform some of the formatting tasks .",
    "similarly , sgml documents will conform to some document type definition ( dtd ) provided to us by the publisher , and will make use of some standard set of sgml entities to encode the document at the required level of abstraction .",
    "what this means for us is that even if most of the input data comes to us in one of two basic formats ( tex / latex / bibtex or sgml / html / xml ) , we must be able to parse a large number of document classes , each one defined by a different and ever increasing set of specifications , be it a macro package or a dtd . *",
    "author name formatting : special care has been taken in parsing and formatting author names from a variety of possible input formats to the standard one used by the ads .",
    "the proper handling of author names is crucial to the integrity of the data in the ads . without proper author handling",
    ", users would be unable to get complete listings on searches by author names which comprise approximately two - thirds of all searches ( see @xcite , hereafter search ) .",
    "+ since the majority of our data sources do not provide author names in our standard format ( last name , first name or initial ) , our loading routines need to be able to invert author names accurately , handling cases such as multiple word last names ( da costa , van der bout , little marenin ) and suffixes ( jr . , sr .",
    "any titles in an author s name ( dr .",
    ", rev . ) were previously omitted , but are now being retained in the new xml formatting of text files .",
    "+ the assessment of what constitutes a multiple word last name as opposed to a middle name is non - trivial since some names , such as davis , can be a first name ( davis hartman ) , a middle name ( a. g. davis philip ) , a last name ( robert davis ) , or some combination ( davis s. davis ) .",
    "another example is how to determine when the name  van \" is a first name ( van nguyen ) , a middle name ( w. van dyke dixon ) , or part of a last name ( j. van allen ) .",
    "handling all of these cases correctly requires not only familiarity with naming conventions worldwide , but an intimate familiarity with the names of astronomers who publish in the field .",
    "we are continually amassing the latter as we incorporate increasing amounts of data into the system , and as we get feedback from our users .",
    "* spell checking : since many of the historical records entered in the ads have been generated by typesetting tables of contents , typographical errors can often be flagged in an automated way using spell - checking software .",
    "we have developed a perl software driver for the international ispell program , a unix utility , which can be used as a spell - checking filter on all input to be considered textual information . a custom dictionary containing terms specific to astronomy and space sciences",
    "is used to increase the recognition capabilities of the software module .",
    "any corrections suggested by the spell - checker module are reviewed by a human before the data are actually updated . *",
    "language recognition : extending the capability of the spell - checker , we have implemented a software module which attempts to guess the language of an input text buffer based on the percentage of words that it can recognize in one of several languages : english , german , french , spanish , or italian . this module is used to flag records to be entered in our database in a language other than english .",
    "knowledge of the language of an abstract allows us to create accurate synonyms for those words ( see architecture ) .",
    "we call identification the activity of mapping the tokens extracted from the parsing of a bibliographic record into a unique identifier .",
    "the ads adopted the use of bibliographic codes as the identifier for bibliographic entries shortly after its inception , in order to facilitate communication between the ads and simbad .",
    "the advantage of using bibliographic codes as unique identifiers is that they can most often be created in a straightforward way from the information given in the list of references published in the astronomical literature , namely the publication year , journal name , volume , and page numbers , and first author s name ( see section [ bibcodes ] for details ) .      ",
    "instantiation \" of a bibliographic entry consists of the creation of a record for it in the ads database .",
    "the ads must handle receipt of the same data from multiple sources .",
    "we have created a hierarchy of data sources so that we always know the preferred data source . a reference for which we have received records from sti",
    ", the journal publisher , simbad , and ned , for example , must be in the system only once with the best information from each source preserved .",
    "when we load a reference into the system , we check whether a text file already exists for that reference .",
    "if there is no text file , it is a new reference and a text file is created .",
    "if there already is a text file , we append the new information to the current text file , creating a  merged \" text file .",
    "this merged text file lists every instance of every field that we have received .      by  extraction \" of a bibliographic entry we mean",
    "the procedure used to create a unique representation of the bibliography from the available records .",
    "this is essentially an activity of data fusion and unification , which removes redundancies in the bibliographic records obtained by the ads and properly labels fields by their characteristics .",
    "the extraction algorithm has been designed with our prior experience as to the quality of the data to select the best fields from each data source , to cross - correlate the fields as necessary , and to create a  canonical \" text file which contains a unique instance of each field . since the latter",
    "is created through software , only one version of the text file must be maintained ; when the merged text file is appended , the canonical text file is automatically recreated .",
    "the extraction routine selects the best pieces of information from each source and combines them into one reference which is more complete than the individual references .",
    "for example , author lists received from sti were often truncated after five or ten authors .",
    "whenever we have a longer author list from another source , that author list is used instead .",
    "this not only recaptures missing authors , it also provides full author names instead of author initials whenever possible .",
    "in addition , our journal sources sometimes omit the last page number of the reference , but simbad usually includes it , so we are able to preserve this information in our canonical text file .",
    "some fields need to be labelled by their characteristics so that they are properly indexed and displayed .",
    "the keywords , for example , need to be attributed to a specific keyword system .",
    "the system designation allows for multiple keyword sets to be displayed ( e.g. nasa / sti keywords and aas keywords ) and will be used in the keyword synonym table currently under development ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also attempt to cross - correlate authors with their affiliations wherever possible .",
    "this is necessary for records where the preferred author field is from one source and the affiliations are from another source .",
    "we attempt to assign the proper affiliation based on the last name and do not assume that the author order is accurate since we are aware of ordering discrepancies in some of the sti records .    through these four steps in the procedure of creating and managing bibliographic records ,",
    "we are able to take advantage of receiving the same reference from multiple sources .",
    "we standardize the various records and present to the user a combination of the most reliable fields from each data source in one succinct text file .",
    "the software to update bibliographic records in the database consists of a series of perl scripts , typically one per data source , which reads in the data , performs any special processing particular to that data source , and writes out the data to text files .",
    "the loading routines perform three fundamental tasks : 1 ) they add new bibliographic codes to the current master list of bibliographic codes in the system ; 2 ) they create and organize the text files containing the reference data ; and 3 ) they maintain the lists of bibliographic codes used to indicate what items are available for a given reference .      the master list is a table containing bibliographic codes together with their publication dates ( yyyymm ) and entry dates into the system ( yyyymmdd ) .",
    "there is one master list per database with one line per reference .",
    "the most important aspect of the master list is that it retains information about  alternative \" bibliographic codes and matches them to their corresponding preferred bibliographic code .",
    "an alternative bibliographic code is usually a reference which we receive from another source ( primarily simbad or ned ) which has been assigned a different bibliographic code from the one used by the ads .",
    "sometimes this is due to the different rules used to build bibliographic codes for non - standard publications ( see section [ bibcodes ] ) , but often it is just an incorrect year , volume , page , or author initial in one of the databases ( simbad or ned or the ads ) . in either case , the ads must keep the alternative bibliographic code in the system so that it can be found when referenced by the other source ( e.g. when simbad sends back a list of their codes related to an object ) .",
    "the ads matches the alternative bibliographic code to our corresponding one and replaces any instances of the alternative code when referenced by the other data source .",
    "alternative bibliographic codes in the master list are prepended with an identification letter ( s for simbad , n for ned , j for journal ) so that their origin is retained .    while we make every effort to propagate corrections back to our data sources ,",
    "sometimes there is simply a valid discrepancy .",
    "for example , alternative bibliographic codes are often different from the ads bibliographic code due to ambiguous differences such as which name is the surname of a chinese author . since americans tend to invert chinese names one way ( zheng , wei ) and europeans another ( wei , zheng ) , this results in two different , but equally valid codes .",
    "similarly , discrepancies in journal names such as baas ( for the published abstracts in the _ bulletin of the american astronomical society _ ) and aas ( for the equivalent abstract with meeting and session number , but no volume or page number ) need different codes to refer to the same paper .",
    "russian and chinese translation journals ( _ astronomicheskii zhurnal",
    "_ vs. _ soviet astronomy _ and _ acta astronomica sinica _ vs. _ chinese astronomy and astrophysics _ ) share the same problem .",
    "these papers appear once in the foreign journal and once in the translation journal ( usually with different page numbers ) , but are actually the same paper which should be in the system only once .",
    "the ads must therefore maintain multiple bibliographic codes for the same article since each journal has its own abbreviation , and queries for either one must be able to be recognized .",
    "the master list is the source of this correlation and enables the indexing procedures and search engine to recognize alternative bibliographic codes .",
    "text files in the ads are stored in a directory tree by bibliographic code .",
    "the top level of directories is divided into directories with four - digit names by publication year ( characters 1 through 4 of the bibliographic code ) .",
    "the next level contains directories with five - character names according to journal ( characters 5 through 9 ) , and the text files are named by full bibliographic code under these journal directories .",
    "thus , a sample pathname is 1998/mnras/1998mnras.295 ... 75e .",
    "alternative bibliographic codes do not have a text file named by that code , since the translation to the equivalent preferred bibliographic code is done prior to accessing the text file .",
    "a sample text file is given in the appendices .",
    "appendix b shows the full bibliographic entry , including all records as received from sti , _ mnras _ , and simbad .",
    "it contains xml - tagged fields from each source , showing all instances of every field .",
    "appendix c shows the extracted canonical version of the bibliographic entry which contains only selected information from the merged text file .",
    "this latter version is displayed to the user through the user interface ( see search ) .",
    "the third basic function of the loading procedures is to modify and maintain the listings for available items .",
    "the ads displays the availability of resources or information related to bibliographic entries as letter codes in the results list of queries and as more descriptive hyperlinks in the page displaying the full information available for a bibliographic entry .",
    "a full listing of the available item codes and their meaning is given in search .",
    "the loading routines maintain lists of bibliographic codes for each letter code in the system which are converted to urls by the indexing routines ( see architecture ) .",
    "bibliographic codes are appended to the lists either during the loading process or as post - processing work depending on the availability of the resource .",
    "when electronic availability of data coincides with our receipt of the data , the bibliographic codes can be appended to the lists by the loading procedures .",
    "when we receive the data prior to electronic availability , post - processing routines must be run to update the bibliographic code lists after we are notified that we may activate the links .",
    "the ads is able to scan and provide free access to past issues of the astronomical journals because of the willing collaboration of the journal publishers .",
    "the primary reason that the journal publishers have agreed to allow the scanning of their old volumes is that the loss of individual subscriptions does not pose a threat to their livelihood . unlike many disciplines , most astronomy journals are able to pay for their publications through the cost of page charges to astronomers who write the articles and through library subscriptions which are unlikely to be cancelled in spite of free access to older volumes through the ads . the journal publishers continue to charge for access to the current volumes , which is paid for by most institutional libraries .",
    "this arrangement places astronomers in a fortunate position for electronic accessibility of astronomy articles .",
    "the original electronic publishing plans for the astronomical community called for stelar ( study of electronic literature for astronomical research , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to handle the scanning and dissemination of the full journal articles . however , when the stelar project was terminated in 1993 , the ads assumed responsibility for providing scanned full journal articles to the astronomical community .",
    "the first test journal to be scanned was the _",
    "apj letters _ which was scanned in january , 1995 at 300 dots per inch ( dpi ) .",
    "it should be noted that those scans were intended to be 600 dpi and we will soon rescan them at the higher 600 dpi resolution .",
    "complications in the journal publishing format ( plates at the end of some volumes and in the middle of others ) were noted and detailed instructions provided to the scanning company so that the resulting scans would be named properly by page or plate number .",
    "all of the scans since the original test batch have been scanned at 600 dpi using a high speed scanner and generating a 1 bit / pixel monochrome image for each page .",
    "the files created are then automatically processed in order to de - skew and center the text in each page , resize images to a standard u.s .",
    "letter size ( 8.5 x 11 inches ) , and add a copyright notice at the bottom of each page . for each original scanned page , two separate image files of different resolutions are generated and stored on disk .",
    "the availability of different resolutions allows users the flexibility of downloading either high or medium quality documents , depending on the speed of their internet connection .",
    "the image formats and compression used were chosen based on the available compression algorithms and browser capabilities .",
    "the high resolution files currently used are 600 dpi , 1 bit / pixel tiff ( tagged image file format ) files , compressed using the ccitt group 4 facsimile encoding algorithm .",
    "the medium resolution files are 200 dpi , 1 bit / pixel tiff files , also with ccitt group 4 facsimile compression .",
    "conversion to printing formats ( pdf , pcl , and postscript ) is done on demand , as requested by the user . similarly ,",
    "conversion from the tiff files to a low resolution gif ( graphic interchange format ) file ( 75 , 100 , or 150 dpi , depending on user preferences ) for viewing on the computer screen is done on demand , then cached so that the most frequently accessed pages do not need to be created every time .",
    "a procedure run nightly deletes the gif files with the oldest access time stamp so that the total size of the disk cache is kept under a pre - defined limit .",
    "the current 10 gbytes of cache size in use at the sao article server causes only files which have not been accessed for about a month to be deleted . like the full - screen gif images , the ads also caches thumbnail images of the article pages which provide users with the capability of viewing the entire article at a glance .",
    "the ads uses optical character recognition ( ocr ) software to gain additional data from tiff files of article scans .",
    "the ocr software is not yet adequate for accurate reproduction of the scanned pages .",
    "greek symbols , equations , charts , and tables do not translate accurately enough to remain true to the original printed page . for this reason , we have chosen not to display to the user anything rendered by the ocr software in an unsupervised fashion .",
    "however , we are still able to take advantage of the ocr software for several purposes .    first , we are able to identify and extract the abstract paragraph(s ) for use when we do not have the abstract from another source . in these cases ,",
    "the ocrd text is indexed so that it is searchable and the extracted image of the abstract paragraph is displayed in lieu of an ascii version of the abstract . extracting the abstract from the scanned pages is somewhat tedious , as it requires establishing different sets of parameters for each journal , as well as for different fonts used over the years by the same journal .",
    "the ocr software can be taught how to determine where the abstract ends , but it does not work for every article due to oddities such as author lists which extend beyond the first page of an article , and articles which are in a different format from others in the same volume ( e.g. no keywords or multiple columns ) .",
    "the ads currently contains approximately 25,000 of these abstract images and more will be added as we continue to scan the historical literature .    we are also currently using the ocr software to render electronic versions of the entire scanned articles for indexing purposes .",
    "we will not use this for display to the users , but hope to be able to index it to provide the possibility of full text searching at some future date .",
    "we estimate that the indexing of our almost one million scanned pages with our current hardware and software will take approximately two years of dedicated cpu time .",
    "the last benefit that we gain from the ocr software is the conversion of the reference list at the end of articles .",
    "we use parsed reference lists from the scanned articles to build citation and reference lists for display through the c and r links of the available items .",
    "since reference lists are typically in one of several standard formats , we parse each reference for author , journal , volume and page number for most journal articles , and conference name , author , and page number for many conference proceedings .",
    "this enables us to build bibliographic code lists for references contained in that article ( r links ) and invert these lists to build bibliographic code lists of articles which cite this paper ( c links ) .",
    "we are able to use this process to identify and therefore add commonly - cited articles which are currently missing from the ads .",
    "this is usually data prior to 1975 or astronomy - related articles published in non - astronomy journals .",
    "the article service currently contains 250 gbytes of scans , which consists of 1,128,955 article pages comprising 138,789 articles .",
    "these numbers increase on a regular basis , both as we add more articles from the older literature and as we scan new journals .",
    "a description of the data in the ads would be incomplete without a discussion of the interaction between the ads and the electronic journals .",
    "the data available on - line from the journal publishers is an extension of the data in the ads and vice versa .",
    "this interaction is greatly facilitated by the acceptance of the bibliographic code by many journal publishers as a means for accessing their on - line articles .",
    "access to articles currently on - line at the journal sites through the ads comprises a significant percent of the on - line journal access ( see overview ) .",
    "the best model for interaction between the ads and a journal publisher is the university of chicago press ( hereafter ucp ) , publisher of _ apj , apjl , apjs , aj , _ and _ pasp_. when a new volume appears on - line at ucp , the ads is notified by email and an sgml header file for each of those articles is simultaneously transferred to our site .",
    "the data are parsed and loaded into the system and appropriate links are created .",
    "however , prior to this , the ucp has made use of the ads to build their electronic version through the use of our bibliographic code reference resolver .",
    "our bibliographic code reference resolver ( @xcite ) was developed to provide the capability to automatically parse , identify , and verify citations appearing in astronomical literature . by verifying the existence of a reference through the ads , journals and conference proceedings editors",
    "are able to publish documents containing hyperlinks pointing to stable , unique urls .",
    "increasingly more journals are linking to the ads in their reference sections , providing users with the ability to read referenced articles with the click of a mouse button .    during the copy editing phase ,",
    "ucp editors query the ads reference resolver and determine if each reference exactly matches a bibliographic code in the ads .",
    "if there is a match , a link to the ads is established for this entry in their reference section .",
    "if there is not a match , one of several scenarios takes place .",
    "first , if it is a valid reference not yet included in the ads ( most often the case for  fringe \" articles , those peripherally associated with astronomy ) , our reference resolver captures the information necessary to add it to our database during the next update .",
    "second , if it is a valid reference unable to be parsed by the resolver ( sometimes the case for conference proceedings or phd theses ) , no action is taken and no link is listed in the reference section .",
    "third , if there is an error in the reference as determined by the reference resolver , the ucp editors may ask for a correction or clarification from the authors .",
    "the last option demonstrates the power of the reference resolver , which has been taught on a journal - by - journal basis how complete the coverage of that journal is in the ads . before the implementation of the reference resolver , ucp was able to match 72% of references in _ apj _ articles ( e. owens , private communication ) .",
    "early results from the use of the reference resolver show that we are now able to match conference proceedings , so this number should become somewhat larger . it is unlikely that we will ever match more than 90% of references in an article due to references such as  private communication \" ,  in press \" , and preprints , as well as author errors ( see section [ summary ] ) .",
    "our own reference resolving of ocrd reference lists shows that we can match approximately 86 the ads provides multiple ways for authors and journal publishers to link to the ads ( see search ) .",
    "we make every effort to facilitate individuals and organizations linking to us .",
    "this is easily done for simple searches such as the verification of a bibliographic code or an author search for a single spelling .",
    "however , given the complexity of the system , these automated searches can quickly become complicated .",
    "details for conference proceedings editors or journal publishers who are interested in establishing or improving links to the ads are available upon request .",
    "in particular , those who have individual tex macros incorporated in their references can use our bibliographic code resolver to facilitate linking to the ads .",
    "as of this writing ( 12/1999 ) , there are 524,304 references in the astronomy database , 523,498 references in the instrumentation database , 443,858 references in the physics database , and 3467 references in the preprint database , for a total of almost 1.5 million references in the system .",
    "astronomers currently write approximately 18,000 journal articles annually , and possibly that many additional conference proceedings papers per year .",
    "more than half of the journal papers appear in peer - reviewed journals .",
    "these numbers are more than double what they were in 1975 , in spite of an increase in the number of words per page in most of the major journals ( @xcite ) , and an increase in number of pages per article ( @xcite ) . at the current rate of publication",
    ", astronomers could be writing 25,000 journal papers per year by 2001 and an additional 20,000 conference proceedings papers .",
    "figure [ histogram ] shows the total number of papers for each year in the astronomy database since 1975 , divided into refereed journal papers , non - refereed journal papers , and conferences ( including reports and theses ) .",
    "there are three features worth noting .",
    "first , the increase in total references in 1980 is due to the inclusion of helen knudsen s monthly astronomy and astrophysics index , a rich source of data for both journals and conference proceedings which began coverage in late 1979 and continued until 1995 .",
    "second , the recent increase in conferences included in the astronomy database ( starting around 1996 ) is due to the inclusion of conference proceedings table of contents provided by collaborating librarians and typed in by our contractors .",
    "last , the decrease in numbers for 1999 is due to coverage for that year not yet being complete in the ads .",
    "the growth rate of the instrumentation and physics databases is difficult to estimate , primarily because we do not have datasets which are as complete as astronomy . in any case , the need for the organization and maintenance of this large volume of data is clearly important to every research astronomer .",
    "fortunately , the ads was designed to be able to handle this large quantity of data and to be able to grow with new kinds of data .",
    "new available item links have been added for new types of data as they became available ( e.g. the links to complete book entries at the library of congress ) and future datasets ( e.g. from future space missions ) should be able to be added in the same fashion .    as with any dataset of this magnitude , there is some fraction of references in the system which are incorrect .",
    "this is unavoidable given the large number of data sources , errors in indices and tables of contents as originally published , and human error .",
    "in addition , many authors do not give full attention to verifying all references in a paper , resulting in the introduction of errors in many places . in a systematic study of more than 1000 references",
    "contained in a single issue of the _ astrophysical journal _ , abt ( 1992 ) found that more than 12% of those contained errors .",
    "this number should be significantly reduced with the integration of the ads reference resolver in the electronic publishing process .",
    "however , any mistakes in the ads can and will get propagated , so steps are being taken by us to maximize accuracy of our entries .",
    "locating and identifying correlations between multiple bibliographic codes which describe the same article is a time - consuming and sometimes subjective task as many pairs of bibliographic codes need to be verified by manually looking up papers in the library .",
    "we use the abstract service itself for gross matching of bibliographic codes , submitting a search with author and title , and considering any resulting matches with a score of 1.0 as a potential match .",
    "these matches are only potential matches which require verification since authors can submit the same paper to more than one publication source ( e.g. baas and a refereed journal ) , and since errata published with the same title and author list will perfectly match the original paper .    when a volume or year is mismatched , it is usually obvious which of a pair of matched bibliographic codes is correct , but if a page number is off , the decision as to which code is correct can not always be automated .",
    "we also need to consider matches with very high scores less than 1.0 since these are the matches where an author name may be incorrect .",
    "the correction of errors of this sort is ongoing work which is carried out as often as time and resources permit .    the evolution of the internet and the world wide web , along with the explosion of astronomical services on the web has enabled the ads to provide access to our databases in an open and uniform environment .",
    "we have been able to hyperlink both to our own resources and to other on - line resources such as the journal bibliographies ( @xcite ) . as part of the international collaboration urania ( universal research archive of networked information in astronomy , @xcite ) , the ads enables a fully functioning distributed digital library of astronomical information which provides power and utility previously unavailable to the researcher .",
    "perhaps the largest factor which has contributed to the success of the ads is the willing cooperation of the aas , cds , and all the journal publishers .",
    "the ads has largely become the means for linking together smaller pieces of a bigger picture , making an elaborate digital library for astronomers a reality .",
    "we currently collaborate with over fifty groups in creating and maintaining cross - links among data centers .",
    "these additional collaborations with individuals and institutions worldwide allow us to provide many value - added features to the system such as object information , author email addresses , mail order forms for articles , citations , article scans , and more .",
    "a listing of these collaborations is provided in table  [ table6 ] .",
    "any omissions from this table are purely unintentional , as the ads values all of our colleagues and the users benefit not only from the major collaborators but the minor ones as well , as these are often more difficult for users to learn about independently .",

    "usage statistics for the abstract service ( see overview ) indicate that astronomers and librarians at scientific institutions are eager to take advantage of the information that the ads provides .",
