    "for many years , it was thought that radiative losses via x - ray emission in clusters of galaxies leads to a substantial gas inflow , which was called a `` cooling flow '' ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , x - ray spectra taken with _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ fail to show line emission from ions having intermediate or low temperatures , implying that the cooling rate is at least 5 or 10 times less than that previously assumed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations suggest that a gas inflow is prevented by some heat sources that balance the radiative losses .",
    "there are two popular ideas about the heating sources .",
    "one is energy injection from a central agn of a cluster @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations show that agns at cluster centers actually disturb the intracluster medium ( icm ) around them @xcite , although some of them were already discovered by _",
    "rosat _ @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that buoyant bubbles created by the agns mix and heat the ambient icm to some extent @xcite .",
    "the other possible heat source is thermal conduction from the hot outer layers of clusters @xcite .",
    "however , it has already been known that the icm heating by agns or thermal conduction has problems . for the agn heating",
    ", the efficiency of the heating must be quite high @xcite .",
    "moreover , the intermittent activity of an agn makes the temperature profile of the host cluster irregular , which is inconsistent with observations @xcite . for the thermal conduction",
    ", stability is the most serious problem ; either the observed temperature gradient disappears or the conduction has a negligible effect relative to radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "moreover , thermal conduction alone can not sufficiently heat the central regions of some clusters @xcite .",
    "although a `` double heating model '' that incorporates the effects of simultaneous heating by both the central agn and thermal conduction may alleviate the stability problem @xcite , @xcite indicates that the conductivity must still be about @xmath0 times the spitzer value .    in this paper",
    ", we consider another natural heating source . in the icm ,",
    "fluid turbulence is generated by substructure motion or cluster mergers . from numerical simulations",
    ", @xcite showed that the turbulent velocities in the icm is about 20%30% of the sound speed even when a cluster is relatively relaxed .",
    "such turbulence generates acoustic waves in the icm .",
    "compressive characters of the acoustic waves with a relatively large amplitude inevitably lead to the the steepening of the wave fronts to form shocks . as a result",
    ", the waves can heat the surrounding icm through the shock dissipation . a similar heating mechanism",
    "has also been proposed in the solar corona ; the waves are excited by granule motions of surface convection @xcite .",
    "the idea of wave heating in the icm was proposed by @xcite , but the study was limited to order - of - magnitude estimates . in this paper , we study the wave heating by an analytical model and numerical simulations .",
    "we use cosmological parameters of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "in the icm the magnetic pressure is generally negligible against the gas pressure @xcite .",
    "therefore , acoustic waves ( strictly speaking , fast mode waves in high-@xmath4 plasma ) could carry much larger amount of energy than other modes of magnetohydrodynamical waves .",
    "we expect that turbulence in the icm excites acoustic waves that propagate in various directions . in this paper , we focus on the acoustic waves traveling inward , which play an important role in the heating of the cluster center .",
    "these waves , having a relatively large but finite amplitude , eventually form shocks to shape sawtooth waves ( n - waves ) and directly heat the surrounding icm by dissipation of their wave energy .",

    ", we will show that even when @xmath32 is much smaller than 0.2 , the observed profiles can be reproduced if wave heating is included .",
    "however , we found that if @xmath32 is too small , the obtained temperature profile is too steep to be consistent with the observation .",
    "for ser  15903 , we adopt @xmath62 , which is suggested by @xcite in a turbulent mhd medium .",

    "was reported @xcite .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath68 .",
    "we note that if we assume that wave heating is effective and that @xmath6 is much smaller than the above values , we can not reproduce both density and temperature profiles obtained by x - ray observations ; we get too high temperature and too low density",

    "the _ xmm - newton _ data of a1795 are also obtained by @xcite and they are similar to those obtained by @xcite , although the former is not deprojected contrary to the latter .",
    "the good agreement between the model and the data suggests that wave heating is a promising candidate of the mechanism that solves the cooling flow problem . in figure",
    "[ fig : tn ] , densities go to infinity and temperatures go down to zero at @xmath72  kpc .",
    "this suggests that waves injected outside of this radius can not reach the cluster center .    in figure",
    "[ fig : af]a , we present the wave velocity amplitude normalized by the sound velocity ( @xmath16 ) . as the n - waves propagate into the central regions of the cluster , @xmath16 increases rapidly .",
    "this is mainly because of the geometrical convergence to the cluster center , whereas the total wave luminosity (= energy flux times @xmath73 ) mostly dissipates through the inward propagation in itself . since @xmath74 at @xmath75  kpc for both a1795 and ser  15903 , the results may not be quantitatively correct there .",
    "we note that the gas velocity for the region of @xmath76  kpc is very small compared with the sound velocity and thus our ignorance of @xmath18 in equation  ( [ eq : motion ] ) is justified .    in figure",

    "assume that an observer made observations of the model clusters and the temperature distributions were exactly measured .",
    "if the observer _ assumed _ the classical conductivity , the heat flux measured by the observer should be @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) because of the definition of @xmath82 ( equation  [ [ eq : fc ] ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : af]b shows that the observer would measure an x - ray emission much larger than that predicted by the classical thermal conduction ( @xmath83 ) if the energy swallowed by the black hole at the cluster center is small .",
    "such large x - ray emissions have actually been estimated in some clusters @xcite .",
    "wave heating model can account for the observations without the help of heating by agns .",

    "contrary to figure  [ fig : tn ] , we use a linear scale for the distance from the cluster center for both temperature and density profiles to see shock structures .",

    "co , conduction dominates cooling and the solution is stable for a long time .",
    "the suppression factor of the conductivity , @xmath47 , in model  co is the same as that of @xcite .",
    "the temperature gradient at the cluster center is less steep than that obtained by @xcite .",
    "this may be because of the differences of the boundary conditions or the initial conditions .",
    "figures  [ fig : w1 ] and  [ fig : w2 ] show the temperature and density profiles for models  w1 and  w2 , respectively .",
    "as we predicted in figure  [ fig : af ] , waves are amplified in the central region . a shock is seen at @xmath115  kpc in model  w1 .",
    "both temperature and density diverge at the cluster center because these are one - dimensional simulations and waves focus on the cluster center . in the outer region ,",
    "the shape of waves is complicated .",
    "this is because we adopted the reflection condition at the inner boundary and the inward and outward waves interact . for model  w1 , @xmath116  gyr , and for model",
    "w2 , @xmath117  gyr .",
    "they are much larger than @xmath110 for model  cf .",
    "this means the wave heating is effective .    in models  m1 and  m2",
    ", we include both thermal conduction and waves .",
    "the results of model  m1 and model  m2 are almost the same as those of model  w1 and  co , respectively .",
    "the cooling time - scale @xmath110 of model  m1 is shorter than that of model  w1 , because shocks are weakened by the thermal conduction . in model  m2",
    ", the conduction dominates the wave heating .",
    "our analytical model and numerical simulations show that acoustic waves are amplified at the cluster center and can heat the cluster core .",
    "one should note that our assumption , that is , the spherical symmetry , could affect the amplification quantitatively . for more realistic modeling",
    ", we should consider that real clusters are not exactly spherically symmetric .",
    "however , @xcite indicated that even if a cluster is not spherically symmetric , the lower temperature and smaller sound velocity at the cluster center should have waves focus on the center . in order to study this effect",
    ", we need to perform high - resolution multi - dimensional numerical simulations ( wada , fujita , & , suzuki 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "since the focusing effect depends on the temperature gradient , it may solve the fine - tuning problem of the heating of cluster cores .",
    "if the cooling dominates heating , the temperature at the cluster center decreases and the temperature gradient in the core increases .",
    "this strengthens the focusing effect and wave heating becomes more efficient .",
    "multi - dimensional simulations have another benefit ; it is free from the inner boundary conditions that we set in our one - dimensional simulations .    if waves are actually responsible for the heating in cluster cores , weak shocks should be observed there in some clusters . in our simulations",
    ", waves are amplified at @xmath118  kpc ( figures  [ fig : w1 ] and  [ fig : w2 ] ) .",
    "thus , if the wave length is large ( @xmath119  kpc ) , the shocks are not necessarily observed in all clusters .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , the passing of waves may cause gas - sloshing around cluster cores . observations of fine structures in many cluster cores will be useful to understand the heating mechanism there .    in the central regions of clusters ,",
    "turbulence generated by interaction of amplified waves from various directions could be observed as broadened metal lines by future x - ray observatories .",
    "observational studies of optical emission lines revealed that there is warm gas at some cluster centers and that the velocity widths range from 100 to @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "these warm gas may be embodied in and move with the hot turbulent icm ( see * ? ? ?",
    "through analytical and numerical approaches , we have shown that acoustic waves generated by turbulence in the icm in the outer region of a cluster can effectively heat the central part of the cluster .",
    "the heat flux by the waves may exceed that by thermal conduction .",
    "the process presented here is phenomenologically analogous to the collapse of a `` tsunami '' ( a seismic sea wave ) at seashore owing to the change of depth of the sea . as in tsunamis , even if the waves have small amplitude at their origin , they could bring huge damage at a distant point , namely the cluster center .",
    "of course , one should note that tsunamis are gravity - driven waves and not acousitc waves . in the analytical studies ,",
    "we have obtained time - independent solutions and compared the predicted density and temperature profiles with the observed ones ; they are consistent with each other . in general ,",
    "we have confirmed the results obtained by the analytical studies by one - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "since we assumed that a cluster is spherically symmetric and the assumption leads to artificial focusing of waves , one should take the quantitative results with care .",
    "however , it has been indicated that even if a cluster is not spherically symmetric , waves are focused by the temperature gradient at the cluster center .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to study the wave heating by multi - dimensional analyses .",
