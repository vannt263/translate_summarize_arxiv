    "the abundant experimental knowledge has not yet produced a sufficiently deep understanding of the physics of formation of quantum dots that could guide the way to control the growth process .",
    "in this situation first - principles simulations can be helpful in sheding light on the atomistic mechanisms that lead to dot nucleation at surfaces .    in the present paper ,",
    "we address one of the most - studied systems : inas quantum dots grown on a gaas(001 ) substrate , where the lattice mismatch between inas and gaas is of the order of @xmath6% .",
    "strain relaxation at the surface acts as a driving force for a self - assembly process , the so called stranski - krastanov growth mode @xcite , with the deposition of an atomically thin ingaas wetting layer ( wl ) and subsequent surface mass transport accompanied by a 2d to 3d growth transition .",
    "we focus our attention on the structural properties of the wl on which quantum dots nucleate , and on the interaction between a single in adatom and the surface , in order to find where the diffusion barriers are located and what the possible adsorption sites on the surface are , as a function of the wetting layer reconstruction .    we have chosen to investigate mainly the @xmath7 reconstruction of the @xmath1 surface because of its stability under in - rich conditions and under compressive strain @xcite which is the case for the inas wl grown on gaas .",
    "moreover , a @xmath8 reconstruction was found @xcite to occur on the @xmath1 wetting layer at the onset of dot nucleation in a in - rich wl condition .",
    "we have modeled a wl at a inas coverage @xmath9 monolayer ( ml ) which is close to the critical value corresponding to the 2d to 3d transition @xcite .",
    "the structural and geometrical properties of this surface have been investigated . using the @xmath5 reconstruction we have calculated the pes for a single in adatom , with the aim to understand what are the implications of the wl morphology ( strain and composition ) on the adsorption and surface mobility of",

    "iv our results are compared with those regarding other surface reconstructions in order to extract a rationale for the dependence on in adsorption and diffusion on the local structure of the @xmath1 surface . finally , a summary is given at the end of the paper .",
    "we performed first principles calculations within density functional theory in the local density approximation ( dft - lda ) @xcite using the exchange and correlation potential of ceperley and alder @xcite as parametrized by perdew and zunger @xcite .",
    "for this kind of calculations both lda @xcite and gga @xcite have been used in the literature .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that both methods give qualitatively the same picture for the description of adatom adsorption on a surface , although lda usually gives larger values for binding energies than gga @xcite .",
    "only the details can be different : lda tends to overestimate the binding energy but for lattice constants , elastic moduli and surface energies the lda calculated values are generally closer to the experimentally determined ones .",
    "we have used norm - conserving pseudopotentials treating the outermost s- and p - shells of ga , in and as as valence electrons , and the electronic wave functions were expanded in plane - waves , with a @xmath12 ry kinetic energy cutoff .",
    "the energy cutoff has been tested in order to reach convergence for the lattice bulk properties of gaas and inas .",
    "the core corrected atomic pseudopotentials have been tested on bulk ga , in and as , where the determined equilibrium configurations and elastic moduli compare well with the experimental data .",
    "the equilibrium lattice parameters obtained for the gaas and inas bulk phases are @xmath13   and @xmath14  , which are slightly smaller than the experimental ones .",
    "thus our calculated lattice mismatch is @xmath15% , smaller than the experimental value .",
    "this is going to underestimate the wl strain . in sec .",
    "iv we will compare our results with results @xcite where this effect was instead overestimated .",
    "starting from the gaas structure , we have set up the @xmath1 oriented supercell containing 4 layers of gaas , covered with 1.75 layers of inas arranged according to the @xmath16 surface reconstruction . the lower layer of ga atoms is kept fixed during the cell relaxation , in order to mimic the constraint due to the underlying semi - infinite bulk , and it is passivated with pseudo hydrogen atoms of @xmath17 electron charge .",
    "the slab is repeated along the @xmath1 direction with a periodicity @xmath18 and a separation of about 10   of vacuum . as for the number of gaas layers , we have found that only two layers suffice to obtain a correct description of the pes , minima and maxima positions .",
    "the refinement using two more gaas layers produces a difference in the barrier heights all within @xmath19 mev .",
    "brillouin - zone ( bz ) integration was carried out using a set of special @xmath20-points equivalent to 16 points in the @xmath21 surface bz .",
    "a smearing of @xmath22 ry has been used in order to account for the possible metalization of the surface electronic structure .    in the @xmath23 reconstruction the last complete atomic layer is constituted by as atoms .",

    "we see that the range of stability of the @xmath5 phase , when gaas is covered with the inas ad - layer , is larger than that of the bare gaas surface .",

    "this is in agreement with previous calculations showing a stabilization of the @xmath5 phase for inas under isotropic compressive strain @xcite which is the condition of the inas layer grown on gaas .",
    "regarding the atomic structures , the comparison of the distances between the atomic planes , in the inas covered gaas case , shows that the values are systematically larger than those obtained for the pure gaas surface by about @xmath47 % , owing to the stress originated by the inas / gaas lattice mismatch .",

    "the minima a@xmath75 and a@xmath76 are shifted towards the trench with respect to the corresponding ones of the @xmath5 reconstruction .",

    "this process requires overcoming an energy barrier , thus its rate should depend on the growth temperature .",
    "these sites can be of significant interest , since they introduce a local modification of the pes that can be very important for surface diffusion .",
