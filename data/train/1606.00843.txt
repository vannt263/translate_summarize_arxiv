    "short period binary white dwarfs will lose angular momentum through gravitational wave radiation and start mass transfer .",
    "the shortest period detached double white dwarf system currently known , j0651 @xcite , will start mass transfer in less than 1 myr .",
    "what happens next depends on the stability of mass transfer .    for roughly equal mass binaries , the two stars will merge and form a more massive white dwarf ( for co+co white dwarfs ) , an r cor bor star ( for co+he white dwarf mergers ) , or a single subdwarf ( for he+he white dwarfs ) .",
    "depending on the total mass of the system , the mergers can also lead to underluminous or normal type ia supernovae in both co+co and co+he white dwarf mergers @xcite .",
    "the latter systems may go through a double detonation , in which the detonation of the surface he layer leads to the detonation of the underlying co core white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for binaries with extreme mass ratios , the mass transfer will be stable @xcite , leading to the formation of am cvn binaries .",
    "am cvn have orbital periods of 5 - 65 min and involve an accreting white dwarf and a he - rich donor star . given the stability of the mass transfer , the orbit slowly expands to accommodate the increasing size of the degenerate donor , the mass transfer rate decreases , and the binary evolves into a massive white dwarf with a planetary size companion . despite large scale efforts to find am cvn @xcite",
    ", there are only 52 systems currently known .",
    "hence , am cvn represent the end product of a rare and fine - tuned evolution in binary systems @xcite",
    ".    there are three formation channels for am cvn with three different donor stars ; low - mass white dwarfs , helium stars , or evolved main - sequence stars .",
    "the population synthesis models predict that the double white dwarf channel dominates the am cvn formation @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to distinguish between the different formation channels based on the observed am cvn population , since all three channels essentially lead to very low - mass degenerate he - rich donors .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that n / c abundance ratios significantly differ between the he - white dwarf and he star donors , and use this to identify he white dwarf donors in three am cvn systems .",
    "@xcite present the first compelling evidence for an am cvn progenitor with an evolved main - sequence donor .",
    "they constrain the orbital period of css1122 - 1110 , a cataclysmic variable with unusually strong he lines , to 65.2 min and use the superhump period excess to infer a mass ratio of 0.017 .",
    "@xcite identify three other systems with evolved main - sequence donors as potential progenitors of am cvn , though the mass ratios are not as extreme as css1122 - 1110 .",
    "observationally , it remains unclear what is the dominant formation channel for am cvn systems .",
    "the elm survey ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) has found 76 short period double white dwarfs so far , including several systems with extreme mass ratios .",
    "@xcite identify two of these systems , j0751 - 0141 and j1741 + 6526 , as the first confirmed am cvn progenitors from the double white dwarf channel . here",
    "we present follow - up observations of four more elm white dwarfs with massive companions , and demonstrate that two of these targets will have stable mass transfer .",
    "in addition , we estimate the merger rate of elm white dwarfs with massive companions .",
    "we present our target selection and observations in  2 , and discuss the nature of the companions and the inspiral rate of extreme mass ratio binaries in the elm survey in  3 .",
    "we conclude in  4 .",
    "elm white dwarfs are single - lined spectroscopic binaries in which the elm white dwarf dominates the light of the system .",
    "we define @xmath3 as the visible low mass white dwarf and @xmath4 as its unseen companion .",
    "we measure orbital period and radial velocity semi - amplitude , and derive @xmath3 by comparing our spectroscopic @xmath5 and @xmath6 measurements to evolutionary tracks for low - mass he - core white dwarfs @xcite . in the absence of information about inclination , such as eclipses ,",
    "the observations provide a lower limit on @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : target ] shows the minimum total system mass versus the orbital period for the 76 binaries discovered in the elm survey .",
    "nine of these targets have previous chandra or xmm - newton observations that rule out neutron star companions , and an additional six targets have radio data that rule out milli - second pulsars . to search for neutron star companions , we selected four of the most massive binary systems known from an earlier version of the elm survey sample for follow - up x - ray observations .",
    "table 1 presents the physical parameters of these four systems , including the minimum companion masses @xcite .        [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      a significant number of short period binary white dwarfs display photometric variations due to tidal distortions , the relativistic beaming effect , or eclipses @xcite .",
    "the photometric variations are a function of the white dwarf radii , orbital separation , and orbital inclination .",
    "for example , the two previously confirmed am cvn progenitors , j0751 and j1741 display 3.2% and 1.3% ellipsoidal variations .",
    "the amplitude of the ellipsoidal effect is roughly @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the orbital semi - major axis and @xmath9 is the radius of the primary @xcite .",
    "the four targets presented in table 1 have orbital periods and separations significantly larger than j0751 and j1741 .",
    "hence , the expected amplitude of the ellipsoidal effect is smaller than 0.05% for all four targets .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] displays the unfiltered optical light curves for three of our targets from the catalina sky survey @xcite . the remaining target , j0811 , has a galaxy within 6.6@xmath10 , and its light curve is not available in the catalina sky survey data release 2 .",
    "j0811 was not observed by the palomar transient factory ( ptf , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we do not have any photometric constraints on this binary .",
    "the catalina data for j0755 , j1143 , and j2132 are relatively noisy , and a fourier analysis does not reveal any significant periodicities for the latter two systems .",
    "the right panels show the catalina and @xmath11band ptf light curves for these two stars , folded on the best - fit period from the radial velocity data .",
    "there are no significant photometric variations at the orbital period for j1143 and j2132 .    the catalina data for j0755 show large scatter that is consistent with long term variations of order @xmath12 d. however",
    ", j0755 is within 18@xmath10 of a @xmath13 mag star , and it is not clear if the catalina photometry is affected by this nearby source .",
    "we obtained follow - up @xmath14-band optical photometry of j0755 over 20.7 h between ut 2016 feb 28 and mar 3 using celestron 28-cm and 35-cm schmidt - cassegrain telescopes at the acton sky portal private observatory .",
    "the top right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] shows the phase - folded light curve for j0755 .",
    "there is no evidence of photometric variations at the orbital period for j0755 in our data , as well as the ptf data that covers mjd 55081 - 57468 ( t. kupfer 2016 , priv .",
    "comm ) . given the precision of our light curves and the relatively small amplitudes of the predicted ellipsoidal variations and the doppler beaming effect ,",
    "the absence of optical photometric variations in j0755 , as well as j1443 and j2132 , is not surprising .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of photometric variations leaves us with no additional information on the binaries .",
    "our chandra and swift x - ray observations demonstrate that all four of our low - mass white dwarf targets almost certainly have massive white dwarf companions .",
    "j0811 is the most extreme system in our sample with a 0.18 @xmath15 white dwarf and a @xmath16 white dwarf companion .",
    "however , the merger time due to gravitational wave radiation is longer than a hubble time .",
    "j2132 is the second most massive system , with a 0.18 @xmath15 white dwarf and a @xmath17 white dwarf companion .",
    "given the mass ratio of @xmath18 , j2132 will start stable mass transfer in 5.5 - 7.2 gyr and turn into an am cvn .",
    "figure [ fig : stab ] shows the mass transfer stability limits from @xcite .",
    "binaries with a mass ratio of @xmath19 are expected to have unstable mass transfer and merge .",
    "the eclipsing , short period double white dwarfs j1152 + 0248 @xcite , css 41177 @xcite , and the double lined binary wd 1242 - 105 @xcite are excellent examples of systems in this region . objects with mass ratios below the solid line will have stable mass transfer , which leads to am cvn systems instead of mergers .    along with the previously identified am cvn progenitors j0751 , j1741",
    "@xcite and j1257 + 5428 @xcite , j0811 and j2132 are clearly in the stable mass transfer region ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . out of these five systems , all but j0811 have merger times shorter than a hubble time . hence , there are now four confirmed double white dwarf progenitors of am cvn .",
    "in addition to these four systems , there are a number of other elm white dwarfs with unknown inclinations that are likely to have extreme mass ratios .",
    "for example , j1443 has a mass ratio of @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] ) , which places it in the intermediate region where the stability of mass transfer depends on the synchronization timescale ( spin - orbit coupling ) of the binary . assuming that the orbital inclination is distributed randomly in @xmath21 within the allowed observational constraints , there is a 46% chance that j1443 is in the disk accretion region .",
    "@xcite define a clean sample of 60 binary systems from the elm survey , which is 60% complete in a well defined color and magnitude range .",
    "they identify 63% of their sample as disk objects , and use standard galactic stellar density models to estimate the elm white dwarf local space density . using the stellar density model of @xcite , the merger rate of disk elm white dwarf binaries in the milky way is @xmath22 yr@xmath2 , with a factor of 1.8 uncertainty in this number .",
    "@xcite find an am cvn formation rate of @xmath23 yr@xmath2 , derived using the same stellar density model and using observations from the same footprint of sky ( sdss ) .",
    "hence , the merger rate of all elm white dwarf binaries is about 40 times larger than the am cvn formation rate .",
    "based on this , @xcite conclude that most double white dwarfs will not form am cvn .",
    "a remaining question is whether the inspiral rate of the extreme mass ratio systems in the elm survey is consistent with the am cvn formation rate .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations of the clean , disk elm white dwarf binary sample to estimate the probability that each system has a mass ratio that puts it below the stability limit of @xcite for disk accretion .",
    "since the elm survey binaries were selected based on color , the distribution of inclination angles should be random .",
    "we include the constraints on inclination for eclipsing systems , and the binaries with x - ray data",
    ". the allowed inclinations map to an allowed distribution of @xmath4 for each binary .",
    "every elm white dwarf binary has a likelihood of having mass ratios that fall in the stable mass transfer region of parameter space , however not every binary will merge within a hubble time .",
    "we estimate the underlying merger rate by taking the observed distribution of merger times and assuming that elm white dwarf binaries form at a constant rate over the past gyr , the approximate time span that elm white dwarfs are detectable in the elm survey color selection .",
    "the inspiral rate for the subset of binaries with extreme mass ratios ( that would lead to stable disk accretion ) is a factor of 30 lower than the total elm white dwarf binary merger rate .",
    "this is due to factors of 10 longer gravitational wave merger times for the extreme mass ratio systems in our sample , and factors of 3 fewer stars in the stable mass transfer region .",
    "hence , we estimate that the formation rate of stable mass transfer systems from binary elm white dwarfs is @xmath1 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is remarkably similar to the am cvn formation rate found by @xcite . note that both rates are uncertain by 60 - 80%",
    "nevertheless , the extreme mass ratio double white dwarf systems found in the elm survey can explain a significant fraction , and perhaps the entire population , of am cvn found in the galaxy .",
    "we provide strong evidence against neutron star companions in four elm white dwarfs with massive companions . j0755 and j0811 are the most massive binary white dwarfs identified in the elm survey , with total binary masses of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . however , both j0755 and j0811 have orbital periods longer than half a day",
    ". hence , they will not interact within a hubble time .",
    "the remaining two stars , j1443 and j2132 , have binary mass ratios of @xmath20 , and they have short enough orbital periods to start mass transfer in several gyr .",
    "j2132 is clearly in the stable mass transfer range in figure [ fig : stab ] .",
    "hence , there are now four confirmed double white dwarf progenitors of am cvn ; j0751 ,",
    "j1741 @xcite , j1257 + 5428 @xcite , and j2132 .    more importantly ,",
    "we take the entire sample of elm white dwarf binaries , consider the distribution of mass ratios for each system , and derive the inspiral rate for the subset that satisfy the @xcite stability criterion for disk accretion .",
    "this rate is essentially identical to the am cvn formation rate from @xcite ; there are sufficient numbers of double white dwarf progenitors of am cvn to account for the entire population of am cvn in the galaxy .",
    "we thank the organizers and attendees of the fourth international workshop on am cvn stars for useful discussions . support for this work",
