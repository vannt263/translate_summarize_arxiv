    "so , in order to prove that @xmath350 converges to @xmath351 as @xmath47 , it is enough to show that @xmath325 tends to @xmath64 in trace norm . by theorem 2.20 of @xcite and the positivity of @xmath325 and @xmath64 , it then suffices to prove that @xmath352 weakly , and that @xmath353 as @xmath47 .",
    "so we have to prove that for @xmath354 , @xmath355 and that @xmath356 both ( [ weakconvergence ] ) and ( [ traceconvergence ] ) follow easily from the pointwise convergence @xmath357 , the uniform bound @xmath358 and the dominated convergence theorem .",
