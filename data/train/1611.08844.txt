    "geometrical - optical illusions ( gois ) have been discovered in the xix century by german psychologists ( oppel 1854 @xcite , hering , 1878 , @xcite ) and have been defined as situations in which there is an awareness of a mismatch of geometrical properties between an item in object space and its associated percept @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these illusions is that they relate to misjudgements of geometrical properties of contours and they show up equally for dark configurations on a bright background and viceversa . for the interested reader , a historical survey of the discovery of geometrical - optical illusions",
    "is included in appendix i of @xcite .",
    "our intention here is not to make a classification of these phenomena , which is already widely present in literature ( coren e girgus , 1978 , @xcite ; robinson , 1998 , @xcite ; wade , 1982 , @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose a mathematical model for gois based on the functional architecture of low level visual cortex ( v1/v2 ) .",
    "this neuro - mathematical model will allow us to interpret at a neural level the origin of gois and to reproduce the arised percept for this class of phenomena .",
    "the main idea is to adopt the model of the functional geometry of v1 provided in @xcite and to consider that the image stimulus will modulate the connectivity .",
    "when projected onto the visual space , the modulated connectivity gives rise to a riemannian metric which is at the origin of the visual space deformation .",
    "the displacement vector field at every point of the stimulus is mathematically computed by solving a poisson problem and the perceived image is finally reproduced .",
    "the considered phenomena consist , as shown in figure [ fig:1ills ] , in straight lines over different backgrounds ( radial lines , concentric circles , etc ) .",
    "the interaction betwen target and context either induces an effect of curvature of the straight lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1:4 ] , [ fig:1:5 ] , [ fig:1:1 ] ) , eliminates the bending effect ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1:6 ] ) , or induces an effect of unparallelism ( fig . [ fig:1:2 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec:1 ] we review the state of the art concerning the previous mathematical models proposed . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we will briefly recall the functional achitecture of the visual cortex and the cortical based model introduced by citti and sarti in @xcite . in section [ sec:3bis ] we will introduce the neuro - mathematical model proposed for gois , taking into account the modulation of the functional architecture induced by the stimulus . in [ sec:3 ] the numerical implementation of the mathematical model",
    "will be explained and applied to a number of examples .",
    "results are finally discussed .    1.8 in    2.1 in    1.8 in    2.1 in    1.8 in",
    "in psychology the distal stimulus is defined as _ the light reflected off a physical object in the external world _ ; when we look at an image ( distal stimulus ) we can not actually experience the image physically with vision , we can only experience it in our mind as proximal stimulus @xcite , @xcite .",
    "geometrical optical illusions arise when the distal stimulus and its percept differ in a perceivable way . as explained by westheimer in @xcite",
    ", we can conveniently divide illusions into those in which spatial deformations are a consequence of the exigencies of the processing in the domain of brightness and the true geometrical - optical illusions , which are misperceptions of geometrical properties of contours in simple figures .",
    "some of the most famous geometric illusions of this last type are shown in figure [ fig:1ills ] .",
    "the importance of this study lies in the possibility , through the analysis of these phenomena combined with physiological recordings , to help to guide neuroscientific research ( eagleman , @xcite ) in understanding the role of lateral inhibition , feedback mechanisms between different layers of the visual process and to lead new experiments and hypothesis on receptive fields of v1 and v2 .",
    "many studies , which relies on neuro - physiological and imaging data , show the evidence that neurons in at least two visual areas , v1 and v2 , carry signals related to illusory contours , and that signals in v2 are more robust than in v1 ( @xcite , @xcite , reviews @xcite , @xcite ) . a more recent study on the tilt illusion , in which the perceived orientation of a grating differs from its physical orientation when surrounded by a tilted context , measured the activated connectivity in and between areas of early visual cortices ( @xcite ) .",
    "these findings suggest that for gois these areas may be involved as well .",
    "neurophysiology can help to provide a physical basis to phenomenological experience of gois opening to the possibility of mathematically modeling them and to integrate subjective and objective experiences .      the pioneering work of hoffman @xcite dealt with illusions of angle ( i.e. the ones involving the phenomenon of angular expansion , which is the tendence to perceive under certain conditions acute angles as larger and obtuse ones as smaller ) modeling the generated perceived curves as orbits of a lie transformation group acting on the plane .",
    "the proposed model allows to classify the perceptual invariance of the considered phenomena in terms of lie derivatives , and to predict the slope .",
    "another model mathematically equivalent to the one proposed by hoffman has been proposed by smith , @xcite , who stated that the apparent curve of geometrical optical illusions of angle can be modeled by a first - order differential equation depending on a single parameter . by computing this value an apparent curve",
    "can be corrected and plotted in a way that make the illusion being not perceived anymore ( see for example fig . 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "this permits to introduce a _ quantitative _ analysis of the perceived distortion .",
    "ehm and wackerman in @xcite , started from the assumption that gois depend on the context of the image which plays an active role in altering components of the figure . on this basis they provided a variational approach computing the deformed lines as minima of a functional depending on length of the curve and the deflection from orthogonality along the curve .",
    "this last request is in accordance to the phenomenological property of regression to right angle .",
    "one of the problems pointed out by the authors is that the approach does nt take into account the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms .",
    "an entire branch for modeling neural activity , the bayesian framework , had its basis in helmholtz s theory @xcite : _ our percepts are our best guess as to what is in the world , given both sensory data and prior experience . _",
    "the described idea of unconscious inference is at the basis of the bayesian statistical decision theory , a principled method for determining optimal performance in a given perceptual task ( @xcite ) .",
    "these methods consists in attributing a probability to each possible true state of the environment given the stimulus on the retina and then to establish the way prior experience influences the final guess , the built proximal stimulus ( see @xcite for examples of bayesian models in perception ) .",
    "an application of this theory to motion illusions has been provided by weiss et al in @xcite , and a review in @xcite .",
    "fermller and malm in @xcite attributed the perception of geometric optical illusions to the statistics of visual computations .",
    "noise ( uncertainty of measurements ) is the reason why systematic errors occur in the estimation of the features ( intensity of the image points , of positions of points and orientations of edge elements ) and illusions arise as results of errors due to quantization .",
    "walker ( @xcite ) tried to combine neural theory of receptive field excitation together with mathematical tools to provide an equation able to determine the disparity between the apparent line of an illusion and its corresponding actual line , in order to reproduce the perceptual errors that occur in gois ( the ones involving straight lines ) . in our model we aim to combine psycho - physical evidence and neurophysiological findings , in order to provide a neuro - mathematical model able to interpret and simulate gois .",
    "the visual process is the result of several retinic and cortical mechanisms which act on the visual signal .",
    "the retina is the first part of the visual system responsible for the trasmission of the signal , which passes through the lateral geniculate nucleus , where a pre - processing is performed and arrives in the visual cortex , where it is further processed .",
    "the receptive field ( rf ) of a cortical neuron is the portion of the retina which the neuron reacts to , and the receptive profile ( rp ) @xmath0 is the function that models the activation of a cortical neuron when a stimulus is applied to a point @xmath1 of the retinal plane .",
    "simple cells of visual cortices v1 and v2 are sensitive to position and orientation of the contrast gradient of an image .",
    "their properties have been experimentally described by de angelis in @xcite , see figure [ fig:2e ] . from the neurophysiological point of view the orientation selectivity ,",
    "the spatial and temporal frequency of cells in v2 differs little from the one in v1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "receptive fields in v2 are larger from those in v1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . considering a basic geometric model , the set of simple cells",
    "rps can be obtained via translations of vector @xmath2 and rotation of angle @xmath3 from a unique mother profile @xmath4 .",
    "daugman @xcite , jones and palmer @xcite showed that gabor filters were a good approximation for receptive profiles of simple cells in the primary visual cortices v1 and v2 .",
    "another approach is to model receptive profiles as gaussian derivatives , as introduced by young in @xcite and koenderink in @xcite , but for our purposes the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "a good expression for the mother gabor filter is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ratio between @xmath7 and the spatial wavelength of the cosine factor .",
    "translations and rotations can be expressed as : @xmath8 hence a general rp can be expressed as : @xmath9    a set of rps generated with equation [ group_law ] is shown in figure [ fig43332 ] .",
    "the retinal plane is identified with the @xmath10-plane , whose local coordinates will be denoted with @xmath11 . when a visual stimulus @xmath12 of intensity @xmath13 activates the retinal layer of photoreceptors , the neurons whose rfs intersect @xmath14 spike and their spike frequencies @xmath15 can be modeled ( taking into account just linear contributions ) as the integral of the signal @xmath16 with the set of gabor filters .",
    "the expression for this output is : @xmath17 in the right hand side of the equation the integral of the signal with the real and imaginary part of the gabor filter is expressed .",
    "the two families of cells have different shapes , hence they detect different features",
    ". in particular odd cells will be responsible for boundary detection .",
    "the term _ functional architecture _ refers to the organisation of cells in the primary visual cortex in structures .",
    "the hypercolumnar structure , discovered by the neuro - physiologists hubel and wiesel in the 60s ( @xcite ) , organizes the cells of v1/v2 in columns ( called hypercolums ) covering a small part of the visual field @xmath18 and corresponding to parameters such as orientation , scale , direction of movement , color , for a fixed retinal position @xmath19 .",
    "we have the set of all possible orientations , title=\"fig : \" ]   we have the set of all possible orientations , title=\"fig : \" ]    in our framework over each retinal point we will consider a whole hypercolumn of cells , each one sensitive to a specific instance of orientation . hence for each position @xmath19 of the retina @xmath18 we associate a whole set of filters @xmath20 this expression associates to each point of the proximal stimulus in @xmath10 all possible feature orientations into the space of features @xmath21 , and defines a fiber over each point @xmath22 in this way the hypercolumnar structure is described in terms of differential geometry , but we need to explain how the orientation selectivity is performed by the cortical areas in the space of feature @xmath23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "physiologically the orientation selectivity is the action of short range connections between simple cells belonging to the same hypercolumn to select the most probable response from the energy of receptive profiles .",
    "horizontal connections are long ranged and connect cells of approximately _ the same orientation_. since the connectivity between cells is defined on the tangent bundle , we define now the generator of this space .",
    "the change of variable defined through @xmath24 in acts on the basis for the tangent bundle @xmath25 giving as frame in polar coordinates : @xmath26 as presented in @xcite , the whole space of features @xmath27 is described in terms of a 3-dimensional fiber bundle , whose generators are @xmath28 , @xmath29 for the base and @xmath30 for the fiber .",
    "these vector fields generate the tangent bundle of @xmath31 .",
    "since horizontal connectivity is very anysotropic , the three generators are weighted by a strongly anysotropic metric .",
    "we introduce now the sub - riemannian metric with whom citti and sarti in @xcite proposed to endow the @xmath31 group to model the long range connectivity of the primary visual cortex v1 . starting from the vector fields @xmath28 , @xmath32 and @xmath29 we define a metric @xmath33 for which the inverse ( responsible for the connectivity in the cortex ) is :    @xmath34    with @xmath35 .",
    "cortical curves in v1 will be a linear combination of vector fields @xmath28 and @xmath32 , the generators of the 2-dimensional horizontal space , while they will have a vanishing component along @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the functional architectures built in @xmath31 correspond to the neural connectivity measured by angelucci et al . in @xcite and bosking et al . in @xcite . for a qualitatively and quantitative comparison between the kernels and the connectivity patterns",
    "see favali et al . in @xcite . in our work a local formulation of the kernel presented in @xcite will be used .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown by sanguinetti et al . in @xcite",
    "that the geometry of fuctional architecture formally introduced in [ sec:2 ] is naturally encoded in the statistics of natural images .",
    "hence these geometrical structures are compatible with bayesian learning methods .",
    "we consider simple cells at fixed value of @xmath7 depending on position and orientation . for fixed value of @xmath19 , we restrict the connectivity tensor @xmath37 to the @xmath10 plane , subset of the tangent plane to @xmath31 at the point @xmath27 , and obtain the tensor @xmath38 for every value of @xmath3 this tensor has only one non zero eigenvalue .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector has direction @xmath3 .",
    "we will assign to the norm of the output the usual meaning of energy @xmath39 where the output is defined in and is evaluated at the fixed value of @xmath7 .",
    "we will discuss in section [ sec:3 ] the choice of @xmath7 for our experiments .",
    "each point of the hypercolumn is weighted by the energy of simple cells normalized over the whole set of hypercolumn responses : @xmath40 the normalization of the output expresses the probability that a specific cell sensitive to @xmath3 within the hypercolumn over @xmath19 is selected .",
    "the mechanism of intracortical selection attributing a probability to each possible orientation ( state ) given the initial stimulus is connected to the long - range activity : simple cells belonging to different hypercolumns in a neighbourhood of a point @xmath19 sensitive to the same orientation will have a high probability .",
    "the connectivity tensor restricted to the @xmath10 plane and modulated by the output of simple cells will become : @xmath41 this last expression corresponds to a connectivity polarized by the normalized energy of simple cells shown in at points @xmath42 .",
    "the overall cometric ( inverse of the metric tensor ) arising from the action within the hypercolumn over each retinal point @xmath19 is obtained summing up along @xmath3 the previous modulated metric in and will have the following expression : @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a constant factor .",
    "this tensor will have principal eigenvector in the direction @xmath45 , the orientation corresponding to the maximum energy within the hypercolumn .",
    "a visualization of @xmath46 is given in figure [ her_fig ] .",
    "hence this process describes the selection at every point @xmath19 of the most likely direction of propagation of the connectivity , expressed by the values attained by the energy .    1.8 in    1.8 in    1.8 in    2.1 in    2.1 in    2.1 in      in the previous section we described the response of the cortex in the presence of a visual stimulus .",
    "* the distal stimulus is projected onto the cortex by means of activity of simple cells .    *",
    "the joint action of the short and long range connectivity induces a riemannian tensor @xmath46 on the @xmath10 retinal plane .    even though it is not completely clear in which cortical area the perceived image is reconstructed , from a phenomenological point of view it is evident that our visual system recostructs the perceived image .",
    "hence a third mechanism takes place , able to construct the perceived stimulus from the cortical activation . with this mechanism the image distortion which induces the metric tensor @xmath47 ( inverse of @xmath46 )",
    "is estimated . here",
    "we propose to apply infinitesimal strain theory and to identify its inverse @xmath47 with the strain tensor to compute the deformation .",
    "once the displacement vector field is applied to the distal stimulus , we obtain a distorted image which models the proximal one . in this way",
    "we justify the mechanism at the basis of geometrical optical illusions .    in this approach",
    "we consider the medium to be subjected only to small displacements , i.e. the geometry of the medium and its constitutive properties at each point of the space are assumed to be unchanged by deformation .",
    "the mathematical question is how to reconstruct the displacement starting from the strain tensor @xmath47 .",
    "we think at the deformation induced by a geometrical optical illusion as a map between the @xmath10 plane equipped with the metric @xmath47 and the @xmath10 plane with the euclidean metric @xmath48 : @xmath49 from the mathematical point of view this means that we look for the change of variable which induces the new metric , i.e. @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( see jost @xcite ) , obtaining the relation : @xmath52 let us notice @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath53 , the map representing the process which builds the modulated connectivity we discussed before . in strain theory",
    "@xmath47 satisfying is called _ right cauchy - green tensor _ associated to the deformation @xmath54 , which from the physical point of view is a map @xmath55 associating the points of the closure of a bounded open set @xmath56 ( initial configuration of a body ) to @xmath57 ( deformed configuration ) . for references",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is possible to introduce the displacement as a map @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "it follows @xmath60 we can now express the right cauchy - green tensor in terms of displacement : @xmath61 the concept of strain is used to evaluate how much a given displacement differs locally from a rigid body displacement .",
    "one of the strain tensors for large deformations is the so called _ green - lagrangian strain tensor or green - saint venant strain tensor _ defined as : @xmath62 which can be written in terms of the displacement as before : @xmath63 for _ infinitesimal deformations _ of a continuum body , in which the displacement gradient is small ( @xmath64 ) , it is possible to perform a geometric linearization of strain tensors introduced before , in which the non - linear second order terms are neglected .",
    "linearized green - saint venant tensor _ has the following form : @xmath65 which is used in the study of linearized elasticity , i.e. the study of such situations in which the displacements of the material particles of a body are assumed to be small ( as stated at the beginning , infinitesimal strain theory . )",
    "+ here we give the expression in components of @xmath66 :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 . expressing @xmath69 in terms of the metric @xmath70 with whom",
    "the initial configuration of the considered body was equipped we obtain : @xmath71 and in its matrix form : @xmath72",
    "starting from we obtain a system of equations with this form : @xmath73 differentiating , substituting and imposing neumann boundary conditions to system we end up with the following differential system : @xmath74 let us explicitly note that tensor @xmath47 is obtained after convolution of gabor filters , so that it is differentiable , allowing to write the system .",
    "hence we solve , recovering the displacement field @xmath75 .",
    "the inverse of tensor expressed in formula is computed discretizing @xmath3 as a vector of 32 values equally spaced in the interval @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath7 varies in dependence of the image resolution and is set in concordance with the stimulus processed .",
    "it is taken quite large in all examples in such a way to obtain a smooth tensor field covering all points of the image .",
    "this is in accordance with the hypothesis previously introduced that mechanisms in v2 , where the receptive field of simple cells is larger than in v1 , play a role in such phenomena .",
    "the constant @xmath77 has been chosen for all the examples as @xmath78 .",
    "the differential problem in is approximated with a central finite difference scheme and it is solved with a classical pde linear solver .",
    "we now start discussing all results obtained through the presented algorithm .",
