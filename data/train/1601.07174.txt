    "rotation - powered pulsars are known to produce relativistic magnetized winds responsible for a substantial fraction of the pulsar s spin - down energy loss .",
    "high angular resolution observations with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ cxo _ ) have shown that the winds are intrinsically anisotropic ( both polar and equatorial outflow components are often seen , with the latter dominating in most cases ; see kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ) .",
    "the outflow morphology is also influenced by the interaction with the ambient medium , which can introduce further anisotropy .",
    "the motion effects become particularly pronounced when the pulsar speed exceeds the sound speed in the ambient medium leading to the formation of a bow shock . in this case , the outflow from the pulsar is expected to acquire a cometary shape with an extended tail behind the pulsar .",
    "some examples of such outflows are the pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) associated with psrs b0355 + 54 ( mcgowan et al .",
    "2006 ) , j03573205 ( de luca et al .",
    "2010 ) , and j17412054 ( auchettl et al .  2015 ) .",
    "moreover , there has been growing evidence that pwne around high - speed pulsars ( such as psr b2224 + 65 , igr j110146103 ) exhibit puzzling elongated features in addition to cometary tails ( hui & becker 2007 ; pavan et al .",
    "2014 , 2015 ) . to understand the origin of the diverse morphologies of pulsar outflows and their interaction with ambient medium , deep x - ray observations with high spatial resolution are particularly valuable .",

    "the x - ray spectrum extracted from an @xmath15 aperture around the pulsar position was fitted with an absorbed pl model with a best - fit @xmath16 . since no x - ray pulsations could be detected ( because the 3.2 s frame time was much longer than the pulsar period )",

    "the merged image produced from four acis - i observations ( see figure [ image - raw ] ) reveals a bright cn around the pulsar ( 514 net source counts ) and two fainter large - scale elongated structures .",
    "in addition to the extended tail ( hereafter , southern outflow ; 3530 net counts ) previously reported by k+08 , the much deeper image shows , for the first time , another fainter structure ( hereafter , the northern outflow ; 1,760 net counts ) apparently originating from the pulsar / cn area and visible up to 7@xmath38 ( or 7.7 pc at @xmath39 kpc ) north of the pulsar . below we consider the individual pwn elements in detail .",
    "the inset in figure [ image - raw ] shows the cn structure .",
    "the peak of the x - ray brightness distribution ( r.a.=@xmath40 , decl.=@xmath41 ) coincides ( within @xmath42 ) with the radio position of the pulsar ( r.a.=@xmath43 , decl.=@xmath44 at mjd 51463 , i.e. , about 14 years before our x - ray observations ) .",
    "the centroiding uncertainty of the x - ray position , @xmath45 ( calculated by celldetect ) , is much smaller than the typical uncertainty of the _ chandra _ absolute astrometry ( @xmath46 at 68% confidence ) .",
    "this puts an upper limit of @xmath47 on the pulsar position shift during 14 years , corresponding to an upper limit @xmath48 mas yr@xmath2 on proper motion .",
    "the psf modeling and subtraction does not reveal any additional structure within the core region .",
    "we also attempted psf deconvolution using the ciao tool arestore , but it did not produce anything new .",
    "the rest of the cn structure bears much resemblance to the geminga pwn .",
    "therefore , following pavlov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we will call the three distinct features of the cn the lateral tails and the axial tail .",
    "the lateral tails are noticeably longer ( @xmath317@xmath49 , or 0.13@xmath500.18 pc at @xmath39 kpc ) than the axial tail ( @xmath313@xmath51 , or 0.05 pc at @xmath39 kpc ) .",
    "a wind from a fast - moving pulsar is expected to produce a termination shock with a bow - like ( parabolic ) structure ahead of the pulsar .",
    "however , we see no extended emission ahead of the point - like source at the leading tip of the cn ( see inset in figure 1 ) . to constrain the stand - off distance @xmath52 of the possible unresolved shock apex ahead of the pulsar",
    ", we assume that the shape of the lateral tails represent the shock surface , fit the shape with a parabola , and estimate @xmath52 as the distance between the vertex of the fitted parabola and the position of the brightness peak .",
    "this approach gave us only upper limits on the stand - off distance , @xmath5310 , depending on the region chosen for fitting .",
    "these fits , however , allowed us to estimate the radius of curvature at the parabola s vertex , @xmath54@xmath55 .",
    "examination of the cn images from individual observations suggests variability associated with the lateral tails .",
    "this variability might be caused by the motion of blobs moving along the tails ( see figure [ image - blobs - jets]kargaltsev/ + j1509movie.mov ] ) ] ) .",
    "to quantify the changes in the positions of the blobs ( shown with green and yellow ellipses in figure [ image - blobs - jets ] ) , we measure their positions ( relative to the pulsar ) in the images from four separate observations and plot them as a function of time in figure [ image - blobs - plot ] .",
    "the positions are measured by running ciao s tool celldetect values range between 0102 ) .",
    "therefore , we conservatively take the actual uncertainties to be 05 for all blobs and use these in the fits . ] .",
    "it is apparent from these plots that the green data points can be approximately connected by straight lines corresponding to steady motion .",
    "if we fit a steady motion model to the green data points ( omitting the others from the fitting procedure ) , the resulting blob speeds are @xmath56 for the western lateral tail and @xmath57 for the eastern lateral tail",
    ".    this result should be taken with some caution because the significance of the individual blobs in the individual observations is low , @xmath58 , when using a local background ( i.e. within the lateral outflows ) as calculated by celldetect ) .",
    "however , it increases to @xmath59@xmath60 when the external ( i.e. , outside the cn ) background region is used .",
    "moreover , under the assumption of steady motion , the same blob is seen in multiple observations and hence the combined blob significances increase to 3@xmath61 for the local background choice , and to @xmath62@xmath63 for the external background choice .",
    "we have also compared the merged image of the cn with the older observation ( obsid 3515 , acis - s , 2003 feb 9 ) .",
    "that observation was significantly shorter ( 40 ks ) , and the acis - s3 background contribution was much higher than that of the acis - i , making it difficult to resolve the individual components of the cn ( see figure 4 in k+08 ) .",
    "figure [ image - mid - scale ] shows the transition from the cn to the extended outflow south of the pulsar .",
    "one can see the lateral tails fading and apparently merging at @xmath3127@xmath51 from the pulsar . beyond this distance",
    "the flow expands in the transverse direction and gives rise to the fainter _ southern outflow _ seen in figure [ image - large - scale ] that presents the merged image of the large - scale diffuse emission with field point sources subtracted and exposure - map correction applied .",
    "unexpectedly , the same image clearly reveals a similarly shaped emission north - northwest of the pulsar , although this _ northern outflow _ is not discernible in the pulsar vicinity ( figure [ image - mid - scale ] ) .",
    "the shapes of both large - scale structures , extending up to @xmath64 from the pulsar , can be crudely described as two wedges with @xmath65 opening angles and tips at ( or near ) the pulsar position .",
    "the southern outflow is approximately aligned with the cn symmetry axis , while the northern outflow is inclined to the cn symmetry axis by @xmath66",
    ". although the sizes and shapes of these outflows are similar , the distributions of surface brightness within the two structures are markedly different .",
    "the averaged ( over the transverse direction ) surface brightness of the southern outflow ( see figure [ image - radio ] for the profile extraction regions ) appears to decrease almost linearly with distance from the pulsar ( see figure [ figure - tail - brightness ] ) , while the averaged surface brightness of the northern outflow does not appear to change significantly over its length ( shown in figure [ figure - headlight - brightness ] ) .",
    "moreover , a substantially brighter region ( hereafter referred to as the `` spine '' ) is clearly seen within the southern outflow up to @xmath67 from the pulsar , while no such a feature is seen in the northern outflow .",
    "figure [ image - radio ] also shows the extended radio emission reported by ng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which stretches along the southern outflow .",
    "it becomes wider than the x - ray outflow beyond @xmath68 from the pulsar and then narrows down again beyond @xmath69 .",
    "the radio outflow is seen up to @xmath70 from of the pulsar , whereas the visible southern x - ray outflow becomes comparable with the background at about @xmath3 from the pulsar .",
    "no radio emission is seen from the northern outflow region in the same atca observation .",
    "we measure the cn spectra in three regions shown in the figure [ image - raw ] inset : ( 1 ) the bright pulsar / head region ( within the @xmath71 radius white circle around the pulsar ) , which contains an unresolved cn `` head '' in addition to the pulsar , ( 2 ) the lateral tails ( cyan polygons ) , and ( 3 ) the axial tail ( the green polygon ) .",
    "for the southern outflow , we define the following regions ( shown in figure [ image - large - scale ] ) : the entire southern outflow ( combination of green polygons ) , the spine ( magenta polygon ) , and the southern outflow excluding the spine .",
    "we also divide the entire southern outflow region into 4 segments , with segment 1 being the closest to the pulsar and segment 4 being the farthest . for the northern outflow , we define two regions : the proximal and distal halves ( cyan polygons ) .",
    "we fit all spectra with an absorbed pl model ( unless specified otherwise ) and list the fitting parameters table [ spatially - resolved - spectra ] . for all regions , the spectra from different observations",
    "are fitted simultaneously , with the all parameters being tied together .",
    "fitting the spine of the southern outflow yields an absorbing column density @xmath72 @xmath9 and a photon index @xmath73 , with reduced chi - squared @xmath74 for @xmath75 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) .",
    "since the spectrum from this region fits the pl model well , and has a relatively small background contribution and a good statistic , we fix @xmath76 at the best - fit value obtained for this region while fitting the spectra from other regions which have poorer statistics by fitting the spectra from the lateral tails and the pulsar / head region . ] .    for the cn regions",
    ", we obtained very similar pl slopes for the pulsar / head and the lateral tails ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively ) while the axial tail appears to have a harder spectrum ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "it is plausible that a substantial fraction of the pulsar / head emission comes from the neutron star and hence it may have a thermal component .",
    "therefore , we attempted to fit the pulsar / head spectrum with a pl + blackbody ( bb ) model ( with a fixed bb radius of 12 km ) .",
    "this resulted in a slightly better fit , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 ev , and @xmath82 for 53 d.o.f .",
    "however , the best - fit bb+pl model is preferred over the pl model at a 93% ( @xmath83 ) confidence , according to the f - test ( i.e. , the bb component is not required by the data ) .",
    "we find an upper limit on the neutron star surface temperature by gradually increasing the temperature of the bb component ( and re - fitting the pl component at each new temperature chosen ) until the model becomes inconsistent with the data at a @xmath59 confidence level .",
    "this yields an upper limit @xmath84 ev ( or @xmath85 k ) .",
    "although the quality of the fits is good for all the cn regions ( see table [ spatially - resolved - spectra ] ) , the fits of the pulsar / head spectrum ( see figure [ image - psr - spectra ] ) shows some systematic residuals centered at 3.5 kev ( between 3.33.6 kev ) . to examine plausibility of the alleged spectral feature",
    ", we jointly fit the _ xmm - newton _",
    "spectra from two observations ( see figure [ image - xmm - psr - spectra ] ) extracted from circular regions ( @xmath86 and @xmath33 for the pn and mos detectors ; see section 2 ) centered on the pulsar with the absorbed pl model and @xmath76 fixed at the same value as for the acis spectral fits .",
    "this gave a similar spectral slope , @xmath87 , but a hint of an emission feature at @xmath88 kev is seen in the pn spectrum from only one observation while the pn spectrum from the other observation shows a hint of absorption , which means that the feature is likely a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the mos spectra do not have enough counts to look for spectral features .",
    "the spectrum of the spine ( @xmath73 ) appears somewhat softer than that of the rest of the southern outflow ( @xmath89 ) . for the southern outflow segments 14 , we obtain @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "we do not see any systematic softening of the spectrum along the southern emission despite its large extent ; rather there is a hint of hardening from segment 2 to 4 .",
    "almost all fits are of good quality ( the poorest quality fit , @xmath94 for 46 d.o.f . , being for segment 1 , its spectrum is shown in figure [ image - tail - seg-1-spectra ] ) .",
    "the slope of the spectrum for the entire northern outflow ( @xmath95 ) is similar to the spectrum of the southern outflow excluding the spine ( @xmath89 ) although , unlike the southern outflow , the northern outflow spectrum shows a hint of softening with increasing distance from the pulsar ( @xmath96 changes from @xmath97 to @xmath98 ) .",
    "this may explain the somewhat poorer quality of the pl fit to the spectrum of the entire northern outflow ( see table [ spatially - resolved - spectra ] ) .",

    "therefore , for a jet with the angular width @xmath195 , a significant bending on a scale of the observed curvature radius @xmath54@xmath55 ( see section 3.1.1 ) implies that most of the spin - down power goes into the two jets .",
    "however , observations of pwne with both jet and equatorial components suggest @xmath196 ( e.g. , kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ; pavlov et al .  2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the jet interpretation of the lateral tails would imply that in some pulsars jets can be more powerful than equatorial outflows .",
    "more extensive modeling and simulations are needed to see whether it is possible to reproduce the observed cn morphologies for other assumptions on the angular distribution of the pulsar wind injection .",
    "we also note that the morphologies of the geminga and j1509 cne are markedly different from those of other bow - shock pwne .",
    "in particular , others exhibit a cn with a local minimum in brightness in the pulsar vicinity ( i.e. , behind the pulsar ; pwne of psrs j0357 + 3205 and j11016101 ) , or exhibit a filled cn morphology ( pwne of psrs j17472958 , j17412054 , and b0355 + 54 ) . the differences , however , are not limited to x - ray morphologies only .",
    "for instance , the radio counterparts of the pwne associated with psrs j15095850 ( ng et al .  2010 ) , j11016101 ( pavan et al .",
    "2014 ) , and j17472958 ( the mouse ; yusef - zadeh & gaensler 2005 ) , the radio brightness distributions are also quite different . while the radio brightness in the mouse is maximal near the pulsar ( similar to x - rays ; gaensler et al .",
    "2004 ) , in the other two pwne the radio brightness is low near the pulsar and becomes higher further away ( see figure [ image - radio ] ) .",
    "we also note that the x - ray morphologies of most of the other cne in figure [ bowshocks ] do not bear much resemblance to the simulated images , except perhaps for the mouse and j17412054 .",
    "ng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) mentioned an open cluster , ruprecht 112 ( c1453623 ; alter et al .",
    "1970 ) , about 4@xmath197 southwest of the current pulsar position , as a possible birth place of the pulsar . at the distance of 3.8 kpc and",
    "the pulsar s spin - down age of 150 kyr , the required pulsar velocity would be @xmath198 km s@xmath2 , much higher than the upper limit of 640 km s@xmath2 on the transverse velocity inferred from the lack of detectable change of the pulsar position in 14 years . based on the comparison of the older x - ray image with the shape of the termination shock `` bullet '' seen in numerical simulations , k+08 suggested that the pulsar velocity should be @xmath199 km s@xmath2 , which is still within the allowed velocity range ( see above ) .",
    "however , since the deeper x - ray images reveal substantial differences between the cn structure and the simulations , this velocity estimate should be taken with caution .",
    "the most puzzling new feature of the j1509 pwn is the large - scale northern outflow seen up to @xmath200 almost ahead of the pulsar .",
    "one could assume that the northern outflow is a powerful relativistic jet piercing the bow shock near the pulsar .",
    "the lack of a counter - jet could be explained by doppler boosting , but there are other problems with the jet interpretation . according to the estimates in section 4.1.1 , the bending length for a jet is very small , even at @xmath201 and @xmath202 , compared to the length of the northern outflow that shows no bending .",
    "it is also difficult to explain the relative faintness of the northern outflow closer to the pulsar ( but outside the cn ) in the jet scenario .",
    "finally , the x - ray radiation efficiency of the northern outflow , @xmath203 , substantially exceeds the efficiencies of jets of younger pwne with clear torus - jet morphology .",
    "therefore , we discard the jet interpretation for the northern outflow .",
    "similar arguments have led bandiera ( 2008 ) to conclude that the extended x - ray feature accompanying the guitar nebula ( which also exhibits a large - scale outflow misaligned with the pulsar motion direction ; see figure [ image - guitar ] and johnson & wang 2010 ) can not be interpreted as a hydrodynamical jet .",
    "following bandiera ( 2008 ) , we consider a scenario in which particles with the highest energies leak from the termination shock apex into the ism , and travel along the ordered ism magnetic field .",
    "bandiera ( 2008 ) suggested that the length of the guitar pwn feature , @xmath204 pc , is on the order of the radiation length ( i.e. , the distance over which particles lose a substantial fraction of their energy to synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "however , this assumption implies a propagation speed of only a few thousands km s@xmath2 , instead of the speed of light , as expected for particles with large ( bulk ) lorentz factors .",
    "bandiera ( 2008 ) argued that the turbulent component of the magnetic field would provide a scattering mechanism and slow down particle propagation ( which can then be considered as diffusion ) along the ism magnetic field to the required non - relativistic speed .",
    "the observed hint of softening of the x - ray spectrum in j1509 s northern outflow can be considered as supporting this scenario .",
    "a problem with this scenario is that in all three cases with prominent misaligned ( with respect to pulsar motion ) x - ray features ( the guitar , j1509 , and j11016101 ) , the features appear to be one - sided or show very faint `` counter - features '' , which means that there is a preferred direction for the escape of the high - energy particles .",
    "the cause of this asymmetry is currently unclear . on the other hand ,",
    "since the particles escaping from the termination shock apex into the ism must be the most energetic ones ( those with large gyration radii ; see bandiera 2008 ) , the lack of radio synchrotron emission can be naturally explained by the deficit of lower energy particles .",
    "the southern outflow is aligned with the cn symmetry axis and clearly represents a continuation of the cn ( see figure [ image - mid - scale ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can assume that at least the brighter part of the southern outflow can be interpreted as a tail filled with the shocked pulsar wind confined by the ram pressure .",
    "the lack of evidence for synchrotron burn - off in the x - ray spectra suggests a high flow speed and/or a low magnetic field .",
    "alternatively , there could be some `` reheating '' due to in - situ conversion of magnetic field energy into particle energy , e.g. , via turbulent processes and accompanying reconnection , which might explain the hint of spectral hardening at large distances from the pulsar ( see figure [ image - gamma - fn - dist ] . ) indeed , ng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported the presence of substantial turbulent magnetic field components in the tail using radio polarimetry data .",
    "there are , however , some puzzling aspects associated with the southern outflow .",
    "one is that the radio emission brightens with distance from the pulsar and becomes broader than the x - ray emission beyond @xmath68 ( see figure [ image - radio ] ) .",
    "such behavior could possibly be caused by entrainment of ambient matter ( see also morlino et al .",
    "2015 ) , which decreases the flow speed , increases the transverse size of the tail , and leads to adiabatic cooling of the outflowing matter .",
    "this tentative explanation remains to be checked with detailed modeling of entrainment effects .",
    "another puzzling aspect is the similarity of the wedge - like shapes of the fainter part of the southern outflow ( i.e. , the southern outflow excluding the spine ) and the northern outflow .",
    "given the qualitative differences in the above interpretations of the northern and southern outflows , these similarities could be attributed to merely a chance coincidence . alternatively , the structural and spectral similarities could be explained if both the northern emission and the southern emission ( excluding the spine ) are caused by very energetic particles that leaked from the termination shock apex in opposite directions and diffused along the curved ism magnetic field ( the curvature of the magnetic field is required to explain the different orientations of the `` wedges '' ) . in this scenario , the spine ( whose spectrum is slightly softer than that of the rest of the southern outflow ) is still interpreted as the pulsar tail , coincidentally projected onto the sky within the southern outflow .",
    "this interpretation may look somewhat artificial , but it can not be firmly excluded with the currently available data .",
    "the spectra of the large - scale outflows measured in several regions allow one to crudely estimate magnetic fields in these regions . for a pl synchrotron spectrum with photon index @xmath96 , the magnetic field at a given magnetization parameter @xmath205 ( ratio of energy densities of magnetic field and relativistic electrons )",
    "depends on the ratio of the luminosity @xmath206 , measured in the @xmath207 frequency range , to the radiating volume @xmath208 .",
    "a simple generalization of equation ( 7.14 ) in pacholczyk ( 1970 ) ( which minimizes the total energy density @xmath209 ) and assumes @xmath210 and @xmath211 . ] to the case of arbitrary @xmath61 gives @xmath212^{2/7}. \\label{synch_magn_field}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath213 and @xmath214 are the characteristic synchrotron frequencies ( @xmath215 ) corresponding to the boundary energies ( @xmath216 and @xmath217 ) of the electron spectrum ( @xmath218 ; @xmath219 ) , and @xmath220 .",
    "the photon indices and 0.58 kev luminosities have been measured from the spectral fits ( see table [ spatially - resolved - spectra ] ) .",

    "the exact value of @xmath214 is not really important as long as @xmath224 , so we choose a plausible ( but arbitrary ) value @xmath225 kev .",
    "the unknown frequency @xmath213 is the main source of uncertainty of the magnetic field at a given @xmath61 , for the measured spectral slopes . for the southern outflow",
    ", we can at least estimate a lower limit on @xmath213 from the requirement that extrapolation of the x - ray pl spectrum to lower frequencies does not exceed the harder radio spectrum ( @xmath226 ; ng et al .",
    "2010 ) , but even the limit , @xmath227@xmath228 hz , is not very certain because of the uncertainty of the x - ray photon indices ( and because the slope of the radio spectrum was measured in a broader region ) .",
    "since the northern outflow was not detected in the radio , we can only guess that @xmath213 is higher there than in the southern outflow ( which would be consistent with our hypothesis that the northern outflow emission is due to leaked particles with very high energies ) .",
    "given these uncertainties , we estimate the magnetic fields assuming @xmath229 ghz for all the regions . if future multiwavelength observations yield different estimates of @xmath213 , the magnetic field could be scaled ( approximately ) as @xmath230 ( if @xmath224 ) .",
    "the equipartition magnetic fields , @xmath231 , for different parts of the j1509 southern and northern outflows are given in table [ b - fields ] , for the above - described choice of boundary frequencies and @xmath39 kpc .",
    "although the actual magnetic field strengths can differ from those in table [ b - fields ] by a factor of a few , we can at least hope that their relative values reflect the spatial dependence of the magnetic field in the emitting regions .",
    "surprisingly , the magnetic field in the southern outflow shows a hint of non - monotonic dependence on distance from the pulsar : the field grows from segment 1 to segment 2 , and then decreases outwards ( in concert with the photon index @xmath96 and slope @xmath232 of electron spectrum ) .",
    "the reason for such behavior is unclear , and we can not exclude that it is simply due to a variation of unknown parameters ( e.g. , @xmath213 and/or @xmath61 along the outflow ) .    since the southern outflow was detected in radio ( ng et al .",
    "2010 ) , the radio spectrum ( @xmath233 ) can also be used for magnetic field estimates .",
    "if the radio and x - ray spectra are generated in different regions ( e.g. , the radio emission comes from a `` sheath '' around an x - ray emitting `` spine '' of the outflow ) , the magnetic field in the radio - emitting region should be estimated solely from the radio spectrum , which gives @xmath234 @xmath235 g for @xmath236 erg s@xmath2 , @xmath237 @xmath238 , @xmath239 mhz , @xmath240 ghz ( @xmath241 is the magnetization in this region ) .",
    "this value of @xmath242 is close to those determined from the x - ray spectra in segments 3 and 4 ( assuming @xmath243 ) .",
    "if the radio spectrum in the x - ray detected part of the southern outflow is generated in the same region as the x - ray emission , then the mutiwavelength ( radio to x - rays ) spectrum can be considered as a broken pl .",

    "the difference of the equipartition fields in the two segments of the northern outflow is within the @xmath246 uncertainties caused by the uncertainties of the spectral slopes . the characteristic equipartition field , @xmath24710 @xmath235 g , is lower than typical values for the southern outflow value higher than 100 ghz for the northern outflow . ] . however",
    ", if the x - ray emission from the northern outflow is indeed due to particles of very high energy leaked from the termination shock apex , then @xmath61 can be very different from unity , and @xmath248 very different from @xmath246 .",

    "the most important findings from our deep acis - i observations of j1509 can be summarized as follows .",
    "we were able to resolve the fine structure of the cn in the immediate pulsar vicinity .",
    "the cn consists of two lateral tails , apparently emerging from the pulsar and resolved up to 0.2 pc behind the pulsar , and a short , 0.05 pc , axial tail along the cn symmetry axis .",
    "the cn structure and size are remarkably similar to those of the geminga , pwn but different from several other bow shock pwne .",
    "such pwn morphology challenges the existing numerical simulations of synchrotron emission from the pwne of supersonically moving pulsars .",
    "the morphological differences from other pwne could be attributed to different initial wind magnetizations or , more likely , to anisotropic wind ejection , which affects the geometry of the magnetic field downstream of the termination shock and the pwn morphology .",
    "we found that the cn narrows beyond 0.20.3 pc , reaching the minimum width ( where the lateral tails apparently merge ) at about 0.5 pc behind the pulsar . beyond this distance the flow expands and forms the diverging 7 pc long southern outflow , discovered by k+08 who interpreted it as a tail of shocked pulsar wind confined by the ram pressure of the ambient medium .",
    "the pl spectra of the southern outflow do not show softening ( synchrotron cooling ) with increasing distance from the pulsar , which is expected for such long tails .",
    "the lack of softening ( with a hint of hardening ) may suggest that particle acceleration occurs within the tail .",
    "we also discovered a previously undetected wedge - like northern outflow , seen up to about 6 pc , with the wedge axis inclined at an angle of about @xmath280 from the pulsar s proper motion direction , inferred from the cn symmetry axis .",
    "this outflow is possibly formed by energetic pulsar wind particles escaping from the apex of the bow shock and diffusing along the ism magnetic field .",
    "the equipartion magnetic field in this outflow is about a few @xmath235 g , the flow speed is a few thousand km s@xmath2 , and the energy injection rate is @xmath281 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the discovery of the northern outflow puts j1509 into the ( so far ) small group of supersonically moving pulsars with misaligned outflows ( i.e. , outflows inclined to the pulsar trajectory at substantial angles ) . to better understand the nature of the misaligned outflows , further deep multiwavelength observations with high angular resolution are needed .",
