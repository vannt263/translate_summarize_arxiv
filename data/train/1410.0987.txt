    "over the past decade , the technique of manipulating ultracold atomic fermi gases has been well developed and it offers a physical reality to pursue an exotic pairing mechanism , which is referred to as fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states @xcite and has attracted impressive attentions in different physical areas @xcite . in spin - imbalanced fermi gases , the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing is not favorable against the fflo pairing with a finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "although there is no unambiguous experimental conclusion for the fflo superfluidity , strong evidence has been seen in a fermi cloud of @xmath4li atoms confined in quasi - one - dimensional harmonic traps near a crossover from a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) to a bcs superfluid @xcite .",
    "the fflo pairing is also favored by spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "motivated by the recent experimental realization of a synthetic spin - orbit coupling with equal weight combination of rashba and dresselhaus components @xcite , ff superfluidity - a specific form of the fflo superfluidity - has been theoretically investigated in spin - orbit coupled atomic fermi gases @xcite . in the case of a rasbha spin - orbit coupling , topological superfluidity",
    "is argued to be achievable @xcite , although the underlying pairing is of _ s_-wave character .",
    "it turns out that the topological superfluidity and ff superfluidity are compatible . as a result ,",
    "novel topological ff superfluids have also been proposed @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in a recent letter , some of us have predicted that a _ gapless _",
    "topological ff superfluid may appear in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin - orbit coupled atomic fermi gas with both in - plane and out - of - plane zeeman fields @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide more details about such an interesting superfluid phase and to discuss its thermodynamic stability by considering the superfluid density and superfluid transition temperature .",
    "it is well known that at finite temperatures the superfluidity of 2d atomic fermi gases is characterized by the vortex - antivortex ( v - av ) binding .",
    "the relevant mechanism is the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition occurring at a characteristic temperature @xmath5 @xcite . below the critical bkt temperature , a v - av binding state has a lower free energy and hence superfluidity emerges .",
    "the bkt transition was theoretically investigated long time ago in a 2d fermionic system without spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "following the recent experimental advances , there have been several theoretical investigations about the superfluid density and critical bkt temperature in 2d spin - orbit coupled fermi gases with bcs pairing @xcite . in the case of a large out - of - plane zeeman field , the temperature region for experimentally observing topological bcs superfluids and related majorana fermions has been discussed @xcite .",
    "however , the bkt physics of a spin - orbit coupled ff superfluid - which can be either gapped or gapless , topologically trivial or non - trivial - has so far not been addressed .    in this work , we explore this interesting issue and study the superfluid density tensor and bkt transition of a 2d rasbha spin - orbit coupled fermi gas in the presence of both in - plane and out - of - plane zeeman fields . by calculating the superfluid density tensor",
    ", we obtain the superfluid phase stiffness as functions of the temperature , spin - orbit coupling strength , binding energy ( that characterizes the interatomic interaction strength ) , in - plane and out - of - plane zeeman fields .",
    "this allows us to determine the critical bkt temperature of the system in four different ff superfluid phases @xcite , with a given set of parameters .",
    "our main results may be summarized as follows : ( i ) at zero temperature with an applied in - plane zeeman field in the _",
    "x_-direction , the component @xmath1 of the superfluid density tensor always changes discontinuously when the system continuously evolves from a gapped ff into a gapless ff phase .",
    "the component @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 except for a narrow parameter space where the ff momentum is sufficiently large .",
    "the two components of the superfluid density tensor decrease monotonically as the temperature increases .",
    "( ii ) all the four ff superfluid phases have significant critical bkt temperature , except for the parameter region with very small spin - orbit coupling and/or binding energy , or with very large in - plane and/or out - of - plane zeeman fields .",
    "the critical bkt temperature can be enhanced by increasing the binding energy .",
    "but it does not increase monotonically as the spin - orbit coupling strength increases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the mean - field theoretical framework , and clarify the bkt physics in two dimensions and the related kosterlitz - thouless - nelson ( kt - nelson ) criterion for phase transition .",

    "these results should be regarded as finite - temperature phase diagrams , as they show clearly which kind of superfluid phases is preferable when temperature decreases . in the curves , we use different colors to distinguish different _ emerging _ superfluid phases : green for the gff phase , red for the nff phase , blue for the tnff phase and finally yellow for the tgff phase .",
    "it is clear that all the four ff superfluid phases have significant critical bkt temperature except for the parameter regime with very small binding energy @xmath15 and/or spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath16 , or with very large in - plane zeeman field @xmath7 and/or out - of - plane zeeman field @xmath8 .",
    "( a ) or the in - plane zeeman field @xmath7 ( b).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the critical bkt temperature @xmath78 always increases monotonically with increasing the binding energy @xmath15 , as the pairing and superfluidity are enhanced at strong interatomic interactions .",
    "the binding energy is the dominant factor in forming cooper pairs . with a small binding energy ,",
    "the system is mainly of fermionic character . on the contrary , with a sufficiently large binding energy , the system tends to act as a gas of bosons .",
    "therefore , with increasing the binding energy up to some points , the system would lose its fermionic character near the bec - bcs crossover ( i.e. , @xmath152 ) and hence should become topologically trivial .",
    "indeed , at large binding energy we observe that the system always approaches the topologically trivial gff phase . the topological phase ,",
    "either gapless ( tnff in blue ) or gapped ( tgff in yellow ) , is favored at small binding energy , where the critical bkt temperature is lower .",
    "nevertheless , we find that by suitably tuning the parameters , it is possible to have a gapless topological tnff phase with a sizable critical bkt temperature @xmath153 for the binding energy up to @xmath154 ( see , for example , the dot - dashed line at the bottom of fig . [ fig5](a ) ) .",
    "this temperature is clearly within the reach in current cold - atom experiments @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the critical bkt temperature decreases monotonically with increasing the zeeman field , either in - plane or out - of - plane , as shown in fig .",
    "it is readily seen that with decreasing temperature the system would first turn into either the tnff or tgff phase at sufficiently large in - plane zeeman field @xmath7 or out - of - plane field @xmath8 , respectively . while at low zeeman fields , the topologically trivial gff phase is preferable .",
    "this agrees the observation we made in discussing the low - temperature phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     at different binding energies ( a ) , in - plane zeeman fields ( b ) and out - of - plane zeeman fields ( c ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    it is worth noting that , one may use the binding energy dependence or the zeeman field dependence of the critical bkt temperature to identify different emerging superfluid phases .",
    "this is particularly clear for the gapless tnff and nff phases , as the curvature of the @xmath78 curve for those phases behaves quite differently . for the tnff phase ,",
    "the curve is concave ; while for the nff phase , it is convex .",
    "this change in curvature ( i.e , from concave to convex ) seems to be related to the local minimum in the superfluid density component @xmath1 that we have reported earlier in fig . [ fig3 ] .",
    "we now discuss the critical bkt temperature as a function of the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath16 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . compared with the binding energy dependence and zeeman field dependence ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath78 on the spin - orbit coupling strength is non - monotonic and the emerging superfluid phases can re - appear with increasing the coupling strength .",
    "therefore , the @xmath78 curve is more subtle to understand .",
    "nevertheless , we may identify that the topologically trivial gff superfluid phase tends to be favorable at large spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this is because the pairing gap is usually enhanced by the spin - orbit coupling , which makes the topological phase transition much more difficult to occur ( cf . eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpt ] ) ) . at small spin - orbit coupling , on the other hand",
    ", the critical bkt temperature may dramatically decrease to zero , particularly at a small binding energy and/or a large zeeman field .",
    "thus , for the purpose of observing the gapless topological tnff phase , experimentally it seems better to use an intermediate spin - orbit coupling strength , i.e. , @xmath155 .",
    "in summary , we have presented a systematic investigation of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition in a spin - orbit coupled atomic fulde - ferrell superfluid in two dimensions .",
    "we have calculated the superfluid density and superfluid transition temperature of various fulde - ferrell superfluids .",
    "we have paid special attention to an interesting gapless topological fulde - ferrell superfluid and have clarified that , by suitably tuning the external parameters - for example , the interatomic interaction strength , in - plane and out - of - plane zeeman fields , and spin - orbit coupling strength - its observation is within the reach in current cold - atom experimental setups .",
    "our investigation is based on the mean - field theoretical framework , which is supposed to be applicable to a weakly interacting two - dimensional fermi gas ( i.e. , the binding energy @xmath156 ) . for a more reliable and quantitative description , in future studies it would be useful to take into account the strong phase fluctuations by using many - body _",
