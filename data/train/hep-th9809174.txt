    "the conjectured correspondence between the string theory in an anti de sitter ( ads ) space and the conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary opens up a new possibility of studying the conformal phase of the yang - mills theory via the analysis of supergravity , which , in many cases , is a useful low energy approximation of the string theory @xcite @xcite @xcite . from this point of view ,",
    "one natural case of interest is the large @xmath4 , near - horizon geometry of the @xmath5-threebranes of the type iib string theory . in this case , by the ads / cft correspondence , one relates the four - dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theory on the boundary of the @xmath1 to the bulk @xmath1 iib supergravity .",
    "one ultimately hopes to understand the dynamics of the gauge theory when the supersymmetry of the four - dimensional yang - mills theory is broken .",
    "a practical path toward this goal was suggested by witten @xcite as follows .",
    "instead of considering the asymptotically globally @xmath1 , one considers the asymptotically locally @xmath1 whose asymptotic geometry allows a non - trivial one - cycle . on the boundary yang - mills theory side ,",
    "one assigns the anti - periodic boundary condition for the fermions around the one - cycle .",
    "this choice of the boundary condition breaks the supersymmetry by making relevant scalars and fermions massive , resulting a non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory . on the gravity side , in the spirit of the ads / cft correspondence , therefore",
    ", we are led to consider the asymptotically locally @xmath1 supergravity whose asymptotic geometry contains a circle . in other words ,",
    "the asymptotic geometry of the five - dimensional manifolds that we are interested in should look like @xmath6 , where the first @xmath7 denotes a generic time , @xmath8 is the circle along which a non - trivial holonomy for fermions can be imposed , and @xmath9 is a two - manifold is orthogonal to @xmath9 . ] .",
    "recalling that the original gauge theory contained sixteen supercharges , we suppose that @xmath9 is a riemann surface .",
    "we thus consider the case when @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary riemann surface with genus @xmath12 ; on the yang - mills theory side , this results the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory in a space - time whose space - like hypersurface is a genus @xmath12 riemann surface upon the compactification on the @xmath8 .",
    "horowitz and myers recently raised the issue of the stability of the asymptotically locally @xmath1 supergravity asking the question of validity of the positive energy conjecture @xcite . when combined with the ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "the instability on the supergravity side , if it exists , will either imply the instability of the non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory or cast some doubts on the exactness of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "in fact , the positive energy theorem was proved for space - times whose asymptotic geometry is globally @xmath1 , consistent with the stability of the supersymmetric yang - mills theory with sixteen supercharges @xcite . however , in the context of the asymptotically locally flat space - time geometries , there are some explicit examples that show the existence of the regular solutions of the einstein equations whose energy is zero @xcite or not bounded from below @xcite @xcite . in a similar vein ,",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the positive energy conjecture fails for the asymptotically locally euclidean space - time . despite these aspects of the general relativity with the vanishing cosmological constant ,",
    "the intriguing conjecture of horowitz and myers is that the negative energy solution of @xcite , @xmath1 solitons , is the lowest energy solution among the possible asymptotically locally @xmath1 solutions of the @xmath1 iib supergravity , i.e. , essentially a positive energy conjecture .    in this paper",
    ", we find an evidence that supports the horowitz - myers conjecture ; we obtain the general solutions of the iib supergravity compactified on a five - sphere whose five - dimensional metric is of the form @xmath13 , which include the static genus one sector of the space - times introduced in the above .",
    "we find that the ads solitons ( negative energy ) of @xcite and ads black holes ( positive energy ) of @xcite are the unique regular solutions whose asymptotic geometry is locally @xmath1 , while all other solutions with the same asymptotic geometry possess naked singularities that show up in the square of the riemann tensor @xmath14 .",
    "our results span all the static , radial - dependent solutions of the genus one sector satisfying the asymptotic condition ; since propagating gravity wave degrees of freedom are expected to contribute a positive amount to the energy and since the perturbative analysis of @xcite proves that the @xmath1 solitons are local minimum of the energy , our results suggest that the @xmath1 solitons are the minimum energy solution when we consider the space - time geometries whose asymptotic spatial part of the metric is a product of a circle and a riemann surface of genus one , i.e. , a two - torus . in section",
    "ii , we start by reviewing the spontaneous compactification of the iib supergravity on a five - sphere ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) , which is the near - horizon geometry of the @xmath5-threebrane solutions @xcite . in section iii , we explicitly solve the equations of motion to get the general solutions of the form introduced in the above .",
    "in section iv , we show that the @xmath1 solitons and black holes are the unique regular solutions .",
    "in fact , the solution space is parameterized by points on @xmath15 and , at a fixed radius of the solution space , the @xmath1 solitons and the @xmath1 black holes are two points on a solution space circle at which naked singularities are absent .",
    "we conclude by discussing the cases of an arbitrary genus and , especially , the most interesting case of the genus zero for the test of the horowitz - myers conjecture .",
    "we start from the following action from the iib supergravity @xmath16 , \\label{10action}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the dilaton field , @xmath18 is the rr self - dual five - form field strength and @xmath19 , the ten - dimensional metric .",

    "the metric @xmath26 is the standard metric on the unit @xmath0 with five angle coordinates @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . imposing the spherical symmetry on @xmath0",
    "requires that the dilaton field depends only on the @xmath25 coordinates .",
    "in addition , it is necessary that the five - form field strength be the scalar on the @xmath0 or be proportional to the pseudoscalar @xmath32 , the volume form on the unit five - sphere .",
    "thus , the five - form field strength @xmath18 has nonvanishing components @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a zero - form field strength on the @xmath23 . the integration on the @xmath0 after plugging in the fields into eq .",

    "( [ 5action ] ) , we additionally used an equivalent but more convenient description of the five - form field strength @xmath39 by taking the five - dimensional hodge dual of the @xmath39 .",
    "namely , we take the hodge dual transformation via @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the zero - form field strength on the @xmath23 . at level of the action",
    ", this transformation also dictates that the term @xmath42 changes to @xmath43 to implement hodge duality , which ensures that the equations of motion on the @xmath23 are equivalent in both case .",
    "we notice that the equations of motion for the five - form field strength become the bianchi identities in the dual picture .",
    "just as the bianchi identities for the five - form field strength in five dimensions are vacuous , the equations of motion for the zero - form field strength are vacuous .    the bianchi identities for the zero - form field strengths @xmath35 and @xmath41 imply that they are constants .",
    "the self - duality of the rr five - form field strength furthermore gives a constraint @xmath44 .",
    "for the spontaneous compactification on the @xmath0 where the ten - dimensional space - time is the direct product of a five - manifold and a five - sphere with a constant radius .",

    "rather similar to the @xmath146 electric - magnetic duality , the @xmath147 rotation along the @xmath139 of the black hole metric ( [ adsbh ] ) yields the soliton metric ( [ adssoliton ] ) .",
    "in addition , the general solutions eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) , that correspond to the rotation along the @xmath139 by an arbitrary angle , reveal the existence of  dyonic \" solutions , some of which might have , in principle , a lower energy than that of the @xmath1 soliton ( [ adssoliton ] ) .",
    "however , we can show that all of these  dyonic \" solutions have naked singularities .",
    "for this purpose , we directly compute the square of the riemann tensor from the metric ( [ general ] ) to find @xmath148 where the function @xmath149 is given by @xmath150   ( 1- 2 x^4 ) - 8 \\alpha_1 ^ 2 \\alpha_2 ^ 2 / 27}{2 d^2 } .\\ ] ] the first term in eq .",
    "( [ rr4 ] ) is the contribution from the @xmath1 vacuum , and the second term is the contribution from the @xmath1 black hole ( or the same contribution from the @xmath1 soliton ) .",
    "we note that the third term has the double pole singularity in @xmath151 variable at @xmath152 . from the spatial infinity ( @xmath3 boundary ) to the point @xmath153 , the position of the horizon in the case of the @xmath1 black holes , the radial space - time evolution is smooth . due to the singularity at @xmath154 , however , the space - time geometry of eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) has a naked singularity unless , at least , @xmath155 . for the lack of singularity at @xmath156 , in fact ,",
    "both coefficients of the @xmath157 term and the constant term of @xmath149 should vanish since the third term of eq .",
    "( [ rr4 ] ) has a double pole singularity .",
    "the value of @xmath158 , which ranges from zero to one , as we traverse along the circle @xmath139 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig34 ] .",
    "we immediately find from the figures that there are only two points on @xmath139 at which the function @xmath158 vanishes .",
    "they precisely correspond to the @xmath1 solitons and the @xmath1 black holes .",
    "for these two cases , the whole function @xmath159 is identically zero and , as a result , the third term in eq .",
    "( [ rr4 ] ) itself disappears .",
    "this consideration shows that all of the general solutions eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) other than the @xmath1 black holes and @xmath1 solitons have naked singularity at @xmath156 .",
    "to summarize , the general solutions of the five - dimensional iib supergravity spontaneously compactified on a five - sphere satisfying the asymptotic condition ( asymptotically locally @xmath1 ) and of the form @xmath160 are parameterized by all points on @xmath15 . among these points ,",
    "naked - singularity - free solutions are @xmath1 black holes ( the ray from the origin toward the positive @xmath69-axis of @xmath15 ) , @xmath1 solitons ( the ray from the origin toward the positive @xmath161-axis of @xmath15 ) and the vacuum @xmath1 space - time ( the origin of @xmath15 ) , and all other solutions possess naked singularities .",
    "this result points to the feasibility of the part of the horowitz - myers conjecture , which , in turn , via the ads / cft correspondence , will be related to the stability of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory on a space - time whose spatial section is a two - torus .    for the hermiticity of the gauge theory hamiltonian",
    ", the fermions on the @xmath8 should either be periodic ( r sector ) or anti - periodic ( ns sector ) .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the negative energy of the @xmath1 solitons is the same as the casimir energy of the ns sector fermions on a circle up to a factor 3/4 ( also see @xcite ) . in the case of the r sector fermions , the casimir energy vanishes and , for the @xmath1 black holes ,",
    "the energy comes solely from its mass .",
    "the gravity side analysis is consistent with this picture in a sense that for a given value of @xmath133 there are only two discrete points on a circle @xmath139 that correspond to the naked - singularity - free solutions . since the invariant size of the ricci tensor",
    "is bounded from the above ( including the point @xmath162 ) for the interconnecting solutions , one can get the formal expression for the energy by evaluating the surface integral eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) of @xcite as follows @xmath163 although its interpretation as the true energy is not clear due to the presence of the naked singularities of the riemann tensor at @xmath156 .",
    "the quantity eq .",
    "( [ energy ? ] ) calculated in this fashion smoothly increases monotonically , as we move along the circle @xmath139 from the @xmath1 solitons ( negative energy @xmath164 for @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) to the @xmath1 black holes ( positive energy @xmath167 due to the black hole mass for @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) . pushing the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence further , one might expect that the solutions that interconnect these two points and possess naked singularities can be related to non - unitary gauge theories with the fermions whose holonomy along the circle @xmath8 multiplies the fermion field by an arbitrary @xmath146 phase factor .",
    "it remains to be seen if this expectation is true .",
    "an interesting generalization of the analysis presented in this paper is to consider the space - time whose asymptotic geometry is of the form @xmath168 for @xmath169 . in the case of the higher genus , there will be extra positive contribution to the effective potential that results from the negative curvature of the riemann surface .",
    "therefore , we may expect that the regular solutions in this case will have higher energy than the energy of the @xmath1 solitons .",
    "the situation is more dangerous for the genus zero case . as an effective @xmath61-wave sector",
    ", we may expect that the solutions in this sector , _ if exist _ , would have lower energy than the energy of the @xmath1 solitons ; in fact , the explicit examples of @xcite and @xcite , the bubble type solutions , that have an energy which is not bounded from below belong to the @xmath170 case with the vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "more careful analysis of this case will be necessary to prove the horowitz - myers conjecture and therefore to establish the stability of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory on a space - time whose spatial section is a sphere .",
