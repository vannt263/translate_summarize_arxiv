    "one of the most promising projects in todays high energy physics is an electron - positron linear collider , for example tesla @xcite . at such a linear collider one should be able to polarize the electrons with the same technology as at the slc to up to @xmath7 . at tesla",
    "it should also be possible to run with positrons polarized up to @xmath8 @xcite . with a luminosity of @xmath9 at energies close to the peak of the z - resonance tesla",
    "could produce @xmath10 z - bosons in about 70 days of running @xcite",
    ". in this scenario , often referred to as gigaz , the measurements already performed at the electron - positron collider experiments at lep and slc could be redone with increased precision .",
    "an interesting topic is the test of the cp symmetry in z decays .",
    "there is already a number of theoretical ( @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) and experimental @xcite-@xcite studies of this subject . in the present paper",
    "we will study a flavor - diagonal z decay where cp - violating effects within the standard model ( sm ) are estimated to be very small @xcite .",
    "thus , looking for cp violation in such z decays means looking for new physics beyond the sm .    for a model - independent systematic analysis of cp violation in z",
    "decays we use the effective lagrangian approach as described in @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are z decays involving heavy leptons or quarks .",
    "thus , the process z @xmath11 , which is sensitive to effective cp - violating couplings in the @xmath1 vertex , has been analysed theoretically in @xcite and experimentally in @xcite .",
    "no significant deviation from the sm has been found .",
    "if cp - violating couplings are introduced in the @xmath12 vertex , they will , because of gauge invariance of qcd , appear in the @xmath13 vertex as well . but the @xmath2 vertex could in principle contain new coupling parameters .",
    "the analysis of the 4 jet decays of the z boson involving @xmath3 quarks looks into both , 4- and 5-point vertices .",
    "this has been investigated theoretically in @xcite and experimentally in @xcite .",
    "also in this case no significant deviation from the sm has been found .    in this paper",
    "we review the results of the calculations of the processes  and including cp - violating couplings , with at least two of the jets originating from a @xmath3 or @xmath14 quark , for the gigaz scenario assuming longitudinal beam polarization for electrons and positrons .",
    "all details of the calculation for unpolarized @xmath15 , @xmath16 beams can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally we make an estimate for models with excited quarks and show that one can obtain stringent bounds on their mass .",
    "this , however , requires the introduction of a new type of strong interactions for quarks .    in chapter 2 we briefly review the theoretical framework of our computations .",
    "models with excited quarks are discussed in chapter 3 .",
    "next , in chapter 4 , we define cp - odd tensor and vector observables and calculate their sensitivities to anomalous couplings .",
    "achievable bounds on the mass of excited quarks are presented .",
    "our conclusions can be found in chapter 5 .",
    "for a model independent study of cp violation in 3 jet and 4 jet decays of the z boson we use the effective lagrangian approach as explained in @xcite .",
    "we could add to the sm lagrangian @xmath17 a cp - violating term @xmath18 containing all cp - odd local operators with a mass dimension @xmath19 ( electroweak symmetry breaking ) that can be constructed with sm fields .",
    "however , it turns out that quite a number of such coupling terms can contribute to the reactions analysed here . to keep the analysis manageable we restrict ourselves to coupling terms involving the z and the @xmath3 quarks and in addition any number of gluons .",
    "then the effective cp - violating lagrangian with @xmath20 relevant to our analysis is : @xmath21 \\\\    & + & [ \\ ; h_{vb}\\ : \\bar{b}(x)\\ : t^a\\ : \\gamma^{\\nu}\\ :    b(x ) +   h_{ab}\\ : \\bar{b}(x)\\ : t^a\\ : \\gamma^{\\nu}\\ : \\gamma_5\\ : b(x)\\ ; ] \\ ;    z^{\\mu}(x)\\ :     g^a_{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the @xmath3 quark field , @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the field of the z boson and the field strength tensor of the gluon , respectively , and @xmath25 are the generators of @xmath26 @xcite . in ( [ lcp ] )",
    "@xmath27 is the weak dipole moment and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are cp - violating vector and axial vector chirality conserving coupling constants . as effective coupling constants in @xmath18 the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are real .",
    "they are related to form factors of vertices but should not be confused with the latter ( see e.  g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath18 is required to be invariant under the electromagnetic and strong gauge group @xmath30 .",
    "we do not require explicit gauge invariance under the complete @xmath31 group of the electroweak interaction , since we consider the theory after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the couplings of ( [ lcp ] ) can , however , always be generated from higher dimensional @xmath32 invariant couplings involving suitable higgs fields , see  @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants in ( [ lcp ] ) are then proportional to powers of the higgs vacuum expectation value . also , in theories ",
    "which we do not want to exclude a priori from our discussion  where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are composite objects the @xmath32 group has not necessarily a fundamental meaning ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "even if compositeness is not favoured by the lep data @xcite this option for going beyond the sm should certainly be investigated again at the gigaz factory .",
    "information on the spin of the final state partons is hardly available experimentally .",
    "thus , we consider as observables only the parton s energies and momenta .",
    "then , effects linear in the dipole form factor @xmath27 are suppressed by powers of @xmath35 .",
    "so angular correlations of the jets in  and z @xmath0 4 jets are only sensitive to the couplings @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding vertices following from @xmath18 are shown in figure  [ fig : vert ] . because the non - abelian field strength tensor has a term quadratic in the gluon fields the @xmath1- and @xmath36-vertices",
    "are related .",
    "we define dimensionless coupling constants @xmath37 using the z mass as the scale parameter by @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the weak mixing angle . for numerical calculations we set @xmath42gev , @xmath43 and the fine structure constant and @xmath44 at the z mass to @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "our calculations are carried out in leading order of the cp - violating couplings of @xmath18 and the sm couplings .",
    "a non - vanishing @xmath3 quark mass of @xmath47gev is included quark . in our leading order calculation",
    "we could as well use the running @xmath3 mass at @xmath48 : @xmath49 gev @xcite .",
    "this would result only in minimal changes in our correlations . ] ; masses of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 quarks are neglected .",
    "in this chapter we discuss the possible generation of chirality conserving cp - violating interactions as introduced in the previous chapter in models with excited quarks .",
    "excitations of quarks would be natural in a scenario where quarks have substructure and participate in a new type of strong interaction .",
    "this type of models and effects from excited quarks at hadron colliders have for instance been discussed in @xcite . in particular , we assume here that @xmath3 quarks have excited partners @xmath54 , which could have spin @xmath55 or @xmath56 . for simplicity",
    "we consider a @xmath54 of spin @xmath55 and mass @xmath57 .",
    "due to higher order dimensional operators in composite models chirality - conserving @xmath58 couplings at the scale of gigaz energies are a priori possible ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "because of colour gauge invariance we expect the @xmath59 couplings to be chirality - flipping dipole couplings .",
    "then , couplings @xmath37 as introduced in ( [ lcp ] ) can be generated by the following effective interactions of @xmath54 and @xmath3 quarks , @xmath33 bosons and gluons : @xmath60 here @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are complex parameters , which can be expected to be of order one if the underlying dynamics is strongly interacting .",
    "in addition to @xmath63 , the chromoelectric dipole transition form factor @xmath64 , there will be in general also a chromomagnetic transition form factor @xmath65 which is omitted here for brevity .",
    "the couplings @xmath37 have been calculated @xcite in this model from the diagrams of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : excquark ] for @xmath66 : @xmath67",
    "in our study we assume that one is able to flavor - tag the @xmath3 quarks and to measure their momenta .",
    "this is justified due to the extremely good @xmath3-tagging capabilities foreseen at tesla @xcite .",
    "for instance , the impact parameter resolution at tesla is expected to be about a factor 10 better than at lep @xcite .",
    "the definition of a 3 and 4 jet sample requires the introduction of resolution cuts .",
    "we use jade cuts @xcite requiring @xmath68 with @xmath69 the angle between the momentum directions of any two partons ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 , @xmath72 their energies in the z rest system .",
    "we study our cp - violating couplings using cp - odd observables constructed from the momentum directions of the @xmath3 and @xmath14 quarks , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see @xcite ) : @xmath75 @xmath76 with @xmath77 , @xmath78 the cartesian vector indices in the z rest system .    the observables @xmath79 transform as tensor components , @xmath80 as vector components . for polarized @xmath81 beams and our rotationally invariant cuts ( [ jade ] ) their expectation values are then proportional to the z tensor polarization @xmath82 and vector polarization @xmath83 , respectively . for all definitions concerning the @xmath33",
    "density matrix see section 2.1 of @xcite . defining the positive @xmath84-axis in the @xmath15 beam direction",
    ", we have @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 the weak vector and axial vector @xmath91 couplings . @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the longitudinal polarizations for positron and electron , respectively , measured in the direction of the particle s velocity .",
    "we have @xmath94 . from ( [ s ] )  ( [ s30 ] ) we see that the components @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the most sensitive ones .",
    "note that the tensor observables do _ not _ change their sign upon charge misidentification ( @xmath97 ) whereas the vector observables do .",
    "thus , it is only for the measurement of the latter that charge identification is indispensable .",
    "we have computed the expectation values of the observables ( [ ten ] ) , ( [ vec ] ) for different jade cuts ( [ jade ] ) , as function of @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath100    the expectation value of a cp - odd observable @xmath101 has the following general form : @xmath102 here @xmath103 are constants , @xmath104 and @xmath105 denote the corresponding  and decay widths in the sm and in the theory with sm plus cp - violating couplings , respectively .",
    "note that terms quadratic in the anomalous couplings are cp - even .",
    "thus on the r.h.s . of ( [ cpoddobs ] )",
    "they only emerge in @xmath105 . in an experimental analysis one has two options .",
    "the first one is to study directly the expectation values @xmath106 which have a non - linear dependence on , .",
    "this dependence becomes linear for small anomalous couplings . in the following",
    "we will neglect non - linear terms , that is assume @xmath107 .",
    "the other option is to take @xmath104 from the theoretical calculation , @xmath105 and @xmath106 from the experimental measurement .",
    "the quantity @xmath108 is then an observable strictly linear in the anomalous couplings , which has obvious advantages .    for unpolarised @xmath109",
    "beams a non - zero value @xmath110 for one of our cp - odd observables above is an unambiguous indicator of cp violation . for longitudinally polarised beams this holds if possible chirality flipping interactions at the @xmath111 vertex  which do not exist in the sm",
    " are neglected .",
    "see  @xcite for an extensive discussion of this point .    from the measurement of a single observable ( [ cpoddobs ] ) we can get a simple estimate of its sensitivity to  by assuming @xmath112 .",
    "the error on a measurement of  is then to leading order in the anomalous couplings : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the number of events within cuts .",
    "similarly , assuming @xmath115 we get the error on  as @xmath116 a measure for the sensitivity of  to  ( ) is then @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .    in very good approximation",
    ", it was found for  and  that the tensor observables are only sensitive to @xmath119 and the vector observables only to @xmath120 . a detailed discussion about that can be found in @xcite .",
    "a measurement of  ,  has to produce a mean value larger than @xmath121 ( [ dhb ] ) , @xmath122 ( [ dhbn ] ) to be able to claim a non - zero effect at the 1 s.  d. level .",
    "we have calculated the sensitivities to @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the tensor ( [ ten ] ) and vector ( [ vec ] ) observables varying the jet resolution parameter .",
    "comparing with optimal observables it was found for unpolarized beams @xcite that these simple observables ( [ ten],[vec ] ) reach nearly optimal sensitivities .",
    "therefore optimal observables are not considered in the following .",
    "we assume a total number of @xmath123 z decays for unpolarized beams , following the gigaz scenario .",
    "the number @xmath114 of events within cuts which is available for the analysis is then given by @xmath124 with @xmath125 being the total z decay width . solely due to higher statistics in gigaz of about a factor of one hundred compared to the sum of the four lep experiments , the sensitivity to the cp violating couplings increases by a factor 10 , as can be seen from ( [ dhb ] , [ dhbn ] ) .",

    "[ fig : del_asym_4jets ] for  for different longitudinal beam polarizations .",
    "the sensitivity decreases with increasing @xmath126 for all observables due to the decrease in number of events available .    because the expectation value of the tensor observable does not depend on longitudinal polarization ( [ sij ] ) ,",
    "the differences in  for different polarization choices reflect only the change in statistics . for @xmath127 and @xmath128 the enhancement of the z production rate is largest .",

    "the sensitivity increases by more than a factor of six compared to unpolarized beams .",
    "a convenient choice of the polarizations can even lead to a better sensitivity of the vector observable to  than of the tensor observable to .",

    "observable this can not happen because the sensitivity to  depends on the polarization only due to the change in the total number of z decays .",
    "it should be stressed that in this article we present a tree - level calculation .",
    "thus next - to - leading order qcd corrections are not taken into account .",
    "for the sm part they can be found in @xcite for  including non - vanishing @xmath3 quark masses and in @xcite for  for massless quarks .",
