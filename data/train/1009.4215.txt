    "although there is no thermodynamic requirement that imposes an upper limit on @xmath0 , until 2001 no progress had been made in increasing @xmath0 above 1 .",
    "the difficulty is due to the interrelations between the coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 that set limitations in varying them independently .",

    "<S> we study the thermoelectric coefficients of a multi - level quantum dot ( qd ) weakly coupled to two electron reservoirs in the coulomb blockade regime . detailed calculations and analytical expressions of the power factor and the figure of merit are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our interest to the limit where the energy separation between successive energy levels is much larger than the thermal energy ( i.e. , the quantum limit ) and we report a giant enhancement of the figure of merit due to the violation of the wiedemann - franz law when phonons are frozen . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the similarity of the electronic and the phonon contribution to the thermal conductance for zero dimensional electrons and phonons . </S>",
    "<S> both contributions show an activated behavior . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that the control of the electron and phonon confinement effects can lead to nanostructures with improved thermoelectric properties . </S>"
