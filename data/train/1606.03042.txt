    "the @xmath1 transition is characterized by the dominant dipole form factor ( @xmath5 ) and two sub - leading quadrupole form factors : the electric ( @xmath6 ) and the coulomb ( @xmath7 ) form factors  @xcite .",
    "the nonzero results for the quadrupole form factors are a consequence of the deviation of the @xmath8 from a spherical shape  @xcite .",
    "calculations based on the limit of a large number of colors ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath9 quark models with symmetry breaking suggest that , in the low @xmath2 region the @xmath1 quadrupole form factors are dominated by pion cloud effects  @xcite .",
    "estimates based exclusively on valence quarks underestimate the data by about an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "although small comparative to the leading order pion cloud contributions , the valence quark contributions can nevertheless help to improve the description of the data  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath0 parametrizations of the @xmath1 electric and coulomb quadrupole form factors have , however , a problem : they are in conflict with siegert s theorem  @xcite .    in the form factors representation , siegert s theorem is expressed by the identity at the pseudo - threshold : @xmath10  @xcite ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the nucleon and the @xmath13 masses ) .",
    "the pseudo - threshold is the limit where the magnitude of the photon three - momentum , @xmath14 , vanishes , and @xmath15 .",
    "a test for the validity of siegert s theorem is the value of _ pt=",
    "g_e(q_pt^2 ) - g_c ( q_pt^2 ) , [ eqr ] where = . when @xmath16 , siegert s theorem is verified . when @xmath17 , the form factors are inconsistent with siegert s theorem .    the combination of @xmath9 quark models with two - body exchange currents and the large @xmath0 limit provides a connection between the neutron charge distribution and the @xmath1 quadrupole form factors  @xcite .",
    "in an exact @xmath9 quark model , the neutron electric form factor vanishes and the electric and coulomb quadrupole moments of the @xmath1 transition are both zero .",
    "when the @xmath9 symmetry is broken we can relate the quadrupole moments with the neutron square charge radius @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "we can then conclude that the @xmath9 symmetry breaking induces an asymmetric distribution of charge in the nucleon , which generates nonzero results for the neutron electric form factor @xmath19 , and for the @xmath1 quadrupole transition form factors , @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "moreover , based on the low @xmath2 expansion of the neutron electric form factor , @xmath20 , we can extrapolate the @xmath2 dependence of the quadrupole form factors to  @xcite & & g_e ( q^2)= ( ) ^3/2 g_en ( q^2 ) [ eqge ] + & & g_c ( q^2)= ( ) ^1/2 m m_g_en ( q^2 ) , [ eqgc ] where @xmath21 .",

    "in this work we present improved large @xmath0 pion cloud parametrizations for the quadrupole form factors in order to obtain a parametrization consistent simultaneously with siegert s theorem and with the empirical data of the @xmath1 quadrupole form factors .",
    "we conclude first that the relations ( [ eqge])([eqgc ] ) implies that siegert s theorem is violated by terms @xmath22 , which may be a sizable error in the case @xmath23 .",
    "since the relations ( [ eqge])-([eqgc ] ) are extrapolated from large @xmath0 they can have relative deviations of the order @xmath3 .",
    "we then use the constraints of siegert s theorem to modify the relation for @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain parametrizations for the quadrupole form factors that violate siegert s theorem only by terms @xmath24 .",
    "this result is thus compatible with siegert s theorem apart from higher - order corrections in @xmath3 .",
    "we look also for additional contributions for the transition form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , namely the contributions from the valence quarks from the nucleon and @xmath8 systems . as mentioned , those contributions are small in the context of quark models but combined with the parametrizations of the pion cloud contributions they can reduce the gap between theory and data",
    ". an interesting propriety of the valence quark contributions for the electromagnetic form factors is that they vanish in the pseudo - threshold limit , as consequence of the orthogonality between the nucleon and @xmath8 wave functions . as a consequence",
    ", the test of siegert s theorem condition @xmath16 needs to be tested only for the pion cloud contribution of the transitions form factors .    at the end , we combine valence and pion cloud contributions using a model compatible with siegert s theorem apart from higher - order corrections in @xmath3 . the results are then compared with the empirical data for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , showing a fair description of the overall data .",
    "we can test the quality of the relations ( [ eqge])([eqgc ] ) comparing those functions with the data based on some parametrization for @xmath19 . to represent the electric form factor of the neutron",
    ", we considers the galster parametrization  @xcite g_en(q^2 ) = - _ n g_d , [ eqgenx ] where @xmath25 is the neutron magnetic moment , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the dipole factor , and @xmath28 are two dimensionless parameters .    the quadrupole form factors obtained with the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xcite are presented in fig .  [ figmodel0 ] . for a better test of siegert s theorem",
    "we multiply the function @xmath7 and the data for @xmath7 by @xmath31 .",
    "the calculations are compared with the data from mainz  @xcite , mit - bates  @xcite and jefferson lab  @xcite for finite square momentum transfer , @xmath2 , and the world average from the particle data group for @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the data are compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is clear in fig .",
    "[ figmodel0 ] that , the difference between the parametrizations for @xmath6 and @xmath33 is not zero in the pseudo - threshold limit , when @xmath34 gev@xmath35 .",
    "this result implies that siegert s theorem is violated , because @xmath17 .",

    "although a result @xmath40 may be seen as a small quantity , the numerical value is still sizable , as we can see in the graph for @xmath41 at the pseudo - threshold ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "before discussing how to improve the pion cloud parametrization of the quadrupole form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we may question if siegert s theorem can in fact be verified for the valence quark sector .",
    "we look then for the results obtained within valence quark models .",
    "we consider , in particular , the covariant spectator quark model developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the nucleon and @xmath8 systems .",
    "the basic assumptions of the model are that : ( i ) in the electromagnetic interaction the photon couples with the single quark ( impulse approximation ) while the other two quarks can be interpreted as an effective diquark , ( ii ) the quarks have their own internal structure ( dressed by gluons and quark - antiquark states ) , and ( iii ) the radial quark - diquark wave functions are calibrated in terms of momentum range parameters that can be estimated by physical or lattice qcd data .",
    "concerning the nucleon and @xmath8 systems the model is quite successful in the description of the data .",
    "the parameters associated with the quark structure ( quark electromagnetic form factors ) were first fixed by the nucleon elastic form factor data  @xcite .",
    "after that the model was used to estimate the valence quark contribution for the @xmath43 magnetic dipole form factor  @xcite .",
    "the results are compatible simultaneously with estimates from dynamical reactions models  @xcite and with lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "the model for the @xmath8 was then extended with the inclusion of @xmath44 states in the wave function  @xcite .",
    "we consider , in particular , the parametrization from ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    "the @xmath8 system is described by a combination a @xmath45-wave and two @xmath44-wave quark - diquark states .",
    "the @xmath44 states can be labeled as @xmath46 ( quark total spin 3/2 ) and @xmath47 ( quark total spin 1/2 )  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon system is represented just by a @xmath45 state  @xcite . in the limit where the @xmath44-state mixtures vanish , we obtain @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath44-state mixtures and the @xmath44-radial wave functions are determined by a fit to the lattice qcd data from ref .",
    "@xcite and then extrapolated to the physical point .",
    "the admixture of @xmath44 states is about 0.72% for both states .",
    "the extrapolation from lattice qcd for the physical regime is performed using a vector meson parametrization of the quark current ( quark electromagnetic form factors ) .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the valence quark contributions to the quadrupole form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 from ref .",
    "@xcite are presented in fig .",
    "[ figval ] . in the figure",
    ", we again compare @xmath6 with @xmath33 .",
    "the more interesting aspect of the figure is that siegert s theorem is exactly verified , as we can see from the result @xmath50 at the pseudo - threshold .",
    "this result is a consequence of @xmath51 at the same point .    in the covariant spectator quark model , the quadrupole form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 are calculated in terms of angular integrals of a function @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are , respectively , the diquark and the photon momenta . in the pseudo - threshold limit ( @xmath55 )",
    ", the function @xmath52 reduces to the spherical harmonic @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the function @xmath56 is then the consequence of the overlap between the @xmath8 @xmath44 states and the nucleon @xmath45 state . since in the pseudo - threshold limit",
    "there is no dependence in the photon momentum @xmath14 , the angular integrals are reduced to the angular integration of @xmath56 , which vanishes . consequently the form factors vanish too .",
    "the result @xmath57 at the pseudo - threshold is then the corollary of the orthogonality between @xmath45 and @xmath44 states .    in fig .",
    "[ figval ] , we can notice the turning of the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 near @xmath58 gev@xmath35 , just above the photon point @xmath32 and a soft convergence to zero at the pseudo - threshold .",
    "the reduction of the quadrupole form factors near @xmath32 can also be seen in the lattice qcd data  @xcite . as we will see next , the presence of the maximum for @xmath7 near @xmath59 gev@xmath35 , instead at @xmath32 , has implications in the values of @xmath7 at small @xmath2 .",
    "another interesting aspect concerning fig .",
    "[ figval ] is the function @xmath41 for finite @xmath2 .",
    "we can see that the function @xmath60 is very small compared with @xmath6 or @xmath33 .",
    "we then concludes , that in the covariant spectator quark model , the results @xmath6 and @xmath33 are very similar .",
    "it is possible that the relation @xmath61 is also valid for other quark models .",
    "we note , in particular , that the estimate of the quark core contribution used in the sato - lee model assumes @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we can now discuss if , as for the valence quark sector , the pion cloud parametrization is also consistent with siegert s theorem .    in the large @xmath0 limit the baryons are infinitely heavy and can be treated as static . for this reason large @xmath0",
    "is mostly used to calculate static proprieties of the baryon and transition between baryon states  @xcite . in particular , the relations ( [ eqge])-([eqgc ] ) are extensions of large @xmath0 relations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 at @xmath32 for finite @xmath2  @xcite . those relations are not derived explicitly from large @xmath0 , but , since they derivation for @xmath32 is based on large @xmath0 , one can infer that they are also limited by the accuracy from the large @xmath0 analysis , and can therefore be affected by relative corrections of the order @xmath3",
    "@xcite .    instead of using the @xmath63 expansion to calculate possible @xmath3 relative corrections",
    ", one can use siegert s theorem to check if there are corrections that are consistent with the theorem .",
    "one notes that the use of constraints external to the @xmath9 and large @xmath0 formalisms were used already in the calculation of coefficients associated with physical quantities as the charge radius , quadrupole moments and others  @xcite .    in a first attempt we checked if we can have an exact description of siegert s theorem , modifying the functions @xmath6 or @xmath7 keeping at the same time the results for @xmath32 , derived from large @xmath0 .",
    "considering the replacement @xmath64 , we can preserve the result from large @xmath0 at @xmath32 , if we calculate @xmath65 in order to obtain @xmath16 at the pseudo - threshold .",
    "the solution for this condition is @xmath66 .",
    "we obtain the same effect if we replace @xmath67 .",
    "the problem of the new form for @xmath6 is that it vanishes when @xmath68 , in conflict with the data .",
    "we then try an approximated solution , replacing @xmath69 , which induces no zeros for @xmath70 .",
    "one obtain in this case & & g_e ( q^2)= ( ) ^3/2 .",
    "[ eqge2 ] the previous relation differs from eq .",
    "( [ eqge ] ) at the pseudo - threshold only by a term @xmath40 .    with the new form for @xmath6 , one obtains _ pt ( ) ^3/2 q_pt^2 , which is now a term @xmath71 , since @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the expected falloff for large @xmath2 of the pion cloud contributions for the form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eqgc ] ) and ( [ eqge2 ] ) are @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "one recall however those contributions are derived from the low @xmath2 expansion of the neutron electric form factor and its application is in principle limited to intermediate values of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the high @xmath2 region is expected to be dominated by the valence quark degrees of freedom  @xcite as discussed later .",
    "to summarize , we use siegert s theorem to find a correction for the form factor @xmath6 that minimizes the violation of siegert s theorem .",
    "the solution proposed , given by eq .",
    "( [ eqge2 ] ) is not exact , but reduces the violation of siegert s theorem to a term of the order @xmath4 , the proposed function preserves the result for @xmath76 obtained in the large @xmath0 framework , and correspond to a relative correction of @xmath3 to the result of @xmath6 at the pseudo - threshold .",
    "since , as discussed , the pion cloud component represents only the leading order effect in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , we combine the new pion cloud parametrizations with the valence quark contributions of the covariant spectator quark model ( consistent with siegert s theorem ) .",
    "the sum of the two contributions is presented in fig .",
    "[ figmodel2 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ figmodel2 ] , we conclude that , apart from the results for @xmath7 below 0.2 gev@xmath35 , to be discussed later , we obtain a very good description of the overall data .",
    "this represents a considerable improvement comparative to the previous pion cloud parametrizations ( see fig .",
    "[ figmodel0 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the form factors are now compatible with siegert s theorem , within an error of the order @xmath4 .",
    "the smallness of the error can be visualized in the figure if we look for @xmath41 at the pseudo - threshold .    for future reference",
    "we call the attention for the fact that , the nonzero results for the form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 are a direct consequence of the pion cloud contributions , since as discussed , the valence quark contribution vanishes at the pseudo - threshold .    for a final discussion of the results , we need to take into account that the pion cloud contributions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 can have relative deviations of the order @xmath3 from eqs .",
    "( [ eqgc ] ) and ( [ eqge2 ] ) , as discussed previously . to represent those deviations we include a band of @xmath77 in the graphs for @xmath6 and @xmath33 to represent the possible relative deviation ( term of order @xmath3 ) from the estimate of the pion cloud contribution .",
    "note that the @xmath77 deviation is more relevant for the discussion of the spacelike region , where the data are available , than near the pseudo - threshold .",
    "the final results for @xmath6 and @xmath7 including the variation band are presented in fig .",
    "[ figmodel3 ] . in the figure",
    "we compare also the results with the maid - sg2 parametrization from ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to better visualize the difference between our model and the data at low @xmath2 .",
    "the maid - sg2 gives a high quality description of the data , and it is compatible with siegert s theorem .    from the graph for @xmath7",
    ", we can conclude that , the gap between the present model and the data for @xmath78 gev@xmath35 may not be explained by the pion cloud contribution , since the data are out of the band .",
    "we tested unsuccessfully if the quality of the description at low @xmath2 could be improved considering a parametrization of the @xmath19 data more complex than the galster parametrization ( [ eqgenx ] ) .",
    "those results are an indication that the gap between model and data may be a consequence of the valence quark contributions .",
    "parametrizations of the quark core contributions closer to a dipole form as in the sato - lee and dmt models from ref .",
    "@xcite are more appropriate to describe the data measured at low @xmath2 .",
    "those parametrizations , however , differ in shape , from the estimates presented in fig .",
    "[ figval ] , and are not compatible with the shape required by siegert s theorem and the soft convergence to zero at the pseudo - threshold . a comparison between the results from the covariant spectator quark model and the parametrization from ref .",
    "@xcite can be found in ref .",
    "as discussed in the context of the covariant spectator quark model , the convergence to zero at the pseudo - threshold is a consequence of the orthogonality between the nucleon and the @xmath8 states .",
    "the shape of the valence quark contributions in the region @xmath320.2 gev@xmath35 can in principle be tested with the help of lattice qcd simulations . with the advent of the lattice qcd simulations near the physical point",
    ", it is expected that in the near future the lattice qcd simulations approaches the physical point . in those conditions ,",
    "lattice simulations in quenched qcd and partially quenched qcd approximations may be compared with our estimate of the valence quark contributions .",
    "also , the pion cloud contributions can be estimated from the comparison between full qcd and quenched qcd .",
    "an indication that the low @xmath2 data for @xmath7 are reliable comes from the chiral effective - field theory , which connects the lattice qcd data with large pion masses with the physical regime  @xcite .",
    "independent of the source of the discrepancy of @xmath7 for @xmath78 gev@xmath35 , the shape of the form factor @xmath7 has implications in the coulomb quadrupole square radius .",
    "some authors argue that the low @xmath2 behavior of @xmath7 is a consequence of the long extension of the pion cloud  @xcite .",
    "other works suggest instead , that , as a consequence of siegert s theorem , @xmath7 becomes smoother near @xmath32  @xcite , which according with the present analysis may be a consequence of the valence quark contributions , since the pion cloud contribution is sharper near @xmath32 .    in the range of the data presented @xmath79 gev@xmath35 the pion cloud contributions are still sizable ( see fig .  [ figmodel0 ] ) .",
    "as discussed the pion cloud parametrization are in principle valid for low @xmath2 and may be modified for larger values of @xmath2 . for @xmath6",
    "the valence quark component falls as @xmath80 , as expected from a quark model  @xcite , and dominates over the pion cloud component ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "as for @xmath7 the valence quark component falls as @xmath81 , as the pion cloud component .",
    "the final falloff is then @xmath82 and @xmath75 , respectively , consistent with pqcd  @xcite .",
    "we conclude then that , for very large @xmath2 , the present model is compatible with the expected pqcd falloff .",
    "recall that the pqcd falloff is the consequence of the dominance of the valence quark contributions  @xcite .",
    "another pqcd prediction is that , @xmath83 , for very large @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "experimentally we are nowadays far away from this result  @xcite .",
    "overall , our calculations support the idea that the physics associated with the @xmath1 transition can be described by adding pionic degrees of freedom to the quark models  @xcite .",
    "dynamical reaction models such as the sato - lee model  @xcite and the dmt model  @xcite , which calculate the pion cloud dynamically , are also in qualitative agreement with the data . in those models",
    "the bare core contributions are estimated phenomenologically as already discussed for the case of ref .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a new pion cloud parametrization for the @xmath84 electric quadrupole form factor .",
    "the new form for @xmath6 is consistent with siegert s theorem , @xmath85 , at the pseudo - threshold , within an error of @xmath4 .",
    "we have also discussed the implications of siegert s theorem to the bare core contribution of the quadrupole form factors .",
    "contrary to the pion cloud contributions , the valence quark contributions vanish at the pseudo - threshold .",
    "combining the new parametrizations of pion cloud contributions with the valence quark contributions for the same form factors , we have obtained a very accurate description of the quadrupole form factors data , apart from a small underestimation of the @xmath7 data in the region @xmath320.15 gev@xmath35 .",
    "future developments in lattice qcd may help to clarify if the the gap between theory and data at low @xmath2 is a consequence of the underestimation of the valence quark component or of the pion cloud component .",
