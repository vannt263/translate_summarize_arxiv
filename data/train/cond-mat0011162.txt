    "the dynamics of propagating solitary waves ( pulses ) and monotone fronts in nonlinear partial differential equations ( _ pde _",
    "s ) have been the focus of extensive research .",
    "such problems are of interest in a wide range of fields including biology ( population dynamics ) @xcite , chemical reactions and combustion @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , and semiconductor electronic transport @xcite .",
    "a common problem is to understand and predict the form and speed of the waves , as well as the possibility of multiple excitations in a sample of finite or infinite extent , and their interactions .",
    "we focus here on a model of electrical conduction in extrinsic semiconductors ( involving time and only one spatial dimension ) which exhibits negative differential resistance ( ndr ) and moving domains of high electric field .",
    "the model is specifically relevant to experiments on cooled bulk p - type ge under voltage bias conditions , @xcite , but much of the observed qualitative behavior applies to a broad class of semiconductor systems with space charge instabilities .",
    "phenomena observed for the p - ge system include time - periodic oscillation of the current in a purely resistive external circuit under dc voltage bias due to the periodic creation of a solitary wave at the injecting contact , its motion inside the semiconductor and its annihilation at the receiving contact @xcite .",
    "there is some similarity to the gunn effect in n - gaas , except that : ( i ) the local current density versus field characteristics [ see @xmath0 below ] in p - ge presents an increasing third branch after the ndr region , and ( ii ) the solitary waves in p - ge move much more slowly than the carrier drift velocity ( the case in the usual gunn effect ) due to the generation - recombination dynamics of ionized traps which dominate the transport properties .",
    "other experimental observations include intermittency near the onset of the oscillatory instability @xcite , and `` spatiotemporal '' chaos under combined dc and ac voltage bias @xcite .",
    "another important feature is the integral constraint which corresponds to voltage bias applied across sample contacts in semiconductor problems .",
    "integral constraints also occur in other situations , for example , expressing mass conservation in problems of phase separation in binary mixtures and in certain biological problems @xcite .",
    "many of these phenomena have been successfully explained by means of a drift - diffusion model which includes impurity trapping of mobile holes and impact ionization of neutral acceptors @xcite . although much work has been done on this model problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) , important basic questions concerning its asymptotic description and chaos under time independent voltage bias are still open . in this paper , we present numerical simulation results which show chaos under dc voltage bias associated with multiple shedding of wavefronts .",
    "multiple shedding of wavefronts occurs for appropriate values of contact resistivity , and was recently predicted on the basis of asymptotic calculations @xcite .",
    "here we introduce a finite dimensional model which provides a simplified description of space charge wave dynamics in long samples .",
    "this model uses relevant information from the asymptotics in ref .",
    "@xcite , although we do not rigorously derive it from such asymptotic calculations . nevertheless , solutions of the simplified model are in good agreement with the results of direct numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present a drift - diffusion model which accurately describes the propagation of space charge wavefronts in extrinsic semiconductors under dc voltage bias such as p - ge . in section",
    "iii we present numerical simulation results of the drift - diffusion model which indicate that wavefronts may propagate chaotically due to multiple shedding of wavefronts for appropriate bias in sufficiently long samples .",
    "section iv presents the asymptotic model and numerical simulations thereof which are then compared with results from the drift - diffusion model .",
    "conclusions are finally presented in section v.",
    "in dimensionless form , the drift - diffusion model equations for a sample of length @xmath1 can be written in a form @xcite :    @xmath2    the first equation describes the spatio - temporal evolution of the electric field @xmath3 inside the sample , where @xmath4 is the total current density .",
    "the transport coefficients @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the average ( drift ) velocity of microscopic charge carriers ( holes in the case of p - ge ) , and coefficients describing the creation of free carriers via impurity impact ionization and the destruction of free carriers by capture onto an available impurity trapping site ( i.e. , neutral acceptor ) .",
    "all are nonlinear functions of electric field , and their forms and plots have been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the same forms as in ref .",
    "equation ( [ gc ] ) is a global constraint which expresses the voltage bias condition , and eq .",

    "we refer to eqs .",

    "we have adopted the same symbol for both dimensional and non - dimensional variables .    the qualitative nature of much of the dynamical behavior found in the reduced drift - diffusion model  e.g . , the instability of the stationary electric - field profile and propagating high - field domains @xcite  depends only on the presence of a region of negative slope of the homogeneous stationary current density @xmath13 - 1 \\}$ ] , @xcite over an interval of positive fields , and not on the exact form of the underlying coefficients .",
    "this is particularly true when the sample is closely compensated ( the ratio of the acceptor concentration to the donor concentration , @xmath14 , is only slightly larger than 1 ) .",
    "then @xmath0 is n - shaped for large enough positive fields : there is an interval @xmath15 between the abcissas of the maximum [ @xmath16 and the minimum [ @xmath17 current density for which @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ j_sh ] . also shown in fig .",
    "[ j_sh ] is the injecting contact characteristic which plays a crucial role in determining when new fronts are injected into the sample .",
    "the critical current density , @xmath20 , corresponds to the intersection of the contact characteristic with the homogeneous stationary current density .",
    "the role of @xmath20 has been elucidated using a rigorous asymptotic analysis of the system eqs .",
    "( [ red ] ) - ( [ bc ] ) in the limit as @xmath21 @xcite , and is discussed further in section iv .",
    "to solve the system of equations ( [ red ] ) - ( [ bc ] ) for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we discretize the equations using finite difference approximations to the derivatives and employ an implicit method to generate the solution .",
    "the initial condition for the electric field is spatially uniform with a value that is consistent with the global constraint , eq .",
    "( [ gc ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ ext.p1 ] we show a space - time plot of the electric field and associated current density for @xmath24 v / cm , just above the threshold voltage value for which propagating domain behavior occurs .",
    "the gray scale ranges from 5.3 v / cm ( black ) to 14.2 v / cm ( white ) , and this scale is used in all similar plots that follow .",
    "the dimensionless sample length is 3800 corresponding to a real p - ge sample of length 3.87 cm , and the contact resistivity @xmath25 is 780 @xmath26 corresponding to a value of 10.0 in dimensionless units .",
    "this case corresponds well to experimental data , but published data in p - ge were only presented for one sample and relatively low bias values and contact resistivity .",
    "we clearly see that a single domain moves across the sample at constant speed , until it reaches the receiving contact .",
    "as it disappears , a new wave is created at the injecting contact and the process repeats periodically .",
    "the current versus time plot indicates that the current is steady when the domain moves in the sample interior , while there is an increase when the domain reaches the receiving contact .",
    "it is important to note that the fronts of changing electric field ( or equivalently , the regions of nonzero charge density ) are sharp in space relative to other physical length scales for this problem , i.e , the extent of the flat top domains or the sample length . we have found that this separation of length scales increases with sample length and holds for most biases of interest .",
    "it is only for voltages near the onset point that one tends to observe rounded solitary waves rather than well - separated pairs of fronts ; this is the dominant space charge wave structure observed in shorter samples and has been extensively reported @xcite .    as the bias increases ,",
    "the propagating domain becomes fatter and eventually a second small domain is nucleated and propagates part way into the sample ; but it dies before reaching the receiving contact or merging with the larger domain . at even larger bias values",
    "the second domain merges with the primary domain near the receiving contact and this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ ext.p2 ] which corresponds to @xmath27 v / cm . again the current is plotted on the far right of the figure . when the first domain reaches the receiving contact the current increases . instead of immediately starting the nucleation of a new wave , the area lost by the dying wave",
    "is gained by the trailing wave  note that the width of the trailing wave increases after the leading wave starts to disappear .",
    "the current increases , reaching a local maximum just before the trailing domain touches the leading domain , that is , the fronts collide .",
    "the current increases abruptly after the front collision and it rises to a global maximum at which point a new domain begins to nucleate at the injecting contact .",
    "as the domain forms , the current decreases and reaches a minimum at which point a new domain detaches and begins to propagate .",
    "then the current increases until a second smaller domain is nucleated .",
    "finally , the current settles to a rather low constant level as the two domains move steadily and in unison across the interior region of the sample .",
    "current behavior is apparently dominated by the major events involving the fronts : collisions with the contacts or with each other .",
    "this suggests the viability of a dynamical model that focuses on discrete front motions and the current @xmath4 .    at larger biases ,",
    "the portion of the sample occupied by the high field value @xmath28 is larger , reducing the separation between domains , and giving more complicated @xmath3 structure and @xmath29 behavior . in fig .",
    "[ ext.ch1 ] we show a space - time plot and current for what appears to be a chaotic state for an applied bias of @xmath30 v / cm .",
    "the spatiotemporal dynamics possess a great deal of structure and complexity .",
    "the process of multiple domain shedding is similar to that for the previous case .",
    "the large current peaks correspond to nucleation of leading domains .",
    "the leading domains cross the sample without catching up or forward - colliding with any other high field regions , and are indicated by dark regions that extend all the way across the space - time diagram .",
    "note also the larger spatial extent of the leading domains than in figs .",
    "[ ext.p1 ] and  [ ext.p2 ] .",
    "the aperiodicity of the current is reflected in the irregular appearance of the maximum current peaks or , equivalently , of the dark strips that extend across the entire sample . in between them",
    "are a number of local maxima corresponding to the shedding of trailing domains .    figure  [ phase ] ( a ) shows a bifurcation diagram in which we plot all values of successive current maxima as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "an important feature in this diagram is the apparent presence of windows of chaotic behavior with a large number of points being visited . for periodic states we see a small number of points corresponding to perfectly repeating current maxima .",
    "also , in the periodic regimes there are points where various branches merge or disappear and these correspond to the development or destruction of trailing domains . for the parameter values selected here we do not observe period doubling .",
    "we conjecture that the route to chaos here is of boundary crisis type in which the attractor collides with a periodic orbit on its basin boundary @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ phase ] ( b ) we show the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath32 versus @xmath31 for the reduced drift - diffusion model .",
    "this unambiguously confirms the presence of chaos in the `` chaotic '' windows .",
    "the next two exponents have been calculated and are never positive , so that the chaos we see is of a low - dimensional variety . to compute the exponents",
    ", we used an algorithm outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite adapted for use with partial differential equations and using adaptive control of the integration time step @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath32 are zero in the periodic regimes as they should be for periodic behavior . the smallness of @xmath32 in the chaotic regime is easily understood by recalling the period of the system , about 1000 non - dimensional time units .",
    "this indicates that the chaos originates in processes that occur on time scales on the order of the front transit time across the sample . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first time that chaos due to multiple shedding of wavefronts has been observed in a drift - diffusion model of this type .",
    "this type of chaotic behavior has not been reported for experiments on p - ge with time - independent voltage bias , most likely because experimentally studied samples were too short , biases were not sufficiently large , or contact resistivity was too low . however , in early experimental studies of the gunn effect in gaas , j. b. gunn @xcite observed that for long samples current oscillations were almost completely random , resembling white noise .",
    "he also found that short samples produce aperiodic oscillations when circuit impedance is sufficiently large .",
    "it is plausible that gunn may have observed a similar form of chaos to the one we have found numerically . in the next section we develop an asymptotic model in which the chaotic dynamics is understood to arise from the aperiodic nucleation of fronts at the injecting contact .",
    "the asymptotic model used in this paper consists of describing the evolution of the current when all wavefronts are detached from the injecting contact by an appropriate ordinary differential equation ( _ ode _ ) for @xmath23 , tracking the position of the wavefronts and proposing a simplified mechanism for creation and destruction of wavefronts . while our new model is compatible with the asymptotic calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have not rigorously derived it from these calculations . instead , we have proposed a simplified dynamics to account for our numerical observations motivated by asymptotic results .",
    "we begin by assuming that @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ j_sh ] and that @xmath34 .",
