    "<S> the argument to do so is different from the one proving additivity of @xmath34 of the channel ( which we can not do for @xmath117 ) , and also from the use of the recent continuity bound  @xcite ( which can not be applied as @xmath117 is at finite distance from any channel for which we know the capacity ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we even get a new type of example for the non - additivity of the quantum capacity @xmath118 , which is different from smith and yard s  @xcite as our channel is not ppt entanglement binding . furthermore , while in  @xcite the lower bound of half the private capacity on the quantum capacity of the tensor product was enough , here we experience even a large gap between these two quantities . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also note a conceptual analogy in the constructions : the ppt entanglement binding channel used in  @xcite derives from a so - called _ pbit state _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it provides alice and bob with shared randomness  which is made private by distributing the purification among alice and bob , but in a scrambled way that makes it impossible for them to recover much of the entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> our channel randomizes the environment and hence gives it to bob in an encrypted way , limiting the receiver s knowledge about the noise encountered by the channel . in the construction of  @xcite as in the present one , the availability of additional resources allows alice and bob to break the encryption and access the entanglement .    * acknowledgments . </S>",
