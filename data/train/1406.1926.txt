    "measurements of the exclusive double - charmonium production cross section @xmath6 by the belle @xcite and _ babar _ @xcite collaborations have stimulated a good deal of theoretical activity .",
    "calculations within the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism @xcite at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath2 and @xmath7 @xcite yield values for the production cross section that lie almost an order of magnitude below the measured values . here , @xmath2 is the strong coupling and @xmath7 is the velocity of the charm quark ( @xmath8 ) or charm antiquark ( @xmath9 ) in the charmonium rest frame .",
    "calculations at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath2  @xcite and nlo in @xmath10 @xcite seem to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "however , the large nlo corrections raise issues about the convergence of the @xmath2 and @xmath7 expansions . in the case of the @xmath7 expansion , the large nlo corrections arise from several sources , each of which contributes a modest correction that is consistent with a convergent expansion @xcite . in the case of the @xmath2 expansion , the nlo contribution produces a correction of about 100% .",
    "it has been pointed out that the bulk of the nlo correction at @xmath3-factory energies arises from double logarithms of @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the square of the @xmath11-center - of - momentum energy and @xmath5 is the charm - quark mass @xcite .",
    "this suggests that one might gain control of the @xmath2 expansion by resumming the large double ( and single ) logarithms of @xmath0 .",
    "the standard tool for the resummation of logarithms in exclusive processes is the light - cone formalism @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution of light - cone distributions of mesons produces only single logarithms and , so , does not control the double logarithms that appear in nlo amplitude for @xmath12 .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the double logarithms could be related to end - point singularities in the light - cone hard - scattering kernels .",
    "our analysis confirms this conjecture .    in this paper",
    "we identify the loop - momentum regions that give rise to the singularities in the double logarithms of @xmath0 that appear in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "( an abbreviated discussion of these double logarithms and the associated singularities was given in ref .",
    "we find that the singularities that are associated with the large double logarithms arise from both the sudakov region and the end - point region of the loop - momentum integration .",
    "the sudakov logarithms cancel in the sum over feynman diagrams .",
    "our results for the double logarithms agree diagram by diagram with those that were obtained in the complete nlo calculations in refs .",
    "a new insight that follows from our analysis is that the end - point singularity corresponds to a pinch - singular region of the loop - momentum integration in which a spectator - quark line becomes either soft or soft and collinear .",
    "( our nomenclature is that the active - quark line is the quark line to which the virtual photon attaches and that the spectator - quark line is the other quark line . )",
    "this pinch singularity has a ( logarithmically ) divergent power count by virtue of the fact that the process @xmath14 proceeds through a helicity flip .",
    "the insight that the end - point singularity corresponds to a soft - quark pinch - singular region could have important implications for the all - orders factorization of the infrared singularities for this process and for the resummation of the associated logarithms .. ]    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "according to the nrqcd factorization formalism  @xcite , the amplitude for the process @xmath1 can be written as a sum of products of short - distance coefficients ( sdcs ) with nrqcd long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) .",
    "the double logarithms of @xmath0 that are the focus of this paper appear in the single sdc that arises in the nrqcd factorization expression for the amplitude at lo in @xmath7 .",

    "this sdc can be obtained perturbatively by comparing the full - qcd amplitude @xmath16 $ ] with the nrqcd expression for the amplitude .",

    "therefore , in our calculation , we focus on the full - qcd amplitude @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the process @xmath21 consists of the process @xmath22 , followed by the process @xmath23 . because the process @xmath22 does not receive qcd corrections in relative order @xmath24 , we need to consider only the amplitude @xmath25 $ ] in order to compute the nlo corrections relative to the lo amplitude .",

    "the process @xmath29 does not satisfy quark - helicity conservation . in order to produce a helicity flip ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath28 must contain at least one numerator factor @xmath5 .",
    "it follows that the amplitude is suppressed by a factor of @xmath30 relative to a helicity - conserving amplitude . in our calculation , we retain all numerator terms that are proportional to powers of @xmath5 , except as noted .",
    "we also keep @xmath5 nonzero in denominators in order to regulate singularities .",
    "our strategy in analyzing the double logarithms in @xmath28 is to examine the double - logarithmic singularities that appear in the limit @xmath13 . in characterizing these singularities ,",
    "we ignore powers of @xmath5 in the coefficients of the logarithms . from a general landau analysis of pinch singularities",
    "@xcite , we expect singularities to arise from regions of loop momentum in which an internal line is soft and/or collinear to an external line . if @xmath5 is nonzero",
    ", then there is no pinch when internal quark lines are soft or collinear or when internal gluon lines are collinear .",
    "however , there can still be a pinch when an internal gluon line is soft .",
    "we regulate these soft singularities by using dimensional regularization in @xmath31 dimensions .",
    "the soft singularities then produce single poles in @xmath32 .",
    "the amplitudes that we consider are ultraviolet ( uv ) finite . however , after we reduce tensor integrals to scalar integrals , individual terms can contain uv divergences , which we also regulate dimensionally and which also produce single poles in @xmath32 .",
    "these uv divergences cancel in the sum of the contributions from each feynman diagram .",
    "although we work in @xmath31 dimensions , we evaluate dirac traces and numerator algebra in four dimensions .",
    "that simplification does not affect the calculation of the double logarithms of @xmath5 because terms of order @xmath32 in the numerator can contribute only in conjunction with a soft pole or a uv pole .",
    "the coefficient of a soft pole can contain only a single ( collinear ) logarithm of @xmath5 , while the coefficient of a uv pole can not contain any logarithm of @xmath5 . following this procedure for the numerator algebra",
    ", we reproduce all of the double logarithms of @xmath5 that appear in the exact nlo calculation of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will see that the double logarithmic singularities that appear in the limit @xmath13 arise from two sources .",
    "one source is a region of loop momentum in which the momentum of a gluon becomes both soft and collinear .",
    "this is the `` sudakov '' region .",
    "a second source is a region of loop momentum in which one gluon carries away almost all of the momentum of a spectator quark and the other gluon carries away almost all of the momentum of a spectator antiquark .",
    "this is the `` end - point '' region .",
    "as we will show , the end - point region can also be characterized as a momentum region in which a spectator - quark line becomes either soft or soft and collinear . in a general analysis of pinch singularities ,",
    "such a momentum configuration produces a pinch .",
    "furthermore , as is evident from our calculation , in order @xmath30 , the pinch has the correct power counting to produce a ( logarithmic ) singularity .",
    "in contrast , in order @xmath33 , this same pinch does not have the correct power counting to produce a singularity .",
    "consequently , end - point momentum configurations do not play a role in non - helicity - flip processes at the leading nontrivial order in @xmath30 .",
    "in this section , we evaluate the double logarithms that appear in the nlo qcd corrections to the amplitude @xmath34 , and we identify the momentum regions that are associated with the double - logarithmic singularities in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "first , we describe the kinematics , conventions , and nomenclature that we use in calculating the double logarithms and throughout this paper .",
    "we work in the feynman gauge .",
    "we use the light - cone momentum coordinates @xmath35= [ ( k^0+k^3)/\\sqrt{2},(k^0-k^3)/\\sqrt{2},\\bm{k}_\\perp]$ ] and work in the @xmath11-center - of - momentum frame . because our calculation is at lo in @xmath7 , we set the relative momentum of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 in each charmonium equal to zero",

    "hence , @xmath52 is collinear to plus and @xmath53 is collinear to minus in the limit @xmath54 .    the amplitudes that we compute contain spin and color projectors that put the @xmath55 pairs into states of definite spin and color  @xcite .",

    "in addition , by making use of the identity ( [ projector - gluon2 ] ) with @xmath120 , we can see that the contributions of the diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig : oneloop](b ) and [ fig : oneloop](c ) contain an additional factor of @xmath150 from the outermost active - quark propagator and that the contribution of the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloop](d ) contains two additional factors of @xmath150 from the two active - quark propagators .",
    "otherwise , these contributions would vanish because there would be two factors of @xmath239 or two factors of @xmath240 that are adjacent or are separated by @xmath235 .",
    "these numerator factors of @xmath150 are sufficient to eliminate the soft singularity in the contributions of each of the diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig : oneloop](a)[fig : oneloop](f ) , [ fig : oneloop](k ) , and [ fig : oneloop](l ) .",
    "we have verified this analysis by carrying out explicit calculations of the contributions of each diagram .",
    "arguments that are similar to the preceding one apply to situations in which one or both mesons are spin - one states .",
    "the conclusion is that , at leading order in @xmath30 , for processes that do not involve a helicity flip , there are no singularities that arise from the region in which the spectator quark carries a soft or a soft - collinear momentum ( end - point singularities ) .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with explicit calculations for helicity nonflip processes @xcite and with general analyses of leading pinch singularities @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed double logarithms of @xmath0 that appear in the nlo qcd corrections to the process @xmath241 .",
    "we have identified the origins of these double logarithms by examining , in the limit @xmath13 , the pinch singularities in the contours of integration in the amplitudes .",
    "we have found that the double logarithms are of two types : sudakov double logarithms and end - point double logarithms .",
    "the sudakov double logarithms are characterized by singularities in the limit @xmath13 that arise from a momentum region in which the momentum of a gluon is both soft and collinear to one of the outgoing mesons .",
    "the end - point double logarithms are characterized by singularities in the limit @xmath13 that arise from a momentum region in which one gluon carries away almost all of the momentum of a spectator quark and the other gluon carries away almost all of the momentum of a spectator antiquark .",
    "we have carried out an explicit calculation that shows that the sudakov and end - point double logarithms account for all of the double logarithms that arise from each feynman diagram .    when one sums over the contributions of all of the diagrams , the sudakov double logarithms cancel .",
    "we have shown that this cancellation can be understood by means of a general argument that is based on a soft - collinear approximation and graphical ward identities .",
    "we have found that the end - point singular region can be interpreted as a pinch - singular region in which the momentum of the spectator - quark line is both soft and collinear .",
    "such a pinch - singular region is allowed by a general landau analysis . however , in the case of processes that proceed without a helicity flip , it does not give rise to a singular power count at leading order in @xmath30 . in the case of processes that proceed only through a helicity flip , such as @xmath242 ,",
    "the end - point singular region can give rise to a singular power , owing to the presence of one or more factors of @xmath5 in numerators of feynman amplitudes at the leading nontrivial order in @xmath30 .",
    "we have given a general analysis of the power counting in the end - point singular region at nlo in @xmath2 .",
    "that analysis shows that the end - point singularities can produce logarithms of @xmath5 , but not inverse powers of @xmath5 .",
    "it is apparent that the end - point region can give rise to single logarithms of @xmath0 , as well as double logarithms .",
    "the single logarithms correspond to a region of integration in which the momentum of a spectator - quark line is soft , but not collinear .",
    "finally , we remark that the insight that the end - point singular region is a pinch - singular region in which a spectator - quark line is either soft or soft collinear might allow one to make progress in organizing end - point singularities to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we note that scet , as it is presently formulated @xcite , does not include modes in which quarks are soft , and so it would be necessary to augment scet in order to apply it to the end - point region . the all - orders organization of end - point singularities , in the context of scet or in the context of traditional diagrammatic approaches , would be a key ingredient in the resummation of the end - point logarithms .",
    "we are grateful to yu jia and xiu - ting yang for providing us with diagram - by - diagram results for the logarithms in the calculation of ref .",
