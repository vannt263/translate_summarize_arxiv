    "the knowledge of nonperturbative dynamics of susy gauge theories advanced significantly after the realization of how powerful the restrictions imposed by holomorphy are  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that holomorphy and symmetries are sufficient to determine the vacuum structure of a large number of supersymmetric theories .",
    "the full lagrangian of @xmath0 theories contains both holomorphic and non - holomorphic quantities , but only the holomorphic ones can be determined beyond what is possible to compute in perturbation theory .",
    "there are two kinds of holomorphic quantities in @xmath0 theories : the superpotential and the coefficient of the gauge - kinetic term .",
    "symmetry restrictions and compatibility with various limits are often powerful enough to determine the exact form on nonperturbatively generated superpotentials .",
    "the gauge - kinetic term is important only when the gauge degrees of freedom are present in the infrared . when the gauge group is broken or exhibits confinement , there are no light vector bosons in the spectrum .",
    "the field dependent coefficient of the gauge - kinetic term can be determined using the electric - magnetic duality , for which explicit transformations are only known in the abelian case . for non - abelian theories we have limited results about duality .",
    "the non - abelian version of duality relates theories which flow to the same infrared fixed point and also gives a mapping between the gauge - invariant operators  @xcite .",
    "so far , the examples of non - abelian duality are known only in isolated cases , but no general arguments for finding dual theories have been found .",
    "we will not discuss theories related by such a duality here . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 theories can be studied systematically in a wide range of other nonperturbative phenomena including confinement , abelian duality , quantum deformation of moduli spaces , lifting of the moduli space due to dynamically - generated superpotentials .",
    "we will describe these phenomena in theories based on simple gauge groups without tree - level superpotentials .",
    "the classical moduli space of supersymmetric gauge theories can be described by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of gauge - invariant polynomials on the space of chiral superfields . for any given theory , there is always a minimal set of such polynomials which parameterizes the moduli space .",
    "some of the operators in the minimal set can be subject to constraints , which are polynomials in the operators .",
    "the choice of the basic set of gauge invariants is not unique , but the number of such invariants in the minimal set and the number of constraints among them is unique in a given theory .",
    "we now describe the restrictions imposed by symmetries on the form of the dynamically - generated superpotential .",
    "the @xmath1 charges must be chosen so that the symmetry is free of anomalies . for example , the @xmath2 charge has to obey @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the r charge of the @xmath5-th fermion representation , @xmath6 the respective dynkin index , and @xmath7 is the dynkin index of the adjoint representation . in our conventions",
    "gauginos carry r charge one . since we consider theories with no tree - level superpotential , there are as many non - anomalous global @xmath1 s as chiral superfields .",
    "these symmetries restrict the dynamically generated superpotential to be of the form  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 . depending on the sign of @xmath10 the characteristic scale of the theory , @xmath11 , appears in the numerator or the denominator of the above equation .",
    "when @xmath12 a superpotential can not be generated since all fields carry zero r charge , while the superpotential must have r charge of two .",
    "we will now discuss nonperturbative phenomena dividing theories according to the value of @xmath10 .",
    "an example of theory with with @xmath14 is supersymmetric @xmath15 with @xmath16 fields @xmath17 in the fundamental representation and @xmath18 in the antifundamental representation .",
    "this theory was found  @xcite to confine without breaking chiral symmetries .",
    "massless fields of the confined theory are the mesons @xmath19 and the baryons @xmath20 , @xmath21 . when @xmath22 the superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ superpot ] ) has fields in the numerator and the scale @xmath11 in the denominator .",
    "the limit @xmath23 seems to give a singularity which is not present in the classical theory .",
    "therefore , most theories with @xmath22 can not generate a superpotential .",
    "nevertheless , supersymmetric qcd with @xmath16 generates a superpotential of the form @xmath24 this superpotential has a consistent classical limit because of constraints among the mesons and baryons .",
    "the equations of motions reproduce precisely the classical constraints among the @xmath25 s , @xmath26 s and @xmath27 s . thus , the numerator of the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ qcd ] ) vanishes identically in the classical limit , and the singular behavior is avoided .",
    "the moduli spaces of the classical and quantum theories are identical since the equations of motion of the quantum theory reproduce the classical constraints .",
    "for example , the point where none of the operators has vevs belongs to the quantum moduli space . at this point none of the global symmetries",
    "is broken , and one can verify that the t  hooft anomaly matching conditions are saturated by the mesons and baryons .",
    "it is possible to identify other theories which confine without chiral symmetry breaking and whose classical and quantum moduli spaces are identical .",
    "constraints present in the classical theory have to be reproduced by the equations of motion of the superpotential .",
    "all such theories , termed s - confining , can be found in a systematic manner  @xcite .",
    "the confining phase of such theories is continuously connected to their respective higgs phase . for vevs much larger than the characteristic scale , at generic points on the moduli space of theories with",
    "@xmath22 the gauge group is completely broken  @xcite .",
    "thus the low - energy degrees of freedom are the fields that are not eaten by the higgs mechanism .",
    "these are parameterized by the gauge invariants made out of chiral superfields .",
    "since there is no phase transition between the higgs and confining phases , the same fields must comprise the infrared spectrum of the theory near the origin .",
    "we now summarize the arguments that allow to identify the s - confining theories  @xcite .",
    "first , the confining and higgs phases are indistinguishable whenever sources in all possible representations can be screened by massless dynamical fields .",
    "this requires that an s - confining theory has at least one field in a faithful representation .",
    "second , the superpotential must be smooth at the origin .",
    "comparison with eq .",
    "( [ superpot ] ) implies that @xmath14 . a singularity of the superpotential would indicate that additional massless states are present",
    "these two conditions limit the number of candidate theories to a relatively short list .",
    "the last criterion also comes form the fact that the same massless fields are present on the entire moduli space . giving vevs to some of the fields , such",
    "that the gauge group is only partially broken , leads to new effective theories .",
    "but these new theories should also be described in terms of gauge invariant operators alone . in other words ,",
    "an s - confining theory has to flow to an s - confining theory .",
    "let us see how this works in practice .",

    "the nonperturbative phenomena exhibited by those theories are confinement with or without chiral symmetry breaking , abelian coulomb phase , and dynamical generation of superpotentials .",
