    "processing information using quantum two - level systems ( qubits ) , instead of classical two - state systems ( bits ) , has lead to many striking results such as the teleportation of unknown quantum states and quantum algorithms that are exponentially faster than their known classical counterpart . given a quantum computer , shor s factoring algorithm would render many of the currently used encryption protocols completely insecure , but as a countermeasure , quantum information processing has also given quantum cryptography .",
    "quantum key distribution was invented by bennett and brassard ( bb84 ) , to provide a new type of solution to one of the most important cryptographic problems : the transmission of secret messages .",
    "a key distributed via quantum cryptography techniques can be secure even against an eavesdropper with unlimited computing power , and the security is guaranteed forever .",
    "the conventional setting is as follows : alice and bob have labs that are perfectly secure , they use qubits for their quantum communication , and they have access to a classical communication channel which can be heard , but can not be jammed ( i.e.  can not be tampered with ) by the eavesdropper . the last assumption can easily be justified if alice and bob can broadcast messages , or if they already share some small number of secret bits in advance , to authenticate the classical channel .    in the well - known bb84 protocol as well as in all other qkd protocols",
    "prior to  @xcite , both alice and bob perform quantum operations on their qubits ( or on their quantum systems ) .",
    "the question of how much `` quantum '' a protocol needs to be in order to achieve a significant advantage over all classical protocols is of great interest .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss whether entanglement is necessary for quantum computation , @xcite shows nonlocality without entanglement , and @xcite discuss how much of the information carried by various quantum states is actually classical .",
    "this discussion was extended into the _ quantum cryptography _ domain in  @xcite where we presented and analyzed a protocol in which one party ( bob ) is classical . for our purposes ,",
    "any two orthogonal states of the quantum two - level system can be chosen to be the computational basis @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for reasons that will soon become clear",
    ", we shall now call the computational basis `` classical '' and we shall use the classical notations @xmath2 to describe the two quantum states @xmath3 defining this basis . in the protocols we discuss , a quantum channel travels from alice s lab to the outside world and back to her lab .",
    "bob can access a segment of the channel , and whenever a qubit passes through that segment bob can either let it go undisturbed or ( 1 ) measure the qubit in the classical @xmath2 basis ; ( 2 ) prepare a ( fresh ) qubit in the classical basis , and send it ; ( 3 ) reorder the qubits ( by using different delay lines , for instance ) .",
    "if all parties were limited to performing only operations ( 1)(3 ) , or doing nothing , they would always be working with qubits in the classical basis , and could never obtain any quantum superposition of the computational - basis states ; the qubits can then be considered `` classical bits '' ; the resulting protocol would then be equivalent to an old - fashion classical protocol , and therefore , the operations themselves shall here be considered classical .",
    "we term this kind of protocol `` qkd protocol with classical bob '' or semi - quantum key distribution ( sqkd ) .",
    "we discuss and analyze two different variants of such a protocol . in one bob",
    "performs operations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) or transfer the qubit back to alice ; this variant is therefore named _ measure - resend sqkd_. the other variant is based on randomization and named _ randomization - based sqkd_. in this variant bob is restricted to perform operations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , or do nothing .",
    "this work extends the results of  @xcite , by first generalizing the conditions under which the results of  @xcite hold for the _ measure - resend sqkd _ , specifically , proving that robustness still holds when the qubits are sent one by one and are attacked collectively .",
    "in addition we define and analyze a _ randomization - based sqkd _ which leaks no information at all and results with a secret string with entropy exponentially close to its length . we provide a full proof of robustness for this variant as well .",
    "to define our protocols we follow the definition ( see for instance  @xcite ) of the most standard qkd protocol , bb84 .",
    "the bb84 protocol consists of two major parts : a first part that is aimed at creating a _ sifted key _ , and a second ( fully classical ) part aimed at extracting an error - free , secure , _ final key _ from the sifted key . in the first part of bb84",
    ", alice randomly selects a binary value and randomly selects in which basis to send it to bob , either the computational ( `` @xmath4 '' ) basis @xmath3 , or the hadamard ( `` @xmath5 '' ) basis @xmath6 .",
    "bob measures each qubit in either basis at random .",
    "an equivalent description is obtained if alice and bob use only the classical operations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above and the hadamard ; @xmath7 . ] quantum gate @xmath8 . after all qubits have been sent and measured , alice and bob publish which bases they used . for approximately half of the qubits alice and bob used mismatching bases and these qubits",
    "are discarded .",
    "the values of the rest of the bits make the sifted key .",
    "the sifted key is identical in alice s and bob s hands if the protocol is error - free and if there is no eavesdropper ( known as eve ) trying to learn the shared bits or some function of them . in the second part",
    "alice and bob use some of the bits of the sifted key ( the @xmath9 bits ) to test the error - rate , and if it is below some pre - agreed threshold , they select an @xmath10 string from the rest of the sifted key . finally , an error correcting code ( ecc ) is used to correct the errors on the @xmath10 string ( the @xmath10 bits ) , and privacy amplification ( pa ) is used to derive a shorter but unconditionally secure final key from these @xmath10 bits . at that point",
    "we would like to mention a key feature relevant to our protocols : it is sufficient to use qubits in just one basis , @xmath4 , for generating the @xmath10 string , while the other basis is used only for finding the actions of an adversary  @xcite .",
    "a conventional measure of security is the information eve can obtain on the final key , and a security proof usually calculates ( or puts bounds on ) this information .",
    "the strongest ( most general ) attacks allowed by quantum mechanics are called _",
    "joint attacks_. these attacks are aimed to learn something about the final ( secret ) key directly , by using a probe through which all qubits pass , and by measuring the probe after all classical information becomes public .",
    "security against all joint attacks is considered as `` unconditional security '' .",
    "the security of bb84 ( with perfect qubits sent from alice to bob ) against all joint attacks was first proven in  @xcite via various techniques .",
    "an important step in studying security is a proof of robustness ; see for instance @xcite for robustness proof of the entanglement - based protocol , and @xcite for a proof of robustness against the photon - number - splitting attack .",
    "robustness of a protocol means that any adversarial attempt to learn some information necessarily induces some disturbance .",
    "it is a special case ( in zero noise ) of the more general ",
    "information versus disturbance \" measure which provides explicit bound on the information available to eve as a function of the induced error .",
    "robustness also generalizes the no - cloning theorem : while the no - cloning theorem states that a state can not be cloned , robustness means that any attempt to make an imprint of a state ( even an extremely weak imprint ) necessarily disturbs the quantum state .",
    "a protocol is said to be _ completely robust _ if nonzero information acquired by eve on the @xmath10 string implies nonzero probability that the legitimate participants find errors on the bits tested by the protocol .",
    "a protocol is said to be _ completely nonrobust _ if eve can acquire the @xmath10 string without inducing any error on the bits tested by the protocol .",
    "a protocol is said to be _ partly robust _ if eve can acquire some limited information on the @xmath10 string without inducing any error on the bits tested by the protocol .",
    "partially robust protocols could still be secure , yet completely nonrobust protocols are automatically proven insecure .",
    "see also fig .",
    "[ fig : robustness ] .",
    "as one example , bb84 is fully robust when qubits are used by alice and bob but it is only partly robust if photon pulses are used and sometimes two - photon pulses are sent .",
    "the well known two - state protocol ( also called bennett92 protocol ) is not fully robust even if perfect qubits are used , if realistic channel losses are taken into account .",
    "such partly robust protocols can still lead to a secure final key if enough bits are sacrified for privacy amplification . on the other hand ,",
    "such partly robust protocols can become completely nonrobust ( and therefore totally insecure ) if the loss rate is sufficiently high .",
    "string vs. the allowed disturbance on the bits tested by alice and bob , in a completely robust ( solid line ) , partly robust ( dashed ) , and completely nonrobust ( densely dotted ) protocol .",
    "( b ) robustness should not be confused with security ; eve s maximum information on the _ final _ key vs. allowed disturbance in a secure protocol ; such a protocol could be completely or partly robust . ]",
    "consider the following mock protocol : alice flips a coin to decide whether to send a random bit in the computational basis @xmath3 ( `` @xmath4 '' ) , or in the hadamard basis @xmath6 ( `` @xmath5 '' ) .",
    "bob flips a coin to decide whether to measure alice s qubit in the computational basis ( to `` @xmath11 '' it ) or to reflect it back ( `` @xmath12 '' ) , without causing any modification to the information carrier . in case",
    "alice chose @xmath4 and bob decided to @xmath11 , i.e.  to measure in the @xmath4 basis , they share a random bit that we call @xmath11 or sifted bit ( that may , or may not , be confidential ) . in case bob",
    "chose @xmath12 , alice can check if the qubit returned unchanged , by measuring it in the basis she sent it . in",
    "case bob chose to @xmath11 and alice chose the @xmath5 basis , they discard that bit .",
    "the idea that just one basis , the @xmath4-basis , is sufficient for the key generation ( while the other basis is used for finding the actions of an adversary ) appeared already in @xcite .",
    "the above iteration is repeated for a predefined number of times . at the end of the quantum part of the protocol alice and bob share , with high probability , a considerable amount of @xmath11 bits ( also known as the `` sifted key '' ) . in order to make sure that eve can not gain much information by measuring ( and resending ) all qubits in the @xmath4 basis",
    ", alice can check whether they have a low - enough level of discrepancy on the @xmath5-basis @xmath12 bits . in order to make sure that their sifted key is reliable , alice and bob must sacrifice a random subset of the @xmath11 bits , which we denote as @xmath9 bits , and remain with a string of bits which we call @xmath10 bits ( @xmath10 and @xmath9 are common in qkd , e.g. , in bb84 as previously described ) .    by comparing",
    "the value of the @xmath9 bits , alice and bob can estimate the error rate on the @xmath10 bits .",
    "if the error rate on the @xmath10 bits is sufficiently small , they can then use an appropriate error correction code ( ecc ) in order to correct the errors .",
    "if the error rate on the @xmath5-basis @xmath12 bits is sufficiently small , alice and bob can bound eve s information , and can then use an appropriate privacy amplification ( pa ) in order to obtain any desired level of privacy .    at first glance",
    ", this protocol may look like a nice way to transfer a secret bit from quantum alice to classical bob : it is probably resistant to opaque ( intercept - resend ) attacks .",
    "however , it is _ completely non - robust _ ; eve could learn all bits of the @xmath10 string using a trivial attack that induces no error on the bits tested by alice and bob ( the @xmath9 and @xmath12 bits ) .",
    "she would not measure the incoming qubit , but rather perform a cnot from it into a @xmath13 ancilla into @xmath14 '' we mean that @xmath15 is the control qubit and @xmath14 is the target , as is commonly called ; we prefer to use the term `` control qubit '' in a different meaning in our paper . ] .",
    "if alice chose @xmath4 and bob decides to @xmath11 ( i.e.  measures in the @xmath4-basis ) , she measures her ancilla and obtains an exact copy of their common bit , thus inducing no error on @xmath9 bits and learning the @xmath10 string .",
    "if , however , bob decides on @xmath12 , i.e.  reflects the qubit , eve would do another cnot from the returning qubit into her ancilla .",
    "this would reset her ancilla , erase the interaction she performed , and induce no error on @xmath12 bits , thus removing any chance of her being caught . in the following section we present two protocols which overcome this problem via two different methods .",
