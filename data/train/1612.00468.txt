    "the study of supernova remnants ( snrs ) is of great interest in astrophysics .",
    "snrs can provide valuable information relevant to their stellar progenitors and the associated explosion events that end their stellar lives .",
    "the hot shocked gas in the interior of a snr is observed in x - rays , with a temperature @xmath21 kev .",
    "this temperature is determined by the physics of shocks and the evolutionary history of the interior of the supernova remnant .",
    "models , based on hydrodynamic simulations , can be constructed which represent a reasonable approximation of the evolution of a supernova remnant ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such models , together with the observed x - ray emission , can be used to deduce the explosion energy and the age of the snr and the density of its surroundings .",
    "an important in input required to carry out the modelling is the shock radius .",
    "this , in turn , requires knowledge of the snr s distance . for this reason ,",
    "this work considers snrs located in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the distance to the lmc is well determined at @xmath4 ( systematic ) kpc @xcite .",
    "lmc snrs also have been observed extensively in x - rays by xmm - newton @xcite . among their important results",
    "were : identification of sn type ( core collapse or type ia ) for number of snrs ; and measurement of lmc element abundances from snrs dominated by emission from shocked interstellar medium .",
    "the current paper further analyses the sample of lmc snrs from @xcite by applying the models from @xcite with some additional extensions and calculations .",
    "section 2 describes the data and the models that are used .",
    "section 3 gives the results for the derived explosion energies , ages and circum - stellar medium densities .",
    "section 4 discusses and summarizes the results .",
    "@xcite present the results of extensive xmm - newton observations of lmc snrs .",
    "they present x - ray images and spectral analysis results for 51 snrs . from this list",
    "we analyse all but sn1987a , for which our models do not apply , leaving a sample of 50 snrs .",
    "the primary data inputs for our analysis come from their tables c1 , e1 and e2 .",
    "in particular , the quantities of interest here are the outer shock radius , the temperature and the emission measure .",
    "the xmm - newton temperatures and emission measures are generally the best available values for these lmc snrs . in several cases chandra",
    "images are available with higher spatial resolution . for those cases we use the shock radius from the chandra images .    for modelling this sample , we make some simplifying assumptions",
    ". spherically symmetric snr evolution is assumed , which allows use of analytic approximations to snr evolution models .",
    "this assumption could be relaxed if carrying out multi - dimensional hydrodynamic models , but that is beyond the scope of the current work . as discussed in @xcite , prior to the onset of radiative cooling",
    ", spherically symmetric supernova remnant evolution can be described by unified solutions .",
    "these are more complex than self - similar solutions , but are analytic in nature .",
    "they describe the snr evolution ( forward and reverse shock evolution ) throughout the ejecta - dominated and sedov - taylor phases as well as the transition between the two phases . for the transition from sedov - taylor phase to the radiative phase we use the models of @xcite . for the circum - stellar medium",
    "we assume a uniform density .",
    "the ejecta density profiles are taken as power - law in radius with index n truelove and mckee ( 1999 ) present models for n=0 up to n=14 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is expected for a type ia explosion @xcite and @xmath7 for core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "the model emission measures for material heated by the forward shock , em , are calculated using the interior snr structure ( density , temperature and pressure profiles ) : @xmath8 . for the sedov - taylor phase ,",
    "we calculate the interior structure for the self - similar solution using the equations given in @xcite . for the ejecta dominated phase , we use the self - similar interior solutions given in @xcite for n=7 and n=12 cases . for the transition phase from ejecta to sedov - taylor",
    ", we calculate the interior structure using the formalism described in @xcite .",
    "we have tested models for different n on a few snrs in our sample and find that results differ by much less ( typically less than a few parts in 1000 ) than the differences caused by the uncertainties in the input parameters .",
    "thus the presented models are given for the n=7 case .",
    "tests were made using models with different values of ejected mass between 0.5 and 10 @xmath9 .",
    "again , the results differed by much less than differences caused by the uncertainties in the input parameters .",
    "thus the presented models are given for ejected mass of 1.4@xmath9 .",
    "the temperature of the x - ray spectrum of the outer shock component of a snr is the emission - weighted temperature . in the models we consider ,",
    "the temperature increases as radius decreases inside the shock front .",
    "thus the emission - weighted temperature is higher than the temperature at the shock front . at the shock",
    ", electrons and ions are heated to different temperatures .",
    "the initial heating per particle for a strong shock , with adiabatic index @xmath10 is @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is the mean molecular weight for the plasma @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the mean molecular weights for the ions and for the electrons .",
    "we use mean molecular weights corresponding to lmc abundances .    as the plasma ages the electrons and ions slowly equilibrate in temperature .",
    "we write @xmath16 with @xmath17 the electron to ion temperature ratio .",
    "the formalism of @xcite is used here to calculate @xmath18 as a function of time . for typical snr parameters",
    "( explosion energy @xmath19 erg , ejected mass of 1.4@xmath9 , density of 1 @xmath3 ) @xmath20 for age of 100 yr , increasing rapidly to 0.31 at age of 1000 yr , then more slowly , reaching 0.97 at 5000 yr .",
    "we find that to get realistic x - ray ( i.e. electron ) temperatures from the models , the inclusion of progressive equilibration of electron and ion temperatures ( i.e. @xmath18 ) is essential .",
    "the ionization states of the ions is generally out of equilibrium with the electron temperature for many snrs .",
    "however , this is already taken into account in modelling the x - ray spectra , so that the electron temperatures derived from the x - ray spectrum are corrected for this effect .",
    "for each snr in the lmc with observed radius , r , emission measure , em , and x - ray temperature , kt , an initial explosion energy , @xmath21 , age , and circum - stellar medium density , @xmath22 , were used to calculate a model .",
    "the process was iterated until convergence of the output r , em and kt to the observed values .",
    "the procedure is similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 , age and @xmath22 for each of the 50 snrs is listed in table 1 .",
    "the input r is also given .",
    "the input em and kt and their uncertainties are identical to those listed in @xcite so are not repeated here . to obtain uncertainties in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and age ,",
    "the models were rerun with em and kt set to the 4 different combinations of upper and lower limits .",
    "then the extreme values of @xmath21 , age and @xmath22 from this set of fits were used as the upper and lower limits .",
    "generally asymmetric errors on the parameters were obtained , as shown in table 1 here .",
    "there are wide ranges for the deduced values of @xmath21 , age and @xmath22 .",
    "the supernova ( sn ) explosion energies range from 0.037@xmath23 erg ( j0453 - 6829 ) to 11@xmath23 erg ( j0449 - 6920 ) , i.e by a factor of 300",
    ". such a wide range should not be surprising : the range in observed sn energies is similarly wide ( for type ii sn energies see @xcite ) .",
    "the deduced ages range from 1300 yr ( j0537 - 6910 ) to 60,000 yr ( j0517 - 6759 ) .",
    "this is in rough agreement with what is expected because snrs are expected to become too faint to observe after several @xmath24 yr .",
    "the deduced circum - stellar densities range from 0.0007 @xmath25 ( j0505 - 6753 ) to 5.5 @xmath25 ( j0453 - 6655 ) .",
    "this spans 4 orders of magnitude and is similar to what is expected for milky way snrs exploding in different environments , ranging from the hot ionized medium , with density @xmath26 , to the diffuse warm and cool hi , with density @xmath27 , to the molecular medium with density @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "1 shows the distribution of sn explosion energies , @xmath21 , derived here for the lmc snrs .",
    "@xmath21 for each snr is plotted as a function of cumulative number of snrs with energy less than or equal to @xmath21 , which is equal to the rank number by energy .",
    "the energies are clearly not uniformly distributed , otherwise the slope would be a straight line .",
    "other simple distribution functions , such as gaussian in energy , were tested and clearly do not fit the lmc sample values of @xmath21 . instead the distribution is reminiscent of a log - normal probability distribution : @xmath29 ^ 2}{2 \\sigma_{loge}^2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the total number in the sample , @xmath31 is peak in number vs. energy and @xmath32 the dispersion in log(e ) . the solid line in fig .",
    "1 is the best fit cumulative distribution , with parameters @xmath33erg and @xmath32=0.47 .",
    "the latter corresponds to a 1-@xmath1 dispersion of a factor 2.94 in energy .    the distribution of sn ages for the lmc snrs is shown in fig .",
    "age is plotted for each snr vs. cumulative number of snrs with age less than or equal to that of the given snr . in this case , for ages @xmath3420,000 yr , the distribution is uniformly distributed in age , and is well fit by a straight line . the slope of the line is the birthrate of snrs in our sample , which corresponds to observable x - ray snrs in the lmc .",
    "the derived birthrate is 1/(503yr ) , where the fit is done only for snrs with age @xmath3420,000 yr .",
    "the excess of ages for rank @xmath3540 can be attributed to incompleteness .",
    "i.e. , because the snrs with age@xmath3520,000 yr are becoming faint , the x - ray surveys are seeing only a fraction of the population . if we were observing all of the age@xmath3520,000 yr snrs ( say up to @xmath36yr ) , then the rank numbers would be larger , flattening the slope .",
    "we estimate the incompleteness by fitting a slope to the set with age rank between 40 and 50 .",
    "this gives a birthrate of 1/(4200yr ) , suggesting an incompleteness of a factor of @xmath378 for snrs with age between 20,000 and 60,000 yr compared to those with age @xmath3420,000 yr .",
    "including sn1987a in the sample has the following effect : the birthrate remains at 1/(503 yr ) but y - intercept of the line becomes 1060 yr instead of 1560 yr .",
    "this suggests that @xmath22 other young snrs are missing in the sample , possibly because confusion because of their small size .",
    "if we make the assumption that every observable sn produces an observable snr ( for age @xmath3420,000 yr ) , then the sn rate for the lmc is 1/(500 yr ) , which is about 1/10 that of the sn rate for the milky way .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the stellar luminosity of the lmc which is about 1/10 that of the milky way .",
    "the uncertainties in the sn rate of the milky way and the stellar luminosities of the lmc and milky way are large enough that a more detailed comparison is not possible .    as a separate test of the derived birthrate , we replace our derived ages with available estimates from the literature , as summarized in @xcite .",
    "previous estimates were available for 25 lmc snrs .",
    "we did not assess for each case whether the previous age estimates are more reliable or less reliable than the currently derived ages , in fact many of them are consistent with the same value .",
    "a detailed comparison for individual snrs will be done in a future paper .",
    "the resulting cumulative age distribution looks much the same as that shown in fig . 2 , but the fitted slope is lower , corresponding to a birth - rate of 1/(607 yr ) .",
    "we take the difference as a measure of the uncertainty in the lmc snr birthrate , i.e. @xmath21/(500 yr ) to @xmath21/(600 yr ) .",
    "future assessment of the methods of obtaining ages should reduce this uncertainty .",
    "3 shows the distribution of snr circum - stellar densities , @xmath22 .",
    "the densities are clearly not uniformly distributed . here",
    "we fit the @xmath22 distribution with a log - normal probability function : @xmath38 ^ 2}{2 \\sigma_{log(n_0)}^2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is peak in number vs. density and @xmath40 the dispersion in log(@xmath22 ) .",
    "the fit with a single log - normal distribution is poor but separate fits to the lower and upper sets of densities is good .",
    "the solid blue line is the best fit to the 30 lowest densities , with parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42=0.51 .",
    "the dashed red line is the best fit to the 30 highest densities , with parameters @xmath43 and @xmath42=0.91 .",
    "the @xmath1 s correspond to 1-@xmath1 dispersions of by factors of 3.2 and 8.2 in density .",
    "because the peak densities for both fits are so close to the same value , this suggests that there are not 2 physically distinct distributions of density .",
    "one possibility density distribution is not well - described by a log - normal distribution . this may not be surprising considering the complexity of processes that govern the densities in the ism ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the high density end of the distribution is under - sampled .",
    "snrs occurring in a high density medium evolve faster and become radiative at earlier times .",
    "thus they would be under - represented in the sample compared to longer - lived snrs occuring in lower density environments . in this case , the poor fit above density of @xmath44 would be explained by incompleteness .",
    "we calculated a mean age for the 30 snrs with lowest density of 21,000 yr , whereas the mean age of the 20 snrs with highest density is 12,000 yr .",
    "this supports the suggestion that the high density end of the sample is affected by incompleteness .    for the above work",
    ", the x - ray emission of the forward shock was analysed .",
    "it was noted that the results are very insensitive to the amount of ejected mass , @xmath45 , and to the index n for the power - law density distribution of the ejecta .",
    "however , the behaviour of the reverse shock is sensitive to both parameters .",
    "the snr evolution model is currently being improved to be able to model the reverse shocked ejecta for values of n between 0 and 14 .",
    "when the reverse shock model is completed , the x - ray emission from the reverse shock , which is seen in a number of the lmc snrs , can be modelled . that modelling will yield @xmath45 and n values for a sample of snrs and",
    "will enable us to learn about the properties of the sn progenitors .",
    "x - ray emission properties from the forward shock for a set of 50 snrs in the lmc has been determined recently by @xcite .",
    "here we have carried out snr evolution and interior structure calculations in order to match the observed radius , emission measure and electron temperature for each of the 50 snrs .",
    "the results for explosion energy , age and circum - stellar medium density , and their uncertainties , are given in table 1 .",
    "this is the first time that the energy distribution of snrs , the birthrate of snrs and the density distribution for snrs have been measured for any large sample .",
    "the distribution of parameters is summarized in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "for explosion energy and density , we fit the distributions by log - normal distributions . we find a most - probable explosion energy of @xmath0erg , with a 1-@xmath1 dispersion by factor 2.94 in energy . for density , two log - normal fits are better than one , which may be caused by complexity in the distribution of interstellar medium in the lmc or by incompleteness in the sample . in either case , the mean density is @xmath46 with a 1-@xmath1 dispersion by factor @xmath23 - 8 in density . for age",
    ", incompleteness is clearly a factor for the older part of the sample ( age @xmath3520,000 yr ) . for age",
    "@xmath3420,000 yr , the ages are well fit by a constant birthrate of 1/(500 yr )",
    ".    it would be highly desirable to carry out a similar study for galactic snrs .",
    "one of the main factors limiting such a study is lack of reliable distances to snrs in the galaxy .",
    "however , once a sample of galactic snrs with distances and x - ray observations is obtained , similar modelling can be carried out .",
    "then the properties of galactic and lmc snrs can be compared .",
