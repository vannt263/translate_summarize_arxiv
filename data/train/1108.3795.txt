    "<S> the centrality of the collision has been determined from the amplitude of the vzero signal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the total data sample available for physics analysis amounts to @xmath13 mb events . </S>",
    "<S> additional cuts have then been applied to improve the purity of the muon sample , in particular by requiring both particles in the pair to be detected in the muon trigger stations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we perform the cuts @xmath14 and @xmath15  cm , where @xmath16 is the radial coordinate of the track at the end of the hadronic absorber located in front of the spectrometer , to select muons in the geometrical acceptance of the detector .    </S>",

    "<S> the number of j/@xmath2 particles has been extracted by using two different methods . </S>",
    "<S> we have first fitted the opposite - sign dimuon invariant mass distribution with a crystal ball ( cb ) function ( a gaussian with polynomial tails ) to reproduce the j/@xmath2 shape and a sum of two exponentials to describe the underlying continuum ( fig .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we have subtracted the combinatorial background using the event - mixing technique and fitted the resulting mass distribution with a cb function and an exponential or a straight line to describe the remaining background ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mass]-right ) . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the j/@xmath2 mass peak depends on the resolution of the spectrometer which could , @xmath17 , be affected by the detector occupancy which increases with centrality . this effect has been evaluated by embedding simulated j/@xmath2 decays to muons into real events and no modification has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> such a conclusion has been confirmed by a direct measurement of the tracking chamber resolution versus centrality using reconstructed tracks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the same cb line shape can be used for all centrality classes . </S>",
    "<S> several parameters have been tested for the cb tails , either fixing them to the values obtained in p - p collisions ( where the signal over background ratio is more favorable ) or in simulations . for each of these choices , </S>",
    "<S> the mean and width of the gaussian part have been obtained by fitting the integrated mass distribution in the centrality range and then varying the width by @xmath18 1 standard deviation to account for uncertainties ( varying the mean has turned out to have negligible effect in comparison ) . </S>",
    "<S> the number of j/@xmath2 particles in each centrality class @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , as well as the ratios @xmath21 , have been determined as the average of the results obtained with the two fitting approaches and the various cb parameterizations , while the corresponding systematic uncertainties have been defined as two times the rms of these results , which also approximately corresponds to the maximum difference with respect to the mean value . </S>",
    "<S> the largest uncertainties have been obtained for the most central class and amount to 19% and 12% for @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .    in order to extract the inclusive j/@xmath2 yield , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 has been normalized to the number of mb events in the corresponding centrality class and further corrected for the branching ratio of the dimuon decay channel and the acceptance times efficiency ( @xmath24 ) of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> this latter quantity has been determined from mc simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the generated j/@xmath2 @xmath25 and @xmath26 distributions have been interpolated from existing measurements  @xcite , including shadowing effects from eks98 calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiencies of the muon trigger chambers have been measured directly from data then applied to the simulations . for the tracking apparatus , </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent status of each electronic channel and their run - by - run evolution have been taken into account as well as the residual misalignment of the detection elements . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtained a run - averaged value of @xmath27 , with a 7% relative systematic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the tracking efficiency with the detector occupancy has also been evaluated using the embedding technique . a small decrease of this efficiency when increasing the centrality ( @xmath28 in the most central class ) has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> this variation has been confirmed by a measurement of the tracking efficiency performed directly from data , and is included in the systematic uncertainties .    to measure the nuclear modification factors ( @xmath29 ) , the j/@xmath2 yield in the centrality class @xmath19 has been normalized to the inclusive j/@xmath2 cross - section measured in p - p collisions in the same rapidity domain at the same energy ( @xmath30 )  @xcite and scaled by the corresponding nuclear overlap function ( @xmath31 ) calculated using the glauber model , while the ratios @xmath21 have been normalized to the ratios @xmath32 to extract the central to peripheral nuclear modification factors ( @xmath33 ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath36 has been weighted by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath38 ) , which is expected to be the scaling variable of the j/@xmath2 production cross - section in a - a , in absence of nuclear matter effects . </S>",
    "<S> this correction is small , except for the most peripheral bin where @xmath36  =  46 while the weighted value is 70 . </S>",
    "<S> these results show no significant dependence on centrality , and the integrated @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the phenix measurements at @xmath37  gev  @xcite shows that the inclusive j/@xmath2 @xmath5 at 2.76  tev in the rapidity domain @xmath0 are clearly above those measured at 200  gev in @xmath40 , while they are closer to the midrapidity values at 200  gev ( except in the most central collisions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the b feed down to the j/@xmath2 production in our rapidity and @xmath25 domain has been measured to be @xmath41 in p - p collisions at @xmath42  tev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the difference between the prompt j/@xmath2 @xmath5 and our inclusive measurement is expected to be @xmath43 if the @xmath44 production scales with @xmath38 or smaller if it is suppressed by nuclear effects ( shadowing , ... ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the comparison of our j/@xmath2 @xmath6 results to the atlas measurements in the same centrality classes  @xcite indicates that the j/@xmath2 mesons measured at forward rapidity down to @xmath45 are less suppressed than the high-@xmath25 j/@xmath2 mesons at midrapidity ( 80% of the j/@xmath2 particles measured by atlas have a @xmath25 larger than 6.5 gev/@xmath46 ) .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> these results show a significant suppression of the inclusive j/@xmath2 production in pb - pb collisions at @xmath4  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with phenix results suggests that re - generation mechanisms could play a role . in order to provide tight constraints to suppression / regeneration models , </S>",
    "<S> a better knowledge of cnm effects is required , which can be obtained with a measurement of j/@xmath2 production in p - a collisions at the lhc . </S>"
