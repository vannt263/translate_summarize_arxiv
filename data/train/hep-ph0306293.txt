    "<S> within the framework of standard model , the exclusive decay mode @xmath0 is studied . </S>",
    "<S> although the usual short distance contribution is small compared to the similar @xmath1 mode , the process offers the possibility of studying the cp violation , a feature absent in the @xmath2 counterpart . + </S>",
    "<S> * keywords*:rare b decay + * pacs*:13.25.hw , 13.40.hq    introduction as has been emphasised time and again , because of very clean experimental signatures , radiative decays of the b - meson can serve to be very useful tools to test the underlying structure of the theory in question responsible for flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative decays , in particular , are very sensitive to higher order qcd corrections and any new physics effects beyond the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive decay mode @xmath3 as well as the exclusive mode @xmath4 have been experimentally measured and have invited a lot of theoretical attention . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the future b - factories should be able to make measurements of two photon modes . the quark level decay , @xmath5 has been studied in @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic amplitude in question receives contributions from the irreducible triangle diagram and the reducible pieces ( where the second photon is emitted by one of the external quark lines of a basic @xmath6 amplitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quark level amplitude is appropriate for the inclusive two photon process . for an exclusive channel , with some meson m in the final state , </S>",
    "<S> the reducible diagram is to be thought of as the one in which the second photon is attached to one of the external meson legs of the basic amplitude @xmath7 rather than the quark level process . </S>",
    "<S> it is then straighforward to note that this amplitude vanishes if the meson m in question is scalar or pseudoscalar . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for such cases , it suffices to consider the irreducible contribution only . </S>",
    "<S> apart from these short distance contributions , one can have the long distances contributions as well . </S>",
    "<S> of course , in the case of resonances contributing to any process , the resonant contribution is a reducible one . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the above , the demarcation between reducible and irreducible diagrams is more specific in that it is used for the usual short distance , non - resonant contribution only . </S>",
    "<S> the two photon process proceeding via @xmath8 transition has been recently studied @xcite and it has been pointed out that the long distance contributions can be of the same order , in fact sometimes larger , compared to the short distance irreducible contributions . </S>",
    "<S> + the present study extends these ideas to the decay @xmath0 proceeding via the transition @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for this mode suffers from ckm suppression when compared with the @xmath10 amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast to the @xmath11 process , @xmath12 channel offers the possibility of studying the cp asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the branching ratio and cp asymmetry for the process @xmath13 taking account of the irreducible contribution as well as all significant resonance contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> effective hamiltonian and irreducible triangle contribution the effective hamitonian relevant for a @xmath14 transition contributes to radiative processess through triangle diagrams with the photon being emitted by the quark loop and has the form @xcite _ eff & = & -v_td^*v_tbwith @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 o_5 = ( |d_ib_i)_v - a_q(|q_jq_j)_v+a , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and o_1^u = ( |d_iu_j)_v - a(|u_jb_i)_v - a o_2^u = ( |d_iu_i)_v - a(|u_jb_j)_v - a , in writing the effective hamiltonian , the unitarity of the ckm matrix has been used and the parameter @xmath22 is : _ </S>",
    "<S> u = in the wolfenstein parametrization of the ckm matrix , the above equation simply reads _ </S>",
    "<S> u = - + ......    a simple fierz rearrangement of @xmath23 and @xmath24 yields , o_1^u = -(|d_ib_i)_v - a(|u_ju_j)_v - a = -o_3(q = u ) and o_2^u = -(|d_ib_j)_v - a(|u_ju_i)_v - a = -o_4(q = u )    the effecive hamiltonian therefore becomes _ eff & = & -v_td^*v_tbin the above equation , @xmath25 simply implies that this term contributes only for the u - quark and there is no summation over repeated indices . </S>",
    "<S> + the quark level transition amplitude for @xmath26 ( with an incoming @xmath27 line and an outgoing @xmath28 line and the two photons being emitted by the quark loop ) is _ bd & = & |u(p_d)\\{_q a_qj(m_q^2)^p_l r _ + & + & b(m_dk(m_d^2)p_l + m_bk(m_b^2)p_r ) t _ + & + & c(-m_dl(m_d^2)p_l + m_bl(m_b^2)p_r ) _ </S>",

    "<S> we thus get , _ </S>",

    "<S> resonance contributions      the @xmath41 contribution comes via the decay @xmath44 , followed by @xmath41 decaying into two photons .    </S>",

    "<S> f_f_0(m_^2)(m_b^2-m__c^2 ) ) where a dipole form of the form factor @xmath53 is used .    </S>",

    "<S> analogous to @xmath41 , @xmath43 can also contribute via the effective hamiltonian , eq.(15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike @xmath41 , @xmath43 has a very strong coupling to a two gluon state . </S>",
    "<S> a number of theoretical models for @xmath43 production in b - decays via two gluon states have been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but these theoretical models have their own uncertainities attached to them . instead of relying on any such model </S>",
    "<S> , we directly use the experimental data for @xmath54 decay process @xcite and parametrise the @xmath43 resonance contribution as ( @xmath55 ) _ </S>",
    "<S> ^ = 2 b_^f(b^i^i^ ) _ </S>",
    "<S> 1^*^(k_1)_2^*^(k_2 ) _ k_1^k_2^ [ eq.etap ] where @xmath56 is defined as for @xmath41 with @xmath57 and the factor @xmath58 is related to the decay rate @xmath59 as : ( b^i^i^ ) = f(b^i^i^)^2 ^(1 , , ) the branching ratio for @xmath60 has also been measured @xcite and is found to be larger than the @xmath43 branching ratio . moreover , the branching ratio for @xmath42 to go into two photons is roughly @xmath61 times than that of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath42 channel is expected to contribute the largest . </S>",
    "<S> again , the amplitude can be directly read off from eq.([eq.etap ] ) by replacing the @xmath43 quantities by appropriate @xmath42 values .      </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62 meson contributes to the process in the following way :    @xmath63 followed by @xmath64 and the process with @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been emphasized @xcite that the weak - annihilation contribution to @xmath66 can be significant and thus we take into account this effect also while writing the @xmath66 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , ( p_)(k_1)tb(p_b)&= & -v_tbv_td^*^*(k_1 ) ^*(p _ ) ) + & &    where , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the parity conserving and parity violating form factors including the weak annihilation contributions as given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize the @xmath69 transition as ( p_)(k_2)t(p_)= g^i_^(p _ ) ^*(k_2)k_2^ p_^ _ and @xmath70 is determined from the corresponding decay rate .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the complete @xmath71 matrix element for the @xmath62 resonance can be written as t b&= & _ + & = & -v_tbv_td^*g^i _ </S>",

    "<S> the matrix elements for the @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be easily got from that of @xmath62 by making appropriate changes to quantities corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath73 and thus we do nt write the explicit expressions here . + the neutral mode also receives some contribution from @xmath74 via the annihilation diagram , which we expect to be small and do not include .    </S>",
    "<S> results it is worth mentioning that apart from the @xmath41 contribution , there is no handle for determing the relative sign of other matix elements . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces some amount of uncertainity in the result for the total decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> the differential decay rate is given by = ( ) ^_0^d   _ tot^2 where @xmath75 represents the complete matrix elemnt for the decay process including the resonance terms , @xmath76 is the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy of the two photons and @xmath77 denotes the angle which the decaying b - meson makes with one of the two photons in the @xmath78 c.m . </S>",
    "<S> frame . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the differential decay rate as a function of the invariant mass of the two photons for the charged mode . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 peaks show up at the corresponding mass values while the @xmath62 contribution gets spread over the whole range of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> further , the interference effects between the resonant and the irreducible contributions are very small , with the result that the results are practically independent of the relative sign parameters that one may have introduced for each of the resonance terms .    the total decay rate , including all resonance contributions for this process is calculated to be : @xmath79 we quote the individual contributions to the branching ratio : _ c 2 10 ^ -9 & & 2 10 ^ -9 + irreducible 3 10 ^ -8 & & interference 7 10 ^ -9 + 1.5 10 ^ -6 & & ^ 6 10 ^ -8    = 10.0 cm    the branching ratio for the neutral mode is also expected to be of similar magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the neutral mode gets additional , although small , ( @xmath80)-contributions from the @xmath72 and @xmath73 modes as well . </S>",
    "<S> more accurate statements can be made about the neutral mode once @xmath81 is observed . + as mentioned earlier , the process , although ckm suppressed , opens up the possibility of studying the cp asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we define the cp asymmetry as _ </S>",
    "<S> cp = with @xmath82 and @xmath83 denoting the decay rates for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resonances by themselves do not contribute to cp asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the ckm factors for them are dominantly real and in any case will be overall multiplicative factors unchanged while going from @xmath88 to @xmath89 when calculating the individual resonance contributions . </S>",
    "<S> however , there can be small contribution coming from the interference between the resonant and irreducible amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interference terms being rather small have been neglected in this analysis , which in principle can contribute to the asymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> = 10.0cm=10.0 cm    figure 2 shows the cp asymmetry , @xmath90 as a function of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> also , we present the integrated cp asymmetry value _ cp_int & = & + & = & 1.739 10 ^ -4 experimental observation of this decay can thus lead to a better understanding of the deeper structure of the effective hamiltonian and is also expected to shed light on the possible determination of the relative signs between various interference terms . </S>",
    "<S> the current fluxes at the b - factories are of course too small for any possible measuremnt of these numbers , but hopefully in the future such measrements will be possible . </S>"
