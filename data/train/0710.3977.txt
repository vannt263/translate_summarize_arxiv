    "the lifting problem for commuting subnormals ( lpcs ) asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of subnormal operators on hilbert space to admit commuting normal extensions .",

    "we study the subnormality of @xmath9-variable weighted shifts @xmath19 .  since a @xmath9-variable weighted shift is subnormal if and only if its weight moments are the moments of a probability measure , known as the berger - gellar - wallen measure ( or briefly berger measure ) , the search for necessary and sufficient conditions leads to the following concrete problem .",
