    "strong elliptic flow in non - central collisions is the key evidence to this understanding .",
    "hydrodynamical analysis of experimental charged particles data , also suggests that in au+au and in pb+pb collisions , a collective medium , with viscosity to entropy ratio close to the ads / cft lower bound of viscosity , @xmath1 is produced @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .    direct photons probe",
    "the _ early _ medium produced in a collision better than the charged hadrons .",
    "hadrons , being strongly interacting , are emitted from the surface of the thermalised matter and carry information about the freeze - out surface only .",
    "they are unaware of the condition of the interior of the matter and can provide information about the deep interior only in an indirect way . in a hydrodynamic model ,",
    "one fixes the initial conditions of the fluid such that the `` experimental '' freeze - out surface is correctly reproduced .",
    "in contrast to hadrons , photons , being weakly interacting , are emitted from whole volume of the matter . throughout the evolution of the matter , photons are emitted .",
    "conditions of the produced matter , at its deep interior , are better probed by the photons .",
    "depending on the transverse momentum , direct photons can probe different aspects of heavy ion collisions .",
    "a thermalised medium of quarks and gluons , or of hadrons , can produce significant number of thermal photons .",
    "they are low @xmath2 photons ( @xmath3 gev / c ) .",
    "low @xmath2 photons can test whether or not , qgp is produced in the collisions .",
    "hard photons ( @xmath4 6 gev / c ) are of pqcd origin and test the pqcd models .",
    "fast partons from jet can interact with thermal partons of qgp and produce photons . at intermediate @xmath2 range , ( @xmath5 6 gev / c ) ,",
    "interaction jets with qgp could be an important source of direct photons @xcite@xcite .",
    "recently , alice collaboration measured direct photon production in 2.76 tev pb+pb collision at lhc .",
    "@xmath2 spectra as well as elliptic flow in 0 - 40% collision was measured .",
    "inverse slope parameter of an exponential fit to the low @xmath2 part of the spectra give a temperature @xmath6 mev .",
    "previously , phenix collaboration measured direct photon @xmath2 spectra and elliptic flow in @xmath7=200 gev au+au collisions @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite . in 0 - 20% au+au collisions ,",
    "inverse slope parameter is only @xmath8 mev , considerably lower than the slope parameter at lhc energy . in ideal hydrodynamic models , photon production in au+au collisions at rhic",
    "energy has been studied extensively @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite",

    "it may be mentioned here that , though ideal hydrodynamic model explains a large part of the experimental data on charged particles , the best description to the data is obtained in dissipative hydrodynamics , with viscosity over entropy ratio close to the ads / cft conjectured value @xcite@xcite , @xmath1 .    in the following",
    ", results of our simulations for direct photons in ideal hydrodynamic model will be discussed in details . briefly , both in @xmath7=200 gev au+au collisions and in @xmath7=2.76 tev pb+pb collisions , ideal hydrodynamical model simulations for direct photons , well reproduces the experimentally measured spectra .",
    "the elliptic flow data are however , underpredicted , more in au+au collisions than in pb+pb collisions .",
    "we have also simulated hbt correlation for two photons and extracted hbt radii , as a function of centrality . even though , from rhic to lhc , collision energy increases by a factor of @xmath914 , hbt radii for direct photons do not show large energy dependence .",
    "hbt radii for direct photons also do not show large centrality dependence .",
    "in a hydrodynamical model , the invariant distribution of direct photons is obtained by convoluting the photon production rate with space - time evolution of the fluid .",
    "invariant distribution of direct photons can be obtained as ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the direct photon production rate and @xmath12 is the elementary fluid volume .",
    "several authors have studied photon emission rate hot hadronic gas @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the following we use the parametrised form given in @xcite .",

    "as it was mentioned earlier , invariant photon yield is obtained by convoluting the elementary production rates over space - time evolution . assuming that in au+au collisions at rhic or in pb+pb collisions at lhc , a baryon free qgp fluid is produced , the space - time evolution of the fluid is obtained by solving the energy - momentum conservation equation ,    @xmath20    @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eq.[eq2 ] are the energy density , pressure and fluid velocity respectively . assuming boost - invariance , eqs.[eq1 ]",

    ", in 0 - 10% - 50 - 60% collisions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for direct photons , do not show appreciable centrality dependence .",
    "the result is at variance with the centrality dependence of hbt radii for charged particles , where hbt radii decrease rapidly in peripheral collisions .",
    "outward and sideward radius @xmath50 and @xmath51 for direct photons shows marginal energy dependence . from rhic to lhc , while the collision energy is increased by a factor of @xmath914 , @xmath50 , depending on the collision centrality , increases by 30 - 50% . in central 0 - 10% and 10 - 20% collisions , @xmath51 decreases by @xmath910 - 20% as the collision energy is increased , and in peripheral 20 - 30%-50 - 60% collisions , @xmath51 is increased by @xmath930 - 40% .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 , which is considered as a measure of the emission time is increased by @xmath910 - 45% from rhic to lhc .",
    "photons are emitted for longer duration in pb+pb collisions .    in the present simulations ,",
    "dissipative effects like shear viscosity are neglected . however , from string theory motivated calculation @xcite@xcite , one understands that shear viscosity over entropy ratio has a lower bound , @xmath1 . charged",
    "particle production in au+au collisions at rhic and in pb+pb collisions at lhc is consistent with small viscous fluid evolution .",
    "viscous effect on photons production was studied in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "as it is for the charged particles , viscosity enhances @xmath2 production and decrease the elliptic flow . as it is shown here , even in ideal hydrodynamic evolution , elliptic flow for photons is less than that in experiments .",
    "agreement between experiment and simulations will further deteriorate if viscous effects are included .",
    "indeed , it is mystery that for direct photons , ideal hydrodynamic simulations produced much less elliptic flow than in experiments . evidently , further investigations are required to understand photon production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",

    "<S> direct photon production , in @xmath0=200 gev au+au and in @xmath0=2.76 tev pb+pb collisions , are studied in a hydrodynamic model . ideal hydrodynamic model , initialised to reproduce experimentally charged particle spectra in rhic and lhc energy , also reproduces the phenix and alice measurements for the direct photon spectra in au+au collisions at rhic and pb+pb collisions at lhc . the model however produces less elliptic flow than in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> discrepancy between experiment and hydrodynamic simulation is comparatively less in pb+pb collisions at lhc than in au+au collisions at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied direct photon correlation and determined the hbt radii . in 0 - 10%-50 - 60% collisions , hbt radii in au+au or in pb+pb collisions </S>",
    "<S> do not show large centrality dependence . </S>",
    "<S> energy dependence of the hbt radii for direct photons is also not large . </S>"
