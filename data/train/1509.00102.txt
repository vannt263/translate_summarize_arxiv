    "one may attempt to overcome incomplete convergence   and obtain more precise comparisons with the experimentally identified rotational bands   by application of basis extrapolation methods  @xcite .",
    "if the functional dependence ( on @xmath13 and @xmath17 ) were known , describing how the energy eigenvalues calculated in the truncated spaces approach their converged values , it should , in principle , be possible to take unconverged values obtained from calculations in truncated spaces and use them to estimate the true converged eigenvalues .",
    "such methods are still in their formative stages .",
    "nonetheless , it is intriguing to apply a straightforward scheme based on a presumed exponential convergence of energy eigenvalues with @xmath13  @xcite : @xmath183 calculations of the energy at three successive @xmath13 values , for fixed @xmath17 , are sufficient to determine all three parameters @xmath184 in  ( [ eqn - exp ] ) . extrapolating to the limit @xmath185 gives @xmath186 , so the fitted value for @xmath187 provides an estimate of the converged value for the energy .",

    "note in particular the reproduction of the excitation energies for both excited bands in @xmath5{be}$ ] ( at the @xmath25 scale ) , as well as the reproduction of the unnatural parity band rotational and coriolis parameters .",
    "this success is to be contrasted with the apparent failure to reproduce the exceptionally high experimental rotational parameter value of @xmath188 for the natural parity excited band .",
    "however , the exponential extrapolations are subject to considerable uncertainties  @xcite , and several of the experimental levels ( including in the @xmath5{be}$ ] natural parity excited band ) are subject to significant ambiguitities  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not yet clear to what extent the remaining discrepancies reflect actual deficiencies in the _ ab initio _ description of the nucleus with the chosen interactions , as opposed to these other limitations .",
    "through illustrative examples of rotational bands in _ ab initio _ ncci calculations for @xmath1{be}$ ] , we have seen how the emergence of rotational structure can be recognized through a combination of rotational energy patterns , enhanced electric quadrupole strengths , and general agreement of electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole moments and transition matrix elements with rotational predictions .",
    "it is simplest to recognize rotational states near the yrast line , where the density of states is comparatively low , as in the bands considered here .",
    "however , rotational structure may also be recognized in states further away from the yrast line ( see the excited @xmath52 band of @xmath189{be}$ ]  @xcite , as calculated and discussed in ref .  ) .",
    "it is also most straightforward to recognize rotational states with angular momenta accessible within the traditional valence space ( or ncci @xmath114 or @xmath62 space ) , since energies of band members above this angular momentum may have significantly different convergence properties and may deviate from the rotational formula , at least in the computationally - accessible truncated calculations .",
    "we have also begun to develop a sense of the robustness of the emergent rotation in _ ab initio _ calculations : at a more fundamental level , how robustly the imperfectly - known internucleon interaction can be expected to give rise to rotation , and , at a more pragmatic level , how robust the rotation is in incompletely - converged many - body calculations carried out in truncated spaces .",
    "we observe a remarkable similarity in spectral details across results obtained with two independently - derived interactions : the jisp16 interaction , obtained by inverse - scattering methods , and the chiral nnlo interaction nnlo~opt~ ( calculations with a chiral n^3^lo interaction were also considered ) .",
    "the similarity lies not only in the presence of analogous rotational bands across the calculations but in the subtle deviations of these bands from the ideal rotational formulas ( _ e.g. _ , fig .",

    "[ fig - levels-7be0 ] .",
    "the rotational patterns are also perhaps surprisingly robust against truncation of the many - body calculation .",
    "the principal challenge in identifying collective structure in ncci calculations is the weak convergence of many of the relevant observables ( fig .",
    "[ fig - conv ] ) . however , there is an important distinction between convergence of individual observables , taken singly , and convergence of relative properties , such as excitation energies ( and , especially , their ratios ) or ratios of different electromagnetic matrix elements .",
    "it is these latter , relative properties that are essential to the recognition of rotation through comparison with the rotational formula .",
    "our initial focus in examining observables lay simply in recognizing rotational patterns in the _ ab initio _ calculations and examining their fidelity to the rotational formulas .",
    "the existence of such patterns suggests a _ rotational separation _ of the wave functions , as in  ( [ eqn - psi ] ) .",
    "however , by itself , it leaves unanswered the question of the physical origin and _ intrinsic structure _ of the wave functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the nature of the intrinsic state @xmath37 .",

    "nonetheless , discontinuities in observables at the maximal valence angular momentum suggest that the spherical shell structure also plays some role .",
