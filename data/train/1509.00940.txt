    "wireless charging  @xcite , also known as wireless power transfer , is the technology that enables a power source to transmit electromagnetic energy to an electrical load across an air gap , without interconnecting cords .",
    "this technology is attracting a wide range of applications , from low - power toothbrush to high - power electric vehicles because of its convenience and better user experience . nowadays ,",
    "wireless charging is rapidly evolving from theories toward standard features on commercial products , especially mobile phones and portable smart devices . in 2014",
    ", many leading smartphone manufacturers , such as samsung , apple and huawei , began to release new - generation devices featured with built - in wireless charging capability .",
    "ims research @xcite envisioned that wireless charging would be a @xmath0 billion market by 2016 .",
    "pike research @xcite estimated that wireless powered products will triple by 2020 to a @xmath1 billion market .",
    "compared to traditional charging with cord , wireless charging introduces many benefits as follows .",
    "* firstly , it improves user - friendliness as the hassle from connecting cables is removed .",
    "different brands and different models of devices can also use the same charger .",
    "* secondly , it renders the design and fabrication of much smaller devices without the attachment of batteries . *",
    "thirdly , it provides better product durability ( e.g. , waterproof and dustproof ) for contact - free devices . *",
    "fourthly , it enhances flexibility , especially for the devices for which replacing their batteries or connecting cables for charging is costly , hazardous , or infeasible ( e.g. , body - implanted sensors ) . *",
    "fifthly , wireless charging can provide power requested by charging devices in an on - demand fashion and thus are more flexible and energy - efficient .",
    "nevertheless , normally wireless charging incurs higher implementation cost compared to wired charging .",
    "first , a wireless charger needs to be installed as a replacement of traditional charging cord .",
    "second , a mobile device requires implantation of a wireless power receiver .",
    "moreover , as wireless chargers often produce more heat than that of wired chargers , additional cost on crafting material may be incurred .",
    "the development of wireless charging technologies is advancing toward two major directions , i.e. , radiative wireless charging ( or radio frequency ( rf ) based wireless charging ) and non - radiative wireless charging ( or coupling - based wireless charging ) .",
    "radiative wireless charging adopts electromagnetic waves , typically rf waves or microwaves , as a medium to deliver energy in a form of radiation .",
    "the energy is transferred based on the electric field of an electromagnetic wave , which is radiative . due to the safety issues raised by rf exposure  @xcite",
    ", radiative wireless charging usually operates in a low power region .",
    "for example , omni - directional rf radiation is only suitable for sensor node applications with up to 10mw power consumption @xcite .",
    "alternatively , non - radiative wireless charging is based on the coupling of the magnetic - field between two coils within the distance of the coils dimension for energy transmission . as the magnetic - field of an electromagnetic wave attenuates much faster than the electric field , the power transfer distance is largely limited . due to safety implementation",
    ", non - radiative wireless charging has been widely used in our daily appliances ( e.g. , from toothbrush to electric vehicle charger @xcite ) by far .    in this article",
    ", we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging wireless charging systems with regard to the fundamental technologies , international standards as well as applications in wireless communication networks .",
    "our previous work in  @xcite presented a review of research issues in rf - powered wireless networks with the focus on the receiver - side ( i.e. , energy harvester ) designs .",
    "this survey differs from  @xcite in the following aspects : this survey i ) covers various major wireless charging techniques , namely , inductive coupling , magnetic resonance coupling and rf / microwave radiation , from fundamental principles to their applications , ii ) reviews the existing international standards , commercialization and implementations , and iii ) emphasizes on the transmitter - side ( i.e. , wireless charger ) strategy designs for different types of network applications .",
    "another recent survey in  @xcite provides an overview of self - sustaining wireless communications with different energy harvesting techniques , from the perspective of information theory , signal processing and wireless networking .",
    "unlike  @xcite , this survey focuses on the wireless charging strategies in communication networks with wireless energy harvesting capability , also referred to as wireless powered communication networks ( wpcns )  @xcite .",
    ".summary of existing survey in related area . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      table  [ deployment_strategies ] summarizes the existing wireless charger deployment strategies . clearly , multi - hop provisioning has been less investigated , only in  @xcite . additionally , it is important to study a system when each device can harvest energy from multiple transmitters . as for the deployment scenarios ,",
    "none of the existing works considers the deployment of mobile chargers in mobile networks .",
    "mobile charger deployment strategies based on the mobility pattern of user devices can be studied .    moreover , we observe that the deployment problems are formulated mostly as optimization problems with different objectives and constraints .",
    "all the solutions consequently need global information such as devices battery capacity , location , and even hardware specification parameters and velocity ( e.g. , in  @xcite ) .",
    "collecting these information incurs tremendous communication overhead . though some of the proposed solutions ( e.g. , in  @xcite and  @xcite ) claimed to be of low - complexity and scalable for large networks , its feasibility and practicability in deploying them in real systems have to be evaluated",
    "alternatively , decentralized approaches based on local information that relax the communication requirement can be one of the important future directions .",
    "moreover , most of the proposals were evaluated by numerical simulation .",
    "only references  @xcite and  @xcite have provided system - level simulation .",
    "there is the need for future research to conduct more assessment through system - level simulations and real experiments to understand the empirical performance .",
    "in this section , we first summarize some open issues with regard to both wireless charging technologies and data communication in wireless charging systems .",
    "then , we envision several novel paradigms emerging with the advance of wireless charging technologies .",
    "this subsection first discusses some technical issues in wireless charging , then highlights some communication challenges .      _",
    "inductive coupling : _ the increase of wireless charging power density gives rise to several technical issues , e.g. , thermal , electromagnetic compatibility , and electromagnetic field problems  @xcite .",
    "this requires high - efficiency power conversion techniques to reduce the power loss at an energy receiver and battery modules with effective ventilation design .",
    "_ magnetic resonance coupling : _ magnetic resonance coupling - based techniques , such as witritiy and magmimo , have a larger charging area and are capable of charging multiple devices simultaneously . however , they also cause increased electromagnetic interference with a lower efficiency compared with inductive charging .",
    "another limitation with magnetic resonance coupling is the relatively large size of a transmitter . the wireless charging distance is generally proportional to the diameter of the transmitter .",
    "therefore , wireless charging over long distance typically requires a large receiver size .",
    "_ near - field beamforming : _ for multi - antenna near - field beamforming , the computation of a magnetic - beamforming vector on the transmission side largely depends on the knowledge of the magnetic channels to the receivers .",
    "the design of channel estimation and feedback mechanisms is of paramount importance . with the inaccuracy of channel estimation or absence of feedback , the charging performance severely deteriorates .",
    "additionally , there exists a hardware limitation that the impedance matching is optimally operated only within a certain range  @xcite .",
    "_ localization for rf - based energy beamforming : _ as aforementioned , energy beamforming is able to enhance the power transfer efficiency .",
    "however , the energy transmitter needs to know the location of the energy receiver to steer the energy beam to .",
    "localization needs to make real - time spatial estimations for two major parameters , i.e. , angle and distance .",
    "self - detection and localization of to - be - charger devices is challenging especially for mobile wpcns .",
    "additionally , similar to near - field beamforming , channel estimation is also very critical in the design of beamforming vectors .",
    "_ heating effect : _ a metallic or ferromagnetic material can absorb some of the near - field energy if it locates in a proximity of any wireless charger . the induced voltage / current on the material can cause temperature rise . as metallic material is an essential part of electronic devices , the resultant temperature rise lowers charging efficiency and can render bad user experience . although both qi and a4wp have the mechanisms to avoid safety issues such as severe over - temperature , system power loss is still inevitable and can be considerable especially if the device is large in size .",
    "moreover , foreign objects may be another factor to cause power loss .",
    "how to mitigate the heating effect to diminish power loss is challenging .",
    "_ energy conversion efficiency : _ wireless charging requires electricity energy to be transformed from ac to electronmagnetic waves and then to dc .",
    "each conversion adds the loss in overall energy , which leads to a normally wireless charging efficiency hovering between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "efforts toward hardware improvement of energy conversion efficiency are instrumental to achieve highly efficient wireless charging .      to improve the usability and efficiency of the wireless charger , their data communication capability can be enhanced",
    ".    _ duplex communication and multiple access : _ the current communication protocols support simplex communication ( e.g. , from a charging device to charger ) . however , there are some important procedures which require duplex communication . for example , the charging device can request for a certain charging power , while the charger may request for battery status of the charging device",
    ". moreover , the current protocols support one - to - one communication . however ,",
    "multiple device charging can be implemented with multiple access for data transmission among charging devices and a charger has to be developed and implemented .    _",
    "secure communication : _ the current protocols support plain communication between a charger and a charging device .",
    "they are susceptible to jamming attacks @xcite ( e.g. , to block the communication between the charger and the charging device ) , eavesdropping attacks ( e.g. , to steal charging device s and charger s identity ) and man - in - the - middle attacks ( e.g. , malicious device manipulates or falsifies charging status ) .",
    "the security features have to be developed in the communication protocols , taking unique wireless charging characteristics ( e.g. , in - band communication in qi ) into account .    _",
    "inter - charger communication : _ the protocols support only the communication between a charger and charging device ( i.e. , intra - charger ) .",
    "multiple chargers can be connected and their information as well as charging devices information can be exchanged ( i.e. , inter - charger ) . although the concept of wireless charger networking has been proposed in  @xcite , there are some possible improvements .",
    "for example , wireless chargers can be integrated with a wireless access point , which is called a hybrid access point , to provide both data communication and energy transfer services .      in this subsection , we discuss several emerging paradigms which are anticipated in wireless powered communication networks .",
    "similar to wireless communication networks that provide data service , a wireless charger network can be built to deliver energy provisioning service to distributed users . the wireless charger network that connects a collection of distributed chargers through wired or wireless links allows to exchange information ( e.g. , include availability , location , charging status , and cost of different chargers ) to schedule the chargers .",
    "such scheduling can either be made in a distributed or centralized manner to optimize certain objectives ( e.g. , system energy efficiency , total charging cost ) .",
    "a wireless charger network can be a hybrid system based on several charging techniques to satisfy heterogeneous charging and coverage requirement .",
    "for instance , the system may utilize short - range near - field chargers ( e.g. , inductive - based ) to charge static devices that have high power demand , mid - range near - field chargers ( e.g. , resonance - based ) to charge devices having no line - of - sight charging link and relax the coil alignment requirement .",
    "furthermore , a far - field charger ( e.g. powercaster and cota system ) can be employed to cover remote devices with low - power requirement and some local movement requirement , ( e.g. , wearable devices , mp3 , watches , google glasses , and sensors in smart building ) .      with the increasing deployment of wireless powered devices , how to provision wireless energy for large - scale networks in an eco - friendly way",
    "becomes an emerging issue . as reviewed above ,",
    "both static and mobile charger scheduling strategies have been developed for power replenishment .",
    "however , these strategies could incur more pollution and energy consumption , if the power sources and charging techniques for wireless chargers are not appropriately adopted .",
    "for example , the vehicle equipped with wireless chargers for mobile energy provisioning will produce considerable amount of co@xmath4 emission .",
    "moreover , due to the propagation loss and thus low transfer efficiency , a static rf - based charger powered by the electric grid could cause more consumption of conventional fuels , like coal , to harm the environment .",
    "currently , how to perform green wireless energy provisioning remains an open issue and has been ignored by the majority of existing studies .",
    "one promising solution is to equip renewable energy sources , e.g. , solar , for wireless chargers .",
    "however , renewable energy could be unpredictable , thus hard for the chargers to deliver reliable wireless charging services .",
    "significant relevant issues can be explored in this direction .",
    "full - duplex based wireless information transmitter  @xcite can be equipped with multiple antennas to transmit information and receive energy simultaneously in the same frequency band .",
    "conventionally , a full - duplex system suffers from the self - interference as part of the transmitted rf signals is received by the transmitter itself .",
    "self - interference is undesirable because it degrades the desired information signal .",
    "however , with the capability of harvesting rf energy , self - interference can facilitate energy saving .",
    "in particular , part of the energy used for information transmission can be captured by the receive antenna(s ) for future reuse , referred to as self - energy recycling . this paradigm benefits both energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency . moreover , it can be widely applied to a multi - antenna base station , access point , relay node , and user devices .",
    "millimeter - wave cellular communications  @xcite that operates on frequency ranging from 30 to 300ghz have become a new frontier for next - generation wireless systems .",
    "due to high frequencies , millimeter - wave cellular communication is a natural system to facilitate wireless energy beamforming . for a multi - antenna transmitter , the beamforming efficiency increases by increasing the frequency .",
    "moreover , frequency is a key factor that affects the physical size of a rectenna based microwave power conversion system  @xcite . at high frequency ranges ,",
    "the required size of the antennas is small , which consequently renders a small form factor for the system .",
    "moreover , a small form factor helps to advance beamforming by enabling a larger number of antennas to be placed in an array , which further helps to mitigate charging power attenuation .",
    "thus , a millimeter - wave rf transmitter is desired to be utilized for rf - based wireless charging and swipt .",
    "as afore - introduced , swipt ( see  @xcite and references therein ) has been broadly investigated in rf - based wireless communication systems . with the emerging of coupling - based chargers , magnetic induction communication @xcite can also be incorporated in near - field charging system to induce swipt .",
    "near - field communication based on magnetic field can achieve significant capacity gain compared with rf - based communication .",
    "a hardware design and implementation were reported in @xcite that an inductive coupling based chip can deliver 11gbps for a distance of 15@xmath5 m in 180 nm complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) .",
    "therefore , swipt - compliant near - field chargers have great potentials in high - speed data offloading in next generation communications . being backhauled with high - speed internet connections , swipt - compliant near - field chargers can be integrated into cellular systems for seamless data service during charging .",
    "wireless power technology offers the possibility of removing the last remaining cord connections required to replenish portable electronic devices .",
    "this promising technology has significantly advanced during the past decades and introduces a large amount of user - friendly applications . in this article , we have presented a comprehensive survey on the paradigm of wireless charging compliant communication networks .",
    "starting from the development history , we have further introduced the fundamental , international standards and network applications of wireless charging in a sequence , followed by the discussion of open issues and envision of future applications .",
    "the integration of wireless charging with existing communication networks creates new opportunities as well as challenges for resource allocation .",
    "this survey has shown the existing solutions of providing seamless wireless power transfer through static charger scheduling , mobile charger dispatch and wireless charger deployment . among those studies , various emerging issues including online mobile charger dispatch strategies , near - field energy beamforming schemes ,",
    "energy provisioning for mobile networks , distributed wireless charger deployment strategies , and multiple access control for wireless power communication networks are less explored and require further investigation .",
    "additionally , the open issues and practical challenges discussed in section viii can be considered as main directions for future research .",
