    "a powerful constraint on these processes is provided by an independent age estimate . in cases where both a pulsar and its associated supernova remnant ( snr ) can be identified ,",
    "an age estimate which is independent of both distance and inclination effects is simply @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the angular separation between the pulsar and its inferred birth site , and @xmath7 is the pulsar s proper motion @xcite .",
    "this can then be compared to the age of the system as expected from spin - down ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath8 , \\label{eqn_age}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the current spin period , @xmath10 is the time - derivative of @xmath9 , @xmath11 is the period at birth , and @xmath12 is the `` braking index '' ( see further discussion in  [ sec_old ] ) .",
    "comparison of these two independent age estimates provides information on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , i.e. , on the processes which impart and then dissipate the considerable angular momentum of neutron stars ( e.g. , gaensler & frail 2000 , hereafter gf00 ; kaspi  2001b ) . if one assumes that @xmath13 and @xmath14 , equation  ( [ eqn_age ] ) reduces to the expression for the `` characteristic age '' of a pulsar , @xmath15 .",
    "psr  is an isolated 125-ms pulsar , surrounded by the cometary radio and x - ray pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , which in turn is located just outside the snr  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_snr ] , the combined system has a distinctive morphology which has led to it being termed `` the duck '' .",
    "because of the proximity of the pulsar to the snr , and because the pwn morphology suggests that the pulsar is moving away from the snr interior , it has been widely assumed that the pulsar and the snr are physically associated .",
    "the snr and pwn also have very similar hi  absorption spectra , both suggesting a distance of @xmath16  kpc @xcite , and consistent with the distance of 5.1  kpc implied by the pulsar s dispersion measure and the galactic electron density model of @xcite .",
    "we consequently adopt a common distance of 5  kpc for pulsar , pwn and snr in further discussion .",
    "psr  has a characteristic age @xmath17  kyr @xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath18 and that the pulsar has traveled @xmath19 from the snr s center in its lifetime @xcite , reflects the uncertainty in locating the pulsar s presumed birthplace .",
    "this results from the fact that the pulsar s inferred trajectory does not pass through the snr s geometric center ( fig .",

    "see  [ sec_old ] for further discussion .",
    "] this implies a westward proper motion for the pulsar of magnitude @xmath20  mas  yr@xmath2 . however , radio interferometric observations of the western tip of the pwn taken at the very large array ( vla ) over 6.7  years yielded a surprising 5-@xmath3 upper limit @xmath21  mas  yr@xmath2 ( gf00 ) , implying a pulsar age @xmath22  kyr  @xmath23 , if the pulsar was born near the snr s geometric center .",
    "gf00 used the stand - off distance of the pwn , the radius of the snr and the separation of the pulsar from the snr s center to derive a solution for the system s evolution which predicted @xmath24  kyr and @xmath25  mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "subsequently , thorsett  ( 2002 , hereafter tbg02 ) observed the pulsar itself with the vla over a 3.9-year baseline , and placed an independent upper limit on westward proper motion  mas  yr@xmath2 at 95% confidence ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) .",
    "here we use 5-@xmath3 limits throughout , and have adjusted their limit accordingly . ] of @xmath27  mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "tbg02 argue that this is most easily explained if psr  and snr  are unrelated , and if the pulsar is instead moving away from the center of the pwn  .",
    "assuming @xmath28 , one can then predict a proper motion @xmath29  mas  yr@xmath2 . as a further alternative ,",
    "@xcite has argued that this system results from a massive high - velocity progenitor star which went supernova inside its wind - blown bubble .",
    "the pulsar began its life substantially offset from the cavity s center , but the resulting snr expands to take on the shape of the cavity .",
    "@xcite subsequently develops a model in which @xmath30  kyr , @xmath31 and @xmath32  mas  yr@xmath2 .    as an attempt to resolve this puzzling situation ,",
    "we have conducted a new observation of the western cometary tip of pwn  ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ fig_snr ] ) , which doubles the time baseline considered by gf00 to 12 years . in  [ sec_obs ] we present our new observations and corresponding measurement of proper motion , while in  [ sec_disc ] we we interpret these new results in the context of various possibilities proposed for the origin and evolution of this system .",
    "we have utilized three separate observations of , all carried out near 8.5  ghz with the vla in its hybrid bna configuration .",
    "the first two epochs were on 1993  feb  02 and 1999  oct  23 , as discussed by gf00 ; the third epoch was on 2005  jan  22 , with an on - source integration time of 2.9  hr , and parameters otherwise the same as for the 1999 epoch reported by gf00 .",
    "in particular , observations of  at all three epochs were phase - referenced to the source pmn  j17512524 , located @xmath33 from  ( and for consistency using the same position for pmn  j17512524 at each epoch , even though the best estimate of the position of this source has been updated by a small amount in recent years ) .",
    "analysis was carried out in the miriad package @xcite .",
    "data from the three epochs were reduced in almost identical fashion , making allowances for the slightly different correlator mode used in the 1993 data .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated , and imaged using square pixels of size 50  mas @xmath34 50  mas .",
    "the fields were then deconvolved using clean and smoothed to a common resolution of @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting images , shown in figure  [ fig_pwn ] , suggest that there have been slight structural changes between epochs .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in figure  [ fig_pwn ] demonstrate that motion at the 5-@xmath3 limit of gf00 could now have been easily discerned , and that any change in the position of the leading edge of the pwn is well below this level .",
    "we have quantified this result by measuring the shift between epochs using the miriad task imdiff .",
    "imdiff finds the shift that minimizes the rms of intensity fluctuations in the resulting difference map , employing cubic convolution interpolation to calculate shifts of a non - integer pixel number @xcite .    using the approach described by gf00 , the shift that we determine between the 1993 and 2005 epochs is @xmath36  mas in a westward direction .",
    "however , this does not take into account any systematic errors present in this shift determination , nor does it use the combination of all three epochs .",
    "we have thus determined the motion of the pwn by measuring the shift between all three possible pairs of epochs using imdiff . to characterize the statistical error in the reported shifts , for each pair a series of phase shifts",
    "were applied to the @xmath37 visibility of one epoch , resulting in images which had been shifted east or west by 0 , 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.2 , @xmath38 , 4.0  pixels .",
    "this allowed us to probe the systematic errors introduced by imdiff for non - integer pixel shifts of a faint extended source in the presence of noise . to minimize the effects of any internal structural change in the pwn between epochs , the brightness distribution above a surface brightness of 70  mjy  beam@xmath2 was pegged at 70  mjy  beam@xmath2 , giving the nebula a largely uniform intensity out to its periphery . for each pair of epochs and each phase shift , imdiff",
    "was then run using 16 different sets of inputs , produced by alternating between four different spatial windows , by switching between the choice of epoch used as the reference image , and constraining imdiff to find a shift only in r.a . , or in both r.a .  and decl",
    "the ensemble of outputs from the combinations of these options allowed us to characterize , for each input trial shift , a mean fitted shift in the r.a .",
    "direction and its systematic error .",
    "the recovered shifts were then plotted against the input shifts and fit with a weighted linear least - squares model .",
    "the ordinate intercept then represented the best - fit measured motion between each pair of epochs . the statistical error on this estimate",
    "was determined by calculating the standard error in the mean amongst the residuals between input and mean output values for the 21 trial shifts for each pair .",
    "the statistical and mean systematic errors were then combined in quadrature to give the final error estimate for each pair .",
    "other sources of error , such as phase transferral and calibration error , are negligible compared to these effects and have not been incorporated in this analysis .",
    "we then examined the correlation between shifts between each of the three epoch pairs and the time separation between these pairs .",
    "if steady westward motion was detected , we would have expected these two quantities to correlate , but the data show no such trend .",
    "we conclude that despite our best efforts to minimize the effects of structural changes in the nebula between epochs , the underlying proper motion is too small in magnitude to be seen in the presence of the systematic errors introduced by these changes . we have correspondingly determined an upper limit on the source s motion by calculating the @xmath39 of the best linear fit to the data , and then finding the larger of the two slopes for which @xmath39 increases by 5-@xmath3 over this best - fit value .    through this approach",
    ", we find an upper limit on westward proper motion of  of @xmath40  mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "this and previous estimates are shown in table  [ tab_results ] : it can be seen that this new result is nearly a factor of two more constraining than existing measurements . for @xmath41 as assumed above , the 5-@xmath3 lower limit on the system s age is @xmath42  kyr ( see table  [ tab_results ] ) .    note",
    "that because the x - ray and radio morphologies of  suggest proper motion purely in a westward direction , we have not included any shift in decl .  in our final proper motion estimates . in any case , the derived shift between each pair of epochs is consistent with zero proper motion in decl .    assuming a distance to the system of 5  kpc",
    ", we can infer an upper limit on the projected westward velocity for psr  of 340  .",
    "this limit is consistent with the observed range of motions for other pulsars associated with snrs ( see table 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also with the overall projected velocity distribution of the young pulsar population @xcite .",
    "since we have used the motion of pwn  as a proxy for that of psr  , the two objects must move together rigidly for our limit to be applicable to the pulsar . as discussed by gf00",
    ", the pulsar could be moving faster than our upper limit if the stand - off distance between the pulsar and the head of the bow shock were steadily decreasing with time , as might be produced by the system encountering a sudden increase in density .",
    "however , this is unlikely to be the case since , if anything , the data in figure  [ fig_pwn ] suggest that emission from the leading edge of the bow shock has slightly faded in brightness as a function of time .",
    "if this is navely interpreted as corresponding to a reduction in ambient density , then the stand - off distance could even be increasing with time , further strengthening our upper limit on the pulsar s motion . in any case the direct observations of the pulsar reported by tbg02 rule out a large disparity between the proper motions of the pulsar and its pwn .",
    "the angular proximity and consistent distance estimates for psr  and snr  obviously demand that the possibility of a physical association be considered .",
    "further evidence strengthening the case for a genuine association are the high spin - down luminosity of the pulsar , the fact that the pwn s cometary tail points back toward the snr s interior ( seen in figs .  [ fig_snr ] and  [ fig_pwn ] ) , and the edge - brightening and flatter spectral index of snr  along its western rim near the pulsar ( fig .",
    "[ fig_snr ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the absence of any constraints on the pwn s proper motion or the pulsar s age",
    ", the simplest interpretation would seem to be that the pulsar was born reasonably close to the snr s geometric center , has then moved outward , overtaken the snr , and in the process has re - energized the shell s emission with its relativistic outflow of particles and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , in  [ sec_obs ] we have derived @xmath43  kyr if the pulsar was born near the snr s center . since @xmath44  kyr  @xmath45",
    ", the picture proposed above is problematic .    in the following discussion ,",
    "we consider three possible solutions to this difficulty : ( 1 ) the pulsar and the snr are physically associated with an age @xmath28 , but the pulsar was born substantially offset from the snr s geometric center ; ( 2 ) the pulsar and snr are physically associated , but @xmath46 ; or ( 3 ) the two objects have no physical association .",
    "we conclude by considering the nature of , which we argue provides additional clues to distinguish between these possibilities .      in the case of a physical association , but with a supernova explosion substantially offset from the geometric center of the snr , our upper limit on @xmath47 can potentially be made consistent with the characteristic age .",
    "if the blast center of the snr were considerably closer to the current location of the pulsar than the separation of @xmath41 assumed earlier , the predicted pulsar motion would be lower , and possibly could brought below the upper limit in table  [ tab_results ] .    a reasonable mechanism through which this large offset could have occurred",
    "is if the supernova occurred in the stellar wind bubble of a moving progenitor star @xcite .",
    "expansion of a snr into such a bubble could produce a remnant whose blast site is substantially separated from the geometric center @xcite . in such a case , the pulsar could have been born inside the snr but quite close to its present location , and the predicted proper motion would then be very low .",
    "this explanation was viable for the upper limits obtained by gf00 and tbg02 .",
    "however , for our new , more constraining proper motion measurement , the pulsar would need to have been born on the rim of or even outside the snr to satisfy the requirement that @xmath28 .",
    "while it is possible that the progenitor star was in the process of escaping its own wind bubble when the supernova occurred , such a system would produce an snr significantly elongated and distorted along the east - west axis corresponding to the pulsar s motion @xcite , not consistent with the snr morphology seen here .",
    "furthermore , since the pulsar was kicked randomly away from its birthplace , a wide separation between the neutron star birth site and the snr s geometric center implies that there should most likely be a significant misalignment between the pulsar s direction of motion ( as inferred from the pwn s morphology ) and the vector joining the snr s center to the pulsar s current position @xcite .",
    "specifically , for an explosion occurring near the edge of the cavity , there is a @xmath48 probability that the misalignment between the projections of these two vectors will be larger than the @xmath49 observed .",
    "the mild misalignment between the projections of these two vectors therefore makes a scenario in which the explosion was substantially off - center relatively unlikely .      as suggested by gf00 and @xcite , the case for a pulsar / snr association",
    "can be made if the characteristic age is a significant underestimate of the system s true age .",
    "the solution proposed by gf00 predicts an evolved system consisting of an old snr and a slow - moving pulsar , for which @xmath50  kyr and @xmath51  mas  yr@xmath2 , consistent with the upper limits found here .",
    "however , we then need to explain why @xmath46 .",
    "to consider this possibility , we must reconsider the assumptions underlying equation  ( [ eqn_age ] ) .",
    "the braking index , @xmath12 , is defined by the equation @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . for spin - down via a magnetic dipole _ in vacuo _ , we expect @xmath14 .",
    "following @xcite , we separately define the `` deceleration parameter '' , @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath55 and @xmath12 are both constant , then @xmath56 .",
    "there are two situations in which the characteristic age , @xmath57 , can underestimate the true age as required here .",
    "the first possibility is that @xmath58 and @xmath55 is constant , but @xmath59 . for psr  ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn_age ] ) can only yield @xmath60  kyr for @xmath61  ms , and even then only for @xmath62 .",
    "in contrast , measurements of initial spin in most other systems suggest @xmath63  ms @xcite , while in the few cases where @xmath64 has been determined , it is found that @xmath65 ( livingstone  2005 , 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "it thus seems unlikely that a viable set of parameters can describe the system via equation  ( [ eqn_age ] ) .",
    "the alternative is that @xmath55 is not constant . in this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn_age ] ) no longer holds , and @xmath66 ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". either a changing magnetic field or a changing moment of inertia can cause @xmath55 to vary with time ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the pulsar spin - down is uncoupled from the star s age , and rather traces the time scale on which @xmath55 evolves .",
    "while it seems unlikely that the star s moment of inertia could evolve substantially on this time - scale , the growth of the surface magnetic field is a possibility , as may result from thermoelectric instabilities in the crust or diffusion of magnetic flux from the star s interior @xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath14 but @xmath67 , then @xmath68 underestimates the true age , and the surface magnetic field , @xmath69 , grows with time @xcite .",
    "indeed @xmath67 is observed for all six pulsars in which this quantity has been accurately determined , while @xmath70 is suggested in long - term timing signatures of several other pulsars @xcite . while @xmath64 has not been directly measured for psr  , we can write as an order of magnitude estimate that the time scale for field growth has been @xmath71  kyr .    we further note that this does not require us to invoke a unique effect to explain this specific pulsar / snr association . even though @xmath72 for many other pulsars in snrs , these results are still consistent with @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "gradual magnetic field growth may thus be widespread , but is only noticeable in a system such as the duck for which its comparatively large age has allowed this effect to accumulate .",
    "it is important to acknowledge that the large implied age ( @xmath60  kyr ) is beyond what is expected for the observable lifetime of a snr , which is typically @xmath73  kyr @xcite .",
    "thus even if magnetic field growth can explain the discrepancy between the pulsar s characteristic age and that inferred from proper motion , the large implied age is also a potential issue for snr  .",
    "however , the faint eastern rim of the snr is consistent with what is seen for older , undisturbed shells , and may not have been easily identified on its own if not for the brighter western side .",
    "thus the large age required for the snr is not inconsistent with the appearance of this half of the snr .",
    "furthermore , if the pulsar and snr are physically associated , the discrepancy between the system s inferred age and the expected lifetime for observable snrs can be resolved by the argument that the pulsar is re - energizing the snr as it passes through it @xcite .",
    "the re - energization hypothesis predicts that brighter emission with a flatter spectrum should be seen along the western edge of snr , and that these effects should peak where the pulsar would have crossed the rim .",
    "indeed these phenomena are both observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig_snr ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a requirement of this theory is that synchrotron - emitting particles must diffuse sufficiently rapidly away from the pulsar around the rim of the shell to produce the observed region of apparent interaction @xcite .",
    "we can quantify this as follows .",
    "if @xmath74 is the time elapsed since the pulsar first began to interact with the snr shell and @xmath75 is the distance which is traveled by particles along the shell s circumference after injection by the pulsar wind , then we require @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the diffusion coefficient of synchrotron emitting particles as they move from the pulsar around the rim . from figure  [ fig_snr ]",
    "we estimate @xmath78  pc and @xmath79  kyr .",
    "we thus require @xmath80  @xmath81  s@xmath2 to explain the snr s appearance .",
    "we can determine if this inferred diffusion coefficient is reasonable by considering the magnetic field configuration through which particles must propagate .",
    "if the snr is in the radiative phase as argued by gf00 , then we expect strong compression at the snr shock , and hence a magnetic field which runs parallel to the shell .",
    "indeed radio polarization measurements clearly demonstrate this geometry to be present along the snr s western rim @xcite .",
    "the mean free path in directions parallel to the magnetic field lines is larger than the electron gyroradius by a factor @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the ambient magnetic field strength in the snr shell and @xmath84 is the amplitude of turbulent fluctuations in @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we can thus write @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the standard bohm diffusion coefficient , with value @xmath87  @xmath81  s@xmath2 for the 327-mhz image shown in figure  [ fig_snr ] @xcite .",
    "we then require @xmath88 . in comparison ,",
    "@xcite find @xmath89 for young snrs which have enhanced turbulence , but @xmath90 for the ism . if we assume a field strength @xmath91  @xmath7 g , we thus find @xmath92 , consistent with snr  being an old remnant with reduced turbulent amplitude which is merging into the ism ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the re - energization hypothesis is consistent with the expected rapid diffusion of particles from the pulsar around the shell rim .    as a final note ,",
    "we point out that even if the pulsar is old , a small offset between the supernova explosion site and the snr s geometric center is still required .",
    "specifically , the trajectory of the pulsar as inferred from the cometary tail of the pwn passes north of the snr s geometric center , indicating that the blast and geometric centers do not coincide ( fig.[fig_snr ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed that a gradient in the density of the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) into which the snr is expanding could produce an asymmetric expansion , indeed resulting in a small offset between the explosion site and the snr s center .",
    "alternatively , @xcite has proposed that the misalignment between the pulsar s expected and inferred trajectories could be due to a progenitor star which explodes slightly offset from the center of its wind - blown bubble ( as already discussed in  [ sec_offc ] , but for the case of a young pulsar with a subtantial offset from the bubble s center ) .",
    "this again leads to the conclusion that the pulsar s true age is considerably in excess of its characteristic age ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the alternative simple explanation proposed by tbg02 is that snr  and psr  have no physical connection . given the relatively high density on the sky of both pulsars and snrs in the inner galactic plane , it is reasonable that two such objects could appear near each other in projection @xcite .",
    "hi  absorption is only able to provide lower limits on the distances to the snr and pwn @xcite , while the pulsar s distance estimate as derived from its dispersion measure is model dependent and comes with significant associated uncertainties ( see discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "thus , although the distances to the two objects are consistent , tbg02 point out that this is not necessarily strong evidence in favor of an association .",
    "previous discussions had focused on the flatter spectrum and brighter emission of the snr as evidence for an association , as described above . however , tbg02 point out that variations in spectral index and asymmetries in brightness are both common in snrs .",
    "in particular , many snrs are brighter on the side closest to the galactic plane , as observed here . while these are valid arguments",
    ", we note that in most other snrs in which spectral index variations are observed , these changes are spread randomly over the snr , rather than concentrated in a particular region @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the systematic trend toward flatter spectra as one gets closer to the pulsar position around the rim of  is difficult to explain if the snr and pulsar are unassociated .",
    "an important additional aspect of this discussion is the nature of . as tbg02 note ,",
    "the very tight angular coincidence of psr  and , along with the cometary morphology of the latter , make it virtually certain that at least these two objects are associated .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that figure  [ fig_pwn ] shows only the westernmost extent of this source .",
    "the inset to figure  [ fig_snr ] demonstrates that eastward of the pulsar , this structure broadens into a larger nebula , approximately @xmath93 in extent .",
    "tbg02 interpret this overall morphology as a `` crab - like '' pwn . in their model ,",
    "the pulsar was born at the center of this larger nebula , and is now moving away from this site . however , there are difficulties with this interpretation . for the pulsar to have escaped from its own wind - driven bubble ,",
    "the expansion speed of the pwn must have fallen well below the pulsar s space velocity .",
    "this process can only occur in two scenarios .",
    "the first possibility is that as a pwn expands into the freely expanding ejecta of its associated snr , it will eventually collide with the snr reverse shock @xcite .",
    "the resulting interaction can reduce and even reverse the expansion of the pwn .",
    "combined with the pulsar s ballistic motion , this compression of the pwn produces a morphology in which the pulsar is at the tip of a trail of radio / x - ray emission , connected to a larger `` relic pwn '' .",
    "this scenario was invoked by @xcite to explain the morphologies of the pwne seen in snrs n157b and g327.71.1 .",
    "the difficulty with this interpretation here is that to have produced a reverse shock , the snr needs to have interacted with and swept up a significant amount of interstellar gas .",
    "the fact that we do not see any radio emission from an associated snr makes this interpretation problematic .",
    "the alternative possibility is that no significant outer blast wave was produced , as may be the case for the crab nebula and for 3c  58 @xcite .",
    "the pwn then interacts directly with the ism , and has decelerated sufficiently as it sweeps up ambient gas that the pulsar is now able to overtake it . in this case we can write @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the radius of the `` relic '' component of the nebula at time @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the ambient mass density , and where we have assumed that the pulsar blows a steady wind of luminosity @xmath98 into a uniform surrounding medium . for @xmath99  kyr , @xmath100  ergs  s@xmath2 and @xmath101  pc , we then find an ambient number density @xmath102  @xmath103 .",
    "this high value can be ruled out by the morphology of the bow - shock component of the pwn . as discussed by gf00 ,",
    "the stand - off distance between the pulsar position and the apex of the bow shock is @xmath104  pc .",
    "this position is set by pressure balance between the pulsar wind and the ram pressure of the surroundings , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the pulsar space velocity .",
    "the left hand term yields a pressure @xmath107  ergs  @xmath103 . for the density inferred above ,",
    "we then find @xmath108  .",
    "not only is this velocity more than an order of magnitude slower than seen for young pulsars , but the solution is not self - consistent , since in 15  kyr , such a pulsar would only have traveled @xmath109  pc and so could not have moved outside its pwn bubble .",
    "we thus conclude that there is no obvious explanation for  if psr  is @xmath110  kyr old and is unassociated with snr  .",
    "on the other hand , if there is a genuine association between the pulsar and the snr , then  could represent the remnants of the interaction between the pulsar wind and the snr shell .",
    "@xcite consider the interaction between a high - velocity pulsar and a snr in the sedov - taylor phase of evolution .",
    "they show that as the pulsar crosses the snr , the drop in ram pressure from that in the snr shell to that of the ambient ism results in an expansion of the bow - shock structure . however , if is in the pressure - driven `` snowplow '' phase of evolution ( as argued by gf00 and as would be typical for the age inferred in table  [ tab_results ] ) , then the compression ratio of gas swept up by the forward shock will be much larger than the standard factor of four seen in the sedov solution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , during the period in which the pulsar breaks through the rim of the shell , the ram pressure experienced by the bow shock drops dramatically , which in turn should produce a sudden , explosive expansion of the pulsar wind nebula .",
    "as the pulsar moves outward , the pulsar wind blows a `` crab - like '' structure into the ism , which might possibly correspond to .",
    "eventually the pulsar readjusts to its new , lower density environment , again forming a standard mach cone , but connected to the larger relic structure left behind .",
    "this idea needs testing by full hydrodynamic modeling , but it provides a feasible explanation for the overall morphology of in the scenario in which the pulsar is old and is associated with the snr .",
    "we note that @xcite has proposed an alternate explanation for , in which this source is a slowly expanding lobe produced by the collimated flow of hot gas which follows the pulsar as it punctures the snr shell .",
    "this similarly requires a physical association between the pulsar and the snr .",
    "the upper limit on proper motion we find for the pwn  is the most restrictive one obtained to date for this system .",
    "we are able to reject the original expectation that psr  was born @xmath110  kyr ago and is associated with snr  , regardless of whether the corresponding supernova occurred at the geometric center of the snr , or at a site substantially offset from this .",
    "two possibilities remain .",
    "first , the pulsar and snr are associated and share an age @xmath111  kyr . in this case",
    ", the pulsar has a typical projected space velocity of @xmath112  , which allows it to overtake its snr at this stage and drive a bow shock through ambient gas . the sudden drop in pressure",
    "as the pulsar crosses the snr s radiative shell might also explain the bulbous component of the pwn  seen between the pulsar and the snr .",
    "the pulsar s passage has re - energized the radio emission from the snr through rapid diffusion of pulsar wind particles along magnetic field lines ; without this new injection of particles , the snr would be much dimmer , would have a steeper spectrum and generally would be more difficult to detect .",
    "the slight offset between the pulsar s inferred trajectory and the snr s geometric center possibly results from a density gradient into which the snr is expanding , or from a slightly offset explosion within a pre - existing cavity .",
    "the only difficulty with this picture is that the system s age must then be many times larger than the pulsar s characteristic age , which is not seen in other pulsar / snr associations .",
    "the proposed explanation is that the surface magnetic field of the pulsar is at the present epoch growing on a time scale of @xmath110  kyr .",
    "this effect is consistent with the properties of other pulsar / snr associations , and is possibly also being seen in the long - term timing signatures of several pulsars @xcite .",
    "the alternative is that the pulsar is @xmath110  kyr old as indicated by its characteristic age , and is unassociated with snr  .",
    "this explanation eliminates the need to invoke off - center cavity explosions , re - energized shells or growing magnetic fields to explain the observations .",
    "however , this interpretation offers no easy explanation for the morphology of  which , contrary to the proposal of tbg02 , can not be easily explained as a relic nebula left behind at the pulsar s birth site .",
    "this model also requires that the brightened emission and flat spectrum of the snr near the pulsar be a coincidence .",
    "frustratingly , a full understanding of the duck remains elusive .",
    "however , future vla or vlba observations of psr  should eventually detect motion .",
    "furthermore , an x - ray detection of  and of the eastern parts of   should provide additional constraints on the properties of the system ( see discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while continued timing of the pulsar may be able to indicate the nature of the braking torque and magnetic field evolution in this source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , other similar systems might provide additional clues .",
    "psr  b1951 + 32 is clearly in the process of puncturing the shell of the snr  ctb  80 @xcite , while psr  j10165857 and snr g284.31.8 have been proposed as another such interacting system @xcite . over the ensemble of galactic pulsars and snrs ,",
    "@xcite predict approximately half a dozen systems in which the pulsar has recently penetrated the snr shell .",
    "searches for further interacting pairs may thus prove fruitful .",
