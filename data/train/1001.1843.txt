    "in the vitreous and liquid states , at ambient pressure , germania ( geo@xmath0 ) ( a close structural analog of silica ( sio@xmath0 ) ) forms a tetrahedrally coordinated three - dimensional network @xcite . because of its lower abundance , its usage in practical applications is much less widespread than for the sio@xmath0 .",
    "still , geo@xmath0 is used in several fields , mainly related to optical technologies .",
    "for example , a mixture of sio@xmath0 and geo@xmath0 allows precise control of refractive index in optical fibres and waveguides .",
    "it is of interest to develop simulation methods to allow a detailed examination of the local structure in such mixtures and to predict the infrared spectrum , since this determines the long wavelength limit for their use as optical fibres .",
    "the essential similarity between the structures of glassy geo@xmath0 , sio@xmath0 and bef@xmath0 was made clear by the study of vibrational properties by galeener and co - workers @xcite who showed that the inelastic neutron , infrared and raman spectra of the different materials were closely related .",
    "more recent infrared studies of geo@xmath0 have also been reported @xcite . recently",
    "a full set of partial structure factors were determined in this system by using the method of isotopic substitution in neutron diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "the results show that the tetrahedral network structure is based on corner sharing ge(o@xmath1)@xmath2 tetrahedra with a ge - o average distance of 1.73    and with a mean inter - tetrahedral ge - o - ge angle of 132@xmath3 .",
    "they also show that the topological and chemical ordering in the network display two characteristic length scales at distances greater than the nearest neighbour .",
    "several molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been undertaken to study the structural and vibrational properties of the disordered phases of geo@xmath0 .",
    "classical md simulations were performed on glassy and liquid geo@xmath0 @xcite , using pairwise additive potentials with partial charges developed by oeffner and elliott ( oe ) for modeling the @xmath4-quartz and rutilelike phases of geo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "more recently , first - principles molecular dynamics ( fpmd ) of glassy geo@xmath0 have also been reported @xcite . in principle",
    ", the amount of empirical information needed to set up a first - principles calculation is minimal and it would normally be the method of choice to study the physico - chemical properties of condensed phase systems . however , it is computationally very expensive compared to classical molecular dynamics , which is a major drawback when dealing with glassy systems .",
    "classical and fpmd simulations were also compared one with each other in a combined study@xcite for temperatures above 2530  k. in this study _",
    "apparent _ inconsistencies between the properties predicted by the classical simulations of different authors are noted . in reality , two _ different _ parameter sets were proposed by oe : an original one , which was fitted from an _ ab initio _ energy surface , and a so - called rescaled one , which was developed from the previous one in order to give a better reproduction of the vibrational properties .",
    "for example , the partial charge of the germanium ion was shifted from 1.5  @xmath5 in the original potential to 0.94174  @xmath5 in the rescaled potential .",
    "the apparent inconsistencies arise because different classical potentials were being used .",
    "our objective is a single potential which will give a good description of structure and dynamics and allow long simulations on systems of many atoms .",
    "the structure of the simulated system can directly be compared with the neutron / x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "both classical and fpmd simulation provide structure factors which are in rather good agreement with experiments . for the classical molecular dynamics ,",
    "the most noticeable difference is a shift to high @xmath6-values of the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) , which was observed with both versions of the oe potential @xcite . as this peak",
    "is associated to medium range distances @xcite , this means that the ge - o - ge bond angle is too large and the topology of the tetrahedral network is not correctly described .",
    "the fpmd simulations provide a diffraction pattern with improved agreement @xcite , but the small size / timescales explored lead to large statistical uncertainties , mainly in the region of this fsdp .",
    "the vibrational properties can also be straightforwardly calculated .",
    "the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) was estimated from fpmd and classical md using the rescaled oe potential , with an overall reasonable agreement with the available experimental data extracted from inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the infrared absorption spectrum , which originates from the polarization fluctuations associated with motion of the atomic charges , has only been reported from the fpmd simulation .",
    "the agreement with experiment @xcite was overall good , despite a small shift of the peaks towards lower frequencies .",
    "the dynamical properties which involve structural rearrangements are out of reach of the fpmd .",
    "the only studies on geo@xmath0 employ classical md , and were aimed at determining the diffusion coefficients in the liquid state @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite observed important differences between their values and those obtained by micoulaut _",
    "_ @xcite ; their hypothesis for rationalizing this discrepancy was inadequate equilibration in the latter .",
    "in fact , as noted above , it is due to the use of the two different oe potentials in these studies .",
    "indeed , in simulations performed with the rescaled oe potential the fluidity of the system is enhanced by more than one order of magnitude compared to the results obtained with the original oe potential .    in this work",
    "we describe the parameterization of a new classical md interaction potential for geo@xmath0 , by using some techniques we have developed for halides and oxides @xcite , which is entirely based on first - principles electronic structure calculations . in order to provide an accurate",
    ", transferable description of the interactions , these potentials include dipole polarization effects and the ions carry full valence charges .",
    "the various structural , dynamical and vibrational properties are then compared with the corresponding experimental results . in future work",
    "we will use such potentials to study mixtures and the effect of pressure on glassy geo@xmath0",
    "the interaction model used in this work is related to that used in previous work@xcite , with a couple of minor differences . the model ( known as dippim )",
    "includes a pair potential , together with an account of the polarization effects which result from the induction of dipoles on the o@xmath7 ions .",
    "the parameters for these potentials were obtained by force - matching them to first - principles reference data @xcite .",
    "such an approach was successfully applied in the case of other oxide materials @xcite .",
    "tangney and scandolo @xcite also used a similar interaction model to study silica , in which all the parameters including partial charges on the ions were fitted against first - principles data . here",
    "we use formal ionic charges ( ge@xmath8 , o@xmath7 ) which should ensure a better transferability . in the next paragraphs",
    "we will give a brief description of the model used , the first - principles reference calculations and the force - matching procedure .",
    "the interatomic potential is constructed from four components : charge - charge , dispersion , overlap repulsion and polarization .",
    "the first three components are purely pairwise additive : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the _ formal _ charge on ion @xmath11 .",
    "the dispersion interactions include dipole - dipole and dipole - quadrupole terms @xmath12.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the dipole - dipole and dipole - quadrupole dispersion coefficients , respectively , and the @xmath15 are the tang - tonnies dispersion damping function , which describe short - range corrections to the asymptotic dispersion term .",
    "the short range repulsive terms are approximately exponential in the region of physical interionic separations .",
    "the full expression used here for the short range repulsion is : @xmath16 where the second term is a gaussian which acts as a steep repulsive wall and accounts for the anion hard core ; these extra terms are used in cases where the ions are strongly polarized to avoid instability problems at very small anion - cation separations @xcite .",
    "the polarization part of the potential incorporates dipolar effects only .",
    "this reads : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the polarizability of ion @xmath11 , @xmath19 are the dipoles and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the charge - dipole and dipole - dipole interaction tensors : + @xmath22 the instantaneous values of these moments are obtained by minimization of this expression with respect to the dipoles of all ions at each md timestep .",
    "this ensures that we regain the condition that the dipole induced by an electrical field @xmath23 is @xmath24 and that the dipole values are mutually consistent .",
    "the short - range induction effects on the dipoles are taken into account by the tang - toennies damping functions : @xmath25 the parameters @xmath26 determine the range at which the overlap of the charge densities affects the induced dipoles , the parameters @xmath27 determine the strength of the ion response to this effect .",
    "it is important to notice that anion - anion damping terms have been taken into account , contrary to what was done in @xcite .",
    "the addition of anion - anion damping terms was found to greatly improve the ability to match the first - principles data .",
    "the parameters in the interaction potential are determined by matching the dipoles and forces on the ions calculated from first - principles on condensed phase ionic configurations @xcite .",
    "starting from the empirical pair potential in @xcite , we obtained atomic configurations for geo@xmath0 by running short md simulations on small cells ( 150 ions ) ; a total of two liquid configurations were obtained for geo@xmath0 ; for each of these , the hellman - feynman forces acting on individual ions of the simulation cell were calculated using planewave - dft code cpmd @xcite . in all the calculations we used norm - conserving pseudopotentials and planewave energy cut - offs of @xmath28 ;",
    "all calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) according to the perdew , burke and ernzernhof ( pbe ) scheme . for the calculation of first - principles dipoles",
    ", the kohn - sham orbitals are localized via a wannier transformation to construct maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwf ) and the dipoles determined from the positions of the centres of the wannier functions associated with each ion @xcite .",
    "the potential parameters are optimized by fitting the forces and dipoles , obtained with the dippim potentials for the reference configurations , to the respective results from the dft calculations ; the 2 configurations provide a total of about 1800 data points to fit , comprising three cartesian force components of each individual ion and three components for the dipoles . while most of the potential parameters are left as free parameters in the fits , there are some exceptions .",
    "the o@xmath7 polarizability , for instance , was fixed to @xmath29 , i.e. the value salmon @xmath30 obtained experimentally in @xcite .",
    "this value for the oxide polarizability is also compatible with the range of values obtained for this quantity in several magmatic melts from first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "one problem in dft calculations is the uncontrolled representation of the dispersion interaction .",
    "although dispersion only contributes a tiny fraction to the total energy , it has a considerable influence on phase transition pressures and on the material density and stress tensor .",
    "for this reason , we decided not to include the dispersion parameters in the fits as discussed in @xcite and to add them afterwards .",
    "we used the parameters in @xcite for the oxygen terms and rescaled these by the ge polarizability for the anion - cation terms .",
    "the gaussian parameters too were added after the fit and then the comparison with the first - principles data was run again to check that its quality remained unchanged . in figure [ figureii ]",
    "we report the agreement between the dft calculated forces and dipoles and those predicted by the fitted potential , for a set of representative ions ; the abscissa shows the @xmath31 component of the forces and dipoles , while the ordinate is simply the ion number .",
    "the quality of the representation is quite good and comparable with the one obtained in @xcite ; this can be regarded as a very good result , considering the simplicity of the model ( both ion shape deformation effects and quadrupoles are not taken into account in the present model @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters obtained for the dippim potential are summarized in table [ tablei ] .",

    "we performed md simulations in the @xmath42 ensemble through the use of the nos - hoover chain thermostat method @xcite .",
    "the simulation cell contained 288 oxide and 144 germanium ions , and its volume was set to 6856  @xmath43 in order to match the experimental density at 300  k , which is 3.66  g.@xmath44 .",
    "we used a time step of 1  fs to integrate the equations of motion and the minimization of the polarization energy was carried out with a conjugate gradient method .",
    "the system was studied in both the liquid and amorphous phases .    for the amorphous phase ,",
    "the system was first equilibrated for 2  ns at the temperature of 4500  k. we have then cooled down the system with a cooling rate of 3.33@xmath4510@xmath46  k.s@xmath47 , by rescaling the velocities and decreasing the target temperature of the thermostat in order to reduce the temperature by 50  k every 150000 md steps .",
    "finally , a 5  ns long simulation was undertaken at 300  k , from which we computed all the data presented in this article .",
    "this procedure was performed with two different potentials , the dippim , and the original oe , which has extensively been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "a simulation at 300  k was also performed with the rescaled oe potential ( with one of the configurations obtained from simulations with the original oe potential as a starting configuration ) for the study of the vibrational properties .    for the liquid , a series of long simulations with the dippim potential at the temperatures of 3600  k , 3800  k , 4000  k , 4200  k , 4400  k , 4500  k , 4600  k , 4800  k and 5000  k was undertaken .",
    "in all the cases , an equilibration run was performed so that the slower species , ge , moved on average , at least a distance of @xmath48 ; a subsequent run of the same length was made to accumulate enough statistics for the mean - squared displacements curves . at these temperatures ,",
    "the runs were between 100,000 and 1,000,000 steps .",
    "both the original and rescaled oe potentials were also used within the same simulation conditions at a temperature of 3600  k.",
    "neutron diffraction experiments with the isotope substitution technique allowed salmon to determine very precisely the full set of partial radial distribution functions ( rdf ) @xcite . these provide a good check of the validity of the potential .",
    "the experimental rdfs are given in figure [ rdf ] , together with the ones obtained from our simulations at 300  k involving the dippim and the original oe potential ; it can be readily observed that our dippim potential gives a closer match with the experimental data than the oe potential , for which all the characteristic first - neighbour distances are slightly overestimated . concerning the shape of the function , the peaks obtained for the ge - ge and ge - o partials are too sharp but it has be",
    "be remembered that other factors , such as system size and cooling rate , also play a role in this aspect of the comparison .",
    "the o - o partial rdf is almost in perfect agreement with the experimental one , this is very important since the o@xmath7 anions constitute 2/3 of the atoms of the system and their packing arrangement determines the arrangement of the tetrahedral network .",
    "the oe potential gives a reasonable description of the static structure ( though significantly poorer than the dippim one ) ; one might therefore be tempted to use this potential , due to its simpler form and faster computational time ; we will see in the next sections that a reasonable reproduction of the structure might not be sufficient for it to be capable of predicting the dynamical and vibrational properties .",
    "in this section we will calculate diffusion coefficients for the liquid and compare them both with those obtained with the oe potentials and with the experimental values .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of species @xmath4 can be obtained from the slope of the mean squared displacement at long times , i.e. @xmath49 where @xmath50 the mean squared displacement curves were evaluated from a series of long simulations at temperatures between 3600 k and 5000 k ; these are shown on a log - log scale on figure [ msd ] .",
    "no plateau is observed even at the lowest temperature , which shows that the system remains liquid in the range of the study .",
    "the diffusion coefficients were extracted using equation [ eq - diffusion ] ; these are reported in figure [ diff - coeff ] and compared with those obtained with the oe and rescaled oe potentials .",
    "figure [ diff - coeff ] shows many interesting features : first of all , our dippim potential gives approximately the same value for the diffusion coefficients as the original oe potential .",
    "hawlitzky @xmath51@xcite used this potential to calculate the diffusion coefficients and showed that the obtained values are in good agreement with the experimental ones obtained by converting viscosity data ; we can therefore conclude that our dippim potential gives a good agreement with the experimental data as well .",
    "a direct comparison with experimental data might be done by using the only published datum ( @xmath52  @xmath53s@xmath47 ) on the oxygen diffusion constant @xcite , at @xmath54=1440  k. however , such a low diffusion coefficient would involve an impossibly long simulation run .",
    "+ it is also interesting to see that the rescaled oe potential yields too fluid a melt if compared with the original oe and dippim potentials and with experimental data .",
    "this potential was used by micoulaut _",
    "et al._@xcite and they indeed obtained diffusion coefficients which were more than one order of magnitude larger than the values obtained by hawlitzky _ et al._@xcite ( who incorrectly explained this discrepancy in terms of lack of equilibration of the simulations , it is obvious here that the real reason was the difference between the two potentials ) .",
    "the so - called rescaled potential was obtained by taking the normal oe potential and rescaling the ionic charges , the van der waals coefficient and the repulsive parameters in order to get a better agreement with the experimental vibrational spectrum for the crystal . to do this",
    "the parameters which are responsible for the strength of the the o - o and o - ge short range repulsion were lowered by a factor of approximately 2.5 ; as a consequence , these ions can diffuse much more easily in a softer environment .",
    "the infrared spectra of ionic melts with polyvalent cations exhibit discrete bands attributable to the vibrational motion of the local coordination complexes around the cations .",
    "they originate from the polarization fluctuations associated with motion of the ionic charges . the inclusion of polarization effects for the oxide ions in our model may influence the predicted spectrum in two ways @xcite .",
    "first , the interactions of the oxide ion dipoles may alter the local structure of the network and the strength of the bonds , which may introduce a shift of the vibrational frequencies .",
    "second , the induced dipoles will themselves be responsible for absorption , as they too contribute to the total polarization fluctuations .",
    "the absorption coefficient in the presence of these extra moments is calculated from the imaginary part of the total dielectric function @xmath55 $ ] , which can be determined following caillol , levesque and weis@xcite as @xmath56    where @xmath57 @xmath58 is the charge current @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the total system induced dipole moment , @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ dielectric ] shows the imaginary part of the total dielectric function calculated for simulations carried out with the dippim potential , compared to the one obtained from fpmd simulations @xcite and from several experiments @xcite ( the spectrum proposed by kamitsos _ et al . _",

    "three main bands are observed on the spectra , in good agreement with the other studies .",
    "the corresponding characteristic peak frequencies for the absorption spectra are summarized in table [ tableii ] .",
    "the agreement is very satisfactory ; the frequencies obtained match very closely to the various experimental results ( even though these show a significant scatter ) , while the fpmd simulation seems to systematically underestimate them .",
    "the relative intensities of the bands is also in good agreement with experiment , though the highest frequency band at around 894  cm@xmath47 is not intense enough in our spectrum .",
    ".[tableii ] characteristic frequencies of the imaginary part of the dielectric function as obtained from the dippim model , compared to previous fpmd simulations @xcite and to experimental results @xcite .",
    "all the frequencies are given in cm@xmath47 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the importance of polarization effects in determining the relative intensities of the bands can be demonstrated by separating the various contributions to the absorption spectrum . in the case of glassy silica @xcite and beryllium fluoride @xcite ,",
    "it was observed that the interference between the induced dipoles and permanent charge contributions to the total polarization , contained in the @xmath63 cross term , is responsible for the changes of the relative intensities .",
    "figure [ decompo ] shows the decomposition of the absorption spectrum in the case of glassy geo@xmath0 .",
    "the two main contributions are the charge fluctuation and the cross term ; both show bands at the same intensities .",
    "note that the cross - term strongly reduces the intensity of the two low frequency bands relative to that which would be obtained from the charge fluctuations alone , whereas for the high - frequency band the cancellation is much weaker .",
    "for the high frequency band the relationship of the charge - charge and cross - terms is different to that found previously for sio@xmath0 and bef@xmath0@xcite . in the latter cases ,",
    "the charge - charge and cross - terms had the same sign , so that the net band intensity was slightly larger than that predicted by the charge - charge term alone .",
    "this difference in the behaviour of the calculated spectra might arise from the inclusion of an anion - anion damping term in the polarization part of the interaction potential here , which was not the case for the previous studies .        we can now attempt to associate these ir frequencies with the vibrational modes of the system .",
    "the upper part of figure [ tdos ] shows the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) of each ion .",
    "some of these features can be associated to the vibrations of the geo@xmath2 tetrahedra by comparing them with the tetrahedral - vdos as obtained from the correlation functions of the velocities of various local tetrahedral symmetry coordinates .",
    "the latter would correspond to the velocities of geo@xmath2 normal modes , if the tetrahedra were isolated ( _ i.e. _ not mechanically linked in a network ) . for a tetrahedral molecule , vibrational normal",
    "coordinates @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , symmetric stretch ) , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , bend ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 , asymmetric stretch ) and @xmath70 ( @xmath69 , bend ) are expected @xcite . we may obtain velocities associated with the symmetry coordinates of each geo@xmath2 unit .",
    "for example , for the symmetric stretching motion @xmath71 where @xmath11 labels the ge of a tetrahedral complex , and @xmath72 the four oxide anions at the vertices .",
    "@xmath73 is the projection of the relative velocity of @xmath72 along the @xmath74 bond , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath75 similar expressions may be written down for the velocities of the other symmetry coordinates @xcite .",
    "the corresponding dos is then obtained by a fourier transform of the corresponding velocity autocorrelation function : @xmath76     ( symmetric stretch ) , @xmath69 ( asymmetric stretch ) , @xmath67 ( bend ) , and @xmath69 ( bend ) modes of the ge0@xmath2 tetrahedra ( bottom panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]   ( symmetric stretch ) , @xmath69 ( asymmetric stretch ) , @xmath67 ( bend ) , and @xmath69 ( bend ) modes of the ge0@xmath2 tetrahedra ( bottom panel).,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    were the network to vibrate as a collection of isolated tetrahedra , the spectra of each tetrahedral - vdos would exhibit a single peak corresponding to the characteristic frequency of the corresponding normal mode of vibration .",
    "the four tetrahedral - vdos are shown on the lower part of figure [ tdos ] , it is clear that it is not the case here .",
    "each spectra consists in the superposition of several bands , which shows the existence of some important coupling between the symmetry coordinates .",
    "it is therefore difficult to assign the ir features to the different modes . in particular , all of the three bands observed in the ir spectrum appear in the tetrahedral - vdos of the bending @xmath67 and @xmath69 modes .",
    "the other @xmath69 modes , which is associated to some kind of stretching of the tetrahedra , only exhibits the medium and high frequency modes . finally , the @xmath65 stretching spectrum exhibits two bands at frequencies centered on the values of 510 and 970  cm@xmath47 , which do not appear on the ir spectrum .",
    "such a mode of this symmetry is indeed not expected to be ir active for an isolated tetrahedral molecule , since it corresponds to the symmetric breathing mode .",
    "coming back to the total vdos of each ion , the low frequency vibrations are not associated to any of the tetrahedral modes . in fact these are due to some slow collective bending of two tetrahedra linked by a bridging oxide anion @xcite , so that they would not appear in the dos of a single tetrahedron .",
    "the vibrational properties of the system as obtained with the original and rescaled oe interaction potentials have also been computed .",
    "as these potentials do not include any polarization effect , it is only possible to compare the charge - charge current contributions to the ir absorption spectrum with the one obtained with the dippim potential .",
    "the obtained spectra are given on figure [ epsilonqq ] .",
    "unsurprisingly , the original oe potential seem to fail completely in describing the vibrational properties of geo@xmath0 ; this is the reason why the rescaled oe potential had to be developed . for that potential ,",

    ", it does not appear for the rescaled oe potential .",
    "instead there appears a shoulder to the small frequency band , for frequencies ranging from 400 to 500  cm@xmath47 . as these bands were associated to the @xmath69 stretching and bending modes on the tetrahedral - vdos , this means that this modes are not correctly depicted by the rescaled oe potential .    , where @xmath77 is the partial charge carried by the oxide ion in the corresponding potential .",
    ", width=340 ]",
    "in conclusion , the obtained potential seem to reproduce all the studied properties ( structural , dynamical and vibrational ) to a high degree of precision . since there was no reference at all to any experimental data in the parameterization of this potential , this represents a strong test of the model reliability .",
    "the study of pressurized germania is among our top priorities for future work .",
