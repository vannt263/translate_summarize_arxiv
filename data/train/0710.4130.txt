    "the casimir effect @xcite was studied in various specific cases and geometries @xcite .",
    "a new geometry that recently attracted attention in the theory of the casimir effect is the piston geometry .",
    "a piston plate is perpendicular to the walls of a semi - infinite cylinder and moves freely inside it , this geometry was first investigated in a @xmath0 dirichlet model @xcite .    an exact solution for a perfectly conducting square piston at zero temperature",
    "was found in a @xmath1 model in the electromagnetic and scalar cases @xcite by making use of a geometric optics approach ; the limit of short distances between the piston and the base of a cylinder was found in @xcite for an arbitrary cross section of a piston ; rectangular geometries and finite temperatures were considered in @xcite .    in this paper and our previous related papers @xcite we considered a slightly different geometry - two piston plates inside an infinite cylinder , which yielded the same results for rectangular pistons as in the case of a semi - infinite cylinder due to perfectly conducting boundary conditions . in @xcite",
    "an exact solution for arbitrary cross sections and arbitrary distances between piston plates was found at zero and finite temperatures in the electromagnetic @xmath1 case .",
    "rectangular and circular cross sections are special cases of our general solution .",
    "a dilute circular piston and cylinder were studied perturbatively in @xcite . in this case",
    "the force on two plates inside a cylinder and the force in a piston geometry differ essentially .",
    "the force in a piston geometry can change sign in this approximation for thin enough walls of the material .",
    "different examples of pistons in a scalar case were investigated in @xcite .",
    "the case when the piston s cross section differs from that of a cylinder was recently studied numerically @xcite and by means of a geometric optics approach @xcite .",
    "everywhere in this paper we study casimir energies of an electromagnetic field with perfectly conducting boundary conditions imposed .",
    "first we study the energy of a rectangular cavity by making use of pistons interactions .",
    "then we generalize the formulas for the case of a 3d piston with an arbitrary cross section and consider several special and limiting cases .",
    "our formulas can be applied in every case when the two dimensional dirichlet and neumann boundary problems for helmholtz equation can be solved analytically or numerically .",
    "we take @xmath2 .",
    "the casimir energy can be regularized as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is large enough to make ( [ f23 ] ) convergent",
    ". then it should be continued analytically ( [ f23 ] ) to the value @xmath5 , this procedure yields the renormalized finite casimir energy .",

    "imagine that a piston is large in two dimensions with sides @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( plates @xmath20 and @xmath21 on fig.@xmath20 ) . in this case",
    "the contribution to the energy in this geometry is given by the casimir result for two parallel plates with the surface area @xmath22 and the edge term @xmath23 : @xmath24 where one of the terms in @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is taken into account .",
    "the next step is to move other pistons ( plates @xmath27 and @xmath28 on fig.@xmath20 ) that have a large side @xmath18 between these already existing parallel plates .",
    "the energy change is equal to @xmath29 where @xmath30 in ( [ ch2 ] ) another term in @xmath31 was taken into account ( @xmath32 is a distance between the two piston plates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath33 ) . from the energy change ( [ ch2 ] ) it is straightforward to obtain the force on the piston plates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and in the limit @xmath34 one",
    "immediately obtains the exact force on a unit length of stripes @xmath27 and @xmath28 from @xmath35 .",
    "the expression for the energy change ( [ ch1 ] ) is valid only when @xmath36 is much smaller than the sizes of the plates @xmath20,@xmath21 , and ( [ ch2 ] ) is valid when @xmath32 is much smaller than @xmath18 and of the order @xmath36 or less .",
    "some comments are needed to clarify the meaning of the terms @xmath37 in the energy expression ( [ box ] ) .",
    "these terms appear due to edges of the piston .",
    "they are precisely equal to next to leading order terms in the expansion ( [ r23 ] ) , which means that they account for @xmath28 rectangular edges ( @xmath38 ) of the finite piston in two different expansions ( for small @xmath36 and small @xmath32 ) .    the next possible step is to insert pistons @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the opposite sides of the existing waveguide with sides @xmath36 and @xmath32 and move them towards each other .",

    "the force on the pistons @xmath39 and @xmath40 is straightforward .    in summary ,",
    "the expression @xmath45 yields the energy change inside a cavity volume with sides @xmath46 during a construction of the following system :    step @xmath20 : : :    pistons @xmath20 and @xmath21 are being moved inside a    waveguide with large sides @xmath47 from a large    distance between them towards each other until the distance    @xmath36 between them is achieved . for a validity of the energy    change ( [ ch1 ] )",
    "it is necessary to assume    @xmath48 .",

    "it is assumed here that    @xmath54 .",
    "however , the formula ( [ lm3 ] ) itself is exact    for arbitrary values of @xmath42 in the limit    @xmath34 , i.e. for plates inside an infinite    waveguide .    during each step the energy in the system decreases .    in the limit of infinite plates",
    "@xmath55 and stripes @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) the total energy change ( steps @xmath58 ) inside the cavity volume with sides @xmath46 can be written in the form : @xmath59",
    "suppose there are two plates inside an infinite cylinder of an arbitrary cross section @xmath60 ( fig.@xmath21 ) . to calculate the force on each plate imagine that @xmath28 parallel plates are inserted inside an infinite cylinder and then @xmath21 exterior plates are moved to spatial infinity .",
    "this situation is exactly equivalent to @xmath27 perfectly conducting cavities touching each other . from the energy of this system one has to subtract the casimir energy of an infinite cylinder without plates inside it .",
    "doing so we obtain the energy of interaction between the interior parallel plates and the attractive force on each interior plate inside the cylinder : @xmath61 the sum here is over all @xmath62 and @xmath63 eigenfrequencies @xmath64 for a cylinder with the cross section @xmath60 and an infinite length .",
    "in fact , the casimir energy of our electromagnetic system is proportional to the sum of free energies for two boson scalar fields ( with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions imposed at the boundary of an infinite cylinder with a cross section @xmath60 and zero neumann eigenvalue excluded ) at finite temperature @xmath65 if we make a substitution @xmath66 .",
    "free energies have a well defined finite part , their sum up to a factor @xmath67 coincides with ( [ r7 ] ) .",
    "one can rewrite ( [ r7 ] ) in a different form : @xmath68 here @xmath69 the results ( [ r7 ] ) , ( [ p10 ] ) are our main zero temperature results .",
    "our results are _",
    "exact for an arbitrary curved geometry of a cylinder_.        for a rectangular cylinder with sides @xmath36 and @xmath32 the exact casimir energy of two plates inside it can be written as : @xmath70 the term @xmath71 is omitted in the sum .    for a circular cylinder",
    "the eigenvalues of the two dimensional helmholtz equation @xmath72 are determined by the roots of bessel functions and derivatives of bessel functions .",
    "the exact casimir energy of two circular plates of the radius @xmath36 separated by a distance @xmath42 inside an infinite circular cylinder of the radius @xmath36 is given by : @xmath73 the sum is over positive @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the leading asymptotic behaviour of @xmath76 for long distances @xmath77",
    ", @xmath78 is determined by the lowest positive eigenvalues of the two dimensional dirichlet and neumann problems @xmath79 : @xmath80 so the casimir force between the two plates in a cylinder is exponentially small for long distances .",
    "this important property of the solution is due to the gap in the frequency spectrum or , in other words , it is due to the finite size of the cross section of the cylinder . due to this property",
    "one needs a finite number of the eigenvalues of the helmholtz equation for @xmath81 dirichlet and neumann boundary problems ( [ helm1]-[helm4 ] ) to obtain the casimir energy at a specific distance @xmath42 between the plates with a desired accuracy .    the free energy at a temperature @xmath65 describing the interaction of two parallel perfectly conducting plates inside an infinite perfectly conducting cylinder with the cross section @xmath60 has the form : @xmath82 this is our central finite temperature result .",
    "note that @xmath83 .",
    "we used the standard notation @xmath84 .    in the long distance limit",
    "@xmath85 one has to keep only @xmath86 term in @xmath87 .",
    "thus the free energy of the plates inside a cylinder in the high temperature limit is equal to : @xmath88 one can check that the limit @xmath89 , @xmath90 in ( [ r24 ] ) immediately yields the known high temperature result for two parallel perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance @xmath42 @xcite .    for @xmath91 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 one can use the heat kernel expansion @xcite and properties of the zeta function @xcite to obtain the leading terms for the free energy : @xmath92 where @xmath93 here @xmath94 is an area of the cross section @xmath60 , @xmath95 is the interior angle of each sharp corner at the boundary @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the curvature of each boundary smooth section described by the curve @xmath98 .",
    "the force calculated from ( [ r23 ] ) coincides with the zero temperature force @xmath99 in @xcite , ( eq.7 ) .",
