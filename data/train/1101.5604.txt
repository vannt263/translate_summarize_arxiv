    "as an alternative way to study the higgs boson production at the lhc , the central exclusive diffractive ( ced ) production has been currently analyzed as a new framework for particle production @xcite .",
    "indeed , the double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) and the two - photon process offer the opportunity to study the exclusive higgs boson production in proton and nuclei collisions .",
    "one way to increase these cross sections is to consider nuclei collisions , especially for the two - photon process , where the photon flux is enhanced by a factor of @xmath3 in @xmath1 collisions , and @xmath4 in @xmath5 ones .",
    "for instance , the predicted cross section for the higgs boson production in pbpb collisions is 18 pb @xcite , which is enhanced by five orders if compared to the predictions for @xmath0 collisions ( 0.18 fb ) .",
    "however , in dpe this enhancement is smaller , showing an increasing from 3 fb for @xmath0 collisions to 100 fb in auau ones @xcite . in this sense , we compute the cross sections with the photoproduction mechanism for the ced higgs boson production in hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions at the lhc .",
    "considering the @xmath6 interaction in high - energy collisions , we compute the cross section for the ced higgs boson production by dpe in the @xmath6 subprocess @xcite , which is one of the possible subprocess in ultraperipheral collisions ( upc ) @xcite .",
    "the photon fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair , and then the interaction occurs between the proton and this pair by the exchange of gluons in the @xmath7-channel .    the diagram at partonic level is taken into account in order to compute the scattering amplitude , where a quasi - real photon interacts with a quark nto the proton .",
    "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is computed by the use of the cutkosky rules @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the amplitudes in the left- and the right - hand sides of the central line that splits the diagram in fig.[fig1 ] in two pieces , and @xmath11 is the volume element of the three - body phase space .",
    "this integration results in the following amplitude @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the impact factor for the @xmath14-@xmath14 transition @xmath15[\\rho^{2 } + ( 1 - \\rho)^{2}]}{q^{2}\\rho(1 - \\rho ) + \\mathbf{k}^{2}\\tau(1 - \\tau ) } , \\label{imp - fact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath16 is the virtuality of the initial photon , @xmath17 = 246 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the electroweak theory , @xmath18 is the charge of the quark in the dipole , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electromagnetic and strong coupling constants , respectively , @xmath21 is the feynman parameter , and @xmath22 is the transverse momentum of the gluons . in this calculation , we introduce the sudakov parametrization @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "diagram that represents the photoproduction mechanism for the higgs boson production . ]    in order to include all the partonic content of the proton , one has to replace the contribution of the @xmath25 coupling by the unintegrated parton distribution function @xmath26 , where the function @xmath27 is the integrated gluon distribution function , and the multiplicative factor @xmath28 = 1.2 takes into account the non - diagonality of the distribution @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply the mstw2008lo parametrization for such distribution function @xcite .    to obtain the event rate , one have to integrate the amplitude",
    "squared given by eq.([amp - im ] ) over the momenta of the particles in the final state , including the prescription for @xmath29 .",
    "the result for central rapidity reads @xmath30^{2 } , \\label{gammap - xsec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is taken to 1.5 , which corresponds to the enhancement of the @xmath32 cross section at nlo accuracy @xcite , and @xmath33 = 5.5 gev@xmath34 is the slope of the gluon - proton form factor .",
    "the function @xmath35 is the modified unintegrated gluon distribution function that includes the sudakov form factor @xmath36 computed at leading logarithm accuracy ( lla ) .",
    "regarding the phenomenological aspects introduced in this result , the rapidity gap survival probability ( gsp ) depends particularly of the process under consideration .",
    "the gsp for the @xmath6 process is not computed yet , and we use the one of 3% predicted for the pomeron - pomeron mechanism .",
    "however , we expect a higher survival factor for the @xmath6 interaction , since the large distances between the two colliding hadrons in upc should decrease the probability of interaction between secondary particles .",
    "analyzing the results for central dijet production at hera , one finds that the survival probability is about 10% @xcite , and we make predictions with this probability for the ced higgs boson photoproduction .",
    "the initial photon is emitted from one relativistic source object , which can be a proton or a nucleus .",
    "particularly , a nucleus has @xmath3 protons , which enhances the photon flux in @xmath1 and @xmath5 collisions . in fact , considering the luminosity and pile - up effects in the collisions at the lhc , the @xmath1 collisions may offer the best experimental condition if compared to @xmath0 and @xmath5 collisions @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the photoproduction mechanism , we neglect the contribution from @xmath5 collisions , since the shadowing effects present in the nuclear pdf will decrease the production cross section by a factor of 0.2 - 0.3 .",
    "the production cross section in upc is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is given by eq.([gammap - xsec ] ) .",
    "the functions @xmath41 are the photon fluxes for protons and nuclei , which can be found in ref.@xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the photon virtuality is decomposed into @xmath42 , with @xmath43 , which is restricted by the coherence condition in upc , depending of the radius of the source object .",
    "the hadronic cross section is computed for @xmath0 , @xmath2pb , @xmath2au , @xmath2ar , and @xmath2o collisions at the lhc .",
    "actually , collisions involving gold nucleus are not going to be measured in the lhc , however we include such prediction to compare with previous results @xcite .",
    "the tab.[tab1 ] shows the kinematics introduced in this calculation , and the predicted cross sections for the ced higgs boson photoproduction for the two possibilities of the survival factor .",
    ".[tab1]the predicted cross sections for the ced higgs boson photoproduction at the lhc for @xmath44=120 gev , and the kinematics parameters .",
    "the cross section is shown for the two possibilities of the gsp : 3% and 10% . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as one can see , the production cross section is significantly enhanced in @xmath1 collisions taking nucleus with high @xmath3 .",
    "these results are higher than the ones obtained for the two - photon and for the dpe mechanism . in the case of @xmath0 collisions ,",
    "the cross section is similar to that of the dpe mechanism , but one order higher than that for the two - photon mechanism .",
    "considering the @xmath5 run that will occur in the end of 2010 , new data can be available for nuclei collisions in the next year .",
    "in this work we applied the photoproduction mechanism for the ced higgs boson production to @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions in the lhc .",
    "the results show an enhanced cross sections for collisions involving au and pb nucleus , which open a new way to detect the higgs boson in the lhc .",
    "the gsp is a fundamental aspect to be determined with the future data from the lhc , playing an important role for reliable predictions of diffractive processes .",
    "therefore , the photoproduction mechanism offers a new approach for the higgs boson production , showing a cross section competitive with other production mechanisms ."
