    "asteroseismology has the potential to provide new insights into the physics of stellar interiors . among the most promising objects that can be studied through this technique are the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars .",
    "these pulsate in high - overtone , low - degree , nonradial @xmath1-modes , with periods in the range @xmath2min . in a previous study hubrig et al .",
    "( 2000 ) discussed the relationship between the roap stars and the non - oscillating ap ( noap ) stars and concluded that the noap stars are , in general , slightly more evolved than the roap stars .",
    "cunha ( 2002 ) predicted the theoretical edges of the instability strip appropriate to roap stars and compared them with the observations . according to her predictions , stars that are more luminous and/or more evolved",
    "should pulsate with longer periods in the @xmath3-min range , and , as a result , their oscillations might have escaped detection in photometric surveys that have had low sensitivity to periods of this order .",
    "freyhammer et al .",
    "( in preparation ) have studied 9 evolved ap stars near the terminal age main sequence with high spectral resolution , high time resolution spectra obtained with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) . at precisions less than 60ms@xmath4 they found no pulsation in any of the nine stars , lending support to hubrig et al.s ( 2000 ) conclusion that that noap stars are somewhat more evolved than roap stars .",
    "nevertheless , there is one known evolved roap star with a 21.2-min period , hd116114 ( elkin et al .",
    "2005 ) , so we do know that more evolved ap stars can pulsate .",
    "it is important to our understanding of the driving mechanism for roap star pulsations to find what physical parameters govern which stars pulsate , and which do not .",
    "a current working hypothesis is that the pulsations are driven mostly by h ionisation ( see , e.g. , balmforth et al .",
    "2001 ; saio 2005 ) . the models of saio ( 2005 ) lead to a clear prediction that lower radial overtone pulsation modes typical of @xmath0sct stars are suppressed by the magnetic field in ap stars , hence should not be found amongst the roap stars .",
    "this is in general agreement with observations : at present there is no known magnetic @xmath0sct star .",
    "there are @xmath0sct stars that are classified as ap stars , but at classification dispersions magnetic ap stars and non - magnetic am stars can be confused , so that measurements of the magnetic fields are independently needed for @xmath0sct stars classified as ap stars .",
    "the most evolved star known that is classified as an ap star is hd21190 ( koen et al . 2001 ) which is also a known @xmath0sct star . in this paper",
    "we discuss our search for pulsational line profile variations in high time resolution uves spectra of hd21190 to test if it is an roap star , as well as a @xmath0sct star .",
    "we also give a more detailed analysis of the discovery of roap pulsations in the apsr star hd218994 , which was included in the sample of non - pulsating binary ap stars in the study hubrig et al .",
    "both of these stars are unusual , hence important : hd218994 is one of the most luminous roap stars , hence the discovery of pulsation makes it a potential test of cunha s ( 2002 ) theoretical instability strip .",
    "hd21190 is the only cool ap star that is also a @xmath0sct star . whether it is magnetic is still to be determined .",
    "our observations show it to be the best known example of a @xmath0sct star with moving bumps in its line profiles characteristic of high degree pulsation  making it a prime target for further study .",
    "the spectroscopic time series for hd21190 and hd218994 have been obtained on november 8 and november 3 2006 , respectively , at eso with the vlt uv - visual echelle spectrograph uves at ut2 .",
    "we used the uves dic2 standard setting covering the spectral range from 3300 to 4500  in the blue arm and from 5700 to 7600 in the red arm .",
    "the slit width was set to @xmath5 for the red arm , corresponding to a resolving power of @xmath6 .",
    "for the blue arm , we used the slit width of @xmath7 to achieve a resolving power of @xmath8 .",
    "further , we used the fast readout mode ( 625khz , 1x1 , low ) to keep readout and overhead time to about 30 s. for both stars we used exposure times of 3 min , obtaining time series with a resolution of about 3.7 min .",
    "the spectra were reduced by the uves pipeline data reduction software ( version 2.5 ; ballester et al .",
    "2000 ) and using standard iraf routines .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the obtained uves spectra range from 40 in the near uv ( 3500 ) to 150200 in the visual region ( 40007000 ) .",
    "hd21190 is a known @xmath0sct star with a variability period of 3.6h , discovered by the hipparcos mission .",
    "koen et al . ( 2001 ) determined the spectral type to be f2iii sreusi , making it the most evolved ap star known . according to cunha ( 2002 ) , longer period oscillations ( 20 - 25 min ) in magnetic roap stars",
    "should exist in the more evolved stars . to search for pulsational line profile variations on time scales shorter than typical @xmath0sct star pulsations ( of the order of hours )",
    ", we obtained for this star 14 uves spectra covering about 50 min , corresponding to @xmath9@xmath10 of the known @xmath0sct pulsation period . using hipparcos and asas ( pojmanski 2002 ) photometric databases ,",
    "we re - calculated the ephemeris and found that our observations correspond to the phase interval of decreasing brightness .",
    "[ fig.hd21190 ]                    the obtained spectra show broad spectral lines ( @xmath11kms@xmath4 ) , with small variable peaks in the line profiles ( fig.1 ) . in the bottom of fig.1 we present all the observed spectra stacked in two - dimensional images for two spectral regions .",
    "it can clearly be seen that three peaks are moving smoothly towards the red with a speed of 21kms@xmath4 per hour .",
    "however , no spectral features moving at higher frequencies were found in our spectra . to measure the radial velocities of these peaks we filtered lower spectral frequencies and used the cross - correlation method .",
    "similar splitting in the line profiles has been recently detected by yushchenko et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in two other @xmath0sct stars , @xmath0sct itself and hd57749 . also , high signal - to - noise spectroscopic time series observations by poretti for the @xmath0sct star fgvir , as reported by mittermayer & weiss ( 2003 ) , clearly show line profile variations similar to those found in our spectra",
    "these are the typical blue - to - red moving bumps that are seen for non - radial pulsations of non - axisymmetric m - modes in rapidly rotating stars where radial velocity doppler shifts the travelling waves of the individual pulsating surface segments , the seminal example being the late o star @xmath12oph ( vogt & penrod 1983 ) .",
    "hd218994 is a close visual binary system with a separation of 1.2arcsec ( renson et al .",
    "it is classified as a3sr in the michigan spectral catalogue ( houk & cowley 1975 ) .",
    "strmgren and h@xmath13 photometry were measured by martinez ( 1993 ) who found @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "hubrig et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimated @xmath19k from the @xmath13 index .",
    "martinez found @xmath20 and @xmath21 which are typical for a normal , main sequence a star .",
    "he showed that correction for reddening increases the @xmath22 index by about 0.02 and decreases the @xmath23 index by about 0.03 .",
    "this star is unusual among the roap stars for its nearly - normal @xmath22 and @xmath23 indexes . since most of the 36 known roap stars ( see kurtz et al .",
    "2006 for a list ) were found by photometric searches , this is an indication that radial velocity studies will discover many more roap stars that are difficult to detect in photometric studies .",
    "hd218994 is located in the same region of the parameter space in which rapid pulsations have been detected ( fig.2 ) , but an earlier search for pulsations in the cape survey yielded no detection ( martinez & kurtz 1994 ) .",
    "we have several additional unpublished photometric runs on this star that do not show roap - type pulsations .",
    "we obtained for this star 15 uves spectra with a time resolution of @xmath93 min . from our spectra",
    "we estimate @xmath24kms@xmath4 using the first zero of the fourier transform of the spectral line profile of the magnetically insensitive lines",
    ". numerous lines of rare earth elements ( such as those of ndii , ndiii , priii , euii and tbiii ) have been easily identified . to search for pulsational line variability , we calculated the average spectrum of the observed 15 spectra and subtracted it from the original spectra .",
    "we found for several rare earth lines a clear indication of variability .",
    "this star is thus the 36@xmath25 known roap star .",
    "[ fig.hr ]        the lines of fei , feii and the fe - peak elements show no radial velocity variations with a 1@xmath26 standard deviation per line in the range @xmath27ms@xmath4 .",
    "however , clear radial velocity variations are detected in the doubly ionised rare earth elements lines of ndiii and priii , as is typical for the roap stars ( see , e.g. , savanov , maluneschenko & ryabchikova 1999 ; kurtz , elkin & mathys 2005 ) .",
    "we note that the mean radial velocity for different elements is different with a range of a few kms@xmath4 , indicating the presence of chemical inhomogeneities on the stellar surface .",
    "we analysed 5 ndiii lines , 8 priii lines and a few lines of other ions for radial velocity variations using a discrete fourier transform ( kurtz 1985 ) .",
    "individual lines of ndiii and priii show the same peak with a frequency of 1.17mhz ( @xmath28min ) , confirming that the variation is in the star and is not instrumental .",
    "fig.3 shows a radial velocity curve for 4 of the ndiii lines averaged where the 14.2-min pulsation is easily seen .",
    "fig.4 shows the amplitude spectra for 5 ndiii lines and for 8 priii lines out to beyond the sampling frequency of 4.5 mhz .",
    "two peaks are seen , symmetrically placed on either side of the nyquist frequency . with the known range of pulsation periods of roap stars , @xmath29min , and our data sampling time of 3.7min , there is thus a potential ambiguity for the pulsation period of hd218994 .",
    "the nyquist frequency for our data is @xmath30mhz .",
    "as is expected for a purely sinusoidal variation and gaussian noise , there is a peak in fig.4 at 3.3mhz ( @xmath31mhz ; @xmath32min ) .",
    "see kurtz ( 1983 ) for a graphical demonstration of this effect .",
    "we consider it more likely that the 14.2-min period is the correct alias peak seen in fig.4 . but given that the shortest known period for an roap star ( hd134214 ) is only 5.65min , we do not rule out the possibility that the 3.3mhz peak is the correct one .",
    "higher time resolution data will resolve this issue , as is usual with questions of nyquist aliases . without another physical constraint on the choice of peak in fig.4",
    ", either choice is equally valid .",
    "we consider higher frequency nyquist aliases to be physically implausible  the usual assumption for roap stars . since each observational point represents the radial velocity averaged over the exposure time , the observed amplitude is reduced by a factor that depends on the ratio between the exposure time and the period .",
    "this effect reduces the observed amplitudes by a factor 0.52 for the 5.1 min period and by a factor of 0.93 for the 14.1-min period .",
    "we thus expect higher amplitudes to be measured with higher time resolution data .",
    "table  1 shows the least squares fit of the frequency 1.17mhz to the radial velocity variations of some selected lines and for sets of ndiii and priii lines .",
    "these results show that only priii and ndiii lines have significant radial velocity variations , with amplitudes at least four times the standard deviation of the measurements .",
    "the data suggest , but do not prove , a higher amplitude for the priii lines than for the ndiii lines .",
    "there is no significant phase shift between them . in many roap stars",
    "there appears to be an outwardly running wave with priii lines forming higher in the atmosphere than ndiii lines , hence a phase shift between them .",
    "it is often the case that the priii lines show higher amplitude , as is expected with the dropping atmospheric density . as our purpose here",
    "is to demonstrate unequivocally that pulsation is present , and as the data are sparse , we defer further interpretation to the acquisition of a more extensive data set .",
