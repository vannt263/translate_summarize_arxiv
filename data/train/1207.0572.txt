    "in the early 1980 s , conway and gordon  @xcite , and sachs  @xcite , showed that @xmath3 , the complete graph on six vertices , is _ intrinsically linked _ , i.e. , every embedding of it in @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) contains two disjoint cycles that form a nontrivial link .",
    "sachs  @xcite also showed that six other graphs , including @xmath0 ( the tri - partite graph on 3 , 3 , 1 vertices ) are intrinsically linked .",
    "in other words , the minimum number of nontrivial 2component links in any embedding of any of these graphs is one .",
    "it is not difficult to see that every graph can be embedded such that every pair of disjoint cycles forms a nontrivial link , i.e. , the attained maximum number of nontrivial 2component links among all embeddings of any graph is the number of pairs of disjoint cycles in the graph .",
    "thus , there exist embeddings of @xmath3 and @xmath0 with , respectively , 10 and 9 nontrivial 2component links .",
    "fleming and mellor  @xcite found either exact values , or lower- and upper - bounds , for the minimum number of nontrivial links in @xmath6partite graphs on 8 vertices , and in some larger complete bipartite graphs , embedded in @xmath4 .",
    "however , if one restricts attention to _ linear embeddings _ ( or _ straight - edge embeddings _ ) of graphs , i.e. , embeddings of graphs in @xmath4 in which every edge is a straight line segment , then these minimum and maximum values change .",
    "hughes  @xcite , and , independently , huh and jeon  @xcite showed that every linear embedding of @xmath3 contains exactly 1 or 3 nontrivial 2component links .",
    "work has also been done on the number of nontrivial knots , and links with more than two components , in linearly embedded graphs .",
    "ramirez alfonsin  @xcite showed that every linearly embedded @xmath7 contains a trefoil knot .",
    "huh  @xcite showed that every linearly embedded @xmath7 contains at most three figure eight knots .",
    "naimi and pavelescu  @xcite showed that every linearly embedded @xmath8 contains a nonsplit 3component link .",
    "none of these results hold if one does not require the embeddings to be linear .",
    "the main result of this paper is :    [ maintheorem ] there exists a linear embedding of @xmath0 with @xmath1 nontrivial 2component links if and only if @xmath2 , or 5 .",
    "we also show that in a linearly embedded @xmath0 with an odd number of nontrivial links all nontrivial links are hopf links , while in a linearly embedded @xmath0 with an even number of nontrivial links one nontrivial link is a @xmath9torus link and the rest are hopf links .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite were obtained by exhaustively checking large numbers of oriented matroids using computer programs .",
    "we initially proved theorem  [ maintheorem ] using oriented matroid theory and a computer program as well .",
    "the proof we present here uses basic oriented matroid theory ; however , it does not rely on any computer program .",
    "we have chosen to study the graph @xmath10 since it belongs to the petersen graph family , i.e. , the seven graphs constituting the set of all minor minimal intrinsically linked graphs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3 and @xmath10 together are necessary and sufficient for generating the entire petersen graph family using triangle - y moves @xcite .",
    "if the effect of triangle - y moves on the number of links in a linearly embedded graph has a `` nice '' characterization , it , together with our knowing the number of links in @xmath3 and @xmath10 , might provide a quick way of finding the number of links in linear embeddings of the remaining petersen family graphs .",

    "it remains to show no embedding of @xmath0 can contain more than five nontrivial links .",
    "given a linear embedding of @xmath10 , let @xmath324 denote the projection of its @xmath23 subgraph onto a small 2sphere centered at vertex  7 .",
