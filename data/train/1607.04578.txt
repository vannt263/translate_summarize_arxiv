    "measurements on separated subsystems in a joint entangled state may display correlations that can not be mimicked by local hidden variable models .",
    "these correlations are known as nonlocal , and they are detected by violating the so - called bell inequalities @xcite . in recent years , however , it has been become clear that non - locality is interesting not only for fundamental reasons , but also as a resource for many device - independent ( di ) quantum information tasks @xcite , such as quantum key distribution @xcite or random number generation @xcite . from this new point of view , the violations of bell inequalities are not merely indicators of non - locality , but can be used to infer qualitative and quantitative statements about different operationally relevant quantum properties .",
    "traditionally , the construction of bell inequalities has been addressed from the point of view of deriving constraints satisfied by local models . following this standard approach ,",
    "the inequalities are constructed using well - known techniques in convex geometry .",
    "indeed , the set of correlations admitting a local hidden variable model corresponds to a polytope @xcite , that is , a convex set with a finite number of extreme points or vertices .",
    "these vertices are known and correspond to local deterministic assignments , while the ( in general ) unknown facets are the desired bell inequalities .",
    "such  facet bell inequalities \" form a complete set of bell inequalities , in the sense that they provide necessary and sufficient criteria to detect the non - locality of given correlations .",
    "clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh )  @xcite and collins - gisin - linden - massar - popescu ( cglmp )  @xcite inequalities are examples of tight inequalities .",
    "if such facet bell inequalities are optimal detectors of non - locality , they are , however , not necessarily optimal for inferring specific quantum properties in the device - independent setting .",
    "for instance , in a scenario where two binary measurements are performed on two entangled subsystems , it is well known that the violation of the chsh inequality @xcite is a necessary and sufficient condition for non - locality .",
    "but certain  non - facet \" bell inequalities are better certificates of quantum randomness than the chsh inequality when the two quantum systems are partially entangled @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the problem of constructing bell inequalities whose maximal quantum violation , usually referred to as the _ tsirelson bound _",
    "@xcite , is attained for maximally entangled states of two qudits .",
    "this is a desirable property since such states have particular features , such as perfect correlations between outcomes of local measurements in the same bases , and therefore many quantum information protocols rely on them .",
    "the main aim of this work is to introduce a family of bell inequalities with an arbitrary number of measurements and outcomes which are maximally violated by the maximally entangled pair of two qudits .",
    "crucially , their maximal quantum violation can be computed _",
    "analytically_.    in the case where only two measurements are made on each subsystem , all facet bell inequalities are known for a small number of outputs and they are all of the cglmp form @xcite .",
    "however , the cglmp inequalities are not maximally violated by the maximally entangled states of two qudits ( except in the case @xmath0 corresponding to the chsh inequality ) @xcite .",
    "we should therefore not expect a priori our inequalities to be facet inequalities , and indeed they are not .",
    "the fact that our inequalities will not necessarily be facet inequalities also implies that we can not use standard tools based on convex geometry and polytopes to construct them .",
    "in fact , no quantum property is used for the construction of tight bell inequalities like cglmp and , in this sense , it may not be that surprising that their maximal violation does not require maximal entanglement .",
    "our approach is completely different : it starts instead from quantum theory and exploits the symmetries and perfect correlations of maximally entangled states to derive a bell inequality .",
    "it is also closely linked to sum of squares decompositions of the bell operator , which can be used to determine their tsirelson bound .",
    "thus , quantum theory becomes a key ingredient of our method for generating new bell inequalities .",
    "our results have the potential to be used in di quantum information protocols .",
    "the inequalities are good candidates for improved di random number generation or quantum key distribution protocols or to self - test @xcite maximally entangled states of high dimension .",
    "interestingly , they also give further insight into the structure of the set of quantum correlations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secprelim ] , we review the necessary framework to state our results . in section [ secclass ]",
    "we introduce our bell inequalities and their derivation , while in section [ secproperties ] we study their properties and give their tsirelson bound . in sections [ secappli ] and [ secdiscuss ] , we briefly discuss their possible application to di protocols and the interest of our findings .",
    "throughout this work , we consider a bipartite bell scenario in which two distant parties @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( often taking the placeholder names _ alice _ and _ bob _ ) perform measurements on their share of some physical system .",
    "we suppose that they have @xmath3 possible measurement choices ( or inputs ) at their disposal and that each measurement has @xmath4 possible outcomes ( or outputs ) .",
    "we denote this scenario @xmath5 .",
    "we label their inputs and outputs as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the correlations that can be obtained in such a bell experiment are described by a set of @xmath8 joint probabilities @xmath9 that alice and bob obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11 upon performing the @xmath12th and @xmath13th measurement , respectively . these probabilities can be given a geometric representation by ordering them into a vector @xmath14    importantly , the set of allowed @xmath15 can vary , depending on the physical principles the probabilities @xmath9 obey .",
    "thus , to every physical theory , one can assign a set of correlations in @xmath16 .",
    "if the measurements correspond to spacelike separated events , the observed correlations should obey the _ no - signalling principle _ , which prevents any faster - than - light communication among the parties .",
    "these correlations form a convex set that is a polytope , which we denote by @xmath17 .",
    "contained in this set is the set of quantum correlations , denoted @xmath18 , which corresponds to those @xmath15 whose components can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is some state in a tensor product hilbert space @xmath21 whose dimension is unconstrained , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are projection operators defining , respectively , the measurement @xmath12 on alice s system and the measurement @xmath13 on bob s system .",
    "finally , the set of correlations admitting local hidden variable models , termed also _ local _ or _ classical _ , corresponds to those @xmath15 that can be written as a convex sum of product deterministic correlations of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote alice s and bob s predetermined outputs for inputs @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "bell was the first to prove that not all quantum correlations admit a local hidden variable model @xcite .",
    "to this end , he used the concept of a bell inequality @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the so - called bell expression that , most generally , is a linear combination of the @xmath8 joint probabilities of the form @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the local ( or classical ) bound of the bell inequality and it is the maximum value @xmath31 that @xmath28 can achieve on product deterministic correlations @xcite .",
    "the quantum or tsirelson bound of the bell expression is the maximum value @xmath32 that it can achieve for quantum correlations .",
    "such a bell expression corresponds to a proper bell inequality ",
    "one that can be violated by quantum theory  if @xmath33 .",
    "let us finally define @xmath34 to be the maximal value of @xmath28 over all no - signalling correlations .",
    "it turns out that for most bell inequalities the chain of inequalities @xmath35 holds true @xcite .",
    "the set of local correlations is a polytope which is defined through bell inequalities .",
    "hence , if @xmath15 violates a bell inequality , the correlations described by @xmath15 are nonlocal .",
    "the set @xmath18 , on the other hand , is not a polytope , yet it is convex .",
    "there have been several attempts to characterize it from an operational point of view @xcite , but an operational characterization remains to be found @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle is the current lack of mathematical understanding of the structure of the set of quantum correlations .",
    "this makes the derivation of tsirelson bounds a difficult problem .",
    "indeed , given an arbitrary bell inequality , there is no procedure that guarantees finding its tsirelson bound , and it was achieved analytically only in a handful of cases .",
    "there is however a practical approximation scheme introduced in @xcite based on a semidefinite programming , which consists in a hierarchy of sets @xmath36 converging to @xmath18 as @xmath37 .",
    "the sets @xmath38 are the feasible regions of semi - definite programs , which are efficiently solvable .",
    "although this method yields in practice very good upper numerical bounds ( often tight ones ) on the maximal violations of bell inequalities for small bell scenarios , it is limited by the fact that it becomes computationally expensive for larger scenarios and for high @xmath39 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our aim is to introduce a family of bell expressions , whose maximal quantum value is attained by the maximally entangled states of two qudits @xmath40 . to derive these bell expressions",
    ", we start from the premise that their maximal quantum values are obtained when alice and bob perform the optimal cglmp measurements introduced in @xcite for the case @xmath41 and generalized to more inputs in @xcite .",
    "the reason for this choice is that these measurements simply generalize the chsh measurements ( @xmath0 ) to the case @xmath42 and that they lead to non - local correlations that are the most robust to noise  @xcite or give a stronger statistical test  @xcite ( at least in the case @xmath41 ) .",
    "these measurements are presented in detail in appendix  [ appendixmeasurements ] .    note that this choice of measurements is arbitrary and only used as a starting point to determine the bell expressions that we are looking for .",
    "but once we have determined them , we will no longer make any assumptions on the particular measurements that alice and bob perform , in particular , when we derive formally their quantum bounds .",
    "the probabilities @xmath9 obtained when using the optimal cglmp measurements on @xmath43 have several symmetries , detailed in appendix [ appendixmeasurements ] .",
    "for instance , they only depend on the difference @xmath44 .",
    "if we impose that our bell expressions respect this particular symmetry , the probabilities @xmath45 should be treated equally for all @xmath46 . in other words , the bell expressions",
    "should be written as linear combinations of @xmath47 .",
    "taking into account the other symmetries ( see appendix  [ appendixmeasurements ] ) , a generic form for our bell expressions is @xmath48 where @xmath49\\ ] ] and @xmath50,\\ ] ] and where we define that @xmath51 .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the only degrees of freedom left and we fix them such that the resulting bell inequalities are indeed maximally violated by the state @xmath43 .",
    "note that taking @xmath54 for @xmath41 , one recovers the cglmp bell inequalities .    to exploit the symmetries inherent in bell inequalities ,",
    "we often write them in terms of correlators instead of probabilities . for",
    "two - output measurements one can switch from correlators to probabilities by means of an invertible transformation , but for @xmath42 it becomes necessary to appeal to the notion of generalized correlators .",
    "these are in general complex numbers that are defined through the two - dimensional discrete fourier transform of the probabilities @xmath9 , that is , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be thought of as measurements whose outcomes are labelled by roots of unity @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "for quantum correlations these numbers can be expressed in terms of the born s rule . indeed , assuming correlations @xmath15 to be quantum and given by eq .",
    "( [ quantum ] ) , we can interpret @xmath62 as the average value of the tensor product of the following operators @xmath63 in the state @xmath64 .",
    "thus , in what follows , whenever we work with quantum correlations we have the above representation in mind .",
    "note the operators in eq .",
    "( [ operators ] ) are unitary , their eigenvalues are the roots of unity , and they enjoy properties such as @xmath65 and @xmath66 for any @xmath67 .",
    "exploiting now transformation ( [ correlators ] ) , expression ( [ bellproba ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath68 where , for clarity , the change of variables @xmath69 with @xmath70 was introduced on bob s side .",
    "note that due to the convention @xmath71 , the term @xmath72 is defined in a slightly different manner as @xmath73 . for simplicity , we ignored an irrelevant scalar term in ( [ bellcorr ] ) and rescaled the expression . to recover @xmath74 exactly from @xmath75 , one has to add that scalar term corresponding to @xmath76 , and divide the expression by @xmath4 .",
    "each choice for the free parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 now corresponds to a choice for the variables @xmath77 .",
    "as explained above , our aim is to fix their value according to the quantum property we need : maximal violation by the maximally entangled state @xmath78 . at this point , it is instructive to look at the specific example of the chsh bell expression ( @xmath41 , @xmath0 ) . in the notation ( [ bellcorr ] ) , we write the chsh bell expression @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "notice now that for the optimal measurements leading to the quantum bound of the chsh inequality , we have that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "our intuition is to fix this condition generically for any @xmath3 and @xmath4 : we choose the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that the conditions @xmath85 hold for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in the case that the initial operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the optimal cglmp operators .",
    "further intuition for imposing these exact conditions will be provided in the next section , where we prove the tsirelson bound of the expressions .    conditions ( [ conditions ] ) give rise to a set of linear equations for the variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 which is solved in detail in appendix  [ appendixcoefficients ] , giving @xmath88\\ ] ] @xmath89\\ ] ] with @xmath90 .    to sum up",
    ", our class of bell expressions is given by @xmath74 ( [ bellproba ] ) or equivalently by @xmath75 ( [ bellcorr ] ) , with coefficients ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "we arrived at this class of bell expressions by first writing the most general bell expression satisfying the symmetry of cglmp correlations , then re - writing these bell expressions in the simple form ( [ bellcorr ] ) through a change of variable on bob s side , and then imposing the conditions ( [ conditions ] ) that generalize a property observed in the chsh case .",
    "so far we can not guarantee that these bell expressions lead to proper bell inequalities violated by quantum theory , nor that their quantum bound is attained by the maximally entangled state @xmath78 , but we show in the next section that this is indeed the case .",
    "we now present our main results for the class of bell expressions ( [ bellcorr ] ) .",
    "all the values for the bounds of ( [ bellproba ] ) can be obtained directly from those of ( [ bellcorr ] ) as mentioned in appendix  [ appendixcoefficients ] .",

    "it turns out that the maximizing strategy is to have @xmath95 terms equal to 1 multiplied by @xmath96 and @xmath92 term equal to 1 multiplied by @xmath97 .",
    "all other terms must be equal to 0 .",
    "more details can be found in appendix [ appendixclassical ] .",
    "importantly , the resulting bell inequality @xmath98 is violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , we can reach the value @xmath99 for @xmath75 by applying the cglmp measurements on the maximally entangled state .",
    "this is easily seen using eq .",
    "( [ conditions ] ) , the unitarity of @xmath100 , and the following property of the maximally entangled states : @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath103 operators .",
    "one can see how all the correlators in ( [ bellcorr ] ) are then equal to 1 , yielding the quantum violation of @xmath99 after summing over @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "crucially , as we prove below , the value @xmath99 turns out to be the maximal quantum violation of our bell inequalities .",
    "[ theoquantum ] the tsirelson bound of @xmath75 is given by @xmath106 .",
    "here we present a sketch of the proof , while its more detailed version is deferred to appendix [ appendixtsirelson ] .",
    "the idea of the proof is to construct a sum - of - squares ( sos ) decomposition of the shifted bell operator @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the identity operator and @xmath109 the bell operator corresponding to expression ( [ bellcorr ] ) , as was done for instance in @xcite . for any positive semidefinite operator @xmath110 ,",
    "an sos decomposition is a finite collection of operators @xmath111 such that @xmath112 it is clear that if the shifted bell operator @xmath113 can be written as ( [ sostheo ] ) it must be semidefinite positive , which proves that @xmath114 is an upper bound to our bell expression .",
    "indeed , for any quantum state @xmath115 , it then holds that @xmath116 , which implies for the bell operator that @xmath117 .",
    "this approach is in principle valid for any shifted bell operator , thus for any bell expression . as we expect the @xmath118 s to be polynomials of the measurement operators of alice and bob",
    ", we can define the order of the sos decomposition as the largest degree of these polynomials .    in our case",
    ", we show that @xmath106 is indeed the maximal quantum violation of our class of bell inequalities as the shifted bell operator @xmath119 can be decomposed as @xmath120 where @xmath121 , and @xmath122 with @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "our bell operator is @xmath126 , and the decomposition is independent of the choice of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the second sum of terms with coefficients @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath129 was added to compensate some non - vanishing terms in the first sum .",
    "the exact values of the coefficients along with details on the sos decomposition can be found in appendix  [ appendixtsirelson ] .",
    "let us elaborate on how the sos works in the case @xmath41 , which justifies _ a posteriori _ the imposition of conditions ( [ conditions ] ) . for @xmath41 , only the first part of the sos decomposition remains .",
    "at the point of maximal violation , both sides of ( [ sos ] ) applied on @xmath130 must yield @xmath93 . since the measurements are now the optimal cglmp ones , eq .",
    "( [ conditions ] ) holds , and can be used as above with the property @xmath131 to see easily how the first sum of the decomposition cancels .",
    "one can now grasp the intuition behind conditions ( [ conditions ] ) : imposing them leads to having an sos of the form ( [ sos ] ) , more precisely an sos of order one in the operators @xmath100 and @xmath132 .    in the chsh case",
    ", one can observe the same effect , as these same properties of the optimal state and measurements allow the bell operator @xmath133 to have the following sos decomposition , which is also of order one : @xmath134 with @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "thus , our construction generalizes this quantum aspect of chsh . in the case",
    "@xmath137 , the sos does not generalize as directly , and one has to add `` by hand '' the extra terms @xmath138 .",
    "however , the order of the sos remains one .",
    "[ theons ] the no - signalling bound of @xmath75 is given by @xmath139    in appendix  [ appendixns ] , we provide a no - signalling behaviour and show that it attains the algebraic bound of our bell expressions .",
    "it corresponds to having all the probabilities which are multiplied by @xmath96 in @xmath74 equal to 1 , and all the others equal to 0 .    for our expressions to form a non - trivial bell inequalities ,",
    "the classical bound must be smaller than the quantum one for all @xmath140 .",
    "we show this in appendix  [ appendixscalings ] , and we also study the scaling of the classical , quantum , and no - signalling bounds .    finally , note that for @xmath41 , our bell expressions coincide with those introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and then rederived in @xcite using a different approach .",
    "moreover , the maximal quantum violations of these bell inequalities was computed in refs .",
    "@xcite exploiting alternative techniques . on the other hand , for @xmath0 and any @xmath3 , our class recovers",
    "the well - known chained bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "a natural application for our expressions is self - testing , a di protocol in which a state and measurements performed on it are certified up to local isometries , based on the nonlocal correlations they produce  here , on the violation of a bell inequality . to perform self - testing ,",
    "the point of maximal violation must be unique , which is a property that we have not proven for our inequalities .",
    "there exists a numerical method for self - testing called the swap method @xcite , and we applied it to the simplest case @xmath41 and @xmath141 .",
    "the results of the program are plotted in figure [ swap3 ] .",
    "it shows that , in this scenario , the maximal violation is unique and self - testing the maximally entangled state of two qutrits @xmath142 is possible , with robustness .",
    "an open question consists in generalizing these self - testing results to any dimension , which must be done analytically .",
    "our inequalities could then find a direct application in di random number generation protocols @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if the point of maximal violation is proven to be unique , one can successfully apply the method of @xcite and use the symmetries of the bell expressions to guarantee a dit of randomness when observing the maximal violation .",
    "ultimately , by increasing the dimension @xmath4 , one would achieve unbounded randomness expansion .",
    "our inequalities could also find applications in di quantum key distribution .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite through the example of the cglmp inequalities that exploiting high dimensional systems can be beneficial in noisy scenarios .",
    "an advantage that our inequalities have over cglmp in that scenario is that the maximally entangled state can produce perfect correlations between the users , which should lead to higher key generation rates than using the cglmp inequalities .    .",
    "at the maximal violation @xmath143 , the fidelity is equal to @xmath92 , meaning that the quantum state used in the bell experiment must be equal to the reference state . for lower violations ,",
    "the fidelity decreases .",
    "[ swap3],scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "in summary , we have introduced a new technique allowing to construct bell inequalities with an arbitrary number of measurements and outcomes that are maximally violated by the maximally entangled states .",
    "it exploits the concept of sos decompositions of bell operators and , crucially , allows one to compute analytically their tsirelson bounds .",
    "we also provide the classical and no - signalling bounds of the resulting bell inequalities .",
    "our results are very general as , unlike previous works , we do not consider a particular bell scenario , but allow the number of inputs @xmath3 and outputs @xmath4 to be arbitrary .",
    "our inequalities can be seen as the `` quantum '' or the di - oriented generalization of chsh bell inequality in the same spirit as the cglmp inequality generalizes the chsh one classically . indeed ,",
    "while the cglmp inequalities preserve the property of being facets of the local polytope , our inequalities possess the same sum - of - squares structure as chsh at the maximal quantum violation , which leads to the important property for di protocols of being maximally violated by the maximal entangled state .",
    "moreover , let us note that deriving tsirelson bounds allows us to gain insight about the quantum set of correlations  more specifically its boundary  and has thus fundamental implications .",
    "in particular , a feature of our class of inequalities worth highlighting is that their tsirelson bound corresponds to the bound obtained using the npa hierarchy at the first level , i.e. , within the set @xmath144 .",
    "this is a rare property , which to our knowledge has been previously observed only for xor games . that the tsirelson bounds of our inequalities are attained in @xmath144 follows from our sos decomposition ( see eq .",
    "( [ sos ] ) ) .",
    "indeed the degree of an optimal sos decomposition for a bell operator is directly linked to the level of the npa hierarchy at which the quantum bound is obtained @xcite .",
    "an sos of degree 1 , as in our case , corresponds to the first level @xmath145 .",
    "this means that the boundaries of the sets @xmath18 and @xmath146 intersect on the point of maximal violation of our inequalities .",
    "this observation , in conjunction with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , raises a question about @xmath146 .",
    "indeed , the boundaries of @xmath18 and @xmath146 seems to intersect at points that correspond to the maximal violation of bell inequalities attained by maximally entangled states .",
    "one should confirm whether this trend is a general property , and could perhaps use it as a way to characterize @xmath146 .",

    ", we present in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] the numerical values of these ratios for low values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .        we prove that @xmath383 , which is equivalent to ( [ lemmaclasseq ] ) since both bounds are larger than @xmath93 .",
    "this inequality can be written as : @xmath384 if we define @xmath385 and @xmath386 , it becomes : @xmath387 for @xmath388 and @xmath389 . since the first term is positive for these intervals , it suffices to show that @xmath390 clearly , @xmath391 .",
    "this minimum corresponds to the limit @xmath392 , since the derivative @xmath393 of @xmath394 with respect to @xmath10 is strictly positive on the considered intervals of @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",

    "( [ cidra ] ) is strictly positive within the above intervals .",
    "now , computing the limit of @xmath394 when @xmath392 , one obtains @xmath401 it can be verified straightforwardly that this expression is strictly positive in the interval @xmath389 , by comparing the two functions @xmath402 and @xmath403 , and noticing that the former upper bounds the latter in the interval @xmath389 . indeed , at @xmath404 , we have that @xmath405 , and in this interval , both their derivatives are negative , with the derivative of the first function smaller than the derivative of the second one .",
