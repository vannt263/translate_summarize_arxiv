    "the inclusion of the strutinsky s shell correction @xcite-@xcite in the liquid- drop model @xcite , namely the so - called macroscopic - microscopic method , has allowed considerable improvements in the predictions of the nuclear masses @xcite , and in the calculations of the fission barriers , as well @xcite,@xcite . nowadays , despite the progress of the more basic microscopic models ( such as self - consistent models ) , it remains often used .",
    "this method consists essentially of combining the liquid - drop model ( macroscopic model ) where the binding energy varies slowly as a function of the number of nucleons @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with a shell correction varying abruptly with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is due to the non - uniformity of the shell structure of the energy levels .",
    "it is extracted from a single - particle hamiltonian ( microscopic model ) according to an original idea of strutinsky .",
    "the strutinsky method is mainly based on a particular smoothing procedure of the density of states .",
    "although this method is very efficient , it contains two weak points which are :    \\1 ) the dependence of the results on the two well known inherent parameters , i.e. the width @xmath2 and the order @xmath3 of the smoothing    \\2 ) the difficulties of the treatment of the continuum encountered with realistic mean potentials    the purpose of the present work is summarized in the following points :    \\1 ) the strutinsky method can be derived rigorously from the point of view of the least - squares approximation _ _  _ _ of the level density .",
    "the equivalence between this point of view and the well - known standard averaging appears trivial .",
    "\\2 ) in this work , it is proved analytically that the averaged level density obtained by the strutinsky method is simply an approximation to the semiclassical level density.in this respect , the semiclassical level density can be considered as the `` true '' ( i.e. exact ) smooth density .",
    "\\3 ) it is mainly shown that in comparison with the semiclassical method , the strutinsky method is characterized by a remainder which contains all the dependence on the two smoothing ( free ) parameters , and which is thence , the source of the `` noise '' of the averaging procedure .",
    "\\4 ) concerning the smooth density of states and the smooth energy , it is demonstrated that the strutinsky method is reliable .",
    "however , the shell correction itself must be treated with care because it is very sensitive to the choice of the two free averaging parameters . in this context , in order to improve the method , we propose the `` rule of the relative remainder '' ( rrr rule ) .",
    "\\5 ) at last , it is explained why the strutinsky method fails near the zero - energy ( top of the well ) for finite mean potentials",
    "in spite of the complexity of the nuclear forces , it appears that most of the binding energy of the nuclei is well described by the so - called liquid - drop model .",
    "this simple phenomenological approach is of a classical type .",
    "this means that the quantum effects , or a more precisely , the shell effects , are ignored by this model .",
    "this causes systematic discrepancies between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data on the other hand , it is known that such effects are contained in the shell model , but the latter is unable to reproduce correctly the general trends of the binding energy . to solve this dilemma ,",
    "strutinsky has proposed to combine the binding energy of the liquid - drop model with a small ( but essential ) correction deduced from the shell model .",
    "this can be written as :    @xmath4    the shell correction is calculated from a mathematical prescription outlined by strutinsky    it is obtained by summing the single particle energies of a phenomenological shell model potential and subtracting the average ( smooth ) part of this quantity :    @xmath5    as already mentioned , this method is often called the macroscopic - microscopic method because it mixes two very different models .",
    "such a duality is obviously not free from inconsistency .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to give a microscopic basis to this `` model '' within the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation and some simple assumptions @xcite,@xcite.this consists essentially of expanding the hf energy around its semiclassical approximation obtaining thus the so - called `` strutinsky energy theorem '' :    @xmath6    here @xmath7 is the hf density matrix , and @xmath8 its semiclassical approximation which is a smooth quantity , free of shell effects .",
    "for this reason @xmath8 can be assimilated to the classical average ( i.e. without quantal variations ) part of @xmath7 .",
    "the sums of single - particle energies @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related respectively to @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "finally , @xmath11 is a quantity of the second order in the operator @xmath12 , and is generally negligible ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from ( [ 591 ] ) that the macroscopic - microscopic method described above is a `` schematic '' interpretation of this theorem .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 can be replaced by the energy of the liquid - drop formula , and the shell correction is deduced from a phenomenological one body hamiltonian it is also to be noted that a complete microscopic approach of this theorem remains possible .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors use a method referred to as the extended thomas fermi plus strutinsky integral ( etfsi ) method . in the latter , the semiclassical quantity @xmath13 is deduced self - consistently from a microscopic effective interaction.(skyrme iii ) . the shell correction",
    "is then added to @xmath14 .    in the following ,",
    "we will mainly focus on two points :    * the mathematical aspect of the strutinsky smoothing * the link between this smoothing and the semiclassical approximation , and its consequences      the strutinsky averaging can be derived by various formal approaches @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite.in this work , we will derive it from the point of view of the least - squares approximation .",
    "in fact , this point has been early suggested by bunatian and co - authors @xcite . the least - squares approximation will help us to understand why the strutinsky averaging fails near the edge of realistic potentials.@xmath15for an entirely discrete spectrum the level density of states",
    "is defined by :    @xmath16    in the following , this density will be called the `` exact quantum level density '' , or shortly , the `` exact level density '' , because it is a true quantum quantity , as opposed to its semiclassical approximation , or as opposed to the level density obtained from @xmath17 by the strutinsky averaging ( see below ) .    in fact , eq.([1 ] ) concerns uniquely infinite potentials without continuum .",
    "finite potentials will be treated separately at the end of this paper .",
    "let @xmath18 be a polynomial approximation of order @xmath3 to the `` exact '' level density .",
    "more precisely , we seek this approximation in the vicinity of a point @xmath19 ( which represents actually the fermi level ) in an effective interval @xmath20 $ ] , by using the gaussian weight @xmath21 . for this reason ,",
    "the cited polynomial must depend a priori not only on @xmath3 , but also on @xmath2 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , it will be denoted @xmath22 . for our purpose",
    ", it will be convenient to write this polynomial as a linear combination of hermite polynomials @xmath23.@xmath24    thus , we must look for the polynomial @xmath25 which minimizes the integral :    @xmath26 ^{2}e^{-\\left (   \\dfrac{\\epsilon-\\lambda}{\\gamma}\\right ) ^{2}}d\\epsilon   \\label{2}\\ ] ]    this procedure is a local averaging in the sense of the least- squares fit . minimizing ( [ 2 ] ) with respect to the coefficients @xmath27 , and using the orthogonality property of the hermite polynomials we find :    @xmath28 ,   \\notag \\\\ u_{n}=\\dfrac{\\epsilon _ { n}-\\lambda } { \\gamma }   \\notag\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    as we shall see in the next subsection , eq.([33 ] ) is not the final definition of the averaging which thus appears somewhat more `` subtle '' .      in eq.([33 ] ) the fermi level @xmath29 is supposed to be fixed , and the polynomial @xmath30 smoothes the exact level density only in the vicinity of @xmath29 .",
    "thus only a part of the spectrum is `` smoothed '' , i.e. the part @xmath31 . to avoid this drawback ,",
    "it is necessary to consider @xmath29 as a variable .",
    "the averaged level density is thus defined as @xmath32 making @xmath33 .",
    "this amounts to perform a moving average ( i.e. @xmath29 is moved with @xmath34 , `` centering '' @xmath34 on @xmath29).in the following , we shall call up the function @xmath35 as the strutinsky s level density , and we will note it simply by @xmath36.since the coefficients @xmath37 in ( [ 33 ] ) depend on @xmath29 , the strutinsky s quantity @xmath38 is , in general , not a polynomial in @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is clear that , although the strutinsky level density is not really a polynomial , it behaves locally ( @xmath39 , like a least deviating polynomial approximation for the exact level density @xmath40  given by ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "explicitly , we must replace @xmath34 with @xmath29 in ( [ 33 ] ) :    @xmath41    in ( [ 4 ] ) the polynomial @xmath42 constitutes the so - called curvature correction term .",
    "it is easy to check that the expression ( [ 4 ] ) obtained from a least - squares fitting , can be written as the usual folding procedure of the exact level density @xcite,@xcite :    @xmath43    which demonstrates the equivalence between the two points of view , i.e. between the local least square smoothing ( [ 2 ] ) and the averaging ( 400 ) .",
    "remark : it is to be noted that if @xmath3 increases to infinity and/or @xmath44 decreases to zero , then @xmath45 tends toward @xmath46 .",
    "obviously , in practice these parameters are finite .",
    "the least - square smoothing ( [ 2 ] ) or its equivalent ( [ 400 ] ) gives an approximation _ to the exact level density _ ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the averaging is too accurate ( see the previous remark ) the procedure leads to a curve which is very close to ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this curve remains characterized by strong oscillations which express shell effects .",
    "however , the aim of the strutinsky method is precisely to remove these shell effects .    for @xmath47 ,",
    "the effective interval of averaging is governed by a pure gaussian ( since @xmath48 in ( [ 4 ] ) ) . in order to wipe out the shell effects from the averaging",
    ", the parameter @xmath2 must be at least of the order of the mean spacing between the shells.(denoted here by @xmath49 ) near the fermi level : @xmath50 in this way , we obtain a `` true '' smooth density .",
    "if eq.([7 ] ) is not satisfied , the level density remains characterized by oscillations ( quantum effects ) and are in opposition with the character of the semiclassical density .    for @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath52 is not a pure gaussian anymore , and , this case becomes more complicated .",
    "indeed , the width of the averaging function @xmath52 is not really @xmath2 , because in ( [ 4 ] ) the gaussian is modulated by the polynomial @xmath53it turns out that to maintain this width of the order of mean spacing shell we have to enlarge the parameter @xmath2 with respect to the order @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the smoothing procedure implies a `` coherency '' between these two parameters .",
    "usually , the couple ( @xmath54 ) is determined by the so - called plateau condition @xcite from the typical ranges : @xmath55 and , @xmath56 .    due to the above `` coherency ''",
    ", it is easy to notice that the plateau is invariably moved towards the right - hand side ( toward the largest @xmath57 , when @xmath3 increases .    since in the harmonic oscillator",
    "the spacing between the shells is constant , we have in this simple case @xmath58 .",
    "fig.1 displays the strutinsky level density ( calculated from rel.([4 ] ) ) for three values of the parameter @xmath2.(@xmath3 being fixed )",
    ".    curve ( a ) : since @xmath2 is too small compared to @xmath59 the curve ( a ) is characterized by strong oscillations ( shell effects ) which are close to dirac functions ( see rel.([1])).curve ( b ) : by increasing @xmath2 one diminishes the magnitude of these oscillations.curve ( c ) : in the third case , @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath59 , the curve becomes smooth , and can be regarded as the mean behavior of the exact level density ( the so - called smooth component contained in the exact level density ( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the averaged particle - number and the averaged energy are defined through the average density of states @xmath60 by :    @xmath61    the detailed expressions are given in ref.@xcite .    in practice the upper bound of the integral giving the particle - number is deduced from the equation    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the particle - number of the system .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is the fermi level of the average density @xmath60 ( i.e. the strutinsky level density )    finally the strutinsky shell correction to the binding energy of the liquid drop model is defined as follows :    @xmath64    where @xmath17 is the exact level density given by ( [ 1 ] ) and @xmath65 is its fermi level ( the last occupied level ) .",
    "sometimes , @xmath66 is denoted as @xmath67 .    in rel.([48 ] ) , the shell correction should not contain any component of the smooth energy which is by definition already included in the liquid drop model .",
    "consequently , the average density @xmath60 ( or the average energy @xmath68 ) must not contain any residual shell effect.moreover , since @xmath60is a least square approximation of @xmath69 , one can write @xmath70 , with @xmath71 .",
    "when the condition ( [ 7 ] ) is fulfilled , @xmath72 becomes smooth and the exact density @xmath73 oscillates around @xmath74 making @xmath75 alternatively positive and negative .",
    "consequently , from ( [ 48 ] ) one can deduce formally that :    @xmath76    thus , the oscillations of the shell correction @xmath77 as a function of @xmath29 are due to the fluctuations of @xmath78 .",
    "note : in practice , due to the finite size of the spectrum , for the shell correction , the following cut - off condition @xmath79 must be required ( see @xcite )",
    "although the strutinsky level density is mathematically well defined by ( 4 ) , there is no physical basis for this smoothing .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to build an other level density free of shell effects which would be justified by physical arguments .",
    "shell effects are the consequence of the quantum nature of the level distribution ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the natural way to eliminate such effects would be to go over to the classical limit .",
    "to this end , we will apply the correspondence principle ( bohr 1923 ) which states that the behavior of quantum systems reduces to classical physics in `` the limit of large quantum numbers''.starting from this principle , the semiclassical level density can be deduced by using the euler - maclaurin ( eml ) summation formula.in practice , this amounts to obtain an asymptotic series which contains only three or four terms , all the others being divergent .",
    "the first term of this series coincides with the known thomas - fermi approximation.the eml expansion used here is equivalent to the usual standard semiclassical methods , e.g. , the wigner - kirkwood expansion @xcite,14,@xcite , or the method of the partition function @xcite .",
    "the latter are based on asymptotic series of powers of @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , in the correspondence principle , the limit of large quantum numbers amounts to taking the classical limit @xmath81 .      in practical cases",
    ", the concept of `` large quantum numbers '' must be prcised by a more concrete definition . to illustrate this point",
    ", we start from the typical example of the three - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "such system is very simple , its energy levels are given by :    @xmath82 ,",
    "@xmath83 @xmath84    the quantum number @xmath85 defines a shell , and @xmath86 represents the gap between these shells .",
    "thus , @xmath85 is given by :    @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the lowest level of the spectrum    the correspondence principle states that for large values of @xmath89 , the quantum physics reduces to classical physics , in particular , the quantum ( exact ) level density @xmath90 defined by ( [ 1 ] ) should approach the semiclassical level density denoted here by @xmath91 .",
    "this can be written as : if @xmath92 \\rightarrow\\infty$ ] , @xmath93then @xmath94    as already noted , the shell effects are mainly determined by the small part of the spectrum @xmath95 which is located in the vicinity of the fermi level @xmath29 .",
    "consequently for these levels , we have roughly @xmath96 , and , this limit becomes : if @xmath97 \\rightarrow\\infty,\\ \\ \\ \\ $ ] then@xmath98    since in general the fermi level increases with the quantum numbers , the arguments presented for the harmonic oscillator are also valid for any other physical system . therefore , we will consider the previous statement as general .",
    "however , we must now redefine @xmath59 _ _  _ _ as the mean shell - spacing in the neighborhood of the fermi level _ _  _ _ @xmath19 .",
    "as in rel.([7 ] ) , we denote it by @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100    this limit is of course unphysical .",
    "therefore in practice , we require the following qualitative criterion :    @xmath101    we understand by ( [ 55 ] ) that @xmath102 $ ] is sufficiently large compared to the unity so that @xmath40 can be considered as close as possible to @xmath103 with a `` satisfactory accuracy '' .    finally , the `` asymptotic limit of large quantum numbers '' can be defined theoretically by ( [ 4796 ] ) , or practically by ( [ 55 ] ) .",
    "notes : in practical cases , @xmath104 , therefore the previous requirement can be replaced with @xmath105 . in this case , the fermi level @xmath29 must be measured from the bottom of the well      the procedure described above is applied in appendix b to two simple cases .",
    "the eigenenergies of the isotropic oscillator are : @xmath106    the semiclassical level density of the harmonic oscillator is a simple parabola ( see appendix b ) :    @xmath107    this result is well - known , and was established very early by means of the partition function @xcite , or more recently by the wigner - kirkwood expansion  @xcite .      for the case of cubic box with totally reflecting walls the spectrum is given by :    @xmath108    the semiclassical level density of the infinite cubic box ( see appendix b ) is also an `` old '' result @xcite , @xcite .    @xmath109      we define the semiclassical energy by a very similar relations to ( [ 10]-[48 ] ) , replacing the strutinsky level density by the one of the semiclassical density . the corresponding fermi level is denoted as @xmath110.@xmath111    @xmath112    @xmath113    one must note that unlike @xmath114 , the quantity @xmath115 does not depend on any free parameter .",
    "we know from the bohr principle given in subsect . [ 687 ] that in the `` asymptotic limit '' ( [ 55 ] ) we must have the approximation @xmath116 . since the strutinsky averaging ( [ 400 ] ) gives an approximation to the exact level density @xmath117 , normally in this limit it should also give an approximation to the semiclassical level density @xmath118",
    ". the role of the curvature correction term would be to improve the approximation .",
    "we start from the averaging ( [ 400 ] ) , substituting @xmath91 for @xmath90 in the `` asymptotic limit''([55 ] ) . in the strutinsky",
    "averaging the parameter @xmath44 must be of the order of the mean shell spacing @xmath119 near the fermi level ( see eq.([7 ] ) ) .",
    "consequently , in rel.([55 ] )  we should replace @xmath119 with @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath120    making @xmath121 , we obtain :    @xmath122  @xmath3 even    now , one replaces the semiclassical density @xmath123 by its @xmath124 first terms of the taylor expansion around @xmath125  ( @xmath3 must be even in @xmath126 ) .",
    "the last term gives an estimation of the remainder :    @xmath127\\widetilde{p}_{m}\\left ( x\\right ) \\exp \\left ( -x^{2}\\right ) dx\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    it is easy to show that @xmath128 behaves like a delta function with respect to any polynomial of order @xmath129 .",
    "consequently the first term gives back @xmath118 , and the second has no contribution ( by noticing that @xmath130 is odd ) .",
    "the remaining integral , i.e. :    @xmath131    is obtained from appendix a.    finally :     @xmath132    eq.([49 ] ) is fundamental and gives the straightforward link between the semiclassical level density @xmath91 , and the strutinsky level density @xmath133 in the asymptotic limit @xmath134 , with the necessary condition of the smoothing procedure @xmath135 .",
    "it should be noted that it is @xmath133 which is deduced from @xmath91 and not the opposite .",
    "moreover , @xmath103 does not depend on any free parameter .",
    "therefore @xmath103 must be considered as the `` true '' smooth level density ( the so - called smooth component of the quantum density ( [ 1 ] ) ) , and @xmath29 is its fermi level.the quantity @xmath136 is the remainder of the averaging . from ( [ 49 ] ) , it can easily be identified with the relative error :    @xmath137    and represents the noise ( for the density of states ) of the strutinsky method . in actual calculations , it is implicit , and thus unknown",
    ". it is contained intrinsically in @xmath133 .",
    "it is easy to check from ( [ 49 ] ) that the coefficient @xmath138 in the remainder decreases theoretically to zero as @xmath3 increases to infinity ( @xmath19,@xmath2 being fixed ) , provided that @xmath139 is sufficiently regular .",
    "this in principle improves the average .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen in subsec.[79 ] that large values of @xmath140 involve necessary a slight increasing of @xmath2 in the smoothing procedure , which in turn increases somewhat the remainder as it can easily be seen from ( [ 49 ] ) .",
    "thus , it is not possible to reduce the remainder without ending .    in practical cases",
    ", the `` optimal choice '' @xmath141 leads to a very good precision , i.e. @xmath142 .    from rel.([49 ] ) it is clear that the dependency on the two parameter @xmath143 becomes more and more weak as the remainder decreases to zero.the only one special case where the remainder vanishes rigorously is that one where @xmath118 is a pure polynomial of degree less or equal to @xmath3 .",
    "this happens in the harmonic oscillator case .",
    "for this reason , the strutinsky method must not be `` judged '' in this example when @xmath144 .",
    "fundamentally , the strutinsky level density appears in ( [ 49 ] ) only as an approximation ( and thus is not strictly equivalent as it is often claimed ) to the semiclassical level density .",
    "consequently , the smooth strutinsky energy eq.([11 ] ) , and the strutinsky shell correction of eq.([48 ] ) must also be considered as an approximations to the respective semiclassical quantities given by eq.([25 ] ) and eq.([95 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we shall see in the next subsection that the remainder tends also to zero with @xmath29 like @xmath145 , and thus becomes negligible only in the `` asymptotic limit '' @xmath146 .",
    "it is instructive , to apply our result ( [ 49 ] ) for the cases seen previously , i.e. , the harmonic oscillator ( [ 16 ] ) and the cubic box ( 18 ) with the previous assumptions @xmath147 .",

    "one should not be too `` impressed '' by this case ( see subsection [ 468 ] ) .",

    "thus , for the smooth energy , the strutinsky method is a good approximation of the semiclassical method .",
    "a straightforward consequence is that the smooth ( strutinsky ) energy @xmath180 becomes practically independent on the smoothing parameters @xmath181 in this limit .",
    "we give in fig .",
    "3 an illustration of the relative error for the strutinsky energy for the cubic box    fig.3a : same conclusions as fig.2a , i.e. @xmath182 and @xmath170 are indistinguishablefig.3b : there also , the relative error on the strutinsky energy ( with respect to the semiclassical energy ) tends toward zero in the asymptotic limit @xmath183  and approaches the theoretical value @xmath184 given by eq.([9173 ] ) .      as seen before",
    ", the relative error plays a major role in the strutinsky energy .    from rel.([11111 ] ) , it is clear that if @xmath185 , the relative variations of the strutinsky energy @xmath165 _ are small compared to _",
    "@xmath165 itself ( or to @xmath186 ) .",
    "for instance , if one plots @xmath165 as a function of the parameter @xmath44 ( @xmath3 and @xmath29 being constant ) it appears a `` plateau '' in the graph .",
    "this means that @xmath187 is `` practically constant at the scale of its own value '' ( at least in the interval @xmath188 ) , i.e. :    @xmath189    ( which is close to ( [ 11111 ] ) ) .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the derivative of @xmath165 cancels as in the traditional plateau condition @xcite . the same remark holds for the strutinsky density .",
    "we must point out that the relative error is proportional to the quantity @xmath190 , so that the plateau is improved at large values of @xmath191    fig .",
    "4 shows an illustration of the plateau ( defined by ( [ 22222 ] ) ) for the energy in the cubic box case    fig.4a : the strutinsky energy @xmath192 of the cubic box is plotted as function of @xmath2 for four values of the order @xmath149 .",
    "the particle - number is fixed arbitrarily at @xmath193 with a fermi level @xmath194 .",
    "it is clear that the fluctuations @xmath195 are small compared to @xmath196 . at this `` scale ''",
    "a clear plateau is noticed.fig.4-b : the same figure as fig.4-a at a `` reduced scale '' shows the important variations of the plateau , especially on the r.h.s of the figure . if we continue to `` zoom in '' the curve , it appears several minima and maxima ( i.e. @xmath197 )",
    ". some of them , have nothing to do with a plateau .",
    "for example , in the vicinity of @xmath198 @xmath199 a minimum occurs for the order @xmath200 which does not really belong to any plateau .",
    "thus our `` macroscopic '' definition of the plateau seems more `` adapted '' than the old version based on the `` stationarity '' of @xmath192 with respect to @xmath201 .",
    "in fact , it contains implicitly the concept of the relative error which plays a central role in the numerical applications in the method . indeed the minimization of the relative error ( see below ) avoids the ambiguity of the ( old ) plateau condition , because a stationary point is not necessary a plateau , whereas the minimization of the relative error leads indisputably to the true value ( at the very least to the optimal value ) of the smooth energy , an thence of the shell correction ( see below ) .",
    "first , one must recall that the strutinsky shell correction and the semiclassical shell correction are respectively defined through rel.([48 ] ) and ( [ 95 ] ) , i.e.    @xmath202 ,    @xmath203    subtracting the second equation from the first , and using rel.([7411 ] ) , one obtains a straightforward relation between these two quantities . :",
    "@xmath204    since @xmath205 is considered as an approximation to @xmath170 ( see previous subsection ) , the strutinsky shell correction @xmath206 must be also regarded as an approximation to the semiclassical shell correction @xmath207 . in this respect , @xmath208 represents the same absolute error in both formulae ( [ 7411],[7413 ] ) .",
    "however , the essential point is that , this error has not the same importance in these two results indeed , the two shell corrections @xmath209 , and @xmath210 are obtained as the difference between two close large numbers ( i.e. the sum of single - particle energies and their averages ) therefore they are significantly smaller compared to these quantities ( i.e. @xmath192 or @xmath211).for example , the ref @xcite gives for the case of @xmath212sn ( neutrons ) the typical `` realistic '' values @xmath213 @xmath214 , @xmath215 @xmath216 ( the order @xmath3 is not prcised in that work ) , and hence , the shell correction @xmath217 @xmath216 is thus , much smaller than @xmath218 .",
    "consequently , the same absolute error @xmath219 which is relatively small in eq.([7411 ] ) might become non negligible in eq.([7413 ] ) for the strutinsky shell correction.in addition , in a number of cases the shell correction might also become so small that the relative error ( _ in the shell correction _ ) has no longer a sense .",
    "thus , for the shell correction , the relative error does not play the same leading role as for the strutinsky energy ( or the strutinsky density ) , so that the ( strutinsky ) shell correction might become strongly dependent to the choice of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the error could exceed the shell correction itself if this error is not optimized ( i.e. minimized ) .",
    "the shell correction is defined as the difference between two quantities @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .",
    "only the latter depends on the parameter @xmath2 ( and also @xmath222 ) through the remainder @xmath172 from ( [ 7411 ] ) . by minimizing this remainder ( i.e. the relative error ) with respect to @xmath2 , we make @xmath169 as close as possible to @xmath211 , therefore we make @xmath223 as close as possible to @xmath210 ( i.e. the true shell correction ) .",
    "thus , the minimization of the relative error made on @xmath169 , should lead to the independency ( or at least to a weak dependence ) of @xmath224 on the parameters @xmath225 .",
    "thence , we can affirm that it is the minimization of this relative error which is the source of the plateau , not the opposite .",
    "this should be the most appropriate way for finding the true ( or the best ) value of the shell correction .",
    "fig.5 displays a practical illustration of this minimization ( the so - called `` rule of relative remainder '' ) .",
    "we show in fig.5a how to find the optimal value for the parameter @xmath44 in the cubic box case .",
    "we again consider in fig.5a the case given in fig.4athe steps are the following :    * first we calculate the strutinsky energy at the fermi level @xmath226 as a function of the parameter @xmath44 ( @xmath227 being fixed ) , for some close values of the order @xmath3 .",
    "* we must minimize the remainder of rel.([11111 ] ) as follows :    @xmath228    * then , this quantity is plotted as a function of @xmath2 for each value of @xmath3 .",
    "thence , we should look for the minimum of this function ( relative error ) .",
    "however for a fixed @xmath3 , this function has an oscillatory behavior ( around zero ) which leads to several local minima .",
    "nevertheless , due to the fact that these curves do not cancel simultaneously , it is possible to remove these unpleasant oscillations by considering the mean relative error over some ( relative close ) values of @xmath3.the mean relative error ( over @xmath229 ) on the strutinsky energy is plotted against @xmath44 .",
    "the minimum ( optimal ) value is found to be about @xmath230 and corresponds effectively to the best value ( see fig.5b)in fig.5b , we note a good agreement between the true value ( semiclassical ) given by the upper straight line @xmath231 and the strutinsky values .",
    "in fact , for the optimized @xmath44 , the calculated values are @xmath232,@xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , for @xmath236at last the sum of single - particle energies is @xmath237 .",
    "the true shell correction @xmath238 , and the corresponding strutinsky shell corrections are thus : @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , which are in good agreement with the true ( exact ) value . without optimization the results of the strutinsky shell correction will certainly be random .",
    "first , we must note that the spectrum of the finite potential is composed of discrete negative levels plus a continuum .",
    "for this potential , the definition of the exact level density ( [ 1 ] ) must be modified by adding an appropriate continuous expression @xmath243 :    @xmath244    for spherical potentials , the continuum is defined by the scattering phase shift , whereas for the deformed case it can be solved by the more complicated s - matrix method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "next , one recalls that the result ( [ 49 ] ) ( which is the basis of the present work ) comes from eq.([400 ] ) .",
    "the latter is valid for any smooth potential regardless whether it is infinite or not .",
    "indeed , it is to be noted that the interval of averaging in ( [ 400 ] ) goes from @xmath245 up to @xmath246 so that the preceding demonstration remains still valid for a finite well .",
    "one has simply to add the continuum of ( [ 27 ] ) to the discrete spectrum into this integral .",
    "thence , as for infinite potentials , it is clear that the strutinsky s level density should also be an approximation to the semiclassical level density for finite wells .    in practice , the rigorous treatment of the continuum is not easy .",
    "the standard recipe consists of using the discrete positive energies to `` simulate '' this continuum @xcite .",
    "these energies are usually obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix in a truncated harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "in fact , this delicate problem seems now to be solved by the so - called gfoe method ( green s function oscillator expansion ) @xcite which improves the standard method ..      it is well - known that the level density of finite potential becomes singular at the top of the well @xcite,@xcite . for this reason ,",
    "it is not possible to find a local polynomial approximation to the semiclassical level density in the vicinity of this singularity . in other words ,",
    "the least square averaging ( [ 2 ] ) does not hold in this case , precisely because @xmath247 , as @xmath248 , i.e. at the zero - energy .",
    "this explains why the two methods do not lead to the same results , especially for the weakly bound nuclei .",
    "far from the zero - energy there is no problem",
    ".      it would be interesting to determine the limit where the strutinsky level density deviates significantly from the semiclassical density .",
    "to this end , we will be comparing numerically the strutinsky level density to the semiclassical ( wigner - kirkwood ) level density by employing the  result of ref @xcite :    @xmath249    with :    @xmath250   \\label{798 } \\\\",

    "the classical turning points @xmath254 are defined by @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the fermi level the numerical integration giving @xmath257 is made with the help of an `` improved '' gauss - legendre quadrature formula.the eigenvalues used in the strutinsky level density are calculated by the code published in @xcite.in the two methods we employ strictly the same hamiltonian and the same set of parameters , i.e. we use the woods - saxon potential with spin - orbit term and the coulomb potential for the protons . for this test",
    "we work with the @xmath258pb ( neutrons ) with a spherical nuclear shape .",
    "the parameters ( in @xmath259 @xmath260 ) are : @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 .",
    "their definition is given in @xcite .",
    "thus , in fig.6 , we have drawn the semiclassical level density ( denoted by semicl . ) and the strutinsky density as function of the fermi level for three cases ( the numerical values of the smoothing parameters are given in the figure ) .",
    "* we can check in the three cases that the strutinsky level density is practically equal to semiclassical density in the `` intermediate '' region ( between the top and the bottom of the well ) irrespectively of the order @xmath3 of the smoothing procedure .",
    "indeed , we have shown in the subsection [ 580 ] that in the asymptotic limit ( i.e. for medium and heavy nuclei ) the strutinsky density of states ( not the strutinsky shell correction ! ) should not be very sensitive to both free parameters of the method .",
    "however , although with @xmath47 one obtains a good relative error on the density of states , one improves more this error at sufficient large values of m. * as expected , due the reason invoked above , fig.6 shows that the strutinsky densities differ from the semiclassical result essentially at the top of the well . in the `` intermediate region '' there is no difference .",
    "near the singularity , it is more advantageous to choose high values for the order @xmath3 . with @xmath267 ,",
    "the strutinsky calculation seem to work reasonably well up to about @xmath268 @xmath216 , beyond this limit the precision is lost .",
    "* however , we should not forget that it is the semiclassical density which is the `` true '' quantity .",
    "due to the importance of the difference between the two methods near the zero - energy , the semiclassical method must in principle be preferred for the weakly bound nuclei .",
    "although this paper explains a number of aspects and `` subtleties '' of the strutinsky method , we will insist on some essential points :    \\1 ) the strutinsky level density appears in the fundamental rel.([49 ] ) only as an approximation ( and is not strictly equivalent as it is often claimed ) to the semiclassical level density .",
    "consequently , the shell correction calculated by the strutinsky s method should also be considered as an approximation to the semiclassical shell correction .",
    "\\2 ) semiclassical quantities such as the level density , the energy , the shell correction must be considered as the `` true '' quantities compared to those obtained with the strutinsky method .",
    "moreover , they do not depend on any free parameter .    unlike the semiclassical method",
    ", the strutinsky method contains an intrinsic noise ( remainder ) .",
    "the ambiguity of the method comes from the dependence on the two free parameters through this remainder .",
    "\\3 ) it turns out that the remainder is proportional to @xmath269 and is defined in this paper as the relative error . in the asymptotic limit @xmath183 , i.e. for medium and heavy nuclei , the relative error is small , especially for higher @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , it is found that the strutinsky method gives good results for the average level density , and the average energy . in these cases",
    "the dependency on the free parameters is weak .    on the contrary , in the shell correction",
    "the relative error is no longer small .",
    "the shell correction might become strongly @xmath159-dependent .",
    "the choice of these two free parameters must be treated with care . in this context , in order to minimize the relative error , we propose the `` rule of the relative remainder ( rrr ) '' .",
    "\\4 ) for realistic potentials , the semiclassical level density admits a singularity at the top of the well .",
    "since the strutinsky method is a least - squares approximation to the semiclassical level density ( demonstrated in this paper ) , the averaging fails near this singularity . in this case , the two densities are different , and it is not surprising to note a strong dependence on the parameters @xmath270 in this region , even if the continuum is treated properly .",
    "consequently , for the weakly bound nuclei ( drip - line ) it is better to use the semiclassical method .",
    "our personal conclusion , is that the semiclassical method with a `` good numerical treatment '' should , in theory , be quite superior to the strutinsky method .",
    "the latter can be considered only as a good palliative method .",
    "@xmath272 ,  ( see subsec.468 )    first , one must note that @xmath273 of ( [ 4 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath274    indeed , with the help of the christoffel - darboux formula ( chap 22 of 16 ) :    @xmath275    one finds for our case :    @xmath276    @xmath277 ,    since @xmath3 is even , @xmath278 , this gives the cited expression    to calculate the integral @xmath271 , we have to replace @xmath279 by the preceding result .",
