    "nonintegrable perturbations can be analysed in terms of the basic excitations of such integrable models [ scott , 1999 ] .",
    "these integrable systems are often shown to be linearizable in the sense that they can be associated with two linear differential equations ( of which one is a linear eigenvalue problem ) , namely the so called lax pairs . in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , the exponentially localized stable entity ,",
    "namely the soliton , turns out to be the basic structure exhibiting elastic collision property .",
    "the soliton excitation has remarkable physical and mathematical properties .",
    "in particular , the underlying nonlinear evolution equations exhibit infinite number of lie - bcklund symmetries [ bluman & kumei , 1989 ] .",
    "the lie point symmetries lead to similarity reductions which are related to painlev type ordinary differential equations ( odes ) which are free from movable critical singular points .",
    "more generally , the integrable soliton equations satisfy the painlev property and the solutions are in general free from movable critical singular manifolds .    in the case of nonlinear reaction diffusion equations ,",
    "the dynamics is dominated by the onset of patterns [ murray , 1989 ; walgraef , 1996 ; lakshmanan & rajasekar , 2003 ] . out of all possible modes available to the system , they tend to select the most stable structures which give rise to various patterns .",
    "these patterns range from simple to chaotic , depending on the nature of diffusion , nonlinear reaction terms and external forces as well as the spatial dimension . some of the dominant patterns are + ( 1 ) homogeneous or uniform states + ( 2 ) travelling waves + ( 3 ) wavefronts and pulses + ( 4 ) turing structures : a ) stripes b ) spirals c ) scrolls , etc .",
    "+ ( 5 ) spatiotemporal chaos + and so on .",
    "thus mode selection and stability dominates the study of such systems .",
    "some of the well known nonlinear diffusion and reaction - diffusion systems[murray , 1989 ; walgraef , 1996 ; whitham , 1974 ] include burgers equation , fisher equation , kuromoto - sivashinsky equation , gierer - meinhardt equation , fitzhugh - nagumo equation , belousov - zhabotinsky reaction equation , brusselator model equation and so on .",
    "a large amount of literature on such systems is available .    in view of the complexity involved in analysing nonlinear diffusion equations",
    ", it will be very valuable to identify integrable nonlinear diffusive systems and to build on them the study of nonintegrable cases .",
    "burgers equation is a standing example of such an integrable case [ sachdev , 1987 ] .",
    "it is linearizable in the sense that the burgers equation @xmath1 under the cole - hopf transformation @xmath2 gets transformed into the linear heat equation @xmath3 similarly the fokas - yortsos - rosen equation [ fokas & yortsos ; 1982 & rosen , 1982 ] @xmath4 under the variable transformations [ rosen , 1982 ] @xmath5 gets again transformed into the linear heat equation eq .",
    "( [ int3 ] ) .",
    "thus both the above systems are linearizable and they may be considered to be c - integrable in the calogero [ 1991 ] sense .",
    "also both the burgers equation and fokas - yortsos - rosen equation possess interesting lie point symmetry structures and infinite number of lie - bcklund symmetries .",
    "so , it will be of interest to investigate whether other integrable and linearizable nonlinear reaction - diffusion equations exist and if so what is the role of symmetry therein and what kind of solution structures and patterns exist in them .    considering nonlinear reaction - diffusion equations ,",
    "fisher equation is considered to be prototypical [ murray , 1989 ] .",
    "typically , its form reads as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the laplacian operator . in one dimension",
    "it admits travelling wavefronts with velocities @xmath8 , depending on the initial condition [ murray , 1989 ] and in two dimensions interesting spatiotemporal patterns arise ; however _ it is not integrable in any dimensions_. in one dimension , however it is known to have an exact propagating wavefront solution of the form [ ablowitz & zeppetella , 1979 ] @xmath9^{-2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an arbitrary constant , corresponding to the wave speed @xmath11 .",
    "no other exact solutions are known for eq .",
    "( [ int6 ] ) .",
    "in this connection , it has been pointed out [ grimson & barker , 1994 ] that there arises interesting generalization of the fisher equation in the description of bacterial growth in multicolony environment , in chemical kinetics and in various living phenomena .",
    "its general form is @xmath12 ^ 2+\\lambda u({\\bf r},t ) g(u ) , \\label{gfe1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath14 and @xmath7 are gradient and laplacian operators respectively . to be specific , eq .",
    "( [ gfe1 ] ) represents the spatiotemporal growth of bacterial colonies with both local and nonlocal modes of growth . the third term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gfe1 ] ) represents the local growth characterised by the local growth rate @xmath15 and a local growth function @xmath16 .",
    "suppose the colony is unable to add cells locally due to packing constraints , the nonlocal addition of cells on the surface of the colony occurs to account for the amount of growth required by the global growth law .",
    "such an addition occurs as a consequence of the expansion and reorganization of the colony and is represented by the second term while the first term represents diffusion .",
    "an important special case of eq .",
    "( [ gfe1 ] ) is the generalized fisher type equation @xmath17 where the subscript denotes partial differentiation with respect to time . in the study of population dynamics",
    ", @xmath18 refers to the population density at the point @xmath19 at time @xmath20 . in eq .",
    "( [ gfe2 ] ) , the nondiffusive linear term modelling the birth rate gives rise to an exponential growth of @xmath18 in time while the quadratic term that models competition between individuals for food , etc .",
    "leads to a stable , homogeneous value @xmath21 at long times and the diffusion term represents the spatial variation of the population .",
    "further the third term represents the nonlocal growth of cells while the fourth term corresponds to the local growth .",
    "this introduces the possibility of spatial pattern formation between the homogeneous regions with @xmath21 and @xmath22 for appropriate initial conditions .",
    "note that for @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ gfe2 ] ) reduces to the standard fisher equation ( [ int6 ] ) .",
    "again eq .  ( [ gfe2 ] ) is in general nonintegrable , except for the special case @xmath0 .",
    "it is linearizable under the transformation @xmath24 as pointed out by wang _",
    "et al . _ [ 1996 ] for the one dimensional case ( see also brazhnik and tyson [ 1999a , b ] ) . under this transformation the generalized fisher equation ( [ gfe2 ] ) can be shown to reduce to the form @xmath25 which is nothing but the linear heat equation in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "thus every solution of ( [ gfe4 ] ) corresponds to a solution of eq .",
    "( [ gfe2 ] ) via the transformation ( [ gfe3 ] ) subject to boundary and initial conditions .",

    "such a _ linearization in any dimensions is a rare situation _ indeed . even in soliton theory ,",
    "straightforward extensions of integrable equations lose their integrability as soon as the dimension is increased .",
    "in fact wang _",
    "et al . _ [ 1996 ] and brazhnik and tyson [ 1999a , b ] make use of this linearizability property to obtain several interesting wave solutions , spatiotemporal patterns and static structures .",
    "the very special nature of the @xmath0 case prompts us to investigate the integrability nature of the generalized fisher equation ( [ gfe2 ] ) from different points of view , particularly from singularity structure and symmetry points of view in order to understand why the case @xmath0 alone is integrable . for the nonintegrable case ( @xmath26 ) we investigate special solutions .    in sec .",

    "we give the nonclassical and generalized conditional reductions in secs .",

    "finally , we summarise our results in sec .",
    "it has been argued for sometime that the painlev property ( p - property ) as proposed by weiss _ et al . _ [ 1983 ] is a working test to identify whether a given nonlinear partial differential equation ( pde ) is integrable or not .",
    "the painlev property demands that the solution of the given nonlinear pde is free from movable critical singular manifolds ( branching types , both algebraic and logarithmic as well as essential singular ) , so that the solution is single valued in the neighbourhood of a noncharacteristic movable singular manifold , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the weiss tabor carnevale ( wtc ) procedure then demands that the solution @xmath18 for eq .",

    ", the generalized fisher equation can be written as @xmath33 the wtc algorithm then identifies the following results . starting with the leading order behaviour @xmath34 as suggested by the form ( [ pain1 ] )",
    ", one can identify three possibilities : @xmath35 one can easily check that for all the above three leading orders , only for the value @xmath0 , the solution is free from movable critical singular manifolds .",
    "actually one finds that for @xmath0 and @xmath36 , the leading order coefficient @xmath37 is an arbitrary function in addition to the arbitrary nature of the singular manifold so that the laurent series contains the required number of arbitrary functions in terms of which all the other coefficient functions @xmath38 , can be uniquely found . for the other two leading orders with @xmath0 , one identifies only one arbitrary function but without the introduction of any movable critical singular manifolds and so they may be considered as corresponding to special solutions .",
    "the above analysis also holds good in higher dimensions of ( [ gfe2 ] ) as well .",
    "consequently one finds that the p - property is satisfied only for the special choice of parameter , @xmath0 for eq .",
    "( [ gfe2 ] ) and for all other values of @xmath39 it fails to satisfy the p - property and the system is expected to be nonintegrable .",
