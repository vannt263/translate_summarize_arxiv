    "in the dynamical triangulation model of four dimensional euclidean quantum gravity the path integral over metrics on a certain manifold is defined by a weighted sum over all ways to glue four - simplices together at the faces @xcite .",
    "this idea was first formulated in @xcite , using hypercubes instead of simplices .",
    "the partition function of the model at some fixed volume @xmath0 is @xmath1 the sum is over all ways to glue @xmath0 four - simplices together , such that the resulting complex has some fixed topology which is usually ( as well as in this article ) taken to be @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 are the number of @xmath4-simplices in this complex .",
    "@xmath5 is a coupling constant which is proportional to the inverse of the bare newton constant : @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that the model has two phases . for low @xmath5",
    "the system is in a crumpled phase , where the average number of simplices around a vertex is large and the average distance between two simplices is small . in this phase",
    "the volume within a distance @xmath7 appears to increase exponentially with @xmath7 , a behaviour like that of a space with constant negative curvature . at high",
    "@xmath5 the system is in an elongated phase and resembles a branched polymer .",
    "as is the case with a branched polymer , the ( large scale ) internal fractal dimension is 2 .",
    "the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical value @xmath8 which depends somewhat on @xmath0 .",
    "this transition appears to be a continuous one , making a continuum limit possible @xcite . at the transition",
    ", the space behaves in several respects like the four dimensional sphere @xcite .",
    "in the regge discretization of general relativity , all the simplices are pieces of flat space .",
    "the curvature is concentrated on the subsimplices of codimension two , in our case the triangles . on these triangles",
    "it is proportional to a two - dimensional delta function . from the definition of curvature as the rotation of a parallel transported vector , one can find the integrated curvature over a small region @xmath9 around such a triangle @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the area of the triangle and @xmath12 is the deficit angle around the triangle ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the deficit angle around a triangle is the angle which is missing from @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the simplices around the triangle and @xmath16 is the angle between those two faces of the simplex that border the triangle .",
    "the angle @xmath12 can be negative .    in dynamical triangulation ,",
    "all the simplices have the same size and shape and the deficit angle is a simple function of the number @xmath17 of simplices around the triangle",
    ". then expression ( [ simpcurv ] ) reduces to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the angle between two faces of a simplex , which for @xmath20 dimensions equals @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the now constant area of a two simplex .    for each triangle",
    "we can define a local four volume that belongs to the triangle by assigning that part of each adjoining simplex to it which is closer to the triangle than to any other . for equal simplices ,",
    "this just results in @xmath23 per adjoining simplex with @xmath24 the volume of a four simplex .",
    "in other words this local volume is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the region of space associated to that triangle .",
    "it is not clear what @xmath27 would mean in the continuum limit .",
    "we define it here mainly to compare our results with other work on simplicial quantum gravity .",
    "if we view the delta function curvature as the average of a constant curvature over the region @xmath26 , this constant curvature would be equal to @xmath28    because neither a constant term nor a constant factor is important for the behaviour of correlation functions , we will in the rest of this paper for convenience use the definitions @xmath29",
    "one of the interesting aspects of the dynamical triangulation model one can investigate is the behaviour of two - point functions of local observables . because we are looking at observables defined on the triangles we consider correlations between the triangles , at a fixed distance @xmath30 which is also defined in terms of triangles .",
    "such a correlation function of an observable @xmath31 will be denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "we define the geodesic distance between two triangles as the smallest number of steps between neighbouring triangles needed to get from one to the other . for this purpose , we define two triangles to be neighbours if they are subsimplices of the same four - simplex and share an edge . other definitions of neighbour are conceivable .",
    "one such a definition would be to define two triangles to be neighbours if they share an edge , irrespective of whether they are in the same simplex .",
    "the one we use has the advantage that it is quite narrow and therefore results in larger distances .",
    "the idea behind our correlation functions is as follows . for each configuration",
    "generated according to the ensemble ( [ partfunc ] ) , we take a random pair @xmath33 of triangles at distance @xmath30 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the triangles . for this pair",
    "we calculate the observable @xmath36 .",
    "then we go to the next configuration and repeat the process .",
    "finally we take the average over all such pairs .",
    "if no such pair exists for a particular configuration , the configuration is discarded .",
    "obviously , this method would be very inefficient in practice .",
    "we improve the statistics by using the average value of @xmath37 over all pairs @xmath33 at distance @xmath30 in each configuration .",
    "therefore , we calculate for each configuration @xmath38 taking the average over configurations @xmath39 results in the correlation function @xmath40    other definitions are conceivable .",
    "one can take random pairs of triangles from the collection of all configurations .",
    "configurations with relatively many pairs of triangles at distance @xmath30 will then be counted more often . in formula",
    ", it results in the correlation function @xmath41 a few experiments did not show a qualitative difference in the behaviour of ( [ corrfunc ] ) and ( [ altcorr ] ) at the distances considered below .",
    "however , for large distances where the finite size of the configurations comes into play , the difference becomes significant .    a third possibility , which is natural in regge calculus , treats @xmath42 as a local volume element at @xmath34 in a discrete approximation to a continuum integral over euclidean spacetime : @xmath43 in this paper we explore the form ( [ corrfunc ] ) .",
    "we expect that the correlations constructed from either ( [ corrfunc ] ) , ( [ altcorr ] ) or ( [ altcorr2 ] ) will behave identically for not too large distances . in a large system ,",
    "compared to the distance under consideration , the sum over the triangles will introduce a self - averaging which probably makes the difference in averaging between ( [ corrfunc ] ) and ( [ altcorr ] ) irrelevant .     for various values of @xmath5 .",
    "]    in figure  [ rawrrmafig ] we have plotted the correlation function of the curvature , with the square of its expectation value subtracted .",
    "most of the data in this paper are for a volume @xmath44 simplices .",
    "the values of @xmath5 correspond to a system in the crumpled phase ( @xmath45 ) , near ( but slightly below ) the transition ( @xmath46 ) and in the elongated phase ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "configurations were recorded every @xmath48 sweeps , where a sweep is defined as a number of accepted moves equal to the number of simplices @xmath0 . for @xmath45 , @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "we used @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 configurations respectively .",
    "one thing is immediately striking , the correlation functions do not go to zero at long distances . to keep the short distance behaviour visible , the full range in the elongated phase has not been plotted , but we already see that also in this phase it crosses the zero axis and indeed this curve does eventually go to large ( @xmath54 ) positive values .     for various values of @xmath5 . ]",
    "the local volume @xmath27 is proportional to the number of simplices @xmath55 around a triangle @xmath4 .",
    "we see that in this model , this observable @xmath27 is essentially the same as the scalar curvature . at first sight",
    ", one would therefore expect them to have the same behaviour .",
    "if one is positively correlated , the other one would also be positively correlated .",
    "figure  [ rawggmafig ] shows the correlation of @xmath56 .",
    "we see that quite the opposite is true . with few exceptions ,",
    "@xmath56 is positively correlated where @xmath57 is negatively correlated and vice versa .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that reported for the regge calculus formulation of simplicial quantum gravity in @xcite .",
    "there it is also found that the curvature correlations are positive and the volume correlations negative at large distances .",
    "this difference in behaviour can be explained intuitively as follows .",
    "because triangles with large @xmath56 have more neighbours , any random triangle will have a large chance to be close to a point with large @xmath56 and a small change to be close to a point with small @xmath56 .",
    "so whatever the value of @xmath56 at the origin , the points nearby have large @xmath56 and the points far away have small @xmath56 .",
    "the average @xmath58 will then be large at small distances and small at large distances .",
    "because large @xmath56 means small @xmath59 , the situation is reversed if we substitute @xmath59 for @xmath56 in this discussion , qualitatively explaining figs .",
    "[ rawrrmafig ] and  [ rawggmafig ] .    at first sight",
    "one might conclude from this explanation that a point with large @xmath56 having many neighbours is just an artefact of the model .",
    "this is not true , however .",
    "large @xmath56 corresponds to large negative curvature and also in the continuum a point with large negative curvature has a larger neighbourhood . to be more precise , the volume of @xmath30-dimensional space within a radius @xmath7 around a point with scalar curvature @xmath59 equals @xmath60",
    "for various values of @xmath5 . ]",
    "the above reasoning leads us to the somewhat unusual concept of a correlation function which does not depend on some observable at the origin .",
    "we define such a correlation as @xmath61 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote a triangle . in the more usual case of a quantum field theory on flat space",
    "this could never depend on the distance , but here it does .",
    "the reason is that we correlate functions of the geometry with the distance , which is itself a function of the geometry .    figure  [ rawrfig ] shows this correlation function .",
    "no average has been subtracted .",
    "the behaviour of this one - point function turns out to be very similar to that of the curvature correlation in figure  [ rawrrmafig ] .",
    "this correlation function again shows that any particular point has a large chance to be in the neighbourhood of a point with low curvature , which can be simply explained with the fact that points with low curvature have more neighbourhood .",
    "the same plot for @xmath56 ( not shown ) shows the opposite behaviour . at small distances",
    "it is larger than average , while at large distances it is smaller than average .",
    "this is rather obvious , because where @xmath56 is large , its inverse is small and vice versa .",
    "( upper curves of each pair ) and the squared one - point function @xmath62 ( lower curves ) at various values of @xmath5 . ]",
    "we can now investigate how much of the curvature correlation shown of figure  [ rawrrmafig ] is due to this effect .",
    "figure  [ rrandr2fig ] compares the curvature correlation @xmath63 with the square of this one - point function .",
    "we see that , except at small distances , the two are indistinguishable on this scale . in other words",
    ", we have not been measuring any curvature correlations .",
    "all we have measured are correlations between the curvature and the geodesic distance . similarly , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are nearly equal .",
    "it is now easy to explain the difference in behaviour between the curvature and the volume correlations .",
    "because they are almost equal to the square of @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , they behave just like them . and",
    "as we just mentioned it is easy to understand that these have opposite behaviours .     at various values of @xmath5 . ]     at various values of @xmath5 . ]",
    "the way to go now is to subtract the two things and see what real curvature correlations are left .",
    "this is similar to subtracting a disconnected diagram and keeping the connected part .",
    "we get the corrected correlation functions @xmath68 the results for the curvature are plotted in figure  [ analttfig ] and those for the volume in figure  [ analggfig ] .",
    "the errorbars were found by a jackknife method , each time leaving out one of the configurations in the calculation of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "now both correlations behave almost exactly the same .",
    "note the large difference in scale between these figures and figures  [ rawrrmafig ] and  [ rawggmafig ] .     near the phase transition at @xmath71 and @xmath72 . ]    in the crumpled phase we were not able to fit @xmath69 to a simple function .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that we can not reach very large distances in this phase . near the transition",
    "however it is possible to fit the correlation function to a power law decay , at not too small distances .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ lltransfig ] . in the region",
    "@xmath73 it fits nicely to @xmath74 with the result @xmath75 this data was made at a volume of @xmath76 simplices , with @xmath77 .",
    "we used @xmath78 configurations , which were recorded every 5000 sweeps .",
    "a similar fit using @xmath79 gives a compatible power , @xmath80    this result should be taken with caution , however .",
    "one would really like to have a good fit over a larger range .",
    "to get some idea of the typical ranges involved , we consider the number of triangles at a given distance @xmath30 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of triangles of the configuration . the corresponding quantity with ` triangles ' replaced by ` four - simplices ' was studied more closely in @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath83 where @xmath84 has its maximum , is an indication of the distance at which finite size effects might become important . at @xmath72 ,",
    "this @xmath83 is only 11 , indicating that finite size effects may play a role in the measured power .     in the elongated phase at @xmath47 . ]",
    "the situation is even better far in the elongated phase . here",
    "a power law fits well , as can be seen in figure  [ llelongfig ] .",
    "this fit was done to the points @xmath85 and the parameters of this fit are for @xmath86 @xmath87 and for @xmath79 @xmath88    the value of @xmath30 with maximum number of triangles was 32 , so in this case we are in a region of small distances compared to the system size .",
    "this data was made from @xmath89 configurations of @xmath76 simplices .",
    "we have also fitted the connected correlation functions at other points far in the elongated phase and at @xmath90 simplices .",
    "the power that emerged was within the errors equal to the one given above .",
    "we have investigated the behaviour of the curvature and volume correlation functions .",
    "it turned out that the naive correlation functions could be almost entirely described by a `` disconnected part '' , which we therefore subtracted .",
    "the difference turns out to behave according to a power law in the elongated phase and near the transition .",
    "this indicates the presence of massless excitations .",
    "an obvious question is what the continuum observables are corresponding to the correlation functions we have measured .",
    "generally , in a scaling region , a lattice operator is equivalent to a combination of various continuum operators , weighted with powers of the lattice distance @xmath91 according to their dimensions . in a previous paper @xcite we found evidence for scaling in a surprisingly wide region around the transition value of @xmath5 . assuming that the theory can be described by a continuum metric tensor @xmath92 with corresponding curvature @xmath59 , the continuum observable with lowest dimension corresponding to our lattice correlation function would be given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the geodesic distance between the points @xmath34 and @xmath35 for a given metric @xmath92 .",
    "the uniqueness of the lowest dimension correlation function in the continuum is in accordance with the fact that we found identical behavior for @xmath86 and @xmath79 , up to an overall factor .",
    "of course , we do not know the effective action specifying the average in ( [ continuum1 ] ) .",
    "it could be a combination of @xmath95 and higher order @xmath96 terms .",
    "the fact that the connected correlation function is negative suggests that it registers fluctuations in the conformal mode of @xmath92 .    in a previous paper @xcite we explored the possibility of a semiclassical region near the transition , in which the system behaves like a four - sphere for not too small or large distances . to this end",
    ", we defined a scale dependent effective curvature . for @xmath5 near the transition the following picture emerged . at small distances ,",
    "this effective curvature is large , indicating a planckian regime . at intermediate distances",
    "there seems to be a semiclassical regime , where the space behaves like a four - sphere .",
    "the fluctuations around this approximate @xmath2 might then correspond to gravitons .",
    "we consider it therefore encouraging that we find the power law behaviour .    for the volumes in current use",
    ", the effective curvature shows that the semiclassical regime sets in at a distance roughly 0.6 of @xmath97 ( cf .",
    "fig .  13 in @xcite ) . here , @xmath97 is the geodesic distance through the simplices where the number of simplices @xmath98 has its maximum .",
    "we conjectured this fraction to go down at larger volumes .",
    "similarly , a little beyond 0.6 of @xmath99 turns out to be the distance where the curvature correlations start to behave like @xmath100 in fig .",
    "[ lltransfig ] .",
    "we like to think of this as a confirmation of the point of view sketched above .",
    "two - point functions of curvature and volume have been studied in the regge calculus formulation of simplicial quantum gravity in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these studies",
    "there are only results in what is called the well - defined phase of the regge calculus approach , which corresponds to our crumpled phase .",
    "this makes it hard to do more than the qualitative comparison which was done in section  [ twopointsec ] .",
    "the curvature correlations have also been investigated in the continuum . in ref .  @xcite they were found to be of zero range in the tree approximation to einstein gravity . to",
    "one loop order we may expect on dimensional grounds a behavior @xmath101 in flat space , and @xmath102 for @xmath2 , where @xmath103 is newton s constant and @xmath104 is the @xmath2 background curvature .    in @xcite",
    "a theory is developed for the conformal factor in four - dimensional quantum gravity and from this the curvature correlation is calculated .",
    "the conformally invariant phase discussed in @xcite seems to correspond to the elongated phase in the dynamical triangulation model .",
    "intuitively , this can be understood by visualizing large fluctuations in the conformal factor as generating many baby universes .",
    "many baby universes is also a feature of the branched polymer like elongated phase of simplicial quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the conformally invariant phase would occur at very large distance scales .",
    "in @xcite we argued that the elongated phase also describes scales which are large compared to a typical physical curvature scale . in this conformally invariant phase a power law is predicted for the curvature correlations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , a direct comparison with @xcite is not possible because in the continuum the correlation function is defined as a function of the distance in a fixed fiducial metric , a quantity that is not yet defined in our model .",
    "our result @xmath105 for the power in the elongated phase is quite different from the @xmath106 , which corresponds to the analogue central charge @xmath107 suggested in @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank emil mottola for discussions .",
    "we furthermore thank piotr biaas for useful comments on a first version of this paper . this work is supported in part by the stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) .",
