    "recently the bes collaboration  @xcite reported a near - threshold enhancement in the proton - antiproton ( @xmath0 ) invariant mass spectrum , observed in the @xmath1 decay .",
    "signs for a low mass @xmath0 enhancement had been already seen earlier by the belle collaboration in their study of the @xmath7 decay  @xcite as well as in the reaction @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "but because of the large statistical uncertainties of the belle data it was difficult to draw concrete , quantitative conclusions about the extent of the near threshold @xmath0 enhancement . the new data by bai et al .",
    "@xcite , however , are of rather high statistical accuracy and therefore provide very precise information about the magnitude and the energy dependence of the @xmath0 mass spectrum very close to threshold .    the bes collaboration @xcite fitted their @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum below 1.95  gev by a breit - wigner resonance function .",
    "assuming that the @xmath0 system is in an @xmath3-wave resulted in a resonance mass of @xmath9  mev and a total width of @xmath1030  mev .",
    "a comparable fit to the data could be achieved with a @xmath11-wave breit - wigner function with @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev .",
    "the proximity of these resonance masses to the @xmath6 reaction threshold ( which is at 1876.54 mev ) nourished speculations that the observed strong enhancement could be a signal of an @xmath2 bound state .",
    "while theoretical considerations of such @xmath2 bound states ( or of baryonia , in general ) abound in the literature  @xcite there is so far hardly any undisputed experimental information on the existence of such states @xcite .",
    "thus , the supposition that one has found here independent and possibly even more convincing evidence in support of @xmath2 bound states is certainly appealing .    an alternative explanation put forward by the bes collaboration invokes similarities of the observed enhancement in the @xmath6 mass spectrum near threshold with the strong energy dependence of the electromagnetic form factor of the proton around @xmath14 , in the timelike region , as determined in the reaction @xmath15 @xcite . in the latter case",
    "it was argued that the sharp structure seen in the experiment could be caused by a narrow , near - threshold vector - meson ( @xmath16=@xmath17 ) resonance @xcite with @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a pertinent discussion . )",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that the quantum numbers of the @xmath20 particle ( @xmath16=@xmath17 ) would restrict such a resonance to occur in a pseudoscalar ( @xmath21 ) or scalar ( @xmath22 ) state  should it be indeed responsible for the enhancement of the near - threshold @xmath6 mass spectrum in the decay @xmath1 .",
    "an entirely different and much more conventional interpretation of the observed enhancement was suggested in several recent works  @xcite .",
    "these authors argue that the enhancement is primarily due to the final state interaction ( fsi ) between the produced proton and antiproton .",
    "specifically , it was shown within the scattering length approximation @xcite that a calculation with a complex @xmath3-wave scattering length extracted from an effective - range analysis of @xmath0 scattering data can reproduce the shape of the @xmath0 mass distribution close to the threshold .    in the present paper we analyse the near threshold enhancement in the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum reported by the bes collaboration utilizing a realistic model of the @xmath2 interaction @xcite .",
    "the elastic part of this model is the @xmath23-parity transform of the bonn meson - exchange @xmath24 potential , supplemented by a phenomenological complex potential to account for @xmath2 annihilation .    as just mentioned , the investigations of kerbikov et al .",
    "@xcite as well as those of bugg @xcite rely on the scattering length approximation .",
    "but it remains unclear over which energy range this approximation can provide a reliable representation of the energy dependence of the @xmath6 amplitude .",
    "the enhancement seen in the bes data extends up to invariant masses of @xmath252 gev , which corresponds to center - of - mass energies of around 120 mev in the @xmath6 system .",
    "it is obvious that the simple scattering length approximation can not be valid over such a large energy region . using the @xmath6 amplitude of our interaction model ( which describes the available @xmath2 scattering data up to center - of - mass energies of 150 mev  @xcite )",
    "we can examine to what extent the scattering length approximation can indeed reproduce the energy dependence of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude .",
    "moreover , we can compare the energy dependence induced by the full @xmath6 amplitude with the bes data over the whole energy range where the enhancement was observed .",
    "a microscopic @xmath2 model has a further advantage .",
    "it yields predictions for all possible spin- and isospin channels .",
    "thus , we can investigate whether the energy dependence of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath2 scattering amplitudes in the @xmath28 and @xmath4 isospin channels is compatible with the bes data .",
    "( we use the nomenclature @xmath29 but omit the isospin index when referring to both isospin channels or to isospin averaged results . ) the analysis of kerbikov et al .",
    "utilizes scattering lengths obtained from a spin - averaged effective - range fit to the low - energy @xmath2 data .",
    "those values might be strongly influenced or even dominated by the @xmath30 @xmath2 partial wave , a channel which can not contribute to the fsi in the @xmath1 decay because of charge - conjugation invariance .",
    "let us finally mention that the work of zou and chiang @xcite does not employ the scattering length approximation but uses the @xmath31-matrix formalism .",
    "however , their interaction consists only of one - pion exchange and is therefore not realistic because it does not take into account the most striking feature of low - energy @xmath2 scattering , namely annihilation .",
    "recall that near the @xmath6 threshold the annihilation cross section is twice as large as the elastic @xmath6 cross section @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : in sect .",
    "ii we briefly review the @xmath2 potential model that is used in the present analysis and examine the reliability of the scattering length approximation on the @xmath2 amplitude for the partial waves relevant to the analysis of the bes data .",
    "the possible influence of the coulomb interaction is discussed as well . in sect .",
    "iii we provide details of our calculation of the near - threshold @xmath6 mass spectrum for the reaction and we compare our results with the measurement of the bes collaboration .",
    "iv is devoted to a discussion of possible signals of @xmath2 bound states or ( sub @xmath32 threshold ) meson resonances in the @xmath6 mass spectrum .",
    "the paper ends with concluding remarks .",
    "in the present investigation we use one of the @xmath2 models developed by the jlich group @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use the bonn obe ( one - boson - exchange ) model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite whose results are also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter",
    "work the model is called a(obe ) and we also adopt this name in the present paper .",
    "the model a(box ) is based on the obe version of the full bonn potential derived in time - ordered perturbation theory , i.e. obept in ref .",
    "the g - parity transform of this interaction model constitutes the elastic part of the @xmath2 potential .",
    "a phenomenological , isospin- and energy - independent complex potential of gaussian form is added to account for the @xmath2 annihilation . with only three free parameters ( the range and the strength of the real and imaginary parts of the annihilation potential ) a good overall description of the low- and intermediate energy @xmath2 data was achieved .",
    "results for the total and the integrated elastic and charge - exchange cross sections as well as angular dependent observables can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here in fig .",
    "[ pbar7 ] we show only the elastic @xmath6 cross section .",
    "we also utilized the most complete @xmath2 model of the jlich group , model d published in ref .",
    "the elastic part of this interaction model is derived from the g - parity transform of the full bonn @xmath24 potential and the annihilation is described in part microscopically by @xmath33 2 meson decay channels - see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "but since the results turned out to be qualitatively rather similar to the ones obtained with a(obe ) we refrain from showing them here .",
    "the differential cross sections for @xmath0 scattering  @xcite already indicate a substantial contribution from higher partial waves at around 10 mev above the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "this feature is also reflected in the predictions of the @xmath2 model . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ pbar7 ] shows the contribution from the @xmath26 partial wave .",
    "the dotted and dash - dotted lines illustrate the total contributions from @xmath34 and @xmath35 waves , respectively .    since the scattering length approximation to the @xmath2 amplitude",
    "was used in two of the analyses of the bes data @xcite we want to investigate the validity of this approximation . in the following",
    "we ignore the proton - neutron mass difference and also the coulomb interaction in the @xmath6 system , in order to simplify the discussion .",
    "but we will come back to these issues later .    in the scattering length approximation the @xmath3-wave @xmath0 scattering amplitude @xmath36",
    "is given by @xmath37 where the scattering length @xmath38 is a complex number because of inelastic channels ( annihilation into multimeson states ) that are open already at the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the proton momentum in the c.m .",
    "system is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the proton mass .",
    "results for @xmath41 for the @xmath26 partial wave are presented in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ pbar6 ] .",
    "the solid lines are the result for the full amplitude while the dashed lines are based on the scattering length approximation given by eq.([scat1 ] ) .",
    "note that the scattering lengths predicted by the @xmath2 model , which we use for the @xmath26 partial wave are @xmath42  fm and @xmath43  fm for the isospin @xmath28 and @xmath4 channels , respectively .",
    "it is evident that the scattering length approximation does not reproduce the energy dependence of the scattering amplitude that well . for the @xmath4 channel the difference at an excess energy of 50 mev amounts as much as 50 % .",
    "the difference is even more pronounced for the @xmath28 channel , where we already observe large deviations from the full result at rather low energies .",
    "this strong failure of the scattering length approximation is due to the much smaller scattering length predicted by our model for the @xmath28 partial wave .",
    "results for the @xmath30 partial wave are shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ pbar6 ] . here",
    "the scattering lengths predicted by the @xmath2 model are @xmath44  fm and @xmath45  fm for the @xmath28 and @xmath4 channels , respectively .",
    "as pointed out above , this partial wave can not contribute to the reaction @xmath1 .",
    "but it is still interesting to see how well the scattering length approximation works in this case .",
    "obviously we also see similar shortcomings here .",
    "thus , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ pbar6 ] that the use of the scattering length approximation allows only a very rough qualitative estimate of the effects of fsi but it is definitely not reliable for a more quantitative analysis of the bes data .    nevertheless , one has to realize that the main uncertainty in estimating @xmath6 fsi effects does not come from the scattering length approximation but from our poor knowledge of the @xmath6 @xmath26 amplitudes near threshold and of the @xmath1 reaction mechanism .",
    "for example , the scattering lengths employed by kerbikov et al .",
    "are spin - averaged values .",
    "since the @xmath30 partial wave contributes with a weighting factor 3 to the @xmath6 cross sections ( and there are no spin - dependent observables at low energies that would allow one to disentangle the spin - dependence ) it is obvious that their value should correspond predominantly to the @xmath30 amplitude .",
    "thus , it is questionable whether it should be used for analyzing the bes data at all because the contribution of the @xmath30 partial wave to the decay @xmath1 is forbidden by charge - conjugation invariance .",
    "but even the availability of genuine @xmath26 amplitudes ( which are necessarily model dependent ) does not solve the problem .",
    "the reaction @xmath1 can have any isospin combination in the final @xmath6 state .",
    "a dominant reaction mechanism involving an intermediate isoscalar meson resonance ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ,  ... ) , cf .",
    "[ diag]c , would yield a pure @xmath28 final @xmath6 state , whereas an intermediate isovector meson resonance ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ,  ... ) leads to pure @xmath4 . on the other hand , mechanisms like the ones depicted in fig .",
    "[ diag]a , b generate the usual equal weighting of the two isospin amplitudes .    in this context",
    "let us mention that the spin - averaged @xmath6 scattering length predicted by the model a(box ) , @xmath50  fm , is in rough agreement with the value extracted from the level shifts of antiproton - proton atoms , cf .",
    "table 8 in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , this averaged value differs significantly from the scattering length in the @xmath51 partial wave  which is one of the possible final states in the decay @xmath1 . at first glance",
    "one would tend to believe that the unusually small real part of @xmath52 is basically accidental and reflects the fact that the @xmath26 state enters with smaller statistical weight into the @xmath6 cross section and , therefore , is much less constrained by the @xmath6 data .",
    "however , exploratory calculations with the other @xmath2 models of the jlich group revealed that the real part of the @xmath51 scattering length is always small ( and often of a different sign from the other @xmath3 waves ) . for example , the more involved @xmath2 model d published in ref .",
    "@xcite , yields @xmath53  fm .",
    "moreover , the @xmath2 models of dover - richard also and kohno - weise predict rather small values for the real part of the @xmath51 scattering length , as is evident from the results presented in ref .",
    "the paris @xmath2 potential , on the other hand , predicts the real parts of the @xmath54 scattering lengths to be of similar magnitude - cf .",
    "table iv in ref .",
    "@xcite . but",
    "11 of that paper suggests that the central potential in the @xmath55 , @xmath56 channel has been drastically modified inside 1 fm as compared to what follows from the @xmath23-parity transformation of the paris @xmath24 potential . in the jlich @xmath57 models no such changes are introduced when deriving the elastic part of the @xmath57 interaction via @xmath23-parity !",
    "a closer examination of our @xmath2 models disclosed that here the smallness of @xmath58 is definitely caused by the one - pion exchange contribution , i.e. by long - range physics .",
    "switching off this contribution always led to a large scattering length similar to the one in the @xmath4 channel , whereas modifications of the short - range contributions to the elastic part of the @xmath2 potential had hardly any qualitative influence on the scattering lengths .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to obtain experimental constraints on the @xmath54 scattering lengths .",
    "corresponding measurements could be performed at the future gsi facility flair @xcite , where it is possible to have a polarized antiproton beam @xcite , as required for inferring the spin - triplet and spin - singlet amplitudes from the data .",
    "the @xmath1 decay rate is given as  @xcite @xmath59 where the function @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 @xmath62 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system , @xmath63 is the proton angle in that system , while @xmath64 is the photon angle in the @xmath20 rest frame .",
    "after averaging over the spin states and integrating over the angles , the differential decay rate is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total @xmath1 reaction amplitude . note that @xmath66 is dimensionless .",
    "the differential rate @xmath67 , integrated over the range from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , yields the partial @xmath1 decay width , @xmath70 kev  @xcite .    the solid line in fig .",
    "[ pbar5 ] is obtained with eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) by using a constant @xmath71 .",
    "this result corresponds to the so - called phase space distribution .",
    "the actual value of @xmath71 was adjusted to the data at @xmath72 gev , i.e. around the @xmath47 resonance region .",
    "the circles in fig .",
    "[ pbar5 ] show data for the @xmath1 decay published by the bes collaboration  @xcite .",
    "evidently , close to the @xmath0 threshold the data deviate substantially from the phase space distribution .",
    "since close to the threshold the phase space factor introduces a strong but trivial energy dependence of the mass distribution it is convenient to divide the experimental @xmath0 spectrum by the kinematical factors that appear on the right side of eq.([trans ] ) and extract the invariant amplitude @xmath71 from the data .",
    "corresponding results for the bes data  @xcite are shown by the squares in fig .",
    "[ pbar4 ] .",
    "it is obvious that the experimental reaction amplitude exhibits a very strong mass dependence near the @xmath0 threshold . in recent investigations @xcite",
    "this feature has been attributed to a strong final state interaction ( fsi ) between the outgoing protons and antiprotons .",
    "indeed , an enhancement and/or a strong energy dependence of near - threshold cross sections has been seen in many other reactions involving hadrons and is commonly seen as to be caused by fsi effects , cf . @xcite .",
    "thus , it is plausible and it even has to be expected that fsi effects play a role in the decay @xmath1 as well . the interesting issue is primarily whether the proton - antiproton interaction is really strong enough to induce such a sizeable enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "a very simple and therefore also very popular treatment of fsi effects is due to watson  @xcite and migdal  @xcite .",
    "these authors suggested that the reaction amplitude for a production and/or decay reaction which is of short - ranged nature can be factorized in terms of an elementary production amplitude @xmath73 and the @xmath6 scattering amplitude @xmath36 of the particles in the final state , @xmath74 where @xmath73 is given by diagrams like those shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ] and @xmath75 is a normalization factor .",
    "if the production mechanism is of short range then the amplitude @xmath73 depends only very weakly on the energy and the near - threshold energy dependence of the reaction amplitude is driven primarily by the scattering amplitude , @xmath36 , of the outgoing particles .",
    "this means that in the case of the reaction @xmath1 the near threshold mass dependence of the @xmath0 spectrum should be dominated by the energy dependence of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude . in the analyses of the bes data by kerbikov",
    "@xcite and by bugg @xcite the above treatment of fsi effects was adopted .    however , the prescription of watson ",
    "migdal is only valid for interactions that yield a rather large scattering length , like the @xmath26 @xmath24 partial wave where the scattering length @xmath38 is in the order of 20 fm , and even then only for a relatively small energy range , as was pointed out in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present case , where the scattering lengths are in the order of 1 fm one should be cautious with the interpretation of results obtained from applying eq.([fsi ] ) . rather one should start from the more general expression for the reaction amplitude , @xmath76 which corresponds to a distorted wave born approximation .",
    "if one assumes that the production amplitude , @xmath77 , has only a very weak energy- and momentum dependence it can be factorized and one obtains @xmath78 = a_0   \\psi^{(-)*}_{q_p}(0 ) , \\label{fsidw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is a suitably normalized @xmath2 continuum wave function and @xmath80 is nothing else but the inverse of the jost function @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 @xcite .",

    "obviously , eq.([fsidw2 ] ) is formally equivalent to the watson - migdal prescription of eq.([fsi ] ) if @xmath85 is large . in case of the @xmath24 @xmath26 partial wave",
    "@xmath85 is indeed large , as has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in considering the @xmath3-wave interaction in the final @xmath0 system",
    "one should account for the centrifugal barrier between the photon and the @xmath0 state given by the factor @xmath86^{l_\\gamma},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath87=1 being the orbital momentum between the photon and the @xmath0 system . around the threshold , @xmath88",
    ", the centrifugal correction depends only weakly on the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system and basically does not modify the mass dependence of the fsi . within the range @xmath89  gev the factor @xmath90 varies between 0.23 and 0.27 , which is not large enough to counterbalance the contribution from the strong @xmath3-wave fsi over the same invariant - mass range .    note also that the watson - migdal formula ( [ fsi ] ) has to be modified when used for @xmath0 fsi effects in a @xmath11-wave . since in the production reaction",
    "only the final momentum is on - shell one has to divide the on - shell @xmath36 matrix by the factor @xmath91 in order to impose the correct threshold behavior of the production amplitude .",
    "let us first discuss calculations based on the watson - migdal approach given by eq .",
    "( [ fsi ] ) .",
    "the solid lines in fig . [ pbar4 ] show the @xmath0 invariant scattering amplitudes squared for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 partial waves and the @xmath28 and @xmath4 channels .",
    "we consider the isospin channels separately because , as mentioned above , the actual isospin mixture in the final @xmath0 system depends on the reaction mechanism and is not known .",
    "note that all squared @xmath6 scattering amplitudes @xmath41 were normalized to the bes data at the invariant mass @xmath92=50 mev by multiplying them with a suitable constant .",
    "the results indicate that the mass dependence of the bes data can indeed be described with fsi effects induced by the @xmath26 scattering amplitude in the @xmath4 isospin channel .",
    "the @xmath28 channel leads to a stronger energy dependence which is not in agreement with the bes data",
    ". we can also exclude dominant fsi effects from the @xmath27 partial waves . here the different threshold behaviour due to the @xmath11-wave nature can not be brought in line with the data points very close to threshold .",
    "it should be clear , of course , that a suitable combination of several partial waves might as well reproduce the experimental results on the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "note that we do not include the coulomb interaction in our model calculation and we also ignore the difference in the @xmath6 and @xmath93 thresholds .",
    "judging from the results shown by kerbikov et al .",
    "@xcite their influence is noticeable only for excess energies below say 5 mev .",
    "accordingly we do not consider the lowest data point of the bes experiment , which lies in the first ( 5 mev ) energy bin , in our discussion .",
    "our results support the conjecture of kerbikov @xcite and bugg @xcite that the enhancement seen in the near - threshold @xmath6 invariant mass spectrum of the decay @xmath1 could be primarily due to fsi effects in the @xmath6 channel .",
    "but we should also consider the @xmath6 invariant mass spectrum of the decay @xmath94 which was presented by the bes collaboration in the same paper @xcite . here",
    "the near - threshold mass distribution does not show any enhancement as compared to the phase - space distribution  though one would likewise expect strong fsi effects in the @xmath6 channel . in this reaction isospin",
    "is preserved and the possible partial waves in the final @xmath6 state , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , differ from those available in the decay @xmath1 .",
    "but the @xmath95 partial wave amplitude of the jlich @xmath2 model , shown in the lower part of fig . [ pbar6 ] , leads to fsi effects that are comparable to those of the @xmath97 state  and in contradiction with the experimental @xmath98 mass distribution - as illustrated in fig .",
    "we should mention in this context that the issue of the @xmath98 mass distribution is not discussed in the work of bugg , while kerbikov argues that in the effective range parameterization that he employs @xmath99 is much smaller than @xmath100 and therefore there should be much smaller fsi effects in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "however , our experience is that @xmath6 amplitudes with a small @xmath101 often yield an even stronger energy dependence and therefore larger fsi effects - see the case of the @xmath51 partial wave in fig .",
    "[ pbar6 ] .    in our opinion these seemingly contradictory results can only be reconciled if we assume that the treatment of fsi effects by means of eq.([fsi ] ) is oversimplified and one should use eq.([fsidw2 ] ) instead .",
    "results based on the latter equation are shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ be8 ] where we set @xmath102 .",
    "it might be possible that a fine tuning of @xmath84 could allow one to better reproduce the bes data for the @xmath103 channels , though in view of the rather large statistical variations in the data we refrain from doing so . in any case it is obvious that the more refined treatment of the fsi effects based on eq .",
    "( [ fsidw2 ] ) leads , in general , to a weaker energy dependence of the @xmath6 mass spectrum .",
    "it is important to note that the near - threshold contribution to the @xmath1 decay rate is relatively large .",
    "the contribution to @xmath1 up to invariant @xmath6 masses of @xmath104 2 gev is roughly 5 times larger than the rate for the reaction @xmath105 followed by the @xmath106 decay .",
    "taking into account that the latter rate was recently published  @xcite as br=@xmath107 we can estimate that @xmath108 where @xmath109 indicates the near - threshold contribution of this partial wave  which is indeed a large fraction of the total @xmath1 branching rate that amounts to @xmath110 .",
    "this suggests that in this energy region the reaction @xmath1 could be indeed dominated by a resonance .",
    "such a resonance should lie below the @xmath6 threshold but , unlike the resonance state which emerged from the breit - wigner fit of the bes collaboration @xcite , its mass could be significantly below the @xmath0 threshold and it could have a large width , like the @xmath49 or @xmath111 resonances that are listed in the particle physics booklet @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the scenario in fig .",
    "[ pbar3 ] . for illustration",
    "we consider the @xmath48(1800 ) meson with mass and width 1801 and 210 mev , respectively .",
    "the corresponding resonance amplitude squared is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ pbar3 ] .",
    "its energy dependence is , of course , too weak and does not agree with the near - threshold @xmath6 mass spectrum found by the bes collaboration .",
    "however , when the @xmath48(1800 ) resonance decays into a proton and antiproton , a final state interaction should occur .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ pbar3 ] shows the total reaction amplitude squared , taken now as the product of the resonance amplitude and the @xmath0 scattering amplitude in the @xmath97 partial wave as is given by eq.([fsi ] ) .",
    "the corresponding result is roughly in line with the bes data .",
    "though this line of reasoning is certainly more a plausibility argument , rather than a solid calculation , we believe that it makes clear that one has to be rather cautious when trying to extract resonance properties by fitting the near threshold @xmath0 mass spectrum with a resonance amplitude , because any final state interaction will necessarily and substantially distort the production amplitude .",
    "a different and alternative scenario consists in assuming the formation of many multimesonic intermediate states in the @xmath20 decay that couple strongly to the @xmath0 system where again a strong fsi occurs . the branching rates of the @xmath20 radiative decays into the @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 channels are larger than @xmath116 and the transition of those mesonic states into the @xmath0 final state could be sufficiently strong  @xcite .",
    "thus , such a scenario can not be excluded by the available data .",
    "finally , let us come back to the other proposed explanation for the enhancement in the @xmath0 mass spectrum , namely near - threshold @xmath2 bound states .",
    "clearly a description of the experimental mass spectrum in terms of @xmath0 fsi effects does not contradict the existence of such states . indeed , in case of the @xmath24 interaction the strong fsi effects are interconnected with the existence of a near - threshold bound state ( deuteron ) or anti bound - state in the corresponding @xmath30 and @xmath26 partial waves .",
    "however , the @xmath2 model that we used in the present study does not lead to any near - threshold bound states .",
    "in fact , we found only two bound states for the model a(obe ) within 100 mev from the threshold , namely at @xmath117 = 104@xmath118413 mev in the @xmath51 partial wave and at @xmath117 = 24.2@xmath118107 mev in the @xmath119 partial wave . obviously both bound states lie rather far away from the real axis and therefore should have practically no influence on the @xmath0 scattering amplitude near threshold .",
    "we have investigated suggested explanations for the near - threshold enhancement in the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath1 decay , reported recently by the bes collaboration .",
    "in particular , we showed that the near - threshold enhancement in the @xmath0 mass spectrum can , in principle , be understood in terms of a final state interaction in the outgoing proton - antiproton system . within our model calculation",
    "it can be described with the scattering amplitude in the @xmath97 @xmath0 partial wave but disagrees with the energy dependence that follows from the @xmath51 and both ( @xmath120 ) @xmath27 amplitudes .",
    "we showed that the scattering length approximation can not be used for a more quantitative evaluation of the energy dependence of bes data .",
    "in general , it does not reproduce the energy dependence of the scattering amplitude reliably enough within the @xmath0 mass range required . at the same time , one has to concede that the lack of knowledge of the reaction mechanism for @xmath1 and the insufficient information on the @xmath0 interaction near threshold precludes any more quantitative conclusions , even when microscopic models are used - as in the case of the present study .",
    "we argued also that the use of the simple watson ",
    "migdal prescription for treating fsi effects has to be considered with caution for the present case in view of the small @xmath6 scattering lengths , whose real parts are typically in the order of only one fermi",
    ". our suspicion is nourished , in particular , by the observation that the experimental @xmath0 mass spectrum of the comparable decay @xmath5 does not show any obvious sign of a @xmath0 fsi , while applicaton of the watson ",
    "migdal prescription would yield a similar , strong , near - threshold enhancement as for the @xmath121 channel for any of the @xmath2 models we utilized .",
    "we demonstrated that a consistent qualitative description of the @xmath0 invariant mass spectra from the decay reactions @xmath1 and @xmath5 can be achieved , however , within a more refined treatment of fsi effects as it follows from a dwba approach .",
    "though our study shows that the enhancement seen in the decay @xmath1 could indeed be a result of the fsi in the @xmath0 system one has to admit that due to the uncertainties mentioned above and the controversal situation in the @xmath122 channel explanations other than final state effects can not be ruled out at the present stage .",
    "since the available data on the reaction @xmath5 are afflicted by large error bars it would be desirable to obtain improved experimental information here that allows one to quantify the extent of @xmath6 fsi effects in this reaction .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , other reactions involving the @xmath6 system in the final state , such as @xmath7 decay  @xcite or @xmath8  @xcite do show some indications for @xmath6 fsi effects .",
    "but here too the quality of the available data is too poor to permit any reliable conclusions .    in this context",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath0 mass spectra for the reactions @xmath123 or @xmath124 would be rather interesting for clarifying the role of @xmath6 fsi effects in the decay of the @xmath20 meson .",
    "both reactions restrict the isospin in the @xmath0 system to be zero so that one could explore the fsi for specific @xmath6 partial waves , namely @xmath51 and @xmath125 .",
