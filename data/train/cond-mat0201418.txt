    "protein crystallisation is of great practical importance , both as a purification method and since high quality crystals are needed for x - ray diffraction work @xcite . under typical conditions where crystals are obtained ,",
    "protein - protein interactions appear to be characterised by hard core repulsions with short - ranged attractions @xcite .",
    "for instance , rosenbaum _ et al _",
    "@xcite successfully collapsed the crystallisation boundaries for a number of proteins onto the adhesive hard sphere ( ahs ) model  @xcite by matching the second virial coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "whilst the ahs model is frequently used to understand protein crystallisation , it is also possible that crystallisation is an energetic ordering transition driven by highly directional interactions . a model of hard spheres with sticky patches",
    "was introduced by sear to capture this important possibility @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i examine the properties of a simple model for protein crystallisation which takes into account the effects of charge in a very elementary way .",
    "such a model suggests that some generic aspects of protein crystallisation can be explained as a straightforward consequence of charge neutrality , at least for lysozyme which readily undergoes crystallisation .",
    "these various aspects are : ( i ) the overall shape of the crystallisation boundary , ( ii ) a scaling collapse of the crystallisation boundary noticed by poon _ et al _",
    "@xcite when plotted as a function of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the nacl concentration and @xmath3 the protein charge ; ( iii ) a similar scaling of the lysozyme solubility data in guo _",
    "et al _  @xcite ; and ( iv ) a similar scaling for @xmath0 noticed by egelhaaf and poon @xcite .",
    "the appearance of @xmath1 in all these is very reminicent of the donnan membrane equilibrium @xcite , where one finds a contribution to @xmath0 equal to @xmath4 provided one is in the high - salt limit @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the protein concentration .",
    "the effect is well known in polyelectrolyte theory @xcite .",
    "this result is usually derived by supposing ideal solution behaviour and imposing electrical neutrality on the two sides of a semi - permeable membrane . in the present case ,",
    "i argue there is an analagous donnan equilibrium between protein crystals and a dilute protein solution , with the crystal - solution interface playing the role of the membrane .",
    "the appearance of @xmath1 as a scaling variable reflects the fact that the solution ( not necessarily the crystal ) is in the high - salt limit , as will be explained below .",
    "donnan s theory appears to have little to do with the more conventional mcmillan - mayerapproach @xcite in which effective potentials between proteins are invoked to explain crystallisation and the effects of added salt , often in the context of dlvo potentials @xcite where debye - hckel  theory is used to account for the charge interactions .",
    "however , a careful study of the relationship between the two approaches made by hill in the 1950s indicates both approaches should converge on the same results in the high salt limit @xcite .    to apply these ideas to the protein crystallisation problem ,",
    "one constructs a free energy which enforces the charge neutrality constraint .",
    "small ions can be treated as ideal solution species , but one must at least incorporate non - ideality of the protein solution , to allow it to form the ordered phase whch represents the protein crystals . the first thing to do",
    "is to set up this general theory .",
    "i suppose the proteins under consideration have a molecular volume @xmath7 , for example lysozyme is a charged globular protein of approximate size @xmath8 @xcite , or a molar volume @xmath9 where @xmath10 is avogadro s number . if the protein concentration is @xmath6 , the effective volume fraction is @xmath11 . in the absence of charge effects , a baseline model which incorporates a freezing transition to correspond to protein crystallisation",
    "will be fully specified by a dimensionless free energy density @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the free energy of the protein solution or crystal , @xmath14 is the system volume , and @xmath15 .",
    "there may be different branches of @xmath16 to correspond to the fluid and ordered ( crystal ) phases .",
    "below i shall consider two possibilities for this baseline model : sear s model of hard spheres with sticky patches , and the ahs model .",
    "the full free energy is obtained from the baseline model by adding in contributions from the coions and counterions ( which i suppose to be univalent ) and imposing charge neutrality .",
    "if the added salt concentration is @xmath2 , there will be coions at a concentration @xmath2 and counterions at a concentration @xmath17 . denoting the dimensionless free energy density for the full model by @xmath18 , i write @xmath19\\hspace{6em}\\\\[4pt ] { } + ( { q}\\phi+{\\phi_s})[\\log({q}\\phi+{\\phi_s})-1 ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the last two terms are the ideal mixing terms from the coions and counterions respectively , written using @xmath20 for notational simplicity .",
    "unimportant constants and terms linear in @xmath21 or @xmath22 have been dropped .",
    "non - ideality of the small ions is neglected in the present treatment , although this is certainly a refinement which should be considered for more quantitative work .",
    "this free energy is a function of two density variables : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a phase equilibrium such as between protein crystals and protein solution corresponds to equality of osmotic pressure and chemical potentials for _ both _ components . as a consequence there will in general be _ different _ values of @xmath22 in coexisting phases , a salt repartitioning effect which is not usually taken into account . to solve for phase equilibria",

    "the _ difference _ in protein volume fraction between the solution and crystal is often @xmath40 .",
    "putting @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , this corresponds to a cross - over salt concentration @xmath43 .",
    "if the salt concentration is much less than this , there will be a large osmotic pressure difference between the crystal and the solution due to the counterions , having the effect of narrowing the coexistence gap .",
    "this is the basic reason why the coexistence boundary occurs at salt concentrations of this order of magnitude in this model .",
    "it is a much larger cross - over salt concentration than intuition might have suggested based on experiences for colloidal systems ( eg @xmath44 , @xmath45 gives @xmath46 ) , but then globular proteins are much smaller than colloids .",
    "on the other hand , typical protein solutions on the crystallisation boundary have @xmath47 , corresponding to a cross - over salt concentration @xmath48 . for salt concentrations much larger than this ,",
    "the effects of salt and charge are subsumed into a scaling variable @xmath49 . since @xmath32 is more or less the salt concentration in the solution if the protein concentration is small , this is a natural explanation for the scaling properties described in the introduction .",
    "in the next sections , i place these arguments on a firm footing , starting with discussions of the second virial coefficient and the high - salt scaling of solubility , since these are not dependent on any particular baseline model .     for lysozyme , where @xmath50 , as a function of salt concentration @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "the quasi - universal crystallisation boundary observed by poon _ et al _",
    "@xcite can be fit reasonable well by the present version of sear s model with @xmath119 sticky contacts per molecule , similar to the conclusions of other workers @xcite .",
    "the scaling collapse for @xmath0 noticed by egelhaaf and poon @xcite is here attributed to a contribution @xmath4 added to a ` bare ' @xmath53 which is approximately _ independent _ of salt concentration above about @xmath120 . in this system therefore , nacl appears to be acting as an _ indifferent electrolyte _ in the sense that it does not seem to exhibit specific ion effects .",
    "this appears to be confirmed by the experiments of morozova _ et al _",
    "@xcite discussed in the preceeding section .",
    "other salts , for example nabr , may not behave the same way of course .",
    "the other conclusions are general ones .",
    "firstly , a simple extension of existing models to incorporate salt ions and charge neutrality provides a straightforward explanation for the shape of protein crystallisation boundaries and the associated scaling properties seen for lysozyme . even if the present theory proves inadequate to describe the experiments in quantitative detail , this is surely a robust observation .",
    "secondly , there are a large number of effects which have been omitted from the present theory , but which could be incorporated with some additional numerical effort , such as excluded volume effects , non - ideality of the salt ions , and other electrostatic correlation efects .",
    "finally , the twin phenomena of salt repartitioning and the concomitant appearance of a significant donnan potential difference discussed in the previous section are essentially many - body effects , and are not captured in simple pair - potential theories .      for discussions and correspondence ,",
