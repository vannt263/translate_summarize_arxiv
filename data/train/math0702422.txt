    "groups generated by pairs of reflections across the sides of the hyperbolic triangle @xmath1 with angles @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the vertices for positive integers @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a fundamental domain @xmath9 of @xmath0 consists of the union of a copy of @xmath1 with its reflection through any one of its sides .",
    "+ the riemann mapping theorem tells us that it is possible to find a conformal map @xmath10 from the upper half plane to @xmath1the classical schwarz triangle functions @xcite .",
    "the inverse function @xmath11 is a single valued meromorphic function which is automorphic with respect to the group , ie .",
    "@xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "here we prove the simple result that @xmath14 has rational taylor coefficients when expanded about any of the vertices of the fundamental domain in appropriate coordinates .",
    "a detailed discussion of the theory of schwarz - christoffel mappings may be found in @xcite . to summarise , given a region @xmath15 enclosed by three circular arcs with angles @xmath16 at the respective vertices @xmath17 we can find an holomorphic function @xmath18 which maps the upper half plane @xmath19 onto the interior of @xmath1 and is continuous to the boundary . here",

    "then it is easy to see that @xmath33 lies at the origin , @xmath29 lies on the positive real axis and the arcs @xmath34 , @xmath35 are straight lines , see @xcite for details .",
    "in fact @xmath1 is a hyperbolic triangle with the vertex @xmath27 at the origin of a _ scaled _ poincar disc model of the hyperbolic plane , see figure [ orthoc ] ( here the orthogonal circle @xmath36 does not have radius one ) . +     of @xmath37 . ]",
    "the normalisation @xmath38 so that @xmath36 has radius one and @xmath1 is a hyperbolic triangle in the standard poincar disc is given by @xmath39 for details of this messy calculations see @xcite",

    ". we may analytically continue @xmath37 through the real axis , avoiding the singular points @xmath47 which correspond to vertices of @xmath1 , to get a map from the cut riemann sphere to the union of @xmath1 and @xmath1 reflected through one of its sides  together forming a fundamental domain of @xmath0 .",

    "the inverse function @xmath11 is a single valued meromorphic automorphic form : there is a single pole at @xmath28 , and for a suitable definition of the group action it is automorphic , @xmath48 for all @xmath13 ( @xcite , pg .",

    "the case of a cusp having been dealt with in @xcite . + we begin by considering the taylor series of @xmath49 about the order @xmath5 vertex @xmath51 ; due to automorphy it has the form @xmath52 conversely the schwarz triangle function has an order @xmath5 branch point at the origin @xmath53 now the @xmath21 , @xmath54 etc .",
    "are rational and expanding @xmath25 in a hypergeometric series about the origin we see that as a result all the @xmath55 will be rational .",
    "this in turn implies that in @xmath56 the @xmath57 are also rational . substituting for the powers of @xmath58 in @xmath49 we solve for the @xmath59 and see that they too are rational .",

    "let us bracket @xmath49 with linear transformations @xmath60 where @xmath61 maps the hyperbolic triangle in figure [ orthoc ] so that the vertex @xmath28 ( in turn @xmath29 ) is placed at the origin of the ( scaled ) poincar disc model and the triangle is rotated so that one side is on the real axis and one vertex in the first quadrant . here",
