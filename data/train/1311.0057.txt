    "recent years have seen many attempts at spectroscopically confirming candidate galaxies at @xmath7 ( e.g. fontana et al .",
    "2010 , pentericci et al .  2011 ,",
    "vanzella et al .",
    "2011 , caruana et al .",
    "2012 , schenker et al .",
    "2012 , ono et al .  2012 ) .",
    "there are three main desired objectives for such an endeavour .",
    "the first goal is to investigate whether lyman-@xmath1 is able to emerge at all at these high redshifts , given that studies of the gunn - peterson optical depth in spectra of quasars at @xmath8 show that the fraction of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath9 ) is high enough ( @xmath10% ) to result in a complete gunn - peterson trough ( gunn & peterson , 1965 ) due to total absorption of lyman-@xmath1 photons ( becker et al .",
    "2001 , fan et al .",
    "2002 , fan et al .",
    "2006 ) , indicating that there is a large neutral fraction at higher redshifts .",
    "secondly , any detectable lyman-@xmath1 emission can be used to confirm the redshift of these objects , in so doing confirming the validity of the lyman - break technique to reliably select objects at ever higher redshifts .",
    "thirdly , since the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the early universe is expected to be much more neutral , the resonant property of the line makes lyman-@xmath1 emitters a very useful tool to probe the era of reionization .",
    "in particular , the observed fraction of lyman-@xmath1 emitters can be used to constrain @xmath9 at high redshift .",
    "detecting lyman-@xmath1 emission at @xmath7 with ground - based facilities has proven to be quite a difficult challenge , both because of technical hurdles ( e.g. small near - infrared arrays , with low quantum efficiency and without multiplexed spectroscopy ) and especially because of the faintness of any potential lyman-@xmath1 emission when compared to the bright and rapidly varying sky emission in the near - infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "for this reason , it is imperative to obtain independent spectroscopy of candidate high-@xmath2 sources , especially in view of the fact that some objects claimed to exhibit lyman-@xmath1 emission ( e.g. pell et al .",
    "2004 , lehnert et al .",
    "2010 ) could not be confirmed in subsequent observations ( e.g. weatherley , warren & babbedge  2004 , bunker et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in the present study , we significantly increase the sample size considered in our previous study ( caruana et al .",
    "2012 ) , targetting a number of @xmath2-band dropouts and a few @xmath11-band dropouts ( observed as filler targets ) to assess the emergence of lyman-@xmath1 emission at high redshift .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction in section [ sec : obs ] and present the results of our spectroscopy in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "analysis of the results and further discussion , particularly regarding possible implications for constraints on the neutral fraction of hydrogen at @xmath12 are found in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "section 5 provides a comparison with other studies in the literature .",
    "we present conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we adopt a @xmath13cdm cosmology throughout , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 km s@xmath17mpc@xmath17 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "fors2 is a multi mode ( imaging , polarimetry , long slit and multi - object spectroscopy ) optical instrument which works in the 330 - 1100 nm wavelength range and has a maximum field size of @xmath18 covered by a mosaic of two 2k@xmath194k mit ccds ( hereafter referred to as chip 1 and chip 2 ) .",
    "we note that the sensitivity of the instrument drops sharply beyond @xmath20 m ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : fors2fl_aa ] and [ fig : fors2fl_ab ] .",
    "it was used in mask exchange unit ( mxu ) mode to observe a number of @xmath2-band and @xmath11-band dropouts . for these observations",
    ", we used the 600z holographic grism and og590 order separation filter , which allowed us to span the 737 - 1070 nm region .",
    "( the precise wavelength range covered for any given slit varies slightly depending on the position of the slit on the detector . )    the main targets for our fors2 observations ( eso program numbers 086.a-0968 and 088.a-1013 , pi : a. bunker ) were a number of @xmath2-band dropouts ( table [ fors2_zdrops_table ] ) which were identified via imaging with the hubble wfc3 camera in searches conducted by wilkins et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , bouwens et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and mclure et al .",
    "the selection was geometric , satisfying the constraint that the slits must be @xmath21 long and can not overlap , with higher priority targets preferred , given a choice .",
    "we also observed a number of @xmath11-band dropouts ( table [ fors2_idrops_table ] ) , 3 of which were identified by bunker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , 2 by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) and 11 were chosen from the chandra great observatories origins deep survey ( goods)-south field , but in the case of @xmath11-drops the observations are very incomplete as these were intended to be `` filler objects '' . where no high redshift source was in slit contention ,",
    "several lower redshift sources , expected to be strong line emitters , were also placed on the mask as in - situ tests of slit alignment and line detection sensitivity . these are not discussed further here .",
    "the observations were carried out in service mode over two semesters .",
    "the first set of observations ( as part of programme 086.a-0968a ) was made on 2010 october 27 , 28 , 29 & 30 .",
    "these observations comprise 11 pairs of frames , with the telescope pointing nodded along the slit between each 1400 second frame in order to facilitate subtraction of night sky emission lines .",
    "the second set of observations ( as part of programme 088.a-1013a ) , carried out using an identically cut mask , was made on 2011 november 08 & 16 , 2011 december 03 , 06 , 10 , 11 , 14 & 16 and on january 2012 , and 2012 march 14 , 26 & 27 .",
    "these observations comprise 22 pairs of nodded frames , with each frame again having an integration time of 1400 seconds .",
    "the total integration time on the science targets was 25.67 hours .",
    "an acquisition frame was first obtained to check the pointing .",
    "the observations were dithered in an abba sequence at positions @xmath22 and @xmath23 from the central coordinates along the slit long axis ( i.e. a ` chop ' size of @xmath21 ) to enable background subtraction .",
    "the average seeing during the observations was of @xmath24 .",
    "most observations were taken at low airmass , which varied between 1.001 and 1.297 .",
    "the vast majority of the frames had an airmass of about 1.0 , so the effect of differential atmospheric dispersion is negligible .",
    "( only two frames were acquired at a higher airmass beyond the range quoted above ; for these two frames , the airmass at the start and end of the integration varied between 1.609 - 1.818 and 1.868 - 2.176 respectively . ) the resolving power attained for these observations at a wavelength of 1@xmath25 m was measured from sky emission lines to be @xmath26 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a study at @xmath27 by cowie et al .",
    "( 2011 ) highlights the importance of further investigation .",
    "cowie et al .  (",
    "2011 ) focused on 7 narrow - band selected galaxies at @xmath27 ( which were selected from the lyman-@xmath1 spectroscopic atlas of hu et al .",
    "2010 ) ; comparing these with continuum - selected samples at the same redshift , they report that the fraction of lyman-@xmath1 emitters is similar to that at lower redshifts , suggesting that they find no sign of the effects associated with reionization .",
    "so whilst , as has seen above , numerous studies do seem to be in agreement with our own findings that there is a drop in the lyman-@xmath1 fraction , it is very important to increase the sample size in order to determine whether results such as cowie et al.s ( 2011 ) might be suffering from uncertainties arising from cosmic variance in the continuum luminosity functions , or from cosmic variance in the case of patchy reionization .",
    "also , we note that since the study of cowie et al .  considers a slightly lower redshift ( @xmath27 as opposed to @xmath0 )",
    ", this discrepancy might simply be indicating that most evolution takes place at @xmath28 .",
    "such continued study would also prove useful in investigating other interesting questions , such as the homogeneity of the reionization process .",
    "dunkley et al .  (",
    "2009 ) use polarization measurements from wmap data to derive constraints for reionization , claiming that instantaneous reionization during late epochs below @xmath29 ( 6.7 ) can be rejected at the @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) level , arguing instead for an extended reionization process taking place between @xmath32 .",
    "extended reionization is also supported by the newer planck results ( planck collaboration and ade et al .",
    "the current problem is that physical models can not easily reproduce such an extended era of reionization because of the rapid recombination of hydrogen ( e.g. cen et al .",
    "studies such as the one presented here can be used to shed some light upon the question of when and over how long a period reionization took place . indeed , if the lack of observed lyman-@xmath1 emission at @xmath33 is interpreted as signifying an increase in the neutral fraction from lower redshifts , suggesting a significant departure from @xmath34 , then it would be telling us that reionization was definitely not complete by @xmath33 , constraining the redshift range over which reionization could have occurred .",
    "further spectroscopic studies on even larger samples of high - redshift galaxies hold the promise of tackling this puzzling question with greater clarity and possibly solving this cosmological problem .",
    "finally , it should be noted that there are various theoretical discussions in the literature about the interpretation of the observed drop in lyman-@xmath1 emitters at high redshift , and their use as a tool to constrain the neutral fraction .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2013 ) suggest an alternative viewpoint as to whether this drop in the lyman-@xmath1 fraction should indeed be interpreted as signifying a change in the neutral fraction from that at lower redshifts . employing a hydrodynamical simulation ,",
    "they show that towards the tail - end of reionization , in average parts of the universe the opacity of the igm red - ward of rest - frame lyman-@xmath1 can increase significantly due to a higher number of optically thick absorption systems ; a more modest rise in the volume - averaged neutral fraction , even as low as 10% , would be sufficient to reduce the transmission redward of rest - frame lyman-@xmath1 .",
    "dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2014 ) argue for the importance of considering an evolving ionizing photon escape fraction , and mesinger et al .",
    "( 2014 ) predict that igm attenuation alone would not result in a lyman-@xmath1 fraction drop larger than a factor of about 2 , indicating that any further evolution would require evolution in the properties of the galaxies themselves .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the size of the current observed sample is not sufficiently large to address the validity of these constraints .",
    "we have presented fors2 spectroscopy of 22 @xmath2-band dropout galaxies and 16 @xmath11-band dropout galaxies .",
    "we detect lyman-@xmath1 emission in 4 @xmath11-drops and a tentative emission line in one @xmath2-drop , but do not find any evidence for lyman-@xmath1 in the rest of the sample .",
    "our observations of hudf.z.4444 , a priorly observed object by fontana et al .",
    "( 2010 , g2_1408 in their catalogue ) , which was claimed to exhibit tentative lyman-@xmath1 emission at a wavelength of 9691.5 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) , rule out this emission claim at a level @xmath36 ( @xmath37 99% probability ) .",
    "our observed lyman alpha fraction is @xmath38 at @xmath33 , lower than that predicted by a factor of 2 .",
    "drawing comparisons with theoretical studies , we constrained the neutral fraction of hydrogen , @xmath9 , at z@xmath397 to be @xmath40 .",
    "we are living in very interesting times for studies of the high - redshift universe , both from an observational and theoretical perspective .",
    "currently , the sample of candidate galaxies at @xmath0 is fairly large , however , the number of spectroscopically confirmed objects remains very small .",
    "it would be a very worthwhile endeavour to extend spectroscopy to larger samples , in order to investigate whether these conclusions still hold .",
    "no doubt , theory and observation will continue to inform each other in the coming years . from a practical point of view ,",
    "studies such as the one presented in this paper show that such observations are notoriously difficult with current instrumentation , because it is challenging to obtain large samples at @xmath28 , especially because of the deteriorating effect of atmospheric emission lines , which hamper such observations and limit the level of completeness .",
    "new instruments such as kmos at the vlt will be well suited for ir follow - up surveys of such high - redshift objects , and ultra - vista will probe the bright end of the luminosity function , making it a perfectly poised instrument for selecting candidate galaxies suitable for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "follow up spectroscopy with mosfire at keck has the potential to provide the first evidence of lyman-@xmath1 emission at @xmath41 , although first attempts have not yielded any detections yet ( treu et al .",
    "2013 ) , while the vlt ifu spectrograph muse will allow us to look for lyman-@xmath1 emission over a wide redshift range ( up to @xmath42 ) and would be particularly useful in improving current constraints on the faint end of the lyman-@xmath1 emitting galaxy luminosity function and in improving measurements of the lyman-@xmath1 fraction at @xmath43 .    in the absence of spectroscopic confirmation , current estimates of the neutral fraction of hydrogen",
    "are based on an estimated redshift range . in the long term",
    ", the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) will be a workhorse instrument for both identifying ultra high - redshift galaxies and also confirming them spectroscopically with the state - of - the - art multi - object - spectrograph nirspec , which will allow us to obtain spectroscopy on more than 100 sources simultaneously .",
    "if lyman-@xmath1 is indeed not emerging at these high redshifts , then spectroscopic confirmation of high-@xmath2 candidates could be achieved using the [ oii ] line or other lines , including rest - uv absorption in the interstellar medium and stellar atmospheres .",
    "jwst will be able to confirm the redshift distribution of these sources , and finally rule out the presence of faint contaminants , hence allowing more precise estimates of the neutral fraction to be made .",
