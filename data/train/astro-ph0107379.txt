    "2001 ) , using complementary data from the _ bepposax _ , _ hut _ , _ fuse _ and _ rxte _ missions .",
    "recently , we have undertaken a more extensive study of soft x - ray emission in galaxy clusters of low / intermediate @xmath1 , with the aim of assessing the impact and cosmological significance of the _ soft excess _",
    "our efforts led to the discovery of soft excess emission in a sample of clusters in the shapley concentration ( bonamente et al .",
    "2001b ) , and while the analysis of more sources is still underway , we report in this _",
    "letter _ the brightest soft x - ray ( @xmath0 kev ) excess cluster within the _ rosat _ pspc database .",
    "the excess emission reaches @xmath2 100 % of the hot intra  cluster medium ( icm ) contribution , 3 - 4 times higher than the same for any other pspc targets ( e.g. , a1795 and virgo ; bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a ) .",
    "the inverse - compton ( ic ) interpretation of the soft emission ( see section 3 ) results in a non - thermal pressure that greatly exceeds that of the thermal gas : the excess of srsic 159 - 03 has more demanding energetic requirements than all previously known cases ( e.g. , coma , virgo and a1795 ; lieu et al . 1999 , bonamente , lieu and mittaz 2001a ) . alternatively , if the origin is thermal , the mass implications of the putative ` warm ' gas are also extreme , with the warm - to - hot gas mass ratio @xmath2 50 % ( this figure is matched only by the emission seen by euve for a2199 , however at lower statistical significance ; lieu , bonamente and mittaz 2000 ) .",
    "srsic 159 - 03 is a rich southern galaxy cluster , also known as abell s1101 , at a redshift of z=0.056 ( abell , corwin and olowin 1989 ) . the cluster s x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath3 erg / s in 0.5 - 2.0 kev , de grandi et al . 1999 ) is typical for a cluster of its temperature ( e.g. , wu , xue and fang 1999 ) , and the emission has a radial extent of @xmath2 10 arcmin ( fig .",
    "recent xmm observations ( kaastra et al . 2001 ) show a ` cooling ' of the hot icm in the central regions and no obvious peculiarities in the x - ray morphology , consistent with our pspc data . the cluster , moreover , has no known radio emissions associated with it .    by means of",
    "three pointed pspc observations of this source , taken between may 1992 and may 1993 with a total exposure of about 19,000 seconds , we found a very bright excess emission in pspc s 1/4 kev band ( also known as r2 band , @xmath0 kev ) .",
    "2 shows how detected emission ( light blue , dark blue and black crosses ) compare with the expected emission from the hot intra ",
    "cluster medium ( icm , solid lines ) , e.g. as described by the recent x  ray analysis of kaastra et al .",
    "the three observations were modeled simultaneously , in order to reduce statistical uncertainties .    as extragalactic soft x ",
    "ray emissions are absorbed by the interstellar medium , an accurate measurement of the line - of - sight galactic hydrogen ( hi ) column density ( @xmath1 ) is crucial . the dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) hi maps at resolutions of respectively 1 , 4 and 9 square degrees centered at the cluster s position indicate a region of sky free from spatial hi gradients , with an hi density at the cluster position of 1.79 @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "since galactic infrared 100 @xmath6 m emission correlates well with hi 21-cm radiation ( boulanger and perault 1988 ) , we further consulted _ iras _ 100 @xmath6 m maps ( wheelock et al .",
    "1994 ) at a finer resolution of 3 arcmin .",
    "the 100 @xmath6 m emission is very smooth over the cluster s region , and it confirmed our @xmath1 value for the cluster s galactic hi . this value is henceforth used in the spectral analysis  ) renders this source not easily observable with the nrao 43-mt green bank telescope we employed in our previous analyses . ] .",
    "we refer to a previous paper ( bonamente et al .",
    "2001b ) for the details on pspc data analysis techniques .",
    "spectra of azimuthally averaged annular regions were modelled with a single temperature optically - thin plasma emission .",
    "the galactic absorption was modelled with the codes of morrison and maccammon 1983 ( mm83 ; ` wabs ' in xspec language ) and of wilms , allen and mccray 2000 ( wam00 ; ` tbabs ' in xspec ) .",
    "the he cross - sections of mm83 are in good agreement with the recent compilation by yan , sadeghpour and dalgarno ( 1998 ) , as also shown in a previous paper ( bonamente et al .",
    "the wam00 code provides however the most up - to - date cross - section compilation for absorption of x - rays in the interstellar medium . in the energy range of interest , 0.2 - 0.4 kev , the two codes are nearly indistinguishable at the resolution of the pspc ( see fig . 4 of wam00 ) , and",
    "yielded statistically consistent results , see tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the emission code employed was mekal ( after mewe , gronenschild and van den oord , 1985 ; mewe , lemen and van den oord 1986 ; kaastra 1992 ) .    when applied to the entire passband of the pspc ( 0.2 - 2.0 kev ) , the fit is formally unacceptable ( e.g. , red crosses in fig .",
    "3 ) , and a region of depleted flux ( 0.5 - 1.0 kev ) appears to accompany the 0.2 - 0.4 kev excess .",
    "the fit is satisfactory when applyed only to energies @xmath7 0.5 kev , with the soft excess then abundantly revealed at e@xmath8 0.4 kev ( green crosses , fig .",
    "3 ) . the best - fit parameters of the hot phase agree with the most recent x  ray _ xmm _ observation ( kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ) . in table 1",
    "we summarise the results .",
    "we emphasize that the soft excess emission is so strong that , in order to be interpreted as the low  energy tail of the hot icm emission , a galactic column density as low as 5 - 8 @xmath9 @xmath5 would be required , which is not only severely discrepant from the measured values , but even lower that that of the ` lockman hole ' where @xmath1 reaches global minimum .",
    "the soft emission can not therefore be attributed to peculiarities in the galactic hi distribution .    in figure 4",
    "we show the trend of the pspc excess .",
    "the emission extends to a radius of 800 kiloparsec   km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 is assumed here and after . ]",
    "( = 9 arcmin ) ; in the 912 arcmin region , where only marginal cluster emission is detected ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the data point is consistent with zero flux , thereby confirming the integrity of our background subtraction technique ( bonamente et al .",
    "2001b for reference ) . as comparison",
    ", we note that from the _",
    "xmm_/epic data of kaastra et al .",
    "( 2001 ) evidence for x - ray emission is apparent out to a radial distance of about 10 arcmin , in agreement with our pspc data .",
    "the soft excess emission therefore persists to the x - ray detection limit . to illustrate the significance of the role played by the model uncertanties in our determination of the 1/4 kev contribution from the hot icm , we consider as example the 3 - 6 region .",
    "when the statistical error in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev pspc data ( the portion of the spectra used for model determination ) is taken into account , the error in the fractional eccess increases only from 9 % ( see fig .",
    "4 ) to 10% .",
    "similar conclusions apply to the other regions , indicating that evidence for a soft x - ray component from srsic 159 - 03 is unaffected by statistical uncertanties in the hot icm modelling   could in principle account for a 20 - 30 % excess .",
    "although the relevance of this phenomenon to our srsic 159 - 03 observations is uncertain , the strength of the pspc excess here reported largely exceeds that figure . on occasions where comparison with stellar lyman-@xmath11 and quasar x - ray spectra could be made , the agreement among the different methods of determining @xmath1 would suggest an error less than @xmath12 @xmath5 ( see lieu et al .",
    "1996b and references therein ) . ]",
    "how do we interpret such a strong signal ?",
    "a ` warm ' , optically  thin phase of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) at sub - megakelvin temperatures can in principle accont for the excess emission .",
    "thermal conduction can be suppressed , either for the presence of tangled magnetic fields ( chandran et al .",
    "1999 ) or if the warm phase is sufficiently ` clumpy ' ( cowie and mckee 1977 ; smith and lilliequist 1979 ) , yet the time scale for radiative losses of a ` warm ' gas is sufficiently short to necessitate rapid and continuous replenishment ( such as that of the ` mixing layers ' scenario of fabian 1997 ) , if the warm phase existed in a steady state for cosmological times . in the neighborhood of t @xmath13 k ,",
    "the cooling time of a gas with solar abundances is @xmath14 years , where @xmath15 is gas density in units of @xmath16 @xmath17 ( landini and monsignori - fossi 1990 ) , the characteristic density of the warm phase in the 1 - 3 and 3 - 6 regions for a volume filling factor @xmath18 ( 0 @xmath19 @xmath20 1 ) .",
    "our observations however determine the so called _ emission measure _ of the warm phase ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the volume of the emitting gas ) , and @xmath23 remains unknown . for",
    "a given detected @xmath24 , the total warm gas mass @xmath25 in a given region is a function of @xmath23 , @xmath26 ; as the density increases with decreasing @xmath23 ( @xmath27 ) , the cooling time accordingly decreases as @xmath28 .",
    "the mass implications are very demanding : this new component will have a mass comparable to that of the hot icm , see table 2 , and those budgets can be alleviated if @xmath23 is very small , however at the price of a correspondingly shorter cooling time .",
    "alternatively , an inverse compton ( ic ) origin of the emission can be advocated ( sarazin and lieu 1998 ) .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration ( axford et al . 1977 ; bell 1978a , b ; blandford and ostriker 1978 ) may be responsible for a population of relativistic electrons with a power - law spectrum in the icm , and its ic mechanism preserves a similar power - law shape , whereby the two differential number distributions of electrons ( n(e)@xmath29 ) and emitted photons ( l@xmath30 ) are related by the equation @xmath31 .",
    "relativistic electrons of @xmath32 = 300 - 700 , required to emit euv or soft x  ray through ic scattering , straddle spectrally between low ",
    "energy coulomb losses and high  energy radiative losses ( lieu et al .",
    "1999 ; sarazin 1999 ) , and may survive for a significant fraction of a cluster s lifetime . here",
    "we fit the photon index @xmath11 to the data , table 2 , with the exception of the 3 - 6 arcmin region where @xmath11 it is fixed at @xmath11=1.75 , the expected value from a cosmic ray ( cr ) population of @xmath6=2.5 in accordance to galactic cr .",
    "the modelling is formally acceptable , although with a spectral index somewhat steeper than that of galactic cr .",
    "however , serious problems confront the energetic requirements of the ic model : the pressure of cr electrons with @xmath32 in the range 475700 ( those which emit ic radiation in the e=0.2 - 0.4 kev band ) exceeds that of the hot icm by a factor of order 2 - 3 ! moreover , this pressure estimate is necessarily a lower limit , as higher and lower  energy electrons may be present , as well as cr ions which , although not visible , will further drive the cr budget to absurde values ( lieu et al . 1999",
    "; see also miniati et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "as often happens in rich clusters of galaxies , the x  ray centroid , here coincident with the central cd galaxy eso 291 - 9 , is associated with a lower temperature for the hot icm ( kaastra et al .",
    "such a temperature decrease is also clearly visible in our pspc data . yet",
    "the detected soft x ",
    "ray excess can not be directly related to it : firstly , because the excess covers an area about 25 times larger than the region affected by this ` cooling ' ( which has a radius of about 1.8 arcmin , kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ; allen and fabian 1997 ) ; secondly , and more importantly , because we already accounted for the effect in our data modeling ( see best  fit temperatures in table 1 ) .",
    "the behaviour here is therefore analogous to , e.g. , that of the virgo and a1795 clusters , where the excess emission spreads over a much larger area than that of the central cooler region ( lieu et al .",
    "1996a ; bonamente et al .",
    "2001a ) . the central galaxy of srsic 159 - 03 , which also contains an ir source , is well contained within a radius of 1 arcmin ( hansen et al .",
    "2000 ) : the soft excess emission must then be a genuinely cluster  wide phenomenon .",
    "the high statistical significance of the soft excess emission of this cluster confounds both thermal and non - thermal models , table 2 .",
    "either model can fit the data , and calls for an overhaul in our understanding of galaxy clusters .    following the non - thermal interpretation ,",
    "the large pressure budgets of table 2 can not easily be mitigated ; on the contrary , they are strict lower limits to the relativistic particle content in the cluster .",
    "the presence of a population of relativistic particles _ above _ equipartition with the hot gas clearly has implications on a cluster s hydrostatic balance ( e.g. , berezinsky et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the role of intra - cluster cr on the cluster s evolution ( e.g. , heating of the icm gas ) could be much more significant than previously thought . at present",
    "it is not known whether strong shocks , e.g. , those induced by cluster mergers , may accelerate such a large amount of crs .",
    "it is possible that the cluster experiences many such shocks throughout its lifetime ; the icm would then accumulate those cr electrons with the longest radiative life time , precisely the @xmath33 300 - 500 electrons which emit in euv and soft x - rays through ic scattering ( sarazin and lieu 1998 ; lieu et al .",
    "1999 ) .    on the other hand , large warm gas masses could be sustained at the interface of cold gas clouds and the hot icm ( fabian 1997 ) , the presence of a ` cold ' ( t @xmath34 k ) phase in the icm is in fact an interpretation of the pspc images of the coma and virgo clusters ( bonamente et al .",
    "2001c ) . in the absence of such a replenishment mechanism",
    ", however , the very short radiative cooling time renders the thermal model untenable .",
    "the bright soft excess of srsic 159 - 03 here reported presents a new and unavoidable reality : whether the ultimate explanation be thermal , non - thermal or some other origin , a major effect at work in the intergalactic medium has hiterto been completely ignored .",

    "<S> our analysis of _ rosat _ pspc observations reveal that the _ soft excess _ can be interpreted as either a thermal or non - thermal effect , and the high data quality allows to place tight constraints on the two currently competing models . </S>",
    "<S> however , each model now implies major revisions to our understanding of clusters of galaxies : either ` warm ' gas masses in similar amounts to the hot gas , or relativistic particles in or above equipartition with the hot phase , appear to be unavoidable . </S>"
