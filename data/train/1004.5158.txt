    "block copolymers are polymeric materials with specific chain architecture in which several blocks of different chemical nature are linked covalently .",
    "the simplest design is that of a di - block in which two polymeric blocks , a and b , are connected . even in this design",
    "the system manifests a rich phase structure of self - assembled periodic arrays of spheres , cylinders , or planes , which has many applications such as templates for nanoscopic devices @xcite .",
    "one difficulty which must be overcome before block copolymer arrays can be exploited is the fact that , when produced as a thin film , the array tends to align with the substrate due to preferential interactions between it and one of the polymer blocks . in many applications ,",
    "however , the desired orientation is one in which the ordered structure is aligned perpendicular to a substrate . for example , if a cylindrical array is aligned perpendicularly , then the cylinder cores can be etched away and replaced by a metal .",
    "further removal of the material surrounding the cores produces an array of wires useful for sensors @xcite .",
    "one method to bring about this orientation is to subject the film to an electric field @xcite , a technique which takes advantage of the difference in dielectric constants between the two polymer blocks .",
    "because the electric field needed to produce the desired orientation can be rather high , on the order of @xmath0v/@xmath1 m , it can happen that the material undergoes dielectric breakdown before alignment is achieved . as a way of lowering the electric field needed for alignment , tsori et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that one could introduce free ions into the system .",
    "presumably if the ions were preferentially soluble in one of the blocks , the induced dipole moment of that block would become much larger in the perpendicular orientation .",
    "the increase in polarization would bring about the desired decrease in the electric field needed for alignment .",
    "this procedure has been utilized experimentally and the desired increase in orientation obtained for a given applied field @xcite . in spite of this success , it is not completely clear how the addition of ions brings about the desired result .",
    "it has been argued that instead of increasing the induced dipole moment , large amounts of added ions introduced in one of the two blocks simply change the respective dielectric constant@xcite . a different argument @xcite is that the addition of large amounts of ions changes the strength of the interaction between the different monomers even in the absence of an external field . in support of this latter suggestion ,",
    "introduction of ions has been shown to affect the phase behavior of block copolymers , behavior which scales with this interaction strength @xcite .    to elucidate the origin of free ",
    "ion effects in block - copolymer systems , we have considered the effect of free ions on a system which is simpler , but which shares its mesoscopic periodic morphology . our model system is a rigid stack of alternating a / b lamellae . the entire stack is confined between two external flat electrodes .",
    "the a and b lamellae are characterized by two dielectric constants , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "free ions are then introduced into the a layers .",
    "it is assumed , arbitrarily , that the positive charges are immobile and distributed uniformly throughout the a layers , creating a uniform charged background , while the negative counterions are mobile throughout the a regions .",
    "an interchange of the role of positive and negative charges will have no effect on the results of our calculation .",
    "the fraction of ions dissolved in the two kinds of layers is , in general , different , and we consider the case of greatest contrast in which there are no charges in the b lamellae .",
    "we calculate , within mean - field theory , the system free - energy in the presence of a voltage @xmath4 applied across the plates .",
    "the free energy depends , of course , upon the relative orientation of lamellae and electric field .",
    "our results for the critical reorienting electric field depend strongly upon the location of the counterions .",
    "if they are confined to the a lamellae such that each is electrically neutral , then separation of charge occurs only over distances of the order of the thickness of the a lamellae when the lamellae are parallel to the substrate .",
    "in contrast , the charges can be separated over lengths of the order of the entire film thickness when lamellae are oriented perpendicularly .",
    "hence , the latter configuration is favored , and the desired orientation can be brought about with an electric field significantly weaker than that needed without ions . however ,",
    "if the counterions are free to move between different a lamellae , then the separation of charge occurs over distances of the order of the sample thickness in both orientations , so that the system behavior is not easily predicted . in this case ,",
    "our results show that there is a smaller reduction of the field needed to reorient the sample , and that the magnitude of the reduction depends upon whether the surface interactions prefer the a component , whose lamellae contain ions , or the b component . the effect is larger if the surface interactions prefer the b component .",
    "if they prefer the a component , we find that the introduction of ions can even stabilize the parallel orientation .",
    "we consider a system , of volume @xmath5 , consisting of alternating layers of materials denoted a and b with dielectric constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "all layers but the two closest to the two surfaces ( chosen arbitrarily to be b layers ) are of equal thickness @xmath6 so that the structural periodicity is @xmath7 .",
    "the two layers adjacent to the plate electrodes are each of thickness @xmath8 , as they would be in a system of unstrained lamellar block copolymer .",
    "the material fills the space between two plates , which are parallel to the ( @xmath9 ) plane , one at @xmath10 at which @xmath11 , the other at @xmath12 at which @xmath13 each plate is of area @xmath14 . just as in the experiments",
    ", there is a thin insulating layer between the plates and the material , keeping the total amount of ions in between the two plates fixed .",
    "we assume the system contains @xmath15 immobile , monovalent , cations distributed with uniform density @xmath16 in the a lamellae , and zero density within the b lamellae .",
    "the counterions are also monovalent and assumed to be mobile with a non - zero number density , @xmath17 , only within the a lamellae ; there are no counterions in the b lamellae , and the entire lamellar system is electrically neutral .    the maxwell equations which govern this electrostatic system with linear dielectric materials are , within the si system , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the unit of charge .",
    "the first equation is satisfied identically by introducing the electrostatic potential @xmath20 such that @xmath21 with this the remaining maxwell equation takes the form    @xmath22    in our model system , the number density of positive charges within the a lamellae is constant , @xmath23 , and the dielectric constant @xmath24 , a constant , so that eq .",

    "once the solutions for the charge density and potential are determined , the free energy of the system can be obtained .",
    "it is convenient to display explicitly the contribution to it from the surface fields and to write the total free energy as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total area of the two plates in contact with the a region and similarly for @xmath37 ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the interfacial free energies per unit area between the plates and a and b regions , respectively ; @xmath40    for convenience , we remind the reader in appendix i of the result for the electrostatic energy of the system when the plates are held at a fixed potential difference . with the energy in hand , the mean - field expression for the electrostatic part of the free energy can be derived in various ways @xcite with the result @xmath41 the free energy is proportional to the area of each plate , so it is convenient to consider the free energy per unit area .",
    "we choose to measure the free energy per area in units of @xmath42 .",

    "we consider two different constraints on the location of the mobile counterions . in the first , we assume that the counterions are not free to move between a lamellae .",
    "their distribution is such that _ each _ a lamella is electrically neutral .",
    "we refer to this as _",
    "local neutrality_. the other possibility we consider is that the counterions , while found only in the a lamellae as before , are distributed among them subject only to the weaker constraint that the system is _ overall _ neutral .",

    "the simplest of these is a dimensionless applied potential , @xmath46 @xmath47 as typical potentials across the film are a few volts to a few dozens volts , this parameter is large , on the order of @xmath48 for experiments at room temperature .",
    "a dimensionless measure , @xmath49 , of the ionic number density @xmath16 is readily defined @xmath50 and is easily seen to be the ratio of the system thickness @xmath51 to the debye length , @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54^{1/2}.\\ ] ] thus , small values of @xmath49 imply weak screening of the electric field by the counterions , while large values of @xmath49 imply strong screening .",

    "it is clear that in this case a dipole moment scaling with the distance between plates can only be obtained when the lamellae are oriented perpendicular to the plates .",
    "thus , the applied field will favor this orientation , and we expect the critical field needed to bring it about will be reduced by the presence of the free ions .",
    "we examine a system in which the wavelength of the lamellar structure is @xmath92 because the effect of the ions is more easily seen in thin films .",

    "deviation from this linear behavior is expected .",

    "each a lamella will now exhibit a non - zero charge density profile that is a function of the distance to the plates .",

    "is increased , the charges are free to migrate towards the bounding electrodes and to concentrate at the surfaces of the lamellae .",

    "[ rhoglobal ] that , for large charge densities , @xmath105 , the mobile negative charges are essentially depleted from the lamellae close to the negatively charged plate leaving behind a positive charge density with dimensionless value equal to @xmath105 .",

    "the electric field becomes increasingly screened , an effect most pronounced deep in the interior of the system and which spreads toward the two electrodes with increasing charge density .",
    "this is not difficult to understand .",
    "if one groups the layers of opposite charge in nesting pairs , with the outermost pair being at @xmath106 and @xmath107 , then the system resembles a set of nested capacitors , of alternating polarity , in series . as each capacitor contributes almost no field outside of its plates , the electric field can only be large near the two bounding surfaces of the entire system . in the limit of very large densities ,",
    "it is clear that the charge is concentrated in the a lamella nearest the plates , and the field and associated potential drop is only significant in the b layers adjacent to the plates .      for the case in which the lamellae are perpendicular to the plates",
    ", we must solve the poisson - boltzmann equations in two dimensions .",
    "because of periodicity and symmetry , it is sufficient to solve them only in an area of length @xmath51 in the @xmath108 direction and of length @xmath6 in the @xmath109 direction , from the middle of one a lamella to the middle of the adjoining b. equipotential contours are shown in fig .",

    "one sees immediately that there is little variation of the electric field from a to b regions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lamellae are quite narrow compared to their height .",
    "but one also notices that the equipotentials are very different from the equally spaced ones which would characterize the potential in the absence of ions . because the top , positive potential , plate attracts the negative mobile counterions , the electric field is screened effectively near it and the potential changes slowly",
    "; most of the change in potential occurs near the bottom plate .    as the density of free ions",
    "is increased , the @xmath110 lamellae act more and more like conductors , screening their interiors from the external electric field , just as in the parallel orientation .",
    "but in the perpendicular orientation , they provide a direct path between capacitor plates with the consequences that the external voltage source must place an increasing amount of charge on the plates in order to establish the requisite potential difference , and must expend ever more energy in order to do so .      with the solution of the poisson - boltzmann equations in hand for the two configurations , the corresponding free energies can be evaluated for any given external voltage , and in particular for voltages at which the perpendicular orientation of lamellae becomes of lower free energy than the parallel configuration .",
    "we calculate the free energies per unit area @xmath111 and @xmath112 for these two configurations and define @xmath113 further we note that in the perpendicular configuration @xmath114 because we have assumed that the a and b lamellae are of equal thickness .",
    "we assume that the surface fields cause the plates to prefer the less - polar polymer comprising the b lamellae , as in the experiments of xu et al .",

    "results for four different values of @xmath105 , the dimensionless density of the mobile ions , are shown .",

    "this reduction in critical voltage comes from the fact that the counterions do little to lower the electrostatic energy of the system when the lamellae are parallel to the substrate as well as locally neutral . in this case",
    ", there is no separation of charge on the order of the film thickness .",
    "but the ions do a great deal to lower the free energy when the lamellae are perpendicular to the plates so that there is a separation of charge on the order of the film thickness .",
    "of course , this separation of charge decreases the entropy and is therefore opposed by thermal effects . in order to determine whether a reorientation will result from the two competing effects",
    ", one must carry out the calculation explicitly , as we have done , taking into account both the decrease of the free energy due to the reduction in electrostatic energy and the increase in free energy due to the decrease in counterion entropy .",
    "as the charge density increases without limit , the free energy of the perpendicular orientation at any non - zero voltage decreases without limit so that the curves of free energy difference approach the ordinate of fig .",
    "8 , and the voltage needed to bring about reorientation approaches zero .",
    "we next consider the less restrictive case when the system is globally neutral . the free energy difference between perpendicular and parallel orientations",

    "[ deltafglobal ] .",
    "again there is a reduction in the voltage needed to reorient the lamellae , from @xmath137 ( @xmath138 , or no ions ) to @xmath139 for @xmath98 .",
    "this is a much smaller reduction than in the locally neutral case for which the reorienting potential was driven down to @xmath140 for @xmath98 .",
    "the reason that there is _ any _ reduction in the reorienting voltage in the globally neutral case is subtle for there is a macroscopic separation of charge in _ both _ orientations .",
    "however , while the charge in the perpendicular alignment can be separated by a distance @xmath51 , in the parallel alignment it can only be separated by a smaller distance @xmath141 when the b layer is next to the plates .",
    "hence , the ions lower the free energy of the perpendicular configuration more than that of the parallel one with a consequent reduction in critical voltage .",
    "because the difference between charge separations of @xmath51 and @xmath141 is relatively larger the smaller the value of @xmath51 , we expect that the relative reduction of the potential needed to reorient the film is greater for thinner films .",
    "we have verified this conclusion by calculating results for films in which @xmath51 was reduced to 4@xmath7 . whereas in the @xmath142 film",
    "there is a reduction in the reorientation potential of about @xmath143% when the dimensionless surface field is equal to 100 and the density of ions is @xmath98 , in the thinner film the reduction for the same surface field and ion density is about @xmath144% .",
    "were the a material preferentially adsorbed to the plates , there would be a macroscopic separation of charge of order @xmath51 in both orientations .",
    "in fact , the polarization would be somewhat larger in the parallel orientation in which the free charges could coat the plates entirely as contrasted with the perpendicular configuration in which they could coat only half the area of the plates .",
    "thus we would expect that the addition of ions actually enhances the parallel orientation with respect to the perpendicular and would cause the critical voltage to _ increase _ rather than decrease .",
    "we have verified that this is indeed the case , although the increase in critical voltage is not large .",
    "we also expect the effective surface tension of the a block with the substrate to be reduced by an amount @xmath145 . this expression is identical to the reduction of the liquid - solid interfacial tension of polar liquids in external potentials ( electrowetting ) @xcite .",
    "we have considered a system composed of lamellae with two different dielectric constants and in which one kind , the a lamellae , contain mobile negative ions in a smeared continuum background of positive ones .",
    "we calculated the effect of these ions on the free energy when the lamellae are oriented in the direction of the applied field and compared it to that when the lamellae are oriented parallel to the two external electrodes , which is the orientation favored by surface interactions .",
    "we have assumed that the system is in thermal equilibrium so that the comparison of these free energies determines the magnitude of the applied voltage necessary to bring about the reorientation of the lamellae .",
    "the effect of the ions can be quite significant , but we have shown that it depends on several factors .",
    "the ions have their largest effect if the system is locally neutral , _",
    "i.e. _ they neutralize the background charge of each of the a lamellae of the film . in that case , a macroscopic separation of charge , with its concomitant lowering of energy , can only be brought about if the lamellae undergo the desired reorientation .",
    "we find that for the surface interactions commonly encountered , the voltage needed to bring about the reorientation could be reduced by more than half .",
    "these results are in fine qualitative agreement with the experiments of kohn et al .",
    "@xcite whose system was one of local neutrality . by applying alternating electric fields at various frequencies , they could explicity determine the effect of the free ions as contrasted with those originating from the different dielectric constants .",
    "they indeed found that at lower frequencies at which the effects of the free ions become important , the orienting effect of the electric field was enhanced @xcite .    for systems in which the mobile ions can move from one a lamella to another so that it is only restricted to be globally neutral ,",
    "the effect of the ions is predicted to be smaller than in the locally neutral case , and to depend on other factors as well . in particular ,",
    "if the system is globally neutral , we predict that the effect is greater if the surface interactions prefer the b ( no ions ) lamellae , for then the separation of charge in the perpendicular orientation is larger than that in the parallel one .",
    "the relative reduction in the reorienting potential should be the greater the thinner the film .",
    "if the surface interactions prefer the a layers , then the presence of ions can actually increase the voltage needed to bring about the reorientation .",
    "insight into the question of whether the lamellae of a particular system are locally or globally neutral can be obtained by altering the plates so that they prefer a in one experiment and b in another .",
    "a locally neutral system will be relatively unaffected by such a change , while a globally neutral one would be significantly changed .",
    "an alternative is to solubilize a known amount of ions in the pure polymers .",
    "integration of the current that passes through the polymer at a given external potential allows one to infer the fraction of immobile ions and the solubilization energy .",
    "we have noted that separation of charge which occurs on the scale of the film thickness decreases the entropy making reorientation more difficult .",
    "hence a reduction of temperature certainly makes it easier to bring about the reorientation . in our calculation , this is reflected in the definition of the dimensionless measure @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ rr ] ) , which shows that a decrease in temperature is equivalent to an increase in ionic charge density .    at constant temperature ,",
