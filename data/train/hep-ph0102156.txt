    "weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite provides a highly motivated framework for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the hunt for the predicted supersymmetric matter is one of the primary tasks for collider experiments in the 21st century .",
    "the details of superparticle signatures are model - dependent , and may shed light on the mechanism for the communication of supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector consisting of sm particles and their superpartners .",
    "an elegant approach is to assume supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in a `` hidden sector '' , and that supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the observable sector via gravitational interactions@xcite .",
    "most generally , in these supergravity models , soft susy breaking ( ssb ) scalar mass parameters are flavor dependent@xcite , and lead to violation of experimental limits on flavor changing ( and possibly also cp violating ) phenomena @xcite .",
    "generic predictions for cp violating , but flavor conserving , quantities such as the electric dipole moments of the electron or the neutron also violate experimental upper limits on their values .",
    "these are the well known susy flavor and cp problems .",
    "the proposal of _ universality _ of scalar masses solves the susy flavor problem , but is not a direct consequence of supergravity models .",
    "even if universality can be arranged at tree level , quantum corrections will lift the degeneracy , and lead back to problems in the flavor and cp sectors of the theory@xcite .",
    "problems with flavor conserving , but cp violating , observables arise because new phases are possible in susy theories .",
    "these problems are ameliorated if the associated ( combination of ) phases are small , or if sparticles are sufficiently heavy .    over the years",
    ", considerable effort has been spent on the search for novel susy breaking schemes which are consistent with fcnc and cp violating processes .",
    "three prominent classes of models include gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb)@xcite , anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb)@xcite and gaugino - mediated susy breaking@xcite .",
    "each of these models must introduce additional visible sector fields and/or extra dimensions , unlike the case with gravity - mediated susy breaking models . in these frameworks ,",
    "the flavor problem is solved because particles with the same gauge quantum numbers are degenerate , but the cp problem may remain .    a different solution to the susy flavor problem in four dimensional supergravity theories is _",
    "decoupling_@xcite , where the superpartner masses ( for the first two generations ) are raised to such high values that fcnc and cp violating processes are strongly suppressed .",
    "naively , this solution conflicts with naturalness considerations@xcite : the susy flavor and cp problems demand multi - tev scalar masses , while naturalness prefers sub - tev susy breaking masses .",
    "a proposal which reconciles these requirements is to arrange for an _ inverted mass hierarchy _ ( imh ) for scalars in the theory : multi - tev masses for first and second generation scalars , but sub - tev masses for third generation and higgs scalars@xcite .",
    "if the imh of scalars already exists at the gut scale ( gsimh models ) , then it has been emphasized that two - loop contributions to the renormalization group evolution of soft susy breaking scalar masses can cause a breakdown in color and/or electric charge symmetry unless the gut scale top squark mass is sufficiently large@xcite .",
    "indeed one can generate viable gsimh models@xcite only over limited portions of model parameter space .",
    "the task then would be to explain the origin of the peculiar choice of ssb parameters at the gut scale",
    ".    an attractive alternative has recently been suggested , and developed , in a series of papers@xcite .",
    "the idea is to start with multi - tev masses for _ all _ scalar fields at the gut / planck scale , and to generate the imh _ radiatively _ ( rimh ) . neglecting sub - tev contributions to the renormalization group equations ( rge ) , and assuming yukawa couplings and",
    "also @xmath6 parameters remain unified at all mass scales , the one loop rges for the third generation plus higgs scalar ssb masses can be solved explicitly .",
    "remarkably , for simple forms of gut scale boundary conditions that are consistent with @xmath0 grand unification , yukawa couplings rapidly drive third generation ssb and higgs boson masses towards zero at the weak scale , while the first and second generation scalars ( which have negligible yukawa couplings ) remain in the multi - tev range . the contribution from the evolution of the gauge singlet",
    "right handed neutrino ( rhn ) superfield @xmath7 that occurs in @xmath0 unified theories plays a crucial role . a crunch factor @xmath8",
    " essentially the average of first generation squared scalar masses compared to third generation ones  was defined . using gut scale yukawa couplings of @xmath9 , and scale choices @xmath10 gev at which the rhn decouples from the mssm , crunch factors of @xmath11 were claimed . as an example",
    ", a crunch factor @xmath12 would imply that 10 tev first and second generation scalars could co - exist with 0.5 tev third generation scalars at the weak scale .",
    "a number of problems arise if one attempts a realistic implementation of the rimh model .",
    "the first , as noted also by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , is that for models with large @xmath13 , which is where yukawa coupling unification occurs , it is difficult to generate a radiative breakdown in electroweak symmetry ( rewsb ) .",
    "the second , as we will see below , is that for model parameters which lead to large values of @xmath8 , the experimental values for third generation fermion masses are not obtained .",
    "a third problem occurs in a full implementation of the renormalization group solution to the rimh model .",
    "the neglected sub - tev mass contributions , two - loop rge contributions , and non - universal yukawa couplings and @xmath6 parameters below the gut scale all serve to perturb the simple solutions found in ref .",
    "@xcite , generally resulting in a considerable diminution of the crunch factors that can be obtained .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the problem of implementing rewsb in yukawa unified @xmath0 models can be solved by including allowed @xmath1-term contributions to scalar field masses : these occur when spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking leads to a reduction in rank of the gauge group@xcite .",
    "the form of the @xmath0 @xmath1-terms allows for a split in the gut scale higgs masses so that @xmath14 which , in turn , facilitates rewsb .",
    "the @xmath1-terms also affect other scalar masses , resulting in a sparticle mass spectrum where the bottom squark @xmath15 is frequently the lightest of all the matter scalars , and left- sleptons are lighter than right- sleptons , as opposed to the situation in the msugra model , with gut scale universality@xcite .    in a recent paper@xcite",
    ", it was shown that @xmath0 @xmath1-terms could rescue rewsb into the rimh framework as well , so that sparticle masses could be explicitly calculated . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a bottom up approach was used to calculate the values of gut scale yukawa couplings , and the gut scale ssb boundary conditions identified in ref .",
    "@xcite were adopted .",
    "the sub - tev contributions to rges were also included .",
    "the crunch factors obtained , however , were in the range @xmath16 , much smaller than the values found previously@xcite . in this paper , we perform a more detailed analysis of rimh models .",
    "we have two main goals .",
    "first , we seek a realistic implementation of rimh models , keeping track of sub - tev and two - loop contributions to rg evolution , requiring appropriate values of third generation fermion masses , and requiring a radiative breakdown in electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "we find it possible to construct realistic rimh models , but with crunch factors @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we conclude that realistic rimh models give only a partial solution to the susy flavor and cp problems",
    ". the rimh model , coupled with a limited degree of non - universality of soft breaking scalar masses or alignment of fermion and sfermion matrices may be enough to obtain a complete solution .",
    "once realistic susy particle mass spectra can be calculated within the rimh model context , our second goal is to examine various phenomenological implications of these models , including the neutralino relic density , @xmath18 decay rates , and expectations for collider searches .    toward these ends , we upgrade the supersymmetric rg solution used in isajet to include the complete set of two - loop rges for both the mssm and mssm+rhn models . as first shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , multi - tev two loop contributions can potentially be as large as sub - tev leading order contributions to the rges . in sec .",
    "ii_a _ , we first re - analyze rimh models using a bottom - up approach to the susy rg solution .",
    "the bottom - up approach guarantees solutions with correct third generation fermion masses . allowing more flexibility in the value of @xmath19 allows somewhat greater values ( compared to ref .",
    "@xcite ) of @xmath20 to be obtained .",
    "these @xmath8 values are far below the values of @xmath8 claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite . to understand this , in sec .",
    "ii_b _ , we repeat much of our analysis using a top - down rge approach . in this case , large gut scale yukawa couplings can be used .",
    "we find then that a significantly larger imh mass gap , with @xmath21 can be obtained .",
    "however , in this case the third generation fermion masses do not match their measured values .",
    "in particular , the fixed point prediction of the value of @xmath22 is quite far from its experimental value .",
    "the remainder of the paper focuses upon the phenomenological implications of the model . in sec .",
    "iii , we attempt to systematize the parameter space explored in sec .",
    "ii , and show plots of sparticle masses versus model parameters . in sec .",
    "iv , we present our predictions for the cosmological neutralino relic density , while those for the branching ratio of the @xmath18 decay are shown in sec .",
    "v. finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we show the reach of the fermilab tevatron and cern lhc for rimh models . in spite of the decoupling solution with multi - tev first and second generation scalars ,",
    "a considerable reach is obtained at the cern lhc , corresponding to values of @xmath23 gev , assuming just 10 fb@xmath5 of integrated luminosity .",

    "the qualitative behaviour of the weak scale ssb masses can be obtained by neglecting the splitting between the third generation yukawa couplings and @xmath6 parameters that arises from renormalization group running .",

    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath34 are non - negative , with the largest eigenvalue @xmath36 .",
    "components of the initial conditions along this direction are strongly suppressed by renormalization group evolution to the weak scale : the corresponding eigenvector suggests that the ssb masses should be related as @xmath37 at the gut scale .",
    "this condition is consistent with minimal @xmath0 unification . plugging the eigenvector @xmath38 and eigenvalue @xmath39 into ( [ eq : bfp2 ] )",

    "first and second generation scalars have only tiny yukawa couplings , and hence , their masses are essentially unchanged by the evolution between the gut and weak scales .",
    "this is the basic mechanism for the radiative generation of the imh . the singlet neutrino superfield @xmath40 , which is automatically present in @xmath0 susy gut models is critical for this mechanism to work .    in our examination of the rimh model ,",

    "the rimh solution can be obtained for either sign of @xmath110 ; solutions with negative @xmath110 tend to lead to a somewhat larger hierarchy . to analyze the phenomenological implications of rimh models , we have selected two slices of the parameter space which yield large @xmath8 , one for each sign of @xmath110 .",

    "this is because sparticles are heavy so that the lsp annihilation cross sections are generally suppressed .",
    "the relic density prediction falls close to or within the experimentally favoured region for models characterized by either a very light bottom squark ( @xmath183 ) , or by a lightest neutralino in the transition region between being bino - like and higgsino - like ( both signs of @xmath110 ) .",

    "we note , however , that the branching fraction is @xmath290% larger than this upper limit as long @xmath291  gev .",
    "since it is possible that other effects ( squark mixing , susy phases ) may modify the calculation of this branching ratio , it may be worthwhile to exercise some caution before definitively ruling out these scenarios",

    "unfortunately , this range is conclusively excluded by the relic density constraints , assuming that the lsp is absolutely stable ( as it is within our framework ) .",
    "combining the constraints from the @xmath18 decay with those from the relic density , we see that values of @xmath293  gev and @xmath294 might lead to the most viable of these large @xmath8 scenarios .",
    "finally , in the previous section , we have examined some consequences of rimh models for collider searches . for the fermilab tevatron ,",
    "only very small regions of model parameter space could be accessed via direct searches for bottom squark pair production . at the cern lhc collider , the limited imh obtained means that a complete decoupling of heavier states does not take place , in contrast to what happens@xcite in gsimh models . by searching for @xmath295 events with at least two tagged @xmath271-jets , values of @xmath23 gev",
