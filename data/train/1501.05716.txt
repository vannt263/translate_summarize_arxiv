    "in this paper , we consider the following problem @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are positive constants , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a nonnegative @xmath36 function with support in @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 is a @xmath39 function satisfying @xmath40    the problem is used to model the spreading of a new or invasive species , under the influence of diffusion and advection .",
    "the unknown @xmath41 denotes the population density over a one dimensional habitat and the free boundaries @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the expanding fronts of the species .",
    "we assume that the free boundaries move according to one - phase stefan condition , which is a kind of free boundary conditions widely used in the study of melting of ice @xcite , wound healing @xcite , and population dynamics @xcite .",
    "the derivation of one - phase or two - phase stefan conditions in population models as singular limits of competition - diffusion systems can be found in @xcite etc .",
    "when @xmath44 ( i.e. , there is no advection in the environment ) , the qualitative properties of the problem was studied by du and lin @xcite for logistic nonlinearity @xmath45 . among others , they proved that , when @xmath46 , any solution of with @xmath44 grows up and converges to @xmath47 ( which is called _ spreading _ phenomena ) ; when @xmath48 , spreading happens if @xmath32 is large and _ vanishing _ happens if @xmath32 is small ( i.e. , the solution converges to @xmath49 ) .",
    "the vanishing phenomena is a remarkable result since it shows that the presence of free boundaries may avoid the so - called _ hair - trigger effect _ ,",
    "which is a phenomena shown in @xcite : spreading always happens for a solution of the cauchy problem for @xmath50 , no matter how small the positive initial data is .",
    "recently , du and lou @xcite extended the results in @xcite to the problem with general monostable , bistable and combustion types of @xmath51 , and gave a rather complete description on the long time behavior of the solutions .",
    "in addition , kaneko and yamada @xcite , liu and lou @xcite studied the problem with @xmath44 and with a fixed boundary @xmath52 , du and guo @xcite , du , matano and wang @xcite , zhou and xiao @xcite , wang @xcite studied the problem ( without advection ) in higher dimension spaces and/or in spatial heterogeneous environments . besides the qualitative properties , another interesting problem is the asymptotic spreading speeds of the free boundaries when spreading happens .",
    "du and lin @xcite , du and lou @xcite proved that , when spreading happens for a solution @xmath53 of the problem with @xmath44 , @xmath54 recently , du , matsuzawa and zhou @xcite improved this result to better ones : @xmath55 = c^*,\\quad \\lim_{t\\to \\infty } [ h(t)- c^ * t ] = h_\\infty,\\quad \\lim_{t\\to \\infty } [ g(t)+ c^ * t ] = g_\\infty,\\ ] ] for some @xmath56 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem with @xmath57 , which means that the spreading of a species is affected by advection . in the field of ecology",
    ", organisms can often sense and respond to local environmental cues by moving towards favorable habitats , and these movement usually depend upon a combination of local biotic and abiotic factors such as stream , climate , food and predators . for example , some diseases spread along the wind direction . in 2009 ,",
    "maidana and yang @xcite studied the propagation of west nile virus from new york city to california state .",
    "it was observed that west nile virus appeared for the first time in new york city in the summer of 1999 . in the second year",
    "the wave front travels 187 km to the north and 1100 km to the south .",
    "therefore , they took account of the advection movement and showed that bird advection becomes an important factor for lower mosquito biting rates .",
    "another example is that averill @xcite considered the effect of intermediate advection on the dynamics of two - species competition system , and provided a concrete range of advection strength for the coexistence of two competing species .",
    "moreover , three different kinds of transitions from small advection to large advection were illustrated theoretically and numerically .",
    "many other examples involving advection can also be found in the field of ecology ( cf .",
    "@xcite etc . ) .    from a mathematical point of view , to involve the influence of advection , one of the simplest but probably still realistic approaches is to assume that species can move up along the gradient of the density , as considered in @xcite etc .",
    "gu , lin and lou @xcite studied the problem with small advection .",
    "they proved a spreading - vanishing dichotomy result on the long time behavior of positive solutions of , which is similar as the conclusions in @xcite for equations without advection .",
    "they also proved that , when spreading happens for a solution of with small advection , its rightward spreading speed is bigger than the leftward one : @xmath58 recently , kaneko and matsuzawa @xcite improved this result to some conclusions like .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to study the influence of the advection term @xmath59 on the long time behavior of solutions of .",
    "as we will see below , our study improves the results in @xcite since we will study the problem for all @xmath57 , not only for small @xmath33 .",
    "especially , when @xmath33 is large , the phenomena is much more complicated and more interesting than the case where @xmath33 is small .",
    "we point that the problem for the equations with bistable type of nonlinearity , or the problems ( with monostable or bistable type of nonlinearity ) in the interval @xmath60 $ ] with @xmath43 a free boundary and @xmath61 a fixed boundary where @xmath62 satisfies a general robin boundary condition can be considered similarly .",
    "in fact , in our forthcoming papers @xcite we study these problems and obtain similar results as in this paper .    to sketch the influence of @xmath33 , we introduce two important traveling waves .",
    "first , consider the following problem @xmath63 it is well known that this problem has a solution @xmath64 if and only if @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is called the minimal speed of the traveling waves of fisher - kpp equation . denote @xmath67 , then @xmath68 is a traveling wave of @xmath69 .",
    "it travels leftward ( resp .",

    "it is called a _ traveling semi - wave _ in @xcite since it is only defined for @xmath77 .",
    "we also write @xmath78 as @xmath79 to emphasize the dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath33 , then we will show in lemma [ lem : semi - wave ] that the equation @xmath80 has a unique root @xmath81 : @xmath82    we will see below that the traveling wave @xmath83 and the traveling semi - wave @xmath84 are of special importance in the study of spreading solutions . to explain their roles intuitively , we consider the problem with initial data @xmath85 which is even and @xmath86,\\\\   \\mbox{smooth and decreasing } , & x\\in [ h_0 -1 , h_0 ] ,   \\end{array }   \\right .",

    "case 1_. when @xmath88 , the advection influence is not strong , the solution has enough space between the back and the front to grow up and to converge to 1 .",
    "its front approaches a profile like @xmath89 and moves rightward at a speed @xmath90 .",
    "its back approaches a profile like @xmath91 and moves leftward at a speed smaller than @xmath92 ( see details in theorem [ thm : profile of spreading sol ] below ) .",
    "this case is similar as the spreading phenomena in @xcite for the equation with @xmath44 . _",
    "case 2_. when @xmath93 with @xmath6 being the unique root of , the traveling wave @xmath94 travels rightward at a speed @xmath95 .",
    "hence the back of the solution @xmath62 , with a shape like @xmath96 , is pushed by @xmath94 to move rightward at a speed @xmath97 , and so @xmath98 locally uniformly .",
    "but , when the initial domain is wide enough , the solution still have enough space to grow up between the back and the front since the front moves rightward ( at a speed @xmath90 ) faster than the back . in this paper",
    "we call such a phenomena as _ virtual spreading _ ( see theorem [ thm : middle beta ] and lemma [ lem : condition for virtual spreading ] below ) .",
    "_ case 3_. when @xmath28 , the traveling wave @xmath99 is indeed a stationary solution of @xmath100 .",
    "however , the back of the solution @xmath62 still moves rightward at a speed @xmath101 since it starts from a compactly supported initial data @xmath35 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and see details below ) .",
    "hence virtual spreading still happens when @xmath102 is sufficiently large , since the front moves rightward at speed @xmath78 , faster than the back .",
    "_ case 4_. when @xmath103 , the back moves rightward ( at a speed @xmath104 ) faster than the front ( which moves rightward at speed @xmath105 ) .",
    "so the solution is suppressed by its back , and then @xmath98 uniformly . in summary ,",
    "the long time behavior of the solutions is quite different for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this paper is organized as the following . in section 2",
    "we present our main results . in section 3",
    "we give some preliminaries including the comparison principles , stationary solutions , several types of traveling waves , zero number arguments and some upper bound estimates . in section 4",
    "we study the influence of the advection on the long time behavior of the solutions . in section 5 ,",
    "we revisit the virtual spreading phenomena and give a uniform convergence for such solutions .",

    "moreover , it follows from the maximum principle that , when @xmath114 , the solution @xmath62 is positive in @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "we see that the long time behavior of the solutions of with small advection : @xmath139 is similar as the case without advection : @xmath140 ( cf .",
