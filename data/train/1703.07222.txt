    "it is thus interesting to investigate the phase diagram with varying @xmath16 and analyze the competition among various qh states .    in this paper , we determine the ground - state ( gs ) phase diagram of pseudospin-@xmath0 bose gases in a uniform synthetic magnetic field in the space of the total filling factor @xmath34 and the coupling ratio @xmath16 . to this end , we have performed an extensive exact diagonalization analysis in the lowest - landau - level ( lll ) basis on spherical and torus geometries .",

    "<S> we study the ground - state phase diagram of two - dimensional two - component ( or pseudospin-@xmath0 ) bose gases in a high synthetic magnetic field in the space of the total filling factor and the ratio of the intercomponent coupling @xmath1 to the intracomponent one @xmath2 . using exact diagonalization </S>",
    "<S> , we find that when the intercomponent coupling is attractive ( @xmath3 ) , the product states of a pair of nearly uncorrelated quantum hall states are remarkably robust and persist even when @xmath4 is close to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the case of an intercomponent repulsion , where a variety of spin - singlet quantum hall states with high intercomponent entanglement emerge for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this marked dependence on the sign of @xmath1 in light of pseudopotentials on a sphere , and also explain recent numerical results in two - component bose gases in mutually antiparallel magnetic fields where a qualitatively opposite dependence on the sign of @xmath1 is found . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus unveil an intriguing connection between multicomponent quantum hall systems and quantum spin hall systems in minimal setups . </S>"
