    "the delicate interplay between competing interactions in strongly correlated metals might lead to the emergence of novel unconventional phases which defy the standard theories of metals . in ce or yb @xmath4-based kondo - lattice systems",
    "the kondo effect , leading to the formation of a non - magnetic kondo singlet , competes with the magnetic ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "external or chemical pressure offer an immediate way to tune the interplay of these energy scales . a particularly successful way to find new unconventional states in these materials is to continuously suppress a magnetically ordered state to zero temperature at a quantum critical point ( qcp ) . in the vicinity of this qcp ,",
    "often unconventional metallic phases emerge , which display deviations from landau - fermi - liquid ( lfl ) behavior or unconventional superconducting states emerge . while many antiferromagnetic ( afm ) kondo - lattice systems",
    "are known , only a few show a ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state , e.g.  ybni@xmath5p@xmath6,@xcite cepd@xmath7rh@xmath8,@xcite ceagsb@xmath9@xcite , or cerupo@xcite , and are , therefore , of special interest .",
    "cerupo is a kondo - lattice system ( @xmath10  k ) which orders ferromagnetically at @xmath11  k @xcite .",
    "it belongs to the ce@xmath12po ( @xmath12 = fe , ru , co , and os ) family of compounds , which crystallizes in the tetragonal zrcusias - type structure.@xcite the ce@xmath12po compounds share the same crystal structure as the 1111 high - temperature iron - pnictide superconductors .",
    "the connection between the two families has been exemplified in cefepo . by substituting phosphorous with arsenic ,",
    "one obtains cefeaso , a parent compound of the iron - pnictide superconductors.@xcite ce@xmath12po can be seen as consisting of alternating layers of @xmath12p@xmath5 and oce@xmath5 tetrahedra stacked along the crystallographic @xmath13 direction .",
    "this layered structure is also reflected in the quasi - two dimensional character of the fermi surface found in band - structure calculations.@xcite the magnetization evidences a strongly anisotropic behavior with respect to the magnetic - field direction in the fm state . for field",
    "applied perpendicular to the @xmath13 axis a saturation moment of @xmath14 , and no hysteresis was found.@xcite in contrast , for field applied parallel to the @xmath13 axis , a spontaneous magnetic moment of @xmath15 was observed .",
    "the saturation moment is only @xmath16 .",
    "the hysteresis loop with a coercive field of @xmath17 t confirms the fm order .",
    "the magnetization data indicate that the magnetic moments are aligned ferromagnetically along the @xmath13 direction , while the easy magnetization direction is perpendicular to it .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted as a competition between the crystalline - electric - field ( cef ) anisotropy and the anisotropy of the rkky exchange interaction with respect to the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 components of the magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "the rkky interaction , which is responsible for the fm ordering is larger for the @xmath20 component of the magnetic moment than for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 components , while the cef anisotropy leads to a ground state cef doublet with a larger saturation moment in the basal plane than along the crystallographic @xmath13 axis .",
    "this complex magnetic behavior at ambient pressure suggests a strong sensitivity of the magnetic ground state to external parameters , such as chemical or hydrostatic pressure .",
    "indeed , isoelectronic substitution of ru by fe in ceru@xmath7fe@xmath8po suppresses the fm state continuously to zero temperature at about @xmath21 , which suggests the existence of a fm qcp.@xcite    previous electrical - resistivity studies under external pressure suggest that the magnetic ordering temperature is suppressed to zero around 3  gpa.@xcite based on resistivity data in a static magnetic field , it was speculated that the type of the magnetic ordering changes from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic as a function of pressure.@xcite here , we present a combined study of magnetic and electrical - transport properties evidencing the change of the type of magnetic ordering from fm to afm at @xmath1gpa .",
    "the analysis of our data substantiates the competition between fm and afm correlations .",
    "we further find that the nel temperature disappears abruptly around 3  gpa .",
    "this observation is consistent with the absence of any signature of the existence of a qcp in the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",

    "the temperature signals the transition from a pm to a fm state .",
    "the maximum of the sharp peak is taken to define the ordering temperature .",
    "the increase of pressure leads to the suppression of the ordering temperature . at @xmath33gpa the amplitude of the @xmath30 peak",
    "is strongly reduced when compared to lower pressures , suggesting that the type of magnetic order is changed from fm to afm . at this pressure , @xmath34k is obtained . for pressures up to @xmath35gpa , a hump in @xmath30 above the ordering temperature points to the existence of a second anomaly .",
    "we denote the temperature characteristic to this anomaly as @xmath29 .",
    "the presence of this anomaly is observed in both , real and imaginary parts of the ac susceptibility .",
    "furthermore , this anomaly shifts to lower temperatures as pressure increases and is suppressed by applying a small static magnetic field of @xmath36 t or by increasing the modulation field , @xmath37 , ( see fig.[ce101gpachivsbac ] and the corresponding discussion below ) .",
    "currently , the origin and the nature of the anomaly at @xmath29 are not known , but the magnetic - field dependence of the ac susceptibility described above might be explained by the formation of short - range fm correlations at @xmath29 .",
    "as expected for ce - based systems , the magnetic order is suppressed by pressure , thus at @xmath35gpa the magnetic order is detected in @xmath30 at @xmath38k .",
    "this is the highest pressure where we unambiguously detect the phase transition in our ac - susceptibility measurements , and thus the values of @xmath39 obtained from ac - susceptibility data above this pressure have to be considered with relatively large error bars .",
    "however , we can clearly follow the magnetic transition to pressures up to nearly @xmath40gpa in our electrical - resistivity measurements , where the anomaly is very sharp .",
    "similar to @xmath30 , the imaginary component of the susceptibility shows a significant change by application of pressure . for @xmath41gpa , no anomaly corresponding to the magnetic transition",
    "can be observed in @xmath42 , in contrast to the very large peak which we detect at lower pressures .",
    "this supports our suggestion of a pressure - induced change from fm to afm order in cerupo .     at different modulation fields @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution of the position of the peak in @xmath42 with @xmath37 is displayed in the inset of ( b ) for various pressures . ]",
    "additional information on the nature of the magnetic transition is obtained from changing the driving field ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "since a fm material below @xmath27 responds to magnetic field changes by domain - wall movement ( dwm ) , an increase in the amplitude of the ac - modulation field leads to a change of the position of the maximum and of the width of the anomaly in @xmath43 . at an afm transition ,",
    "this effect is not present . in cerupo at @xmath44 , the influence of the ac field on both the real and imaginary components of the ac susceptibility",
    "is shown in figs.[ce071gpachivsbac](a ) and [ ce071gpachivsbac](b ) , respectively . in the pm state ,",
    "all magnetic - susceptibility curves are indistinguishable , whereas in the magnetic state , the temperature dependencies of both @xmath45 and @xmath46 display nearly symmetric peaks with maxima at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . upon increasing the ac - field amplitude from @xmath49 to @xmath50mt ,",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath45 peak increases by a factor of @xmath50 , whereas that of the @xmath46 peak increases by a factor of @xmath51 .",
    "the positions of both peaks shift toward lower temperatures as the ac field increases . however , the dependence of @xmath48 on @xmath37 in the case of @xmath46 is stronger as compared to @xmath45 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 dependence of @xmath48 for selected pressures where the system has a fm ground state is presented in the inset of fig.[ce071gpachivsbac](b ) .",
    "the imaginary component of the ac susceptibility reflects the energy - loss processes in a fm material due to energy absorption by the domain walls during their excitation .",
    "thus , the shift of the @xmath46 peak in cerupo to lower temperatures with increasing the ac field indicates that at , e.g. , @xmath44 , @xmath52mt is strong enough to excite the dwm at @xmath26k , while an ac field of @xmath49mt can only excite dwm at higher temperatures of about @xmath53k .",
    "furthermore , the nearly exponential dependence of @xmath48 versus the amplitude of the ac field [ inset of fig.[ce071gpachivsbac](b ) ] indicates that the excitation of the domain walls is thermally activated .",
    "all of the properties are similar to those reported in standard fm systems and confirm the fm nature of the ordering .",
    "the @xmath37 dependence of @xmath48 is getting less and less pronounced upon increasing pressure .",
    "this suggests that dwm in cerupo is hindered by the increase of pressure .",
    "in contrast to the situation at @xmath54gpa , fig.[ce101gpachivsbac ] depicts the temperature dependence of the real part of the ac susceptibility of cerupo at @xmath33gpa at different ac fields . here ,",
    "the @xmath45 peak at @xmath28 is independent of the driving field , as expected for an afm phase transition .",
    "the weak shoulder above @xmath39 is attributed to the anomaly at @xmath55 . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the anomaly observed at @xmath29 is suppressed by increasing @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath41gpa , the peak size in @xmath42 ( not shown ) is drastically reduced when compared to lower pressures and only the position of the peak has a very weak ac - field dependence .",
    "based on the temperature where this peak appears , we attribute this weak signal in @xmath42 to the anomaly at @xmath29 , concluding that no signature of the magnetic phase transition in the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility exists when the system turns from the pm to the afm ground state .     as a function of the ac field .",

    "the anomaly observed in @xmath25 measurements at @xmath29 is indicated by @xmath56 .",
    "the dashed lines at @xmath57 and @xmath58 mark a change in the ground state of the system from fm to afm and afm to pm , respectively .",
    "the lines are guides to the eye . ]",
    "the pressure dependencies of the magnetic transitions in cerupo are depicted in fig.[phd ] .",
    "we included in this figure our data from both electrical - resistivity and magnetic - susceptibility measurements .",
    "as one can see , there is a good agreement between the results obtained from @xmath59 measurements using piston - cylinder - type ( open symbols , ref . ) and bridgman - type ( closed symbols ) pressure cells and those from the @xmath43 experiments .",
    "the fm order observed at ambient pressure at @xmath60k shifts to lower temperatures upon applying pressure , so that at @xmath61gpa the system orders ferromagnetically at @xmath62k . with further increasing pressure ( @xmath41gpa )",
    ", the nature of the magnetic order changes to afm .",
    "thus , we estimate the pressure at which this change occurs to be @xmath63gpa . the nel temperature is suppressed continuously by increasing pressure to @xmath64k at @xmath65gpa . above this pressure , i.e. , at @xmath66gpa , no indication of any magnetic transition",
    "can be observed in @xmath59 down to the lowest accessible temperature of @xmath67mk , suggesting that the magnetic order is suppressed in a first - order - like fashion .",
    "therefore , we estimated the critical pressure to be @xmath68gpa .",
    "the similar slopes observed in the pressure dependencies of the ordering temperatures in the fm and afm states hint at the same energy scale determining the size of the magnetic - transition temperature .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of a static magnetic field on the ground - state properties of cerupo . in the following , we primarily focus on the magnetic - field dependence of the ac susceptibility . however , our conclusions are also supported by our electrical - resistivity measurements .",
    "the three distinct regions emphasized in fig.[phd ] by fm ( @xmath69 ) , afm ( @xmath70 ) , and pm ( @xmath71 ) will be discussed separately ( see appendix[parmagnetic ] for the pm region ) .",

    "generally , in the case when the kondo temperature @xmath178 is much smaller than the splitting @xmath179 , between the ground - state and the first excited doublet the position of the high - temperature maximum ( @xmath180 ) in the electrical resistivity can be taken as a measure of the kondo temperature.@xcite in ce - based kondo lattices @xmath178 and , therefore , @xmath180 typically shift to higher temperatures upon application of external pressure .",
    "the opposite is observed in cerupo : @xmath181 initially shifts to lower temperatures upon increasing the pressure.@xcite such an unexpected negative shift might be explained if we assume the splitting @xmath150 between the ground - state and the first excited cef level to be less than @xmath182 and to decrease with increasing pressure .",
    "then @xmath181 depends on both , @xmath178 and @xmath150 , and may shift to lower temperatures with increasing pressure .",
    "this suggests that the excited cef level(s ) play an important role for the low - temperature properties of cerupo and have to be included in a theoretical scenario to explain the changes observed in the magnetic ground - state properties.@xcite the negative pressure shift of @xmath181 is consistent with a reduction of the cef anisotropy in the low - pressure regime ( @xmath183 gpa).@xcite above @xmath184gpa , the observation of two maxima ( shoulders ) can be attributed to the kondo scattering on the ground - state doublet and on the first excited cef level .",
    "we note that this pressure is close to the region where we observe the change from the fm to the afm order at low temperatures ( see the phase diagram in fig.[phd ] ) . upon further increasing pressure the two features in the resistivity exhibit distinct pressure dependencies : the high - temperature maximum increases almost linearly with increasing pressure ,",
    "while the low - temperature feature decreases in temperature up to 2gpa.@xcite above this pressure the low - temperature shoulder shows a temperature independent behavior.@xcite this is also the pressure range , @xmath185gpa , where we observe a different type of field - polarized fm order ( see sec.[afm_state ] ) .",
    "thus , we take this apparent connection between the high - temperature resistivity features , which indicate the pressure evolution of the corresponding energy scales , and the low - temperature magnetic phases as a hint of a pressure - induced change in the cef - level scheme and in the size and/or anisotropy of the magnetic exchange interaction . indeed , our data indicate a reduced magnetic anisotropy with increasing pressure ( see sec.[afm_state ] ) .",
    "this is also consistent with structural data , which reveal a decrease of the structural anisotropy.@xcite    at ambient pressure , the cef ground state of cerupo is presumably a @xmath186 doublet.@xcite based on the pressure evolution of the high - temperature resistivity features , which are directly related to the involved energy scales , one might speculate that one of the two excited @xmath187 doublets moves down in energy and becomes the new ground state upon increasing pressure .",
    "this could give rise to a change in the direction of the ordered moments from pointing along the crystallographic @xmath13 direction to an in - plane orientation .",
    "furthermore , the anisotropic rkky exchange interaction between the localized moments , which is responsible for the type of magnetic ordering , is expected to react sensitively on anisotropic changes of the lattice parameters . in cerupo ,",
    "the @xmath13 axis is more compressible than the @xmath188 axis , leading to a reduction of the crystalline anisotropy upon application of pressure.@xcite the @xmath189 decreases linearly from 2.051 at ambient pressure to 2.024 at 5.9gpa.@xcite thus , the evolution of the ground state of cerupo from fm to afm and finally pm is most likely based on the complex changes of the cef - level scheme and the rkky exchange interaction . in the latter case , the reduced anisotropy might play an important role .",
    "in particular , the sensitivity and the different response of the afm state to the application of a static magnetic field at the different pressures is a direct response to this complex behavior ( see sec.[afm_state ] ) .",
    "while external pressure reduces the anisotropy in cerupo,@xcite isoelectronic substitution of ru by fe in ceru@xmath7fe@xmath8po enhances the anisotropy significantly . upon increasing the external pressure both",
    ", the @xmath188- and @xmath13-axis lattice parameters shrink , while upon increasing the fe concentration in cerupo , @xmath188 decreases and @xmath13 increases leading to an enhancement of the anisotropy.@xcite this increase of the crystalline anisotropy correlates with a decrease of the dimensionality of the fm fluctuations.@xcite nmr data indicate dominant three - dimensional fm correlations at ambient pressure which give rise to the fm ordering in cerupo.@xcite with increasing the fe concentration , the out - of - plane fluctuations are significantly suppressed and the fm fluctuations become two dimensional near a fm qcp at @xmath21 in ceru@xmath7fe@xmath8po.@xcite for the observed behavior , kitagawa _ et al . _  suggest a new and different tuning mechanism , namely , that @xmath97 is suppressed to a fm qcp by tuning the dimensionality of the magnetic correlations .",
    "in contrast to the fe substitution , by increasing the external pressure we drive cerupo to the opposite direction making the material less anisotropic . adopting now the scenario proposed by kitagawa _",
    "_ , the different response to _ pressure _ observed in our external - pressure investigation is no surprise and in line with the iron - substitution studies,@xcite even though both the external pressure and fe substitution lead to a reduction of the unit - cell volume.@xcite recently , we became aware of an nmr study on cerupo under external pressure.@xcite the general conclusions of that work are consistent with our results , though , we note that a magnetic field had to be applied to take the nmr data .",
    "in summary , cerupo is one of the rare examples of a fm kondo - lattice system .",
    "application of hydrostatic pressure suppresses the magnetic - ordering temperature .",
    "the type of magnetic order changes from fm to afm at about @xmath1gpa , where possibly a tricritical point exists .",
    "the nel temperature disappears abruptly around @xmath190gpa in a first - order - like fashion .",
    "the electrical resistivity exhibits a lfl behavior in the whole investigated pressure range , which is consistent with the absence of a qcp at @xmath3 in cerupo .",
    "the change in the type of the magnetic ordering seems to be intricately related to the pressure evolution of the cef - level scheme and of the anisotropy of the magnetic exchange interaction .",
    "even though cerupo possesses an afm ground state between @xmath96 and @xmath3 , the application of a small magnetic field ( @xmath72 ) induces a field - polarized state .",
    "we find further evidence that the fm correlations at high pressures ( @xmath191gpa ) are different in nature compared with the fluctuations at lower pressure .",
    "the fm fluctuations at high pressures might be related to fm in - plane and significant afm out - of - plane correlations .",
    "our results evidence that cerupo is close to ferromagnetism in the entire pressure range @xmath192 , in particular , also where it possesses an afm ground state .",
    "furthermore , our data lead us to speculate that not only is the type of magnetic ordering changing , but also the direction of the ordered moments . to confirm this suggestion ,",
    "further microscopic magnetic measurements on cerupo in zero magnetic field under external pressure would be desirable .",
    "the interaction between magnons and conduction electrons in a magnetic metal contributes to the electrical resistivity along with the electron - phonon , electron - electron , and electron - impurity scattering .",
    "it has been shown that at temperatures below the magnon energy gap @xmath150 , the electron - magnon resistivity falls off exponentially with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the temperature dependence of the resistivity in a fm metallic system with a magnon energy gap is proportional to @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "andersen and smith @xcite predicted that , at low temperatures , the resistivity can be described by @xmath194 . in our analysis , we follow the approach of ref ..    in general , the resistivity associated with electrons scattering off an arbitrary type of boson excitation , e.g. , magnon or phonon , is given by @xcite    @xmath195    where @xmath196 is the number density of the charge carriers , @xmath197 is the density of states per spin at the fermi level , @xmath198 represents the maximum wave - vector transfer , @xmath199 is the electron - boson coupling , and @xmath200 is the boson energy for a given wave vector @xmath201 .",

    "if a gap is present in the magnon spectrum , in the case of an anisotropic fm material , the electron - magnon coupling is independent of @xmath206 and the energy dispersion relation of the magnons is expressed by @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the spin - wave stiffness @xcite .",

    "@xmath210 is a constant for a given material depending on the spin - wave stiffness and the strength of the electron - magnon coupling .",

    "the size of the gap , @xmath150 , obtained from the fits according to eq.([eqn : rho with afm gap ] ) in the afm regime is plotted as a function of pressure in fig.[rho(p)_fit with magnon gap](b ) .",
    "there is a clear correlation between @xmath128 and @xmath220 in the afm state , i.e. , both decrease with increasing pressure . in particular , for @xmath159 , the gap decreases linearly with increasing pressure .",
    "an extrapolation of @xmath221 yields the critical pressure @xmath161gpa .",
    "this value coincides with the critical pressure where @xmath28 is completely suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , the values of @xmath150 obtained at @xmath222 and @xmath223gpa deviate slightly from the linear - in-@xmath122 dependence of @xmath150 .",
