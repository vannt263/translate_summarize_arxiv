    "[ fig : gapvsb ] , and agrees with experiments when extrapolated to low fields of the experiments .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a magneto - electric state , with loop currents ordered in each layer as in haldane s phase but with odd - parity combination of two layers , is the ground state of interacting bilayer graphene .",
    "it has a gap which increases monotonically with the applied magnetic field , which is in agreement with the experimental observations on a gapped state in bilayer graphene .",
    "we have also considered the possibility of the actual realization of the haldane ahe state in a single layer graphene by our mean - field procedure . again",
    "the nearest - neighbor interactions are ineffective and need a very large value to get any change in symmetry , but a next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath15 larger than about 0.1@xmath70 leads to the haldane state .",

    "we discuss further experiments which test the applicability of our proposed me state , to differentiate from other proposed states from weak - coupling .",
    "( 1 ) the me state is characterized by not only an indirect gap ( across @xmath16 and @xmath17 points ) , which is related to the observed gap @xmath71 mev , but also a direct gap ( at @xmath16 or @xmath17 point ) , proportional to the loop current order parameter , of the order of the interlayer hopping .",
    "this is different from other weak - coupling proposals where only a low - energy gap exists .",
    "the direct gap leads to sharp features at high energies , such as the jumps in the density of states around @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",

    "we suggest optical absorption measurements on high mobility , dual - gated suspended bilayer graphene samples to check these features .",
    "( we note , however , previous optical absorption measurements of bilayer graphene on a substrate , which do not realize an insulating state , have not observed a direct band gap at the nodes .",
    "@xcite ) ( 2 ) the me state breaks not only time - reversal symmetry through loop current patterns in each layer , but also inversion symmetry across the layers .",
    "the former leads to a monotonically increasing gap in a magnetic field similar to the ahe state which has even parity across the layers .",
    "we note that an inversion symmetry - breaking term , such as an electric field perpendicular to the layers , introduces a linear coupling of ahe and me order parameters ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this promotes the ahe state when the me order parameter is finite .",
    "the two - terminal probe indeed showed a finite conductance @xmath73 when a finite perpendicular electric field is applied ,  @xcite which may be interpreted as a signature of the ahe state .",

    ". therefore , there are two types of ordered loop current states ( the other combinations are equivalent to either of these two states by rotation ) .",
    "we carry out a mean - field calculation on the ground - state energy for these states , and find that the states with different patterns for two layers are lower in energy .",
    "this lower energy state is allowed only if @xmath80 , i.e. , be comparable to the bandwidth .",
    "the reason is that such a state does not have a  nesting \" periodicity and therefore does not use any singularity in the joint density of states .",
