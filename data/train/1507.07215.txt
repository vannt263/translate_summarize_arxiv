    "the potential between two static colourless dipoles is the simplest example of interaction between colour - neutral objects that can be studied in the framework of non - abelian gauge field theories .",
    "the main physical application of this quantity is in the study of the interaction between quarkonia , i.e. , mesons made of heavy quarks , which can be treated as static colourless dipoles in a first approximation . from the theoretical point of view , the study of the static dipole - dipole potential poses a nontrivial challenge . indeed ,",
    "as one is typically interested in its large - distance behaviour to describe the interaction between quarkonia , the interesting properties of the potential are mainly affected by the nonperturbative behaviour of the underlying theory , namely quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "another complication stems from the fact that the mathematical objects relevant to the theoretical study of the dipole - dipole potential are nonlocal operators , namely wilson loops .",
    "calculations of the static dipole - dipole potential available in the literature  @xcite deal with the regime of small dipole sizes in @xmath4 gauge theories , mostly using perturbative techniques . even in this somewhat simpler framework",
    ", the determination of the static potential requires a careful treatment of colour interactions within the dipoles , and of the nonlocality of the wilson loop , in order to avoid the apparent divergence of the potential .",
    "this requires a partial resummation of the perturbative series  @xcite , or equivalently a representation of the static dipoles in terms of a series of local operators , in the spirit of the operator product expansion  @xcite . for short inter - dipole distances",
    "@xmath5 , larger than the dipole size @xmath6 but smaller than the typical hadronic scale , @xmath7 , one can reliably apply perturbation theory to obtain an estimate of the potential , which behaves as @xmath8  @xcite . at large distances , instead , one has to supplement the perturbative description of the small dipoles with nonpertubative techniques , like the chiral lagrangians used in ref .",
    "the leading behaviour for @xmath9 is related to the two - pion threshold , and was found to be of the form @xmath10  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to study the static dipole - dipole potential in a purely nonperturbative setting , starting from the definition in terms of a certain wilson - loop correlation function , and using only general properties of the theory , namely its symmetries and its spectrum , to derive the asymptotic large - distance behaviour .",
    "the basic idea is to insert a complete set of states between the wilson loops in the relevant correlation function , and relate the large - distance behaviour of the potential to the spectrum of the theory .",
    "there are several motivations behind this work .",
    "first of all , the fully general results for the dipole - dipole potential derived in this paper provide nontrivial benchmarks for approximate nonperturbative approaches to qcd , like the anti - de sitter / qcd ( ads / qcd ) correspondence or the instanton liquid model ( ilm ) , and to gauge theories in general . in particular , we confirm the previous calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , and provide a fully nonperturbative definition of the various numerical factors entering @xmath11 .",
    "we also compare our results to the recent determinations of refs .",
    "@xcite , based on ads / qcd and on the ilm , respectively .",
    "moreover , since our results apply to a generic gauge theory ( with mass gap ) , it is possible to obtain information on the interaction of colour - neutral states in various theoretically interesting limits , like the isospin limit , or the _ quenched _ limit , and to establish how sensitive it is to these `` deformations '' of qcd .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . after setting the notation in section [ sec : not ] , in section [ sec : wlc ]",
    "we express the static dipole - dipole potential in terms of a sum over a complete set of states . in section [ sec : largeb ] we study the behaviour of the potential at asymptotically large distances , focussing in particular on pure @xmath4 gauge theory , and on gauge theories with light fermions ( which include qcd ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions . most of the technical details are reported in the appendices [ app : partitions ] , [ app : expo ] , [ app : larget ] and [ sec : spzero ] .",

    "let us briefly discuss the potentially confusing issue of euclidean `` time '' .",
    "usually , the long sides of the loops are taken to be parallel to the euclidean `` time '' direction , so that the loops describe the evolution of the dipoles over an amount @xmath26 of euclidean `` time '' , which is eventually taken to infinity .",
    "however , the notion of euclidean `` time '' is well defined only after setting up the hamiltonian formulation of the theory , while in the lagrangian formulation employed in the functional - integral formalism the direction of `` time '' can be chosen arbitrarily , thanks to the @xmath97 invariance of the euclidean theory . in our approach",
    "we exploit this arbitrariness , and we use two different choices of `` time '' at different stages of the calculation . for our purposes , it is convenient at first to take `` time '' along the separation between the centers of the loops . in this way , after going over to the operator formalism , one can extract the large - distance behaviour of the loop - loop correlator in the usual way , by inserting a complete set of states between the wilson - loop operators .",
    "schematically , @xmath98 denotes a wilson loop centered at the origin , spanning a temporal interval of size @xmath27 , and with a long spatial side of size @xmath26 [ for more details see eqs .",
    " , and below in this section ] , and a caret denotes the corresponding operator . here",
    "@xmath99 denotes an energy eigenstate .",
    "the large - distance behaviour of the correlator is then obtained from the contributions of the lightest states to eq .  .",
    "to determine the dipole - dipole potential one has to further take the limit @xmath100 , which affects the wilson - loop matrix elements appearing in eq .  .",
    "as we show below in section [ sec : me ] , these matrix elements can be related to the correlation function ( again in the sense of the euclidean functional integral ) of a wilson loop with appropriate euclidean interpolating fields , corresponding to the particles appearing in the state @xmath99 . to study these correlation functions ,",
    "it is useful to go over again to the operator formalism , but with choosing now the `` time '' direction along the long side of the loop : @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the euclidean interpolating fields , and @xmath103 denotes time - ordering of the operators along the direction of the long side of the loop . here",
    "the wilson - loop operator is denoted by @xmath104 , to make it explicit that a different time - ordering is used [ see eq .  ] : although @xmath105 and @xmath104 correspond to the same euclidean path , they are in effect different operators . from the representation eq .",
    "we can then establish the relevant properties of the matrix element in the large-@xmath26 limit , and by taking @xmath100 we can finally derive the dipole - dipole potential at large distances .",
    "we want to stress the fact that it is perfectly legitimate to use different choices for the `` time '' direction to recast the same ( functional - integral ) correlation function in the operator formalism in different ways , in order to study different aspects of said correlation function , as long as these choices are used consistently . in our case ,",
    "different choices for the `` time '' direction are made in the study of different correlation functions , namely the loop - loop [ eq .  ] and the loop - interpolating fields [ eq .  ] correlation functions , so that no inconsistency can arise .",

    "be performed entirely in euclidean space .",
    "have to be regarded simply as a useful mathematical device : those loops have in fact no relation with the physical process of static dipoles evolving over a large physical time . ]",
    "let us now return to eq .   and proceed in a more detailed fashion .",
