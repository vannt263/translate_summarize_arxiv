    "the @xmath6-reggeon s partial amplitudes are proportional to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is called an intercept .",
    "it is of great importance to calculate the intercepts @xmath13 in qcd , not only because they govern the high energy behavior of the forward elastic amplitudes but also because , _ e.g. _ for @xmath14 , they are responsible for the small bjorken @xmath15 behavior of the deep inelastic structure functions .",
    "the lowest non - trivial contribution for @xmath14 was calculated in the leading logarithmic approximation by balitsky , fadin , kureav and lipatov @xcite , who derived and solved equation for the pomeron intercept .",
    "the equation for three and more reggeons was formulated in refs.@xcite .",
    "it took , however , almost 20 years before the solution for @xmath16 was obtained in refs.@xcite .",
    "the real progress started with an observation that the @xmath6-reggeon exchange is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem of a schrdinger like equation with calculable interaction hamiltonian @xmath17 . here",

    "there have been many attempts either to directly find the values of @xmath34 @xcite-@xcite or to find the spectrum of odderon charge @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "finally , in ref.@xcite the singlevaluedness conditions for the wave function @xmath36 were formulated and the spectrum of @xmath37 was found .",
    "this allowed to calculate the energy @xcite ( hence also the odderon intercept ) for the conformal weight @xmath38 which supposedly gives the largest contribution to the elastic amplitude .",
    "it is , however , interesting to see explicitly whether @xmath38 gives really the largest intercept and whether the there exist other solutions to the singlevaluedness conditions than the ones found in @xcite .",

    "it is easy to observe that in equation ( [ eq : uinfn ] ) for @xmath91 the term @xmath94 tends to infinity . in this case",

    "this can be done by expanding one set of solutions defined around @xmath103 in terms of the solutions defined around @xmath104 for @xmath48 belonging to the overlap region of the two solutions considered .",

    "there exist two possible choices for @xmath99 : the one given by eq.([eq : qqbar ] ) and a similar one with the _ plus _ sign .",
    "this follows from the fact that the eigenvalues of holomorphic and antiholomorphic hamiltonian , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are symmetric functions of @xmath0 and @xmath99 respectively @xcite .",

    "the wave function @xmath36 has to be singlevalued .",

    "this leads to the quantization condition for the conformal weight @xmath1 @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath41 are real and @xmath136 .",

    "the normalization condition of the wave function requires that @xmath137 for the physical odderon solution .",
    "the fact that the wave function @xmath36 should be singlevalued imposes certain conditions on the form of matrix @xmath138 .",

    "this expression is singlevalued only if @xmath141 . for @xmath74 of eq.([eq : si ] ) this is true only for @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the matrices @xmath143 have a diagonal form @xmath144    for the solutions around @xmath71 ( [ eq : uinf ] , [ eq : uinfq0 ] ) , and for @xmath145 , the matrix element @xmath139 is multiplied by a factor @xmath146 .",
    "one should notice that solutions of the indicial equation @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 differ by an integer and @xmath150 are solutions of the indicial equation in the antiholomorphic sector .",
    "] , therefore terms which correspond to the elements",
    "@xmath151 i  @xmath152 , do not vanish .",
    "furthermore , terms with a logarithm appear in the solutions @xmath153 and @xmath154 for @xmath155 .",
    "one can see that when @xmath156 then in the sum the ambiguous arguments of the logarithms cancel out .",
    "moreover , for @xmath155 the term which corresponds to the matrix element @xmath157 is not singlevalued .",
    "it contains a square of the logarithm which does not occur in any other terms . for this reason the element @xmath158 has to vanish .",
    "thus the matrices @xmath138 , defined around @xmath71 , have the following form @xmath159    substituting equation ( [ eq : dgo ] ) into the wave function ( [ eq : phizxi ] ) , one finds the following conditions for the matrices @xmath160 @xmath161 each of the formulae ( [ eq : ainfam]-[eq : apainf ] ) is equivalent to a set of nine equations which can be conveniently written in terms of the following 4 vectors : @xmath162 we can now rewrite equations ( [ eq : ainfam],[eq : amap],[eq : apainf ] ) in the following form :    * equation ( [ eq : ainfam ] ) : * * for @xmath163 as @xmath164 * * for @xmath165 as @xmath166 * equation ( [ eq : amap ] ) as @xmath167 * equation ( [ eq : apainf ] ) : * * for @xmath163 as @xmath168 * * for @xmath169 as @xmath170    definitions of matrices @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 are given in appendix b.    equations ( [ eq : buld]-[eq : dpuld ] ) have nonvanishing solutions only if the determinants of matrices with subscripts _ up _ and _ low _ are equal zero . moreover there should exist the unique solutions of these equations : @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 which depend only on one free parameter which can be fixed by normalizing the wave function @xmath36 .",

    "3 .   in the case when @xmath230 does nt exist , which means that the equations are contradictory , we adopt a procedure which tries to find some @xmath239 which decreases the test function ( [ eq : mtaylor ] ) . if our set of equations is not contradictory then the algorithm reduces itself to two other cases . 1 .   let @xmath191 be a number of linearly independent equations which are not contradictory .",
    "then , from the set of equations ( [ eq : syseq ] ) we can construct @xmath240 sets of @xmath191 linearly independent equations . each of these sets determines @xmath191 entries of the @xmath219 dimensional vector @xmath241 . here",

    "instead of finding a zero of the @xmath218-dimensional function @xmath220 we shall be looking for a global minimum of a function @xmath248 of course there can be some local minima of eq.([eq : ff ] ) that are not solutions of eq.([eq : syseq ] ) .",

    "it is obvious that because of the linearity of the algorithm @xmath263 but , if @xmath264 , then our procedure leads towards the solution of ( [ eq : f0 ] ) , provided we are not in a vicinity of a false ( i.e. local ) minimum of @xmath249 . in the latter case we have to change the initial conditions and start be whole procedure again .",
    "we shall describe a curve as a set of points placed along some path where the distance @xmath265 between all neighboring points , should be constant . by definition",
