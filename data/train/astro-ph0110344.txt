    "what _ is _ surprising is that populations of galaxies show several very precise relationships among their measured properties .",
    "the properties we use to describe galaxies span a large `` configuration space '' , but galaxies do not fill it . galaxy spectral energy distributions , when scaled to a fixed broad - band luminosity , appear to occupy a thin , one - dimensional locus in color space or spectrum space ( e.g. , connolly & szalay 1999 ) .",
    "spiral galaxies show a good correlation between rotation velocity and luminosity ( e.g. , tully & fisher 1977 ; giovanelli et al .",

    "their spectral energy distributions appear to be virtually universal , showing very little variation with mass , environment , or cosmic time ( e.g. , van  dokkum & franx 1996 ; pahre 1998 ) .",
    "what variations they do show are measurable and precise .",
    "early - type galaxy colors , luminosities , half - light radii , velocity dispersions , and surface brightnesses are all correlated ( baum 1959 ; fish 1964 ; faber & jackson 1976 ; kormendy 1977 ; bingelli , sandage & tarenghi 1984 ) ; they can be combined into a two - dimensional `` fundamental plane '' with very little scatter ( e.g. , dressler et al .",

    "the homogeneity of the early - type galaxy population is difficult to understand if early - type galaxies are assembled at late times by stochastic mergers of less - massive galaxies of , presumably , different ages , star formation histories , and gas contents , as many models postulate ( e.g. , larson 1975 ; white & rees 1978 ; van albada 1982 ; kauffmann 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",

    "the observable properties of the stellar content of early - type galaxies are fixed entirely by the properties of the collisionless , self - gravitating , dark - matter haloes in which we believe such galaxies lie ( e.g. , hernquist 1990 ) .",
    "these halos , almost by definition , are not subject to the vagaries of gas dynamics , star formation , and magnetic fields ; they are influenced only by gravity .",

    "the errors in @xmath49 band measurements are larger than the others , so we will only present results in the other four bands .",
    "in addition , the photometric solutions we use in this paper are preliminary ( for details , see discussion of the early data release in stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) ; we use @xmath5 rather than @xmath51 , and similarly for the other bands , to denote this .",

    "the raw ccd images are bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and background - subtracted .",

    "astronomical sources are detected and overlapping sources are de - blended .",

    "all of this image processing is performed with software specially designed for reducing sdss data ( lupton et al .",
    "the uncertainty in the sky background subtraction is less than about 1% .",
    "the median effective seeing ( the median fwhm of the stellar profiles ) for the observations used here is @xmath54 .",
    "when obtaining the photometric parameters below , the light profiles are corrected for the effects of seeing , atmospheric extinction , galactic extinction ( this last uses the results of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) , and are flux - calibrated by comparison with a set of overlapping standard - star fields calibrated with a 0.5-m `` photometric telescope '' ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ; uomoto et al .",
    "the uncertainty in the zero - point calibration in the @xmath5-band is @xmath55  mag .",
    "the photometric telescope is also used for measuring the atmospheric extinction coefficients in the five bands .",
    "the sdss image processing software provides several global photometric parameters , for each object , which are obtained independently in each of the five bands . because we are interested in early - type galaxies , we use",
    "primarily the following : 1 ) the ratio @xmath56 of the lengths of the minor and major axes of the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "2 ) the effective radius ( or half - light radius ) @xmath57 along the major axis and 3 ) the total magnitude @xmath58 ; these are computed by fitting a two - dimensional version of de  vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath59 model to the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "( the fitting procedure accounts for the effects of seeing . )",
    "4 ) a likelihood parameter that indicates which of the fitting models , the de vaucouleurs or the exponential , provides a better fit to the observed light profile .",
    "5 ) the _ model _ magnitude @xmath60 ; this is the total magnitude calculated by using the ( de vaucouleurs or exponential ) model which fits the galaxy profile best in the @xmath5-band .",
    "the _ model _",
    "magnitudes in the other four bands are computed using that @xmath5 fit as filter ; in effect , this measures the colors of a galaxy through the same aperture .",
    "6 ) the petrosian magnitude @xmath61 is also computed ; this is the flux within @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is defined as the angular radius at which the ratio of the local surface brightness at @xmath51 to the mean surface brightness within a radius @xmath51 is 0.2 ( petrosian 1976 ) .",
    "7,8 ) the petrosian radii @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; these are the angular radii containing 50% and 90% of the petrosian light , respectively .",
    "although all the early - type galaxy analyses presented here have been performed with both the de  vaucouleurs fit parameters and the petrosian quantities , in most of the following only the results of the de  vaucouleurs fits are presented .",
    "this is because the de  vaucouleurs model appears to be a very good fit to the early - type galaxy surface - brightness profiles in the sdss sample and because it is conventional , in the literature on early - type galaxies , to use these quantities . in this paper ,",
    "unless stated otherwise , galaxy colors are always computed using _ model _ magnitudes .    to convert the apparent magnitude @xmath66 to an absolute magnitude @xmath67 we must assume a particular cosmology and account for the fact that at different redshifts an observed bandpass corresponds to different restframe bands ( the k - correction ) .",
    "we write the hubble constant today as @xmath68 kms@xmath69mpc@xmath69 and use @xmath70 .",
    "most of our sample is at @xmath71 kms@xmath69 ; since line - of - sight peculiar velocities are not expected to exceed more than a few thousand kms@xmath69 , we feel that it is reasonable to assume that all of a galaxy s redshift is due to the hubble recession velocity .",
    "this means that we can compute the absolute magnitude in a given band by @xmath72 - 25 - k(z)$ ] , where @xmath66 is the apparent magnitude , @xmath73 is the luminosity distance in mpc ( from , e.g. , weinberg 1972 ; hogg 1999 ) , and @xmath74 is the k - correction for the band .    because we have five colors and a spectrum for each galaxy , we could , in principle , compute an empirical k - correction for each galaxy .",
    "this requires a good understanding of the accuracy of the sdss photometry and spectroscopy , and should be possible when the survey is closer to completion . rather than follow the procedure adopted by the 2dfgrs ( madgwick et al .",
    "2001 ) , or a procedure based on finding the closest template spectrum to each galaxy and using it to compute the k - correction ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "1999 for the cnoc2 survey ) , we use a single redshift dependent template spectrum to estimate the k - correction . in effect , although this allows galaxies at different redshift to be different , it ignores that fact that not all galaxies at the same redshift are alike . as a result ,",
    "the absolute luminosities we compute are not as accurate as they could be , and this can introduce scatter in the various correlations we study below .",
    "of course , using a realistic k - correction is important , because inaccuracies in @xmath74 can masquerade as evolutionary trends .    for the reasons discussed more fully in appendix  [ kcorrs ] ,",
    "our k - corrections are based on a combination of bruzual & charlot ( 2002 ) and coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) prescriptions .",
    "specifically , the k - corrections we apply were obtained by taking a bruzual & charlot model for a @xmath75 object which formed its stars with an imf given by kroupa ( 2000 ) in a single solar metallicity and abundance ratio burst 9  gyr ago , computing the difference between the k - correction when evolution is allowed and ignored , and adding this difference to the k - corrections associated with coleman , wu & weedman early type galaxy template .",
    "the results which follow are qualitatively similar for a number of other k - correction schemes ( see appendix  [ kcorrs ] for details ) .",
    "in addition to correcting the observed apparent magnitudes to absolute magnitudes , we must also apply two corrections to convert the ( seeing corrected ) effective angular radii , @xmath57 , output by the sdss pipeline to physical radii .",
    "first , we define the equivalent circular effective radius @xmath76 .",
    "( although the convention is to use @xmath77 to denote the effective radius , we feel that the notation @xmath78 is better , since it emphasizes that the radius is an effective circular , rather than elliptical aperture . )",
    "figure  [ angre ] shows the distribution of effective angular sizes @xmath57 of the galaxies in our sample before correcting them to @xmath78 .",
    "notice that @xmath57 for most of the objects is larger than the typical seeing scale of 1.5 arcsec , suggesting that seeing does not compromise our estimates of @xmath78 .",
    "=    the reason we must make a second correction is also shown in figure  [ angre ] .",
    "the different panels show that the effective radius of a galaxy depends on wavelength ; galaxies appear slightly larger in the bluer bands .",
    "because our sample covers a reasonably large range in redshift , this trend means we must correct the effective sizes to a fixed restframe wavelength .",
    "therefore , when converting from effective angular size @xmath78 to effective physical size @xmath79 we correct @xmath78 ( and the petrosian radii @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) in each band by linearly interpolating from the observed bandpasses to the central rest wavelength of each filter .",
    "the typical correction is of the order of 4% ( although it is sometimes as large as 10% ) . in this respect",
    ", this correction is analogous to the k - correction we would ideally have applied to the magnitude and surface brightness of each galaxy .",
    ".photometric parameters and median errors of the objects in our sample . + [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : photerr ]    our study also requires the effective surface brightness @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the mean surface brightness within the effective radius @xmath79 ( as opposed to the surface brightness at @xmath79 ) . in particular , we set @xmath82 .",
    "note that this quantity is k - corrected , and also corrected for the cosmological @xmath83 dimming .",
    "our earlier remarks about the k - correction are also relevant here .",
    "table  [ tab : photerr ] summarizes the uncertainties on the photometric parameters we use in this paper .      as described in stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the sdss takes spectra only for a target subsample of objects .",
    "spectra are obtained using a multi - object spectrograph which observes 640 objects at once .",
    "each spectroscopic plug plate , 1.5 degrees in radius , has 640 fibers , each @xmath84 in diameter .",
    "two fibers can not be closer than @xmath85 due to the physical size of the fiber plug .",
    "typically @xmath86 fibers per plate are used for galaxies , @xmath87 for qsos , and the remaining for sky spectra and spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "each plate typically has three to five spectroscopic exposures of fifteen minutes , depending on the observing conditions ( weather , moon ) ; a minimum of three exposures is taken to ensure adequate cosmic ray rejection . for galaxies at @xmath88",
    "the median spectrum @xmath89 per pixel is 16 ( see figure  [ fig : vmeth ] in appendix  [ vmethods ] ) .",
    "the wavelength range of each spectrum is @xmath90   .",
    "the instrumental dispersion is @xmath91dex / pixel which corresponds to 69  kms@xmath69 per pixel .",
    "( there is actually some variation in this instrumental dispersion with wavelength , which we account for ; see figure  [ fig : resol ] and associated discussion in appendix  [ vmethods ] . )",
    "the instrumental resolution of galaxy spectra , measured from the autocorrelation of stellar template spectra , ranges from 85 to 105 kms@xmath69 , with a median value of 92 kms@xmath69 .",
    "a highly automated software package has been designed for reducing sdss spectral data .",
    "the raw data are bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , wavelength calibrated , sky - lines removed , co - added , cleaned from residual glitches ( cosmic rays , bad pixels ) , and flux calibrated . the spectro - software classifies objects by spectral type and determines emission and absorption redshifts .",
    "( redshifts are corrected to the heliocentric reference frame . )",
    "the redshift success rate for objects targeted as galaxies is @xmath92% and errors in the measured redshift are less than about @xmath93 . once the redshift as been determined the following quantites are computed : absorption - line strengths ( brodie & hance 1986 ; diaz , terlevich & terlevich 1989 ; trager et al . 1998 ) , equivalent widths of the emission lines , and eigen - coefficients and classification numbers of a pca analysis ( connolly & szalay 1999 ) . some information about the reliability of the redshift and the quality of the spectrum",
    "is also provided .",
    "the sdss pipeline does not provide an estimate of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath4 , within a galaxy , so we must compute it separately .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion @xmath4 is the result of the superposition of many individual stellar spectra , each of which has been doppler shifted because of the star s motion within the galaxy .",
    "therefore , it can be determined by analyzing the integrated spectrum of the whole galaxy .",
    "a number of objective and accurate methods for making velocity dispersion measurements have been developed ( sargent et al . 1977 ; tonry & davis 1979 ; franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 ; bender 1990 ; rix & white 1992 ) .",
    "each of these methods has its own strengths , weaknesses , and biases .",
    "appendix  [ vmethods ] describes how we combined these different techniques to estimate @xmath4 for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the velocity dispersion estimates we use in what follows are obtained by fitting the wavelength range @xmath94   , and then averaging the estimates provided by the _ fourier - fitting _ and _ direct - fitting _ methods to define what we call @xmath95 .",
    "( we do not use the cross - correlation estimate because of its behavior at low @xmath89 as discussed in appendix  [ vmethods ] . ) the error on @xmath95 is determined by adding in quadrature the errors on the two estimates ( i.e. , the fourier - fitting and direct - fitting ) which we averaged .",
    "the resulting error is between @xmath96  dex and 0.06  dex , depending on the signal - to - noise of the spectra , with a median value of @xmath97  dex .",
    "a few galaxies in our sample have been observed more than once .",
    "the scatter between different measurements is @xmath98  dex , consistent with the amplitude of the errors on the measurements ( see figure  [ fig : vrptd ] ) .",
    "based on the typical @xmath89 of the sdss spectra and the instrumental resolution , we chose 70 kms@xmath69 as a lower limit on the velocity dispersions we use in this paper .",
    "following jrgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and wegner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we correct @xmath95 to a standard relative circular aperture defined to be one - eighth of the effective radius : @xmath99 where @xmath100 arcsec and @xmath78 is the effective radius of the galaxy measured in arcseconds . in principle , we should also account for the effects of seeing on @xmath95 , just as we do for @xmath78 .",
    "however , because the aperture correction depends so weakly on @xmath78 ( as the 0.04 power ) , this is not likely to be a significant effect . in any case , most galaxies in our sample have @xmath101 arcsecs ( see figure  [ angre ] ) .    note",
    "that this correction assumes that the velocity dispersion profiles of early - type galaxies having different @xmath78 are similar . at the present time , we do not have measurements of the profiles of any of the galaxies in our sample , so we can not test this assumption . later in this paper",
    "we will argue that the galaxies in our sample evolve very little ; this means that if we select galaxies of the same luminosity and effective radius , then a plot of velocity dispersion versus redshift of these objects should allow us to determine if the aperture correction above is accurate .",
    "the results of this exercise are presented in appendix  [ vr ] .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the properties of early - type galaxies using the large sdss database .",
    "therefore , one of the crucial steps in our study is the separation of galaxies into early and late types .",
    "furthermore , we want to select objects whose spectra are good enough to compute the central velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition , because we wish to study the colors of the galaxies in our sample , we must not use color information to select the sample . to reach our goal , we have selected galaxies which satisfy the following criteria :    * concentration index @xmath102 ; * the likelihood of the de vaucouleurs model is at least 1.03 times the likelihood of the exponential model ; * spectra without emission lines ; * spectra without masked regions ( the sdss spectroscopic pipeline outputs a warning flag for spectra of low quality ; we only chose spectra for which this flag was set to zero ) ; * redshift @xmath103 ; * velocity dispersion larger than 70 kms@xmath69 and @xmath104 .",
    "the sdss pipeline does not output disk - to - bulge ratios from fits to the light profiles .",
    "the first two of the criteria above attempt to select profile shapes which are likely to be those of spheroidal systems .",
    "the spectra of late - type galaxies show emission lines , so examining the spectra is a simple way of removing such objects from the sample .    because the aperture of an sdss spectroscopic fiber ( @xmath84 ) samples only the inner parts of nearby galaxies , and because the spectrum of the bulge of a nearby late - type galaxy can resemble that of an early - type galaxy , it is possible that some nearby late - type galaxies could be mistakenly included in the sample ( e.g. , kochanek , pahre & falco 2001 ) .",
    "most of these will have been excluded by the first two cuts on the shape of the light profile . to check this , we visually inspected all galaxies with @xmath105 . about @xmath106 of 225 ( i.e. , about 20% ) looked like late - types , and so we removed them .",
    "most early - type galaxies in the sdss database at @xmath107 were targeted using different selection criteria than were used for the main sdss galaxy sample ( see strauss et al .",
    "2002 ; they make - up the luminous red galaxy sample described by eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the interest of keeping our sample as close to being magnitude limited as possible , we restricted our sample to @xmath108 .",
    "in addition , one might expect an increasing fraction of the early - type population at higher redshifts to have emission lines : if so , then our removal of emission line objects amounts to a small but redshift dependent selection effect .",
    "since our sample is restricted to @xmath108 , this bias should be small .    in appendix  [ vmethods ]",
    "we discuss why we consider velocity dispersion estimates smaller than about 70  kms@xmath69 to be unreliable .",
    "the results of this paper are not significantly different if we change the cut - off on velocity dispersions to 100  kms@xmath69 .",
    "=    using the above criteria we have extracted a sample of @xmath109 early - type galaxies .",
    "all the spectra in our sample have pca classification numbers @xmath110 , typical of early - type galaxy spectra ( connolly & szalay 1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : xzr ] displays the properties of our @xmath5-sample as a function of redshift @xmath53 .",
    "the panels show the k - corrected absolute magnitude @xmath67 , the k - corrected effective surface brightness @xmath111 , also corrected for cosmological surface brightness dimming , the effective circular radius @xmath79 in @xmath112kpc , corrected to a standard restframe wavelength , the aperture corrected velocity dispersion @xmath4 in kms@xmath69 , and two quantities which are related to an effective mass and density , all plotted as a function of redshift .",
    "the bold lines in the top left panel show the effect of the apparent magnitude cuts .",
    "there is , in addition , a cut at small velocity dispersion ( @xmath113  kms@xmath69 ) which , for our purposes here , is mostly irrelevant .",
    "the apparent magnitude cuts imply complex @xmath53-dependent cuts on the other parameters we observe . in",
    "what follows , we will attempt to account correctly for the selection effects that our magnitude cut implies .    for small intervals in luminosity ,",
    "our sample is complete over a reasonably large range in redshifts . to illustrate , the thin boxes in the top - left panel show bins in absolute magnitude of width 0.5 mags over which the sample is complete .",
    "the solid lines in the other panels show how the median surface - brightnesses , sizes , velocity dispersions , masses and densities of galaxies in each @xmath5 luminosity bin change as a function of redshift .",
    "although all these quantities depend on luminosity , the figure shows that , at fixed luminosity , there is some evidence for evolution : at fixed luminosity the average surface brightness is brightening .",
    "the size at fixed luminosity decreases at a rate which is about five times smaller than the rate of change of @xmath111 .",
    "this suggests that it is the luminosities which are changing and not the sizes .",
    "( to see why , suppose that the average size at fixed absolute magnitude is @xmath114\\rangle = s[m - m_*(z)]$ ] , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are characteristic values , and @xmath117 is the slope of this mean relation .",
    "if the characteristic luminosity increases with @xmath53 , but the characteristic size remains constant , @xmath118 , and the slope of the relation also does not change , then the mean size at fixed @xmath67 decreases with @xmath53 .",
    "the surface brightness is @xmath119 , so the mean @xmath111 at fixed @xmath67 changes five times faster than the mean @xmath79 , at fixed luminosity . )",
    "we will argue later that this trend is qualitatively consistent with that expected of a passively evolving population . before moving on ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that there is a morphologically based selection cut which we could have made but did nt .",
    "elliptical galaxies are expected to have axis ratios greater than about @xmath120 ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "since we have axis ratio measurements of all the objects in our sample , we could have included a cut on @xmath56 .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure  [ abscatter ] shows the distribution axis ratios @xmath56 in our @xmath5 sample : about 20% of the objects in it have @xmath121 .",
    "our combination of cuts on the shapes of the light profiles and spectral features mean that these objects are unlikely to be late - type galaxies .",
    "indeed , a visual inspection of a random sample of the objects with axis ratios smaller than 0.6 shows that they look like s0s . the bottom left panel of figure  [ abscatter ] shows that @xmath56 does not correlate with color : in particular , the colors of the most flattened objects are not bluer than in the rest of the sample . also , recall that all objects with @xmath122 arcsec were visually inspected and these , despite having @xmath121 ( top left panel ) , did not appear peculiar .",
    "in addition , @xmath56 does not correlate with surface brightness or apparent magnitude .",
    "however , there is a weak trend for the objects at higher @xmath53 to be rounder ( middle right panel ) .",
    "galaxies with small angular sizes @xmath57 are assigned large values of @xmath56 only slightly more often than average ( top left panel ; the median @xmath56 is 0.79 , 0.78 , 0.76 , and 0.7 for @xmath57 in the range 12 , 23 , 34 and greater than 4 arcsec ) , the trend with @xmath53 may be related to the magnitude limit of our sample rather than reflecting problems associated with the fits to the observed light profiles . for example , the smaller @xmath79 objects tend to be more flattened ( top right panel ) , and to have slightly smaller velocity dispersions ( middle left ) ; because of the magnitude limit , these objects drop out of our sample at higher redshifts . requiring",
    "that @xmath123 would remove such objects from our sample completely .",
    "=    later in this paper we will study the fundamental plane populated by the galaxies in this sample .",
    "excluding all objects with @xmath124 has no effect on the shape of this plane .",
    "so , in the interests of keeping our sample as close to being magnitude limited as possible , we chose not to make an additional selection cut on @xmath56 .",
    "we measure the luminosity function of the galaxies in our sample using two techniques .",
    "the first uses volume limited catalogs , and the second uses a maximum likelihood procedure ( sandage , tammann & yahil 1979 ; efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) .    in the first method",
    ", we divide our parent catalog into many volume limited subsamples ; this was possible because the parent catalog is so large .",
    "when doing this , we must decide what size volumes to choose .",
    "we would like our volumes to be as large as possible so that each volume represents a fair sample of the universe . on the other hand",
    ", the volumes must not be so large that evolution effects are important .",
    "in addition , because our catalog is cut at the bright as well as the faint end , large - volume subsamples span only a small range in luminosities .",
    "therefore , we are forced to compromise : we have chosen to make the volumes about @xmath125 thick , because @xmath126mpc is larger than the largest structures seen in numerical simulations of the cold dark matter family of models ( e.g. , colberg et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the catalogs are extracted from regions which cover a very wide angle on the sky , so the actual volume of any given volume limited catalog is considerably larger than ( @xmath127mpc)@xmath128 .",
    "therefore , this choice should provide volumes which are large enough in at least two of the three coordinate directions that they represent fair samples , but not so large in the redshift direction that the range in luminosities in any given catalog is small , or that evolution effects are washed out .",
    "the volume - limited subamples are constructed as follows .",
    "first , we specify the boundaries in redshift of the catalog : @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in the context of a world model , these redshift limits , when combined with the angular size of the catalog , can be used to compute a volume .",
    "this volume depends on @xmath131 and the world model : as our fiducial model we set @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "( our results hardly change if we use an einstein de - sitter model instead . )",
    "we then compute the k - corrected limiting luminosities @xmath134 and",
    "@xmath135 given the apparent magnitude limits , the redshift limits , and the assumed cosmology .",
    "a galaxy @xmath52 is included in the volume limited subsample if @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the luminosity function for the volume limited subsample is obtained by counting the number of galaxies in a luminosity bin and dividing by the volume of the subsample .",
    "=    the top panels in figure  [ lfev ] show the result of doing this in the @xmath10 and @xmath5 bands .",
    "stars , circles , diamonds , triangles , squares and crosses show measurements in volume limited catalogs which have @xmath138 , 0.08 , 0.12 , 0.16 , 0.20 , and 0.24 and @xmath139 . each subsample contains more than five hundred galaxies , except for the two most distant , which each contain about one hundred .",
    "as one would expect , the nearby volumes provide the faint end of @xmath140 , and the more distant volumes show the bright end . the extent to which the different volume limited catalogs all trace out the same curve is a measure of how little the luminosity function at low and high redshifts differs from that at the median redshift .",
    "the bottom panels in figure  [ lfev ] show evidence that , in fact , the galaxies in our data show evidence for a small amount of evolution : at fixed comoving density , the higher redshift population is slightly brighter than that at lower redshifts .",
    "although volume - limited catalogs provide model - independent measures of this evolution , the test is most sensitive when a large range of luminosities can be probed at two different redshifts . because the sdss catalogs are cut at both the faint and the bright ends , our test for evolution is severely limited",
    "nevertheless , the small trends we see are both statistically significant , and qualitatively consistent with what one expects of a passively evolving population .",
    "before we make more quantitative conclusions , notice that a bell - like gaussian shape would provide a reasonable description of the luminosity function .",
    "although early - type galaxies are expected to have red colors , our sample was not selected using any color information .",
    "it is reassuring , therefore , that the gaussian shape we find here also provides a good fit to the luminosity function of the redder objects in the sdss parent catalog ( see the curves for the two reddest galaxy bins in fig.14 of blanton et al .",
    "a gaussian form also provides a reasonable description of the luminosity function of early - type galaxies in the cnoc2 survey ( lin et al .",
    "1999 , even though they actually fit a schechter function to their measurements ) .",
    "the 2dfgrs galaxies classified as being of type 1 by madgwick et al .",
    "( 2001 ) should be similar to early - types .",
    "their type 1 s extend to considerably fainter absolute magnitudes than our sample .",
    "the population of early - type galaxies at faint absolute magnitudes is known to be very different from the brighter ones ( e.g. , sandage & perelmuter 1990 ) .",
    "this is probably why the shape of the luminosity function they report is quite different from ours .",
    "given that the gaussian form provides a good description of our data , we use the maximum - likelihood method outlined by sandage , tammann & yahil ( 1979 ) to estimate the parameters of the best - fitting luminosity function . for magnitude limited samples which are small and shallow ,",
    "this is the method of choice . for a sample such as ours , which spans a sufficiently wide range in redshifts that evolution",
    "effects might be important , the method requires a model for the evolution .",
    "we parametrize the luminosity evolution similarly to lin et al .",

    "( at small @xmath53 , this parametrization of the evolution in absolute magnitude implies that the luminosity evolves as @xmath145 , with @xmath146 .",
    "note that , in assuming that only @xmath116 evolves , this model assumes that there is no differential evolution in luminosities , i.e. , that luminous and not so luminous galaxies evolve similarly . )",
    "figure  [ lf4 ] shows the result of estimating the luminosity function in this way in the @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands . later in this paper",
    ", we will solve simultaneously for the joint distribution of luminosity , size and velocity dispersion ; it is the parameters which describe the luminosity function of this joint solution which are shown in fig .",
    "the dashed lines in each panel show the gaussian shape of the luminosity function at redshift @xmath147 . for comparison ,",
    "the symbols show the measurements in the same volume limited catalogs as before , except that now we have subtracted the maximum likelihood estimate of the luminosity evolution from the absolute magnitudes @xmath67 before plotting them .",
    "if the model for the evolution is accurate , then the different symbols should all trace out the same smooth dashed curve .",
    "=    =    the comoving number density of the galaxies in this sample is @xmath148mpc@xmath149 in all four bands . because the different bands have different apparent magnitude limits , and they were fit independently of each other ,",
    "it is reassuring that the same value of @xmath150 works for all the bands . for similar reasons , it is reassuring that the best - fit values of @xmath116 imply rest - frame colors at @xmath147 of @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , which are close to those of the models which we used to compute our k - corrections , even though no a priori constraint was imposed on what these rest - frame colors should be .",
    "the histograms in each of the four panels of figure  [ nz4 ] show the number of galaxies observed as a function of redshift in the four bands .",
    "the peak in the number counts at @xmath154 is also present in the full sdss sample , which includes late - types , and , perhaps more surprisingly , an overdensity at this same redshift is also present in the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "( the second bump at @xmath155 is also present in the 2dfgrs counts . )",
    "the solid curves show what we expect to see for the evolving gaussian function fits  the curves provide a reasonably good fit to the observed counts , although they slightly overestimate the numbers at high redshift in the redder wavebands . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed curves show what is expected if the luminosities do not evolve and the no - evolution luminosity function is given by the one at the median redshift ( i.e. , a gaussian with mean @xmath156 ) .",
    "although the fit to the high - redshift tail is slightly better , this no evolution model can not explain the trends shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ lfev ] .",
    "the bottom panels in figure  [ lfev ] suggest two possible reasons why our model of pure luminosity evolution overestimates @xmath157 at higher @xmath53 .",
    "one possibility is that the comoving number densities are decreasing slightly with redshift .",
    "a small amount of density evolution is not unexpected , because early - type galaxy morphologies may evolve ( van dokkum & franx 2001 ) , and our sample is selected on the basis of a fixed morphology . if we allow a small amount of density as well as luminosity evolution , and we use @xmath158 with @xmath159 , as suggested by the results of lin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , then the resulting @xmath157 curves are also well fit by the dashed curves .",
    "a second possibility follows from the fact that we only observe the most luminous part of the higher redshift population .",
    "if the most luminous galaxies at any given time are also the oldest , then one might expect the bright end of the luminosity function to evolve less rapidly than the fainter end .",
    "indeed , the bruzual & charlot ( 2002 ) passive evolution model , described in appendix  [ kcorrs ] , predicts that the rest - frame luminosities at redshift @xmath160 should be brighter than those at @xmath147 by 0.3 , 0.26 , 0.24 , and 0.21  mags in @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the curvature seen in the bottom panel of figure  [ lfev ] suggests that although the evolution of the fainter objects in our sample ( which we only see out to low redshifts ) is consistent with this , the brighter objects are not .",
    "models of such differential evolution in the luminosities also predict @xmath157 distributions which are in better agreement with the observed counts at high redshift .",
    "since the evolution of the luminosity function is small , we prefer to wait until were are able to make more accurate k - corrections before accounting for either of these other possibilities more carefully .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will continue to use the model with pure luminosity evolution .    repeating the exercise described above but for an einstein  de - sitter model yields qualitatively similar results , although the actual values of @xmath116 and @xmath150 are slightly different . at face value ,",
    "the fact that we see so little evolution in the luminosities argues for a relatively high formation redshift : the bruzual & charlot ( 2002 ) models indicate that @xmath161gyrs .",
    "in any given band , each galaxy in our sample is characterized by three numbers : its luminosity , @xmath1 , its size , @xmath79 , and its velocity dispersion , @xmath4 .",
    "correlations between these three observables are expected if early - type galaxies are in virial equilibrium , because @xmath162 if the size parameter @xmath163 which enters the virial theorem is linearly proportional to the observed effective radius of the light , @xmath79 , and if the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath4 is linearly proportional to @xmath164 , then this relates the observed velocity dispersion to the product of the observed surface brightness and effective radius .",
    "following djorgovski & davis ( 1987 ) , correlations involving all three variables are often called the fundamental plane ( fp ) . in what follows",
    ", we will show how the surface brightness , @xmath79 , and @xmath4 are correlated . because both @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath4 are distance independent quantities , it is in these variables that studies of early - type galaxies are usually presented .",
    "the fundamental plane is defined by : @xmath166 where the coefficients @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 are determined by minimizing the residuals from the plane .",
    "there are a number of ways in which this is usually done .",
    "let @xmath170 then summing @xmath171 over all @xmath172 galaxies and finding that set of @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 for which the sum is minimized gives what is often called the direct fit , whereas minimizing the sum of @xmath173 instead gives the orthogonal fit .",
    "although the orthogonal fit is , perhaps , the more physically meaningful , the direct fit is of more interest if the fp is to be used as a distance indicator .",
    "a little algebra shows that the direct fit coefficients are @xmath174 where @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "for what follows , it is also convenient to define @xmath177 .",
    "the final expression above gives the scatter around the relation .",
    "if surface brightness and velocity dispersion are uncorrelated ( we will show below that , indeed , @xmath178 ) , then @xmath167 equals the slope of the relation between velocity dispersion and the mean size at fixed velocity dispersion , @xmath168 is the slope of the relation between surface - brightness and the mean size at fixed surface - brightness , and the rms scatter is @xmath179 .",
    "errors in the observables affect the measured @xmath180 , and thus will bias the determination of the best - fit coefficients and the intrinsic scatter around the fit . if @xmath181 is the rms error in the joint measurement of @xmath182 and @xmath183 , then subtracting the appropriate @xmath184 from each @xmath180 before using them provides estimates of the error - corrected values of @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "expressions for the orthogonal fit coefficients can be derived similarly , although , because they require solving a cubic equation , they are lengthy , so we have not included them here .",
    "neither minimization procedure above accounts for the fact that the sample is magnitude - limited , and has a cut at small velocity dispersions .",
    "in addition , because our sample spans a wide range of redshifts , we must worry about effects which may be due to evolution .",
    "the magnitude limit means that we can not simply divide our sample up into small redshift ranges ( over which evolution is negligible ) , because a small redshift range probes only a limited range of luminosities , sizes and velocity dispersions . to account for all these effects",
    ", we use the maximum - likelihood approach described in appendix  [ ml3d ] .",

    "however , the coadded spectra provide strong evidence that the chemical composition of the population at low and high redshifts is different ( figures  [ fig : mg2sigma][fig : hbfemg2 ] ) .",
    "the colors of early - type galaxies are observed to correlate with their luminosities , with small scatter around the mean relation ( e.g. , baum 1959 ; de vaucouleurs 1961 ; bower , lucey & ellis 1992a , b ) . in this section",
    "we examine these correlations using the model colors output by the sdss photometric pipeline .",

    "if we are willing to assume that this relation does not evolve , then the different redshift bins probe different magnitudes , and we can build a composite relation by stacking together the relations measured in any individual redshift bin .",

    "we have shown that the color  magnitude and color@xmath4 relations in our sample provide strong evidence for evolution in the colors of early type galaxies , and no significant dependence on environment .",
    "it has been known for some time that giant early - type galaxies are reddest in their cores and become bluer toward their edges ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs 1961 ; sandage & visvanathan 1978 ) .",

    "this trend indicates that there are color gradients in early - type galaxies .",
    "the distribution of size ratios does not correlate with luminosity .",
    "however , the ratio of the effective size in the @xmath10 and @xmath5 bands is slightly larger for bluer galaxies than for redder ones , suggesting that color gradients are stronger in the galaxies which are bluer .",
    "in addition the scatter around the mean ratio is slightly larger for the bluer galaxies .",
    "=    as scodeggio ( 2001 ) emphasizes , if the effective sizes of galaxies depend on waveband ( cf .",
    "figure  [ rdiffs ] ) , then the strength of the color - magnitude relation depends on how the color is defined .",
    "therefore , we have tried five different definitions for the color .",
    "the first uses the total luminosities one infers from fitting a de vaucouleurs model to the light in a given band .",
    "the ` total ' colors defined in this way are relatively noisy , because they depend on independent fits to the surface brightness distributions in each band .",
    "we have already shown that the half - light radius is larger in the bluer bands .",
    "this means that a greater fraction of the light in the redder bands comes from regions which are closer to the center than for the bluer bands .",
    "therefore , the total color above can be quite different from that which one obtains with a fixed angular or physical aperture .    to approximate fixed physical aperture colors , we have integrated the de  vaucouleurs profiles in the different bands assuming a tophat filter ( since this can be done analytically ) of scale @xmath478 times the effective radius in @xmath112kpc , @xmath479 , for a few choices of @xmath478 .",
    "the resulting colors depend on @xmath478 , and the associated color magnitude relation decreases as @xmath478 decreases . we have arbitrarily chosen to present results for @xmath480 . these are not quite fixed aperture colors , since the effective angular aperture size varies from one galaxy to another , but , for any given galaxy , the aperture size is the same in all the bands ( i.e. , it is related to the effective radius in @xmath5 ) .",
    "a third color is obtained by using the light within a fixed angular aperture which is the same for all galaxies .",
    "the ` fiber ' magnitudes output by the sdss photometric pipeline give the integrated light within a three arsec aperture , and we use these to define the ` fiber ' color .",
    "a fourth color is that computed from the petrosian magnitudes output by the sdss photo pipeline .    a fifth color uses the ` model ' magnitudes output by the sdss photometric pipeline .",
    "these are close to what one might call fixed aperture colors , because they are obtained by finding that filter which , given the signal - to - noise ratio , optimally detects the light in the @xmath5 band , and then using that same filter to measure the light in the other bands ( which is one reason why they are less noisy than the total color defined above ) .",
    "( by definition , the model and total de  vaucouleurs magnitudes are the same in @xmath5 .",
    "they are different in other bands because the effective radius is a function of wavelength .",
    "we have verified that the difference between these two magnitudes in a given band correlates with the difference between the effective radius in @xmath5 and the band in question . ) in this respect , the model colors are similar to those one might get with a fixed physical aperture ( they would be just like the fixed physical aperture colors if the optimal smoothing filter was a tophat ) .",
    "these , also , are not fixed angular aperture colors , since the effective aperture size varies from one galaxy to another , but , for any given galaxy , the aperture is the same in all the bands .",
    "=    =    a final possibility is to use ` spectral magnitudes ' ; these can be made by integrating up the light in the spectrum of each galaxy , weighting by the different pass - band filters . whereas the other five colors require a good understanding of the systematics of the photometric data sets , this one requires a similar understanding of the spectroscopic data sets also .",
    "we have yet to do this .",
    "the resulting @xmath447 color - magnitude relations are shown in figure  [ fig : cmag ] .",
    "the @xmath311-axis in the top two panels is the de vaucouleurs magnitude in @xmath5 , whereas it is the fiber magnitude in @xmath5 in the third panel , the petrosian @xmath5 magnitude in the fourth panel , and the model @xmath5 magnitude in the bottom panel .",
    "for the reasons described in the previous subsection we must be careful that evolution effects do not combine with the magnitude limit of our sample to produce a shallow relation .",
    "our main goal here is to illustrate how the shape of the relation depends on the definition of color .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to divide our sample into two : a low - redshift sample , which includes all galaxies at @xmath356 , and a high - redshift @xmath481 sample .",
    "for each definition of color , we computed the slope and amplitude of the color ",
    "magnitude relation in the low redshift sample .",
    "this slope is shown in the top left corner of each panel .",
    "we then required the slope of the high redshift sample to be the same ( recall from figure  [ cmag3 ] that this is a good approximation ) ; the offset required to get a good fit is shown in the bottom left of each panel .",
    "this is the quantity which provides an estimate of how much the colors have evolved .",
    "the two thin solid lines in each panel show the low- and high - redshift color  magnitude relations computed in this way . for comparison",
    ", the dashed line shows a fit to the full sample , ignoring evolution effects ; in all the panels , it is obviously much flatter than the relation at low redshift .",
    "the figure shows clearly that the slope of the color - magnitude relation depends on how the color was defined : it is present when fixed - apertures are used ( e.g. , bottom panel ) , and it is almost completely absent when the total light within the de vaucouleurs fit is used ( top panel ) .",
    "our results are consistent with those reported by okamura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and scodeggio ( 2001 ) .",
    "note that one s inference of how much the colors have evolved , @xmath482 , also depends on how the color was defined .",
    "a similar comparison for the correlation between color and velocity dispersion @xmath4 is presented in figure  [ fig : csig ] .",
    "we have already argued that color@xmath26 is the primary correlation ; this relation is also considerably less sensitive to the different definitions of color .",
    "however , it is sensitive to evolution : a fit to the full sample gives a slope of 0.14 , compared to the value of 0.23 for the low redshift sample . because the mean color@xmath26 relation is steeper than that between color and magnitude , the change to the slope of the relation is less dramatic .",
    "the zero - point shifts , which estimate the evolution of the color , are comparable both for the color  magnitude and the color@xmath26 relations , provided the sdss model colors are used ( bottom panel ) .",

    "the intrinsic distributions of luminosity , velocity dispersion and size of the galaxies in our sample are each well described by gaussians in absolute magnitude , @xmath306 , and @xmath484 . at fixed luminosity , @xmath485 and @xmath486 ( see table  [ lx4cov ] for the exact coefficients ) , and galaxies which are slightly larger than expected ( given their luminosity ) have smaller velocity dispersions than expected .",
    "this is expected if galaxies are in virial equilibrium .",
    "the scatter around the mean @xmath24 and @xmath487 relations is sufficiently large that it is a bad approximation to insert them into the distribution of luminosities to estimate the distribution of sizes or velocity dispersions .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath487 relations are projections of a fundamental plane , in the space of @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath79 , which these galaxies populate . if this fundamental plane is defined by minimizing the residuals orthogonal to it , then @xmath488 ( see table  [ fpcoeffs ] for the exact coefficients ) .",
    "the fundamental plane is remarkably similar in the different bands ( figure  [ fig : fpgriz ] ) , and appears to be slightly warped in the shorter wavebands ( figure  [ fig : warped ] ) .",
    "residuals with respect to the direct fit ( i.e. , the fp defined by minimizing the residuals in the direction of @xmath484 ) do not correlate with either velocity dispersion or color , whereas residuals from the orthogonal fit correlate with both ( figures  [ fig : fpresidr ] ) . this correlation with @xmath4 is simply a projection effect ( see figure  [ fig : fpsigr ] and related discussion ) , whereas the correlation with color is mainly due to the fact that color and @xmath4 are strongly correlated .",
    "the fundamental plane is intrinsically slightly thinner in the redder wavebands .",
    "this thickness is sometimes expressed in terms of the accuracy to which the fp can provide redshift - independent distance estimates  this is about 20% . if the thickness is expressed as a scatter in the mass - to - light ratio at fixed size and velocity dispersion , then this scatter is about 30% .",
    "the simplest virial theorem prediction for the shape of the fundamental plane is that @xmath296 .",
    "this assumes that the observed velocity dispersion @xmath298 is proportional to the kinetic energy @xmath489 which enters the virial theorem .",

    "( 1997 ) argue that in their data @xmath490 , so that @xmath491 . since the coefficient of @xmath4 in the fundamental plane we find in all four bands is @xmath492 , it would be interesting to see if the kinetic energy for the galaxies in our sample scales as it did in busarello et al.s sample . to do this , measurements of the velocity dispersion profiles of ( a subsample of ) the galaxies in our sample are required .",
    "a plot of luminosity versus mass ( @xmath1 versus @xmath493 ) has a slope which is slightly shallower than unity  on scales of a few kiloparsecs , @xmath494 , approximately independent of waveband ( figure  [ lmass ] ) .",
    "this complements recent sdss weak - lensing analyses ( mckay et al . 2001 ) which suggest that mass is linearly proportional to luminosity in these same wavebands , but on scales which are two orders of magnitude larger ( @xmath495kpc ) .",
    "together , these two measurements of the mass to light ratio can be used to provide a constraint on the density profiles of dark matter halos .    a maximum likelihood analysis of the joint distribution of luminosities",
    ", sizes and velocity dispersions suggests that the population at higher redshifts is slightly brighter than the population nearby , and that the change with redshift is faster in the shorter wavebands : if @xmath496 , then @xmath497 , @xmath498 and @xmath499 in @xmath10 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "this evolution is sufficiently weak that , relative to their values at the median redshift ( @xmath500 ) of our sample , the sizes , surface brightnesses and velocity dispersions of the early - type galaxy population at lower and higher redshifts has evolved little .",
    "therefore , tests for passive evolution which use the fundamental plane only are severly affected by selection effects and the choice of the fiducial fundamental plane against which to measure the evolution ( figures  [ fig : fpzg][fig : fpresidmuz ] ) . nevertheless , these tests also suggest that the surface brightnesses of galaxies at higher redshifts in our sample are brighter than those of similar galaxies nearby .",

    "1996 ) allow one to translate the evolution in the spectral features into estimates of the ages and metallicities of the galaxies in our sample ( e.g. , trager et al .",
    "2000 ) . in our sample",
    ", the @xmath506 population appears to about 8  gyrs old ; the @xmath507 population in our sample appears to be about 2  gyrs younger ; and the average metallicity appears to be similar in both populations .",
    "the age difference is approximately consistent with the actual time difference in the @xmath508 world model we assumed throughout this paper , suggesting that the population is evolving passively . given a formation time , the single burst stellar population models also make predictions about how the luminosities and colors should evolve with redshift .",
    "our estimates of this evolution are also consistent with those of a population which formed the bulk of its stars 9  gyrs ago .    by the time the sloan digital sky survey is complete ,",
    "the uncertainty in the k - corrections , which prevent us at the present time from making more precise quantitative statements about the evolution of the luminosities and colors , will be better understood . in addition , the size of the sample will have increased by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this will allow us to provide a more quantitative study of the effects of environment than we are able to at the present time .",
    "in addition , a larger sample will allow us to coadd spectra in finer bins ; this will allow us to make maximum - likelihood estimates , rather than simple linear regression studies , of how features in the spectra correlate with other observables .",

    "when converting the observed apparent magnitude to the rest - frame absolute magnitude of an object , we must account for the fact that the sdss filters measure the light from a fixed spectral range in the observers rest - frame ; therefore , they measure different parts of the rest - frame spectrum of galaxies at different redshifts . correcting for this",
    "is known as the k - correction .",
    "one way to make this correction is to assume that all the galaxies at a given redshift are similar , and to use an empirically determined template spectrum , measured from a few accurately measured spectra , to estimate the k - correction .",
    "using a mean color to estimate the k - correction is not ideal . when the survey is closer to completion it should become possible to make this correction on an object - by - object basis .",
    "empirically determined template spectra for early - type galaxies at low redshifts exist ( e.g. coleman , wu & weedeman 1980 ; fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "( we used n. benitez s bayesian photometric redshift package ( benitez 2000 ) to derive k - corrections for the coleman , wu & weedman early - type galaxy template in the sdss passbands . ) if we were certain that evolution effects were not important , then these empirically determined k - corrections would allow us to work out the k - corrections we should apply to the high redshift population .",
    "however , if the stars in early - type galaxies formed at approximately the same time , and if the mass in the galaxies has remained constant , so the evolution is entirely due to the passive aging of the stellar population , then , the mass to light ratio of early - type galaxies is expected to vary approximately as @xmath509 ( e.g. , tinsley & gunn 1976 ) , with the precise scaling being different in different bands .",
    "because our sample spans a relatively large range in redshift , we may be sensitive to the effects of this passive evolution .",
    "in addition , because the sample is large , we may be able to measure , and hence be sensitive to , even a relatively small amount of evolution .",
    "for this reason , it would be nice to have a prescription for making k - corrections which accounts for evolution .",
    "absent empirically determined templates for this evolution , we must use stellar population systhesis models to estimate this evolution , and so determine k - corrections for different bands .",
    "=    as a first example , we chose a bruzual & charlot ( 2002 ) model for a @xmath75 object which formed its stars with the universal imf given by kroupa ( 2000 ) in a single solar metallicity and abundance ratio burst 9  gyr ago .",
    "we then recorded how its colors , as observed through the sdss filters , changed as it was moved through redshift without altering its age .",
    "this provides what we will call the no - evolution k - correction .",
    "figure  [ kcww - kbc ] shows a comparison of this with the empirical coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) nonevolving k - corrections .",
    "the two estimates are in good agreement in @xmath10 and @xmath11 out to @xmath510 .",
    "they differ substantially at higher redshifts , but this is not a concern because none of the galaxies in our sample are so distant . in @xmath5 and @xmath12 the two estimates agree only at @xmath511 .",
    "therefore , quantitative estimates of evolution in luminosity and/or color will depend on which k - correction we use .",
    "=    figure  [ fig : kcorr ] compares both sets of nonevolving templates with the observed colors of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the upper set of curves in each panel show the colors associated with the nonevolving coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) template ( dotted ) and the bruzual & charlot ( 2002 ) no - evolution model ( dashed ) .",
    "the figure shows that both predictions for @xmath447 are similar , but that they are different for @xmath449 and @xmath451 , with the differences increasing with redshift .",
    "[ in both cases , we have shifted the predicted @xmath447 blueward by 0.08  mag at all @xmath53 .",
    "such an offset appears to be required for the sdss photometric calibrations in stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which we use here ( also see eisenstein et al . 2001 and strauss et al . 2002 ) , although the reason for it is not understood . ]",
    "=    we argued in the main text that the spectra of these objects show evidence for passive evolution : the higher redshift population appears to be slightly younger .",
    "therefore , our next step is to include the effects of evolution .",
    "because the predicted observed colors at redshift zero are in good agreement with our data , we took the same bruzual & charlot ( 2002 ) model , but this time we recorded how its rest - frame colors evolve with redshift , and then computed what these evolved ( i.e. , @xmath53-dependent ) colors look like when observed in the sdss filters .",
    "these evolving colors are shown as the dot - dashed lines in figure  [ fig : kcorr ] . in an attempt to include evolution in the cww templates , we set @xmath512 .",
    "the lower solid lines in each panel of figure  [ fig : kcorr ] show the observed @xmath447 , @xmath449 and @xmath451 colors associated with these evolving models ( and again , the predicted @xmath447 curves have been shifted blueward ( downward ) by 0.08  mag at all @xmath53 ) . comparing the evolving bruzual ",
    "charlot and the coleman et al .",
    "colors with the upper set of no - evolution curves shows the evolution towards the blue at high redshift .",
    "although the data appear to be very well fit by the no - evolution curves , this agreement is slightly misleading .",
    "more luminous galaxies tend to be redder . as a consequence ,",
    "a magnitude limited catalog contains only the redder objects of the higher redshift population .",
    "a curve which describes the colors of the population as a whole will therefore appear to be biased blue .",
    "figure  [ kcorrsim ] shows this explicitly .",
    "the two panels were constructed by making mock catalogs of a passively evolving population ( i.e. , the higher redshift population is brighter and bluer ) in which our estimates of the correlation between colors , luminosities , velocity dispersions and color and luminosity evolution were included ( see table  [ mlcmag ] ) .",
    "the top panel shows the distribution of observed colors if there were no magnitude limit , and the bottom panel shows the observed colors of a magnitude limited sample .",
    "the solid curve , the same in both panels , is the predicted trend of color with redshift which we use to make our k - corrections ; i.e. , @xmath513 .",
    "notice that although it describes the complete simulations well , it is bluer than the higher redshift galaxies in the magnitude limited sample .",
    "comparison with the previous figure shows that the difference here is similar to that seen in the real data , suggesting that our k - corrections and evolution estimates of the mean of the population are self - consistent .    of course",
    ", if we do not observe the mean of the high redshift population , but only the redder fraction , then we must decide whether it is realistic to use a k - correction which has been constructed to fit the truely typical galaxy at each redshift .",
    "for example , if color is an indicator of age and/or metallicity , then the results above suggest that our sample contains the oldest and/or most metal rich part of the high redshift population .",
    "if the objects which satisfy our apparent magnitude limit are in fact , older than the typical high redshift galaxy , then it may be that those objects are similar in age to the average object at lower redshifts in our sample .",
    "if so , then we are better - off using a nonevolving k - correction even though the higher redshift sample as a whole is younger . none of the results presented in the main text change drastically if we use non - evolving rather than evolving k - corrections .",
    "= 1.1    to decide whether to chose to use k - corrections based on the coleman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) template or the bruzual & charlot ( 2002 ) models , we computed the color - magnitude and color-@xmath4 relations in both cases .",
    "the slopes of the mean relations , and the scatter around the mean , remained approximately the same for both k - corrections , so we have chosen to not show them here .",
    "this suggests that our ignorance of the true k - correction does not strongly compromise our conclusions about how color correlates with magnitude and velocity dispersion .",
    "conclusions about evolution , however , do depend on the k - correction .",
    "figure  [ bccolorz ] shows the result of remaking figure  [ cmdensity ] , but now using k@xmath514 , rather than k@xmath515 .",
    "the three panels show the residuals from the color-@xmath4 relation as a function of local density . at each bin in density ,",
    "symbols showing results for higher redshifts have been offset slightly to the right .",
    "the trend for different symbols to slope down and to the right at fixed n indicates that galaxies at higher redshifts are bluer .",
    "comparison with figure  [ cmdensity ] shows that the evidence for evolution in color is present for both k - corrections . however , k@xmath514 yields evolution in @xmath447 of 0.04  mags , and in @xmath449 of 0.07  mags . in comparison , k@xmath515 has changes of 0.07 and 0.03 respectively .",
    "thus , k@xmath514 suggests that the evolution in @xmath449 is larger than in @xmath447 .",
    "this is not the expected trend ; the @xmath447 and @xmath449 wavelength baselines are about the same , so one expects more of the evolution to come in at the bluer color . using k@xmath515",
    "instead suggests that most of the evolution is in @xmath447 , which is more in line with expectations .",
    "we also tried k - corrections from fukugita et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "the predicted early - type colors are redder than those in our sample , the predicted s0 colors are bluer , and the differences depend on redshift . a straight average of the two is an improvement , although the resulting low redshift @xmath447 is red by 0.05  mags .",
    "if we shift by this amount to improve the agreement at low redshifts , then the observed @xmath447 colors at @xmath516 are redder than the predicted no evolution curves by about 0.2 mags .",
    "this is larger than the offset we expect for the selection effect introduced by the magnitude limit , so we decided against presenting further results from these k - corrections .",
    "this appendix describes how we estimated the line - of - sight velocity dispersions @xmath4 for the sample of galaxies selected for this paper .",
    "estimates of @xmath4 are limited by the instrumental dispersion and resolution .",
    "recall that the instrumental dispersion of the sdss spectrograph is 69 kms@xmath69 per pixel , and the resolution is @xmath87 kms@xmath69 .",
    "in addition , the instrumental dispersion may vary from pixel to pixel , and this can affect measurements of @xmath4 . these variations are estimated for each fiber by using arc lamp spectra ( upto 16 lines in the range 3800 - 6170    and 39 lines between 5780 - 9230   ) .",
    "an example of the variation in instrumental dispersion for a single fiber is shown in figure  [ fig : resol ] .",
    "the figure shows that a simple linear fit provides a good description of this variation .",
    "this is true for almost all fibers , and allows us to remove the bias such variations may introduce when estimating galaxy velocity dispersions .    =    a number of methods for making accurate and objective velocity dispersion measurements as have been developed ( sargent et al .",
    "1977 ; tonry & davis 1979 ; franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 ; bender 1990 ; rix & white 1992 ) .",
    "these methods are all based on a comparison between the spectrum of the galaxy whose velocity dispersion is to be determined , and a fiducial spectral template .",
    "this can either be the spectrum of an appropriate star , with spectral lines unresolved at the spectra resolution being used , or a combination of different stellar types , or a high @xmath89 spectrum of a galaxy with known velocity dispersion . in this work ,",
    "we use sdss spectra of 32 k and g giant stars in m67 as stellar templates .",
    "since different methods can give significantly different results , thereby introducing systematic biases especially for low @xmath89 spectra , we decided to use three different techniques for measuring the velocity dispersion .",
    "these are 1 ) the _ cross - correlation _ method ( tonry & davis 1979 ) ; 2 ) the _ fourier - fitting _ method ( tonry & davis 1979 ; franx , illingworth & heckman 1989 ; van der marel & franx 1993 ) ; and 3 ) a modified version of the _ direct - fitting _ method ( burbidge , burbidge & fish 1961 ; rix & white 1992 ) . because a galaxy s spectrum is that of a mix of stars convolved with the distribution of velocities within the galaxy , fourier space is the natural choice to estimate the velocity dispersions ",
    "the first two methods make use of this .",
    "however , there are several advantages to treating the problem entirely in pixel space .",
    "in particular , the effects of noise are much more easily incorporated in the pixel - space based _ direct - fitting _ method . because the @xmath89 of the sdss spectra are relatively low , we assume that the observed absorption line profiles in early - type galaxies are gaussian ( see rix & white 1992 and bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 for a discussion of how to analyze the line profiles of high @xmath89 spectra in the case of asymmetric profiles ) .",
    "it is well known that all three methods have their own particular biases , so that numerical simulations must be used to calibrate these biases . in our simulations , we chose a template stellar spectrum measured at high @xmath89 , broadened it using a gaussian with rms @xmath517 , added gaussian noise , and compared the input velocity dispersion with the measured output value .",
    "the first broadening allows us to test how well the methods work as a function of velocity dispersion , and the addition of noise allows us to test how well the methods work as a function of @xmath89 .",
    "=    the best - case scenario is one in which there is no ` template mismatch ' : the spectrum of the template star is exactly like that of the galaxy whose velocity dispersion one wishes to measure .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsim ] shows the fraction of systematic bias associated with each of the different methods in this best - case scenario .",
    "slightly more realistic simulations , using a combination of stellar spectra as templates , were also done .",
    "the results are similar to those shown in figure  [ fig : vsim ] . with the exception of the _ cross - correlation _ method at low ( @xmath518 kms@xmath69 ) velocity dispersion ,",
    "the systematic errors on the velocity dispersion measurements appear to be smaller than @xmath519 .",
    "=    =    although the systematics are small , note that the measured velocity dispersion is more biased at low velocity dispersions ( @xmath518 kms@xmath69 ) . for any given @xmath89 and resolution , there is a lower limit on the velocity dispersion measurable without introducing significant bias . since the @xmath89 of the sdss spectra is not very high ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : vmeth ] ) , and because the instrumental resolution is @xmath87 kms@xmath69 , we chose 70 kms@xmath69 as a lower limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : vmeth ] shows a comparison of the velocity dispersion estimates obtained from the three different methods for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the median offsets are not statistically significant and the rms scatter is @xmath520 . on the other hand , the top panels suggest that the cross - correlation method sometimes underestimates the velocity dispersion , particularly at low @xmath89 .",
    "we evaluate the dependence of the velocity dispersion on the wavelength range by fitting the spectra in different intervals : @xmath521     which is the usual wavelength range used in the literature ; @xmath522    to test the effect of including the ca h and k absorption lines ( e.g. , kormendy 1982 ) ; @xmath523    to test the effect of including the nad line ( e.g. , dressler 1984 ) ; and @xmath524     and @xmath525    to test the effect of including longer wavelengths",
    ". the velocity dispersion obtained with the ca h and k is @xmath526 larger than that obtained using the standard wavelength region @xmath521   , and the rms difference between the three different methods increases to @xmath527 . including the nad line increases the velocity dispersion by @xmath519 but does not increase the scatter between the different methods . using the wavelength range @xmath524     only provides velocity dispersions which are @xmath519 larger than the values obtained if only @xmath521     range is used . on the other hand , in this wavelength region ,",
    "the different methods ( and measurements from repeated observations ) are in better agreement ; the scatter is @xmath528 smaller than in the @xmath521     region . in the range",
    "@xmath525   , the velocity dispersion estimates increase by @xmath527 .",
    "this last effect is probably due to the presence of molecular bands in the spectra of early - type galaxies at long wavelengths ( i.e. , to the presence of cool stars ) .",
    "furthermore , the scatter in this wavelength region increases dramatically ( @xmath529 ) .",
    "presumably this is due to the presence of higher sky - line residuals and lower @xmath89 .",
    "the estimated velocity dispersion we use in the main text are obtained by fitting the wavelength range @xmath94    and then using the average of the estimates provided by the _ fourier - fitting _ and _ direct - fitting _ methods to define what we call @xmath95 .",
    "we do not use the cross - correlation estimate because of its behavior at low @xmath89 as discussed earlier .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : vrptd ] shows the distribution of the errors on the velocity dispersion as a function of the @xmath89 of the spectra .",
    "the errors for each method were computed by adding in quadrature the statistical error due to the noise properties of the spectrum , and the systematic error associated with the template and galaxy mismatches . the final error on @xmath95",
    "is got by adding in quadrature the errors on the two estimates ( i.e. , the fourier - fitting and direct - fitting ) which we average .",
    "the resulting errors range from @xmath530  dex , depending on the @xmath89 of the spectra , with a median value of 0.03  dex .    a few galaxies in our sample",
    "have been observed more than once .",
    "the bottom panel shows a comparison of the velocity dispersion estimates from multiple observations .",
    "the scatter between different measurements is @xmath98  dex , consistent with the amplitude of the errors on the measurements .",
    "=    =    the sdss spectra measure the light within a fixed aperture of radius 1.5 arcsec .",
    "therefore , the estimated velocity dispersions of more distant galaxies are affected by the motions of stars at larger physical radii than for similar galaxies which are nearby .",
    "if the velocity dispersions of early - type galaxies decrease with radius , then the estimated velocity dispersions ( using a fixed aperture ) of more distant galaxies will be systematically smaller than those of similar galaxies nearby .",
    "we have not measured the velocity dispersion profiles @xmath531 of any of the galaxies in our sample , so we can not correctly account for this effect .",
    "if we assume that the galaxies in our sample are similar to those for which velocity dispersion profiles have been measured , then we can use the published @xmath531 curves to correct for this effect .",
    "this is what equation  ( [ appcorr ] ) in section  [ spectro ] does .",
    "an alternative procedure can be followed if evolution effects are not important for the velocity dispersions in our sample . to illustrate the procedure",
    ", the galaxies in each of the volume - limited subsamples shown in figure  [ fig : xzr ] were further classified into small bins in effective physical radius ( i.e. , @xmath79 in kpc/@xmath532 , not @xmath78 in arcsec ) . figures  [ apcorr1][apcorr3 ] show the result of plotting the velocity dispersions of these galaxies versus their redshifts .",
    "since the galaxies at low and high redshift are supposed to be similar , any trend with redshift can be used to infer and average velocity dispersion profile , and how the shape of this profile depends on luminosity and effective radius . in this way , the sdss data themselves can , in principle , be used to correct for the effects of the fixed aperture of the sdss spectrograph .    in practice , because there is substantial scatter in the velocity dispersions at fixed luminosity and size ( inserting the values from table  [ mlcov ] into the expression for @xmath533 in appendix  [ simul ] shows that this scatter is about 14% ) , the trends in the present data set are relatively noisy .",
    "when the dataset is larger , it may be worth returning to this issue .",
    "for now , because the corrections are small anyway , we have chosen to use equation  ( [ appcorr ] ) to correct the velocity dispersions .",
    "nevertheless , curves like those presented above provide a novel way to study the velocity dispersion profiles of early - type galaxies .",
    "section  [ lf ] showed that , after accounting for the fact that the sdss sample is magnitude - limited , the distribution of @xmath534 was well described by a gaussian .",
    "we would also like to present the intrinsic distributions of @xmath79 and @xmath4 .",
    "to do so , we must study how @xmath79 and @xmath4 are correlated with luminosity , and with each other . in principle",
    ", we could do this by extending the efstathiou , ellis & peterson ( 1988 ) method ( along the lines described by sodr & lahav 1993 ) to obtain a non - parametric maximum - likelihood estimate of the three - dimensional distribution of @xmath1 , @xmath79 and @xmath4 .",
    "the virtue of this approach is that it accounts for the fact that the observed sample is magnitude - limited , that there is also a cut at small velocity dispersions , and that there are correlated measurement errors associated with the luminosities , sizes and velocity dispersions .",
    "we chose not to make a non - parametric estimate of the joint distribution because just ten bins in each of @xmath1 , @xmath79 and @xmath4 yields @xmath535 free parameters to be determined from @xmath536 galaxies . in appendix  [ lx ] we show that , in each of the sdss wavebands , the joint distribution of early - type galaxy luminosities , sizes , and velocity dispersions is well described by a tri - variate gaussian distribution in the variables @xmath534 , @xmath537 and @xmath538 .",
    "thus , we have a simple parametrization of the joint distribution for which , in each waveband , nine numbers suffice to describe the statistical properties of our sample : three mean values , @xmath116 , @xmath115 and @xmath196 , three dispersions , @xmath539 , @xmath540 and @xmath541 , and three pairwise correlations , @xmath542 , @xmath543 , and @xmath544 .    in addition , we will also allow for the possibility that the luminosities are evolving  a tenth parameter to be estimated from the sample .",

    ", errors in these two quantities are correlated .",
    "let @xmath549 denote the error in @xmath550 , and @xmath551 the error in @xmath58 .",
    "the correlation means that we need three numbers to describe the errors associated with the fitting procedure , @xmath552 , @xmath553 , and @xmath554 , but the pipeline only provides two . the error output by the pipeline in @xmath57 , is correctly marginalized over the uncertainty in @xmath58 , so it is essentially @xmath552 .",

    ", we must make an assumption about the correlation between the errors .",
    "fortunately , this can be derived from the fact that , for a wide variety of galaxy profile shapes , the quantity @xmath557 , with @xmath558 , has a very small scatter ( e.g. saglia et al .",

    "we assume that the errors in @xmath56 are neither correlated with those in @xmath550 nor with those in the absolute magnitude .",
    "finally , we assume that errors in magnitudes are not correlated with those in velocity dispersion , so @xmath570 is set to zero , and that errors in size and velocity dispersion are only weakly correlated because of the aperture correction we apply . here",
    "@xmath571 is the error in what was called @xmath572 in the main text .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath188 contains six of the ten free parameters we are seeking .",

    "the maximum - likelihood estimates of these parameters in each band are given in table  [ mlcov ] of section  [ fp ] .",
    "notice that although the luminosity and size distributions differ from band to band , the velocity distributions do not .",

    "this allows us to transform the covariance matrix @xmath188 into the one which describes the fundamental plane . in appendix  [ prjct ]",
    "we show how knowledge of @xmath188 allows us to estimate various pairwise correlations . and in appendix  [ simul ] we use our knowledge of @xmath188 and the evolution parameter @xmath352 to generate mock galaxy catalogs which are similar to our data set .",

    "the distribution of @xmath576 at fixed @xmath1 is shown to be reasonably well described by a gaussian for all the choices of @xmath576 we consider .",

    "let @xmath711 denote the volume of the @xmath52th subsample , and let @xmath712 denote the number of galaxies in it .",
    "a conservative approach is to randomly choose the galaxies in @xmath711 with probability proportional to min@xmath713 , where min@xmath714 denotes the volume of the smallest of the subsamples .",
    "this has the disadvantage of removing much of the data , but , because our data set is so large , it may be that we can afford this luxury .",
    "a more cavalier approach is to choose all the galaxies in the largest @xmath711 , all the galaxies in the other @xmath715 , and to generate a set of additional galaxies by randomly choosing one of the @xmath716 galaxies in @xmath715 , adding to each of its observed parameters a gaussian random variate with dispersion given by the quoted observational error , and repeating this @xmath717 $ ] times .",
    "a final possibility is to weight all the galaxies in @xmath711 ( even those which were not in the volume limited subsample ) by the inverse of the volume in which they could have been observed @xmath718 .",
    "we chose the first , most conservative option .    by piecing together three volume limited subsamples",
    ", we were able to construct composite catalogs of about @xmath535 objects each . because the completeness limits are different in the different bands , the composite catalogs are different for each band .",
    "in addition , because any one composite catalog is got by subsampling the set of eligible galaxies , by subsampling many times , we can generate many realizations of a composite catalog .",

    "<S> the higher redshift population is bluer by an amount which is consistent with the fundamental plane and chemical abundance estimates of the ages of these galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the red light in early - type galaxies is , on average , slightly more centrally concentrated than the blue . because of these color gradients , the strength of the color  magnitude relation depends on whether or not the colors are defined using a fixed metric aperture ; the color@xmath26 relation is less sensitive to this choice .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the principal advangtages of the sdss sample over previous samples is that the galaxies in it lie in environments ranging from isolation in the field to the dense cores of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental plane shows that galaxies in dense regions are slightly different from galaxies in less dense regions , but the co - added spectra and color  magnitude relations show no statistically significant dependence on environment . </S>"
