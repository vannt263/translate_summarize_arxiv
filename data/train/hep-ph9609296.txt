    "processes of heavy quark and lepton pair production on nucleon and nuclear targets at high energies are very interesting from both theoretical and practical reasons .",
    "these processes provide a method to study the internal structure of hadrons in the very small @xmath2-region .",
    "some limits on the possible non - perturbative contributions to this region can also be obtained .",
    "realistic estimates of the cross sections of heavy quark production are necessary in order to plan experiments on the existing and future accelerators .",
    "predictions are usually obtained in the framework of perturbative qcd in the leading and the next - to - leading order @xmath5-expansion . in the case of a nuclear target",
    "it is usually assumed that the cross section of heavy flavour production ( or any other hard process ) , @xmath6 , should be proportional to @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ; that is , in agreement with the most accurate experimental results of [ 1,2 ] , where values of @xmath9 for all @xmath10-meson production by pions at @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 for neutral @xmath10-meson production by protons at @xmath13 gev were obtained , respectively .",
    "however it seems important to consider the problem in more detail because , for example , many experimental results are obtained by extrapolation of results on a nuclear target to a nucleon target .",
    "it is experimentally well - known [ 3 - 9 ] that parton distributions in nuclei ( i.e. , in bound nucleons ) are slightly different from the same distributions in free nucleons .",
    "so the value of @xmath1 can differ from unity and it is interesting to estimate the size of this effect .",
    "also the differences in the distributions of gluons , sea quarks and valence quarks are not the same @xcite . moreover , in different hard processes different qcd subprocesses give the main contributions , so the effects on the @xmath1-values can also be different .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the values of @xmath1 as a function of energy and feynman-@xmath2 for the cases of open charm , beauty and different mass drell - yan pair production in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we showed that the results for the a - dependence of heavy flavour production depend very weakly on the used set of parton distributions .",
    "three different sets , namely mrs-1 @xcite , mt s - dis @xcite and grv ho @xcite , which can be found in cern pdflib @xcite , gave practically the same results for the @xmath1 behaviour ( see table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we present the results for two sets , grv ho @xcite and mrs - a @xcite which are in comparatively good agreement with the new hera data and we see that they give practically identical results for both open heavy flavour and drell - yan pair production in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the standard qcd expression for the cross section of heavy quark production in a hadron 1 - hadron 2 collision has the form    @xmath14\\left [ x_bg_{b/2}(x_b,\\mu^{2})\\right ] \\hat{\\sigma}^{ab\\rightarrow q\\overline{q}}(\\hat{s},m_q,\\mu^{2 } ) \\ ; , \\label{eq : totalpf}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the structure functions of partons @xmath19 and @xmath20 inside hadrons @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , and @xmath23 is the cross section of the subprocess @xmath24 as given by standard qcd .",
    "the latter depends on the parton center - of - mass energy , the mass of the produced heavy quark @xmath25 and the qcd scale @xmath26 .",
    "( [ eq : totalpf ] ) should account for all possible subprocesses @xmath27 .",
    "the parton - parton cross section @xmath28 can be written in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath29    with    @xmath30    and    @xmath31\\;.\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be found in @xcite for heavy flavour production .",
    "formulae with the same structure as ( 1)-(4 ) can be found in @xcite for drell - yan pair production . in this case",
    "@xmath35 plays the role of @xmath36 in @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    for the numerical calculations we wrote the nuclear structure function @xmath40 in the form    @xmath41    similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite and we take the values of @xmath42 for gluons , valence and sea quarks from ref . [ 10 ] .",
    "they are presented in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath42 in [ 10 ] are given for @xmath43 which is not small enough at high energies .",
    "so at @xmath44 we used two variants of the @xmath42 behaviour for gluon and sea quark distributions : the first is the constant frozen at @xmath45 ( dashed - dotted curves for gluons and solid curves for sea quarks in fig .",
    "1 ) . the second is the extrapolation as @xmath46 ( dotted curves in fig .",
    "1 ) of the distribution which gives the main contribution to our cross section , with @xmath47 0.096 and 0.040 for charm and beauty production respectively ( only for gluons ) , and @xmath48 = 0.109 , 0.096 and 0.072 for drell - yan pair invariant masses @xmath49 5 , 25 and 100 gev@xmath50 respectively ( only for sea quarks ) .",
    "such behaviour is in qualitative agreement with the results of @xcite .    in the case of nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "the parton distributions in both incident nuclei should be written in the form ( 5 ) .",
    "it is necessary to note that in such a way the main part of the shadowing processes is taken into account .    9 mm",
    "2 mm    in the case of charm production we have used the values @xmath51 = 1.5 gev and @xmath52 = 4 gev@xmath50 ( @xmath52 = 5 gev@xmath50 for the mrs - a set ) and in the case of beauty production @xmath53 = 5 gev and @xmath52 = @xmath54 .    the obtained results for @xmath1 determined from the ratios of heavy quark production cross section on a gold target and on the proton are presented in fig . 2 for the grv ho and mrs - a sets between these two sets of parton distributions . ] and the two variants of gluon distribution ratios in the small @xmath2-region . here",
    "@xmath55 is the c.m .",
    "energy for the interaction of the incident proton with one target nucleon .",
    "one can see that at fixed target energies the values of @xmath1 are slightly higher than unity , which is not in contradiction with the results of refs . [",
    ". however @xmath1 decreases with increasing energy and this effect is larger in the case of charm production than in the case of beauty .",
    "one can see also that the difference between the two variants for @xmath42 at @xmath44 becomes important only at the highest energies .",
    "we also calculate the values of @xmath1 for different feynman-@xmath2 ( @xmath56 ) regions using @xmath57 at energies @xmath55 = 39 gev and 1800 gev .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "3 . at negative and moderate @xmath56 ( in the nucleus fragmentation region )",
    "the values of @xmath1 are slightly higher than unity .",
    "however in the case of charm production in the beam fragmentation region ( positive @xmath56 ) the values of @xmath1 become essentially smaller than unity . for beauty production",
    "the last effect is expected only at very high energies .",
    "the obtained results for a - dependences of charm and beauty production in the symmetric case of gold - gold collisions are presented in figs . 4 ( @xmath1 as a function of initial energy ) and 5 ( @xmath1 as a function of @xmath56 at two energies ) . here",
    "@xmath55 is the c.m .",
    "energy for one nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "one can see a qualitative agreement with the case of proton - nucleus collisions ( with the difference that the trivial value of @xmath1 is here equal to two ) .",
    "again we can see that the values of @xmath1 are dependent on the initial energy and @xmath56 if the energy is high enough .",
    "calculations for charm production in perturbative qcd ( including preequilibrium charm production from secondary minijet gluons ) can be found in @xcite for central gold on gold collisions .",
    "as said above , the qcd expression for heavy lepton pair production in a hadron 1 - hadron 2 collision has the same form as eq .",
    "( 1 ) but with another matrix element which can be found in ref .",
    "now we have an additional variable  the mass of the produced pair @xmath35 which plays more or less the same role as the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "however now its value can be measured experimentally and do not lead to any uncertainty .",
    "we have used the values of qcd scale @xmath58 .",
    "the obtained results for @xmath1 determined in the same way as in heavy quark production , i.e. , from the ratios of drell - yan pair production cross section in proton - gold and proton - proton collisions , are presented in fig . 6 for the grv ho and mrs - a sets and the two variants of sea quark distribution ratios in the small @xmath2-region . here",
    "again @xmath55 is the c.m .",
    "energy for the interaction of the incident proton with one target nucleon .",
    "contrary to the case of heavy flavour production the values of @xmath1 are never higher than unity .",
    "they decrease more or less monotonically with increasing energy and this effect becomes smaller with increasing @xmath4 mass . again",
    "the two sets of parton distributions give practically identical results for the energy dependence of @xmath1 and the difference between the two variants for @xmath42 at @xmath44 becomes important only at the highest energies .",
    "the predicted @xmath35 dependence of @xmath1 for drell - yan pair production in proton - nucleus collisions at different energies is also shown in fig .",
    "the results of our calculations of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath56 for heavy lepton pair production are presented in fig .",
    "the qualitative picture is similar to the case of heavy flavour production ; the numerical difference of our predictions from the value @xmath8 is here more significant for the case of a not very large mass of the lepton pair .",
    "predictions of a - dependence for drell - yan pair production cross section in symmetric nucleus - nucleus collisions are shown in figs . 8 and 9 .",
    "as for the case of proton - nucleus collisions , all the effects are qualitatively the same but numerically larger than in the case of heavy flavour production .",
    "our results are in agreement with the calculations of @xcite .    9 mm",
    "2 mm    in this paper we calculate the a - dependence of charm and beauty as well as drell - yan pair production using standard qcd formulas and accounting for the difference of parton distributions in free and bound nucleons . if one parametrize these cross sections as @xmath0 , the value of @xmath1 is slightly different from unity at the available energies . for the case of heavy flavour production at comparatively low energies",
    "the obtained values of @xmath1 are a little higher than unity .",
    "this should be connected with some nucleon - nucleon correlations which change the large-@xmath2 parton distributions . in the case of drell - yan pair production such effect",
    "is absent because of the different relations in the contributions of valence quarks , sea quarks and gluons .    at higher energies the values of @xmath1 decrease and",
    "become smaller than unity . at @xmath55",
    "= 1800 gev we expect a value of @xmath59 for charm and low - mass drell - yan pair production .",
    "the decrease of the ratio @xmath42 , which results in a decrease of @xmath1 , can be connected with the effects of parton density saturation @xcite which in heavy nuclei occur at @xmath2-values higher than in the proton .    if we consider two small and different values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the case of proton - nucleus interaction , it is clear that the contribution to the inclusive cross section from the region @xmath62 should be larger than the mirror contribution ( @xmath63 ) because the value of the ratio @xmath42 in the first case is larger .",
    "it means that heavy quark and drell - yan pairs will be produced preferably in the nucleus fragmentation hemisphere , i.e. , asymmetrically , which is quite usual and has been confirmed experimentally in the case of light quark production . from figs . 3 and 7 it is clear that charm and low - mass drell - yan pair production on nuclear targets at lhc energies will give important information on the nuclear shadowing of the structure functions at small @xmath2 .",
    "besides , the experimental measurements of the effects predicted for different hard interactions should allow ( in principle ) to control the validity of the conventional extraction of parton distributions from the experimental dis data .",
    "let us repeat again that almost all nuclear shadowing corrections are accounted for in our calculations because they contribute to the @xmath42 ratios , which have been extracted from the experimental data .",
    "on the other hand these shadowing corrections are not numerically large in the considered hard processes .",
    "so we can assume that the corrections which are not accounted for do not change significantly the obtained results .    in conclusion",
    "we express our gratitude to m.a.braun for useful discussions and both to k.j.eskola and to i.sarcevic for sending us their numerical results .",
