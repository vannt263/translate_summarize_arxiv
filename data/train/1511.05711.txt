    "the brst theory provides the most powerful approach to the quantization of gauge systems @xcite .",
    "it includes the batalin - vilkovisky ( bv ) formalism for lagrangian gauge systems and its hamiltonian counterpart known as the batalin - fradkin - vilkovisky ( bfv ) formalism .",
    "usually , the two formalisms are developed in parallel starting , respectively , from the classical action or the first - class constraints on the phase space of the system . in either case one",
    "applies the homological perturbation theory ( hpt ) to obtain the master action or the classical brst charge at the output .",
    "a relationship between both the pictures of gauge dynamics is established through the dirac - bergmann ( db ) algorithm , which allows one to generate the complete set of first - class constraints by the classical action .",

    ". the arrow symbolizes a hypothetical map or construction connecting the bv and bfv formalisms at the level of generating functionals . as we show below such a map really exists . by making use of the variational tricomplex @xcite",
    ", we propose a direct construction of the classical brst charge from the bv master action .",
    "the construction is explicitly covariant ( even though we pass to the hamiltonian picture ) and generates the full spectrum of bfv ghosts immediately from that of the bv theory .",
    "we also derive a covariant poisson bracket on the extended phase space of the theory , with respect to which the classical brst charge obeys the master equation .",
    "the construction of the covariant poisson bracket is similar to that presented in @xcite , except that our poisson bracket is defined off shell .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the first variational tricomplex for gauge systems was introduced in @xcite as the koszul - tate resolution of the usual variational bicomplex for partial differential equations . using this tricomplex ,",
    "the authors of @xcite were able to relate various lie algebras associated with the global symmetries and conservation laws of a classical gauge system .",
    "our tricomplex is similar in nature but involves the full brst differential , and not its koszul - tate part .",
    "in modern language the classical fields are just the sections of a locally trivial , fiber bundle @xmath1 over an @xmath2-dimensional space - time manifold @xmath3 . the typical fiber @xmath4 of @xmath5 is called the _ target space of fields_. in case the bundle is trivial , i.e. , @xmath6 , the fields are merely the smooth mappings from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to fields associated with vector bundles . in this case the space of fields @xmath7 has the structure of a real vector space .    bearing in mind gauge theories as well as field theories with fermions , we assume @xmath8 to be a @xmath9-graded supervector bundle over the ordinary ( non - graded ) smooth manifold @xmath3 . the grassmann parity and the @xmath9-grading of a homogeneous object @xmath10 will be denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the presence of fermionic fields there is no natural correlation between the grassmann parity and the @xmath13-grading . since throughout the paper",
    "we work exclusively in the category of @xmath14-graded supermanifolds , we omit the boring prefixes `` super '' and `` graded '' whenever possible . for a quick introduction to the graded differential geometry and some of its applications we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the local field theory , the dynamics of fields are governed by partial differential equations .",
    "the best way to account for the local structure of fields is to introduce the variational bicomplex @xmath15 on the infinite jet bundle @xmath16 associated with the vector bundle @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the horizontal and vertical differentials in the bigraded space @xmath19 of differential forms on @xmath16 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 refer to the vertical and horizontal degrees , respectively .",
    "a brief account of the concept of a vatiational bicomplex can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the free variational bicomplex represents thus a natural kinematical basis for defining local field theories . in order to specify dynamics",
