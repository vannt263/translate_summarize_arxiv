    "comet c/2010 x1 ( elenin ) ( hereafter simply `` elenin '' ) was discovered on ut 2010 december 10 as a @xmath019.5 red magnitude object at heliocentric distance @xmath7 = 4.221 au @xcite .",
    "the orbit was soon determined to be that of a long - period comet ( semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination were -7532 au , 1.000064 and 1.84 , respectively ) with perihelion expected at @xmath6 = 0.482 au on ut 2011 september 10 , to be followed soon after by a close approach to earth ( minimum geocentric distance 0.234 au on ut 2011 october 17 ) .",
    "simple ( but unphysical ) power - law extrapolations of the apparent brightness from the discovery epoch gave rise to predictions that elenin would become a bright naked - eye comet near and soon after perihelion .",
    "these predictions at first seemed to be substantiated , as ground - based observers reported rapid brightening in early august to peak visual magnitudes near 8 @xcite .",
    "however , elenin was seen to be fainter on or about ut 2011 august 17 while the morphology was reported to change from centrally condensed to increasingly diffuse .",
    "the comet was last recorded in unpublished observations by amateur astronomers as an extremely diffuse , elongated nebulosity on ut 2011 october 23 , when outbound at @xmath7 = 1.06 au .",
    "in due course , comet elenin disappeared .",
    "other promising long period comets ( for example , c/2012 s1 ( ison ) and c/2011 w3 ( lovejoy ) ) have received considerable observational attention ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the disintegration of these comets is relatively easily understood as a consequence of intense solar heating at their small perihelion distances ( 0.012 au and 0.006 au , respectively ) .",
    "comet elenin , however , disintegrated even before reaching its relatively distant perihelion at 0.48 au , under the action of incident solar fluxes @xmath85000 times smaller than those experienced by ison and lovejoy .",
    "elenin therefore offers a different perspective on the mechanism responsible for the destruction of a long period comet on its approach to perihelion .",
    "fading is recognized as important for understanding the steady - state population of long - period comets ( specifically , it is needed to reconcile @xcite dynamical model with the observed distribution of cometary orbital binding energies ; @xcite ) , but the mechanism responsible for fading is neither well - documented nor well - understood .    despite widespread initial excitement and the spectacular physical development of elenin , we are aware of only one relevant scientific publication in the refereed journals ( korsun et al .  2012 ) . in the present paper , we present calibrated photometric measurements from a range of space - based and ground - based telescopes , documenting the demise of comet elenin .",
    "we use these measurements to interpret the mechanism behind its disappearance .",
    "we obtained comet observations using a mixture of ground - based and space - based telescopes between 2011 february and september in the inbound - lag ( see table [ elenin ] ) .",
    "ground - based photometric monitoring observations of the approach to perihelion were obtained between ut 2011 february and 2011 june using berkeley s katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) . for part of the period of interest",
    ", the solar elongation of comet elenin as seen from earth fell below 30 , effectively precluding ground - based observations .",
    "however , the comet entered the fields of view of cameras onboard the sun - observing spacecraft stereo a and b between 2011 may 16 and september 22 . these spacecraft move in earth - like orbits but are separated from the earth in longitude by large angles @xcite , providing data from non - terrestrial perspectives and complementing the observations from earth .",
    "in addition to their regular sun - pointed observations , a set of targeted measurements was obtained using the stereo b spacecraft .",
    "after the comet reached its peak - brightness in august and became faint in subsequent month prior to perihelion , the canada - france - hawaii telescope was used to conduct a sensitive search for nucleus fragments in october .",
    "lastly , archival measurements from the new technology telescope offered views of the comet at two epochs bracketing peak brightness at the end of july and the end of august .",
    "figures ( [ distance ] ) and ( [ phase ] ) show the comet geometry relative to the ground- and space - based telescopes between 2011 february and september as the comet approached the sun .",
    "the kait is a 0.76 meter telescope located at lick observatory , california , at an altitude of 1283 m @xcite .",
    "the telescope is mostly used for supernova survey observations .",
    "we used kait to monitor the brightness evolution of elenin between ut 2011 february 10 and june 3 .",
    "the kait ccd has dimensions 512@xmath9512 pixels ( 24 @xmath10 m per pixel ) with a field of view 6.8@xmath96.8 ( at 0.8 pixel@xmath11 ) .",
    "the telescope tracks at sidereal rates without guiding , limiting the maximum usable exposures .",
    "comet elenin was observed typically in a sequence of ten images , each of 30 s duration , for a total integration of 300 s per night in the r - band .",
    "the comet trailing does not substantially affect the photometry .",
    "the comet moved with the maximum speed @xmath054hr@xmath11 , leading to negligible image trailing ( @xmath0 0.5  in 30 seconds ) .",
    "we used a photometry aperture 7.5 pixels ( 6 ) in radius for the object and an annulus with inner and outer radii 9 and 12 pixels ( 7.2  to 9.6 ) , respectively , to define the sky background .",
    "photometric calibration was secured using sun - like field stars , identified with the aladin sky atlas and with r - magnitudes taken from the usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "the magnitude uncertainty , typically @xmath20.1 magnitudes , was estimated from the scatter of 10 individual measurements of field stars .",
    "the comet was detected during both regular and targeted observations by the heliospheric imagers ( hi ) on board the twin solar spacecraft stereo a and b @xcite .",
    "on each spacecraft , hi is equipped with two cameras , hi-1 and hi-2 , having small ( @xmath12 ) and large ( @xmath13 ) angular fields of view , respectively .",
    "the camera centers point away from the sun by @xmath14 ( hi-1 ) and @xmath15 ( hi-2 ) .",
    "the spectral passbands of the hi-1 cameras cover wavelengths from 630 to 730 nm , similar to the passband of the johnson r - band filter .",
    "however , the pre - launch calibration indicates about 25% leak from the wavelengths at 300 - 450 nm @xcite . this may result a slight departure from the photometry from r - band .",
    "the stereo hi data are publicly available and were downloaded from the uk solar system data center .",
    "we retrieved level 1.0 data and proceeded to remove the background static coronal brightness using the same median procedure that we developed to study the asteroid phaethon @xcite .",
    "the comet should be in the field of view of the stereo a hi-1 camera between may 16 and june 20 , but we did not detect it because the comet brightness was below the detectable threshold of the camera during this time period . it was estimated that the comet had the brightest magnitude @xmath015 , while the camera threshold is about 12 .",
    "the comet was observed , however , during the special maneuver of stereo b. the wide - field camera , hi-2 , recorded the comet from august 01 to 05 while the narrow field camera , hi-1 , recorded it from august 06 to 12 ( designated hi-1bs ) .",
    "however , we found that the extremely poor angular resolution of the hi-2 camera rendered these data susceptible to excessive contamination by background coma and field objects . as a result",
    ", we elected to not include hi-2 data in the present study . during the regular observations , the comet entered the hi-1/stereo b field of view between august 14 and september 04 ( designated hi-1b ) ; and hi-1/stereo a between september 01 to 22 ( designated hi-1a ) .",
    "figure ( [ appearance ] ) shows the comet appearance in the camera on stereo b.    to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and remove background coronal structures and stars near the comet , we extracted the comet photometry from median images shifted to be centered on the comet . during the targeted observations by stereo b ,",
    "the comet was observed for an hour a day .",
    "we obtained hourly median images of the comet and stars between august 01 and 12 ( hi-1bs ) . in regular stereo b and a observations",
    ", we made median images every 0.5 days from august 14 to september 2 with stereo b ( hi-1b ) , and every 2.4 days with stereo a ( hi-1a ) .",
    "the longer median durations were used to obtain better rejection of background stars as the comet was projected against the milky way as seen from the latter spacecraft .",
    "equivalent median images were calculated for standard stars in the same way as for the comet .",
    "field stars for photometric calibration were selected to be spectrally similar to the sun and spatially close to the comet in the images .",
    "for the hi-1 camera , stars can be found in the secchi star catalog through an idl routine scc_get_stars which is the part of solarsoftware ( ssw ) idl package @xcite . the catalog contains more than 35,000 stars brighter than v = 10 .",
    "it provides the v - magnitude of the stars ; we converted from v to r by subtracting 0.36 ( the color of the sun ) from the measurements .",
    "the stereo hi-1 camera has a pixel size of 70 .",
    "we examined the cometary radial profile , and decided to use a circular aperture 3 pixels ( 210 ) in radius , with the sky background determined in a concentric annulus having inner and outer radii of 6 and 9 pixels ( 7.0  and 10.5 ) for photometry .",
    "the sky annulus may be weakly contaminated by the comet tail but this contamination is preferable to the greatly enlarged uncertainties of measurement which are incurred by the use of larger annuli .",
    "the photometric uncertainties were estimated based on the field star measurements .",
    "these uncertainties depend on the heavily under - sampled point - spread functions of the data and on the residual background brightness .",
    "we searched for elenin observations in the archive data organized by the canadian astronomy data center .",
    "eso s new technology telescope ( ntt ) , a 3.6 m telescope , observed the comet on ut 2011 july 23 and august 28 ( principal investigator olivier hainaut ) .",
    "the comet was observed with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc ) @xcite on ntt in the r - band .",
    "the efosc ccd field of view is 4.1@xmath94.1 , while the image size is 2060@xmath92060 pixels .",
    "the images are binned 2@xmath92 pixels in the archival data giving an effective pixel scale 0.24  ( pixel)@xmath11 .",
    "the telescope was tracking the comet .",
    "figure [ ntt ] shows the comet images from each date , revealing a dramatic change in the morphology between these two observations .",
    "because of the dramatic changes of the comet morphology , we used different photometry apertures for the two dates .",
    "the comet aperture was 140 pixels ( 33.6 ) , and the sky annulus was 150 to 200 pixel for the july data .",
    "the aperture was 350 pixels ( 84.0 ) , and the sky annulus was 350 to 400 pixels for the august data .",
    "we used all bright field stars in the field of view to calibrate the photometry .",
    "the star photometry was extracted using apertures 15 pixels ( 3.6 ) in radius with a concentric sky annulus from 15 to 20 pixels .",
    "three images of the comet were taken on july 23 with exposure time 30 seconds within 3 minutes ( ut 23:20- 23:23 ) , and ten images were taken on august 28 within 11 minutes ( ut 23:20 - 23:31 ) , and exposure times ranged from 3 to 80 seconds . assuming that the comet brightness did not change dramatically on such short timescales , we calculated average magnitudes of the comet observed in the july 23 and august 28 .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated from the scatter of the repeated measurements . in the july 23 data ,",
    "the coma noticably over - spilled the photometry aperture .",
    "however , experiments with different apertures indicate that the derived magnitude is within a few @xmath90.1 magnitudes of the `` total '' magnitude that would be obtained in an aperture of infinite radius . the measurement on august 28 suffers",
    "more from aperture overspill , and should be regarded as a lower - limit to the brightness .",
    "the two data points from ntt are plotted in figure ( [ m_app ] ) along with apparent magnitudes from kait and stereo a and b.      we used the 3.6 meter diameter canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) atop mauna kea , hawaii , to examine elenin on ut 2011 october 22 .",
    "the megacam prime focus imager was used with the r filter to obtain a sequence of images at the expected position of elenin .",
    "megacam houses 36 ccds each containing 2048@xmath94096 pixels of 0.187  angular size , giving a total field of view of 1@xmath9 1 .",
    "the cfht was tracked at non - sidereal rates during the observations so as to follow the motion of the comet against the stars .",
    "simultaneous guiding and non - sidereal tracking was not possible and therefore we limited the exposure duration to 120 s in order to minimize image smear due to open - loop tracking errors .",
    "the observing conditions were excellent , with 0.6  fwhm seeing and photometric skies .",
    "the observations were taken in queue - scheduled mode .",
    "we obtained 22 images on ut 2011 oct 22 .",
    "the ccds within each image were combined using the swarp software and compared visually on a computer .",
    "no candidate objects showing the expected angular motion of elenin were found , down to a limiting magnitude estimated to be @xmath4 = 24.4 . at the expected position of elenin ,",
    "we did not detect a nucleus .      between ut june 25.93 and august 23.39 2011 ,",
    "a number of amateur observers reported sightings of the comet @xcite .",
    "visual magnitudes of active comets , especially when reported by different observers using different instruments , are very difficult to interpret and so we have not used them in the present analysis .",
    "however , the amateur observations do provide a qualitative reference for the comet brightness between may and mid - july when data are available from neither kait nor stereo .",
    "they show that the apparent brightness increased gradually during this time period , consistent with the slow brightening evident in earlier kait data , and reaching a peak on mid - august .    on july 30.153 and 30.249 ,",
    "m. drahus and b. yang detected hcn emission in comet elenin using the james clerk maxwell telescope @xcite .",
    "assuming an isotropic production of gas at velocity 0.5 km s@xmath11 and a boltzmann distribution of energy levels at 50 k , the derived hcn production rate is @xmath16 molecule s@xmath11 .",
    "they noted that the hcn production is comparable to the mean level measured in comet 103p / hartley at the same ( 1.07 au ) heliocentric distance in late 2010 @xcite . at this time",
    "the estimated visual magnitude was @xmath09.7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "during the same period , the comet s trajectory was nearly on the same plane as the earth s orbit and its minimum distance to stereo b was only 0.05 au .",
    "the spacecraft was literally within reach of the comet tail ; the plastic instrument on stereo b directly detected suprathermal pickup h@xmath17 and he@xmath17 and singly charged water group ions produced by outgassing from the comet @xcite . while serving to confirm that the comet was a significant source of water at the end of july , it is not practical to use the plasma detections alone to estimate the production rate .",
    "the comet was too close to the sun to be seen from the earth in 2011 september .",
    "a search on ut october 9.5 and 10.6 , using the faulks telescope north having a field of view 10@xmath910 , met with no success @xcite .",
    "on ut oct .",
    "21.38 and 21.48 , the same observers reported a detection of a large and diffuse cloud 4.3 from the predicted comet position in the east - northeast direction ( position angle 77 ) .",
    "this observation was made with the gras 0.1-m f/5 apo refractor at the mayhill station in new mexico ( field - of - view 3.9@xmath92.6 ; scale 3.5   ( pixel)@xmath11 ) .",
    "the large blob moved with the predicted comet motion in the sky . on oct .",
    "23.4 . with the same telescope",
    ", @xcite confirmed the  extremely faint and diffused blob \" with an extended size 1.5@xmath910.0 .",
    "this blob appears to be the expanded and diluted remnant of the post - break - up dust cloud imaged at ntt on ut 2011 august 28 ( figure [ ntt ] ) .    on november 8.12 ,",
    "the amateur astronomer bernard husler , in germany , took images at the predicted location of comet elenin .",
    "he used a 30-cm schmidt - cassegrain with a field of view 29.7@xmath920.0 and the pixel scale 1.63 .",
    "the comet was not detected .",
    "our observations make it clear that elenin did not conform to the simple power - law brightening model used to make optimistic predictions in 2010 and 2011 . in this section",
    ", we examine the brightness variations and attempt to use them to diagnose physical processes occurring at the comet .",
    "the apparent magnitude of the comet is shown as a function of time in figure [ m_app ] .",
    "the magnitudes were determined using different photometry apertures and with the comet at different distances from the telescopes .",
    "therefore , the apparent magnitudes are strictly not comparable , since they sample different volumes of space around the nucleus and different amounts of encircled dust . to take account of this",
    ", we first make an `` aperture correction '' , in which the apparent magnitudes are scaled to the magnitudes which would be observed if each telescope could sample a fixed volume ( represented by a sphere of fixed radius ) around the nucleus .",
    "for this purpose , we arbitrarily scale the photometry to estimate the magnitude that would have been obtained if the comet were observed using a 100  aperture from a distance of 1 au ( corresponding to a linear radius of 73,000 km ) .    to make the aperture correction , we need to know how the coma surface brightness , @xmath18 , varies as a function of the photometry aperture radius , @xmath19 .",
    "isotropic coma expansion at constant speed would give @xmath20 with @xmath21 = 1.0 , while acceleration of the dust under a constant radiation pressure gives a steeper gradient , @xmath21 = 1.5 @xcite .",
    "in the former case , the encircled dust coma cross - section ( and , therefore , the brightness ) grows with radius as @xmath22 , and in the latter as @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting aperture correction is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath19 is the photometry aperture radius in arcseconds , @xmath25 is the observer to comet distance in au and @xmath26 2 .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the coma was measured by @xcite on ut 2011 march 28 .",
    "they found a power - law relation with @xmath21 = 1.56@xmath20.01 , close to the value expected for a radiation - pressure swept coma .",
    "unfortunately , the coma was not well resolved in the kait data owing to the surface brightness sensitivity being limited by the short exposures and the brightness of the sky on mount hamilton .",
    "surface brightness measurements in stereo data are also limited by the large pixel size ( 70  pixel@xmath11 ) and the bright , near - sun background of coronal and scattered photospheric light .",
    "we assume that the kait and stereo observations of elenin can be well - represented by @xmath21 = 1.5 , although we strictly possess evidence validating this assumption only around the time of the @xcite observation .",
    "the coma is fully resolved in the ntt data , where measurements within circular , concentric apertures show that the inner surface brightness on ut 2011 july 23 is best described by @xmath21 = 1.0 .",
    "the ntt data from ut 2011 august 28 are insufficient to permit a meaningful determination of @xmath21 , owing to the low surface brightness of the extended debris trail on this date . to be consistent with july data by ntt , we take @xmath27 for the august ntt comet image .",
    "evidence that the aperture correction is at least approximately correct is provided by figure [ mr1a_100 ] , in which data from different apertures and different telescopes are seen to overlap within the uncertainties of measurement .",
    "the kait , hi 1a , 1b , 1bs and ntt data are all broadly consistent in the figure even though they employed quite different photometric apertures and were taken at different telescope - to - comet - distances .",
    "a grave error in the aperture correction would cause a mis - match between datasets taken from different observatories . even after the aperture correction ,",
    "an error is incurred because distant parts of the comet are excluded by the use of a finite aperture including the sky contamination by the coma .",
    "this error is modest ( a few tenths of a magnitude or less ) until the middle of august , when the morphology changes from centrally - condensed to diffuse .",
    "a compensating factor is that the post - peak photometry used very large apertures ( 210  in radius ) but it is still true that the post - peak measurements should properly be regarded as setting a lower limit to the integrated brightness of the whole coma .",
    "the use of still larger apertures is precluded by the increased sky noise introduced by the bright background of coronal and scattered light , as well as by imperfectly removed field objects .",
    "we used the aperture correction and the inverse square law to calculate the absolute magnitude of the comet at a given phase angle ( i.e.  the magnitude corrected to @xmath7= @xmath25 = 1 au ) from    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the apparent magnitude and @xmath30 is from equation ( [ aperture ] ) .",
    "the aperture and distance - corrected magnitudes of the comet are plotted in figure ( [ fm11a ] ) .",
    "variations in the photometry shown there result from a combination of the effects of real changes in the scattering cross - section of the dust within the scaled photometry aperture and changes due to the angle - dependence of the efficiency of the dust scattering ( the so - called `` phase function '' ) .",
    "as the comet approached the sun , it entered a strongly forward - scattering geometry , reaching the maximum phase angle @xmath31 as observed from stereo b ( figure [ phase ] ) . while sun - grazing comets are often observed by lasco / soho at moderate to large phase angles",
    ", ground - based telescopes are rarely able to point near the sun and so large phase angle observations are rare .",
    "the current record for maximum phase angle is held by p/2003 t12 observed at @xmath32 = 177.6  ( hui 2013 ) .",
    "observations of comets at large phase angles show that the dust is strongly forward - scattering @xcite .",
    "we first fitted a gaussian function to the portion of the aperture- and distance - corrected light curve near the photometric maximum , between ut august 06.3 and 18.5 .",
    "the best fit gives the date of peak brightness as ut 2011 august 12.95 .",
    "the uncertainty of the peak date is about 0.5 days estimated by a visual examination .",
    "the maximum phase angle of the comet , @xmath33 , occurred on ut 2011 august 13 as viewed from stereo b. this coincidence between the dates of maximum brightness and maximum phase angle is a strong evidence that the main brightness peak in figures ( [ m_app ] ) , ( [ mr1a_100 ] ) and ( [ fm11a ] ) is caused by the cometary dust phase function and the forward - scattering observational geometry , not by a true outburst in the comet .",
    "@xcite inferred breakup on ut 2011 august 16@xmath24 , consistent with our estimate .",
    "the comet brightened by @xmath03 magnitudes due to the phase angle effect ( figure [ fm11a ] ) . however , the light curve is not completely symmetric about the maximum phase angle , presumably because of the sudden release of debris caused by the breakup of the nucleus ( as witnessed by the dramatic change in the morphology of the comet near this time - see figure ( [ ntt ] ) ) . to derive a phase function",
    ", we use the portion of the photometry data taken by kait , hi-1bs and ntt before the maximum phase angle of the comet .",
    "this is the time period in which we can reasonably assume that there was no outburst based on the observations .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a compound henyey - greenstein ( hg ) function @xcite to represent the comet dust .",
    "the hg function has no physical basis , but is useful to provide an empirical fit to the phase functions of dust :    @xmath34\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the normalized flux ; @xmath36 is the scattering angle ( the deviation of the ray from the forward direction ) , @xmath37 is the dust grain albedo , and @xmath38 is the asymmetry factor , defined by @xmath39 .",
    "physically , @xmath40 is the scattered intensity weighted by @xmath41 averaged over the entire solid angle .",
    "the hg function is normalized such that the integral over @xmath42 steradians is unity : @xmath43 d\\phi=1 $ ] .",
    "large positive ( negative ) values of @xmath40 represent strong forward ( back ) scattering .",

    ". a @xmath50 fit yields values for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 with a=0.1 . the large @xmath55 is a result of forward scattering by particles much larger than the wavelength of observation . for comparison , ( mostly sub - micron ) dust in the interstellar medium",
    "has a more modest @xmath56 0.5 to 0.6 @xcite . the fitted hg function is plotted in fig ( [ m11a_hg ] ) . @xcite",
    "re - normalized the compound henyey - greenstein function at the phase angle @xmath57 as the dust scattering function .",
    "the `` partitioning coefficient '' @xmath58 in his work is equal to the ratio @xmath59 ) in the current work .",
    "we obtain @xmath60 .",
    "this is smaller than the value 0.95 used by @xcite indicating that comets do not share a single phase function , presumably because their dust properties differ .",
    "based on the best - fit hg function , the brightness of the comet that would have been observed in pure forward - scattering ( @xmath61 ) is 120 times that of the backscattered brightness ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "our best estimate of the pre - perihelion absolute magnitude ( i.e.  corrected to @xmath63 au and to @xmath32 = 0 ) is @xmath64 = 11.7 .",
    "figure ( [ m11a_hg2 ] ) shows how the comet brightness varied with the phase angle , this time plotted so as to distinguish the pre - phase - angle - maximum and post - phase - angle - maximum legs of the orbit .",
    "post - phase - angle - maximum brightening relative to the phase curve is evident , with a local maximum near @xmath65 140 .",
    "the relation between the absolute magnitude and the effective scattering cross section of the dust , @xmath66 , ( in km@xmath3 ) is by @xcite    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the geometric albedo , which we take to be 0.04 ( representative of the albedos measured for the nuclei of comets ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude ( i.e.  with both the aperture correction and the distance correction taken into account ) is shown as a function of time in figure ( [ m110 ] ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude remained unchanged at @xmath69 11.7@xmath20.5 from ut 2011 february through august ( 40 @xmath70 230 ) , in data from the kait , ntt and hi-1bs .",
    "substituting @xmath64 = 11.7 and including a small correction for the color ( we assume v - r = 0.36 ) , we find @xmath66 = 570@xmath2300 km@xmath3    in figure ( [ m110 ] ) the main forward - scattering peak centered on august 13 is gone , but a separate and later peak appears at the end of august . figure ( [ m110p ] ) is an enlargement of figure ( [ m110 ] ) showing the stereo and ntt data recording this peak .",
    "we again fitted this second peak with a gaussian profile , finding a center on ut 2011 august 30.14 at @xmath71 and a full width at half maximum @xmath012.2 days .",

    "therefore , sublimation losses can not be directly responsible for the shrinkage and disappearance of the nucleus of elenin , which requires @xmath157 = 1 .",
    "this is unlike the case of sun - grazing comets ( i.e.  those which reach perihelion distances of a few solar radii ) .",
    "many of these bodies have dimensions of order 10 meters @xcite , and are small enough to simply sublimate away .",
    "comet elenin also disintegrated too far from the sun for tidal stresses to have played a role ( the roche radius for a nucleus of density 1000 kg m@xmath154 is @xmath158 0.01 au ) .",
    "gas pressures produced by sublimation and ram pressure with the solar wind are likewise both utterly negligible at @xmath7 = 0.7 au .",
    "it has been suggested that torques exerted by the loss of material from the nucleus can lead to rotational breakup , and that rotational disruption is the likely dominant mode of destruction of comets .",
    "observationally , @xcite has noted that intrinsically faint ( presumably small nucleus ) long - period comets with perihelia @xmath1520.5 au vanish with higher probability than bright ( presumably large nucleus ) long - period comets .",
    "rotational breakup is especially effective for small cometary nuclei , suggesting that it may be responsible for the demise of elenin and small long - period comets , generally .",
    "accordingly , we examine the hypothesis that the disintegration of elenin was precipitated by a rotational instability .    mass lost from a nucleus",
    "results in a change in the angular momentum , given by @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the mass lost , @xmath161 is the outflow speed at which the mass leaves , and @xmath123 is the nucleus radius .",
    "dimensionless parameter @xmath162 is the ratio of the moment arm for the torque to the nucleus radius .",

    "we take @xmath163 10@xmath165 , to reflect the dispersion in these values .",
    "we identify @xmath160 with the mass of a spherical shell on the nucleus , @xmath166 , where @xmath122 is the nucleus density and @xmath167 is the thickness of the shell .",

    "the angular momentum of the nucleus is @xmath169 , where @xmath170 = 2/5 for a homogeneous sphere of mass @xmath171 and @xmath172 is the angular frequency of rotation at initial period @xmath173 .",
    "we substitute @xmath174 and set @xmath175 to estimate the thickness of the layer which must be lost to modify the nucleus angular momentum by a factor of order unity ;    @xmath176    we substitute @xmath161 = 500 m s@xmath11 corresponding to the sound speed at 200 k , the approximate equilibrium temperature of ice freely sublimating at 1 au .",
    "we assume @xmath173 = 5 hr , typical of kilometer - sized small bodies , @xmath162 = 10@xmath177 and @xmath123 = 600 m to find 0.3 @xmath178 30 m. this is very approximate , not least because several of the parameters in equation ( [ torque ] ) are unmeasured . nevertheless , it is permissible to note that for most observationally allowed choices of the parameters , the equation gives @xmath179 , meaning that only a tiny fraction of the nucleus radius needs to be shed in order to change the angular momentum by a large factor .",
    "for comparison , the destruction of the nucleus by sublimation alone requires @xmath180 , does not lead to a sudden break - up , and takes much longer than the time taken by elenin to travel from its discovery distance to perihelion .    the range 0.3 @xmath178 30 m is shown in yellow in figure ( [ ice_loss ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that both the low and high temperature model curves , shown as blue and red lines , respectively , cross into the yellow shaded zone at pre - perihelion distances about 1.5 au and 2.5 au , respectively .",

    "the peak of this brightness surge is coincident with the passage of the comet through maximum phase angle ( @xmath181172.6  on doy 225 ) , showing that it is caused by strong forward - scattering by cometary dust , not by outburst or nucleus disintegration .",
    "a previously undetected , much smaller brightness surge of @xmath03 magnitudes occurred on ut 2011 august 30 ( doy 242 ) , about 17 days after the forward - scattering peak .",
    "this peak is unrelated to the phase angle and instead represents the true breakup of the nucleus , which began at heliocentric distance @xmath7 = 0.74 au on ut 2011 august 18@xmath21 ( doy 230@xmath21 ) , some 23@xmath21 days before perihelion on ut september 10 ( doy 253 ) .",
    "the dust cross - section is estimated 4300@xmath2900 km@xmath3 at the peak of the brightness surge .",
    "3 .   the measured gas production rates are consistent with equilibrium sublimation from an area @xmath01 km@xmath3 , providing a crude estimate of the pre - disruption radius of the nucleus @xmath112 0.6 km .",
    "deep images after the breakup set an upper limit to radius of surviving fragments near 40 m ( geometric albedo 0.04 assumed ) .",
    "the increase in the cross - section implied by the brightening is consistent with breakup of a 0.6 km radius spherical nucleus into a power - law distribution of fragment sizes .",
    "we find a power - law index @xmath6 = 3.3@xmath20.2 , such that half of the scattering cross - section lies within sub - micron dust particles while most of the mass is in large particles , up to the limiting size established by cfht observations .",
    "the pre - perihelion disintegration of comet elenin starting at about 0.7 au can not be explained by simple sublimation losses , by gravitational stresses or by sublimation stresses .",

    "<S> we find that most of the surge in brightness in mid - august resulted from dust particle forward - scattering , not from a sudden increase in the activity . </S>",
    "<S> a much smaller ( @xmath03 magnitudes ) brightening began on ut 2011 august 18@xmath21 ( heliocentric distance 0.74 au ) , reached a maximum on ut 2011 august 30@xmath21 ( at 0.56 au ) , and reflects the true break - up of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this second peak was matched by a change in the morphology from centrally condensed to diffuse . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated cross - section of the nucleus when at 1 au inbound was @xmath01 km@xmath3 , corresponding to an equal - area circle of radius 0.6 km . </S>",
    "<S> observations were taken after the second peak using the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m telescope to search for surviving fragments of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> none were found to a limiting red magnitude @xmath4 = 24.4 , corresponding to radii @xmath540 m ( red geometric albedo = 0.04 assumed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the brightening , the progressive elongation of the debris cloud and the absence of a central condensation in data taken after ut 2011 august 30 are consistent with disintegration of the nucleus into a power law size distribution of fragments with index @xmath6 = 3.3@xmath20.2 combined with the action of radiation pressure . in such a distribution , </S>",
    "<S> the largest particles contain most of the mass while the smallest particles dominate the scattering cross - section and apparent brightness . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate about physical processes that might cause nucleus disruption in a comet when still 0.7 au from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> tidal stresses and devolatilization of the nucleus by sublimation are both negligible at this distance . </S>",
    "<S> however , the torque caused by mass loss , even at the very low rates measured in comet elenin , is potentially large enough to be responsible by driving the nucleus to rotational instability . </S>"
