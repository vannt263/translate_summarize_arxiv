    "the presence of an ionized absorber was first discovered in observations of the quasar mr 2251 - 178 ( halpern 1984 ) . with the improved spectral resolution of and _ asca _ ,",
    "many more were found .",
    "so far , they revealed their existence mainly in the soft x - ray spectral region , via absorption edges of highly ionized metal ions .",
    "their physical state , location and relation to other components of the active nucleus is still rather unclear .",
    "e.g. , an accretion disk wind and various blr related models have been suggested .",
    "warm absorbers have been observed in @xmath050% of the well - studied seyfert galaxies and some quasars .",
    "characteristic x - ray absorption edges also show up in quite a number of nlsy1 galaxies ( e.g. , leighly et al .",

    "1998 ) and we focus on this sub - group in the present contribution .",
    "we use the definition of nlsy1 ` loosely ' , i.e. , we include the quasar iras13349 + 2438 which shares some similarities with nlsy1s ( brandt et al .",
    "1996 , b96 hereafter ) .",
    "recently , evidence has accumulated that some warm absorbers contain significant amounts of dust ( b96 , komossa & fink 1996 , reynolds 1997 , komossa & fink 1997b - d , reynolds et al .",
    "1997 , leighly et al .",
    "1997 , komossa & bade 1998 , komossa 1998 ) .",
    "the possibility of a _ dusty _ warm absorber in iras13349 was suggested by b96 to explain the lack of excess x - ray _ cold _ absorption despite strong optical reddening ( for follow - up observations see brinkmann et al .",
    "1996 , brandt et al . 1997 ) . as emphasized by komossa & fink ( kofi hereafter , e.g. 1997a , b ) and komossa & bade ( koba , 1998 ) the influence of the presence of dust on the x - ray absorption spectrum can be strong and becomes drastic for high column densities @xmath4 .",
    "signatures of the presence of ( galactic - ism - like ) dust are , e.g. , a strong carbon edge in the x - ray spectrum , and a stronger temperature gradient across the absorber with more gas in a ` cold ' state .    here , we apply the model of a _ dusty _ warm absorber to the x - ray spectrum of iras 13349 . although repeatedly suggested , such a model has not been fit previously ( for some results see komossa 1998 ) . given the potentially strong modifications of the x - ray absorption spectrum in the presence of dust , it is important to scrutinize whether a dusty warm absorber is consistent with the observed x - ray spectrum . since some strong features of dusty warm absorbers appear outside the sensitivity range , data are best suited for this purpose ; we used the pointed pspc observation of dec . 1992 .",
    "as ionizing continuum illuminating the warm absorber we adopted a mean seyfert spectrum consisting of piecewise powerlaws ( as in kofi 1997b ) with energy index @xmath5 .",
    "we use as definition for the ionization parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the photoionization calculations were carried out with ferland s ( 1993 ) code _",
    "cloudy_.    in a first step ,",
    "we fit a dust-_free _ warm absorber ( as in b96 , but using the additional information on the hard x - ray powerlaw available from the asca observation , @xmath7 ) .",
    "this gives an excellent fit with log @xmath4=22.7 ( @xmath8 = 0.8 ) .",
    "if this same model is re - calculated by fixing @xmath4 and the other best - fit parameters but _ adding dust _ to the warm absorber the x - ray spectral shape is drastically altered and the data can not be fit at all ( @xmath8 = 150 ) .",
    "this still holds if we allow for non - standard dust , i.e. , selectively exclude either the graphite or silicate species .",
    "it has to be kept in mind , though , that the expected column derived from optical extinction is less than the x - ray value of @xmath4 determined under the above assumptions .",
    "therefore , in a next step , we allowed all parameters ( except ) to be free and checked , whether a dusty warm absorber could be fit .",
    "this is not the case ( e.g. , if @xmath4 is fixed to log @xmath9 = 21.2 we get @xmath8 = 40 ) .",
    "the bad fit results can be partially traced back to the ` flattening ' effect of dust ( cf .",
    "fig . 4 of koba 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , if we allow for a steeper intrinsic powerlaw spectrum , with @xmath10 much steeper than the value , a dusty warm absorber with @xmath11 , the value derived from optical reddening , fits the spectrum well ( @xmath8 = 1.2 , tab .",
    "1 ) . we also analyzed the survey data and find the same trends ; i.e. , the requirement of a steep intrinsic spectrum .",
    "at present , there are several possible explanations for the _ rosat_-spectral differences : ( i ) variability in a _ two_-component warm absorber , ( ii ) variability in the intrinsic powerlaw , or ( iii ) remaining _ rosat_-inter - calibration uncertainties .    the presence of a _ dusty _ warm absorber in the nlsy1-like quasar iras 13349 and the nlsy1 galaxy iras 17020 + 4544 ( leighly et al .",
    "1997 , koba 1998 ) further adds to the spectral complexity in nlsy1 galaxies . whereas early nlsy1 models tried to explain their very _ steep _ observed x - ray spectra by only one component ( either a strong soft excess , or a warm absorber , or an intrinsically steep spectrum )",
    ", there is now evidence that often all three components are simultaneously present , and the additional presence of _ dusty _ material partly compensates the ` steepening effect ' of the other three .",
    "the detection of dust absorption features in the x - ray spectra of active galaxies with future x - ray missions will be an important check and confirmation of the existence of _ dusty _ warm absorbers , and will provide an interesting approach to investigate dust properties in other galaxies .",
    "but not all warm absorbers contain dust .",

    "the nlsy1 galaxy ngc4051 harbours a warm absorber of high column density . in this case , only a dust - free warm absorber fits the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this can be traced back to the strong modifications of the absorption structure in the presence of dust .    during a deep pspc x - ray observation of nov .",
    "1993 the flux of ngc4051 turned out to be strongly variable , the warm absorption features remained constant .",
    "this can be used to derive a constraint on the density and location of the ionized material , which yields @xmath14@xmath15 and @xmath16 cm ( see kofi 1997a for details ) .    to investigate the long - term trend in the variability of ngc4051 , in count rate as well as in ionization parameter @xmath12 and column density @xmath4 of the warm absorber , we analyzed previously unpublished pspc observations of ngc4051 and",
    "also re - analyzed data earlier presented in mchardy et al .",
    "we find that in the long term all features are variable , except for the cold absorption which is always consistent with the galactic value within the error bars . @xmath12 and @xmath4 change by about a factor of 2 .",

    "the source s count rate , 0.44 cts / s , is constant throughout the observation .",
    "a successful description of the steep observed spectrum is a warm - absorbed flat powerlaw of canonical index .",
    "we find a very large column density @xmath4 in this case , and the contribution of emission and reflection is no longer negligible ; there is also some contribution to fe k@xmath20 . for the pure absorption model ,",
    "the best - fit values for ionization parameter and warm column density are @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( @xmath19 is consistent with the galactic value ) , with @xmath23 = 0.74 . including the contribution of emission and reflection for 50% covering of the warm material gives @xmath24 ( @xmath23 = 0.65 ) .",
    "several strong euv emission lines are predicted to arise from the warm material .",

    "this kind of spectral variability is naturally predicted within the framework of warm absorbers , making the object a very good candidate for warm absorption .",
    "we find that a warm - absorbed , intrinsically flat powerlaw can indeed describe the survey observation . due to the low number of available photons , a range of possible combinations of @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath4 explains the data with comparable success . a large column density @xmath4 ( of the order 10@xmath33 @xmath34 ) is needed to account for the ultrasoft observed spectrum .",
    "the most suggestive scenario within the framework of warm absorbers is a change in the _ ionization state _ of ionized material along the line of sight , caused by _ varying irradiation _ by a central ionizing source . in the simplest case",
    ", lower intrinsic luminosity would be expected , in order to cause the deeper observed absorption in 1990 , whereas the source is somewhat brighter in the survey observation ( see komossa & fink 1997d for details ) .",
    "some variability seems to be usual , though : the count rate changed by about a factor of 2 during the pointed observation ( fig .",
    "if one wishes to keep this scenario , one has to assume that the ionization state of the absorber still reflects a preceding ( unobserved ) low - state in intrinsic flux .",
    "alternatively , gas heated by the central continuum source may have _ crossed the line of sight _",
    ", producing the steep survey spectrum , and has ( nearly ) disappeared in the 1992 observation . finally , we note that an alternative explanation of the spectral variability in terms of a variable soft excess was suggested by grupe ( 1996 ) ; see also mannheim et al .",
