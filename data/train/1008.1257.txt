    "the superconducting state of the underdoped cuprates shows anomalous properties when compared with the case of optimum or overdoped .",

    "the model of yang , rice , and zhang@xcite ( yrz ) on which this work is based , has the pseudogap forming about the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone ( afbz ) boundary with its own characteristic energy scale .",
    "this model is different in many respects from other competing order proposals such as d - density waves@xcite and from a preformed pair model@xcite which involves a single energy scale . for a review of the successes of the yrz model in understanding the data ,",

    "many more details can be found in references @xcite it is important to understand that this work goes beyond extensions of bcs theory to include effects such as strong coupling due to inelastic scattering@xcite and possible anisotropy@xcite beyond a simple @xmath0-wave superconducting gap .    in a previous work@xcite",
    ", we showed that the strong suppression of the specific heat jump at @xmath8 and corresponding reduction in condensation energy with increased underdoping can be understood as due to the emergence of a pseudogap . here",
    "we consider the equally anomalous observation that the slope of the linear in temperature law as @xmath9 is a strongly increasing function of doping @xmath6 in the overdoped regime while it is nearly constant at underdoping.@xcite while the overdoped case is characteristic of a fermi liquid , the underdoped case requires a new ingredient for its understanding . in addition , we will also consider the recent data of wen et al.@xcite on bi@xmath2sr@xmath10la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 for which @xmath8 at optimum is only 30k and thus superconductivity can be quenched with a 9 tesla magnetic field providing access to the normal state as a function of doping in both fermi liquid ( overdoped ) and pseudogap ( underdoped ) state .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present the essential elements of the theory of yrz@xcite needed for the calculation of the specific heat . both pseudogap state alone and with the addition of superconductivity within a bcs formulation are considered . for @xmath6",
    "greater than @xmath11 , the doping at which the qcp associated with the pseudogap formation is set , the fermi surface is the usual large open contour of band theory and of a fermi liquid . for @xmath12 , however , the fermi surface reconstructs into luttinger pockets which progressively shrink in size as the mott insulating state is more closely approached .",
    "a consequence of this is that the density of states at the fermi level is reduced .",
    "in addition , a gutzwiller factor enters the theory which accounts for the depletion of the coherent part of the electronic green s function due to increased correlations which eventually cause the transition to an insulating state . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our results for the specific heat difference between superconducting and normal state as a function of temperature for values of doping ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 with @xmath13 the critical doping at optimum which is also the qcp in our model . the zero temperature limit of the specific heat difference is also considered more explicitly and compared with the density of states and the data of wen et al.@xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that while pseudogap formation strongly affects the overall temperature dependence of the specific heat , it does not change its slope at low @xmath1 .",
    "this arises because this linear law only depends on the band structure near the dirac point on the heavily weighted part of the fermi surface in the nodal direction and this point is not changed by pseudogap formation in the model of ref .",

    "the size of the slope depends directly on the gutzwiller factor @xmath14 which gives the magnitude of the remaining coherent part of the green s function .",
    "it also depends on the ratio of the superconducting gap to critical temperature which is expected to strongly increase with decreasing doping @xmath6 for @xmath12.@xcite these two effects combined lead to a rather constant value of the slope over a significant range of doping . for overdoping , fermi liquid theory is recovered and in this case the slope shows much greater variation with @xmath6 as in experiment .",

    "@xcite . returning to the rapid drop around @xmath94",
    ", we find that it is displaced to slightly lower values of @xmath6 in the data as compared to theory and we take this to mean that in bi@xmath2sr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 the qcp associated with the start of pseudogap formation occurs at a doping level close but slightly below optimum .",
    "it is important to realize that in the present model , the point at which the value of the density of states at the fermi level @xmath78 begins to be strongly reduced by the growth of the pseudogap , is not exactly at the qcp but is instead displaced to smaller @xmath6 values .",
    "the physics of this displacement is easily understood with reference to the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "first we show , in the main frame , that our numerical results for @xmath78 versus @xmath6 ( triangles ) are very close to the solid black circles as they must be .",
    "these were obtained not from an extrapolation to zero temperature of a specific heat calculation as were the solid circles but instead from the full dos @xmath59 versus @xmath95 shown in the inset .",
    "this good agreement is taken as providing a check on our numerical work .",
    "more significantly it is important to realize that the fermi surface reconstruction from the large open fermi liquid surface of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( @xmath38 ) to a luttinger hole pocket does not immediately lead to change in the value of @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , as can be seen clearly in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , at @xmath37 the dos at @xmath84 is hardly changed from its fermi liquid value ( see solid black curve for @xmath38 for comparison ) .",
    "rather the effect of the pseudogap is to provide a depletion of states at negative @xmath95 . for @xmath96",
    "however , the upper edge of this depletion region which is rather sharp , has moved across the fermi energy and @xmath78 has become significantly reduced as shown in the triangles of the main frame in fig .  [ fig3](a ) .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "the dos at @xmath84 depends on the luttinger contours of zero energy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . at @xmath37 , there are both hole and electron pockets and the number of states having zero energy is not very different from the number when the large open fermi surface applies .",
    "it is only when we reach a single small hole pocket and no electron pockets that depletion of states at @xmath84 becomes significant . on the face of it",
    ", one might even think that more zero energy states are involved when @xmath37 than when @xmath38 because the length of the fermi surface is larger when there are pockets .",
    "but this is not so because , as we have already stated , parts of the luttinger contours carry very little weight .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , we show results for the jump at @xmath8 of the specific heat @xmath76 ( circles ) and its slope out of @xmath8 ( squares ) as a function of doping . we note that for the jump @xmath76 , a notable drop occurs almost immediately below optimum @xmath38 , which can be used to identify the qcp . for the slope ,",
    "the signature of the qcp is not as sharp , only a change in curvature arises at @xmath38 .",
    "these results are to be contrasted with those in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . if one were to estimate the value of doping to be associated with the qcp from the behavior of @xmath66 at @xmath9 , it is necessary to account for a significant displacement downward towards smaller values of @xmath6 of the rapid drop in @xmath78 as compared to the value of @xmath6 at the qcp .",
    "thus extracting a qcp from thermodynamics requires some care but it clearly can be done either from the jump at @xmath8 or the value of the difference @xmath66 as @xmath9 .",
    "we now consider the low temperature behavior of the superconducting state specific heat @xmath97 which is emphasized in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a)-(d ) for underdoped cases .",
    "we base our discussion on the physics of the schematic shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](e ) .",
    "the luttinger pockets are shown as heavy black lines for @xmath37 which has electron as well as hole areas .",
    "also shown is a dirac cone centered on the highly weighted fermi surface contour in the nodal direction .",
    "the cone illustrates the quasiparticle energies at low energy in the superconducting state as a function of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the brillouin zone . only the upper right quadrant is depicted . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the tip of this cone is the only region in momentum space where there is a finite thermal occupation of excited quasiparticles .",
    "thus , the specific heat can depend only on characteristic parameters associated with the dirac point .",

    "it corresponds to @xmath35 in the normal pseudogap case and does not change with the onset of superconductivity . in the nodal direction , the pseudogap @xmath100 and therefore @xmath101 which is the condition for the underlying large fermi surface .",

    "[ fig5](a ) for the bi@xmath2sr@xmath3la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 data of wen et al.@xcite and in ( b ) for the data on bi-2212 and ( y , ca)-123 of loram et al.@xcite where we have read slopes from the published figures as best as was possible .",
    "a more thorough analysis by the experimentalists might achieve better accuracy . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , we show our results for the fit to the @xmath8 dome of the wen et al.@xcite data .",
    "we find @xmath125t_0,\\ ] ] which provides a good representation of the @xmath8 data as a function of doping @xmath89 .",
    "we then take @xmath126 to place the data on our curves . in the main frame ,",
    "the solid black circles are the data for the slope at @xmath9 normalized to its value at optimum doping .",
    "the solid red line gives results of eq .",
    "( [ eq : slope ] ) with the assumption of @xmath127 .",
    "the agreement is very good and the sharp rise in slope in the overdoped region is captured by our model .",
    "for the deeply underdoped case , our theoretical values are somewhat higher than experiment , but as we have already mentioned , the gap ratio may well vary with doping . solving a bcs - like pairing equation with pseudogap formation and corresponding",
    "fermi surface reconstruction accounted for , schachinger and carbotte@xcite found that ( for @xmath128 ) approximately @xmath129.\\ ] ] if this correction , scaled to 6 at optimum , is incorporated into the comparison with experiment , we get the red dashed curve which agrees better with the data at small @xmath6 .",
    "note finally that to compare data with theory , we have shifted all @xmath6 values in fig .  [ fig5](a ) by 0.035 because we wished to remain , as in the paper of yrz@xcite , with optimum doping at @xmath38 rather than the experimental value of about 0.165 .",
    "this is also true for fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) where we compare with data on bi2212 ( triangles ) and ( y , ca)-123 ( squares ) .",
    "the agreement with theory ( solid and dashed red curves ) is again good .",
    "we have also included one further comparison with scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) results on bi2212 by pushp et al.@xcite ( circles ) .",
    "sts gives the dos and not the specific heat , but this latter quantity follows directly from a knowledge of @xmath59 .",
    "we can use the sts data in the limit of @xmath104 to determine @xmath59 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlow ] ) and so get @xmath97 for @xmath9 .",
    "these are the solid circles which provide a confirmation of the specific heat results and also provide a significant cross check between these two important but very different probes of the microscopic structure of the superconducting state in the underdoped cuprates and indeed over the entire phase diagram .",
    "the behavior of the specific heat of the underdoped cuprates differs profoundly from that observed on the overdoped side of their phase diagram . at optimum and overdoping , an ordinary bcs approach based on a fermi liquid normal state with constant dos",
    "provides a first reasonable understanding on the assumption that the gap has @xmath0-wave symmetry .",
    "this ensures a linear in @xmath1 low temperature law for the specific heat @xmath70 with @xmath130 .",
    "it also gives a jump at @xmath8 normalized to its normal state value of 0.95 and this value can be increased if the gap to @xmath8 ratio is changed from 4.3 to a higher value . on the deeply underdoped side ,",
    "however , there is new physics which can not be described even when strong coupling effects@xcite due to inelastic scattering@xcite are accounted for and/or effects of anisotropy@xcite . which go beyond a simple lowest harmonic @xmath0-wave picture for the superconducting gap .    in the resonating valence bond spin liquid picture , a second energy scale , the pseudogap , emerges and grows in magnitude as @xmath6 is reduced towards the mott insulating state .",
    "this pseudogap leads to a loss of metallicity .",
    "it also radically reduces the size of the specific heat jump at @xmath8 as noted in experiment@xcite and also in theory@xcite .",
    "however , as we show here the limit of @xmath9 of @xmath97 is not directly affected by the size of @xmath63 because this limiting value depends only on the band structure and superconducting gap right at the dirac point in the brillouin zone .",
    "but this point is not importantly changed by pseudogap formation and fermi surface reconstruction so that the formula for the slope @xmath131 as @xmath9 remains unchanged in form but with two important modifications .",
    "first , in the resonating valence bond spin liquid , there appears a gutzwiller factor @xmath14 which depends strongly on doping @xmath6 and represents the remaining weight in the coherent part of the electronic green s function as correlations become more important and consequently shift more spectral weight into an incoherent background at higher energies .",
    "a second factor is that the ratio of @xmath132 can vary with doping . for overdoped and",
    "optimally doped , in ordinary bcs @xmath0-wave it has a value of 4.3 , but schachinger and carbotte@xcite have found that it rises considerably in the underdoped region of the phase diagram .",
    "these authors solve a bcs gap equation generalized to include pseudogap formation and attendant fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "the results of such a theoretical study show that @xmath118 increases beyond a value of 7 before the lower end of the superconducting dome is reached .",
    "these two effects , along with the linear in @xmath1 law which we have shown to still hold in yrz theory at underdoping , allow us to understand a previously anomalous feature of the data namely the slope remains reasonably constant at underdoping while it increases sharply in the overdoped region .",
    "this last observation is consistent with a slope which varies inversely as the gap and this gap decreases toward zero as we approach the upper end of the dome .",
    "comparison between theory and data on bisrlacuo , bi2212 , and ( y , ca)-123 show good agreement .",
    "a further comparison was made with sts data which provides information on the average density of quasiparticle states .",
    "it was noticed by pushp et al.@xcite that the slope of this quantity , in the @xmath133 limit , while increasing with reduced value of @xmath8 at overdoping , saturates and perhaps even decreases slightly with decreasing @xmath6 in the highly underdoped regime .",
    "but the low @xmath95 dependence of the dos determines the low temperature behavior of the specific heat .",
    "for the specific case of bi2212 , we found good agreement between sts and specific heat data further confirming our work and providing a strong test of the consistency between experimental data obtained by these two very different techniques and their consistency with the resonating valence bond spin liquid .",
    "we have benefitted from discussions with james leblanc .",
    "this work has been supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) and by the canadian institute for advanced research ( cifar ) ."
