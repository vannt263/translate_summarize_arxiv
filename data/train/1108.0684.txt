    "a decade of running rhic , the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory on long island , has produced a plethora of intriguing experimental results that have challenged our understanding of hot and dense strongly interacting systems .",
    "one of these remarkable findings is that the matter produced at rhic appears to display striking flow characteristics that are consistent with expectations from ideal relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite . in spite of the fact that the era of heavy ion physics at the lhc has barely begun",
    ", it appears that those exciting features also are present at higher energies @xcite .",
    "the commonly accepted theoretical interpretation of this body of data is that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in the relativistic nuclear collisions performed at rhic and the lhc is `` strongly coupled '' : it displays aspects at odds with what perturbative qcd would predict .    strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) poses theoretically challenging yet experimentally accessible questions .",
    "the formation of qgp at rhic is an example where theoretical descriptions are completely lacking at low energies because our perturbative techniques fail at strong couplings .",
    "however probing the non - perturbative regime of large @xmath0 gauge theory through a _ gravity _ dual has led to some interesting results for the physics of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "a popular approach so far has been the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , even though qcd is not a conformal field theory .",
    "however , for certain gauge theories with running couplings , there exist gravity duals . at zero temperatures",
    "these gravity duals are studied in @xcite with , and in @xcite without , fundamental flavors . on the other hand , at high temperatures , there are examples of gravity duals with or without fundamental flavors in the literature @xcite , all of which are quite successful in analyzing various aspects of strongly coupled nuclear matter in the ir .",
    "but each of the models have their limitations , most prominently due to the absence of uv completions , and a supergravity description for strongly coupled qcd incorporating various phases of quark matter is yet to be discovered .",
    "while the low energy limit of klebanov - strassler model with fundamental matter ( which we call the ouyang - klebanov - strassler or the oks model ) gives the most promising candidate to study large @xmath0 strongly coupled qcd , the effective number of degrees of freedom grows indefinitely in the uv . in the presence of fundamental flavors such a proliferation of degrees of freedom lead to landau poles and uv divergences of the wilson loops .",
    "however , since this cascading theory provides an ideal setup to study phase transitions as one can describe various degrees of freedom in a single framework , controlling the uv behavior then becomes essential to describe a consistent theory that could describe physics at all energies . in @xcite",
    "such a uv completion was proposed and it is the goal of this paper to summarize and highlight some of the key features of this model and discuss its relevance to strongly coupled thermal qcd .",
    "our goal is to construct the dual gravity of thermal field theory resembling features of strongly coupled qcd . a gauge theory which becomes almost conformal in the uv with no landau poles or uv divergences of the wilson loops , but has logarithmic running of coupling in the ir , can be thought of as a suitable candidate mimicking qcd . following the developments in @xcite and @xcite , in @xcite it was proposed that such a gauge theory indeed has a dual gravity .",
    "in fact the original proposal in @xcite and @xcite was more along the _ reverse _ direction , namely , the ir geometry of @xcite was modified in steps in @xcite to construct a dual gauge theory that may have the required properties to be in the same class as large @xmath0 qcd . on the gauge theory side",
    "we need ir confining and uv conformal .",
    "so the question is what should we do to the gravity dual at large @xmath2 , i.e at large radial coordinate , to achieve the required properties ?",
    "the answer , as discussed in details in @xcite , is to first switch off the three - form fluxes at large @xmath2 so as to keep only five - form fluxes .",
    "this way ads type solutions could be constructed . secondly , to get rid of the landau poles , we need to control the axio - dilaton behavior so that they decay rapidly at large @xmath2 instead of having their usual growing logarithmic behavior .",
    "both these were achieved by switching on anti d5-branes and anti seven - branes with electric and magnetic fluxes on them to kill off the unnecessary tachyons and thereby restoring stability .",
    "additionally the anti seven - branes , alongwith the seven - branes , were embedded in a non - trivial way so as not to spoil the small @xmath2 , or the ir , behavior of the theory @xcite .",
    "the anti d5-branes are dissolved on the seven - branes , but they contribute to the three - form fluxes .",
    "together they control both the three form fluxes as well as the axio - dilaton at large @xmath2 .",
    "to be a bit more precise , the knowledge of the ns flux @xmath3 and dilaton @xmath4 uniquely determines the running of the gauge couplings . on the other hand",
    "the dual geometry is described by the modified conifold @xcite and it is sourced by three form flux @xmath5 , five form flux and @xmath6-d7 branes . in the uv , @xmath6-branes source three form",
    "fluxes that exactly cancel the three form fluxes _ originally _ sourced by the wrapped d5 branes @xcite . this way the effective three form fluxes vanish resulting in @xmath7 .",
    "then we can write @xmath8 at large @xmath2 and we get @xmath9 @xmath10 thus the dilaton uniquely determines the gauge coupling .",
    "if @xmath11 is the axio - dilation field , then using f - theory @xcite one can show that @xmath12 behaves like an inverse power series for large @xmath2 , i.e @xmath13 @xcite , provided we have controlled the logarithmic behavior by anti - brane embeddings discussed above . in a more mathematical language of f - theory ,",
    "@xmath12 is determined by finding the roots of the discriminant polynomial @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the complexified coordinate comprised of the two real coordinates of an internal @xmath16 .",
    "the roots give the precise location of the seven - branes and hence the dilaton is uniquely determined by the seven - brane embeddings . using the inverse power series behavior of @xmath12 , and identifying the energy scale with radial coordinate @xmath17 ,",
    "one gets for the gauge coupling @xmath8 the following behavior at the scale @xmath18 : g_ym~ which indicates that the field theory reaches conformal fixed point at the highest energies .",
    "motivated by the above construction in @xcite , the question now would be how to study the gauge theory , or the brane side of the story .",
    "the ir physics is captured by the near horizon geometry of d3 branes at the conifold point with additional wrapped d5-branes .",
    "thus in this picture one needs to add the seven - branes as well as the anti - branes in addition to modifying the geometry . as we know ,",
    "any brane configurations that are _ away _ from the original klebanov - strassler configuration , i.e not coinciding with the d3 and wrapped d5-branes , would survive on the dual gravity side as branes ( and not convert to pure geometry and fluxes ) . on the other hand , the modifications that we did on the gravity side to get to the required gauge theory may be too difficult to simulate using simple arrangements of branes .",
    "however we can still incorporate many of the informations on the gravity side to the brane side of the story , that could at least give us a hint of the required gauge theory .",
    "thus a possible proposal would be that the following configuration of d3-d7-d5-branes ( including the required anti - branes plus world - volume fluxes ) would give rise to our desired gauge theory , albeit in the large @xmath0 limit with matter in fundamental representation :    , where @xmath19 is minkowski space and @xmath20 is a six dimensional cone .",
    "the actual configuration is non - trivial to depict pictorially and may not even exist as a simple arrangement of branes .",
    "the gravity dual , on the other hand , is more robust and can be easily described as shown in @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    place @xmath0 d3 branes at the tip of a six dimensional conifold with radial coordinate @xmath2 and base @xmath21 .",
    "the world volume of the d3 branes extend in four minkowski directions .",
    "now place @xmath22 number of d5 branes which wrap the @xmath23 on the conifold base and extend in four minkowski directions and place another @xmath22 number of anti d5 branes away from but parallel to the d5 branes .",
    "the d5-@xmath6 branes are separated along the radial @xmath2 direction .",
    "furthermore place @xmath24 number of d7 branes extending in the radial @xmath2 direction , wrapping the base @xmath25 and filling up four minkowski directions .",
    "the brane - anti brane configurations will result in tachyonic modes but introducing fluxes sourced by the branes can stabilize the system .",
    "details of the embedding can be found in @xcite , @xcite and one can , with the risk of oversimplification and possible pitfalls , depict the brane configuration as in fig . 1 .",
    "the excitations of these d3-d5-d7 branes ( and the required anti - branes ) are described by a gauge theory which in the uv has @xmath26 color symmetry group and @xmath27 flavor symmetry group @xcite from the seven - branes .",
    "this is because addition of ( @xmath28 ) branes at the junction , or more appropriately anti five - branes at the junction with gauge fluxes on its world - volume , tell us that the number of three - branes degrees of freedom are @xmath29 , with the @xmath22 factor coming from five - branes anti - five - branes pairs .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath30 gauge theory will tell us that the gravity dual is approximately ads , but has rg flows because of the fundamental flavors . at the scale @xmath31",
    "we expect one of the gauge group to be higgsed , so that we are left with @xmath32 .",
    "now both the gauge fields flow at different rates and give rise to the cascade that is slowed down by the @xmath24 flavors . in the end , at far ir , we expect confinement at zero temperature .",
    "if @xmath33 are the two gauge couplings , they are related to the dilaton @xmath4 and the two form ns - ns flux @xmath3 by following duality relations that capture the essence of gauge / gravity duality here : [ coupling1 ] + & = & + e^&=&b_2 a little bit of elaboration may elucidate the story further . as the anti five branes are placed at some radial location @xmath34 , their excitations give massive modes with energy scale @xmath35 . at low energies , @xmath36 , these modes are not excited and hence can be ignored .",
    "this means at low energies , the effect of the anti five branes @xmath6 will not be important and we effectively have ouyang - klebanov - strassler geometry of @xcite with a black - hole , which is region 1 of @xcite .",
    "thus in the ir we will have the @xmath37 color symmetry group and @xmath27 flavor symmetry group with gauge couplings @xmath33 running logarithmically as @xmath38 .",
    "more precisely , using the exact form of fluxes and the dilaton at small @xmath2 , i.e at low energies , we get the following beta functions : [ beta_1 ] & = & - + & = & 3m(1 +  log ) at the ir , we see that the two gauge couplings run in opposite directions and @xmath39 flows to strong coupling . performing a seiberg duality transformation ,",
    "we identify the strongly coupled @xmath39 with a weakly coupled @xmath40 at the ir .",
    "we see that not only the number of colors are reduced , but the difference of the size of the gauge group now decreases from @xmath22 in @xcite to @xmath41 .",
    "this difference will decrease by the increments of @xmath24 until it is smaller than or equal to @xmath24 .",
    "then there are two possible end points :    .1 in    @xmath42 if @xmath0 is still greater than zero then we will have an approximately conformal theory in the far ir , or    .1 in    @xmath42 if @xmath0 decreases to zero but with finite @xmath22 left over then we will have a @xmath43 theory with @xmath24 flavors that confines in the far ir ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    ".1 in    the latter theory , or more particularly the high temperature limit of the latter theory , is what we are interested in and henceforth we will only consider that theory . once we know the dual background we can say that the hilbert space of the gauge theory can be obtained from the hilbert space of the string theory on this geometry .",
    "the dual geometry of above brane theory in the decoupling regime was proposed in @xcite .",
    "one basically minimizes sugra action with the fluxes running logarithmically with @xmath2 for small @xmath2 and as inverse of @xmath2 for large @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting metric in the non extremal limit is [ metric1 ] ds^2&=&-dt^2 + dr^2 + d^2 + r^2_mndx^m dx^n + & & g _ dx^dx^+r^2_mndx^m dx^n = g_dx^dx^where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the internal five - dimensional metric is denoted by @xmath47 whereas the other five - dimensional space is denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "we have also defined the following : [ metric2 ] h h(r,,_1,_2,_1,_2)&= &   for   large  r + & = &   for   small  rfor the warp factor @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is taken to be functions of all the internal as well as the radial coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "this should be compared to earlier work of @xcite where the warp factor is only a function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the rest of the variables are now defined as : h h(r,,_1,_2,_1,_2 ) & = & _ i=0   for   large  r + & = & _ j , k=0   for   small  rwith @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the black - hole horizon and @xmath52 are determined by the location of the d7 branes , the fluxes and the horizon . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the non extremal solution has a regular schwarzchild horizon that covers the ir singularity of the extremal metric but the internal space gets modified .",
    "this modification of the internal space is described by the metric @xmath47 which is not the metric of @xmath25 but accounts for the deformation of the internal space .",
    "the forms of @xmath52 and @xmath47 are given in @xcite for the extremal case and the extremal solution of the ir geometry is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the non extremal solution for the brane configuration in fig 1 is under preparation @xcite .",
    "however , the study of confinement mechanism and the computation of diffusion and drag coefficient will only require the knowledge of the warp factors at the location of the string which we will choose to be fixed in the internal directions .",
    "this means @xmath53 will be constant along the string and we will treat @xmath52 as only functions of horizon radius @xmath51 .    to compute the stress tensor",
    ", we do need to know the exact form of @xmath52 as a function of internal coordinates .",
    "however , to obtain information about the four dimensional field theory , we will first integrate over the internal directions and after the integrations , we will be left with a five dimensional metric @xmath54 of the form given in ( [ metric1 ] ) with warp factors @xmath55 now only being functions of @xmath2 .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath56 of the five dimensional warp factors would only depend on @xmath51 .",
    "the question now is how does the warp factor @xmath49 depend on the black - hole horizon @xmath51 ?",
    "of course the einstein equations along with the flux equations will dictate this dependence- but one can restrict the form of the warp factor as a function of @xmath51 by analyzing the dual gauge theory .",
    "in particular , the warp factor is related to the size of the dual gauge group @xcite@xcite , [ neff1 ] & & g_s n_eff =r^4h = l^4(1+_i=1 ) + & & n_eff = n(1+_i=1 ) at large @xmath2 . now from the t - dual description of the brane configuration in fig 1 @xcite , one concludes that @xmath57 keeps on growing with energy scale @xmath18 i.e. the radial coordinate @xmath2 on the dual gravity side , which is depicted by fig 2 . from [ neff1 ]",
    "we see that this means [ cond11 ] _ k k a_k r^k-1   <   0 for large @xmath2 . but",
    "@xmath58 s are functions of @xmath51 , thus ( [ cond11 ] ) can be used to restrict the form @xmath58 s as functions of @xmath51 .",
    "for example one way is that all @xmath59 for all @xmath51 so that this will automatically satisfy ( [ cond11 ] ) .    on the other hand for small @xmath2",
    ", one possibility is that the ir geometry is completely hidden behind the black - hole horizon , which will be the case for high temperatures @xcite .",
    "then we are left with the geometry at large @xmath2 .",
    "however for low temperature and small @xmath2 , we have [ neff ] & & g_s n_eff =r^4h = l^4 + & & n_eff = nagain from the gauge theory interpretation that @xmath57 grows with @xmath2 , we get [ cond2 ] _ j , k   <   0 as long as ( [ cond11 ] ) is satisfied at large @xmath2 and ( [ cond2 ] ) is satisfied at small @xmath2 , we have a consistent supergravity description for thermal cascading gauge theory which flows according to fig 2 .",
    "in order to compute expectation values of certain observables of the gauge theory , one first computes the partition function .",
    "as the hilbert space of the quantum field theory arising from brane excitations in fig 1 is contained in the hilbert space of the geometry sourced by these branes , there should be a one - to - one correspondence between the partition functions of the gauge theory and the dual gravity .",
    "a precise mapping for the conformal case was proposed by witten @xcite who stated that the partition function of the strongly coupled quantum field theory should be identified with the partition function of the weakly coupled classical gravity .",
    "in particular if we are interested in computing the expectation value of an operator @xmath61 with a source @xmath62 , one can make the following identification of the partition function as a functional of the source @xmath62 : [ ks16 ] z_gauge[_0 ] &  &   _ m^4 _ 0 o  =   z_gravity[_0 ] + &   &  exp(s_sugra[_0 ] + s_gh[_0 ] + s_counterterm[_0 ] ) where @xmath63 is a minkowski manifold , @xmath64 is the gibbons - hawking boundary term @xcite , @xmath62 should be understood as a fluctuation over a given configuration of field and @xmath65 is the counter - term action added to renormalize the action .",
    "we will briefly describe how each term is obtained from supergravity action and their necessity .",
    "first observe that @xmath4 is a bulk field , which is in general a function of the coordinates of the geometry and @xmath62 is the boundary value of @xmath4 .",
    "one integrates the classical ten dimensional gravity action over the compact manifold @xmath66 to obtain an effective action @xmath67 for a five dimensional manifold .",
    "the bulk five dimensional geometry has a boundary at @xmath68 and the boundary describes a four dimensional manifold with an induced minkowski flat metric .",
    "thus the boundary value of @xmath4 _ 0(t , x , y , z)(r=,t , x , y , z ) is a field which lives in four dimensional flat space and plays the role of source in the four dimensional gauge theory .    now to obtain the gravity action as a functional of @xmath62 , one integrates the five dimensional effective action @xmath69 over the radial coordinate @xmath2 and we are left with gravity action @xmath70 $ ] as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "it turns out that in general for the gravity action @xmath71 $ ] to be stationary under perturbation @xmath72 , one needs to add surface terms @xmath73 $ ] which are known as the gibbons - hawking terms @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "after the radial integral is done , for some sources @xmath4 , @xmath70 $ ] becomes infinite and one needs to regularize the action to obtain finite expectation values for operators .",
    "the regularization requires addition of extra terms which cancel the infinities that appear in the gravity action and are denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "keeping all this in mind , one takes the functional derivative of ( [ ks16 ] ) with respect to @xmath62 to obtain [ o ] & = & = + & ~ &  exp(s_total[_0 ] )  _ _ 0=0 where we depict @xmath74 $ ] as : @xmath74=s[\\phi_0 ] + s_{\\rm gh}[\\phi_0 ] + s_{\\rm counterterm}[\\phi_0]$ ] .",
    "note that , from our construction , this is also the renormalized action .",
    "observe that in the usual ads / cft case we consider the action at the boundary to map it directly to the dual gauge theory side .",
    "for general gauge / gravity dualities , there are many possibilities of defining different gauge theories at the boundary depending on how we cut - off the geometry and add uv caps .",
    "the details on adding geometries at large @xmath2 to existing ir geometries for small @xmath2 can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the important thermodynamical quantity to extract from our background would be the stress tensor .",
    "as the stress tensor couples to the metric , its expectation value is obtained from the renormalized action @xmath75 via @xmath76}{\\delta l_{ij}}\\big{|}_{l_{ij}=0}$ ] where we have chosen @xmath77 as the four dimensional effective metric induced by the ten dimensional metric of the form ( [ metric1 ] ) ( see @xcite for details on the procedure ) . at every fixed @xmath2 the five dimensional",
    "metric induces a four dimensional metric and with appropriate rescaling of the time coordinate , we can view this effective four dimensional metric as a flat minkowski metric ( with possible perturbations ) .",
    "if @xmath78 denote the perturbations on the background by quark strings that stretch from the d7 branes to the horizon of the black hole , then writing the supergravity action up to quadratic order in @xmath78 ; using integration by parts together with appropriate gibbons - hawking terms ; and holographically renormalizing the subsequent action , we obtain : [ wakeup ] & & t^mm_medium + quark = _ , \\{(h_^mn+ h_^nm)s_nn^(4 ) [ ] -4(k_^mn+ k_^nm)s_nn^(4 ) [ ] + & &   + ( k_^mn+ k_^nm)s_nn^(5 ) [ ] + _",

    "( 3.107 ) of @xcite , the energy - momentum tensor will not appear diagonal .",
    "we simply found it convenient in @xcite to express the energy - momentum tensor using the @xmath80 variables .",
    "these subtleties are described in full details in @xcite . ] .",
    "the quantities @xmath82 etc . with @xmath83",
    "are given in @xcite and are completely independent of the radial coordinate @xmath2 and depend on the 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime coordinates .",
    "note also that the stress tensor depends only on the temperature @xmath1 and is independent of any cut - offs .",
    "the dependence on the uv degrees of freedom is exponentially suppressed , and in the limit @xmath84 we reproduce the result for the parent cascading theory .",
    "this exponential suppression comes from the form of @xmath85 where @xmath49 is the warp factor . for geometries such that @xmath86 at large @xmath2 , one easily gets that @xmath87 where we have taken @xmath88 limit and defined @xmath89 .",
    "sending @xmath88 also means @xmath90 , thus the final result for the stress tensor will be same for various uv completions .",
    "however , the point we are trying to make is that different uv completions reach the same ir limit .    for asymptotic ads spaces",

    "more precisely , for a generic asymptotic ads uv completion , there might not be any analytic inverse functions @xmath96 such that @xmath97 .",
    "hence it might not be possible to see how @xmath98 reaches zero .",
    "but the final result is independent of how this limit is reached and is only sensitive to @xmath92 , thus ( [ wakeup1 ] ) uniquely determines the field theory stress tensor .    with the general formulation of stress tensor ( [ wakeup]),([wakeup1 ] ) ,",
    "which is similar to the ads / cft results @xcite in the limiting case @xmath99 , we can compute the wake a moving quark creates in a plasma with @xmath78 being the metric perturbation due to string ( see @xcite for an equivalent ads calculation ) .",
    "furthermore we can compute the shear viscosity @xmath100 from the kubo formula with the propagator obtained from the dual partition function ( [ ks16 ] ) and the entropy density @xmath101 obtained by computing energy and pressure density using the stress tensors ( [ wakeup ] ) , ( [ wakeup1 ] ) .",
    "alternatively entropy @xmath101 can be identified with the black hole entropy using wald s formula and the result for the ratio @xmath60 is given by : [ final1 ] & = &   1 + _ k = 1^_k e^-4k n_uv 4 + 1  log^2 ( 1 - t^4 e^-4n_uv ) + & - &   <",
    "14where ( @xmath102 ) are constants that depend on the temperature @xmath1 and @xmath103 ; and @xmath104 is the coefficient of the riemann square term coming from the back reactions of the d7 branes in the background .",

    "this restricts the form of the terms that appears from d7 brane back reaction as we require the boundary gauge theory to be causal .",

    "the gravity waves associated with the collisions evolve with time and from the induced boundary metric , one can compute the energy momentum tensor of the field theory . analyzing the time dependence of this stress tensor , one can learn about the evolution of the medium and subsequently account for the effects it has on the quark dynamics .",
    "we have computed the fluxes and the form of the warp factor for our static dual geometry , but did not give explicit expressions for the deformation of the internal five dimensional metric to all order in @xmath270 .",
    "however , we have explicitly shown the einstein equations that determine the form of the internal metric and using our ansatz in @xcite , one can in principle compute coefficients in the expansion of the internal metric to all orders in @xmath271 . even without a precise knowledge of the internal geometry , we were able to extract crucial information about the dual gauge theory and formulated how the higher order corrections may enter into our analysis .",
    "most of the calculation only relied on the warp factor and with the knowledge of its precise form , we were able to calculate thermal mass , drag and diffusion coefficients , @xmath60 and finally free energy of @xmath177 pair .",
    "for completeness of the supergravity analysis , we hope to compute the exact solution for the internal metric using the ansatz of @xcite in our future work .    in our computation of the heavy quark potential , we classified the most general dual gravity that allows linear confinement of quarks at large separation and small temperatures .",
    "we showed that if a gauge theory has dual gravity description and its effective degrees of freedom grows monotonically in the uv , it always shows linear confinement at large distances , as long as the dual warp factor satisfies a very simple relation given by ( [ eq : finitetopt ] ) .",
    "thus ( [ eq : finitetopt ] ) can be regarded as a sufficient condition for linear confinement of gauge theories with dual gravity .",
    "it would be interesting to study what are the general brane configurations that allow warp factors which satisfy ( [ eq : finitetopt ] ) and thus give rise to confining gauge theories .",
    "we leave it as a future direction to be explored .",
    "as the dual geometry incorporates features of seiberg duality cascade , our construction is ideal for studying phase transitions .",
    "the gauge theories we studied have description in terms of gauge groups of lower and lower ranks . from the gravity dual analysis , by cutting the geometry at certain radial location and attaching another geometry up to infinity , we can construct gravity description for various phases of a gauge theory",
    ". each phase will have different dual geometries attached in the large @xmath2 region while the small @xmath2 region will be common to all the theories .",
    "a flow from large @xmath2 to small @xmath2 geometry can be interpreted as ` flow ' from an effective theory in the uv to another in the ir . from uv to ir , the different effective theories will describe different phases of the gauge theory and this can allow one to study the various phases of dense matter .",
    "thus our construction is not only useful to analyze strongly coupled gauge theory , but also has potential for studying phase transitions in ultra dense medium and we hope to address this issue in the future .",
