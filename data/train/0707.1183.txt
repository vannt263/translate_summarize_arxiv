    "recent observational evidences of anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation [ 1 ] and the data from type ia supernovae sn 1997h redshift [ 2 - 4 ] suggest that the universe is flat and is undergoing at present an accelerating phase preceeded by a period of deceleration .",
    "these observational facts can not be explained by the known ordinary ( baryonic ) matter or radiation .",
    "there should be a significant amount of energy density of the universe which should be an extraordinary non - baryonic matter ( dark matter ) and energy ( dark energy ) .",
    "also , observational facts indicate that , dark matter should be of the order of 25% of the critical density and dark energy contributes about @xmath2 of the the critical density [ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "further , the universe in very recent past ( at redshift @xmath3 ) , is dominated by uniformly distributed dark energy with negative pressure and is probably responsible for the present phase of acceleration of the universe . in last few years , several models",
    "have been suggested to incorporate the recent observational evidences and among them , a single component perfect fluid having exotic equation of state , known as chaplygin gas [ 8 - 18 ] is of great interest .",
    "a further generalized form is known as modified chaplygin gas [ the equation of state is given in section iii , equation ( 12 ) ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are universal positive constants .",
    "the special choice @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponds to chaplygin gas , first introduced to describe lifting forces on a plane wing in aerodynamics process [ 12 ] .",
    "its generalization with the choice @xmath7 , @xmath9 is known as generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) , first introduced by kamenshchik et al.[13 ] and bento et al.[14 ] . for small energy density",
    ", the gcg model will have negative pressure while at high energy density , the model behaves as an almost pressureless fluid . however , mcg model , an extension of gcg model [ 8 ,  15 ] , can interpolate states between standard fluids at high density and constant negative pressure at low energy .",
    "in fact , the mcg model for @xmath10 describes the evolution from radiation epoch at early time to @xmath0cdm era at late time ( where the fluid has constant energy density and behaves as a cosmological constant ) .",
    "this causes the present accelerating phase of the universe [ 8 ,  9 ,  15 ] .",
    "another point that also goes against the gcg model is the measurement of the velocity of sound . in gcg model ,",
    "the velocity of sound is negligible at early times and approaches the speed of light at late times .",
    "but in cosmic evolution , sound velocity comparable to the light velocity is not compatible .",
    "+ from phenomenological view point , mcg model is interesting and can be motivated by the brane world interpretation [ 14 ] .",
    "further , this model is consistent with various classes of cosmological tests viz .",
    "gravitational lensing [ 17 ] , gamma - ray bursts [ 18 ] as well as the above mentioned observations . moreover , the present mcg model ( also gcg model ) is naturally constrained through cosmological observables [ 16 ] . also , for low energy density",
    ", the present model has similarity with gcg model and so the equation of state is that of a polytropic gas [ 15 ] with negative index .",
    "therefore , it is possible to have astrophysical implications of the present model with an alternative way of restricting the parameters [ 16 ] . + as in mcg model , though the pressure is initially positive , but with the evolution of the universe , the pressure becomes negative and finally behaves as phantom energy .",
    "it is well known that phantom energy violates null energy condition , a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes [ 19 ,  20 ] .",
    "this purely theoretical ingredient possesses a peculiar property viz .",
    "`` exotic matter '' , whose stress - energy tensor violates the null energy condition .",
    "this common fact of violation of null energy condition motivates to study wormholes supported by mcg equation of state . in this work",
    ", we shall construct static and spherically symmetric traversable wormhole geometries , satisfying the mcg equation of state .",
    "we shall consider matching of these wormhole geometries to an exterior vacuum space time and examine physical properties and characteristics of these solutions .",
    "we shall also study the traversability conditions [ 19 ,  21 ] and measure the amount of averaged null energy condition violating matter [ 22 ,  23 ] in particular cases .",
    "+ the remainder of our paper is organized as follows : section ii provides basic equations for wormhole geometry . in section iii",
    ", we have formulated the fundamental equations describing wormhole in modified chaplygin gas and the restrictions on the parameters of the equation of state of mcg have been presented .",
    "section iv deals with asymptotic flatness of the wormhole geometry .",
    "the non - flat ( aymptotically ) wormhole solutions are bounded by an exterior vacuum space time for which , details of surface stresses are shown . in section",
    "v , some specific wormhole solutions are derived and their physical properties and characteristics are explored . we have considered the choices viz .",
    "( i ) a particular relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( in differential form ) , ( ii ) constant redshift function , ( iii ) two typical choices of the shape function and lastly ( iv ) isotropic pressure with a typical form of @xmath13 .",
    "the traversability condition has been studied in details for constant redshift function with a toy example . also for the linear form of @xmath13 , the amount of averaged null energy condition violating matter has been estimated using `` volume integral quantifier '' .",
    "finally , the paper ends with discussion and concluding remarks in section vi .",
    "a spherically symmetric and static wormhole is given in schwarzschild coordinates by the space time metric    @xmath14~dt^{2}+\\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\\frac{b(r)}{r } } + r^{2}d\\omega^{2}\\ ] ]    where the two arbitrary functions of @xmath15 viz .",

    "the radial coordinate @xmath15 ranges over @xmath17 where the minimum value @xmath18 corresponds to the radius of the throat of the wormhole .",
    "but there may be a cut - off of the stress - energy tensor at any finite junction radius @xmath19 , where the interior space time matches to an exterior vacuum solution .",
    "+ the following properties need to be imposed for the existence of a wormhole solution : [ 19 ,  20 ]    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    iii .",
    "@xmath23    ( regularity of the metric coefficient ) + iv .",
    "traversability criteria : for traversable wormhole , there should not be any horizons present i.e , @xmath11 must be finite everywhere .",
    "+ using the einstein field equation @xmath24 , in an orthonormal reference frame ( @xmath25 ) , we obtain the following set of equations    @xmath26    @xmath27\\ ] ]    and    @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath29    in which @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the energy density , radial pressure and tangential pressure respectively .",
    "the energy conservation equation gives    @xmath33    this equation can be interpreted as the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for the material threading the wormhole .",
    "+ the above einstein equations can be rearranged to obtain metric coefficients in terms of the components of the stress - energy tensors as    @xmath34    @xmath35    the above flaring out condition implies that the wormhole should be threaded with matter violating the null energy condition ( nec ) ( a fundamental property of wormholes ) . matter that violates the nec",
    "is termed as exotic matter [ 19 ,  24 ,  25 ] .",
    "the mathematical form of the null energy condition is @xmath36 for any null vector @xmath37 .",
    "however , in an orthonormal reference frame , we may choose @xmath38 so that the violation of nec simplifies to @xmath39 i.e ,    @xmath40<0\\ ] ]    note that , if we evaluate at the throat considering the flaring out condition and the finite character of @xmath16 , the above inequality ( 11 ) is automatically satisfied , i.e , the null energy condition is violated .",
    "the mcg is described by the equation of state [ 8 ,  9 ]    @xmath41    where the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two universal positive constants .",
    "this equation of state shows a radiation era ( when @xmath42 ) at one extreme ( when the matter density @xmath1 is very large ) and a @xmath0cdm model at the other extreme ( when @xmath1 is infinitesimally small ) .",
    "however , at all stages it shows a mixture .",
    "further , somewhere in between the two extreme , there is one stage when the pressure vanishes and the matter content is equivalent to pure dust ( this cosmological model can be considered from the field theoretical point of view by introducing a scalar field having self - interacting potential [ 9 ] ) .",
    "+ now eliminating @xmath1 and @xmath43 among the equations ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) , we have the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( in differential form ) as    @xmath44}{2r^{2}\\left(1-\\frac{b}{r}\\right)}\\ ] ]    any solution of the metric ( 1 ) satisfying relation ( 13 ) is termed as modified chaplygin wormhole provided it obeys the restrictions ( mentioned in the previous section ) for wormholes . in principle , we now have four equations ( 8)-(10 ) , ( 13 ) containing five unknowns viz . two metric coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath13 and three physical quantities ( components of stress - energy tensor ) @xmath1 , @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "so we may restrict one of the above unknown quantity ( or a relation among them ) for a specific solution . in the present problem , we shall choose @xmath13 or @xmath16 so that the solution fulfills the criteria of wormholes .",

    "so if @xmath54 is chosen to be positive , then @xmath55 i.e , dominant energy condition is satisfied .",
    "but for the choice of negative values of @xmath54 , the restriction ( 16 ) is automatically satisfied , a fundamental ingredient in wormhole physics .",
    "moreover , the expression for the velocity of sound is    @xmath56    the condition that @xmath57 should not exceed the velocity of light demands    @xmath58    thus combining ( 16 ) and ( 19 ) we have the constraint    @xmath59    it should be mentioned that in the domain of exotic matter , @xmath60 may not be interpreted as the speed of sound due to the lack of knowledge of a microphysical model of exotic matter . on the other hand , there are examples of exotic behaviour such as casimir effect and the false vacuum [ 26 ] where @xmath61 .",
    "in the above , the basic structure of the solution has been shown and the restrictions for the parameters involved are presented . a solution for which @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 , corresponds to asymptotically flat space times .",
    "however , every solution may not be related to asymptotically flat space time . then the stress - energy may be cut - off at a finite radial coordinate @xmath19 and the interior solution of metric ( 1 ) is matched to an exterior vacuum space time at the junction interface @xmath65 .",
    "the junction @xmath65 may be a thin shell ( if there are surface stresses at the junction surface ) or simply a boundary surface ( zero surface stresses ) .",
    "hence for solutions corresponding to asymptotically non - flat geometry , the mcg distribution is restricted to the neighbourhood of the throat of the corresponding wormhole solution .",

    "so the mcg is confined in a neighbourhood of the throat and the above solution can be matched to exterior vacuum geometry ( as described in section iv ) .",
