    "extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) are stars which fail to reach the thermally pulsing stage on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) after evolving off the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) . after core helium exhaustion ,",
    "ehb stars evolve into either post - early agb ( p - eagb ) stars which leave the agb before thermal pulsing or  stars , which never reach the agb ( brocato ,  1990 ; greggio & renzini 1990 [ gr90 ] ; dorman , rood , & oconnell 1993 [ dro93 ] ) .",
    "these stars have undergone such extreme mass loss during their first ascent up the giant branch that only a very thin hydrogen envelope survives .",
    "stars identified as ehb stars are found in low metallicity globular clusters as an extension of the normal hb ",
    "perhaps most prominently in ( whitney  1994 ) and ( buonanno  1986 ; castellani , degliinnocenti , & pulone 1995 ) . in higher metallicity populations ,",
    "ehb stars are found in the the metal rich cluster ( liebert , saffer , & green 1994 ) and as field sdb stars ( saffer & liebert 1995 ; dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 [ dor95 ] ) .",
    "ehb stars and their  and p - eagb progeny are perhaps the prime candidate objects for the far - ultraviolet upturn ( uvx ) observed in elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges ( burstein  1988 ; gr90 ; ferguson & davidsen 1993 ; dor95 ) .",
    "one difficulty in understanding the ehb stars is that at a given composition the range of total stellar mass which produces ehb behavior is very narrow .",
    "superficially , it appears that mass loss must be `` fine tuned '' such that the red giants lose a large amount of mass , but stop just short of losing the entire envelope . for globular clusters",
    "where the blue hb is populated ( the intermediate blue hb ( ibhb ) in the nomenclature of dor95 ) it is easy to imagine that some ehb stars result from the high mass loss tail of the mass loss distribution . at high metallicity as in  ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) there appear to be ehb stars even though the ibhb is not populated ",
    "liebert  ( 1994 ) were unable to explain with a `` normal '' hb mass distribution .",
    "also , the sdb stars of the galactic field form a separate evolutionary group from the field blue hb stars ( heber 1986 ) and make up a considerable proportion of all uv - excess objects ( green , schmidt , & liebert 1986 ) . since the ehb appears to occur over a wide range of metallicity , not only might the mass loss require `` tuning , '' but that tuning might require substantial adjustment with metallicity . understanding how ehb stars could be produced for a wide range of compositions , without fine tuning ,",
    "was the initial motivation for this investigation .",
    "the effects of mass loss have been studied extensively in the different phases of stellar evolution ( see dupree 1986 for a review ) .",
    "if the sun is to be taken as an example , low mass main sequence ( ms ) stars experience negligible mass loss , @xmath5 .",
    "if the rate of mass loss is constant over the main sequence lifetime of a star then it loses on the order of @xmath6 in about 10gyr .",
    "however , the mass loss rate is expected to increase as stellar luminosity increases and surface gravity decreases along the giant branch .",
    "both observations and empirical scaling laws such as the reimers relation ( reimers 1975 , 1977 ) suggest that a substantial fraction of a star s mass could be lost on the giant branch ( dupree 1986 ) .",
    "since mass loss is a surface phenomenon , it only affects the convective envelope of the rgb stars , and except in extreme cases , evolution of the interior of the star continues without any knowledge of the loss of the mass from the surface ( see also @xcite and @xcite [ cc93 ] ) .",
    "because of this , mass loss has ordinarily been neglected during red giant evolution , with the total mass lost during this phase being removed at the helium flash for the purposes of modeling later evolution .",
    "however , with extreme , but plausible mass loss rates , a star can lose so much mass that its total mass becomes comparable to its core mass .",
    "the basic behavior of such stars is obvious ( renzini 1981 ; caputo  1981 ) . at some point",
    "the envelope mass becomes so small that a large convective envelope can no longer exist .",
    "then , instead of continuing to the tip of the giant branch , the star `` peels - off '' the giant branch and evolves towards higher temperatures at almost constant luminosity .",
    "we call this an rgb peel - off star",
    ".    there are two possible routes of evolution for peel - off stars .",
    "the more obvious resembles the evolution of post - agb models ( schnberner 1979 , 1983 ) but with the peel - off stars dying quietly as he white dwarfs ( he wds ) .",
    "we refer to these as `` '' stars ( rgb - stragglers in the nomenclature of @xcite and castellani , luridiana , & romaniello 1994 ) .",
    "initially , it was assumed that this was the only route followed by peel - off stars .",
    "hence , it was also assumed that the smallest envelope mass that actually reaches the he - flash on the rgb , i.e.  the envelope mass at peel - off , set the minimum envelope mass  and thus the maximum effective temperature  for hb stars at the onset of he burning . eventually cc93 found another evolutionary path for peel - off stars .",
    "despite the fact that the stars were cooling along the he - white - dwarf cooling curve , for some range of parameters a he core flash occurred . even though the h - burning shell was extinguished , the outer parts of he core were compressible enough that contraction continued , leading eventually to helium ignition .",
    "we call these stars `` hot he - flashers '' to distinguish them from the classic rgb tip flashers .",
    "hot - flashers spend their entire he burning life at high , first as extreme hb stars , and then as  stars ( cc93 ; castellani  1995 ) .",
    "cc93 discovered hot - flashers in a study which incorporated mass loss along the giant branch via the reimers formula ( reimers 1977 ) . from cc93 as well as @xcite and @xcite , it was not clear whether hot - flash behavior could be achieved without fine tuning the reimers mass loss efficiency .",
    "our initial goal was to determine the range of  leading to the high - temperature flashes as a function of metallicity . anticipating that fine tuning would be required",
    ", we would then explore other mass loss formalisms which would more easily lead to the production of ehb stars . as it turned out , fine tuning of  was not necessary .",
    "we expect that the hot - flash phenomenon should occur for a fairly broad class of mass loss laws for almost any composition .",
    "we have computed rgb models with mass loss over a wide range of metallicities .",
    "the calculations of our models , including our treatment of mass loss are described in   [ sec : cal ] .",
    "we present the results of our rgb models and their corresponding hb models in   [ subsec : rgbevol ] and   [ subsec : hb ] respectively .",
    "the astrophysical significance of our results and the occurrence of ehb stars in stellar populations with different metallicities is discussed in   [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we have computed evolutionary tracks from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , using a modified version of the stellar evolution code stev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the details of the code can be found in dorman ( 1992a ) and vandenberg ( 1983 , 1992 ) .",
    "mass loss has been incorporated into the code for stars with convective envelopes  the mass of the convective envelope is reduced by an amount given by a specified mass - loss - law at each timestep .",
    "a new internal mass mesh grid is created for each model because of the reduced surface mass . upon convergence of the stellar structure equations , a valid stellar model of reduced mass",
    "is obtained .",
    "we neglect mass loss along the main sequence . for our evolutionary tracks",
    "we assume that mass loss takes place only during the red giant branch phase .",
    "the mass loss prescription that we use here is the widely used reimers formula ( reimers 1975 , 1977 ) :    @xmath7    where @xmath3 is a mass loss efficiency parameter , @xmath8 is the luminosity , @xmath9 is the surface gravity , and @xmath10 is the radius , with @xmath11 in solar units . to produce a `` normal '' globular cluster horizontal branch requires @xmath3 @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the mass loss rate is large enough , the star leaves the rgb before reaching the tip .",
    "it evolves toward higher temperatures at constant luminosity after rgb peel - off .",
    "this results in a decrease in radius and an increase in surface gravity , which should cause the mass loss rate to decrease . for hot stars",
    ", different mass loss mechanisms may be important ( chiosi & maeder 1986 ) , but the mass loss rates are expected to be significantly smaller in the tightly bound remnants of low mass stars than in young massive stars in which high temperature winds have been observed and modeled . in anticipation of this physically expected decrease in mass loss rate , we turn off the mass loss after the convective envelope contains less than @xmath13 .    the code stev calculates stellar models using the eggleton non - lagrangian scheme ( @xcite ) for the conventional red giant branch evolution ( @xcite ) , and a standard lagrangian grid for all other evolutionary phases .",
    "the non - lagrangian scheme was designed primarily for the evolution of stars with a thin burning shell , as an alternative to the shell - shifting technique ( see sweigart & gross 1978 ) .",
    "it provides a faster means of computing the evolution when there is a rapidly advancing shell , since it does not require that the timestep be small enough to ensure that only a small mass fraction of the burning shell is consumed between models .",
    "typical rgb calculations require about 600 models , a third of which are used to compute small timesteps close to the he - flash .",
    "however , since our implementation of the eggleton scheme provides only limited capability for following a detailed nuclear reaction network ( but see han , podsiadlowski , & eggleton 1995 ) , the calculations are halted after the star leaves the rgb , and continued with the lagrangian code , which follows 7 elements in a fully implicit scheme .",
    "the non - lagrangian scheme computes the h , he and @xmath14n profiles , but is able to follow the evolution of the other elements in a separate calculation , for use at the transition .",
    "the conversion from one evolutionary scheme into another does not affect the qualitative behavior of the models .",
    "the surface boundary condition is computed differently for the three sub - solar metallicities and the other two metallicities .",
    "the code has the option of using surface pressures derived from computed model atmospheres ( @xcite ) or assuming a t-@xmath15 ( temperature stratification ) relation .",
    "since the model atmospheres are available only in a restricted range in temperature , evolutionary tracks with wide variations in temperature and gravity can not use the model grids for the entire evolution .",
    "we chose to use the model pressures for @xmath16 until the tracks peeled off the rgb , after which we used the lagrangian scheme and the eddington approximation .",
    "the result is a gap in the evolutionary sequences in the more metal poor calculations at the transition point . for higher metallicity models the same procedure",
    "can not be used since the pressure grids , where available , do not cover the range of surface values during the crucial period of rapid mass loss . in this case ,",
    "the eddington approximation was used from the zams .",
    "the stellar models were converted from non - lagrangian co - ordinates to lagrangian co - ordinates at which point @xmath17 after peel - off .    for tip - flashers evolution",
    "was continued until @xmath18 . in the case of the hot flashers and",
    "the s the code ran until it was no longer able to continue the evolution .",
    "this occurred at @xmath19 for the hot flashers . instead of pursuing the lengthy computations required to go through the he flash",
    ", the stars were assumed to appear on a zahb with varying core mass .",
    "zahb models were created using the initialization procedure outlined in dorman , lee , & vandenberg ( 1991 ) , with the hydrogen shell composition profile being extracted from the last converged pre - flash model for each star . since the stars which lose more mass have different ( thinner ) hydrogen burning shells , the relevant composition profile was found for each value of @xmath3 for which the model underwent the helium flash .",
    "we computed a number of rgb models with different values of reimers @xmath3 for [ fe / h ] = @xmath20 @xmath21 and 0.37 .",
    "we chose the initial mass of the stars such that their ms ages were between 12.5 and 14.5gyr . thus , in our discussion below we will be considering different stellar populations at roughly constant age . at each metallicity , we calculated rgb models for @xmath22 .",
    "we increased @xmath3 in steps of 0.05 for @xmath23 until there were at least two he - wd tracks for each metallicity .",
    "a summary of the calculations for all the metallicities is given in table 1 .",
    "to8.0 in    ' '' ''    to3.5 in    ' '' ''    all models of the same metallicity are grouped together , with the metallicity and initial stellar mass , @xmath24 , indicated at the beginning of each group .",

    "the second and third columns contain the final mass , @xmath25 , and the he - core mass , @xmath26 , of the stars respectively .",
    "the final envelope masses , @xmath27 , of the rgb models are given in the fourth column .",
    "the asterisks denote convective envelopes , the rest of the envelope masses being the difference between the core mass and the total stellar mass .",
    "the fifth column , titled `` remark '' , indicates the evolutionary behavior of the models i.e.  a star marked as `` he - flasher '' is a classic rgb tip flasher , while a remark of `` rgb peel - off , he flasher '' indicates a hot he - flasher , and `` rgb peel - off , he wd '' means that the star peeled - off the rgb and failed to ignite helium .",
    "the hr diagram of the rgb tracks for the models listed in table 1 are shown in figure  [ fig : rgb ] .",

    "the solid lines are the tracks of flashing models , the dotted ones are  models .",
    "the location of the helium flash for stars that flash away from the rgb are indicated by open diamonds and have the corresponding @xmath3 value listed next to them .",
    "the break in the peel - off tracks is where the conversion from non - lagrangian to lagrangian co - ordinates takes place .",
    "we see from figure  [ fig : rgb ] and table 1 that there is a range of masses for which models peel - off the rgb but still undergo the helium flash for all metallicities .",
    "the hot - flash behavior occurs for values of  23 times larger than that required to produce normal hb stars .",
    "contrary to our initial expectations , hot - flash behavior occurs for a fairly large range of .",
    "some of the peel - off stars show weak hydrogen shell flashes while moving from the rgb to the cooling curve .",
    "this is most clearly seen in the @xmath28 tracks in figure  [ fig : rgb](a ) .",
    "whether these flashes are numerical or due to a real instability is not known .",
    "the models of cc93 do not show similar flashes .",
    "none of our low metallicity models have enhanced oxygen .",
    "enhancement of oxygen and other @xmath29-nuclei elements is often found in metal poor stars ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "increasing oxygen affects rgb evolution in two ways : the rate of evolution is sped up ( at a given luminosity ) and the flash occurs at higher luminosity .",
    "the track in the hr diagram is essentially unshifted , because the opacity at low @xmath30 is dominated by other elements ( renzini 1977 ) . because of the faster evolution the core mass at flash is smaller .",
    "as far as mass loss goes there are compensating factors : there is less time to lose mass as the evolution is faster , but the evolution to higher @xmath8 increases mass loss .",
    "we performed one comparison case with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "as expected the oxygen enhanced models have smaller core masses for both @xmath3 values and the flash occurs at higher @xmath8 for the @xmath34 case . for @xmath35 ,",
    "more mass was lost and the star peels off at higher @xmath8 compared to the @xmath36 case . since our results suggest no change in qualitative behavior with total metallicity we expect the effect of enhanced o to be small .    as noted earlier , the mass loss was terminated when the envelope mass becomes less than @xmath37 . to see whether this assumption affects the hot - flash behavior , we also computed a track in which the mass loss was allowed to continue until the envelope mass was so small that it would be entirely removed within a timestep .",
    "the core mass of the star in this case changed by @xmath38 , which is of the order of the numerical uncertainty in determining the core mass at the he - flash .",
    "this again suggests that the arbitrariness of the point at which mass loss was terminated does not change the qualitative behavior of the models .",
    "one particularly important result to realize here is that the for the hot - flashers is smaller than the ( more or less ) constant value for the tip - flashers and that it decreases as  increases .",
    "it is commonly believed that the rising temperatures in the he core are due to the march of the hydrogen burning shell through the star .",
    "our results show that the core temperatures rise because of the contraction of the core , and that contraction continues whether or not the mass of the core is increasing .",
    "we find that any star which has a surviving h - envelope when its he core is within 0.0150.018  of , the classical core mass at flash , will undergo a he flash . on the rgb near the flash @xmath39 , so any star which gets to within @xmath40mag of the tip luminosity will flash either at the tip or as a hot - flasher . _",
    "hence any mass loss law that produces a substantial fraction of the total mass lost in the upper @xmath40mag of the rgb has the potential to produce a substantial population of hot - flashers .",
    "_ this result , as well as that of castellani  ( 1995 ) implies that there is no minimum envelope mass for the hb .",
    "this finding contradicts the assumption of @xcite that he burning can not be initiated for @xmath41 @xcite seem to have based their assumption on the work of sweigart , mengel , & demarque ( 1974 ) , who used a plausibility argument to suggest that the probability of having hb stars with @xmath42 is small .",
    "the peel - off stars will be indistinguishable from p - eagb stars as they evolve to the cooling curve before the helium flash .",
    "their luminosity ( @xmath43 ) and evolutionary timescale when crossing the hr diagram ( 12 myr ) are similar",
    ". both types of objects would be rare in populations as small as globular clusters because of the brevity of this crossing phase . in a cluster containing 10@xmath44 rgb stars brighter than the hb and with lifetimes of @xmath45yr",
    ", one would expect to find @xmath46 peel - off stars , where @xmath47 is the fraction of rgb stars that peel - off the rgb",
    ". the value of @xmath47 must be less than the fraction @xmath48 .",
    "the globular cluster @xmath49 cen contains the largest fraction of ehb stars at roughly 20% [ dor95 ] . for",
    "this cluster one would expect to have one or no rgb peel - off stars .",
    "this is consistent with the number of stars predicted to exist at this luminosity .",
    "since these stars are so rare and are similar to p - eagb stars , it would be very difficult to verify their existence as such in the galactic field or in integrated light .",
    "zahb models for each composition are shown in figure  [ fig : zahb ] .",
    "to8.0 in    ' '' ''    to5.5 in    ' '' ''    the hot - flashers do not follow the classical zahb as defined by iben & rood ( 1970 ) which is a constant core mass sequence . their helium core mass is less than that of the normal zahb models .",
    "these stars have very small envelopes and hence will be very blue , and slightly less luminous than the regular zahb .",
    "they form a `` blue hook '' at the blue end of the zahb as can be seen in figure  [ fig : zahb ] .",
    "the blue hook stars are a part of the ehb population and have almost the same envelope masses but different helium core masses .",
    "therefore they form a sequence that is fairly constant in temperature but has a spread in luminosity .",
    "the temperature spread is @xmath50 .",
    "the length of the hook can be estimated using @xmath51 to be @xmath52mag .",
    "the blue hook sequence is cooler by @xmath53 than the helium main sequence ( castellani  1995 ) .",
    "blue - hook stars will evolve into  objects with similar behavior to that of the lowest mass `` traditional '' zahb models of dro93 .",
    "both the blue - hook ehb stars and their  progeny will emit considerable uv radiation . we computed the post - rgb evolution of two such models for each metallicity .",
    "the two models that were followed had @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the highest value of @xmath3 for which a helium flash occurs and @xmath57 corresponds to the transition between classic red giant tip flashers and hot he - flashers .",
    "the rest of the zahb stars are expected to evolve as normal ( see dro93 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : agbman ] shows the post - rgb evolutionary tracks of the two blue hook stars whose evolution we computed .",
    "to7.0 in    ' '' ''    to6.0 in    ' '' ''    for the initial vertical part of the tracks ( @xmath58mag ) , evolution is relatively slow and accounts for about 80% of the post - rgb life time .",
    "an ensemble of blue - hook stars will form an almost vertical band of hot hb stars which starts about 0.1 magnitudes below the zahb with @xmath59% of the stars lying within about one magnitude above it . with some imagination",
    "one can see such a sequence in the hot hb stars observed in  ( fig .",
    "10 of @xcite ) .",
    "our use of reimers formula as a mass loss prescription could be questioned .",
    "this formula has no physical basis and was constructed on the basis of observation and dimensional analysis .",
    "there are alternate ways of parametrizing mass loss , none of which have been found to be exceptionally better or worse than reimers formula ( see dupree 1986 ; chiosi & maeder 1986 ) . ideally , one would like to use a mass loss rate that is derived from a mass loss mechanism believed to operate in cool giants . unfortunately the exact mechanism that drives mass loss is not known ; the gross stellar parameters ( temperature , luminosity , gravity , metallicity ) are obviously insufficient to determine the mass loss uniquely . instead , the inferred spread in total mass lost may somehow be tied to individual properties such as rotation rates ( fusi pecci & renzini 1978 ) and magnetic field strengths , and may be related to the abundance variations detected in globular cluster stars ( see kraft 1994 for a review ) .    as for possible physical mechanisms for mass loss , thermally driven winds , wave - driven winds , radiation pressure on molecules and/or dust grains , and winds resulting from shock waves are those most widely cited ( see holzer & macgregor 1985 for a review ) .",
    "it is possible that more than one mechanism operates in a single star simultaneously . for the sun",
    ", it is now believed that the effects of rotation and convection lead to the magneto - hydrodynamic heating of the solar corona , which gives rise to the solar wind ( spruit , nordlund , & title 1990 ) .",
    "observations of cool , low - gravity stars show that the outflowing material is moving with asymptotic velocities that are considerably lower than the escape velocity of the star .",
    "therefore , only a small fraction of the energy that is added to the stellar atmosphere for the purpose of fueling the wind is used to lift the wind out of the gravitational field of the star . from the low asymptotic velocities",
    "one can actually expect to learn very little about the mechanism driving the mass loss since we observe only a small part of the driving energy ( holzer & macgregor 1985 ) .",
    "the electron temperatures in cool supergiants are found to be around 10@xmath60 as opposed to 10@xmath61 for the solar corona , which rules out thermally driven winds ( dupree 1986 ) .",
    "large rates of mass loss also imply that the mass loss mechanism is fairly efficient close to the stellar surface where the densities are relatively high , which in turn places a constraint on the temperature at which the mechanism operates .",
    "observations show that mass loss rates increase with decreasing surface gravity and increasing stellar luminosity .",
    "the mass loss rates themselves are uncertain in some cases to a factor of 5 or even 10 .",
    "obtaining mass loss rates is a complex process and only a few stars have well determined mass loss rates .",
    "the spectral lines ( ca h & k , h@xmath29 , etc ) used to study mass loss originate at different depths in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "hence a better understanding of the atmospheric structure and the origin of the lines is necessary . in the face of our ignorance on this crucial matter",
    ", the reimers formula seems as good a parametrization as any , in that it obeys the observed functional dependences and is dimensionally correct .",
    "the conclusions we draw depend mainly on the escalation of the assumed mass loss rate close to the rgb tip . our generic results for core he burning and beyond should still hold if mass loss rates increase close to the rgb tip at least as sharply as in the reimers formula .",
    "using the reimers formula or any other formulation which depends only on surface parameters , mass loss continues until the star peels off the rgb .",
    "these stars undergo he ignition so long as peel - off occurs sufficiently near ( @xmath62mag ) the rgb - tip . the helium cores are slightly smaller than those produced in rgb tip - flashers , and the ensuing evolution is the hot - flash / blue - hook behavior described here .",
    "we anticipate that a physically motivated mass loss law will almost certainly depend on the global properties of the convective zone . in reality",
    "mass loss may stop as the convective envelope approaches some minimum size @xmath63 . after mass loss",
    "is terminated @xmath64 will continue to decrease as the h burning shell advances .",
    "these stars will still ignite he if the mass loss is turned off within @xmath40mag of the tip .",
    "depending on the circumstances , he ignition could be on the rgb or in a hotter phase",
    ". the core he burning stars resulting from these stars would have envelopes ranging from our small values up to @xmath63 .",
    "the blue - hook will be smeared in .",
    "indeed , the observed degree of smearing of ehb stars can give a clue to the mass loss mechanism .",
    "the `` standard model '' of the hb requires that individual rgb stars arrive on the zahb with a distribution @xmath65 of masses ( rood 1973 ) .",
    "this distribution together with the metallicity gives rise to the different hb morphologies observed in globular clusters .",
    "the distribution has typically been modeled by a gaussian truncated in some way to account for physical limits to the mass ( rood 1973 ) .",
    "_ there was no physical basis for selecting the form of @xmath65 used _",
    ", other than that it seemed to work and that random variables often tend toward being gaussian ( i.e.  the central limit theorem ) .",
    "indeed there are some counter examples where this kind of formalism fails ( e.g. , rood  1993 ; liebert 1994 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the assumption is hard to assess since existing data do not allow us to distinguish easily between different intrinsic mass distributions . below we consider the zahb population to be driven by a function of @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 ) . as far as matching globular cluster hbs ,",
    "the hb mass depends almost linearly on @xmath3 over most of the hb for appropriate compositions .",
    "thus any distribution in @xmath68 can be mapped into a distribution in . in this scheme ,",
    "the star - to - star variation in  is a way of modeling the effects of individual differences among stars that cause the mass dispersion .",
    "one might think of the parameter @xmath69 , for some @xmath29 , which is a set of functions of all the physical variables @xmath70 on which mass loss rates do actually depend . in this way , @xmath29 gives a mapping between the true dependence of mass loss ( including stochastic effects ) and the necessarily inadequate formulation we use here .",
    "for example , the distribution @xmath66 might arise from a stochastic distribution in rotation rates , @xmath71 .",
    "even though we consider only simple distributions for @xmath66 we recognize that quite complex forms for @xmath66 could arise from a simple gaussian @xmath71 . indeed",
    ", smooth variations in quantities like rotation and magnetic fields often lead to bifurcated outcomes .",
    "we now will use our results to consider how the frequency of ehb stars , or more specifically blue - hook stars , might vary with the metallicity of a stellar population .",
    "we have plotted @xmath3 vs [ fe / h ] in figure  [ fig : feheta ] for @xmath3 values that correspond to various hb fiducial points .",
    "to5.0 in    ' '' ''    using @xmath3 as the quantity on which the distribution depends , we can crudely estimate how the zahb population changes with metallicity .",
    "we define @xmath72 to be the largest value of @xmath3 that still produces red hb stars at the zahb .",
    "@xmath73 is the value of @xmath3 that marks the center of the rr lyrae strip ( approximately @xmath74 ) ; @xmath75 ( the value of @xmath3 that produces stars at 10,000 k ) is roughly the hot end of the `` horizontal '' part of the hb .",
    "the transition between the traditional rgb tip - flashers and the hot - flashers is @xmath57 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath3 that allows a helium flash is @xmath56 .",

    "the approximate red end of the ehb population ,  has been indicated with the dashed line in figure  [ fig : feheta ] .",
    "this is a very crude estimate of where the cool end of the ehb population should lie and was obtained by using the post - rgb tracks from dro93 .",
    "there are a number of conclusions one can reach from this figure . throughout bear in mind that there are some ehb stars in globular clusters , and in some , if not all , cases they originate from extreme mass loss evolution in single stars .",
    "for example , there are many ehb stars in , a low density , unrelaxed cluster with few classical indications of stellar interactions such as blue stragglers ( bailyn  1992 ) .",
    "the ehb stars are not concentrated toward the center ; thus even in an unfavorable environment for binary interactions , many such stars are formed ( see dor95 for a discussion of single vs binary origin of ehb stars ) .    in summary , note the following :    at low metallicity the range of values of @xmath3 which produces ehb stars is comparable in magnitude to that producing the normal hb .",
    "_ producing ehb stars requires no more fine tuning than producing ordinary hb stars in globular clusters . _",
    "despite the fact that high metallicity stars must lose more mass to reach the ehb ( for comparable age systems ) they can achieve this larger mass loss with  values that are comparable to those needed for the low metallicity stars .",
    "viewed in this way , it is no more difficult to produce ehb stars at high metallicity than at low , although the corresponding physical interpretation of this result is unclear .",
    "the range of the mid - hb lies approximately from @xmath72 to @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ fig : feheta ] shows that as metallicity increases , this range decreases .",
    "it becomes more difficult to make ordinary blue hb ( ibhb ) stars at higher metallicity  a point made by dor95 but more explicitly demonstrated here .",
    "the zahb becomes increasingly bimodal for metal rich populations .",
    "this is consistent with observations of ngc 6791 which show a lack of ibhb stars and three sdb ( ehb ) stars ( liebert  1994 ) .",
    "the range of values of @xmath3 producing ehb stars is almost constant for all metallicities . to make ehb stars at high metallicity ,",
    "does not have to increase and its distribution does not have to be more fine tuned .",
    "considering the zahb population distribution as a function of  instead of mass leads to a different perspective on the production of ehb stars .",
    "the zahb mass depends almost linearly on @xmath3 till one get close to the blue hook . for the blue hook stars @xmath68 does depend linearly on @xmath3 but with a slope that is different from the rest of the zahb .",
    "the range in @xmath3 for the blue hook is comparable to that of the rest of the zahb , but the range in mass of the blue hook stars is much smaller than the mass range of the zahb stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : feheta ] shows that the ehb is made up of blue hook stars and slightly cooler extremely blue hb stars .",
    "the blue hook stars will contribute substantially to the ehb population if the _ support _ of @xmath66 ( the range of  where @xmath77 is sufficiently great . therefore modeling the distribution of the zahb as a function of @xmath3 ensures a reasonably well populated ehb .",
    "this circumstance arises jointly from the rapid increase in  and the escalation of the mass loss rate close to the rgb tip . in some sense ,",
    "zahb models constructed with a @xmath66 are more directly related to the underlying physics of mass loss than those using @xmath78 since the star `` sees '' mass loss rates , rather than `` knows '' its final zahb location .",
    "figure  [ fig : etatem ] shows the relationship between @xmath3 and  of the zahb stars for the five metallicities used in this paper .",
    "to5.0 in    ' '' ''    the slope , @xmath79 , is larger at the blue and red ends of the zahbs .",
    "the slope of the mid - hb region is seen to decrease as metallicity increases .",
    "this is more clearly shown in figure  [ fig : etatem](f ) where all the curves are superposed on each other .",
    "if the slope of these curves is an indication of the number of stars present at a given effective temperature on the zahb then it can be used to describe the zahb distribution to first order . the number of stars per  interval , n ( , + d ) , will be given by    @xmath80    the normalized slope of these curves is shown in figure  [ fig : detadt ] .",
    "to4.5 in    ' '' ''    note that these curves are not smooth because of the discreteness of the numerical data used to construct them .",
    "the derivatives at the ends are very large .",
    "hence the contrast between the ends and the mid - hb portion is increased relative to anything which could be observed . both observational error and the binning required in a differential",
    "distribution function will smooth the ends .",
    "figure  [ fig : temhist ] shows the effective temperature distribution of a thousand zahb stars resulting from a flat distribution in @xmath3 i.e.  @xmath81 constant .",
    "the flat distribution of a thousand stars illustrated is created by linear interpolation of the zahb models computed from the flashing rgb stars .",
    "one can see that the curves in figure  [ fig : temhist ] compare well with those in figure  [ fig : detadt ] .",
    "to5.0 in    ' '' ''    using @xmath82 both rhb and ehb stars can be produced if @xmath83 in the appropriate range . when cast as a `` final '' mass distribution @xmath65 it appears that fine tuning is required , but",
    "when @xmath66 is used , it becomes clear that a fairly wide range of mass loss behavior produces ehb stars .",
    "however , for the metal rich populations , fine tuning is necessary to populate the mid - hb region .",
    "the bimodal nature of the metal rich zahbs arises both from the increased opacity of the metal rich stars and the increased importance of the h ( via cno cycle ) burning shell .",
    "the envelopes of ehb stars are so small that shell burning is negligible and the opacity changes the temperature without affecting the structure ( dorman 1992b ) .",
    "the temperature of the rhb is basically determined by the position of the hayashi line ( fully convective stars ) . as metallicity increases , both the opacity and h shell burning `` push '' stars from the mid - hb toward the hayashi line , thus depopulating the mid - hb .",
    "these flat distributions are instructive because they give a measure of the `` underlying '' effect of mass loss on the stellar mass distribution as the rate is varied .",
    "more realistic distributions as found in some clusters resemble gaussians , or at least are unimodal with small dispersion .",
    "it is easy to see that such dispersion functions will produce sharply peaked mass distributions if the peak lies at a mass corresponding to either high or low temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : gauss ] shows the temperature distributions that result from gaussians of the same width but with different peak locations .",
    "to8.0 in    ' '' ''    to5.5 in    ' '' ''    the gaussian peaks were chosen relative to @xmath57 and are located at @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85 values were chosen such that the width of the corresponding gaussian in mass , @xmath86 , is @xmath87 when the gaussian peak is located at @xmath88 .",
    "we choose a fiducial width of 0.03@xmath89 in mass because that is the typical gaussian width of easily modeled globular cluster hbs .",
    "for the three lower metallicities the distributions change smoothly as the peak @xmath3 decreases .",
    "one can possibly expect to have both rhb and ehb stars using a single gaussian at these metallicities .    at high @xmath90 ,",
    "the zahb distribution is very dependent on the location of the gaussian peak especially if the peak is located within or near the range of @xmath3 corresponding to the mid - hb region .",
    "this is again a consequence of the small range of @xmath3 that corresponds to mid - hb stars in metal rich populations .",
    "the zahb distribution is insensitive to the gaussian peak position if the peak is located anywhere within the region corresponding to rhb stars for the high metallicities .",
    "hence at high metallicities one can not tell the true distribution of the zahb if only rhb stars are present .",
    "also , for both rhb and ehb stars to exist in metal rich populations , one has to use a single gaussian which is very broad ( much larger than estimated for globular clusters ) or use some kind of bimodal distribution .",
    "we have made an extensive study of hot - he - flash stars .",
    "these are stars with such high mass loss rates that they peel - off the rgb before he ignition , but rather than quietly becoming he white dwarfs , ignite he while at high .",
    "after he ignition the hot - flashers settle on a blue - hook at the hot end of the hb and evolve as ehb stars ( dor95 ) .    in the absence of an alternative",
    ", we used the reimers mass loss formula to compute red giant mass loss rates .",
    "we then consider the distribution of initial hb masses as a probability distribution of the reimers efficiency , , rather than directly as a mass probability distribution .",
    "the hot - flash behavior was surprisingly widespread .",
    "for globular cluster abundances the range of  producing ehb stars was comparable to that producing normal hb stars .",
    "as metallicity is increased , the range and magnitude of  leading to ehb stars varies only slightly , whereas the range of  producing mid - hb stars becomes very small . at solar metallicity and higher",
    ", the hb will be composed of a group of very hot and very cool stars with little in between so long as nature provides a broad enough distribution in .",
    "it has been thought for some time that the upturn in the far - uv spectra of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges ( burstein  1988 ) could arise from the uv flux from ehb stars and their progeny ( gr90 ; @xcite ; dro93 ; dor95 ) .",
    "the difficulty has been understanding the origin of the ehb stars in metal rich populations .",
    "we have shown here that it is just as easy to make ehb stars at high metallicity as at low metallicity .",
    "further , we do not require that the helium abundance continue to grow as steeply with metallicity for @xmath91 as is observed at low metallicity ( @xmath92 ) ( horch , demarque , & pinnsoneault 1992 ) . in claiming that it is just as easy to understand ehb stars in elliptical galaxies as in globular clusters , we have , unfortunately , just passed the buck .",
    "we do not really know why some stars in some clusters happen to lose 23 times more mass than the typical star .",
    "but we do have the comfort of knowing that such stars are observed and the hope that more detailed study of these stars can lead to better understanding of stellar evolution and stellar populations .",
