    "the power spectrum of galaxy clustering is the equivalent of the rosetta stone for structure formation in the universe . on large scales ,",
    "the power spectrum is a fossil record of the density fluctuations present at the epoch of recombination . moving to intermediate and small scales ,",
    "the spectrum encodes a wealth of information about different physical processes and effects : the nonlinear evolution of the density field , the modulation of the clustering signal of galaxies relative to that of the underlying dark matter , and , if the spectrum is estimated using the positions of galaxies inferred from their redshifts , the magnitude of peculiar motions and bulk flows .    in the past decade ,",
    "significant progress has been made in measuring the power spectrum of galaxy clustering .",
    "two main approaches have been taken : direct estimation in three dimensions using galaxy redshift surveys ( e.g. tadros & efstathiou 1996 ; hoyle 1999 ; sutherland 1999 ; percival 2001 ) and the deprojection of angular clustering ( e.g. peacock 1991 ; baugh & efstathiou 1993 , 1994a ) . until the advent of the pscz ( saunders 2000 ) and 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colless 2001 ) , angular catalogues ( e.g. the apm survey described by maddox , efstathiou & sutherland , 1996 ) generally covered a much larger volume than that mapped out by the contemporaneous redshift surveys . on completion of the photometric part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which is deeper than the spectroscopic catalogue",
    ", this will once again be the case . with photometric redshifts it will be possible to isolate sdss galaxies in slices in redshift and to apply a deprojection algorithm to the angular clustering measured in each slice in order to quantify the evolution of the power spectrum ( dodelson 2002 ) .",
    "other new angular catalogues are now becoming available .",
    "the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) has mapped the whole sky in the near - infrared , covering a solid angle four times larger than the sdss , albeit to a shallower depth ( jarrett 2000 ) .",
    "( a preliminary estimate of the power spectrum of 2mass galaxies was made by allgood , blumenthal & primack 2001 .",
    "after our paper was refereed , maller ( 2003 ) produced a detailed analysis of the power spectrum of 2mass galaxies in three dimensions , using the completed survey . ) deeper photometric catalogues covering relatively large solid angles are also being constructed , which will allow measurements of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering to be undertaken at high redshift ( e.g. mccracken 2001 ) .",
    "the motivation to develop reliable algorithms to estimate the power spectrum in three dimensions from projected clustering data is therefore clear .",
    "baugh & efstathiou ( 1993 , hereafter be93 ) introduced a technique to invert a variant of limber s equation ( limber 1954 ) , which relates the angular correlation function , @xmath8 , to an integral over the power spectrum , @xmath9 .",
    "the inversion scheme is based upon a bayesian procedure proposed by lucy ( 1974 ) .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that it does not depend upon any prior prejudice about the form of the power spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "a disadvantage of the method is that it does not yield the error on the recovered power spectrum directly .",
    "baugh & efstathiou estimated the error on their measurement by dividing the apm survey into four zones , applying the inversion to the clustering measured in each zone and using the scatter between these estimates to give the errors .",
    "the inversion method was also applied to the angular power spectrum to infer the power spectrum in three dimensions ( baugh & efstathiou 1994 ) and to limber s original equation to obtain the spatial correlation function , @xmath10 ( baugh 1996 ) .",
    "gaztaaga & baugh ( 1998 , hereafter gb98 ) presented tests of the algorithm using mock catalogues constructed from n - body simulations .",
    "several recent papers have proposed new algorithms to invert measurements of projected clustering using matrix techniques which also produce an estimate of the covariance matrix for the power spectrum .",
    "a direct inversion of limber s equation is unstable so various approximations have to be made to overcome this .",
    "dodelson & gaztaaga ( 2000 ) adopted a bayesian prior relating to the smoothness of the power spectrum to stabilise the inversion .",
    "the magnitude of the estimated errors is somewhat sensitive to the choice of smoothing parameter .",
    "these authors also assumed a diagonal covariance matrix and a gaussian distribution of errors for the angular correlation function .",
    "eisenstein & zaldarriaga ( 2001 ) proposed a singular - value decomposition of limber s equation written in matrix form , without smoothing .",
    "these authors used a fit to the power spectrum in two dimensions measured from the apm by baugh & efstathiou ( 1994 ) , and assumed a gaussian distribution of errors to compute the covariance matrix on this quantity .",
    "efstathiou & moody ( 2001 ) devised a maximum likelihood estimator for the power spectrum in three dimensions based upon the measured projected counts of galaxies in cells . again , the fluctuations in cell counts were assumed to be gaussian . in these papers , the assumption of gaussianity limits the range of scales over which the power spectrum can be recovered .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a reliable measurement of the power spectrum in three dimensions , with a robust estimate of the errors on our measurement , using the apm survey as an example .",
    "this paper contains a number of advances over previous work :    * we present a revised version of the lucy algorithm used by baugh & efstathiou ( 1993 ) .",
    "lucy s algorithm has the appeal of simplicity and the iterations converge to the maximum likelihood solution to the inversion of the integral equation ( see lucy 1974 , 1994 ) . *",
    "the assumption of gaussian distributed density fluctuations is not required for the inversion to work .",
    "this means that we can estimate the power spectrum on small scales where the assumption of gaussian fluctuations is a poor one ( e.g. baugh , gaztaaga & efstathiou 1995 ) .",
    "this allows us to measure the power spectrum in a regime that provides a powerful constraint on models of galaxy formation .",
    "* we employ mock catalogues extracted from large n - body simulations to make a robust estimate of the errors on the recovered power spectrum and of the correlation between the measurements at different wavenumbers .",
    "we note that dodelson ( 2002 ) have also used artificial catalogues to estimate the errors on the power spectrum recovered from an early version of the sdss photometric catalogue .",
    "the only assumption we make in our error estimation is that the mock catalogues provide a realistic representation of the sample variance applicable to the case of the apm survey in the real universe .",
    "* we use a new model for the galaxy redshift distribution from the 2dfgrs ( colless 2001 ) based upon the survey selection function derived by norberg ( 2002a ) .    in section 2",
    "we give an overview of the inversion algorithm , presenting tests of the method using mock catalogues and including a comparison of our error estimates with those of other authors .",
    "the algorithm is applied to the apm survey in section 3 and the constraints on the parameters of the cold dark matter model from the measurement of the galaxy power spectrum are presented in section 4 .",
    "we infer the galaxy correlation function , @xmath10 , from the power spectrum in section 5 .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we describe the numerical inversion of limber s equation .",
    "this section is relatively long and detailed , so we have split it up into a number of subsections as follows .",
    "the relativistic form of the integral equation relating the angular correlation function , @xmath8 , to the power spectrum in three dimensions , @xmath9 , is given in section [ ssec : limber ] .",
    "the basic principles of the numerical inversion of this integral equation are set out in section [ ssec : lucy ] .",
    "the modifications to the algorithm of baugh & efstathiou ( 1993 ) that we employ in this paper are explained in section [ ssec : stopping ] .",
    "the evolution of clustering over the redshift interval probed by the apm survey is discussed in section [ ssec : ev ] .",
    "the construction of the mock catalogues used to test the method and to estimate the errors on the recovered spectrum is reviewed in section [ ssec : mocks ] .",
    "the inversion of limber s equation requires the redshift distribution of galaxies to be specified .",
    "the form used for the redshift distribution of apm survey galaxies is justified in section [ ssec : nofz ] .",
    "the role of the mock catalogues in the estimation of the errors on the power spectrum recovered from the inversion is explained in section [ ssec : error_estimation ] .",
    "the numerical inversion is tested using the hubble volume mock catalogues in section [ ssec : app_mocks ] .",
    "finally , we close the section by comparing our estimate of the error on @xmath9 with others in the literature in section [ ssec : error_comp ] .",
    "the angular correlation function , @xmath8 , is related to the real space power spectrum , @xmath9 , through a modified version of limber s equation ( limber 1954 ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and the kernel function , @xmath13 , is defined by ( be93 , note that be93 has a typo in this equation ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the solid angle of the survey , @xmath17 is the surface density of galaxies on the sky , @xmath18 is the comoving distance , and @xmath19 is the redshift distribution of galaxies .",
    "the term @xmath20 depends on the cosmological model ( see e.g. peebles 1980 ; peebles 1993 ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the present day matter density parameter .",
    "the evolution of the power spectrum with redshift is parameterised as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the comoving wavenumber and @xmath25 is a parameter .",
    "this is undoubtedly a simplification but one that is justified by the relatively shallow depth of the apm survey , @xmath26 ( see section [ ssec : nofz ] ) .",
    "we examine the accuracy of this model in section [ ssec : ev ] , in which we also motivate our choice of value for the parameter @xmath25 .      to numerically invert the integral equation relating @xmath8 to @xmath9 , we must first approximate the integral as a discrete summation .",
    "the power spectrum is binned into @xmath27 wavenumbers , @xmath28 , and the angular correlation function is tabulated at @xmath29 angles , @xmath30 . for the @xmath31 iteration of the inversion algorithm ,",
    "the estimate of the power spectrum , @xmath32 , is used to generate a corresponding estimate of the angular correlation function : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is a discretized version of the kernel , in the form of an @xmath35 matrix .",
    "a revised estimate of the power spectrum , @xmath36 , is obtained by comparing the estimated angular correlation function , @xmath37 , with the measured correlation function @xmath38 : @xmath39      lucy ( 1974 ) demonstrated that the algorithm presented in the previous subsection results in an estimate of the unknown quantity , in our case the power spectrum , that tends to the maximum likelihood solution of the integral equation as more iterations are completed . however ,",
    "if too many iterations are performed , the recovered spectrum will not necessarily be smooth , as the solution will attempt to reproduce all the features in the data , including noise .",
    "the problem of how to select an optimum iteration at which to stop the inversion was not addressed in lucy s 1974 paper .",
    "baugh & efstathiou ( 1993,1994 ) chose the `` best '' iteration by inspection of the closeness of the estimated angular correlation function to the measured correlation function , whilst at the same time requiring the corresponding power spectrum to be smooth .",
    "gaztaaga & baugh ( 1998 , gb98 ) attempted to automate this process by computing a @xmath40 value to quantify the level of agreement between the correlation function obtained from the estimate of the power spectrum using limber s equation and the measured angular correlation function .",
    "a plot was made of the value of @xmath40 against iteration number and the estimates of the power spectrum corresponding to local minima in @xmath40 were examined for smoothness . in this paper",
    ", we apply the inversion technique to over two hundred mock catalogues , so neither of the above methodologies is appropriate .    to devise an objective , reliable , and automatic way to choose the best iteration",
    ", we follow a slightly modified version of the approach proposed by lucy ( 1994 ) .",
    "lucy wrote down expressions for quantities related to the likelihood and smoothness of the solution to the integral equation .",
    "the stopping criterion was determined by the way in which the values of the smoothness and likelihood functions changed between consecutive iterations .",
    "we have tailored the stopping criteria devised by lucy to reflect the characteristics of angular correlation function data . in our case ,",
    "the angular correlation function is positive and is a power law at small angles .",
    "the power law has a break around @xmath41 for the case of the apm survey , after which the correlation function drops rapidly in amplitude with increasing angular separation . for each iteration",
    ", we calculate a @xmath40 parameter by comparing the observed correlation function , @xmath42 , with the estimated correlation function , @xmath43 , using @xmath44 bins in @xmath45 around the break , up to the angle for which @xmath46 , at bin @xmath47 : reaches this amplitude is that this is the level of the expected error introduced by the procedure used to calibrate the magnitude scale between apm plates ; see maddox , efstathiou & sutherland ( 1996 ) . ]",
    "@xmath48 the value of @xmath49 is small if the break in the observed angular correlation function is well reproduced by the @xmath50 iteration of the inversion .",
    "we also require a smooth solution for the power spectrum , in accordance with theoretical expectations , given the width of the bins in wavenumber used to tabulate @xmath9 .",
    "we quantify the smoothness of the solution @xmath51 , by computing the following quantity : @xmath52 smoother solutions for @xmath9 will result in smaller values of the function @xmath53 .",
    "we normalise @xmath49 and @xmath53 to their peak values over 40 iterations , and define the goodness of the @xmath50 iteration by the function : @xmath54^{\\alpha } + { \\rm abs}(c^r)^{\\beta } , \\label{eq : goodness}\\ ] ] where the exponents are set to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , reflecting the relative weights given to reproducing the angular correlation data ( in the case of @xmath25 ) or the smoothness of the derived solution ( in the case of @xmath57 ) .",
    "the first local minimum in the quantity @xmath58 is adopted as the best solution to the integral equation .",
    "the precise location of the first local minimum is insensitive to the exact choice of values for @xmath25 and @xmath57 .",
    "= 8.truecm    the value of the parameter @xmath25 that describes the evolution of the power spectrum with redshift ( see equation [ eq : kernel ] ) depends upon the data under consideration . in the case of the mock surveys , for example",
    ", we use @xmath59 , since these catalogues are extracted from the @xmath60 output from an n - body simulation , so by construction there is no evolution of clustering within these samples .",
    "the choice of an appropriate value of @xmath25 to describe the evolution of clustering of galaxies in the apm survey is less straight forward .",
    "the problem can be broken down into two components : ( i ) quantifying the evolution of clustering in the underlying dark matter distribution , and ( ii ) modelling the redshift dependence of galaxy bias .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation predict relatively little evolution in galaxy bias for flux limited samples over the redshift interval spanned by the apm survey ( baugh 1999 ) , so we will ignore the latter of these effects .",
    "we therefore focus our attention on the evolution of the matter power spectrum .",
    "we compute the nonlinear power spectrum of matter fluctuations using the transformation proposed by smith ( 2002 ) , which describes the results of n - body simulations to an accuracy of @xmath61 . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pkevol ] , we plot the power spectrum calculated at @xmath60 and at @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the latter three values correspond , respectively , to the redshifts at which we expect to see @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the galaxies in the apm survey , according to our model for the redshift distribution ( see  [ ssec : nofz ] ) .",
    "we use the efstathiou , bond & white ( 1992 ) fit to the linear theory cold dark matter power spectrum with shape parameter , @xmath67 , with a present day amplitude , specified in terms of the variance in spheres of radius @xmath1mpc , of @xmath68 .",
    "we assume a flat universe with a present day density parameter of @xmath69 and a cosmological constant .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pkevol ] , we show the ratio of the present day nonlinear power spectrum to the power spectra computed at redshifts @xmath62 and @xmath63 , including the correction for evolution given by equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "there are two sets of curves corresponding to two different choices for the value of @xmath25 .",
    "the solid vertical line gives a rough indication of the wavenumber at which we expect the density fluctuations to become nonlinear .",
    "this is estimated by computing the variance of counts - in - cells of apm galaxies as a function of scale , and adopting @xmath70 as a criteria for the onset of nonlinear behaviour ( see e.g. baugh & efstathiou 1994b ; note that we have also assumed that the bias between fluctuations in galaxies and the underlying mass is unity ) . in practise ,",
    "the approximation for the evolution of clustering given by equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) is accurate to within @xmath71 over the range of scales we are interested in . over a more restricted range of scales ,",
    "the approximation performs much better . for wavenumbers",
    "on which we expect the fluctuations to still be in the linear regime , @xmath72 describes the evolution of the power spectrum to an accuracy of @xmath73 . on nonlinear scales ( as quantified @xmath74 ) , a choice of @xmath75 gives an excellent description of the evolution of @xmath9 .",
    "we will therefore use both of these values of @xmath25 in the inversion of the apm angular clustering data .",
    "mock catalogues constructed from the virgo consortium s hubble volume simulations ( evrard 2002 ) are a key component of the inversion algorithm presented in this paper . full details of the construction of these mock catalogues and their properties are given by baugh et al .",
    "( 2003 , in preparation , b03 ; the fabrication of the mock catalogues is also described in norberg 2002a ) . here",
    "we reiterate a few of the points pertinent to our analysis .",
    "the mock catalogues should , by design , display the same clustering as apm survey galaxies .",
    "the clustering of the dark matter in the hubble volume simulations is different from that measured for apm survey galaxies , particularly in the case of @xmath76cdm ( jenkins 1998 ) .",
    "therefore it is necessary to choose particles from the simulation in such a way that the clustering signal of the dark matter at the present day is modulated to match the required galaxy clustering .",
    "we use the second biasing algorithm from cole ( 1998 ) , in which the probability of selecting a dark matter particle to be a `` galaxy '' is a function of the smoothed dark matter density at the present day .",
    "the choice of `` observers '' around which to build the mock catalogues is based on two criteria .",
    "the first of these places the observer at a location in the simulation around which the characteristics of the density and velocity fields are similar to those measured for the local group ( denoted local group observer mocks , see b03 for full details of the conditions ) .",
    "the largest volume constraint used to define a local group environment corresponds to a radius of @xmath77mpc . in the @xmath78cdm hubble volume simulation , 5000 independent test observers could be packed into the simulation volume ; out of these , only 22 satisfied the local group selection criteria .",
    "the second criterion simply places observers at random locations within the simulation box ( hereafter referred to as random observer mocks ) , with the condition that the observers must be separated by a distance of at least @xmath79mpc , in order to minimise overlap between catalogues .",
    "we use 44 local group observers and 21 random observers in total about which to extract mocks from the two hubble volume simulations .",
    "once an observer has been positioned within the hubble volume box , `` galaxy '' particles are chosen in such a way as to reproduce the expected radial selection function of apm galaxies .",
    "we use a model for the apm selection function based on results from the 2dfgrs ( see section [ ssec : nofz ] and",
    "norberg et al .",
    "the catalogues extend to a magnitude limit of @xmath80 ; we explain the extension of the 2dfgrs selection function to this depth in section [ ssec : nofz ] .",
    "the mock catalogues possess the same angular mask as the apm galaxy survey ( maddox 1990 ) .",
    "the median redshift of the mock catalogues is @xmath81 , and they each cover a solid angle of @xmath82 steradians . in most subsequent analyses , the mock catalogues are divided into four zones , equally spaced in right ascension , with a width of around 30 degrees ( see fig . 2 of baugh & efstathiou 1994a ) .",
    "in addition to testing the inversion algorithm , we use mock catalogues to obtain a reliable estimate of the uncertainties in the inversion results , which is an important advance over much previous work .",
    "this requires that we make the assumption that the mock catalogues are independent . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is incorrect because we have used simulations that are single realisations of large volumes .",
    "long wavelength fluctuations can run through the whole of the simulation box , introducing coherency in the density field sampled by different observers .",
    "in practise , this is not an issue as such perturbations are incredibly weak , given the form of the cdm power spectrum . even in the case of local group observers , where one might worry that the sphere of exclusion around each observer is comparatively small , the relative orientation of the mock catalogues and the influence of the selection function mean that there are unlikely to be significant numbers of particles found in common in the mocks around adjacent observers . the only way to have formally independent mocks is to run a dedicated n - body simulation for each catalogue .",
    "this is computationally prohibitive if one wishes to retain the accurate modelling of long wavelength perturbations conferred by using a box size comparable to that employed in the hubble volume simulations .",
    "= 8.truecm    = 8.truecm    the selection function used to construct the mock catalogues is determined by the @xmath60 luminosity function estimated from the 2dfgrs and by the form adopted for the @xmath83 correction ( norberg 2002a ) . at present , the 2dfgrs luminosity function estimate is the most accurate available , displaying , for the first time , random measurement errors that are smaller than the systematic errors ( e.g. choice of @xmath83 correction , uncertainty in the zero - point of the magnitude scale ; see norberg 2002a for a detailed discussion of such effects ) .",
    "the @xmath83 corrections adopted by norberg ( 2002a ) , which compensate for the band - shifting of the @xmath84 filter with redshift and for changes in the stellar population of the galaxy , were first proposed by zucca ( 1997 ) , based on stellar population synthesis models .",
    "a key test of these corrections was carried out by norberg et al .",
    "these authors found that the luminosity function estimates from two subsamples drawn from the 2dfgrs covering disjoint redshift intervals were in excellent agreement .",
    "this means that the form adopted for the @xmath83 correction provides an accurate description of the evolution of galaxy luminosity , at least over the redshift range probed in the test . in the construction of the mock catalogues , b03",

    "it should be noted though , that the solid angle of the mock catalogues corresponds to that of the apm catalogue , which is roughly a factor of @xmath105 larger than the solid angle of the combined sgp and ngp 2dfgrs samples .",

    "the only approximation in our approach is that the mock catalogues provide a realistic description of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "we use the scatter in the recovered power spectra from 260 mock apm zones ( 65 mock observers , with each catalogue split into four zones ) to infer the errors .",
    "the advantage of using such a large number of mocks is that we can take into account any possible covariance between the power spectrum measured at different wavenumbers .",

    "furthermore , the bias would be required to increase with pair separation , which emphasises that this cdm model has the wrong shape of correlation function .",
    "the earlier apm results were used to motivate the need for an anti - bias at small separations , i.e. a reduction in galaxy clustering relative to the dark matter in the @xmath78cdm model ( gaztaaga 1995 , jenkins 1998 ) .",
    "the comparison with the new correlation function estimate shows that the anti - bias required is much less dramatic than before .    the bottom line on bias changes again if we use a more realistic model for the power spectrum than the simple @xmath152 model .",

    "<S> we measure the power spectrum of galaxy clustering in real space from the apm galaxy survey . </S>",
    "<S> we present an improved technique for the numerical inversion of limber s equation that relates the angular clustering of galaxies to an integral over the power spectrum in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is underpinned by a large ensemble of mock galaxy catalogues constructed from the hubble volume n - body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the mock catalogues are used to test for systematic effects in the inversion algorithm and to estimate the errors on our measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we find that we can recover the power spectrum to an accuracy of better than @xmath0 over three decades in wavenumber . </S>",
    "<S> a key advantage of the use of mock catalogues to infer errors is that we can apply our technique on scales for which the density fluctuations are not gaussian , thus probing the regime that offers the best constraints on models of galaxy formation . on large scales , </S>",
    "<S> our measurement of the power spectrum is consistent with the shape of the mass power spectrum in the popular `` concordance '' cold dark matter model . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy power spectrum on small scales is strongly affected by nonlinear evolution of density fluctuations , and , to a lesser degree , by galaxy bias . </S>",
    "<S> the _ rms _ variance in the galaxy distribution , when smoothed in spheres of radius @xmath1mpc , is @xmath2 and the shape of the power spectrum on large scales is described by a simple fitting formula with parameter @xmath3 ( these errors are the @xmath4 ranges for a two parameter fit ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use our measurement of the power spectrum to estimate the galaxy two point correlation function ; the results are well described by a power law with correlation length @xmath5mpc and slope @xmath6 for pair separations in the range @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> methods : statistcial - methods : numerical - large - scale structure of universe - galaxies : formation </S>"
