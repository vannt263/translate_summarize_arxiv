    "in the context of ads / cft , entanglement entropy of the boundary quantum field theory can be calculated using the ryu - takayanagi @xcite prescription and its generalizations to higher curvature gravity theories .",
    "the derivation of this holographic entanglement entropy for two derivative einstein gravity was proposed by lewkowycz and maldacena in @xcite .",
    "this derivation allows one to obtain a surface equation ( for static situations ) for the entangling surface which minimizes an entropy functional .",
    "there were attempts to extend this calculation to find the entangling surface equation in higher curvature theories in @xcite and the corresponding entropy functionals were argued to be different from the wald entropy @xcite . in particular , for lovelock theories the entropy functional is the so - called jacobson - myers ( jm ) @xcite one while for general four derivative theories , it coincides with the fursaev - patrushev - solodukhin ( fps ) entropy functional @xcite .",
    "however , there still exist problems in finding the entangling surface using the lewkowycz - maldacena method and there are potential ambiguities related to higher order extrinsic curvature terms in the entropy functionals .",
    "moreover , it leads one to wonder if such entropy functionals could arise independent of ads / cft from different and perhaps more fundamental considerations .",
    "wald and collaborators @xcite had established the first law for black hole mechanics for any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity and proposed that the entropy of a black hole is a noether charge associated with the killing isometry generating the horizon .",
    "the wald entropy suffers from various ambiguities @xcite and therefore does not provide a unique answer for the horizon entropy .",
    "although , none of these ambiguities contribute to black hole entropy of a stationary killing horizon with regular bifurcation surface , the study of the second law of black hole mechanics beyond general relativity ( gr ) shows that these ambiguities need to be carefully included in the expression of black hole entropy to obtain an increase theorem similar to hawking area theorem in gr .",
    "in fact , for black holes in lovelock gravity , it is the jm functional which leads to an increase theorem for linearized perturbations @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that the 2nd law for spherically symmetric black holes is satisfied at linear order in perturbations in general four derivative theories of gravity by the holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) functionals @xcite .",
    "this has been also generalized beyond spherical symmetry and to generic perturbations up to linear order @xcite and a detailed construction of the entropy functionals has been proposed for any metric theory of gravity such that the linearized second law holds true . for theories with higher curvature terms , the construction produces the hee functionals .",
    "this is a remarkable result since it allows for a way independent of ads / cft of deriving entropy functionals  these same entropy functionals therefore find applications in diverse settings .",
    "however , what still needs to be addressed is if only the hee functionals alone do this job . in this paper",
    ", we first show that at linear order in perturbations only the hee functionals can satisfy the second law .",
    "we start with an expression for horizon entropy with all possible ambiguous terms relevant for linear order in perturbation .",
    "we fix these terms by demanding the validity of the linearized second law and the final entropy coincides with hee functionals . to be clear ,",
    "since our analysis is going to be perturbative , we will not be able to rule out higher order extrinsic curvature terms in the functionals ( e.g. @xmath0 in the fps functional)see section 5 .",
    "we will tackle the question keeping in mind two different motivations .",
    "first , we are interested in what happens in the case of asymptotically flat black holes",
    ". we will consider two different types of perturbations ",
    "the first kind will be due to radially symmetric , slowly falling matter and the second kind being a shear perturbation .",
    "we will find that for the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) theory , if we go to second order in perturbations , the second law is automatically satisfied for regular horizons if the gb coupling is positive .",
    "if the gb coupling is negative then a certain lower bound on the horizon radius ensures that the second law is satisfied ; since this suggests that such black holes can not be formed from collapsing matter , one can take this as an indication that the negative coupling is disfavoured .",
    "if we consider a ricci - square theory then we find that similar extra conditions on the mass of the black hole may be needed for the second law to hold .",
    "second , we are interested in what happens in the context of ads / cft",
    ". we will find that for the gb theory , the second order analysis leads to a bound on the gauss - bonnet coupling . for black branes , this bound coincides with the absence of sound channel instabilities at the black hole horizon .",
    "a similar analysis for the ricci- square theory bounds the corresponding coupling constant . for gb topological black holes @xcite ,",
    "for the zero mass case we find that the second law bound coincides with the tensor channel causality constraint @xcite .",
    "this bound is what leads to the lower bound on the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in the dual plasma and agrees with the lower bound on the @xmath1 ratio in 4d cfts @xcite with @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "we also investigate quadratic theories with @xmath3 and @xmath4 terms . in these theories ,",
    "the causality constraints following from @xcite are trivial whereas the second law bound in certain examples we study is nontrivial .    using the hee entropy functionals and the raychaudhuri equation",
    ", we then turn to the question of holographic c - theorems .",
    "we will argue that the holographic c - functions found in @xcite arise naturally from such a consideration provided the matter sector satisfies the null energy condition . in @xcite , a derivation for the c - functions in einstein gravity , found in @xcite , was given using the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "in @xcite an attempt was made to extend this to higher curvature theories using the iyer - wald prescription .",
    "unfortunately the resulting functions do not give the correct central charge ( namely the a - type anomaly coefficient in even dimensions ) .",
    "in @xcite it was observed that in all sensible holographic models , which can be constructed by demanding the absence of higher derivative terms in the radial direction ( to ameliorate the problem of ghosts ) allow for a simple c - function which at the fixed points coincide with the a - type anomaly coefficient in even dimensions .",
    "this c - function was monotonic under rg flow provided the matter sector satisfied the null energy condition .",
    "we will find that using the hee entropy functionals and considering the raychaudhuri equation naturally leads to the same c - functions as in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the ambiguities in wald s noether charge construction . in the section [ second - set ]",
    "set up for proving second law has been described .",
    "next , we determine the coefficients of the ambiguous terms in wald s construction using linearized second law . in section [ beyond ] ,",
    "we go beyond linear order in perturbation to study the gb theory and determine bound on the coupling parameter using ads black hole solution with different horizon topologies as background .",
    "we also consider various other examples like critical gravity theories and put bounds on the couplings in those theories . in section 6 ,",
    "we derive holographic c - functions using the hee functionals and the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "we end this paper by discussing several follow - up questions .",
    "we use @xmath5 signature and set @xmath6 throughout the paper .",
    "let us start by describing the geometry of the horizon of a stationary black hole in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "the event horizon is a null hyper - surface @xmath8 parameterized by a non - affine parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the vector field @xmath10 is tangent to the horizon and obeys non - affine geodesic equation @xmath11 with @xmath12 is the surface gravity of the horizon ( @xmath13 are bulk indices ) .",
    "all @xmath14 constant slices are co - dimension @xmath15 space - like surfaces and foliate the horizon .",
    "we construct another auxiliary null normal to the @xmath14 constant slices @xmath16 , and the inner product between @xmath17 and @xmath16 satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "the induced metric on any @xmath19 constant slice of the horizon is now constructed as @xmath20 .",
    "the horizon binormals are then given by @xmath21 .",
    "the change in the induced metric along these two null directions can be expressed as a sum of trace part and a trace - free symmetric part ( assuming null congruences are hypersurface orthogonal therefore have zero twist ) .",
    "the trace part measures the rate of change of the area of the horizon cross section along the null generators which is known to be the expansion and the other part measures the shear of the null geodesic congruences .",
    "we denote @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be the two expansion parameters in these two null directions and similarly we have two shears @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath22 and @xmath24 typically vanish on a stationary horizon but @xmath26 and @xmath27 in general do not vanish .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the entropy of a stationary black hole in any general covariant theory is given by the noether charge associated with the boost symmetry generating killing vectors at the horizon @xcite .",
    "the wald entropy functional for any general covariant lagrangian @xmath28 in @xmath7 dimension takes the form : s_w = - 2 _ _ ab _ cd da,[wald_exp ] where @xmath29 denotes any horizon slice and @xmath30 is the area element .",
    "@xmath31 is the riemann tensor of bulk geometry and @xmath32 is the area of the @xmath33 dimensional cross - sections of horizon .",
    "this formula gives a unique expression for entropy so long one is confined to any stationary slice or to the bifurcation surface of the horizon .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the entropy expression constructed via noether charge approach has several ambiguities if one tries to apply it for nonstationary slices of the horizon .",
    "in fact it turns out , the wald entropy formula is just one of several possible candidates for the entropy . in @xcite ,",
    "jacobson , kang and myers ( jkm ) identified three different types of ambiguities which may alter the wald construction . among these ,",
    "the only relevant one for our purpose will be the one which gives us the freedom to add to the wald entropy a term of the form with arbitrary coefficients : s_a^(jkm)=-2_x.y da [ ambi ] where the integrand is invariant under a lorentz boost in a plane orthogonal to an arbitrary horizon slice @xmath29 but the terms @xmath34 and @xmath35 are not separately boost invariant @xcite .",
    "these ambiguities vanish for killing horizons but do not necessarily vanish on a nonstationary slice of the horizon . as a result",
    "the entropy functional for a nonstationary horizon may be expressed as and one spacelike @xmath36 normal such that , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath39 for that codimension-2 surface with a induced metric @xmath40 defined as , @xmath41 trace of this is defined as @xmath42 .",
    "also we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath7 is the dimension of the bulk spacetime . ] ",
    "= - 2 _ da . [ genn1]0.5 cm here we have used the notation @xmath45 . as can be seen from ( [ genn1 ] ) that the ambiguous terms in the entropy formula involve equal number of @xmath46 and @xmath47 subscripts which follows from the fact that these are the only boost invariant combinations that can appear in the entropy functional . also on a stationary slice",
    "the ambiguity terms vanish and then the expression coincides with the wald formula ( [ wald_exp ] ) . the first law of black hole mechanics @xcite does nt fix the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 uniquely .",
    "so , to fix the coefficients of these terms one is thus forced to examine whether @xmath50 obeys a local increase law .    recently in @xcite , the second law has been shown to hold for any arbitrary higher curvature theories if one allows only linear perturbations to a stationary black hole .",
    "this analysis also shows , the entropy functional proposed in the context of holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) @xcite remarkably matches with the @xmath50 .",
    "however , it is not apparent from this analysis how just one condition ( entropy increases along @xmath9 ) fixes two coefficients in the entropy functional ! in this paper , we will show explicitly how this fixing happens for curvature squared gravity theories .",
    "note that the unknown coefficients are sitting in front of products of shear and expansion terms .",
    "since shear and expansion belong to different irreducible parts of a tensor , they will remain separated even when perturbation is turned on at the linearized level .",
    "consequently we will obtain two independent equations when we demand that entropy increase law holds for every slice of the horizon .",
    "this fixes all the coefficients of the entropy functional uniquely for generic quadratic curvature gravity .",
    "it is important to mention that we have only considered ambiguities which are quadratic order in expansion and shear .",
    "we may also have higher powers of such products added to the entropy functional .",
    "however , we can not fix such terms using linearized second law but in curvature squared theories these terms do not enter at linear order @xcite .",
    "our analysis matches with the result obtained in @xcite where the coefficients were fixed for ricci@xmath51 theory using a vaidya like solution in the linearized increase law .",
    "let us turn to the apparatus needed to verify the second law of black hole mechanics .",
    "the equation of motion for a generic higher curvature metric theory of gravity will be of the form , g_ab+h_ab=8t_ab[eqm ] , where @xmath52 is the einstein tensor coming from the einstein - hilbert part of the action and @xmath53 is the part coming from higher curvature terms  in theories with a cosmological constant there will also be an additional term proportional to the metric which we can absorb into @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath54 is the energy momentum tensor which we will assume to obey the null energy condition ( nec ) : @xmath55 for some null vector @xmath17 .",
    "we will use the raychaudhuri equation for null geodesic congruence which describes the evolution of the expansion along the horizon generating parameter @xmath9 . in nonaffine",
    "parametrization this looks like = _ k --_k^2-r_kk.[ray1 ] our notation is @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "now , we define an entropy density for any generic higher curvature theory as :  = _ ( 1 + ) d^d-2x , [ entropyg ] where @xmath58 contains contribution from the higher curvature terms including ambiguities . for general relativity , @xmath59 . in the stationary limit",
    "@xmath60 will coincide with the wald expression ( [ wald_exp ] ) .",
    "now from this expression the change in entropy per unit area gives us the following expression of generalized expansion @xmath61 , = + _ k ( 1 + ) .",
    "[ theta ] the evolution of @xmath61 is governed by the following equation , - = & -&8t_kk-(1+)-_k^2 ( 1+)+_k + & + & h_kk+-r_kk-[ray2 ] , where we have used the equation of motion ( [ eqm ] ) and inserted eq .",
    "( [ ray1 ] ) .",
    "we can now write eq , ( [ ray2 ] ) in a convenient form [ ray3 ] -=-8t_kk+e_kk , where [ eqn2 ] e_kk= h_kk+_k -r_kk+k^ak^b_a_b - ( + _ k^2)(1 + ) .",
    "we have used @xmath62 and @xmath63 next , consider a situation when a stationary black hole is perturbed by some matter flux obeying nec .",
    "the perturbation can be parametrized by some dimensionless parameter @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath65 is linear ( @xmath66 ) in perturbation and so as @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "now , to establish a linearized second law we ignore higher order terms in eq .",
    "( [ ray3 ] ) .",
    "then , it is easy to see then eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) reduces to , e_kk_k _ k - r_kk + h_kk[ekkl ] .",
    "we have already mentioned that @xmath65 is of order @xmath64 , so if the rest of the terms in ( [ ray3 ] ) are also collectively of higher order , i.e.,@xmath70 , then we obtain    - = - 8 t_kk .",
    "the above equation implies @xmath71 , on every slice of the horizon .",
    "we assume that in the asymptotic future , the horizon again settles down to a stationary state , we must have @xmath72 in the future .",
    "this will imply that @xmath61 must be positive on every slice prior to the future and as a result the entropy given by ( [ entropyg ] ) obeys a local increase law .    therefore , to establish the linearized second law",
    ", we only need to show that the linear order terms in @xmath73 exactly cancel each other .",
    "interestingly , this alone will be enough to obtain the values of both the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 introduced in the entropy functional ( [ gen1 ] ) . in the next section",
    ", we will demonstrate this explicitly for the curvature squared gravity theories .",
    "we start with the most general second order higher curvature theory of gravity in five dimensions .",
    "the action of such a theory can be expressed as , s = d^5x ( r- 2 + r^2 + r_abr^ab + l_gb ) [ flag ] where @xmath74 is the gauss- bonnet ( gb ) combination and @xmath75 is the cosmological constant .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such a theory admits a stationary black hole solution as in the case of gr .",
    "we also expect to have a non stationary black hole solution with in - falling matter by perturbing this solution .",
    "such a spacetime will be the counterpart of the vaidya solution in general relativity for spherically symmetric case and can be expressed as ,    [ vd1 ] ds^2=-f(r , v ) dv^2 + 2 dv dr + r^2d_3 ^ 2 @xmath76 can be any three dimensional space with positive , negative or zero curvature .",
    "we want to use this solution to investigate the issue of second law of black hole mechanics . note that , the location of the event horizon @xmath77 for this solution can be obtained by by solving the following equation , [ hor ] r= = . with appropriate boundary condition .",
    "note that , @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote respectively derivative with respect to @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the null generator of the event horizon is given by @xmath82 and the corresponding auxiliary null vector @xmath83 .",
    "the event horizon has nonzero expansion due to the perturbation caused by in falling matter .",
    "next , we will write the entropy associated with the horizon as ,  = - 2 _ da . [ gen1]we consider several choices of the coefficients @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 etc and study the evolution of this horizon entropy .",
    "the aim is to fix the unknown coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 for different gravity theories by demanding the validity of the linearized second law .",
    "we will first study the local increase law for gauss - bonnet ( gb ) case .",
    "this corresponds to the choice @xmath89 in ( [ flag ] ) .",
    "the action is : s = d^5x . where we have also introduced a matter sector obeying the nec .",
    "@xmath90 is a coupling constant of dimension @xmath91 .",
    "the equation of motion for this theory is given by ,    [ eom ] g_ab+g_ab+ h_ab=8 g t_ab .",
    "with , @xmath92 -\\frac{1}{2}g_{ab } { \\cal l}_{gb}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we start with the expression of the entropy functional ( [ entropyg ] ) and evaluate the entropy density for the egb theory .",
    "this is given by sum of wald entropy density plus the ambiguity terms ,     & = & _ ( 1 + ) d^3x , + & = & _ ( 1 + 2(r + 4 r_kl - 2 r_klkl - p _ k_l - q _ k _ l ) ) d^3x , [ eee ] where @xmath93 is the contribution from the wald construction . also @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    "the egb theory belongs to the general lovelock class of action functions which give rise to quasi linear equation of motions .",
    "it has already been shown in @xcite that black holes in all lovelock theories obey a linearized second law if one uses the jm entropy functional .",
    "for egb gravity , the jm entropy functional is the intrinsic ricci scalar @xmath96 of the horizon slice and using the null gauss - codazzi equation we can cast @xmath97 as ,    [ jmgb ] = r + 4r_kl - 2 r_klkl-43_k_l+2_k_l",
    ".    we will now explicitly show below that in egb gravity the entropy functional which obeys the second law is indeed the jm entropy by fixing the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 in ( [ eee ] ) .",
    "first , we proceed to evaluate the _ rhs _ of eq .",
    "( [ ray3 ] ) to study the second law .",
    "note that , if we use the metric ( [ vd ] ) with the choice of @xmath98 to be a flat metric then the shear term in ( [ ray3 ] ) will vanish identically and @xmath49 will remain undetermined .",
    "this happens because isometries of the metric on a horizon slice essentially coincides with that of a sphere .",
    "so we will break the symmetry by adding a cross term and the metric on the horizon slice takes the form , ds^2=-f(r , v ) dv^2 + 2 dv dr + r^2 ( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 + _ 1 h(r , v ) dx dy ) .",
    "we will assume that this shear mode @xmath99 will be balanced by some matter stress tensor still obeying the nec .",
    "also we do not require to find the explicit form of @xmath99 for our analysis .",
    "we will calculate @xmath73 order by order in @xmath100 and extract the coefficients of the linear order terms in @xmath64 from the evolution equation . setting those terms to zero",
    "will satisfy the linearized second law and in the process @xmath48 and @xmath49 will be determined .",
    "below we quote expressions for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for this solution .",
    "[ exp1 ] _ k=+(_1 ^ 2 ) , [ shear1 ] _",
    "l=+(_1 ^ 2 ) and _ k_l=-+(_1 ^ 4 ) .",
    "now evaluating @xmath73 and extracting the zeroth order terms in @xmath103 ( and linear order in @xmath64 ) , we get the following equation , ( 4 - 3 p)=0 . from @xmath104 terms ( which is when @xmath99 makes its first appearance )",
    "we get another equation , 2(-6 + 6p+q ) h(r , v)^2 + 3(2 - 3p - q)h(r , v)r(v)h(r , v)+(2+q)r(v)^2h(r , v)^2=0 .",
    "it is evident that , both of these equations are satisfied if @xmath105 this shows that linearized second law fixes all the quadratic ambiguities in entropy functional ( [ gen1 ] ) uniquely and it is the jm entropy which obeys the linearized second law for gb black holes ! although we have shown this calculation using the 5-dimensional lagrangian for concreteness , the same result holds in any dimension @xmath106 .",
    "let us repeat the above analysis for other curvature squared theories .",
    "first we take @xmath107 theory and we set @xmath108 and @xmath109 in ( [ flag ] ) .",
    "we will start with the following entropy functional ,    [ e1 ] ",
    "= d^3 x ( 1 - 2(r_kl - p_k_l - q_k_l ) ) .",
    "when @xmath48 and @xmath49 are zero then this reduces to the corresponding wald entropy for the stationary case . again proceeding as before we will use the linearized second law to fix these coefficients . like the gauss - bonnet case we get two independent equations and solving them we get , @xmath110 as argued in @xcite , the shear part has not contributed to the entropy functional at linear order and the other coefficient of the entropy functional exactly matches with the one which has been shown to obey the linearized second law in @xcite .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath111 and @xmath112 in ( [ flag ] ) and the entropy functional now reads , [ e2 ] ",
    "= d^3 x ( 1 + 2(r - p_k_l - q_k._l ) .",
    "it has already been argued in @xcite that @xmath113 theory obeys a linearized second law and the wald entropy functional itself does the job .",
    "it is clear , in this case setting @xmath48 and @xmath49 equal to zero will correspond to the wald entropy .",
    "if we again repeat the linearized second law analysis we find ,",
    "@xmath114 so this is exactly what is expected from the earlier analysis in @xcite .",
    "therefore , considering all the individual terms in ( [ flag ] ) we have demonstrated that for any general curvature squared theory we can fix the entropy functional completely using only the linearized second law .",
    "in this section , we will consider local entropy increase law beyond linear order which means we are not allowed to neglect the terms in ( [ ray3 ] ) which have been thrown away in the previous section .",
    "now we will be considering all the relevant terms in equation ( [ ray3 ] ) and will determine the criteria such that second law holds non - perturbatively in the coupling .",
    "for this , we will assume a spherically symmetric vaidya like solution .",
    "this means , the metric in ( [ vd1 ] ) will now have the following form , [ vd ] ds^2=-f(r , v ) dv^2 + 2 dv",
    "dr + r^2d_3 ^ 2 . in fact for egb gravity one can obtain such a solution just setting the mass in the static spherically symmetric boulware - deser @xcite solution to be a function of the advanced time @xmath80 .    beyond linearized level , one has to evaluate the full @xmath73 in the evolution equation ( [ ray3 ] ) . since the solution is spherically symmetric , shear is identically zero . in fact , for this particular case the evolution equation will be of the form , -=-8t_kk-^2_k , note that we must have @xmath115 to have a local entropy increase law . also , we have @xmath116 by nec .",
    "now consider a situation where the stationary black hole is perturbed by some matter flux and we are examining the second law when the matter has already entered into the black hole . in that case",
    ", the above evolution equation does not have any contribution from matter stress energy tensor and the evolution will be driven solely by the @xmath117 term .",
    "so we will have a equation of the form , -=-^2_k .",
    "in such a situation , if we demand the entropy is increasing , we have to fix the sign of the coefficient of @xmath117 term .",
    "we evaluate the coefficient in the stationary background and impose the condition that overall sign in front of @xmath118 is negative .",
    "this will give us a bound on the parameters of the theory under consideration .",

    "now we consider the boulware - deser ( bd ) @xcite black hole as the background , for which , f(r)=1 + .",
    "also , [ eqn3 ] r_h^2 + 2=m determines the location of the horizon .",
    "existence of an event horizon demands @xmath124 . in this case",
    "horizon topology is a sphere . now , evaluating @xmath120 for the above background at the horizon @xmath125 , we get the following inequality < 0 , [ ineq ] which leads to @xmath126 to understand this better , note that we require @xmath127 to avoid the naked singularity of the black hole solution for @xmath128 . thus in this case for a spherically symmetric black hole @xmath120 will be positive and hence second law will be automatically satisfied . the condition of the validity of the second law is same as that for having a regular event horizon .    also , for @xmath129 , it is possible to make @xmath130 as small as possible by tuning the mass @xmath131 .",
    "but when @xmath90 is negative ( a situation that appears to be disfavoured by string theory , see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath130 can not be made arbitrarily small and it would suggest that these black holes can not be formed continuously from a zero temperature set up .",

    "we end this section with one last comment . instead of putting a bound on the gauss - bonnet coupling , one can try to modify the entropy functional @xmath50 itself so that all the @xmath139 terms will be canceled .",
    "one possible modification is to add a term like @xmath157 which vanishes on the stationary horizon and boost invariant in the null direction .",
    "so this type of higher order ambiguous term can occur in the wald derivation .",
    "we modify @xmath50 as , s_modify = d^3 x ( 1 + 2 + _",
    "k^2_l^2 ) . @xmath120 in ( [ betajm ] ) will be modified as , [ modeq ] = so we can adjust @xmath158 such that the @xmath120 vanishes and second law automatically holds up to @xmath139 .",
    "one may also can add a term like @xmath159 at this order where @xmath160 is the covariant derivative with respect to the surface index .",
    "but these additional terms will generate further higher order terms starting from @xmath161 so one will need to add more terms to cancel them . it might possible to do this recursively .",
    "however , the coefficients of these terms will also depend on the background data .",
    "so it will be prudent not to modify the entropy functional .",
    "we have put a bound on the coupling instead of modifying the entropy functional at @xmath139 order such that second law continues to hold up to this order .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate what happens to this bound on @xmath146 when one goes beyond @xmath139 order .",
    "first consider the asymptotically flat black hole with spherically symmetric horizon in 5d . in this case , = 13(1++ f(r , v)+f(r , v)- f(r , v ) ) now , to extract a bound , we need an explicit form of a spherically symmetric static black hole solution in @xmath162 theory . we are not aware of any such solution except the 5d schwarzschild solution of gr which is also a solution of @xmath162 theory .",
    "so , as an example we take such a solution as the background and write , f(r)=1- .",
    "then the validity of the second law gives us the condition , > .",

    "again as discussed in [ bd - bnd ] , minimum @xmath130 scenario would appear pathological and may be taken as a reason to disfavour the @xmath164 sign .",
    "we repeat the same analysis of the previous section for @xmath107 theory but with the background as an asymptotically ads black brane in 5d .",
    "the metric function is then given by f(r)= f_(1-(r_h / r)^4 ) where @xmath166 and it satisfies the equation , 1-f_+_2 f_^2=0 .",
    "in this case we obtain , = ( + f(r , v)+- ) , define @xmath167 and after evaluating on the horizon with the above metric function as background , we get = - . from this , the bound becomes , _ 2 < . in this case",
    "if we repeat out analysis for a zero mass hyperbolic black hole we obtain a lower bound on @xmath168 . combining them we get , - < _ 2",
    "if we repeat the same analysis for 4d and obtain the following bound , @xmath169 no analog of such a bound in the context of ads / cft is known in this case .",
    "this analysis also suggests that the second law bound arising from hyperbolic horizons is not necessarily connected to the causality constraints .",
    "the reason is that for these theories , in the analysis of @xcite , we only get @xmath170 .",
    "we will now consider bounds arising from the second law in quadratic curvature theories with a negative cosmological constant , which only involve terms like @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the case of critical gravity @xcite .",
    "for any theory with only ricci@xmath51 or @xmath4 , the positive energy condition of hofman - maldacena @xcite does not yield any constraint ( see @xcite for general expressions ) except for the positivity of the two point function of stress tensors which follows from unitarity .",
    "in all the examples below , the positivity of black hole entropy leads to the same condition arising from demanding @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the coefficient in the two point function of cft stress tensors .",
    "the second law constraint will lead to further conditions as we will see .",
    "the action for the 4d version of critical gravity is given by , s = d^4x ( r+ + l^2(r_abr^ab - r^2 ) ) [ clag ] in general this theory posses a massive spin-2 mode in addition to the usual massless spin-2 degree of freedom .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite , at @xmath172 , which is called the critical point , the additional massive spin-2 mode becomes massless .",
    "also , at the critical point the entropy of the schwarzschild - ads black hole becomes zero .",
    "we will now use the second law to put a bound on the coupling @xmath84 . proceeding as before at the second order",
    "we get , = ( -+ l^2 f(r , v)- l^2 r(v ) f(r , v ) ) . in this case , we take the background as , f(r)= ( 1-()^3 ) . from this",
    "we get the bound on the coupling as , [ b1 ] .",
    "also , the black hole entropy has to be positive  if it was zero then it must remain zero at all times . from this",
    "we have the following condition , 1 + 2>0 .",
    "so , [ b2 ] > - . combining ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) we get , [ b3 ] - < .",
    "now from the ads / cft perspective it is natural to assume the positivity of the coefficient @xmath173 of two point correlator of boundary stress tensor . that will give exactly the same condition as in ( [ b2 ] ) which is weaker than ( [ b3 ] ) . repeating the same analysis for a zero mass hyperbolic black hole we did not any further bounds .",
    "next we consider the critical gravity theory in 5d .",
    "the action is given by ,    s = d^5x ( r+ + l^2(r_abr^ab - r^2 ) ) [ clag ] the critical point now corresponds to @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "proceeding as before at the second order we get , = ( + + l^2 f(r , v)- l^2 r(v ) f(r , v ) ) . in this case , the background solution is taken as , f(r)= f_(1-()^4 ) , where the quantity @xmath175 satisfies the equation , @xmath176 the second law thus leads to , [ b4 ] - . again demanding the entropy to be positive we get , @xmath177 from which @xmath178",
    "thus we have , [ b6 ] - < .",
    "if we repeat our analysis for a zero mass hyperbolic black hole , the resulting bound we obtain is weaker than this .",
    "we end this section by exploring the case of nmg theory in 3d .",
    "the action is given by ,    s = d^3x ( r+ + l^2(r_abr^ab - r^2 ) ) [ clag ] the critical point is now at @xmath179 for this case , = ( 1-+ l^2 f(r , v)- l^2 r(v ) f(r , v ) ) .",
    "the background solution is taken as , f(r)= f_(1-()^2 ) , where the quantity @xmath175 satisfies @xmath180 then we get the following bound , [ b7 ] .",
    "demanding the positivity of the black hole entropy we get , @xmath181 this gives , @xmath182 thus we have , -3 < . in this case , even if we consider a zero mass hyperbolic black hole we obtain the same bound .",
    "in this section we will construct a holographic @xmath183-function using the fps entropy functional for general curvature squared theories . here we will again use the evolution equation for @xmath61 ( [ ray3 ] ) and in the process we will have a geometric derivation for the @xmath183-function .    for unitary lorentz invariant theory one can define a function in the space of couplings which decreases monotonically from uv to ir , parametrizing the rg flow .",
    "it coincides with the central charges of the corresponding cfts at the uv and ir fixed point . in @xmath184 and @xmath185 dimensions",
    "this has been established rigorously @xcite .",
    "now from the holographic point view this @xmath183 function plays a pivotal role in understanding nature of rg flow . a proposal for the @xmath183 function for arbitrary theories of gravity has been given in @xcite for arbitrary dimensions . in this section",
    "we will use the raychaudhuri equation as discussed in the previous sections and derive a @xmath183 function for a general curvature squared theory . for general higher curvature theories",
    ", we do not expect a c - theorem as there are bound to be problems with unitarity in such theories .",
    "thus some condition on the couplings , which presumably only explore a subset of conditions leading to unitarty as in @xcite , is expected .",
    "this is what we will find as well . at the uv and ir fixed points",
    "this function will coincide with the a - type anomaly coefficient for the curvature squared theory and it will also have to be a monotonically decreasing quantity along the rg flow . to prove the monotonicity we will use raychaudhuri equation .",
    "the basic setup is similar as before .      to derive a @xmath183 function purely in terms of geometric quantities",
    "we will first start with a specific example",
    ". we will consider domain wall type of geometry in @xmath186 dimensions , the metric for which is given below , ds^2=dr^2+e^2",
    "a(r)(-d^2+dx^2+dy^2 + dz^2 ) .",
    "the spacetime can be foliated by surfaces of codimension-2 at every constant time slice .",
    "the induced metric on such surfaces is given by , ds^2_surface = e^2 a(r)(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 ) .",
    "next we will consider a hypersurface orthogonal null congruence .",
    "the tangent vector for this congruences is given by , k^a=(_)^a=\\{-e^-a(r),e^-2 a(r),0,0,0}. it satisfies @xmath187 and @xmath188 we can construct another auxiliary null vector @xmath16 as , l^a=\\{,,0,0,0 } such that , @xmath189 note that in this case @xmath17 and @xmath16 are not any kind of horizon null generators as compared to the previous sections .",
    "they simply correspond to a null congruence that converges along the light sheet projected out of the codimension-2 surface under consideration .",
    "also in this section we will use affine parametrization .",
    "next we will start with a guess for the @xmath183 function for curvature squared theory .",
    "the action for this theory is given by , s = d^4 x. the corresponding entropy functional is the fps functional .",
    "s_fps = d^3 x ( 1+)= d^3 x ( 1 + 2 ) .",
    "@xmath123 is the 3 dimensional ricci scalar intrinsic to the surface .",
    "now we will start with the following candidate , c()= where as usual , @xmath190 and @xmath191 is the affine parameter .",
    "this appears to be a natural guess since for the einstein theory it goes over to the c - function in @xcite .",
    "then we have to show two things ,    1 .",
    "@xmath192 is monotonically decreasing under the flow along the null geodesic congruences .",
    "that is we have to check the sign of @xmath193 2 .",
    "further it has to coincide with the correct central charge ( a - type anomaly in four dimensions ) at the fixed points .",
    "now , @xmath194 using @xmath195 next we will replace @xmath196 by ( [ ray2 ] ) with @xmath197 and @xmath198 by raychaudhuri equation ( [ ray1 ] ) .",
    "we obtain , = + e_kk , where , @xmath199 also , @xmath200 and c()=. notice that in ( [ dcdt ] ) the term proportional to @xmath201 has no possibility of having a definite sign and it does not cancel with terms in @xmath73 so it is natural to set the coefficient to zero",
    ". now @xmath202 is positive and @xmath65 using the null energy condition is positive . with @xmath203 , we find e_kk= ( - ) .",
    "where we have used @xmath204 so we will have now , = + ( - ) , then we can define a effective quantity , |c()= c()+ such that , = 0 , next evaluating @xmath205 and multiplying both side by a factor of @xmath206 we get , ( ) 0 . now in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath81 this becomes , ( k^r_r + k^ _ ) ( ) 0 . from this , e^-2 a(r ) ( ) 0 .",
    "so , @xmath207 is a monotonically decreasing quantity along the rg flow , where the rg scale is determined by the radial coordinate @xmath81 . at the fixed point",
    "the geometry is ads and hence @xmath208 the @xmath209 coincides ( upto an inconsequential overall factor ) with the a - type anomaly coefficient at uv and ir ( see eg .",
    "@xcite for expressions in general higher curvature theories ) . in this construction ,",
    "the starting point of the entropy functional played an important role in reaching the condition @xmath210 . in @xcite ,",
    "this condition emerged by demanding the existence of a  simple \" c - function .",
    "our analysis gives another way of looking at the same condition .",
    "one may wonder if it is possible to come up with a scenario where we did not need to absorb @xmath73 into the c - function like what we have done .",
    "for example , instead of the hee functional , perhaps one could try to construct a functional that cancels the @xmath73 on the _ rhs _ of the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "this does not appear to be the case  starting with the wald entropy functional instead of the hee functional does not naturally lead to the @xmath210 condition .",
    "in this paper , we considered four derivative gravity and subjected it to the condition that the second law of black hole thermodynamics is satisfied at linear and quadratic orders in perturbation .",
    "we showed that the entropy functional is uniquely fixed ( upto second order in extrinsic curvatures ) and coincides with the holographic entropy functionals .",
    "we also derived interesting bounds on the coupling which arises at next to leading order in perturbations .",
    "we conclude here with a brief discussion on possible future directions .",
    "* one should consider more generic perturbations to see what happens at linear and second order .",
    "this is important since the possibility exists that for generic perturbations the second law holds only for very specific cases like the lovelock theories . in @xcite",
    ", it was argued that causality constraints would require adding an infinite set of higher spin massive modes in a gb theory for consistency .",
    "it will be interesting to see if the second law knows about this in the perturbative sense used in the current work . * by considering asymptotically flat black holes and the gauss - bonnet theory , we found that for the negative gb coupling we get a minimum horizon radius for the second law to hold . taking this to be a pathology",
    ", this appears to disfavour this sign of the coupling .",
    "we further saw that the second law appears to know about the sound channel instablity in the context of gauss - bonnet holography .",
    "it will be interesting to see if @xmath211 which corresponds to the scalar channel instability @xcite can also be seen from the second law .",
    "* one should consider how our analysis will change if there is matter coupling to the higher curvature terms . in this case",
    ", it is not clear how to define the null energy condition .",
    "it seems natural that the matter couplings will get constrained by demanding the second law . *",
    "our analysis can be extended to general theories such as the quasi - topological theories @xcite . in order to get a sufficient number of conditions to fix all the extrinsic curvature terms , one will need to turn on generic perturbations . * in case of gravitational chern - simons terms , it will be interesting to see if and how the validity of second law can fix the entropy functionals @xcite . since the @xmath212 of the raychaudhuri equation does not know about topological terms , the linearized analysis will not be able to capture the effect of such terms .",
    "one may need to consider topology changing processes like black hole mergers @xcite to see the effect of such terms .",
    "* it will be interesting to compare our analysis with what arises from similar considerations in the fluid - gravity correspondence @xcite . demanding a positive entropy current for higher curvature theories will lead to constraints which are presumably going to be similar to what we have found .",
    "* the connection between the second law constraints and the positivity of relative entropy @xcite in the context of holography can also be explored .",
    "we found that when we consider the second law for topological black holes with zero mass , we recover the bound from the tensor channel causality constraint .",
    "why is this happening ?",
    "a plausible explanation is as follows .",
    "the topological black holes with zero mass are just ads spaces written in different co - ordinates and the finite wald entropy of these black holes can be interpreted as an entanglement entropy across a sphere @xcite in the dual field theory .",
    "thus the second law in this context may be related to the positivity of relative entropy due to a time dependent perturbation corresponding to the infalling matter we have considered .",
    "relative entropy is expected to be positive for a unitary field theory .",
    "hence there appears to be an interesting interplay between bulk causality and field theory unitarity",
    ". it will be interesting to make this connection more precise .",
    "it will also be interesting to understand the bounds in the context of c - theorems using the second law for causal horizons as advocated recently in @xcite .",

    "<S> for the five dimensional gauss - bonnet theory in the context of ads / cft , the bound arising from black branes coincides with there being no sound channel instability close to the horizon . repeating the analysis for topological black holes , the bound coincides with the tensor channel causality constraint ( which is responsible for the viscosity bound ) . </S>",
