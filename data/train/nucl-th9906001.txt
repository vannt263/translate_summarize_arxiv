    "with the advent of radioactive nuclear beams , the properties of nuclei beyond the proton stability line have attracted experimental and theoretical attention in recent years .",
    "special interest is devoted to a unique aspect originating from the fact that protons and neutrons occupy the same orbits in nuclei with @xmath6 ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "consequently , one expects a strong proton - neutron ( @xmath0 ) interaction because of the large spatial overlaps between proton and neutron single - particle wave functions .",
    "the correlation energies related to the @xmath0 interaction have been extracted from the experimental binding energies @xcite .",
    "a double difference of binding energies has been analyzed with the aim of providing input to semiempirical mass formulas @xcite , and with relation to the clustering of nucleons as elementary modes of excitation in nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has recently been used for study of the p - n interactions @xcite , and discussed in terms of schematic and realistic shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "this approach using the double difference of binding energies may provide details of the @xmath0 interactions , the isoscalar ( @xmath7 ) and isovector ( @xmath8 ) @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the @xmath0 part of the isovector pairing correlation near @xmath5 has been studied in terms of algebraic model @xcite and compared with shell model monte carlo calculations @xcite . on the other hand , there are many discussions of the roles of the isoscalar pairing interactions ( see refs.@xcite for instance ) .",
    "the experimental data indicate @xcite that the symmetry energy accompanied by the so - called wigner energy behaves according to the @xmath9 dependence ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this form could come from the isospin - invariant hamiltonian .",
    "it has been recently proposed that the wigner energy originates in the isoscalar pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the wigner energy can not be solely explained in terms of correlations between the @xmath11 isoscalar @xmath0 pairs , and the isoscalar @xmath0 pairs with the other @xmath4 contribute significantly @xcite .",
    "in fact , a recent shell model calculation @xcite with the @xmath12 isovector and @xmath11 isoscalar pairing forces in the @xmath6 @xmath13 shell nuclei can not explain the magnitude of the wigner energy .",
    "on the other hand , another paper @xcite has discussed the fact that the degeneracy of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 states in odd - odd nuclei with @xmath5 is produced by a balance of the symmetry energy and the @xmath12 isovector pairing correlation .",
    "the lowering of the @xmath14 states in @xmath5 odd - odd nuclei , according to our investigation @xcite , is caused by a unique form of isoscalar ( @xmath0 ) pairing force including all @xmath4 components .",
    "this result is consistent with that of satula et al .",
    "@xcite the uniqueisoscalar @xmath0 pairing force , which can be expressed in a simple form including the @xmath9 term , manifests a close relation to the symmetry energy . we shall discuss this matter by a concrete calculation in this paper .    the odd - even mass difference ( oemd ) , the extra binding energy of a nucleus relative to its neighbors ,",
    "is known to be an obvious experimental evidence of the pairing correlation @xcite .",
    "the pairing phenomena are well understood in terms of the proton - proton ( @xmath16 ) or neutron - neutron ( @xmath17 ) pair condensate , and described by the bardeen - cooper - schriefer(bcs ) theory @xcite .",
    "the oemd is often interpreted as a measure of the pairing gap ( following the relation @xmath18 on the average ) in medium - heavy and heavy nuclei .",
    "the oemd displays , however a different feature in @xmath6 nuclei such as a special increase at @xmath5 .",
    "an ordinary estimation of the neutron or proton pairing gap from the oemd is not applicable to these nuclei .",
    "on the other hand , it has recently been discussed that the oemd in light nuclei is affected by deformation as well as @xmath12 pairing correlation @xcite . a further investigation of the oemd should be made in @xmath6 nuclei .",
    "we shall discuss the influence of the @xmath0 interactions on the oemd .",
    "the development of recent radioactive nuclear beams facilities provides unstable nuclei beyond the line of proton stability .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations of proton emitters are increasing .",
    "such phenomena allow a test of the various models on the proton - rich side . for @xmath6 nuclei , one can expect that the @xmath0 interactions also influence the separation energy . since the @xmath0 force is considered to be attractive",
    ", it might increase the separation energy .",
    "in fact , the calculated separation energies by all models without the @xmath0 interaction are smaller than those of experiments at the @xmath5 nuclei .",
    "we need a reliable effective interaction to study the nuclear properties mentioned above .",
    "we have proposed an extension of the @xmath19 model with four forces @xcite , which reproduces quite well the experimental binding energies and energy spectra in @xmath6 nuclei of @xmath2 and @xmath3 subshells .",
    "this model interaction including different types of @xmath0 forces is very suitable for our purpose to study various aspects of the @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the @xmath0 interactions , analyzing the double differences of binding energies , and to check the validity of our model examining various quantities such as the symmetry energy , the wigner energy , the odd - even mass difference and the separation energy in nuclei near @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first review our model proposed in the previous paper . sec .",
    "iii contains the analysis of the double differences of binding energies to probe the @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the symmetry energy and the wigner energy are discussed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , the odd - even mass differences are analyzed in detail , and the two - proton separation energies are calculated in sec .",
    "vi . finally , sec .",
    "vii gives conclusions .",
    "we have proposed the following effective interaction extended from the @xmath19 force which is composed of four isospin - invariant forces ( see ref .",
    "@xcite in detail ) : @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22=@xmath23 and @xmath24=@xmath25=@xmath26 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the spin and isospin of a nucleon pair , respectively .",
    "the subscript @xmath29 denotes the @xmath30 components of isospin @xmath31 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath32 for a proton and @xmath33 for a neutron .    here",
    "@xmath34 is a single - particle hamiltonian and @xmath35 contains the four forces : @xmath36 stands for the isovector monopole pairing force , @xmath37 for the isoscalar quadrupole - quadrupole force , @xmath38 for the isovector quadrupole pairing force and @xmath39 for the @xmath4-independent isoscalar @xmath0 force .",
    "the first two forces in the interaction ( [ eq:8 ] ) are an extension of the conventional @xmath19 force to the isospin - invariant one .",
    "the p - n part of the monopole and quadrupole pairing forces as well as the @xmath0 component of the quadrupole - quadrupole force would be important for @xmath6 nuclei .",
    "the last @xmath0 force is very important for reproducing the experimental binding energy .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath39 can be expressed as a simple form @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the total number operator of valence nucleons ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is the total isospin operator .",
    "our @xmath0 interaction is composed of four different components and hence is useful in analyzing their respective contributions to various physical quantities .",
    "we applied the above hamiltonian to examine the binding energies and energy spectra of nuclei with @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "we adopted only the @xmath2 shell for nuclei with @xmath46=80 - 100 regarding the @xmath47 core as inactive , and the @xmath3 shell for nuclei with @xmath46=40 - 50 regarding the @xmath48 core as inactive .",
    "it may be necessary to extend these model spaces for quantitative discussion .",
    "our calculation itself indicates the insufficiency of the model space @xmath49 about energy spectra .",
    "we used an extended model space @xmath50 when comparing calculated energy levels with observed ones in nuclei with @xmath51 , while experimental data near @xmath52 seem to demand a further extension of the model space .",
    "the previous paper , however , has shown that the single @xmath53 shell model is bearable for semiquantitative discussion about the nuclear binding energy .",
    "this simple model makes it possible to clearly see the roles of respective @xmath0 interactions .",
    "we therefore employ the same single @xmath53 shell model as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the following force strengths are used : @xmath54 @xmath55 our model with these sets of parameters is considered to be reliable for studying the p - n interactions in connection with physical quantities related to the binding energy in the @xmath2 and @xmath56 shell nuclei .",
    "the mass dependence of the force parameter @xmath57 is taken into account in some cases , but it does not change qualitatively the result .",
    "we define the @xmath58th double difference of binding energies as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the nuclear binding energy . here",
    "the operator @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 .",
    "\\label{eq:102}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the double difference of binding energies , @xmath63 , was introduced for investigating the semiempirical mass formula @xcite .",
    "this quantity is expected to roughly represent the @xmath0 interactions between the last proton and neutron from the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:102 ] ) .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the plot of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath64 for nuclei in the mass region @xmath46=16 - 165 .",
    "experimental data are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "we see two separate groups in fig .",
    "1(a ) , namely , one is for the even-@xmath46 nuclei ( dots ) and the other is for the odd-@xmath46 nuclei ( crosses ) . in both cases , shell effects at @xmath65 or @xmath66 are present , while the patterns of dots and crosses are symmetric with respect to the average curve .",
    "it is now convenient to divide @xmath63 into two parts : the average part of the even-@xmath46 and odd-@xmath46 nuclei and the deviation from it . as seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the former is approximately written as @xmath67 and the latter has opposite signs for the even-@xmath46 and odd-@xmath46 nuclei as follows : @xmath68 this expression was originally given by de - shalit @xcite in the earliest investigations of the effective p - n interactions .",
    "equation ( [ eq:103 ] ) describes the staggering with respect to the isotopes for even-@xmath46 and odd-@xmath46 nuclei .",
    "large values of @xmath63 for even-@xmath46 nuclei ( dots ) near @xmath5 below @xmath52 are notable .",
    "the data of @xmath69 are plotted in fig .",
    "1(b ) as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "( our definition of @xmath70 has a sign opposite to that of brenner s @xmath71 @xcite . )",
    "the values of @xmath70 show a different behavior from @xmath72 .",
    "it is interesting that the staggering of @xmath72 disappears in @xmath69 .",
    "we see large scatters of dots and crosses for @xmath73 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath70 of nuclei in @xmath6 , and the values of @xmath70 at @xmath5 are especially large . with decreasing mass @xmath46 , @xmath70 at @xmath5 increases .",
    "if one neglects the dots and crosses in @xmath6 nuclei , @xmath70 varies rather smoothly .",
    "this smooth trend is clear for @xmath74 and continues up to heavy nuclei .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is no stable @xmath6 nuclei with @xmath75 .",
    "figure 1(b ) clearly indicates the smooth systematic decrease of @xmath70 with increasing mass @xmath46 , which can be traced by the curve @xmath76 .",
    "the deviations from the curve @xmath76 are small , and shell structure is not found .",
    "this general trend of @xmath70 has long been known , and was discussed in several papers . in a recent paper @xcite , the dramatic spikes of @xmath70 at @xmath5 light nuclei were discussed in terms of both schematic and realistic shell model calculations , and the importance of @xmath7 @xmath0 interaction for the spikes was pointed out .",
    "the following relationship is derived from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:101 ] ) and ( [ eq:102 ] ) : @xmath77 . \\label{eq:4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting the empirical relationship ( [ eq:103 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , in the large @xmath46 limit we get @xmath78 thus , the systematic behavior of @xmath69 for @xmath75 can be explained from the relation ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "( strictly speaking , there is a deviation from @xmath76 due to the mass dependence of @xmath79 . )",
    "furthermore , it is obtained that @xmath80 for @xmath81 have similar pattern to @xmath82 , and are also traced by the curve @xmath76 .    to analyze the double differences of binding energies , we now express the ground - state energy as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the expectation value with respect to the ground state .",
    "here , @xmath85 is the @xmath0 parts of the @xmath86 force , and @xmath87 is the proton - proton ( @xmath16 ) and neutron - neutron ( @xmath17 ) parts of the total interaction ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath88 and @xmath89 as a function of valence - neutron number @xmath90 for nb and mo isotopes .",
    "the @xmath0 part of the @xmath86 energy , @xmath88 , exhibits a characteristic odd - even staggering in nb isotopes , while @xmath89 gives a smooth line except for @xmath91 . on the other hand , for mo isotopes @xmath88",
    "varies smoothly as @xmath90 increases , and indicates very different structure from that of nb isotopes .",
    "this can be attributed to extra energy for the odd - odd nuclei , which mainly comes from the @xmath8 @xmath0 part of the @xmath86 force .",
    "consider the double difference of ground - state energies , @xmath92 , using the operator @xmath93 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:102 ] ) . since there are almost no contributions from the single particle energy @xmath94 and coulomb interaction to the double difference of binding energies as seen in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:102 ] ) , one notices that @xmath92 is able to be compared directly with the experimental value @xmath63 . figure 3 shows the calculated and experimental double differences of binding energies , @xmath92 and @xmath63 , as a function of mass @xmath64 for the nb , mo , tc , and pd isotopes .",
    "the nb and mo nuclei near @xmath5 at the beginning of @xmath2 shell region probably have the mixing of single particle levels , the @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "as seen from fig .",
    "3(a)-(d ) , however , the agreement with experiments is quite good .",
    "our calculation reproduces the staggering , and also predicts the highest spikes at @xmath5 nuclei though no experimental data are present .",
    "table i. the components of @xmath92 for the mo isotopes .",
    "the first and second columns denote the @xmath8 components , and the third and fourth columns the @xmath7 components .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to refs .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , the oemd in light nuclei is strongly affected by deformation originated in the jahn - teller mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see what interactions contribute to @xmath97 being the main part of @xmath98 .",
    "table iv presents the respective contributions of the @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 forces to @xmath97 in the cr isotopes .",
    "the dominant component is @xmath102 as expected , i.e. , about 2.0 mev for @xmath103 and about 1.2 mev for @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , there are considerably large contributions of @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "since the @xmath100 correlation is intimately related to the nuclear deformation , the positive contribution of @xmath105 is consistent with the conclusion of ref .",
    "the contribution of quadrupole pairing force @xmath101 , however , is negative , and is larger than that of the @xmath100 correlation for @xmath103 .",
    "this is easily understood by the fact that the quadrupole pairing correlation breaks the @xmath12 cooper pairs of neutrons .",
    "the present calculation tells us that the quadrupole pairing correlation probably cancels the effect of the @xmath100 correlation or the deformation on the oemd value @xcite .",
    "figure 10 shows calculated and experimental values of @xmath107 as a function of @xmath108 for the ca , ti , cr , and fe isotopes . the agreement with experiments is quite good except for the ti isotopes .",
    "the calculation reproduces the hill near @xmath5 and @xmath109 and also the gentle behavior of @xmath107 near the value 1.6 mev in the region of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the increase of @xmath107 at @xmath5 and @xmath112 is explained in terms of the same mechanism as that of @xmath113 at @xmath5 , which is caused by the coincident bends at @xmath5 of the two graphs in fig .",
    "9 that illustrate the variations of the @xmath0 interaction energies .",
    "the isovector p - n interactions of the @xmath114 force and the isoscalar @xmath0 force @xmath115 are important at @xmath5 also for @xmath107 .",
    "we have investigated several quantities related to the nuclear binding energy in the previous sections .",
    "the calculated data include binding energies of nuclei close to the proton drip line .",
    "it is interesting to look at the two - proton separation energy , experimental data of which has been accumulated by the radioactive beam .",
    "it provides the possibility for studying new decay modes such as diproton emission .",
    "some nuclei around @xmath116ni are expected to possibly be two - proton emitters .",
    "there is a large deviation between theory and experiment for the two - proton separation energy up to now .",
    "all the predictions by the hartree - fock ( bogoliubov ) and relativistic hartree - fock ( bogoliubov ) treatments @xcite underestimate the two - proton separation energies at @xmath5 nuclei .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the lack of p - n interactions in these treatments . as seen in the oemd in sec .",
    "v , the p - n correlations cooperate with the @xmath16 and @xmath17 correlations especially at @xmath5 nuclei .",
    "we can expect that the @xmath0 interactions have a considerable influence on the two - proton separation energy .",
    "we calculated the two - proton separation energies @xmath117 for the @xmath3 shell nuclei with @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in the calculation , the force strength @xmath120 is chosen as @xmath121 which was used in the previous paper @xcite , because the 1/a dependence of @xmath120 improves the binding energy and is also supported by the discussion in sec .",
    "iii . calculated values of @xmath117",
    "are compared with experimental data taken from ref .",
    "@xcite in fig . 11 .",
    "here we subtracted the coulomb energy following caurier @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the agreement is good .",
    "the observed values of @xmath122 are reproduced well at @xmath5 nuclei .",
    "again , the isoscalar @xmath0 force @xmath123 plays an important role in the two - proton separation energy at @xmath5 as well as in the other quantities discussed above .",
    "the model space @xmath49 and the set of parameters used are not appropriate for nuclei with large @xmath65 and @xmath124 , strictly speaking . according to the experience in this paper , however , the results on the _ different quantities of binding energies _ might be still meaningful .",
    "we note the prediction of our calculation that @xmath116ni , @xmath125co and @xmath126ni are possibly unstable , @xmath127ni is bound , and @xmath117 of @xmath128fe and @xmath116co are close to zero .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 interactions using the functional effective interaction with four force parameters which reproduces the energy levels and binding energies of @xmath6 nuclei considerably well .",
    "first , we analyzed the double differences of binding energies @xmath72 and @xmath70 , because the two quantities are expected to directly represent the @xmath0 interactions .",
    "our effective interaction reproduces fairly well the experimental values of @xmath72 and @xmath70 , and their characteristic behaviors , in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 shell nuclei .",
    "the staggering of @xmath72 is due to the competition between @xmath129 and @xmath130 components .",
    "the large spike of @xmath72 at @xmath5 is attributed to the @xmath129 @xmath0 interactions of the @xmath114 foce , and that of @xmath70 at @xmath5 contrarily represents the @xmath130 @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the observed values of @xmath70 with respect to mass @xmath46 are approximated by the curve @xmath76 .",
    "this curve may be explained by granting an @xmath46 dependence on the @xmath130 p - n force strength @xmath120 .",
    "second , our effective interaction has also reproduced well the symmetry energy and the wigner energy for the @xmath3 shell nuclei . the strong @xmath130 @xmath0 force @xmath115 with assistance of the @xmath129",
    ", @xmath12 pairing force is important to explain the magnitudes of the two quantities in this region .",
    "it should be noted that the isospin parts of the two forces are proportional to @xmath9 and their sum is directly related to the symmetry energy in the mass .",
    "the @xmath46 dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient seems to be determined mainly by that of @xmath120 .",
    "third , our effective interaction has described well the observed values of the odd - even mass difference ( @xmath98 and @xmath131 ) for the @xmath3 shell nuclei .",
    "the cooperation of the @xmath0 interactions with the like - nucleon interactions is remarkable at @xmath5 .",
    "it causes the rise of @xmath98 and @xmath131 at @xmath5 .",
    "the characteristic behaviors of the @xmath0 interaction energies at @xmath5 ( see fig . 9 ) have an important effect not only on the double differences of binding energies but in the odd - even mass difference .",
    "we have briefly touched on the two - proton separation energy @xmath117 using the calculated binding energies .",
    "the calculation indicates a considerably large effect of the @xmath0 force on @xmath117 at @xmath5 .",
    "we noted the prediction of our calculation for @xmath117 near the @xmath3 proton drip line .",
    "the present investigations have shown that the @xmath0 interactions cause the notable behaviors of the observed quantities related to the binding energy near @xmath5 in nuclei where valence protons and neutrons occupy the same shells .",
    "furthermore , our calculations suggest that the @xmath0 interactions ( especially @xmath132 ) are important for describing these quantities over a wide range of @xmath133 nuclei including the neutron drip line .",
    "all the results support the usefulness of the functional effective interaction composed of the four forces @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath115 , and clarify the essential roles of @xmath115 in the physical quantities related to the binding energy .",
    "the present calculations , however , have been carried out in the single @xmath53 shell model .",
    "calculations in more realistic model spaces are in progress .",
