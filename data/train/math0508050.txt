    "in this paper we consider groups of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the circle , acting in the natural way , and give a complete categorization of the topological possibilities for orbits of points of the circle under the action of the group .",
    "this is an extension of sacksteder s theorem ( @xcite , p. 20 ) , which gives three possible orbit types , but does not describe the remaining possibilities . in particular , if there is a finite orbit set , it does not describe the structure of the remaining orbits .    in section  [ sec : prelim ] we will review the poincar classification of orbits for circle homeomorphisms , and recall sacksteder s theorem for groups of homeomorphisms .",
    "the intent of this paper is to refine sacksteder s theorem in the case that the action of the group has a finite orbit .    in section  [ sec : groups ]",
    "we will prove the following :    let @xmath0 be a group of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the interval @xmath1 $ ] and suppose @xmath0 satisfies one of the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 is finitely generated and there are no fixed points of the group in @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   there exists at least one group element @xmath3 of @xmath0 whose fixed points do not accumulate at either 0 or 1 .",
    "then every nonempty @xmath0-invariant set that is closed with respect to @xmath4 contains a nonempty , @xmath0-invariant set closed in @xmath2 and minimal under those properties .",
    "we will assume throughout the rest of the paper that the group @xmath0 of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the circle has a finite number of finite orbit points , which we denote @xmath5 .",
    "we will split the circle at points of @xmath5 and look at the complementary subintervals , which we call @xmath6 .",
    "if the finite orbits points in @xmath5 are all fixed under the group , then the orbit of any point will be entirely contained in one @xmath6 ; if not , it will be contained in the union of some number of the @xmath6 .",
    "we call the union of the intervals which the orbit of @xmath7 intersects nontrivially @xmath8 , for _ range _ of @xmath7 .",
    "we assume the group @xmath0 , restricted to one @xmath6 , satisfies one of the conditions of the lemma .",
    "we then prove the following :    for all @xmath9 , there are four possibilities for the orbit of @xmath7 :    1 .",
    "@xmath10 is dense in @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   @xmath10 accumulates exactly at points of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath10 is contained in a @xmath0-invariant cantor set in @xmath11 .",
    "the orbit of @xmath7 is dense in the cantor set , and the cantor set is contained in the closure of the orbit of each point of @xmath8 .",
    "4 .   @xmath12 contains a proper subset which is @xmath0-invariant , closed with respect to @xmath13 , and which does not intersect @xmath10 ; i.e. , @xmath10 accumulates at the closure of another orbit .    in section  [ sec : examples ] we will give a collection of examples to demonstrate the four cases of the theorem .",
    "in particular , we will give two different examples that have a cantor set , and we will look at several examples designed to explore the different topological possibilites of a point in case 4 . this will lead us to define the _ level _ of an orbit ( see [ sec : leveln ] ) , so that we can describe the nesting of orbits that may occur in this case .    in section  [ sec : semigroups ] we will consider semigroups rather than groups , and give an example which demonstrates one way in which the orbit type under a semigroup can differ from those for groups .    section  [ sec : case4 ] is devoted to a closer examination of case 4 , the case in the theorem that admits the most complexity of orbits .",
    "we will prove a collection of lemmas whose purpose is to reduce the number of considerations necessary to understand the range of possibilities , and we will define a few of the special orbit types that may arise .    in section  [ sec : analytic ] we will prove results for points in the fourth case when the group homeomorphisms are analytic .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : qsandconjs ] we will conclude with some conjectures for future work .",
    "the classical theory of dynamical systems studies the orbit structure of a homeomorphism or a flow on a manifold , in particular , the topological properties of @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to studying actions of the group @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "one can ask under what circumstances a map will have periodic points , dense orbits , etc .",
    "one can also study the actions of more general groups . in this paper",
    "we will look at the orbit structure of a group of homeomorphisms acting in a natural way on the circle .",
    "poincar classified the possible behavior of orbits for a given homeomorphism of the circle by looking at the rotation number of the homeomorphism , an invariant that gives the `` average '' rotation under the map .",
    "for a more thourough discussion of these concepts , see @xcite , chapter 11 .",
    "he showed that points of @xmath18 can have six different kinds of orbits under homeomorphisms : three types each for rational and irrational rotation numbers .",
    "the possibilities are : a periodic orbit , a homoclinic orbit approaching a given periodic orbit , a heteroclinic orbit approaching two different periodic orbits , a dense orbit , an orbit dense in a cantor set , and an orbit homoclinic to a cantor set .",
    "when studying the action of a group of homeomorphisms , we discuss the _ group orbit _ of a point @xmath7 , denoted @xmath19 .",
    "we often refer to this as the _ orbit _ of the point without making reference to the group .",
    "this is not to be confused with the orbit of a point under a single map ( generally a `` smaller '' set ) .",
    "sacksteder s theorem describes the main possibilities for the dynamics of an arbitrary group of homeomorphisms .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion and proof .",
    "let @xmath0 be any subgroup of @xmath20 , the orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the circle .",
    "there are three mutually exclusive possibilities :    1 .",
    "there is a finite orbit .",
    "2 .   all orbits are dense .",
    "3 .   there is a compact @xmath0-invariant subset @xmath21 which is infinite and different from @xmath18 and such that the orbits of points in @xmath22 are dense in @xmath22 .",
    "this set @xmath22 is unique , contained in the closure of any orbit , and is homeomorphic to a cantor set .",
    "the three options are directly related to the types of invariant minimal sets which can exist for homeomorphisms of the circle .",
    "it is known that the circle supports three different types of invariant minimal sets under the action of a homeomorphism : finite sets , cantor sets , and the circle itself . as",
    "the orbit of a point under a homeomorphism is automatically invariant under that map , it is easy to see how the results of the classification theorems reflect those options .",
    "unsurprisingly , the proof of this theorem relies heavily on the ability to find a minimal set which is compact and invariant under the action of the group .",
    "we are interested in extending the result when there is a known finite orbit , in order to understand the behavior of all the nonfinite orbits in this case .",
    "we will also need to find a minimal set ; however , it will take some extra work .",

    "[ thm : main ] , we can apply minimality arguments to conclude that @xmath10 must fall into one of the four cases .",

    "let @xmath112 be the level @xmath446 orbit on which @xmath10 accumulates .",
    "since @xmath10 has integer type , @xmath112 must have integer or cantor set type . in either case , let @xmath114 be the collection of complementary intervals , such that @xmath447 . since @xmath7 has level @xmath331 integer type , we can further divide @xmath138 into subintervals complementary to the orbit of @xmath7 , which we call @xmath448 .",
    "consider the subgroup @xmath449 .",
    "@xmath450 is clearly nontrivial as @xmath10 intersects @xmath138 in an infinite number of points .",

    "proof : _",
    "suppose @xmath10 were cantor set type .",
    "let @xmath114 be the collection of intervals complementary to the cantor set , and say @xmath455 is the left endpoint of the interval @xmath138 . consider @xmath456 .",
    "the orbit of @xmath457 is dense in the cantor set , so if @xmath458 is the left endpoint of @xmath114 , there must be a sequence of maps @xmath459 such that @xmath460 , and @xmath138 is mapped to the corresponding intervals @xmath461 .",

    "however , @xmath256 is analytic in @xmath81 , and @xmath458 is interior to @xmath81 .",
    "this is a contradiction . so @xmath10 must not be cantor set type . therefore ,",

    ". it can not be level 3 , by theorem  [ thm : analytic ] .",
    "we would like to be able to make a definitive statement about the overall structure of orbits of points in case 4 .",
    "it seems that the natural thing to expect is that orbits in cases 1 , 2 , or 3 `` nest '' at increasing levels , such that the orbit of a level @xmath48 point @xmath7 can be understood by first looking at a single interval , broken down into subintervals bounded by consecutive parallel orbits , such that in each section the orbit will be dense , integer type , or contained in a cantor set .",
    "that picture will then be repeated a countable number of times at each level . however , in order to conclude this , we must better understand the structure of the subgroups that preserve subintervals at a given level .",
    "it seems likely that some amount of additional smoothness of the generators will enable us to apply the crucial lemma to the subgroups .",
    "we expect that we need something stronger than continuity , but that it is not necessary to require as much as analyticity :    if @xmath0 is a group generated by @xmath468 homeomorphisms , orbits of points in case 4 will consist of a countable number of copies of an interval @xmath81 , the union of a number of subintervals @xmath161 , in each of which the orbit is dense , has integer type , or is contained in a cantor set .    without knowing exactly how much smoothness is required , it would be interesting to see an example of a group of homeomorphisms with a level 1 integer type orbit where the subgroup @xmath421 that preserves the subintervals does not satisfy either condition in lemma  [ lemma : zorn ] .",
    "one imagines that the generating homeomorphisms of such a group would be quite complicated , either individually or in their interaction .",
    "there are also natural questions about the effect of the group structure on the possible orbits .",
    "we saw that the addition of abelian to the analytic case greatly restricted the possibilities .",
    "in particular , if the group is abelian , it may simplify the complications created by an orbit accumulating along a cantor set .",
    "what effect might abelian have on a group of less smooth homeomorphisms ?",
    "what about other group structure restrictions ?",
    "this issue is partially addressed in @xcite .    finally , in the case of semigroups ,",
    "although the structures can clearly be different , there is probably a similar description for orbits which takes into account any sections of the circle where all maps move points in the same direction ."
