    "analogue models of general relativity have long ago been considered in the literature .",
    "this theme was introduced by gordon in 1923 @xcite when an effective geometric interpretation for light propagation in homogeneous dielectrics was proposed . in the following six decades few works on this theme",
    "were published ( for a review , see refs .",
    "however , this research area was warmed up in the 80 s with the proposal of a hydrodynamic analogue model of a black hole by unruh @xcite . since then , lot of other models were proposed and their consequences investigated . for a review , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the main expectation is that some tiny effects predicted to occur in the realm of semiclassical gravity could be tested in such analogous to general relativity systems .",
    "of particular interest is the issue of hawking radiation , which is expected to occur whenever an event horizon is brought forth in a physical system , although some authors have different opinion @xcite .",
    "such effect was unveiled by hawking in 1975 @xcite as a result of the quantization of fields in the spacetime of a black hole .",
    "this issue was recently examined in laboratory by means of optic @xcite and hydrodynamic @xcite gravitational analogue systems . in both cases hawking - like radiation was reported to occur .    in the context of electrodynamics the most simple analogue model describing the propagation of light in a continuum media arises by considering constant dielectric coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 , here called electric permittivity and magnetic permeability , respectively . in such case",
    ", it can be shown that the paths of light are geodesic in an effective geometry given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the minkowski metric and @xmath4 is the observer s geodesic four - velocity ( assumed to be normalized to unity by simplicity ) with respect to which the material medium is at rest .",
    "the above metric is known as the gordon metric @xcite .",
    "more general results can be obtained by relaxing the constance of the dielectric coefficients . in this case",
    "several models describing different solutions of general relativity were obtained .",
    "for instance , almost axially symmetric optical analogues of schwarzschild black holes are already known @xcite .",
    "for these models , the occurrence of an event horizon is fundamentally dependent upon the vortical motion of the dielectric fluid .",
    "a model that does not involve mechanical motion of the medium was already presented @xcite in the context of metamaterials , where an effective black hole solution was proposed . in this paper",
    ", we investigate further the possibility of producing a material medium at rest with specific dielectric properties in such way that an exact analogue model for schwarzschild geometry becomes available .",
    "particularly , the behavior of light rays propagating in this medium is studied .",
    "we focus on the theoretical aspects of the phenomenon .",
    "experimental verification is already known in some tailored media @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ gordon ] , basic aspects of light propagation",
    "is reviewed , including the derivation of the dispersion relations for nonlinear material media and the corresponding effective optical metric interpretation .",
    "an optical model is presented in sec .",
    "[ analogue ] .",

    "let @xmath4 be the observer s geodesic four - velocity ( assumed to be normalized to unity for simplicity ) , with respect to which the material medium is at rest .",
    "maxwell equations inside this medium in minkowski space - time can be written in covariant notation as @xmath9 ( { } ^*f)^{\\alpha\\beta}{}_{;\\beta}=0,\\label{max_diel2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 stands for the dual of the maxwell field strength tensor @xmath11 , while the faraday tensor @xmath12 describes the field excitations .",
    "we assume that the permittivity parameter @xmath13 may be dependent upon the magnitude of the electric field strength @xmath14 , while the permeability parameter is momentarily being taken as the vacuum constant @xmath15 .",

    ". therefore , @xmath32 diverges at the horizon but remains finite everywhere else , while both @xmath88 and @xmath48 are finite at the horizon but they both diverge at the center ( except for @xmath89 , which gives @xmath90 everywhere ) .",
    "the inner solution should then be regularized near the center . our definite proposal to a spherically symmetric black hole analogue with radius @xmath57",
    "is thus built with a medium whose permittivity is such that @xmath91 when expressed in terms of the radial coordinate @xmath92 , then eq .  ( [ eps(r ) ] ) gives @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .",

    "( [ epsilon ] ) for @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath114 where @xmath58 is the same radial function considered above in eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ v+ ] ) states that the _ ordinary _ mode @xmath115 also can not propagate across the surface @xmath113 .",

    ", we see that the proposed dielectric media can reproduce in laboratory all the classical behavior of optical null geodesics near a compact object with a gravitational schwarzschild radius equal to @xmath57 .",
    "suppose a static spherically symmetric dielectric medium with electric charge density @xmath48 given by eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) , while its dielectric parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are real quantities ( that is , with no ` by - hand ' absorption ) which behave non - linearly according with eqs .",

    "maxwell equations then yield no magnetic field and a radial electric field given by eq .",

    "small electromagnetic field disturbances propagate as two linearly polarized wave modes .",
    "the extraordinary one amongst these two modes behaves exactly as a null wave of the black hole analogue geometry eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) .",
    "the ordinary mode propagates differently , but in such a way as to avoid propagation across the same analogue event horizon .",
    "thus , no electromagnetic field disturbance can propagate from the inner region of the analogue black hole to the region outside from it .",
    "as well known , quantization of fields on the classical schwarzschild spacetime ( semiclassical gravity ) leads to the concept of hawking radiation phenomenon . in terms of the surface gravity @xmath130 ,",
    "the planckian spectrum associated with such radiation defines the temperature @xmath131 . for the case of astrophysical candidates of black - holes",
    "the magnitude of this temperature is too small to be experimentally probed .",
    "analogue models of the schwarzschild solution could thus provide a useful arena to investigate hawking radiation .",

    "however , a proper demonstration of the existence of this phenomenon requires the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the nonlinear media described by the dielectric coefficients here proposed .",
    "this is an issue that deserves a careful analysis .    as an apparently simpler alternative to eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) , the choice @xmath15 could also be worked out as well , yielding @xmath133 .",
    "for such a case , however , the background electric field would vanish at horizon @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the small magnitude of the electric field of the wave could not be neglected in eq .",
    "( [ opt_up ] ) when compared to the background electric field .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( [ opt_up ] ) would not be an effective geometry very near the horizon , but it would instead depend as well on the field of the propagating wave there .",
    "that is to say , the analogue event horizon would become rather blurred and undefined in such simple case .",
    "other choices of the form @xmath134 with arbitrary constant @xmath135 yield qualitatively similar results as the ones presented in the preceding sections for @xmath136 , or those mentioned in the previous paragraph for @xmath137 ; such a class includes the proportionality condition @xcite between @xmath0 and @xmath1 claimed to be required in order to give room for the optical equivalence beyond the geometrical limit . other alternative choices",
