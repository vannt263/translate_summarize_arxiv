    "when planets are discovered through monitoring programs similar to those presently being carried out , the distance to the lens will typically be on the order of kiloparsecs .",
    "although some follow - up may be possible ( distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998 , distefano  1998a , b ) , imaging , such as that planned to probe possible companions to nearby stars ( stahl & sandler 1995 ; bender & stebbins 1996 ; labeyrie 1996 ; angel & woolf 1997 ) will not be possible in the near future",
    ". nevertheless , planets discovered as microlenses can play an important role in developing our understanding of planetary systems in our galaxy and beyond .",
    "the reason for this is precisely because microlensing observations probe vast volumes of the milky way and other galaxies , such as the magellanic clouds and m31 .",
    "thus , microlensing provides a unique window for studying the statistics of planetary systems ( numbers and properties ) and their dependence on the local stellar environment .",
    "microlensing searches complement velocity - based searches in another way as well . particularly for the wide systems studied here for the first time",
    ", the microlensing searches can be effective for low - mass planets orbiting at low speeds ; such planets can not readily be detected via radial velocity methods .    the framework for the work to date on discovering planets through microlensingwas established by mao & paczyski ( 1991 ) and gould & loeb ( 1992 ) .",
    "these authors found that when the separation , @xmath0 , between the star and planet  is close to the einstein radius , @xmath4 of the star ( @xmath5 ) , a significant fraction of events ( @xmath6 ) in which the star serves as a lens would be perturbed in a detectable way .",
    "this has been referred to as  resonant \" lensing , both because the separation must be close to @xmath7 in order for the signal to be detectable , and because the signal itself is sharp and distinctive .",
    "the detection strategy is to monitor light from an ongoing event at frequent intervals in order to observe a short - lived perturbation . with the analysis of more than @xmath8 microlensing  events reported to date , it is not clear whether any planetary - lens events have been discovered . , which is large enough to be consistent with lensing by a binary stellar system .",
    "second , the degeneracy of the physical solution has not yet been worked out .",
    "the degeneracy may be of two types : ( a )  other binary solutions with values of @xmath3 differing from the one for this fit by as much as an order of magnitude may prove to be equally good fits ( di stefano & perna 1996 ) ; this needs to be systematically checked .",
    "( b )  other physical effects may prove to be important , making the determination of the system s true parameters even more difficult .",
    "these effects include finite source size effects ( witt & mao 1994 ; witt 1995 ) , finite lens - size effects ( bromley 1996 ) , and blending ( distefano  & esin 1995 , kamionkowski 1995 ) .",
    "( in fact blending has been a feature of every other binary - lens event ; udalski _ et al .",

    "_ 1997a , bennett _ et al .",
    "_ 1996b . ) ] the purpose of this paper and its companion ( distefano & scalzo 1998 )  is to develop a complementary framework for the discovery of planets by microlensing .",
    "the basic idea is that planets located more than @xmath1 from the central star can give rise to characteristic microlensing  signatures that reveal evidence of their presence .",
    "the advantages of searching for planets in s are that there are likely to be be several such planets for every planet  that can give rise to a resonant event , and the probability of detection is not decreased in the same way , and can even be increased , by finite - source - size effects .",
    "we will say that planetary orbits in which the separation between the star and planet is larger than roughly 1.5 @xmath7 are  wide \" .",
    "( see  2.3 . )",
    "there are two types of events that provide evidence for the presence of planets in s. the first are isolated short - duration  events due to the passage of the track of a distant star through the einstein ring  ( or lensing region ) of an intervening planet .",
    "the second are repeating events , in which the track of an individual lensed source passes through the lensing regions of more than one mass in the ps . . among repeating events , the probability is largest that the track of the source will pass through the lensing regions of the central star  and one planet , but it can also pass through the rings of several planets .",
    "this paper focuses on isolated  events ; the companion paper ( distefano  & scalzo 1998 ) concentrates on repeating events .",
    " 2 lays the foundation for important parts of both papers . although comprehensive introductions to microlensing  can be found elsewhere ( see , e.g. , paczynki 1996 ) ,  2 includes a brief general introduction to microlensing , as well as some material specific to the case of lensing by planets in wide orbits .",
    "of particular importance are ( 1 ) the notion of the width of the lensing region , and ( 2 ) the role played by finite - source - size effects  in the detection  of planets in s. in  3 we address the question of whether planets in s are likely to exist and to serve as lenses .",
    "event rates , and detectability issues are the subjects of  4 . in  5 we discuss the detection strategies that can optimize the discovery of isolated short - duration  events and",
    "test the hypothesis that they are due to lensing by planets ; we focus on methods that involve modifications of existing observing programs .",
    "we sketch our conclusions in  6 .",
    "consider light traveling from a star located a distance @xmath9 from us .",
    "if there is an intervening mass , @xmath10 located a distance @xmath11 from us , gravity will deflect the light from the path it would otherwise have taken .",
    "the deflection leads to multiple and generally distorted images of the source .",
    "when @xmath9 is on the order of tens of kpc and the lens is a solar - mass star , the maximum image separations are on the order of milliarcseconds , and are generally not resolvable .",
    "changes in the amount of light received can be measured however , and these are also associated with lensing .",
    "the changes in flux are due to the motion of the source relative to the lens along the direction transverse to our line of sight .",
    "let @xmath12 represent the instantaneous distance between the source and the lens , as projected onto the lens plane .",
    "the instantaneous value of the magnification , @xmath13 is    @xmath14    the magnification itself is due to the fact that , although the surface brightness of the source is not affected by gravitational lensing , the total surface area of the images does change as the projected position of the source moves closer to and farther away from the lens . in the above equation",
    ", @xmath12 is measured in units of the einstein radius , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath15^{{1}\\over{2}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    "the magnification is equal to @xmath18 this magnification is measurable ; indeed , the einstein radius is often used as a measure of the width of the lensing region , for a solar - mass lens , with @xmath19 kpc and @xmath20 @xmath21 au .    in this paper and its companion ( distefano  & scalzo 1998 )",
    ", we will often set @xmath9 to 10 kpc and @xmath22 to 0.9 .",
    "this roughly corresponds to lensing by a star or ps .  in the galactic bulge of light from a more distant bulge star .",
    "will typically be smaller , and the size of stellar and planetary einstein rings will not differ substantially from the values we compute with @xmath23 kpc and @xmath24 . ] because the greatest number of events have been discovered along the direction to the bulge , and because many of these may in fact be events in which a bulge star lenses light from a more distant bulge star , these choices of the parameters may be the ones most relevant for the near - term discovery of planets via microlensing .",
    "the effects of other parameter choices can be gauged from eq .",
    "2 . in general , making @xmath9 larger , or choosing @xmath22 closer to @xmath25 ( the value that maximizes the size of the einstein ring  for given choices of @xmath26 and @xmath9 ) , will increase the size of the einstein radius , and will require planets to be located farther from the central star  in order to be in  wide orbits \" (  2.3 ) .    a measure of the event  is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the transverse velocity between source and lens .",
    "( see , e.g. , figure 6 . )",
    "if @xmath29 km / s , the event duration would be @xmath30 days , if the lens is of solar mass .",
    "if the lens is a jupiter - mass ( earth - mass ) planet , then the event  duration would be @xmath31 days ( @xmath32 hours ) .",
    "clearly the short duration of events in which low - mass objects serve as lenses poses a challenge to the detection of planets via microlensing .",
    "we note , however , that when finite - source - size effects  play a role , the relevant crossing time is more closely related to the time taken for the track of the source to move through a distance equal to the size of the source .",
    "if @xmath33 and @xmath34 km / s , @xmath35 hours .      the strategy for planet  discovery suggested by mao & paczyski ( 1991 ) and gould & loeb ( 1992 ) relies on observing an event  due to lensing by the ps .",
    "s star , and detecting perturbations from the form given by eq ( 1 ) .",
    "although the time scale for the stellar - lens event  may be on the order of months , the perturbations due to planets are short - lived , lasting for times on the order of hours .",
    "the perturbations are due to the passage of the track of the source through or very near to the caustic structure associated with the presence of the planet .",
    "if the lensed source is point - like , then there is an infinite jump in the magnification  as it passes through a caustic curve .",
    "finite - source - size effects moderate the magnitude and characteristics of the change .",
    "caustics are a feature associated with lens multiplicity .",
    "the case of a planet  orbiting a star can be thought of as a binary system with an extreme mass ratio ; generally we expect @xmath36 to be less than @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "because the mass of the planet  is small , the caustic structures around the stellar position are small ; this is why the perturbations of the stellar - lens light curve  tend to be short - lived .",
    "we will use the phrase ",
    "zone for resonant lensing \" to refer to the region ( @xmath39 ) in which caustic crossing events are most likely to occur .",
    "the spatial extent of the zone for resonant lensing  was discussed by paczyski ( 1996 ) and has been studied most recently by wambsganss ( 1997 ) .",
    "our results on detecting planets in s do not rely heavily on the exact position of its inner boundary , @xmath40 .",
    "as presently implemented , the search for resonant planets is carried out in two steps .",
    "first , the monitoring teams ( e.g. , eros , macho , ogle ) identify microlensing  eventcandidates .",
    "they do this by monitoring the flux from @xmath41 ) stars regularly .",
    "some of the monitored fields are not visited every night ; others are the targets of regular nightly monitoring and may occasionally be re - visited even within a single night .",
    "if the monitoring teams discover that an otherwise non - variable star s flux has increased significantly above baseline in several consecutive measurements , they typically issue an alert so that other observers can monitor the star more frequently .",
    "follow - up teams have been formed to take systematic advantage of this opportunity ( udalski et al .",
    "1994 ; pratt et al . 1995 ; albrow et al .",
    "1996 ) . under favorable conditions ,",
    "the follow - up teams carry out hourly monitoring with good photometry ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "although no promising candidates for events displaying clear signs of a planet  lens have yet emerged from the data sets , there may be several reasons for this .",
    "for example , the detection efficiency may be low enough that a larger number of events need to be monitored in order to have a good chance of detecting a resonant event .",
    "it might also be that planets with the appropriate distance from the central star are not common .",
    "in addition , finite - source - size effects can wash out the signature of the short - time - scale perturbations characteristic of planetary mass ratios , decreasing the number of detectable events ( bennett & rhie 1996 ) .",
    "the idea that the term  wide orbit \" is meant to capture is that , as the orbital separation between the planet  and the central star  increases , caustic crossing  events become less likely , while events in which a planet  acts as an independent lens become more common .",
    "these latter are characteristic of planet - lens events , when the planet  is in a .",
    "if the track of the source passes through the einstein ring of a single planet , we may discover an isolated event  of short - duration . if the track of the lensed star passes through the einstein rings of several masses in the ps .",
    ", then we may hope to discover a repeating event . although we have used the phrase  einstein ring \" , we note that , if the monitoring teams employ sensitive photometry , they can detect events in which the distance of closest approach to the lens is larger than an einstein radius .",
    "it is therefore useful to introduce the notion of the  lensing region \" : the region around the lens in the lens plane through which the source track must pass in order for a _",
    "detectable _ eventto occur .",
    "we will say that a planet is in a  wide \" orbit if its distance from the central star is large enough that the isomagnification contour associated with @xmath43 is comprised of two separated , closed curves , one centered near the star and the other centered near the planet . for mass ratios ranging from @xmath44 to @xmath38 ,",
    "the critical orbital radius , @xmath40 , beyond which an orbit becomes wide is roughly equal to @xmath45 .",
    "the choice of boundary , @xmath46 is of course somewhat arbitrary . were the exact value of @xmath40 important , then its dependence on the mass ratio would need to be taken into account .",
    "in fact , however , its exact value makes little difference to results on wide - orbit planets ; these would be roughly the same had we chosen @xmath47 or @xmath48 , the effect of increasing orbital separation near the boundaries of the zone for resonant lensing  has been studied in detail by wambsganss ( 1997 ) , and readers are referred there for a detailed discussion and instructive graphics .",
    "consider a lens of mass @xmath49 .",
    "as mentioned above , the lensing region associated with this mass is that region in the lens plane through which the track of the source must pass in order for an _",
    "observable _ event  to occur .",
    "if the region for lensing by a particular star or planet  is a disk , as it very nearly is when the planets are in s , the width , @xmath50 of the lensing region can be taken to be the radius of the lensing disk . because the size of the lensing region  relative to the einstein ringis important , it is convenient to define @xmath51 @xmath52 is the maximum impact parameter for an _",
    "observable _ event , expressed in units of the einstein radius . note that @xmath52 is not generally an integer .",
    "large values of @xmath53 facilitate planet  detection in two ways .",
    "first , the eventprobability is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "second , the larger the value of @xmath50 the longer typical events will be observable , and the better our chances of eventdetection .",
    "the value of @xmath53 can be made larger in two ways .",
    "the first is simply to increase the photometric sensitivity of the monitoring  programs .",
    "let @xmath54 represent the minimum value of the peak magnification  for which an event  can be reliably detected . if @xmath55,$ ] then @xmath56.$ ] has the same value , @xmath57 , for all lenses .",
    "since , however , the role played by finite - source - size effectsis specific to the lens , the value of @xmath52 _ can _ be lens - specific . ]",
    "the general formula for @xmath57 in terms of @xmath58 is @xmath59^{{1}\\over{2}}.\\ ] ]    the macho team has been driven to use a higher value of @xmath54 ( @xmath60 ) in order to eliminate the possibility that some forms of stellar variability may mistakenly be identified as microlensing(see , e.g. , purdue _ et al .",
    "as the star fields studied by the observing teams are monitored over longer times , however , unrecognizable stellar variability will become less of a potential problem , and the monitoring  teams should be able to lower their values for @xmath61 the photometric sensitivity of the follow - up teams is such that , were they to attempt to identify new events in the fields where they are monitoring  ongoing events , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) could be achieved .",
    "the second way in which @xmath53 can be increased is if the size of the lensed star , as projected onto the lens plane , is comparable to or slightly larger than the size of the einstein ring .",
    "although , finite source size tends to decrease the value of the peak magnification , it can also increase the size of the lensing region , since some parts of the source may be near enough to the lens position to experience significant magnification , even when the center of the source is farther away than a point source would have to be in order to experience the same overall enhancement of flux .",
    "our primary interest is in the detection of isolated events of short - duration .",
    "thus , our definition of event  must be keyed to the amount of time during which there is a deviation from the baseline flux that would be discernible , given a particular level of photometric sensitivity .",
    "if events can be reliably detected when the peak magnification  is @xmath58 then their start can certainly be detected before the magnification  is @xmath58 and they can continue to be monitored after the magnification  has fallen below @xmath61 in order to be conservative about the possibility of event  discovery and detection , we will say that an event  starts when the magnificationrises above @xmath54 , and ends when the magnification  falls below @xmath61 thus , the value of @xmath54 determines the width , @xmath50 of the lensing region .",
    "@xmath53 in turn plays a key role in setting the time , @xmath64 during which an event  is observable .",
    "we have @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the distance of closest approach .",
    "this definition of the event  is directly related to the time during which the event  can actually be monitored .",
    "it also makes it clear that any innovations that improve the photometric sensitivity of the observing programs may be important in increasing the observable  of planet - lens events , thus increasing the chances that such events will be discovered and studied .",
    "when we present the results of our simulations , we will take @xmath67      because the einstein radius scales as the square root of the lens mass , the einstein radii of planet - mass lenses can be comparable to the projected radius of the source star . with @xmath19 kpc and @xmath20 @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) for a jupiter - mass ( earth - mass ) lens . when the size of the source becomes a significant fraction of the size of the einstein ring ,",
    "finite - source - size effects  become important , and the magnification  is not well described by the formula of eq .  1 .",
    "there are two important effects .",
    "first , the peak of the light curve  becomes attenuated .",
    "the larger the source size relative to the einstein ring , the more pronounced the attenuation .",
    "the maximum magnification possible for a disk of constant surface brightness , for example , is ( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) @xmath70 this formula indicates that the size of the source must be fairly large in order for the peak magnification  to be brought below the level of detectability , particularly if the photometric sensitivity is good .",
    "( note that this applies to an isolated point mass ; a more exact formula given by gould & gaucherel 1997 . ) for example , a magnification of [ @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 can be achieved even if the size of the source is @xmath74   r_e$ ] , note that , when the lens is of jupiter - mass ( earth - mass ) , then a star with radius roughly equal to @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) would fill a disk of radius @xmath77 .",
    "( we have used @xmath78 kpc and @xmath79 ) thus , in spite of the decrease in peak magnification , the large majority of stars in the source population can , when are lensed by planets in s , produce events that should be detectable , at least with good photometry .",
    "the second effect of finite source size on the light curve  is to broaden the width of the perturbed region of the light curve , since some portions of the source may be significantly magnified well before the center of the source achieves its closest approach to the lens .",
    "the light curves can become almost flat - topped .",
    "thus , magnifications close to the peak value may be sustained during the time it takes the source to travel several einstein diameters , and the event appears to last longer than it would have had the lensed source been a point source .",
    "this can be a boon to the detectability of events due to planet - mass lenses , since one of the greatest barriers to detection is the short lifetime of the event .",
    "figure 1 displays a sequence of light curves for the case @xmath80 when comparing the different light curves , note that the peak magnificationdoes not change much , even as the distance of closest approach , @xmath81 changes from @xmath82 to @xmath83 . if the photometric sensitivity of the observations was such that events with peak magnification  above @xmath72 could be detected , then all of these events would be detected . the primary difference as @xmath84 increases ,",
    "is that the time of the observed event  decreases .",
    "even so , for @xmath84 as large as @xmath85 the observed duration is still roughly equal to the time a point - source light curve  would remain above @xmath86 the relationship between @xmath84 and @xmath87 is explored more systematically in figure 2 .",
    "the calculations used to produce these figures assumed that the surface brightness of the lensed star was constant across the face of the star .",
    "more realistic stellar profiles will change the details , but the general features are robust .",
    "the implications are that : ( 1 ) depending on the distribution of source sizes , the detection  probabilities can be significantly increased by finite - source - size effects , and ( 2 ) events that can be detected can also generally be monitored for longer periods of time .",
    "gould ( 1994 ) and peng ( 1997 ) were able to find point - source fits to light curves associated with extended sources .",
    "this degeneracy of the light curve  shape is not expected to be problematic , however , when the source is larger relative to the einstein ring , as it will be in many of the cases relevant to the discovery of wide - orbit planets ( distefano  1998a ) .",
    "moreover , even if there are light curve   degeneracies , these will not necessarily prevent the identification of individual events as having been influenced by finite - source - size effects , since spectral information can break such degeneracies .",
    "real stellar disks exhibit brightness profiles and spectra that have spatial structure .",
    "when a star for which @xmath88 is not negligible is lensed , the observed spectrum , and therefore the light curve  as observed at different wavelengths , will be time - dependent .",
    "this effect can be used to study the lensed star .",
    "( see , e.g. , witt & mao 1994 , witt 1995 , gould 1994 , loeb & sasselov 1995 , simmons , willis & newsam 1995 , gould & welch 1996 , sasselov 1997 , heyrovsky & loeb 1997 , and , for an observation , alcock _ et al .",
    "this time dependence also helps to confirm the interpretation of the event  as due to microlensing  of a source whose size has influenced the shape of the light curve . indeed ,",
    "when the source is large relative to the einsein ring , it is as if a magnifying glass were scanning the face of the lensed star , thus providing a good deal of information about the source star and about the event .",
    "spectral studies , even during short - duration  events can therefore be valuable in breaking the degeneracy for individual events , as can multi - color photometry .",
    "even if spectral information is not available , however , statistical analysis of the ensemble of events would be able to indicate that finite - source - size effects  had played a role .",
    "in particular , the relationship between peak magnitude and duration would be different than it would be for a set of true paczyski light curves ; for large sources , the peak magnification is closely related to source size , while the duration continues to have a more direct relationship to the .      in the companion paper (",
    "distefano  & scalzo 1998 ) we provide an overview of how planet - lens events of different types ( resonant , wide repeating events , wide isolated events ) complement each other . to orient the reader ,",
    "we provide a thumbnail sketch here .    *",
    "orbital separation :  * when the separation , @xmath89 between the central star  and a planet  is much smaller than the star s einstein radius ( typically @xmath90 ) , the large majority of events in which the ps",

    ", the probability of repeating events achieves its maximum value .",
    "in fact , if the photometric sensitivity is good , some repeating events ( in which the source passes through the lensing regions of both the star and a planet ) , will exhibit light curves in which the magnification  has not yet returned to baseline levels when the influence of a second lens becomes apparent .",
    "we refer to this subset of repeating events as  overlap \" events .",
    "conceptually , overlap events are most closely related to repeating events , since they occur when the lensing regions of two lenses are transited by a distant source .",
    "phenomenologically , however , they are  isolated \" events , in that the associated light curves exhibit only a single excursion from the baseline flux .",
    "if the photometry is sensitive enough , there is no wait - time between events , and this increases the probability they will be identified , relative to the probability of detecting other repeating events . because they are relatively long - lived , with their time duration keyed to the duration of stellar - lens events , they are also more likely to be detected than isolated events of short - duration . in this paper",
    "we focus primarily on isolated events of short - duration , since these will be most challenging to detect .",
    "because they appear as isolated events , however , we do include overlap events in the computations described and summarized in  4 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases further , all repeating events display genuine repeats ; i.e. , they restart after a fall back to baseline following an initial event . the probability of repeating events , which scales as @xmath91 decreases , and the probability of isolated  events of short - duration  increases . at large separations ,",
    "isolated events of short - duration  dominate .    thus , each type of event  probes a different region of ps .",

    "( we note , however , that because different spatial orientations are expected , the regions we study with each type of event  can intersect the regions explored by the others . ) detections of each type of event  therefore complement detections of the others , with the ensemble of all events providing information about the spatial structures of and mass distributions within ps .",
    "s. in addition , discoveries of resonant and wide events are subject to different selection effects , allowing them to complement each other in another way .    * the light curves :  * the light curves associated with resonant events are essentially stellar - lens light curves , exhibiting short - lived perturbations due to the presence of a planet . in principle",
    ", the mass ratio between the planet  and star , and the projected value of their orbital separation , can be derived from the light curve ; in practice , there are degeneracies in the physical solutions that must be considered ( gaudi 1997 , gaudi & gould 1997 ) . the light curves associated with wide - orbit events exhibit at least one peak that is of relatively short duration , since at least one lens is a planet  and not a star . for repeating events , as for resonant events ,",
    "the mass ratio and orbital separation can be constrained based on the light curve  alone . as always , there are degeneracies , but the fact that we see two separate encounters in which one source is lensed may help to resolve those degeneracies involving blending and finite source size . for isolated events , the light curve  alone generally provides no specific information about the orbital separation , and we can only derive a lower limit on the distance between the central star and the planet , expressed in terms of the size of the star s einstein radius . if , however , the spectral type of the central starcan be determined ( which may be possible if it contributes a significant fraction of the baseline flux ) , and/or if finite - source - size effects  are important , then we can learn more even about planet lenses giving rise to isolated events .",
    "( see the discussion below . ) in addition , for some isolated events , the form of the light curve  will deviate from the standard form in a measurable way . in a very small fraction of cases",
    "there may be caustic crossings , with the light curve  form also significantly influenced by finite - source - size effects . in others , the light curve  will be well - fit by the formulae of distefano  & mao , allowing the projected orbital separation to be derived .",

    "is that it is possible that observations designed to complement light curve  studies can help us to learn more about isolated events of short - duration .",
    "the additional information can , under favorable circumstances , include the spectral type of the central star  and the mass of the planet  lens .",
    "another interesting question is whether the planets discovered via microlensingare likely to harbor life ; this is discussed in distefano  ( 1998a ) .",
    "finally , we note that it may be possible to detect fine structure within the lensing planetary system , in the form of moons orbiting planets and asteroid or cometary belts ( distefano  & keeton 1998 ) .",
    "the excitement about resonant lensing by planets was fueled , at least in part , by a wonderful coincidence .",
    "gould & loeb ( 1992 ) noted that , if a system identical to our solar system happened to be located halfway between our position and the center of the bulge , and if the system were viewed face - on , the separation of the planet corresponding to jupiter from the system s star would be very close to the value of @xmath7 associated with the mass of the star .",
    "that is , jupiter would be in the zone for resonant lensing .",
    "there are , however , two reasons to be cautious about using this example to limit the search for planets to those in resonant orbits .",
    "first , we do not know that the spatial relationship between the sun and jupiter is an example of a universal property of planetary systems .",
    "mindful of this , bennett & rhie ( 1996 ) have constructed a `` power - of-2 '' planetary model , in which the separation between each planet and the central star increases by a factor of two for each successive planet .",
    "in such a model , most planetary systems can be expected to contain one planet in a resonant orbit .",
    "each such ps .",
    "contains several ( @xmath92 ) planets in s. a second reason to avoid limiting the microlensing searches to resonant planets is that the value of the einstein radius depends not only on the stellar mass , but also on the relative positions of both source and lens to the observer .    in figure 3",
    "we consider planets with orbital separation @xmath93 . for these systems",
    "we show the relationship between the stellar mass , @xmath26 , and @xmath22 , when the orbital period is fixed . we have assumed that the orbital plane is the same as the lens plane , and show those values of @xmath22 for which both lens and lensed source are located in the source galaxy ( the bulge , the magellanic clouds , or m31 ) . if the stellar mass is in the range from @xmath94 to @xmath95 the orbital periods of planets in s range from a few years to a few hundred years , with larger values more typical for more distant galaxies .",

    "we note that the next planet  inward would have a good chance of being viewed in the zone for resonant lensing . indeed for both of these theoretical models",
    ", there is some ambiguity associated with the arbitrarily - chosen position of the closest planet  to the central star . because of this , we carried out a set of calculations in which we averaged over the position of the innermost planet .",
    "we found that , if we truncate the radius of the ps .  at @xmath107",
    "cm , there are on average @xmath108 planets in s for every planet  located in the zone for resonant lensing .",
    "to derive the numbers shown in the table , we averaged over inclination angle @xmath96 , and used equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) to determine the fraction of time any given planet would be in a wide orbit . as above , we have assumed that the orbits are circular .    the considerations in this section show that , under a range of reasonable assumptions , planets in wide orbits are very likely to exist .",
    "in fact the number of planets in wide orbits may be as much as an order of magnitude larger than the number of planets in resonant orbits .",
    "the relative contribution of these two classes of planet lenses to the detection rate depends on our ability to identify the associated events .",
    "we will be interested in the rate at which detectable events occur , and how that rate is influenced by changes in the detection strategy .",
    "the einstein radius of the central star provides a convenient normalization .",
    "the rate of encounters in which the central star serves as a lens , with the magnification due to the central star achieving a peak value of at least @xmath71 ( @xmath109 ) , is proportional to @xmath110 because the width of the central star s lensing region   ( when @xmath109 ) will play an important role , we define @xmath111 to be equal to @xmath7 . if the photometric sensitivity is such that @xmath54 can be smaller than @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath112 @xmath113 ) , so that the effective width of events involving the central star is larger ( @xmath114 ) , the rate of all detected events , including those due to the central star , will increase .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath115 is a convenient normalization constant , because it allows us to compare the rates we compute to the presently - measured rate of events .",
    "this is as follows .",
    "along the direction to the bulge , events are being discovered by the macho team at a rate of roughly @xmath116 per year .",
    "the present detection criteria used by the macho team are strict : @xmath117 , corresponding to @xmath57 ( in eq .",
    "3 ) being set equal to @xmath118 in addition , other teams , surveying different fields with somewhat different strategies , are also surveying the bulge .",
    "for example , the ogle team , which in its first incarnation discovered @xmath119 bulge events , has recently brought a new telescope on - line ( udalski , kubiak & szymanski 1997 ; paczyski _ et al .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume @xmath120 events of the type we use for our normalization per year along the direction to the bulge .",
    "thus , because we use @xmath121 to normalize our results , when we find that a particular detection strategy leads to a rate of detectable events of a certain type ( e.g. , events with @xmath122 repetitions ) equal to @xmath123 this means that between @xmath124 and @xmath125 such events could be discovered per year along the direction to the bulge .",
    "when a wide planetary system serves as a lens , the most common type of event is one in which the track of the source passes through the einstein ring of a single mass . because the rate of encounters associated with a given lens scales as the square root of its mass , encounters in which the star serves as a lens are the most frequent .",
    "let @xmath126 represent the rate of isolated  short - duration  events due to planet  lenses .",
    "@xmath126 is proportional to the linear dimensions of the lensing region .",
    "@xmath127 where the sum is over all of the system s planets , and @xmath128 when finite - source - size effects  are not important , @xmath129 the normalization described in  4.1 , yields a normalized rate of isolated planet - lens events : @xmath130 note that , because the event  rate scales with @xmath131 improvements in photometric sensitivity play an important role in optimizing the rate of detectable events , even when finite - source - size effects  are not important . when finite - source - size effects  do play a role , the increase in rate",
    "can be even larger for some of the terms on the right hand side of equation 8 .",
    "the expression for @xmath126 given in eq .",
    "9 overcounts isolated  events slightly , because the rate of repeating events must be subtracted from it . because , however , isolated events involving a specific lens are generally @xmath132 orders of magnitude more common than repeating events involving the same lens , ( distefano  & mao 1996 ; distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998 ) , @xmath126 generally provides a good estimate of the rate of isolated events involving planets .",
    "the time duration of isolated planetary - lens events , relative to the time duration of stellar - lens events , also scales as @xmath133 .",
    "the implication is that a distribution of events due to lensing by stars with wide - orbit planets is necessarily accompanied by a distribution of shorter - duration events .",
    "the fraction of events in the latter distribution is proportional to the average value of @xmath2 , and the position of the peak or peaks also provides a measure of the mass ratios typical of planetary systems .",
    "possible forms of the distribution of event  s are illustrated in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "( the rates corresponding to the integrated area under the curves for planet - lens events are discussed in  4.3 . )",
    "these figures show results from a set of monte - carlo simulations in which 3 types of ps .",

    "we show the ( unnormalized ) distribution of event  s , defining the  to be the time during which the magnification  was above @xmath136 . in all cases , a long - duration peak in the distribution , due to lensing by the central star ,",
    "is necessarily accompanied by one or more smaller peaks due to short - duration  planet - lens events .",
    "the difference between figure 4 and figure 5 is that different sets of criteria were used to determine whether an event  is detectable .",
    "criteria a ( figure 4 ) require the light curve  to exhibit magnification greater than @xmath43 ( source - lens separation less than @xmath137 ) for at least 1 day in order for the lensing event  to be detected . criteria c ( figure 5 ) require only that the magnification be greater than @xmath72 ( source - lens separation less than @xmath138 ) , and no minimum event duration is required .",
    "criteria c are more ambitious , and allow the effects of lensing by several planets to be seen . in the case of the solar system , there are peaks due to lensing by each of the outer planets , although some of the structure is blurred as the peaks run together .",
    "it is interesting to note that most of the peak structure actually comes from saturn and the planets beyond it , rather than from jupiter .",
    "the reason for this is that the separation between jupiter and the sun is so close to @xmath40 that , for some orientations of the orbital plane with respect to the lens plane , jupiter was in the zone for resonant lensing  at least part of the time .",
    "furthermore , even when it was in a wide orbit , its lensing region  sometimes overlapped that of the sun",
    ". that is , before the magnification  could slip below @xmath72 after jupiter served as a lens , the track of the source would already be in the lensing region  of the sun ( or _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "the result would be one long event  with the light curve  exhibiting two peaks .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to such  overlap \" events .",
    "although the source track passes through the lensing regions of two lenses , there is just one continuous deviation from baseline .",
    "overlap events appear to be isolated events with unusual morphologies that last for times comparable to the durations of stellar - lens events .",
    "overlap events are discussed in the companion paper ( distefano  & scalzo 1998 ) . like isolated events of short - duration ,",
    "overlap events are necessary adjuncts of the presence of -o   planets .",
    "they are a feature of the power - of-@xmath57 simulations as well , when there was often an overlap between the lensing region  of the central star  and the innermost wide planet .    in the power - of-@xmath122 and power - of-@xmath134 models ,",
    "all of the planets were assumed to be of jupiter mass , so there is just one statistically significant peak due to planet  lenses ; the area under this peak is large , however , because it includes the contributions from all of the systems wide planets .      the ps .",
    "we know best is our own .",
    "not only do we know that the sun is accompanied by a planet , but we know that there is a set of planets distributed over several tens of astronomical units ( au ) . if a ps .",
    "identical to the solar system is located in the bulge , the magellanic clouds , or in m31 , several of its planets ( generally jupiter and all of the outer planets ) are in s most of the time , for most orientations of the ecliptic on the sky . if a lensing event  with a solar mass lens lasts for 100 days , then an event in which [ jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune , pluto ] serves as a lens lasts for [ @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 days .",

    "identical to ours , then the durations given in the previous sentence could be translated directly into the percentage of events in which each of the planets in turn could be expected to serve as a lens .",
    "the number of planet - lens events per year would be roughly @xmath144 in baade s window ( for @xmath145 ) and @xmath146 ( for @xmath147 with the present monitoring  strategy , events lasting @xmath148 day or less would not be subjected to detailed enough monitoring  to unambiguously identify them as microlensing  events .    to make contact with specific detection criteria",
    ", we refer to the monte - carlo calculations corresponding to figures 4 and 5 .",
    "these yield a rate of isolated events of only @xmath149 per year for the solar system , when detection criteria a are used .",
    "this is because the lensing region  of jupiter actually overlaps that of the sun for most orientations of the orbital plane on the sky .",
    "thus , jupiter is detected through overlap events , which occur at a rate of @xmath150 per year when detection criteria a are employed .",
    "the only other outer planet  that can produce an event  lasting longer than a day is saturn , and not every event  due to saturn lasts this long .",
    "most of the overlap events should be detectable , and should also provide some evidence of the presence of jupiter .",
    "the set of detection criteria c leads to @xmath151 short - duration  isolated events per year and @xmath152 overlap events .",
    "thus , over a period of @xmath153 years , dozens of planet - lens events could be detected .",
    "the event  s and rates scale with @xmath53 , and @xmath53 depends on finite - source - size effects .",
    "we therefore note that , if the einstein radius  of an earth - mass planet  is @xmath154 then the einstein radius  of [ jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune , pluto ] is [ @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 @xmath160 .",
    "pluto would very likely not be discovered via microlensing .",
    "jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune would be detectable .",
    "furthermore , were the lensed star to be massive and/or evolving , the time duration of the events could be significantly extended by finite - source - size effects .",

    "1997a ) , and their  alert \" web pages ( http://darkstar.astro.washington.edu ) , which list approximate s for many of the 136 bulge events observed during 1995 , 1996 , and 1997",

    "the distribution  of event  s is plotted in figure 6 .",
    "note the appearance of the short - duration  peak .    in light of figure 6",
    "we may ask whether the macho team has already begun to discover concrete evidence for a signature due to planets in the bulge .",
    "this may be the case .",
    "( in fact bennett _",
    "[ 1996a ] have conjectured that one short event  may indeed be due to a planet  in a . )",
    "we emphasize , however , that a good deal of further work would be required to clearly establish it (  4.6 , distefano  & scalzo 1997 , 1998 , distefano  1998a , b ) .",
    "one certain conclusion we can draw from the macho bulge data is that the team has proved that it has the ability to detect short - duration  events .",
    "this is encouraging , since the detection strategies presently used are not optimized for the discovery of short time - scale events .",
    "consider the distribution of event  s. is it likely that a peak due to the presence of lenses with small masses will be hidden by or confused with the short - duration tail of encounters due to lensing by stars ?",
    "three circumstances can make a stellar - lens encounter  have a short measured .",
    "\\(1 ) the relative velocity @xmath28 an observer would measure between the source and the lens may be exceptionally large . since",
    ", however , the distribution of transverse velocities for planet - lens and stellar - lens encounters should be roughly the same , we should be able to disentangle velocity effects , at least for statistical samples of encounters .",
    "\\(2 ) the track of the source may just graze the lens einstein ring . in this case , the peak value of the magnification allows us to measure the distance of closest approach , @xmath84 , and to determine that , although short , the observed encounter  was nevertheless due to the presence of a lens with a larger einstein ring than expected for a planet .",
    "these corrections are implemented by the observing teams .",
    "\\(3 ) light from the lensed source could be blended with light from other sources along the line of sight . if , however , the effects of blending are dramatic enough to shorten the  of an event  significantly , then we should be able to detect evidence for the blending in other ways , and to subtract its effects from the event before comparing its  with that of other events .",
    "because blending can provide a valuable tool for the study of planet - lenses , we discuss it in more detail in separate papers ( distefano1998a , b ) .",
    "we conclude that , if the present generation of monitoring  programs discover a set of isolated planet - lens events , they should be able to reliably separate the signal from the contribution due to stellar lenses .",
    "as we see from figure 2 , the small short - duration   peak \" in the macho team s real data set is distinguishable from the rest of the distribution of event  durations",
    ".      numerical simulations ( figures 4 and 5 ) , the arguments above , and the data from the macho team , all indicate that the observing teams are likely to be able to find convincing evidence of short - duration  events , if there is a population of low - mass lenses . will the teams be able to determine , however , that the events are due to planets , rather than to low - mass machos ?",
    "a related question is whether a signal due to low - mass machos could be obscured due to lensing by ordinary ps .",
    "s. it is difficult to come up with comprehensive answers to such questions , because the distinction between planets and machos is not always clear .",
    "for example , when low - mass objects are discovered to be orbiting a pulsar , they have been called  planets \" . on the other hand , non - luminous , stellar remnants in the galactic halo and",
    "any planet - mass companions they may have would likely be considered as machos .",
    "single , non - luminous planet - mass objects may be referred to as machos , but some of these may have been ejected from ps .",
    "s with luminous central stars .",
    "the most stringent criterion we can use to classify a low - mass object as a planet  is that it should be in orbit with a luminous star .",
    "this definition actually gives us a way to test whether a lensing event  was due to lensing by a planet .    if the central star  of a ps .",
    "lens is luminous , light from the lensed star will be blended with it .",
    "let us suppose that we observe a short - duration  isolated event , and that we can establish the following facts about it .",
    "\\(1 ) not all of the flux emanating from the line of sight to the event  is emitted by the lensed star .",
    "\\(2 ) at least some of the blending is due to light from a star whose position can not be resolved from that of the lensed star , even with sub - arcsecond resolution .    in such a case , given the stellar surface density in the bulge and lmc , it is almost certain that the additional baseline flux emanates from the lens system .",
    "this would definitively establish that the lens giving rise to the short - duration  event  was a planet .",
    "in fact , if the amount of light emanating from the ps . s",
    "central star  can be quantified as a function of wavelength , we may be able to determine its spectral type .",
    "the observability of blended events is discussed in distefano  1998a , b .",
    "we find that the majority of events should still be detectable even when there is blending .",
    "a test of the mass range of the lens ( but not the planet - lens hypothesis ) could be provided by finite - source - size effects .",
    "when spectroscopic studies of the lensed source can establish its real physical size , finite - source - size effects may then allow us to derive the true size of the einstein ring .",
    "this means that , if the value of @xmath175 the ratio between the radius of the lensed star and the einstein radius of the lens , can be measured from the data , @xmath28 can be determined .",
    "furthermore the degeneracy in the lens mass associated with the paczyski light curve is partially broken , since knowing the value of @xmath4 and , through spectral studies , the value of @xmath176 allows us to infer @xmath177 where @xmath178 is a constant whose value is measured . given the distribution of likely values of @xmath22 ( from @xmath179 to @xmath180 , for example , in the bulge ) this generally constrains @xmath26 to within a factor of @xmath181 thus , the hypothesis that any given event  is due to lensing by a planetary - mass can be meaningfully tested . furthermore ,",
    "if the spectral type of the central star  of the lens system has been determined through the study of blending effects , then @xmath22 can be completely determined .",
    "because good photometric sensitivity increases the rate of observable events and lengthens the duration of events that are observed , the the bottom line is that good photometry is the key to increasing the detection rate of planets in s. monitoring that is consistently more frequent than that presently carried out by the monitoring  teams is also important , although hourly monitoring  may not be needed , especially if finite - source - size effects  increase the time during which the event  is observable .",
    "there is another important point as well .",
    "this is that the identification of evidence of blending and/or of finite - source - size effects  can be important . because they can possibly clinch the planet - microlensing  interpretation",
    ", it is worthwhile to search for evidence of these effects in every event .",
    "the analysis of light curve shape can play an important role ; this analysis can be done after the event  has ceased . during the event , it would be valuable to obtain spectra , particularly near the time of peak magnification .",
    "the strategies best suited to the discovery of wide planetary systems have much in common with those best suited to the discovery of planets in resonant orbits . in both cases",
    "it is important to have frequent time sampling of events or event features whose duration may be on the order of hours . in both cases , good photometry is important if we are to carry out meaningful tests of the planetary - system lens hypothesis .",
    "thus , since a detailed search mechanism is already in place to discover planets in the zone for resonant lensing , it is useful to ask how effective that mechanism will be at discovering wide planets , and whether slight modifications of it will make it more effective .",
    "( see sackett [ 1997 ] for an overview of detection strategies designed for planets in the zone for resonant lensing . )",
    "\\(1 ) _ spike analysis : _ the macho and eros teams have been able to place upper limits on the numbers of such events along the direction of the lmc ( renault _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , ansari it et al .",
    "1996 ; alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . along the direction to the bulge it seems likely that the large majority of the events already detected are due to lensing by ordinary stars .",
    "if a significant number of stars have planets in s , then short events due to lensing by these planets are expected .",
    "a spike analysis of existing data from the bulge could be productive in either discovering evidence of short events ( in addition to those already discovered ) or placing upper limits on the number of short - time - scale events that might have occurred . as more data is collected by a larger number of monitoring  teams",
    ", systematic spike analyses should become standard .",
    "\\(2 ) _ frequent monitoring of some fields : _",
    "the importance of the quest for short time - scale events suggests that it might be worthwhile for the teams to each choose one or two fields which they attempt to observe two times per night .",
    "this would allow them to call alerts relatively early for jupiter - mass planets , and to have a better chance of finding evidence of earth - mass planets .",
    "in addition , cooperation among the teams could greatly enhance the probability of finding reliable evidence of short events .",
    "at a recent workshop on microlensing , people associated with three of the teams discussed the advantages of choosing one or two fields that all of the teams would attempt to monitor each night .",
    "a motivating factor for such cooperation is to better understand the relative detection efficiencies of the teams .",
    "the quest for short events provides another important motivation . indeed ,",
    "if each team visited one or two bulge fields twice per night , there would at least occasionally , be 6 - 8 times per night that those fields were checked .",
    "if , on average , 10 events per year were to be discovered in those fields , then , over the course of 3 years , short events could be discovered or ruled out at the @xmath182 level .",
    "in addition , the teams should call alerts for short - duration  events , even if the event  has apparently ceased before they can announce its discovery .",
    "if the short - duration  event  is due to lensing by a planet , calling the alert will allow the follow - up teams to have a better chance of detecting any subsequent repeat that might be due to lensing by another object in the ps . .",
    "\\(3 ) _ use of pixel techniques : _  during the past three years ,",
    "pixel techniques have begun to be used for the study of microlensingin m31 ( tomaney & crotts 1996 ; crotts & tomaney 1996 ; crotts 1996 ; ansari _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; han 1996 ) .",
    "it has been estimated that , were such techniques to be applied to the lmc and bulge fields , the rate of event detection would increase by a factor of @xmath183 ( crotts 1997 ; kaplan 1997 ) .",
    "the reason for the increase is that observable events can occur when the baseline flux we receive from a star is not bright enough for the star to appear on the templates presently used by the teams , if the flux is brought above the detection limits through microlensing .",
    "such events are presently missed by the monitoring  teams . this increase in detection efficiency , would be helpful , particularly in any fields singled out for frequent monitoring .",
    "indeed , the macho team is presently engaged in applying pixel subtraction techniques to their lmc data in an attempt to discover events that were missed by their standard methods of detection .",
    "application of these techniques to the bulge fields would be also helpful .      while monitoring known ongoing events , the follow - up teams have many other stars in their field of view . when the total number , including those not individually above the detection limit ( but which could be brought above the limit if magnified by some reasonable amount ) is large enough",
    ", the follow - up teams can hope to identify new events .",
    "such observations would play a unique role in the identification of new events , particularly the short - duration events that should be associated with wide ps .",
    "s. programs that would allow the so - called follow - up teams to take the lead in event  detection are already underway or are planned ( sahu 1997 ; gould 1997 ) .",
    "indeed , an ideal microlensing  search for the purposes of the detection of planet lenses , is one in which the follow - up teams play the role now played by the monitoring  teams to discover events , and continue the work by monitoring  the light curves of the events they discover .",
    "until now , the search for planets via microlensing  has focused on a very special detection channel .",
    "the work presented here and in the companion paper ( distefano  & scalzo 1998 ) strongly argues for an extension of the search to include planets in s. in this paper we have considered the simplest signal of the presence of planets in s : isolated events of short - duration , that accompany the passage of the track of a distant star in front of the einstein ring of an intervening planet .",
    "isolated events of short - duration  may be the  vanilla \" flavor of planet - lens events .",
    "they are nevertheless , interesting for several reasons .",
    "\\(1 ) if ps .",
    "s such as our own are common , then , with modest changes in detection strategy , we should discover a few isolated events of short - duration   every year .",
    "it seems unlikely that our own solar system is an example of a universal ps . .",
    "it is therefore important to note that a significant fraction of the confirmed planetor brown dwarf systems would also give rise to several , or even tens of isolated short - duration  events per year , if _ they _ were typical of a large fraction of stellar systems .",
    "\\(2 ) isolated events of short - duration  may be the most numerous planet - lens events .",
    "even though the detection probability for a planet  located in the zone for resonant lensing  is enhanced ( e.g. , for a jupiter - mass planet , the rate may be as high as @xmath184 ) , there may be a large enough number of -o  planets , for every planet  in the zone for resonant lensing , to make the detection of isolated events due to planets in s the dominant mode of planet  detection.this is particularly so if ( a ) sensitive photometry can be employed by the monitoring  teams , and ( b ) finite - source - size effects  are important .",
    "\\(3 ) searches can be optimized for the detection of isolated planet - lens events by implementing sensitive photometry .",
    "ideal monitoring  programs would use photometry as sensitive as that of the present - day follow - up teams , but would also use difference techniques , in addition to a template , so that they would be sensitive to the lensing of stars too dim to be on the templates .",
    "although frequent monitoring is desirable , hourly monitoring may not be necessary .",
    "\\(4 ) optimized searches can increase the discovery rate significantly .",
    "event rates for systems like our own solar system , for example , can be doubled .",
    "tests of the hypothesis that all stars are accompanied by a low - mass ( uranus - mass or larger ) companion are well within reach and can be carried out over the next few years .",
    "less conservative hypotheses , say that every star is accompanied by a power - of-2 model with saturn - mass companions , can be ruled out or confirmed in a short time .",
    "\\(5 ) if all we know from the data sets is that an ensemble of short - duration  events has been observed , then we must rely on statistical arguments ( which use the number of stellar - lens events and the numbers of other types of planet - lens events ) to determine what fraction of the short - duration  events may be due to lensing by planets .",
    "ideally , however , the analysis of individual events could tell us some of the following .",
    "( a ) the lens is a planet  orbiting a luminous star ; ( b ) the spectral type and mass of the star ; ( c ) the mass of the planet ; ( d ) the minimum possible orbital separation between the star and planet .",
    "we have pointed out that all of these determinations may be possible for a subset of short - duration  events due to planets .",
    "this is discussed in more detail elsewhere ( distefano  1998a , b ) .",
    "\\(6 ) phenomenologically , overlap events appear to be isolated events , since the associated light curveexhibits just a single deviation from the baseline .",
    "their light curves are distinctive , and provide information about the orbital separation and mass ratio .",
    "overlap events are long - lived relative to isolated events in which just a single planet  serves as a lens , and thus they are also relatively easy to discover . the rate of overlap  events is determined largely by those planets whose physical location is within a few einstein radii of the central star . for the solar system , for example , jupiter and saturn are the most likely to contribute to the rate of overlap  events . for reasons of dynamical stability , there can not be a large number of such planets .",
    "the ratio of the rate of overlap  events relative to the rate of isolated events of short - duration , tells us about the radial structure of ps .",
    "s. in particular it quantifies the size of the population within several @xmath7 of the central star , relative to the population of planets in wider orbits .",
    "this is illustrated by the comparison between the power - of-@xmath57 models , in which planets populate the system out to @xmath107 cm , and for which the ratio is @xmath185 and the solar system , where the ratio is close to unity .",
    "although they may be the most frequent planet - lens events , isolated events of short - duration  are only part of the planet - lens story .",
    "these events are necessarily accompanied by caustic crossing and repeating events .",
    "the statistics and characteristics of ps .",
    "s in other galaxies , and in our own galactic bulge , can best be determined by studying the full complement of events . in the accompanying paper",
    ", we turn our attention to repeating events .",
