    "ngc6383 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ; @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) is a rather compact open cluster which could be part of the sgrob1 association together with ngc6530 and ngc6531 .",
    "the cluster was originally discovered by john herschel in 1834 , and listed as h3689 in herschel s cape catalogue published in 1847 .",
    "most probably due to a clerical error , it also appears in dreyer s new general catalogue as ngc6374 , an identifier that is however not commonly used .",
    "trumpler @xcite pointed out that ngc6383 belongs to a category of clusters in which a few dozen faint stars are closely grouped around a bright hot central star that frequently happens to be a binary system . in the case of ngc6383",
    ", the cluster is centered on the o - type binary hd159176 ( m@xmath7 = 5.7 , see fig.[optical ] ) that dominates the emission from the cluster over a broad range of energies from the near - infrared to the x - ray domain .",
    "apart from hd159176 , the cluster currently harbours no stars earlier than b1 , although de wit et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the eclipsing binary candidate hd158186 ( o9.5v , marchenko et al .",
    "1998 ) might have been ejected from ngc6383 through dynamical interactions in the cluster core .",
    "ngc6383 and more specifically hd159176 are likely responsible for the ionization of the hii region rcw132 ( rodgers , campbell & whiteoak 1960 ) also known as s11 ( sharpless 1953 ) or stromlo67 ( gum 1955 ) .",
    "rodgers et al .",
    "@xcite described rcw132 as a 110arcmin @xmath8 80arcmin medium brightness crescent - shaped region .",
    "images of this emission nebula can be found for instance on plate 131 of lyng  & hansson @xcite .    during a survey of the galactic ridge at 1390mhz ,",
    "westerhout @xcite detected a large ( @xmath9 ) ring - like radio structure roughly centered on ngc6383 .",
    "however , westerhout cautioned that this feature was difficult to separate from the background emission",
    ". part of this source is likely due to rcw132 .",
    "10arcmin.[optical ] ]",
    "according to lloyd evans @xcite , ngc6383 harbours a total of 21 ob stars including hd159176 and v701sco .",
    "the spectrum of hd159176 was described in the _ henry draper catalogue _ as o5e with very wide lines that were almost double on some occasions .",
    "trumpler @xcite was the first to report the double - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) nature of the star and proposed orbital solutions for two possible periods of 4.920 and 3.368days .",
    "the first clear determination of the orbital period was performed by conti , cowley , & johnson @xcite on the basis of optical data .",
    "the orbital solution was subsequently improved by seggewiss & de groot @xcite , lloyd evans @xcite and stickland et al.@xcite .",
    "finally , the most recent orbital solution was published by linder et al.@xcite based on a set of high - resolution optical echelle spectra analysed with a spectral disentangling method . the main result of these spectroscopic studies is that hd159176 consists of two very similar main - sequence stars of spectral type463440 lines are seen in emission whilst heii @xmath104686 is in absorption ( see e.g.  walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) . ] o7((f))v , with the primary being slightly hotter than the secondary , revolving on a circular orbit with a period of 3.367d .",
    "linder et al.@xcite also showed that the components of the system likely have their rotation synchronized with their orbital period .",
    "the photometric monitoring of hd159176 reported by thomas & pachoulakis @xcite revealed low amplitude ( @xmath110.05 mag ) ellipsoidal variations .",
    "however , the absence of photometric eclipses prevented these authors from deriving the inclination of the system .",
    "the thorough analysis by pachoulakis@xcite allowed him to determine stellar radii for both components of the order of 25% of the orbital separation .",
    "the stars hence do not fill up their roche lobe , contrary to the suggestion formulated by conti et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "pfeiffer et al.@xcite reported on the discovery of a uv emission component produced between the two stars , and interpreted this as a signature of a wind - wind interaction that is slightly wrapped around the secondary star .",
    "pachoulakis@xcite derived mass loss rates of 3.2@xmath810@xmath12 and 2.6@xmath810@xmath12m@xmath13yr@xmath14 respectively for the primary and the secondary .",
    "these determinations were based on the fit of the civ @xmath15 1548 - 1551 and nv @xmath15 1239 - 1243 lines with synthetic profiles resulting from the combination of the individual profiles from both stars , and taking into account the effects of wind eclipses depending on the orbital phase .",
    "we note that , following a less sophisticated approach and using the same spectral lines , howarth & prinja @xcite derived a significantly lower mass loss rate of 6@xmath810@xmath16m@xmath13yr@xmath14 for both stars .",
    "hd159176 was detected as a rather bright x - ray emitter by the _ einstein _ ( chlebowski , harnden , & sciortino 1989 ) and _ rosat _ ( berghfer , schmitt , & cassinelli 1996 ) satellites .",
    "more recently , the observations performed with the _ xmm - newton",
    "_ satellite shed new light on the x - ray emission from this close binary system ( de becker et al .",
    "hd159176 is a rather soft thermal x - ray emitter whose spectrum is dominated by plasma at temperatures of 2  3 and 6  10mk .",
    "such temperatures are typical of plasma heated by shocks respectively within individual stellar winds and in colliding winds in close binaries .",
    "an additional indication of x - ray emission produced by the colliding winds comes from the x - ray luminosity that is too high to be explained by intrinsic x - ray emission from individual stellar winds alone .",
    "the modelling of the x - ray emission from the colliding winds revealed that the previous determinations of the mass loss rates ( see above ) may have been overestimated .",
    "finally , de becker et al.@xcite showed that purely thermal emission models failed to fit the x - ray spectrum up to 10.0 kev , although very good results were obtained using an additional power law to fit a high energy tail .",
    "this may point to a non - thermal emission component presumably produced by inverse compton scattering of photospheric uv photons by relativistic electrons accelerated in the wind interaction zone ( de becker 2007 ) . in this context , it is interesting to note that ngc6383 lies very close to the centre of the error box of the egret @xmath17-ray source 3egj1734@xmath183232 ( torres et al .",
    "2003 ) . whilst this @xmath17-ray source is usually associated with the supernova remnant g355.6@xmath190.0",

    "this system very likely consists of two almost identical and essentially unevolved b1 - 1.5 stars ( andersen , nordstrom , & wilson 1980 , bell & malcolm 1987 ) revolving around each other in @xmath21days .",
    "a number of photometric and spectroscopic studies of ngc6383 can be found in the literature .",
    "photoelectric measurements of 27 stars were presented by eggen @xcite whilst th @xcite obtained photographic photometry of 97 objects down to @xmath22mag as well as objective prism plates .",
    "antalov @xcite reported photographic measurements of 32 stars in the neighbourhood of ngc6383 .",
    "fitzgerald et al .",
    "@xcite analysed photoelectric measurements of 25 stars as well as low and medium resolution spectra of 11 objects within 2arcmin from the cluster centre .",
    "lloyd evans @xcite presented photoelectric and photographic measurements of several hundred objects within 12arcmin from hd159176 , along with spectral classifications for 17 stars and radial velocities for 14 of them .",

    "@xcite and paunzen et al .",
    "@xcite inferred an @xmath26 colour excess of 0.30 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "little or no spatial variation of the reddening was found over the central part of the cluster .",
    "the only exception is the study of antalov @xcite who suggested a scatter in @xmath31 between 0.6 and 1.3 .",
    "lloyd evans @xcite noted that the cluster is probably located right in front of a dust absorption cloud .",
    "in fact , some redder stars in the field were found to have a distance modulus only slightly larger than the one of the cluster .",
    "there exists also a region of apparently higher stellar density where the dust cloud might be thinner , thus allowing us to see some background objects . in the atlas of dark clouds of dobashi et al .",
    "@xcite , ngc6383 appears indeed located on a thin bridge connecting the two giant cloud complexes tgu2164 and tgu2190 ( see fig.18 - 1 - 9 of dobashi et al .",
    "this position corresponds to the intersection of two large cavities in the galactic plane which might have been created by the action of early - type stars in ngc6383 and other young clusters in this region .    while trumpler @xcite estimated a distance of 2.1kpc for ngc6383 ,",
    "more recent studies usually agree about a smaller distance in the range between @xmath32 and @xmath33kpc .",

    "accounting for the binarity of hd159176 and adopting @xmath43 ( instead of 3.0 as used by graham 1967 ) , one obtains a distance modulus of @xmath44 ( @xmath45kpc ) .",
    "a nice confirmation of these distance estimates comes from the spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the eclipsing binary system v701sco by bell & malcolm @xcite who derived a distance of @xmath46pc .",
    "finally , rastorguev et al .",
    "@xcite used a statistical parallax technique based on the kinematical parameters ( proper motions and radial velocities ) to derive a cluster distance of 1.18kpc . to our knowledge ,",
    "the lowest distance estimate is the one by kharchenko et al .",
    "@xcite who quote 985pc , although it is not fully clear what technique was used to arrive at this number . in summary , the distance to ngc6383 thus appears rather well determined at @xmath1kpc .",
    "the core of ngc6383 is rather compact ( see fig .",
    "[ optical ] ) .",
    "kharchenko et al .",
    "@xcite derived a core radius ( defined as the radius where the decrease of stellar surface density drops abruptly ) of 4.8arcmin and a corona radius ( where the surface density becomes equal to the average of the surrounding field ) of 15arcmin .",

    "however , these results critically depend on the actual value of the proper motions and we have seen above that the various determinations are only in coarse agreement .",
    "eggen @xcite drew attention to the similarity of ngc6383 with ngc2264 in the sense that the colour - magnitude diagrams of the two clusters show a rather normal main sequence down to spectral type about a0 whilst stars of later spectral types are located above the main sequence .",

    "@xcite identified eight likely cluster members that fall in the region of pms objects in the colour - colour and colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "these authors derived a cluster age of @xmath58myr . given the rather narrow locus of potential pms stars , they argued that star formation must have been quite coeval , except for hd159176 for which they inferred an age of @xmath59myr , suggesting that this star triggered the formation of lower mass stars in ngc6383 . on the other hand",
    ", lloyd evans @xcite suggested that the formation of lower mass stars ceased prematurely after the formation of the central cluster of massive stars , resulting in a relative lack of faint stars and the absence of ttauri stars as bright as those found in regions of continuous star formation . despite these conflicting interpretations",
