    "we refer the reader to @xcite for detailed description of the instrument setup and photometry reduction procedures . altogether @xmath2 photometric epochs were collected in the @xmath3-band over five observing seasons . the number of data points per observing season vary from 56 to 130 and season length vary from @xmath4202d to @xmath4256d .",

    "we note that the mean brightness of the star and its color are typical for the galactic bulge rr  lyrae stars , but we admit that spread of these parameters in the bulge is very large , as compared e.g. to the magellanic cloud pulsators .",
    "the star was identified by @xcite as rrd pulsator , although its period ratio is somewhat not typical , @xmath7  lower than for majority of the rrd stars with a similar period of the fundamental mode  see the petersen diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] .",
    "we note that we have analysed in detail the stars deviating in the petersen diagram in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "majority of these stars show modulation of pulsation modes akin to the blazhko effect . this in not the case for ogle - blg - rrlyr-24137 , as we show in this paper .",

    "it is unresolved with @xmath11 ( frequency separation is smaller than @xmath13 , @xmath14  data length ) .",
    "such signal is a signature of non - stationary nature of the fundamental mode , a likely slow ( not resolved within available data length ) variation of its amplitude and/or phase .",
    "it increases the noise level in the fourier transform and may hide additional peaks .",
    "to get rid of this signal and search for additional frequencies we conducted the time - dependent prewhitening on a season - to - season basis .",
    "this technique is described by @xcite and is based on the time - dependent fourier analysis @xcite followed by the data prewhitening . in a nutshell , data were divided into five subsets , each corresponding to one observing season .",
    "next , we fitted the sine series to each of the subsets independently , with all frequencies listed in the top part of tab .",
    "[ tab : freqs ] , adjusting the amplitudes and phases , but keeping the frequencies fixed ( as determined from the just described analysis of the full data ) .",
    "any possible frequency changes are then reflected in the variation of respective phases .",
    "we stress that number of data points and season lengths are sufficient to conduct such analysis ( see first paragraph of this section ) .",
    "results of the subset analysis are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.tdfd ] , in which upper panel shows the amplitude variation of the fundamental and first overtone modes , as well as of the frequency denoted in tab .",
    "[ tab : freqs ] by @xmath15 , interpreted in the following sections as additional pulsation mode .",
    "the lower panel shows the phase variations .",
    "the non - stationarity of the fundamental mode is clearly visible : its phase strongly vary and also its amplitude change .",
    "the variation of other two modes is also clear but less pronounced .",
    "residuals from the five independent fits are merged and analysed .",
    "non - stationary signals are removed , provided that associated variation is not significant within one observing season .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the noise level in the fourier transform drops , which is also due to the levelling of possible season - to - season zero - point differences in the photometry . in the data we find one additional significant signal listed in the bottom part of tab .",
    "[ tab : freqs ] ( last row ) .",
    "after prewhitening the data with frequencies corresponding to the fundamental and first overtone modes , significant signal appears in the frequency spectrum close to @xmath16 ( top row in fig .  [ fig.fsp ] ) .",
    "two interpretations are possible .",
    "either it is an independent pulsation mode , which we denote by @xmath15 , or it is a signature of modulation of the fundamental mode . in the latter case close multiplet structures should be detected at the frequency of the fundamental mode and its harmonics , @xmath17 . in the ground - based data these are typically triplets , which may be strongly asymmetric and appear as doublets ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the frequency separation between the multiplet / doublet components corresponds to modulation frequency and its inverse corresponds to modulation period .",
    "here we denote the modulation frequency as @xmath18 .",
    "hence our two interpretations for the discussed frequency are @xmath19 ( independent pulsation mode ) or @xmath20 ( modulation doublet ; resulting modulation period is @xmath21d ) . except one ( @xmath22 )",
    ", all other frequencies detected in the frequency spectrum may be expressed as linear combinations of @xmath12 , @xmath23 and @xmath15 , or as linear combinations of @xmath12 , @xmath23 and @xmath18 .",
    "these two possible interpretations are collected in the third and fourth columns of tab .",
    "[ tab : freqs ] .",
    "the only frequency that can not be represented this way is denoted as @xmath22 .",
    "the period ratios , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are far from those expected for radial modes .",
    "the first period ratio is encountered in rr lyrae stars , but in relation to first overtone period , not the fundamental mode period ( see section  [ ssec : addmode ] for more details ) .",
    "we do not find any frequency combinations involving this frequency , consequently we do not have a proof that it originates from ogle - blg - rrlyr-24137 .",
    "detection of @xmath22 is certain ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this signal may correspond to unresolved blend or e.g. other , non - radial pulsation mode .",
    "we ignore this signal in the following discussion .",
    "which of the two interpretations is correct ?",
    "we argue that the modulation scenario is unlikely .",
    "our arguments are :    * in the case of modulation we expect equidistant triplets , which are not detected . this is not a strong point however , as triplets are often highly asymmetric and may appear as doublets . *",
    "the highest signals corresponding to modulation are detected at @xmath27 and @xmath28 but we do not find any significant signal at @xmath29 or @xmath30 ( see bottom row in fig .",
    "[ fig.fsp ] , arrows mark the expected location of the modulation side peaks ) !",
    "the side peaks at harmonic frequencies may be slightly higher than at @xmath11 @xcite but here signal at @xmath31 is missing .",
    "in addition side peaks are much higher than harmonics itself ; even more , the harmonic at @xmath32 is not detected at all ( bottom right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig.fsp ] ) . *",
    "a close and significant signal at @xmath11 is detected , but at a separation corresponding to @xmath33 ( third row in fig .",
    "[ fig.fsp ] ) .",
    "if we assume that this signal corresponds to a true modulation frequency , i.e. @xmath34 we have even more severe problem with modulation scenario as incomplete quintuplets appear in the spectrum then . *",
    "incomplete quintuplets are detected at @xmath16 and @xmath32 .",
    "these are extreme quintuplets with all low frequency components missing ( only @xmath35 and @xmath36 are detected ) . *",
    "detection of modulation peak at higher order radial mode combination frequency , at @xmath37 , is also suspicious , taking into account that @xmath32 itself is not detected .",
    "based on these arguments we conclude that modulation scenario is unlikely .",
    "the second scenario , excitation of additional , independent pulsation mode is most likely .",
    "interpretation of frequency spectrum faces no difficulty in this case .",
    "detected signals are low - order linear combinations of the three modes .",
    "this is the interpretation we adopt in the remaining of this paper .      in the frequency spectrum",
    "we firmly detect a sub - harmonic of @xmath15 , a significant signal at @xmath38 .",
    "deviation from exact sub - harmonic is negligible , @xmath39c / d ( estimated by the non - linear least - square fit of the time - series ) .",
    "we do not find other sub - harmonic frequencies .",
    "the presence of sub - harmonic frequency is a signature of period doubling of @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , we can directly see the effect in the disentangled light curve corresponding to @xmath15 .",
    "the phased light curves corresponding to the three pulsation modes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.curves ] . to get the light curve of the fundamental mode we first subtracted from the data a sine series with all frequencies listed in tab .  [ tab : freqs ] except those corresponding to @xmath11 and @xmath16 , and next phased the data with @xmath40 .",
    "the light curves for the first overtone and for the additional mode were extracted in a slightly different manner . in order to fully remove the non - stationary fundamental mode from the data , we used time - dependent prewhitening on a season - to - season basis , as described above .",
    "this time however , we fitted the sine series to each of the subsets without @xmath12 and @xmath41 terms ( to get the first overtone light curve ) or without @xmath15 and @xmath42 terms ( to get the light curve of the additional mode ) .",
    "the resulting prewhitened data were phased either with @xmath43 or with @xmath44 .",
    "period doubling effect is weak , but visible in the light curve of the additional mode .",
    "we see alternating deep and shallow minima .",
    "the differences are also visible at maximum light .",
    "fourier fit ( over - plotted ) confirms the effect clearly . in fig .",
    "[ fig.eo ] we present a different visualization of the effect : even and odd pulsation cycles are plotted with different symbols . the effect is well visible , but certainly not very strong .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our star is not a typical rrd star because of low @xmath45 period ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] ) . it is hence interesting to investigate whether light curves of the fundamental and first overtone modes are typical for rr  lyrae stars . to this aim",
    ", we compare their lowest order fourier decomposition parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with the parameters for rrab and rrc stars of the ogle - iii catalog  fig .",
    "[ fig.fps ] .",
    "amplitudes of both modes are lower than for majority of the rrab / rrc stars , which is expected ( two modes saturate the driving mechanism ) .",
    "amplitude of the first overtone is only slightly lower , while amplitude of the fundamental mode is significantly lower .",
    "consequently its @xmath48 value is also very low . on the other hand ,",
    "the fourier phase for the fundamental mode is typical for the fundamental mode pulsators . in the case of the first overtone mode ,",
    "both amplitude ratio and fourier phase are typical .",
    "we also note that light curve displayed in the bottom panel of fig .  [ fig.curves ] resembles that observed for close ( contact ) binary systems .",
    "such interpretation is unlikely for the discussed star , however .",
    "the orbital period would be slightly below @xmath49hours then .",
    "a simple estimate based on the third kepler law shows that it is not possible to fit an rr  lyrae - type star inside a resulting tight orbit .",
    "assuming total mass of the system in a range @xmath50 solar masses the resulting semi - major axes of the orbit would be in between @xmath51 and @xmath52 solar radii .",
    "the typical radii expected for rr  lyrae - type stars are @xmath53 .",
    "similar radii are expected for the less massive relatives of rr  lyrae stars that evolved in a tight binary system  the binary evolution pulsators ( beps , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( @xmath54 for the star discovered by * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that additional variability depicted in the lower panel of fig .  [ fig.curves ] can not result from a blend of rrd star and of a tight binary system , as we clearly detect four combination frequencies involving @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : freqs ] ) . also , rotation effects are rather unlikely to be the source of the variability , as rr lyrae stars are slow rotators @xcite , while variability present in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.curves ] occurs on a time - scale of less than a day .",
    "the period ratio between the additional mode and the first overtone , @xmath55 , indicates that the additional mode may correspond to the radial third overtone , although the period ratio seem to high . to check it ,",
    "we have computed a set of rr  lyrae models with different masses , luminosities and metallicities in a large parameter range ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) covering the full instability strip .",
    "the models were computed with the warsaw pulsation codes @xcite adopting opal opacity tables @xcite and @xcite solar abundance mixture .",
    "all models adopt @xmath59 ( results do not depend strongly on the choice of @xmath60 , on opacity tables or on solar mixture ) .",
    "these are envelope models with homogeneous chemical composition .    in the petersen diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig.models ] we show only the models with period ratios closest to the period ratios determined for ogle - blg - rrlyr-24137 .",
    "the three panels show , from top to bottom , the @xmath45 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 radial mode period ratios .",
    "all these models have @xmath63 , which is typical for rr  lyrae stars and adopt either high metallicity ( @xmath64 , green symbols ) or low metallicity ( @xmath65 , red symbols ) , and have different luminosities as indicated in the key .",
    "model sequences run horizontally across the instability strip with a @xmath66k step in effective temperature .",
    "filled symbols correspond to models in which fundamental and first overtone modes are simultaneously excited ( their linear growth rates , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are positive ) , which is a necessary condition for ( non - resonant ) double - mode pulsation .",
    "third overtone is stable in all the models ( see the discussion in next paragraphs ) .",
    "first , we note that not typical first overtone to fundamental mode period ratio may be explained by large metallicity of the star and relatively low luminosity ( which is expected at higher metallicities , see also * ? ? ?",
    "we note that galactic bulge is characterized by large metallicity spread and large , solar - like metallicities are not rare ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , with large metallicity we can not reproduce the other period ratios , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , they are much higher than high metallicity models predict . in order to approach these two period ratios",
    "we need very low metallicity values ( which are more typical for rr  lyrae stars ) .",
    "the observed @xmath69 ratio is not far from the @xmath65 @xmath61 model ratios .",
    "we face the most severe difficulty with @xmath70 period ratio which can not be reproduced with the models . reducing",
    "the metallicity further does not help .",
    "the closest models are characterised with low @xmath71 ratio , but are located far on the blue side of the instability strip .",
    "we have also checked whether with low mass models , with masses in between @xmath72 solar masses , we can match the observed period ratios better .",
    "such masses are expected for the binary evolution pulsators , for which light curves may resemble those of rr lyrae stars @xcite .",
    "although we can match @xmath73 with high metallicity models , in the case of other period ratios , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the disagreement is even worse than in the case of rr  lyrae models .",
    "the radial mode interpretation faces the following difficulties :    * we can not reproduce the three period ratios assuming consistent model parameters .",
    "@xmath45 requires high metallicity , other two period ratios require very low metallicity values * @xmath70 can not be reproduced with the models .",
    "it is too high as compared to the model predictions for the third - to - first overtone period ratio . *",
    "third overtone is always linearly stable in the models .",
    "the last difficulty is actually a problem of excitation mechanism for the postulated third overtone , which can not be non - resonant in such case , but may occur through a mode resonance .",
    "we note that even in the non - resonant scenario , the linear instability of two modes is only a necessary condition for the double - mode pulsation .",
    "majority of the rrd stars form a well defined and tight sequence in the petersen diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] ) , while models predict simultaneous instability of the two modes over a much larger area .",
    "a mode selection mechanism is in action here , which we do not understand , however @xcite .",
    "we note that our star does not fit the progression formed by the majority of rrd stars .",
    "why these and other stars deviate from the main progression is not known . in @xcite we suggest that these stars might be in a transient state following the rrab@xmath74rrd mode switch .",
    "we note that similar to stars analysed in that paper , in ogle - blg - rrlyr-24137 the fundamental mode varies on a long time - scale , which is manifested by non - coherent signal in the frequency spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig.fsp ] ) and well visible in fig .",
    "[ fig.tdfd ] .",
    "other explanation that comes to mind is a different internal structure of these stars e.g. the presence of discontinuities in the chemical profile along the radius which may strongly affect the computed period ratios of the radial modes . without an analysis of the full evolutionary models this is speculative however .",
    "the other explanation is that additional mode is non - radial .",
    "as described in the introduction there is a new group of radial ",

    "there is no firm detection of sub - harmonic frequencies in stars detected in the ground - based observations .",
    "marginal detection was reported in four out of 147 stars analysed by @xcite ( ogle - iii data ) .",
    "amplitudes of non - radial mode in the discussed group are typically few percent of the radial mode amplitude . to the contrary , in our star amplitude of additional mode",
    "is comparable to radial mode amplitudes .",

    "we note that non - radial modes are linearly unstable in a large frequency range in the models @xcite .",
    "the mode selection mechanism however , remains obscure ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the additional frequency corresponds to independent pulsation mode , but whether it is a radial mode or non - radial mode can not be answered at the moment .",
    "a firmly detected period doubling is most likely a resonant effect as first analysed by @xcite .",
    "it is hard to point which resonance may be responsible for the effect in the case of our star , as we can not firmly identify the mode itself .",
