    "in @xcite we have studied a conditioned space - time brownian motion which appears naturally in the framework of representation theory of the affine lie algebra @xmath2 : a space - time brownian motion @xmath3 conditioned ( in doob s sense ) to remain in a moving boundary domain @xmath4 which can be seen as the weyl chamber associated to the root system of the affine lie algebra @xmath2 .",
    "the present paper deals with the case of any affine lie algebras .",
    "let us describe briefly the framework of the paper .",
    "first we need an affine lie algebra @xmath0 . as in the finite dimensional case , for a dominant integral weight @xmath5 of @xmath0 one defines the character of an irreducible highest - weight representation @xmath6 of @xmath0 with highest weight @xmath5 , as a formal series defined for @xmath7 in a cartan subalgebra @xmath8 of @xmath0 by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the weight space of @xmath6 corresponding to the weight @xmath11 .",
    "this formal series converges for every @xmath7 in a subset of the cartan subalgebra which does nt depend on @xmath5 . a particular choice of an element @xmath12 in the region of convergence of the characters",
    "is called a specialization . for two dominant weights @xmath13 and @xmath5 , the following decomposition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the multiplicity of the module with highest weight @xmath16 in the decomposition of @xmath17 , allows to define a transition probability @xmath18 on the set of dominant weights , letting for @xmath16 and @xmath5 two dominant weights of @xmath0 , @xmath19 where @xmath7 is chosen in the region of convergence of the characters .",
    "such a markov chain has been recently considered by c. lecouvey , e. lesigne , and m. peign in @xcite .",
    "it is a natural question to ask if there exists a sequence @xmath20 of elements of @xmath8 such that the corresponding sequence of markov chains converges towards a continuous process and what the limit is .",
    "one can show that there are basically three cases depending on the scaling factor . roughly speaking",
    "the three cases are the following . when the scaling factor is @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) , the limiting process has to do with a brownian motion conditioned ( in doob s sense ) to remain in a weyl chamber ( resp .",
    "an alcove ) associated to the root system of an underlying finite lie algebra .",
    "when @xmath24 , the limiting process has to do with a space time brownian motion conditioned to remain in a weyl chamber associated to the root system of the affine lie algebra .",
    "figure 1 below illustrates three distinct asymptotic behaviors in the case when the affine lie algebra is @xmath2 .",
    "the weyl chamber @xmath25 is the area delimited by yellow and orange half - planes . essentially , when the scaling factor is @xmath21 with @xmath22 , the @xmath26-component of the limiting process is @xmath27 and its projection on @xmath28 is a brownian motion conditioned to remain positive .",
    "when the scaling factor is @xmath21 with @xmath23 , the projection of the limiting process on @xmath29 lives in an interval ( highlighted in green within figure 1 ) and its projection on @xmath28 is a brownian motion conditioned to remain in an interval . when the scaling factor is @xmath30 , the projection of the limiting process on @xmath29 is a space - time brownian motion conditioned to remain in @xmath25 , the time axis being @xmath31 and the space axis being @xmath28",
    "this is this last case which is considered in the paper , for any affine lie algebras .",
    "[ awc ]    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ affine lie algebras and their representations ] we briefly recall the necessary background on representation theory of affine lie algebras .",
    "we introduce in section [ markovchains ] random walks on the set of integral weights of an affine lie algebra @xmath0 , and markov chains on the set of its dominant integral weights , considering tensor products of irreducible highest weight representations of @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the weyl character formula implies that they satisfy a reflection principle . in section",
    "[ scaling limit of random walks ] we consider a sequence of random walks obtained for particular specializations involving the weyl vector @xmath1 of the affine lie algebra , and prove that its scaling limit is a space - time standard brownian motion with drift @xmath1 , living on the cartan subalgebra of @xmath0 .",
