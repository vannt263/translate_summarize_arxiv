    "as has been recently pointed out in the literature  [ 1 - 4 ] , the analysis of the precision data on the decays @xmath2 from lep and sld has shown good agreement with the predictions of the standard electroweak model ( sm )  @xcite with the exception of the parameter @xmath0 defined as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the effective b quark coupling constants and @xmath7  @xcite . since 1995",
    ", the lep+sld average value of @xmath0 has differed from the sm prediction of 0.935  @xcite by between 2.4 and 3.1 standard deviations . the evolution with time of the lep+sld average value of @xmath0",
    "is shown in table 1 and fig.1 [ 1,7 - 13 ] .",
    "it is important to note that , in the sm , the prediction for @xmath0 is essentially a fixed number with no significant dependence on the values of the masses of of the top quark or the higgs boson ( see figs 5 - 7 below ) .",
    "combining the @xmath0 measurement with that of @xmath8 , which shows relatively good agreement with the sm , enables the effective b quark couplings @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath9 , @xmath10 to be extracted  [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "when this is done , the largest deviation from the sm prediction is found to be in the right handed effective coupling @xmath10 which is about 40@xmath11 and three standard deviations higher than the sm prediction .    the aim of the present note is a thorough study of the data dependence of the lep+sld average value of @xmath0 .",
    "important questions concern the consistency of individual measurements , and the effect of one or a few ` outlying ' measurements on the average . at sld",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is measured directly from the forward / backward , left / right asymmetry of tagged b quarks .",
    "three different types of measurement are made .",
    "the b quarks are tagged using a decay vertex and the jet charge , a semi - leptonic weak decay , or a @xmath12 tag  @xcite .",
    "the lep value of @xmath0 is instead derived from the @xmath13-pole forward / backward charge asymmetry , related to @xmath0 by the expression : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the parameter defined similarly to @xmath0 ( eqn.(1.1 ) ) for the electron . in general lepton universality i.e. @xmath16 , is assumed .",
    "each of the four lep experiments measures @xmath17 using either a lepton tag or the combination of decay vertex and jet charge measurements .",
    "thus there are eight separate ( though not completely uncorrelated ) lep measurements of @xmath18 . using the lep+sld average value of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and",
    "eqn.(1.2 ) the corresponding values of @xmath0 for each lep experiment and each analysis method may be calculated .",
    "these results are shown , together with the three direct sld measurements , in table 2 and fig.2 .",
    "the data shown are the most recent ( spring 1999 ) available at the time of writing .",
    "they are essentially the same as those presented at the 1998 vancouver conference  @xcite except for the recent important update  @xcite of the sld jet charge measurement which yields an sld average value of @xmath0 that is consistent , at the one standard deviation level , with the sm prediction .",
    "because the lep value of @xmath0 depends directly on the lep+sld average value of @xmath19 , it is of interest to compare the different measurements of this quantity .",
    "each of the four lep experiments measures @xmath19 either via the forward / backward leptonic charge asymmetry : @xmath21 or by the analysis of @xmath22-polarisation .",
    "the angular average of the @xmath22-polarisation   measures @xmath23 , whereas the angular distribution of the polarisation is also sensitive to @xmath15 .",
    "combining , for each lep experiment , under the assumption of lepton universality , the measurements of @xmath23 and @xmath15 , and including @xmath15 as measured at sld by the left / right electron beam polarisation asymmetry , leads to the nine independent measurements of @xmath19 shown in table 3 and fig.3 .",
    "very good consistency can be seen in table 2 and fig.2 between the 11 different measurements of @xmath0 ( @xmath24 for consistency of the measurements with their weighted mean ) .",
    "the lep and sld average values agree within 0.2@xmath1 .",
    "as noted also for the 1996 data set  @xcite , the mutual consistency of the different @xmath19 measurements is somewhat less satisfactory . although the @xmath25 test gives : @xmath26 which is acceptable , three measurements ( opal @xmath27 and the @xmath22-polarisation   measurements of delphi and opal ) all show negative deviations of 1.5@xmath1 or more from the weighted average value .",
    "in contrast , all the positive deviations are @xmath28 1@xmath1 .",
    "the average value of @xmath19 , and hence the derived lep value of @xmath0 is thus sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of these data , as will be discussed below .",
    "the situation concerning the consistency of the @xmath22-polarisation  measurements , both with each other , and with the other determinations of @xmath19 , discussed in detail for the 1996 data set in reference  @xcite , has recently been improved by the new , more precise ,    .",
    "the time evolution of the lep+sld average values of @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a simple monte carlo program was used to generate ensembles of @xmath0 measurements distributed according to the statistical and systematic errors of the different lep and sld experiments as shown in tables 2 and 6 .",
    "the correlated and uncorrelated components of the different @xmath0 and @xmath17 measurements were properly taken into account . in all cases except one ( see below ) the systematic errors were modeled according to gaussian functions with rms equal to the quoted errors .",
    "the error on the lep+sld average value of @xmath19 used to extract the lep values of @xmath0 according to eqn(1.2 ) was taken to be gaussian and 100@xmath11 correlated between the different measurements .",
    "the standard model value of @xmath0 ( 0.935 ) was assumed , and the fraction , @xmath29 , of ensembles of measurements with a simple mean value of @xmath0 less than that given by the data ( @xmath30 ) was noted . in table 6",
    "the values of @xmath29 ( corresponding to a one - sided cl ) are shown for several different hypotheses concerning the errors .",
    "the first row corresponds to the quoted errors and assumes gaussian distributions . in the second row ,",
    "all systematic errors are chosen according to uniform distributions with rms equal to the quoted errors . in the third ( fourth )",
    "rows the effect is shown of increasing ( decreasing ) the systematic errors of all the lep experiments by a factor 1.5 . in the fifth row is shown the effect of reducing the systematic errors of the sld experiments by a factor 2.7 so that the average systematic error becomes equal to the uncorrelated lep systematic error .",
    "finally , in the last two rows an additional scale factor of 1.5 or 1/1.5 is applied to the systematic errors of all experiments .",
    "as anticipated above , different scenarios for the systematic errors do not have a dramatic effect on the significance of the observed deviation .",
    "use of a uniform distribution instead of a gaussian one ( expected to reduce the tails of distribution ) in fact only gives a 2@xmath11 relative change in @xmath29 .",
    "assuming that the sld systematic error is reduced to the same level as the current lep one , overestimation ( underestimation ) of all systmatic errors by a factor 1.5 gives cls of 0.44@xmath11 ( 1.4@xmath11 ) that the observed fluctuation is purely statistical , to be compared with 1.2@xmath11 for the nominal errors .",
    "it may finally be remarked that a previous study  @xcite of z decay measurements showed a clear tendency to overestimate point - to - point systematic errors and to underestimate correlated ones . correcting for the first effect would increase the significance of any deviation , while correcting for the second would tend to decrease it .",
    "unfortunately , there are insufficient independent measurements to perform a similar analysis in the present case .",
    "this paper has studied , in detail , the data dependence of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the individual measurements of both @xmath0 and the related ( for lep ) parameter @xmath19 show quite good internal consistency . for @xmath0 the largest positive deviation from the wa",
    "is given by the aleph jet charge measurement .",
    "removing this increases the @xmath0 deviation from -2.4@xmath1 to -2.8@xmath1 . the single measurement with the largest weight tending to increase the size of the deviation is the opal lepton @xmath18 measurement .",
    "removing this reduces the @xmath0 deviation to -1.7@xmath1 . for @xmath19",
    "it may be noted that the @xmath31 measurement of opal and the @xmath22-polarisation   measurements of delphi and opal all lie about 2@xmath1 below the wa . excluding these measurements",
    "slightly increases the @xmath0 deviation to -2.6@xmath1 .",
    "the deviation observed is much larger ( -2.5@xmath1 ) if only the most accurate measurements of each raw observable are used , than for all the remaining measurements ( -0.82@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is a possible hint that the systematic errors of the ` most accurate ' measurements may be underestimated , leading to an overestimation of the deviation from the sm for these data .",
    "the independent measurements of @xmath0 for each lep experiment give smaller deviations for all experiments , except l3 , than when the world average value of @xmath19 is used to extract @xmath0 .",
    "the naive wa ( neglecting error correlations ) of the individual measurements of @xmath0 of the four lep experiments and sld shows only a -1.3@xmath1 deviation . using the world average value of @xmath19 to extract @xmath0 from the lep experiments yields a deviation of -2.1@xmath1 to be compared with -1.0@xmath1 for the combined sld experiments .",
    "a study of the modelling and the degree of optimism / conservatism in the estimation of systematic errors shows essentially identical results for gaussian or uniform distributions and values for the cl for agreement with the sm that varies from 0.44@xmath11 to 1.9@xmath11 , as compared to the nominal value of 1.2@xmath11 .    in the future",
    ", some improvement may be expected in the sld values of @xmath19 and @xmath0 , mainly due to an improved understanding of systematic errors  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "no significant improvement is to be expected from the lep results which , although many are still ` preliminary ' , are almost entirely based on the full lep1 statistics .",
    "it may be noted that a recent summary of the sld data  @xcite found slightly different values for the lep , sld average values of @xmath0 of 0.877(21 ) , 0.898(29 ) respectively ( compare with the values given in table 2 ) .",
    "the small differences from the values used above do not affect any of the conclusions of this study .",
    "this paper is based on the precision electroweak data available in spring 1999 . in the summer 1999",
    "update  @xcite , the values 0.881(20 ) , 0.905(26 ) were given for the lep , sld average values , respectively , of @xmath0 .",
    "a fit to the combined lep+sld data for @xmath19 and @xmath0 , similar to those shown if figs.(5 - 7 ) of this paper , yielded the values ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in the most recent data , the significance of the @xmath0 deviation has increased to 2.9@xmath1 .",
    "finally , the deviation in @xmath0 although interesting , and possibly suggestive of new physics  @xcite is still of only marginal statistical significance .",
    "if there is no fresh data from sld it may be some decades before it is known for sure if the effective couplings of the b quarks are , or are not , in agreement with the sm predictions !      99 the lep collaborations aleph , delphi , l3 , opal , the lep electroweak working group and the sld heavy flavour group.`a combination of preliminary measurements and constraints on the standard model ' ( ewwgr ) , cern - ppe/96 - 183 ( 1996 ) .",
