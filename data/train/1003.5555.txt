    "time explicit schemes are prone to the courant - friedriech - lewy ( cfl ) stability condition which constrains the maximum time step one can use in numerical calculations .",
    "however , in some stellar physics problems , the physical solution evolves on time - scales which are much longer than this `` numerical '' time - scale .",
    "this often makes calculations too cumbersome to be tractable .",
    "it is then necessary to use an implicit scheme , which does not have such a limitation on the time step .",
    "this paper describes such an implicit hydrodynamic code .",
    "the first scientific problem to be adressed with the code is the role of convection in pulsating stars .",
    "this requires an implicit approach since the typical cfl time step ( for a moderate resolution ) is @xmath0 s , whereas the convection ( eddy turnover ) time - scale is @xmath1 s ( @xmath2 ) and typical pulsation periods are of the order of a few days ( @xmath3 s ) with a growth rate of the order of @xmath4 s.",
    "we solve numerically the standard hydrodynamic conservation equations with radiative transfer .",
    "we use the internal energy density equation and we treat radiation transport in the diffusion limit . this approximation is suitable for optically thick region but becomes inaccurate in the photosphere and optically thin regions . molecular viscosity is negligible in astrophysical flow , but we use artificial viscosity when robustness might be an issue , e.g. for the initial relaxation of stellar models or for shocks .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are closed with an equation of state and opacities appropriate for the description of stellar interior structure .",
    "we use spherical coordinates and assume azimuthal symmetry , leaving @xmath5 as independent coordinates .",
    "the spatial discretization is done on a staggered grid , using a finite volume approach .",
    "fluxes are computed at cell interfaces with an upwind reconstruction scheme : we use either the donor cell method ( first order in space ) or the van leer method ( second order in space ) . for the implicit temporal discretization ,",
    "we use either the backward euler scheme ( first order in time ) or the crank - nicholson scheme ( second order in time ) .",
    "an implicit discretization results in a non - linear system which is solved by newton - raphson iterations .",
    "this requires the inversion of a linear system involving the jacobian matrix of the set of equations . here the jacobian matrix is computed by numerical differencing and we use a direct solver , mumps ( amestoy et al .",
    "2001 ) , which implements an efficient and robust lu decomposition .",
    "the variable time step is chosen on empirical ground , depending on the amount of changes of variables during a time step , as described for example in dorfi ( 1997 ) .",
    "for test purpose , we have also implemented in the code cartesian geometry ( 2d ) and the equation of state of a perfect gas with a constant adiabatic index @xmath6 .",
    "basic tests ( e.g. sedov , sod , barenblatt ) have been successfully done for code validation during its first stages of development , so we focus here on two tests more relevant to stellar physics problems such as convection or oscillations .",
    ".run parameters for the entropy bubble test [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented a new multi - d hydrodynamic implicit code . as shown in section [ bubble ] ,",
    "high cfl simulations are efficient to study physical processes proceeding on time - scale larger than the cfl limit .",
    "one should always consider numerical results with care , as an inappropriate time step can give significantly wrong results .",
    "we have shown that the code is able to handle strong convection , at least in a simple setup .",
    "our first results on a realistic ( weakly convective ) stellar model are encouraging and provide very promising perspectives for the first multi - d simulations of convection in pulsating star , a challenge in the field of asteroseismology .",
