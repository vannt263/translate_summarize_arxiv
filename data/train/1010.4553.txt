    "the attraction between two parallel neutral perfectly conducting plates separated by a gap was first predicted by casimir in 1948 @xcite .",
    "this force was explained in terms of quantum vacuum fluctuations and is a well known result in quantum field theory @xcite . for two plates made of an arbitrary material lifshitz",
    "@xcite derived a more general theory for dispersive forces based on rytov s formalism for fluctuating electromagnetic fields @xcite . solving maxwell s equations with the proper boundary conditions , and using the fluctuation dissipation theorem ,",
    "the force can be written in terms of the reflection coefficients between the gap and the slabs .",
    "lifshitz theory is applicable at any temperature and separation between the bodies , with the restriction that the separation between the bodies be larger than the atomic separation . for short separations",
    "the lifshitz formula gives the non retarded van der waals force . at large separations retardation",
    "is included in the theory giving the casimir force .",
    "the success of the lifshitz formula is evident from the variety of systems that have been studied ranging from ferromagnets@xcite , semiconductors @xcite and metamaterials @xcite .",
    "renewed interest in the casimir force came from measurements made in the mid 90 s .",
    "lamoreaux @xcite using a torsional balance and mohideen @xcite with an atomic force microscope did the first precise measurements of the casimir force . later the use of micro torsional balances was implemented by several authors @xcite . with the exception of one experiment @xcite , all the measurements are between a large sphere and a plane rather than between two parallel plates .",
    "recently possible measurements of the casimir force between a plane and a cylinder have been considered @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that dispersive forces could play an important role in the operation of micro electro mechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite .",
    "experiments show that casimir forces have a strong influence on the oscillatory behavior of microstructures , driving them into their nonlinear modes @xcite .",
    "the study of the of casimir and van der waals forces in mems , in particular its role in pull - in dynamics has been also a topic of intensive study @xcite .",
    "a possibility that has been considered by the authors @xcite is the use of external magnetic fields to decrease the magnitude of the casimir force , and thus inhibiting the pull - in or jump to contact .",
    "lifshitz theory was developed for isotropic media .",
    "when anisotropic media are considered , an additional effect was shown to occur , there is a torque associated with the dispersive forces . in 1972 parsegian and weiss @xcite derived an expression for the van der waals energy between anisotropic slabs in the general case when the medium between the slabs was also anisotropic .",
    "the resulting free energy depends on the angle between the principal axes of the slabs resulting in a torque .",
    "later , barash @xcite extended these results to include retardation effects predicting the casimir torque . in the non retarded limit",
    "the results of parsegian and weiss were recovered .    at the molecular level",
    ", the influence of structural chirality on van der waals forces between two solids has been studied by introducing an helical space variation of the dielectric tensor @xcite .",
    "this work was motivated by the need to understand the macroscopic properties of optically active species .",
    "different techniques have been used to derive the expression for the van der waals torque .",
    "for example , zhoa @xcite calculated the casimir torque using the method of quantized surface modes techniques , extending their results to anisotropic metamaterials @xcite .",
    "philbin and leonhardt @xcite calculated the electromagnetic stress tensor between anisotropic plates to obtain the same expression for the casimir torque .",
    "the casimir torque has also been derived as a consequence of angular momentum transfer of the fluctuating electromagnetic fields between the two anisotropic planes @xcite .",
    "although dispersive torques have not been measured , munday @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite made detailed calculations of the casimir torque , and proposed an experiment to measured the torque between a barium titanate disk immersed in ethanol and a second anisotropic material . by means of an external laser the top plate",
    "is initially rotated letting the casimir torque realigning the optical axes of the plates again .",
    "this paper showed that within current experimental techniques , dispersive torques can be measured .    in this paper",
    "we show that a dispersive torque can be induced using a constant magnetic field , and the magnitude of the torque depends on the intensity of the magnetic field .",
    "this is achieved by the excitation of magnetoplasmons in ii - iv semiconductors such as @xmath0 .",
    "when a dc external magnetic field is applied to a metal or a highly doped semiconductor , the normal modes of the free charge change significantly giving rise to magneto plasmons .",
    "for example , the external magnetic field induces an optical anisotropy in an otherwise isotropic material .",
    "also , the dispersion relation of the magneto plasmons presents a frequency gap that depends on the intensity of the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "typically , magnetoplasmons are excited in iii - v semiconductors such as inab , inas or gaas .",
    "magnetoplasmons have reemerge in the context of plasmonics and its applications @xcite .    to illustrate the effect of the external magnetic field ,",
    "consider the classical equation of motion for the electrons in the material : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the effective mass of the electron , @xmath5 the charge and @xmath6 is the relaxation time . assuming an harmonic electric field @xmath7 the current @xmath8 can be found and thus the conductivity can be calculated @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath12 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "the dielectric tensor is obtained from @xmath13 clearly if @xmath14 we recover the results for the isotropic case .    for an arbitrary direction of the magnetic field",
    ", the calculation of the dispersion relation of the surface magneto plasmons and of the optical reflectivity is difficult . to simplify the problem , specific directions of the magnetic field have to be chosen @xcite . in the so called _ faraday _ configuration ,",
    "the magnetic field is perpendicular to the slab . in this case , there is mode conversion upon reflection from the slab .",
    "that is , for an incident te wave , the reflected wave will consist of te and tm modes , similar for an incident tm mode .",
    "the second configuration , that will be used in this paper , is the _",
    "geometry where the magnetic field is parallel to the slabs . in this case",
    "there is no mode conversion upon reflection .",
    "consider a slab parallel to the @xmath15 plane . in the voigt geometry",
    "the external magnetic field points along the @xmath16 axis . in this case , the components of the dielectric tensor are given by @xcite @xmath17 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\epsilon_{yy}&=&\\epsilon_l\\left [ 1-\\frac{(\\omega+i\\gamma)\\omega_p^2}{\\omega(\\omega+i\\gamma)^2-\\omega_c^2 } \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ \\epsilon_{yz}&=&\\epsilon_l\\left [ \\frac{i\\omega_c\\omega_p^2}{\\omega ( ( \\omega+i\\gamma)^2-\\omega_c^2 ) } \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the other components are equal to zero . in these equations @xmath20 is the background dielectric function , @xmath21 the plasma frequency and @xmath22 is the damping parameter .",
    "the factor @xmath20 accounts for the fact that we are working with semiconductors . in the absence of the magnetic field , @xmath23 and",
    "the plates become isotropic . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will use the dimensionless variable @xmath24 , that gives the relative importance of the external magnetic field . in figure",
    "( 2 ) we have plotted the dielectric function components as given by eq . ( 4 ) , for a value of @xmath25 , showing the anisotropy of the system .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , that are typical of @xmath0 @xcite . in this figure",
    "we performed a rotation of the frequency to the complex plane @xmath29 , a common and convenient practice when calculating dispersive forces . for clarity ,",
    "the relation between the values of the parameter @xmath30 and the magnetic field for @xmath0 are presented in the appendix .",
    "in this section we briefly review the theory for calculating the torque associated with the casimir force .",
    "we follow the formalism of barash @xcite .",
    "let us consider two anisotropic plates labeled @xmath31 , as depicted in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "their optical axes are not aligned and form an angle @xmath32 .",
    "the dielectric tensors of each plate can be described by    @xmath33    and    @xmath34    in the case of anisotropic plates the free energy of the system depends on the separation between the plates and the angle between their optical axes , this is @xmath35 .",
    "the usual magnitude of the attractive force per unit area is obtained from @xmath36 , and the torque from @xmath37 . although the calculation of the free energy for anisotropic systems is complicated , some simplifications are possible , depending on the separation between the plates and the degree of anisotropy .",
    "the degree of anisotropy is quantified using the relation    @xmath38    for @xmath39 we are in the low anisotropic regime . in figure ( 2 ) , we plot the values of @xmath40 for different values of the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the values of @xmath30 chosen also correspond to magnetic fields attainable in current laboratories . in all cases ,",
    "the anisotropy is small and an approximate expression for the torque is possible in the non retarded regime , and is given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the surface of the plates and @xmath43 is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath44    this expression considers that between the plates there could be a fluid with a dielectric function @xmath45 and that temperature effects are not important and the separation @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 .",
    "consider the system depicted in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "let us assume a fixed bottom plate made of @xmath0 and the top plate made of a permanent anisotropic material such as calcite .",
    "the space between both plates is ethanol .",
    "both the calcite , and the liquid between the plates were chosen to compare the effect of an external magnetic field with the torque calculations of ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the dielectric functions of calcite and ethanol are calculated using a two oscillator model with the main absorption contributions coming from the ultraviolet and infrared .",
    "the parameters used are those of ref .",
    "( @xcite ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ torque],[barw ] ) we calculate the torque for different values of @xmath30 keeping the plate separation fixed at @xmath48 @xmath49 . in figure ( 4 ) we show the torque per unit area ( @xmath50 ) . as the value of @xmath30 increases ,",
    "does so the torque .",
    "increasing @xmath30 can be achieved by increasing the magnetic field , or by keeping the magnetic field constant and decreasing the number of carriers ( see appendix ) .",
    "the dependence of the torque on the applied magnetic field can be also seen in figure ( 5 ) . in this figure , we present the torque per unit area as a function of @xmath30 keeping the angle between the plates fixed at @xmath51 .",
    "the top curve is for a separation between the plates of @xmath52 @xmath53 and the bottom curve for a separation of @xmath54 @xmath53 .",
    "we have presented calculations of the casimir torque , between two parallel plates , induced by an external magnetic fields in the voigt configuration . as a case study , we calculated the torque between calcite and @xmath0 with the space between the slabs filled with ethanol .",
    "at zero magnetic field there is no torque since the @xmath0 slab is isotropic .",
    "applying an external magnetic field induces an optical anisotropy , inducing a torque .",
    "this system allows a direct comparison with previous calculations and suggested experiments of ref.(@xcite ) , thus showing the viability also of measuring the van der waals torque induced by an external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic fields needed to induce the torque are easily obtained in current laboratories .",
