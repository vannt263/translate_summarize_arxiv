    "the data for this analysis used a tagged photon beam produced via bremsstrahlung , a liquid hydrogen cryotarget , and the clas detector system , during the `` @xmath12 '' experimental run - period  @xcite at jefferson lab .",
    "the reaction of interest was @xmath13 , where the @xmath11 subsequently decays via @xmath2 ( charged - mode , @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( neutral - mode , @xmath16 ) .",
    "for the charged - mode , the outgoing proton and @xmath17 are detected and the @xmath18 is re - constructed as the total missing momenta . for the neutral - mode , the @xmath19",
    "is reconstructed from its decay into a @xmath20 pair , and the @xmath21 is reconstructed as the total missing momenta . therefore the two reaction topologies can be summed up as : @xmath22 where the undetected final - state particles are denoted within parentheses . for background removal ,",
    "a confidence level cut from a kinematic fit to the above reaction topologies , followed by standard timing cuts , were applied . for the neutral - topology ,",
    "a @xmath23  gev cut was placed for @xmath19 identification . for the charged - mode , between @xmath6 and 2.2  gev",
    ", kinematic overlap occurs with the @xmath24 reaction so that a @xmath25  mev cut was placed for @xmath7 removal .",
    "next , independent signal - background separation fits were performed in localized regions of phase - space  @xcite that gave a quality - factor ( @xmath26-value ) for each event , representing the probability of that event being a good signal .",
    "to take the finite width of the @xmath11 into account , the signal function was chosen as a voigtian with a mass - dependent decay width @xmath27 , while the background shape was kept to be as general as possible .",
    "our final @xmath26-value weighted @xmath11 data yields were @xmath28  0.475  million and @xmath28  0.101  million for the charged- and neutral - mode , respectively .",
    "to calculate detector acceptance , 100  million `` raw '' monte carlo @xmath29 events were generated flat in phase - space and passed through gsim , a geant based detector simulator . to incorporate the effect of any physics in the acceptance calculation , next",
    ", the production amplitude was expanded in an over - complete basis of @xmath30-channel @xmath31 waves and an event - based partial wave analysis ( pwa ) fit was performed employing the extented maximum likelihood method  @xcite . based on the results of this pwa fit ,",
    "physics - weighted _ acceptance was calculated subsequently .",

    "[ fig : dcs ] shows our preliminary differential cross sections in a forward angle bin for both the charged- ( red circles ) and neutral - mode ( blue triangles ) .",
    "the @xmath32  gev `` bump '' seen in the previous leps data  @xcite is prominent .",
    "it is interesting to note that this structure appears in both the charged- _ and _ the neutral - mode signifying that an interference between the @xmath7 and @xmath35 channels , as in the case of the charged - mode  @xcite , can not be the predominant cause behind this .",
    "it is possible , however , that the two channels couple ( rescattering effect ) and it does not matter whether the @xmath11 subsequently decays via the charged- or the neutral - mode . we also note here that ref .  @xcite ascribes this structure to an @xmath30-channel resonance .",
    "previous world data for the the @xmath11 is generally very scarce and the few data that exist have wide energy bins and limited statistics .",

    "for a vector meson decaying into spin-0 pseudoscalar mesons , the polarization content is given in terms of four spin density matrices @xmath42 , @xmath43  @xcite . with an unpolarized beam , as in the current experiment , only the @xmath0 elements can be measured . a long puzzle in vector meson photoproduction",
    "has been that while the pomeron exchange process occurs in the @xmath44-channel , helicity conservation seems to occur in the @xmath30-channel instead  @xcite . in the donnachie - landshoff ( dl )",
    "model where the pomeron has a @xmath45 coupling , @xmath30-channel helicity can be explained somewhat in the limit of massless quarks , but there is no _ fundamental _ reason to expect either @xmath44- or @xmath30-channel helicity conservation ( tchc and schc , respectively ) . for schc ( tchc ) , the @xmath46 element has be zero in the helicity ( gottfried - jackson ) frame , so any deviation from this indicates helicity non - conservation .",
    "the recent clas @xmath10 data  @xcite shows that both tchc and schc are broken and the present results indicate the same trend for the @xmath11 . fig .",
