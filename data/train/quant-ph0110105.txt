    "any interferometric setup is devised to reveal minute perturbations to a given configuration .",
    "such perturbations may be induced by the environment or by the action of a given device . in an interferometer ,",
    "the internal quantum operation is monitored by probing the output state , which , in turn , results from the evolution of a given input . by suitably choosing the input signal and the detection stage one optimizes the interferometric measurement .",
    "optimization has two main goals : i ) to maximize the probability of revealing a perturbation , when it occurs , and ii ) to minimize the value of the smallest perturbation that can be effectively detected .",
    "in essence , any interferometric scheme may be viewed as a binary communication system @xcite , with the perturbation playing the role of the encoded information . in order to see",
    "better this analogy let us consider the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ f : schemes]a .",
    "a source s of quantum state prepares the input signal , say @xmath0 , which travels along the interferometer , and it is eventually measured by some detector , denoted by d. the detector is described by an operator - valued probability measure ( povm ) @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the manifold describing the possible detection outcomes . inside the interferometer we a have generic quantum device , which may or may not perturb the signal , _",
    "i.e. _ it performs the quantum operation described by the unitary @xmath4 .",
    "if a perturbation occurs the signal is modified and , at the output , we have the state @xmath5 .",
    "the aim of the detection stage is to discriminate between @xmath0 and its perturbed version @xmath6 .",
    "an optimized interferometer is a device that is able to tell which @xmath7 , for @xmath8 as small as possible .",
    "posed in this way , interferometry is naturally viewed as a binary decision problem , and the detection stage can be described by a two - value povm @xmath9 , which corresponds to the two possible inferences .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to demonstrate the benefits of entanglement in binary interferometry .",
    "we will show that distinguishability of the two hypothesis ( @xmath10 : nothing happened and @xmath11 : a perturbation has occurred ) can be improved by : i ) using an input signal which is entangled with another subsystem , and ii ) measuring the two systems jointly at the output of the interferometer ( see fig .",
    "[ f : schemes]b ) .    in order to optimize the detection strategies , and to show the benefits of entanglement",
    ", we will make use of results and methods from quantum detection theory applied to binary decision @xcite .",
    "this approach is particularly useful for our purposes , since it does not refer to any specific detection scheme for the final stage of the interferometer , but rather , owing to its generality , it allows to find the ultimate quantum limits to interferometry for specific classes of quantum signals .",
    "in the next section , in order to establish notation , we briefly review the neyman - pearson approach to quantum binary decision , and state a lemma about minimum input - output overlap .",
    "then , in section [ s : core ] we apply these results to the interferometric detection of perturbations induced by the most relevant operations in quantum optics such as displacement , squeezing , mixing and phase - shifting .",
    "as we will see , entanglement - assisted interferometers provide better discrimination than conventional schemes . in section [",
    "s : diff ] we analyze an interferometric configuration that achieves , for the quantum operations discussed in section [ s : core ] , the ultimate bounds to precision . finally , in section [ s : outro ] we close the paper with some concluding remarks",
    "the problem that we are facing is to decide among two hypotheses @xmath10 and @xmath12 about the state of a system , which is described by a density operator @xmath7 on the hilbert space of the system . to each hypotheses",
    "it will correspond a different density operator as follows @xmath13 of course , there are many different measurements which can provide information about the state of the system : each of them , however , can be recast mathematically as a two - value povm , corresponding to the two possible inferences @xmath10 and @xmath12 , namely @xmath14 one then needs an optimization strategy in order to determine the most reliable measurement discriminating between the two states .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath6 are orthogonal i.e. @xmath15 the solution is trivial , since @xmath16 is the projection into any subspace that contains the support of @xmath0 and is orthogonal to the support of @xmath6 , and @xmath17 is simply the complement @xmath18 . in most cases of interest , however , the states are not orthogonal and one has to apply an optimization strategy .",
    "since interferometric schemes are frequently used for detecting low - rate events , we may want to look for a strategy that keeps a low - rate of false alarm , namely of wrong inference of perturbation occurrence .",
    "for this purpose , it is suitable to adopt a so - called neyman - pearson ( np ) detection strategy , which consists in fixing a tolerable value of the false - alarm probability @xmath19the probability of inferring that the state of the system is @xmath6 while it is actually @xmath0and then maximizing the detection probability @xmath20 , i.e. the probability of a correct inference of hypothesis @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "it has been proved by helstrom @xcite and holevo @xcite that this problem can be solved by diagonalizing the operator @xmath21 @xmath22 playing the role of a lagrange multiplier accounting for the bound of fixed false alarm probability . according to @xcite",
    "the optimal povm is the one in which @xmath17 is the projection onto the eigenspaces of ( [ lambda ] ) relative to positive eigenvalues and @xmath23 .",
    "unfortunately , the diagonalization of ( [ lambda ] ) is generally not easy .",
    "however , when @xmath24 and @xmath25 are pure states it can be easily solved analytically , by expanding @xmath26 and @xmath27 on the eigenvectors of the difference operator ( [ lambda ] ) . in this way one can evaluate both @xmath19 and @xmath20 versus @xmath22 , and after eliminating @xmath22 from their expressions one obtains @xmath28 ^ 2 &         \\text{for $ 0\\leq q_0\\leq |\\kappa|^2$,}\\cr   1 & \\text{for $ |\\kappa|^2 < q_0\\leq1$.}\\cr}\\label{detection}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 while keeping a low false alarm probability . on the contrary , when the overlap approaches @xmath30 one is forced to decrease the detection probability in order to keep the false alarm probability small .",
    "the optimal choice of the probe that minimizes the overlap , depends on the eigenvalues of the unitary operation @xmath4 . in order to illustrate this ,",
    "let us expand @xmath4 in terms of its eigenvectors @xmath31 ( with integrals replacing sums in case of continuous spectrum ) and let s denote by @xmath32 the minimum overlap between the two possible outputs , as obtained by varying the probe state .",
    "then we have the following _ overlap lemma _",
    "@xcite : the minimum overlap @xmath33 is given by the distance from the origin in the complex plane of the polygon whose vertices are the eigenvalues of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the overlap is either zero ( if the polygon includes the origin ) or it is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angular spread of the eigenvalues .",
    "zero overlap can be achieved with a probe state that is given by a superposition of at least three eigenvectors of @xmath4 , corresponding to eigenvalues that make a polygon that encloses the origin ( or , if they exist , by a superposition of two of them corresponding to diametrically opposed eigenvalues ) . instead ,",
    "if the minimum overlap is not zero , it is achieved by the optimal probe state given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "in this section we compare the performances of single - mode ( fig .",
    "[ f : schemes]a ) and entanglement - assisted interferometric schemes ( fig . [",
    "f : schemes]b ) in the detection of small perturbations induced by relevant quantum optical operations such as displacement , squeezing , mixing and phase - shifting .",
    "the comparison is made in terms of the detection sensitivity , namely , upon parametrizing the `` size '' of the perturbation  whence the corresponding output state  by a coupling parameter @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , the comparison is made in terms of the minimum detectable value @xmath38 of @xmath8 corresponding to output states that can be effectively discriminated while keeping the _ acceptance ratio _",
    "@xmath39 of the np strategy large , namely @xmath40 .",
    "we will call the quantity @xmath41 the `` sensitivity '' of the interferometric scheme . using eq .",

    "this can be seen by writing the displacement as @xmath44 , @xmath45 being the quadrature operator , and @xmath46 .",
    "since the spectrum of the quadrature coincides with the real axis , the spectrum of @xmath47 covers the whole unit circle , and , therefore , the states @xmath26 and @xmath48 can be discriminated with certainty either by choosing @xmath26 as the eigenstate of the conjugated quadrature @xmath49 , or , according to the overlap lemma , as a superposition of at least two eigenstates of the quadrature @xmath50 .",
    "unfortunately , such optimal states are unphysical , since they are not normalizable and have infinite energy .",

    "it is worth noticing that the experimental measurement of a modulated absorption based on entanglement - assisted difference - photocurrent detection has been already performed using the entangled beam exiting an amplifier above threshold ( parametric oscillator , opo ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the effect of entanglement on the interferometric estimation of relevant quantum optical parameters such as displacing and squeezing amplitudes or interferometric phase - shift .",
    "we have evaluated the minimum detectable perturbation according to the neyman - pearson detection strategy , and have shown that entanglement always improves the detection in comparison with conventional schemes . in particular , for the case of estimation of the displacement and the squeezing amplitudes we have shown that the precision of the apparatus that use an entangled probe is independent of the phase of the perturbation , and is therefore more robust and reliable of a simple scheme based on single - mode probe states .",
    "similarly , for the estimation of a two - mode phase - shift , entanglement the interferometer is much more stable when we use a twin beam that when we use squeezed states .",
    "since the neyman - pearson detection strategy does not correspond to a realistic detector , we proposed a feasible interferometric setup that is based on the measurement of the difference photocurrent on an entangled twin - beam .",
    "remarkably , this scheme has the same energy - scaling of the ultimate precision bound , and at the same time is very stable .",
    "we conclude that the technology of entanglement can be of great help in improving precision and stability of quantum interferometers .",
