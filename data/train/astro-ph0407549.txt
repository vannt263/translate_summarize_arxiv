    "the fit yields n ( ) = @xmath240 @xmath78 and b = @xmath241 kms@xmath9 . we expect this result to be an excellent approximation to the actual column density even though the absorber consists of at least two components .",

    "this depression is visible in the top panel of figure  [ fusespec]g .",

    "this value of n ( ) is well within the @xmath51 error estimate of the column density derived from the curve of growth .",

    ". unfortunately , blending with galactic lines obscures some interesting extreme - ultraviolet transitions that would otherwise be observable at this redshift ( e.g. , ) ; we are able to estimate the column density from the @xmath119 line ( see figure  [ o3fig ] ) .",

    "a summary of the column densities is provided in table  [ tab_col13847 ] , together with the analysis methods used to calculate the column densities .",
    "the lines shown in figure  [ stack_ion_13847 ] indicate that there are two components near @xmath17 separated by @xmath256 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the dominant component contains roughly 90% of the total column density of the system , with an effective b - value of @xmath257 kms@xmath9 .",
    "the width of the weaker component is more difficult to ascertain , but it is probably comparable to that of the dominant component .",
    "the dominant component may consist of unresolved sub - components , but we are unable to place strong constraints on the properties of the sub - components with the existing data .",
    "we estimated the column density using a single - component curve of growth , profile fitting , and the apparent optical depth method .",

    "the absorption is confined between about @xmath262 and @xmath263 kms@xmath9 .",
    "they too may contain at least two components as evidenced by the inflection on the positive velocity side of the @xmath220 profile observed by stis . like the low ionization gas , the intermediate ionization gas is probably dominated by the single primary component near 0  kms@xmath9 .",

    "this line has an effective b - value 3 - 5 times that of the lower ionization metal lines ( b  @xmath265 kms@xmath9  vs. b  @xmath266 kms@xmath9 ) .",
    "several factors could contribute to the greater line breadth , including thermal broadening , turbulent motions in the highly ionized gas , and greater spatial extent of the absorbing region .",

    "the total velocity extent of the ( roughly @xmath267 kms@xmath9 , depending upon which fuse or stis data are used ) falls within the velocity range covered by the strong lines .",
    "the wide range of ionization stages observed in the @xmath17 system is strong evidence that the absorber is multi - phase in nature . in particular , the presence of with a large amount of neutral and low ionization gas indicates that the medium probed probably does not have a uniform ionization throughout .",

    "we have considered the possibility that our visual impression is just coincidental and that the absorbers are actually randomly distributed with respect to the galaxies in the direction of pg11116 + 215 . to quantitatively assess this probability , we performed the following simple monte carlo statistical test .",
    "we carried out a large number of simulations in which we randomly distributed a number of absorbers along the sight line equal to the observed number of systems , and then we determined the number of instances in which the simulations by chance showed the same number of absorbers as observed with @xmath454 750 kpc and @xmath455 350 kms@xmath9 . since associated absorption systems with @xmath456 sometimes show strong evidence that the gas is close to the central engine of the qso ( e.g. , hamann & ferland 1999 ; yuan et al .",

    "this indicates that the probability that the observed intervening absorbers toward pg1116 + 215 are randomly distributed with respect to the galaxies is 81/(@xmath463 .",
    "we conclude that it is highly unlikely that the intervening absorbers are randomly distributed with respect to galaxies in the direction of pg1116 + 215 .",
    "however , it is striking how well the two `` associated '' lines toward pg1116 + 215 line up with two of the most pronounced peaks in the galaxy distribution , so one might reasonably argue that the absorbers at @xmath18 and @xmath228 , despite their proximity to the qso redshift , are also intervening .",
    "consequently we have also carried out a monte carlo calculation in which the lines within 5000 km s@xmath9 of @xmath457 were included in the count , and the random distributions were allowed to extend all of the way to the qso redshift . in this second set of monte carlo trials we found that the probability that the lines are randomly distributed was even slightly smaller , @xmath464 .",
