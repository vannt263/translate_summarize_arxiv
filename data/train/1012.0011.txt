    "security is an important consideration in wireless systems due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions . in a pioneering work ,",
    "wyner in @xcite addressed the security problem from an information - theoretic point of view and considered a wiretap channel model .",
    "he proved that secure transmission of confidential messages to a destination in the presence of a degraded wire - tapper can be achieved , and he established the secrecy capacity which is defined as the highest rate of reliable communication from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver while keeping the wire - tapper completely ignorant of the transmitted messages .",
    "recently , there has been numerous studies addressing information theoretic security @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for instance , the impact of fading has been investigated in @xcite , where it has been shown that a non - zero secrecy capacity can be achieved even when the eavesdropper channel is better than the main channel on average .",
    "the secrecy capacity region of the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages and associated optimal power control policies have been identified in @xcite , where it is shown that the transmitter allocates more power as the strength of the main channel increases with respect to that of the eavesdropper channel .",
    "in addition to security issues , providing acceptable performance and quality is vital to many applications .",
    "for instance , voice over ip ( voip ) , interactive - video ( e.g , .",
    "videoconferencing ) , and streaming - video systems are required to satisfy certain buffer or delay constraints , and the recent proliferation and expected widespread use of multimedia applications in next generation wireless systems call for a rigorous performance analysis under such quality of service ( qos ) considerations . a performance measure for these systems",
    "is the effective capacity @xcite , which can be seen as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given time - varying service process can support while satisfying statistical qos constraints imposed in the form of limitations on the buffer length .",
    "effective capacity is recently studied in various wireless scenarios ( see e.g. , @xcite@xcite and references therein ) . for instance , tang and zhang in @xcite considered the effective capacity when both the receiver and transmitter know the instantaneous channel gains , and derived the optimal power and rate adaptation policies that maximize the system throughput under qos constraints .",
    "_ in @xcite considered fixed - rate transmission schemes and analyzed the effective capacity and related resource requirements for markov wireless channel models . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "energy efficiency is addressed when the wireless systems operate under buffer constraints and employ either adaptive or fixed transmission schemes .",
    "the above - mentioned studies addressed the physical - layer security and qos limitations separately .",
    "however , the joint treatment of these considerations is of much interest from both practical and theoretical points of view .",
    "the practical relevance is through , for instance , the wide range of military and commercial applications and scenarios in which sensitive multimedia information needs to be transmitted in a wireless and secure fashion .",
    "the theoretical interest is due to the certain tension that arises when both secrecy and buffer limitations are present .",
    "for instance , physical layer security leads to lower transmission rates .",
    "moreover , the optimal performance in wireless scenarios requires opportunistic transmissions in which one has to wait for high - rate transmission until the main channel between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver is much stronger than the eavesdropper s channel .",
    "note that both end - results may cause buffer overflows and packet losses and may be detrimental in buffer / delay constrained systems . despite these motivating facts , the combination of security and delay / buffer considerations has received only little attention so far . in @xcite , liang _ et al .",
    "_ analyzed the arrival rates supported by a fading wire - tap channel and identified the power allocation policies that take into account the queue lengths . in @xcite , youssef _",
    "_ studied the delay limited secrecy capacity of fading channels .    in this paper , we address both physical - layer security issues and buffer limitations in order to identify the key tradeoffs and optimal transmission strategies .",
    "we assume that perfect channel side information ( csi ) is available at both the transmitter and receivers .",
    "we first consider a secure broadcasting scenario in which the transmitter sends common messages to two receivers and confidential messages to one receiver .",
    "for this case , we define the _ effective secrecy throughput region _ as the region of common and confidential message arrival rates that can be supported when the transmitter operates under constraints on buffer violation probabilities .",
    "then , we investigate the optimal power allocation policies that achieve points on the boundary of the effective secrecy throughput region .",
    "we provide an algorithm to determine the power allocation as a function of the channel states .",
    "subsequently , we provide a more detailed analysis of the special case in which the transmitter sends no common messages . in this case , the broadcast channel with confidential messages is reduced to a wiretap channel . in this scenario ,",
    "we provide the expression for the effective secure throughput and analyze two types of control policies by adapting the power with respect to both the main and eavesdropper channel conditions and also with respect to only the main channel conditions . through this analysis , we find that , due to the introduction of the buffer constraints , the transmitter can not reserve its power for times at which the main channel is much stronger than the eavesdropper channel . also , we find that adapting the power allocation strategy with respect to both the main and eavesdropper channel csi rather than only the main channel csi provides little improvement when qos constraints become more stringent .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii briefly describes the system model and the necessary preliminaries on statistical qos constraints and effective capacity . in section iii , the effective secrecy throughput region and the corresponding optimal power allocation policies are presented for fading broadcast channels with confidential messages . in section iv ,",
    "the special case in which the common message rate is zero is studied in more detail .",
    "finally , section v concludes the paper .",
    "as depicted in figure [ fig : systemmodel ] , we consider a system with one transmitter and two receivers .",
    "we assume that the transmitter sends confidential messages to receiver 1 . from this perspective",
    ", receiver 2 can be regarded as an eavesdropper .",
    "however , receiver 2 is not necessarily a malicious eavesdropper as we also consider a broadcast scenario in which transmitter sends common messages to both receivers .    in the model ,",
    "data sequences generated by the source are divided into frames of duration @xmath0 .",
    "these data frames are initially stored in the buffer before they are transmitted over the wireless channel .",
    "the channel input - output relationships are given by @xmath1=h_1[i]x[i]+w_1[i ] \\intertext{and } y_2[i]=h_2[i]x[i]+w_2[i]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the symbol index , @xmath3 $ ] is the channel input in the @xmath2th symbol duration , and @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] represent the channel outputs at receivers 1 and 2 , respectively .",

    "also , we denote the instantaneous transmit power in the @xmath2th frame as @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "now , the instantaneous transmitted snr level for receiver 1 becomes @xmath20=\\frac{p[i]}{n_1 b}$ ] .",
    "then , the average power constraint at the transmitter is equivalent to the average snr constraint @xmath21\\}\\le { { \\text{\\footnotesize{snr}}}}$ ] for receiver 1 @xcite . if we denote the ratio between the noise powers of the two channels as @xmath22 , the instantaneous transmitted snr level for receiver 2 becomes @xmath23=\\gamma\\mu^1[i]$ ] .",
    "we consider a block - fading channel in which the fading coefficients stay constant for the block duration of @xmath0 seconds and change independently across the blocks .",
    "we assume that both the transmitter and receivers have perfect channel side information ( csi ) .",
    "equipped with the channel knowledge , the transmitter employs power control .",
    "we denote the power allocation policies for the common and confidential messages by @xmath24 , respectively , where @xmath25 is the vector composed of the channel states of receivers 1 and 2 .",
    "note that the power control policies are defined as instantaneous power levels normalized by the noise power @xmath26 at receiver 1 , i.e. , @xmath27}{n_1 b}$ ] and @xmath28}{n_1 b}$ ] where @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] are the instantaneous powers of the common and confidential messages as functions of the fading states @xmath31 .",
    "the region of fading states in which confidential messages are transmitted is @xmath32 while the complement of this region in the first quadrant is @xmath33 . in @xmath34 ,",
    "eavesdropper s channel is stronger and instantaneous secrecy capacity is zero .",

    "the maximum instantaneous confidential message rate is given by @xmath43 then , the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the fading broadcast channel with common and confidential messages is @xmath44 the following result shows the convexity of the above capacity region .",

    "the new power control policy can be expressed as @xmath52 since @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we can easily see that @xmath55 , and hence @xmath56 as well .",
    "moreover , this time - sharing strategy achieves @xmath57 with the power control policy @xmath58 .",

    "similarly , if @xmath79 in ( [ eq : inst - secrecyrate ] ) , then @xmath77 is the maximum effective capacity of the confidential messages achieved with the power control policy @xmath40 .",
    "note that in both cases , @xmath74 depends on the fading states @xmath31 , and the expectation in ( [ eq : effectivedefirate ] ) is with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "finally , we denote the effective capacity normalized by bandwidth @xmath13 as @xmath80",
    "in this section , we investigate the secure throughput region of and the optimal power control policies for the fading broadcast channel with confidential messages ( bcc ) in the presence of statistical qos constraints .",
    "hence , in the considered scenario , the transmitter sends common messages to two receivers , sends confidential messages to only one receiver , and operates under buffer constraints .",
    "_ in @xcite showed that the fading channel can be viewed as a set of parallel subchannels with each subchannel corresponding to one fading state .",
    "subsequently , the ergodic secrecy capacity region is determined and the optimal power allocation policies achieving the boundary of the capacity region are identified in @xcite . outage performance is also studied for cases in which long transmission delays can not be tolerated and coding and decoding needs to be performed in one block .      in this paper , we analyze the performance under statistical buffer constraints by considering the effective capacity formulation . using the effective capacity expression in ( [ eq : effectivedefirate ] ) , we first have the following definition for the effective throughput region .    the effective secure throughput region of the fading bcc is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the vector composed of the instantaneous rates for the common and confidential messages , respectively .",

    "moreover , in ( [ eq : securethroughputregion ] ) , @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the effective capacities of common and confidential messages , respectively .    since the ergodic secrecy capacity region is convex as proved in proposition [ prop : convexity - ergodic ]",
    ", we can easily prove the following .",
    "[ prop : convexity - effcap ] the effective secrecy throughput region @xmath88 defined in ( [ eq : securethroughputregion ] ) is convex .    _",

    "for instance , the expression in ( [ eq : convexityproof1 ] ) denotes a vector whose components are @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "the inequality in ( [ eq : convexityproof3 ] ) follows from hlder s inequality .",
