    "this paper addresses a conjecture of cox and durrett @xcite concerning interfaces naturally arising in supercritical contact processes on @xmath4 .",
    "the contact process on @xmath5 is a spin system with operator @xmath6 where @xmath7 and flip rates @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 for @xmath10 and probability kernel @xmath11 .    in the following , we take @xmath11 to have finite range ( that is , @xmath12 for @xmath13 ) and to be symmetric , though this latter hypothesis can be dispensed with via the techniques and results of bezuidenhout and gray @xcite",
    ".    often the contact process is used as a model of the spread of an infection and a configuration @xmath14 represents the state where there is an infection at @xmath15 if and only if @xmath16 .",
    "we will adopt this point of view and speak of a site @xmath17 being _ infected _ at time @xmath3 ( for a process @xmath18 if @xmath19 .",

    "thus , for two configurations @xmath23 and @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 under the natural partial order , it is possible to construct in a single probability space two processes , @xmath26 starting at @xmath27 and @xmath28 starting at @xmath24 , satisfying , with probability one , @xmath29 for all @xmath3 .",
    "a consequence is that @xmath30 such that for @xmath31 , the invariant limit @xmath32 is a non - trivial measure and for @xmath33 , this limit is @xmath34 .",
