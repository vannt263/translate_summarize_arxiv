    "since quantum phase transitions occur as a function of external control parameters at strictly zero temperature @xcite , when considering many - particle systems one is often tempted to restrict the theoretical treatment to a single quantum state  the ground state .",
    "in fact , according to a widely employed definition @xcite , any non - analytic behavior of the ground state energy under smooth changes of the external control parameter in an infinitely extended lattice is considered a quantum phase transition .",

    "crossings are however hardly specific to the ground state . inasmuch as these are the expression of fundamental changes in the structural properties of the system  as in the above classical understanding of phase transitions  and not just the consequence of a perturbation - induced , local coupling between isolated pairs of states",
    ", one should in general expect dramatic structural changes throughout the entire spectrum , in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition . indeed , quantum phase transitions are often accompanied @xcite by chaotic level statistics @xcite , which can lead to rich dynamics in the vicinity of the critical point @xcite .",
    "moreover , level clusterings in the excited states @xcite or in quasienergy states of driven systems @xcite have been identified as analogs of quantum phase transitions . however , a compelling general connection between the rearrangement of excited - state levels and the ground - state quantum phase transition is still lacking .    in this work",

    "a flat dispersion relation was also noted for the configurations in the preceding sections in the absence of a magnetic field , see figs .",
    "[ fig.energyferro]a ) and [ fig.energyferroexcited]a ) . for the configuration considered here ,",
    "the rotation @xmath390 was able to remove the alternating phases , which allowed us to describe the hamiltonian in terms of a single bosonic species .",
    "if this is not the case , a unit cell with several kinds of bogoliubov bosons is required for the description of fluctuations around intermediate energy states . for completeness , in appendix  [ appendixa ]",
    "we discuss the case of a lattice with two different types of bosons per unit cell .",
    "a careful analysis of the two - species scenario at a saddle - point configuration of the semiclassical energy  ( [ eq.meanfieldpbc ] ) is beyond the scope of the present paper . due to the dynamical instability",
    ", such a configuration would lead to a complex energy spectrum and the breakdown of the second - order expansion  ( [ eq : hamtaylors ] ) at long times .",
    "to summarize , a semiclassical energy landscape was derived by a variational ansatz in terms of spin - coherent states , and , equivalently , as the lowest - order term of a formal @xmath3-expansion . employing a series of single - parameter spin configurations",
    ", we produced one - dimensional projections of this @xmath2-dimensional energy landscape .",
    "this provided a simple semiclassical approximation of the full quantum spectrum , which is exact for vanishing or very strong external fields  independently of the length @xmath0 of the spins , and of the interaction range .",
    "as the strength of the external field is increased , each of the mean - field signatures of the semiclassical excited - state levels exhibits a bifurcation . in the case of the ground state , the bifurcation of the energy landscape",
    "is directly related to the broken symmetry characterizing the ferromagnetic phase .    by studying the spin - wave fluctuations about the semiclassical energy for a selection of spin - configurations , we identified quantum signatures of the bifurcation of the energy landscape in the dispersion relations of spin waves around some of the excited states .",
    "furthermore , in the semiclassical limit @xmath391 , a closing excitation gap of the elementary excitations around the ground state predicts the exact magnetic field at which a quantum bifurcation occurs for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq.spinchains ] ) of an arbitrary number @xmath2 of long spins with tunable - range interactions .",
    "interestingly , our model allows us to explore the semiclassical and the thermodynamic limits separately and in a controlled fashion . for a finite number of sites @xmath2",
    ", the semiclassical limit is reached by allowing for a large number @xmath19 of non - interacting elementary spins at each site .",
    "the thermodynamic limit , in turn , is approached by increasing the number @xmath2 of interacting , composite spins . for finite @xmath0",
    ", we observe a quantum phase transition in the thermodynamic limit , which , e.g. , includes the well - known transition of the ising model for @xmath1 and @xmath24 .",
    "this quantum phase transition occurs among the @xmath392 _ composite _ spins of length @xmath0 , whose interaction range is characterized by @xmath22 . for finite interaction ranges ( @xmath186 ) ,",
    "semiclassical mean - field methods typically fail to make quantitative predictions close to criticality .",
    "conversely , in the semiclassical limit the @xmath393 _ elementary _ spins , which are always concentrated in a single point , can be represented by few effective degrees of freedom , whose spectral spread depends on @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , in the semiclassical limit , the mean - field prediction becomes exact for all values of @xmath2 and @xmath22 .",
    "the observed non - analytic phenomena are referred to as quantum bifurcations , since they are direct quantum signatures of the bifurcation of the semiclassical energy landscape . the long - range interacting spin-@xmath0 model with transverse field , eq .",
    "( [ eq.spinchains ] ) , thus provides a family of hamiltonians which exhibit both quantum bifurcations and quantum phase transitions .",
    "previously studied phase transitions in models with infinite connectivity @xcite , such as the lipkin - meshkov - glick @xcite or the dicke model @xcite , according to the definition presented here , are to be identified as quantum bifurcations rather than as quantum phase transitions .",
    "one advantage of the semiclassical limit @xmath391 is that for a small number @xmath2 of sites , one could perform a complete semiclassical analysis in terms of trajectories in phase space .",
    "for example , for a system with @xmath394 , one could find all the critical points of the energy landscape of eq .  .",
