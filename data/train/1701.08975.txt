    "seismic electric signals ( ses)@xcite are low frequency @xmath4 changes of the electric field of the earth , that have been found to precede earthquakes with lead times ranging from several hours to a few months@xcite .",
    "they are emitted when the gradually increasing stress before an earthquake reaches a critical value @xcite in which the electric dipoles formed due to point defects@xcite in the future focal area that affect the usual dielectric properties@xcite exhibit cooperative orientation , thus leading to an emission of a transient electric signal . upon analysing these signals in a new time domain termed natural time@xcite",
    ", they can be distinguished@xcite from other electric signals of different origin , e.g. , signals emitted from man - made electrical sources . the latter",
    "are hereafter called `` artificial '' signals .",
    "in general , the analysis in natural time may uncover properties hidden in complex time - series@xcite .",
    "in particular , for the case of ses , the natural time analysis of the small earthquakes subsequent to a series of ses , termed ses activity@xcite , may identify the occurrence time of the impending mainshock@xcite .    for a time - series consisting of _ n _ events , the natural time can be defined@xcite as @xmath5 and it serves as an index for the occurrence of the _ k_-th event .",
    "we study@xcite the evolution of the pair ( @xmath6 ) where @xmath7 is a quantity proportional to the energy released in the _ k_-th event . for a signal of dichotomous nature ,",
    "@xmath7 is proportional to the duration of the _ k_-th event ; otherwise , the quantity @xmath7 is determined@xcite by means of the instantaneous power @xmath1 .",
    "the normalized power spectrum is introduced as@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 . as @xmath11 eq .",
    "gives some useful statistical properties .",
    "for example , it has been shown@xcite that @xmath12 which for an ses activity leads to@xcite the variance of @xmath13 hereafter labelled @xmath14 : @xmath15 other parameters we take under consideration are the entropy _ s _ in natural time given by@xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the entropy under time reversal @xmath18 , where the effect of the time - reversal operator @xmath19 on @xmath7 is given by@xcite @xmath20 which positions the first pulse ( k=1 ) as last in the new time reversed time - series etc .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that an ses activity obeys the inequalities : @xmath21 where @xmath22 the entropy of the uniform distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the relations and , which involve the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are used in order to classify as ses an electric signal of short duration after eliminating its sinusoidal background , termed magnetotelluric@xcite background .",
    "this background comprises electrical variations induced by frequent small variations of the earth s magnetic field originated from extraterrestrial sources .",
    "an example of an electric signal analysis following the procedure described above will be given below in section iii .",
    "the huang - hilbert transform@xcite shortly reviewed in section [ hh ] is a novel method used in the analysis of non - stationary time - series by computing instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "one of its components is the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) which decomposes a signal into some functions called intrinsic mode functions ( imf ) that , in combination with the hilbert transform , can give information about the spectrum of the signal .",
    "it is the scope of the present paper to study the application of the huang - hilbert transform@xcite to ses activities of short duration by considering also natural time analysis . in particular ,",
    "the latter analysis is used for the classification of an ses activity in section [ nt ] , while the imfs of the ses activity are extracted in section [ hhapp ] .",
    "the interconnection of these results is investigated in section [ instamp ] .",
    "specifically , in order to determine which of the imfs represent the ses , we show in section v , that the squared instantaneous amplitudes as derived after the application of the hilbert transform can also be used instead of the instantaneous power for the classification of the electric signal as ses .",
    "the reason we choose to study the instantaneous amplitudes is because , as shown in section v ( in particular see fig .",
    "[ fig : sumsa]c that will be discussed later ) , the instantaneous amplitude of the sum of all the imfs extracted from the signal can approximate the original time - series .",

    "( color online ) the histogram of the signal of fig .",
    "[ fig : shortses1]a and its pdf . ]",
    "the hilbert transform of a function @xmath26 is@xcite : @xmath27\\equiv\\hat{y}(t)=\\frac{1}{\\pi}pv\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\frac{x(\\tau)}{t-\\tau}d\\tau\\ ] ] where @xmath28 indicates the cauchy principal value . the original time - series and its hilbert transform are the real and imaginary part respectively of an analytic function @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 stand for the instantaneous amplitudes .",
    "an imf should satisfy two conditions@xcite : first , the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings must be equal or differ at most by one .",
    "second , the mean value of the envelopes defined by the local maxima and minima is zero . if we apply the hilbert transform to the imfs we derive the instantaneous amplitudes @xmath0 which will be used later for the analysis of the signal in natural time .    in order to begin the emd ( the process which extracts the imfs ) the signal has to have at least two extrema@xcite .",
    "if there are not any extrema then the signal can be differentiated to reveal them . finally , the characteristic time scale is defined by the time lapse between the extrema and not the zero crossings .",

    "+ d ) the sifting process starts anew treating the component @xmath34 as the data and a new component @xmath36 is derived etc . + this process will stop when one of the @xmath34 components satisfies the definition of an imf ( zero mean value , the number of extrema and zero crossings is equal or differ at most by one )",
    ". the first imf will be the last @xmath34 component extracted .",

    "the original signal can be recomposed using the following relation @xmath39 where _ trend _ stands for the last imf . when the final residual is a monotonic function the process stops .",

    "it was recorded at a measuring station located close to volos city , greece , on november 21 , 2012 and preceded the @xmath40=4.6 earthquake with an epicentre at 38.26@xmath41n , 22.22@xmath41e that occurred on april 28 , 2013 .",
