    "cellular automata are one of the simplest mathematical models for nonlinear dynamics to produce complicated patterns of behaviour , which had been originally introduced by von neumann@xcite .",
    "wolfram had reintroduced cellular automata as a model to investigate complexity and randomness@xcite .",
    "he investigated many fundamental features of them@xcite . since then many authors have made efforts to clarify the properties of cellular automata and applied to natural systems@xcite .",
    "one - dimensional cellular automata are described by the discrete time evolution of site @xmath0 : @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 takes @xmath2 discrete values over @xmath3 . the simplest model , _ elementary cellular automaton _ , consists of sites with two internal states over @xmath4 interacting with the nearest neighbour sites ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "wolfram introduced a naming scheme for these models and classified the behaviour of cellular automata into four classes@xcite .",
    "most authors have worked on cellular automata within the scope of the infinite number of sites .",
    "a few works have concerned periodic boundary condition ( cylindrical automata)@xcite . in our previous paper@xcite ( referred as paper i ) we had investigated the periodic orbits of finite rule-90 cellular automata with dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "we analyzed the eigenvalue equations of the transfer matrices which describe the time evolution of the system . in the present paper",
    "the method is extended to the rule-150 case .",
    "some results obtained in paper i will be cited again for completeness .",
    "we review the numerical results obtained in paper i on so - called rule-90 cellular automata following wolfram s naming scheme . the time evolution of the @xmath6-the site @xmath7 @xmath8 is described as a sum modulo 2 of the nearest neighbour sites : @xmath9 we use the dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath10 . in the wolfram s classification",
    "the rule-90 model belongs to the third class which shows the chaotic behaviour .",
    "the time evolution is also expressed by matrix : @xmath11 where @xmath12 describes the state at @xmath13 and the transfer matrix @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 in paper i we had found the periodic structures of the transfer matrices @xmath14 numerically as shown in table  [ periodtable ] .",
    "they are summarized as follows :    @xmath16    for cellular automata with even number of sites ( eq .  ( [ even90 ] ) ) , every state except the null one ( all sites are zero ) is on the orbits with period not exceeding @xmath17 .",
    "the concrete periods depend on the initial states .",
    "the period @xmath17 corresponds to the least common multiple of them , and we call it the maximum period .",

    "some states belong to the orbits with period @xmath17 or less and the others except the null state are drawn to the periodic orbits after some time steps not exceeding the maximum relaxation @xmath19 .",
    "it is very interesting that in the @xmath20 case every state is drawn into the null state after at most @xmath21 steps ( eq .  ( [ special90 ] ) ) . in this case",

    "these eigenvalue equations enable us to find the maximum periods and maximum length of relaxation path to the periodic orbits .",

    ".    finally we study the cases that the lowest powers of polynomials are greater than 0 , namely they have the forms as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a polynomial with a constant term .",
    "the number of null solutions , @xmath64 , corresponds to the maximum length of relaxation path @xmath19 . applying the above procedure to @xmath63",
    ", we obtain the maximum period and shorter ones .",

    ", we find the maximum period @xmath69 .",
    "we also find shorter ones 2 and 1 by factorizing @xmath70 .",
    "a simple recursion relation of the maximum period and maximum length of relaxation are found for rule-90 cellular automata with odd number of sites . the new recursion relation @xmath71 holds by virtue of algebra in @xmath33 .",
    "this gives a simple form @xmath72 .",
    "the maximum period and the maximum length of relaxation path of @xmath73 rule-90 cellular automata are described by those of @xmath74 sites as @xmath75",
    "we investigate the periodic structure of one - dimensional rule-90 and rule-150 cellular automata with dirichlet boundary condition . we find three types of behaviour .",
    "the first is periodic one which appears in cellular automata with even number of sites for rule-90 and @xmath25 for rule-150 .",
    "the second appears in the cases of odd number of sites for rule-90 and @xmath76 for rule-150 .",

    "all states are drawn into the null state within @xmath21 steps .",

    "the maximum period is obtained by finding the minimum power to satisfy @xmath46 .",
    "shorter periods are given by factorizing the eigenvalue polynomials .",
    "the number of null solutions of the polynomials gives the maximum length of relaxation path .",
    "for some special cases , we find the explicit forms of the maximum period .",
    "distribution of periods and relaxation is still not clear .",
    "roots of the eigenvalue equations , in general , are found over the galois extension of finite field@xcite .",
    "for all positive integer @xmath21 there are primitive polynomials @xmath77 of degree @xmath21 over @xmath33 .",
    "one of the roots , @xmath78 , of @xmath77 generates the galois extension @xmath79 , whose elements are @xmath80 and @xmath81 . other roots of @xmath77 are called _ conjugate _ of @xmath78 and generate the _ isomorphic _ galois extensions .",
    "a general polynomial of degree @xmath21 has roots over @xmath79 .",
    "a eigenvalue polynomial has @xmath21 roots @xmath82 .",
    "for instance @xmath49 rule-150 case , the equation @xmath50 has roots in @xmath83 , where @xmath78 is one of roots of forth primitive polynomial @xmath84 .",
    "explicitly the roots are @xmath85 and @xmath86 with multiplicity 2 for each .",
    "the minimum common multiplier of the roots , which satisfies @xmath87 , is @xmath88 .",
    "this seems to suggest the maximum period @xmath89 , namely @xmath90 .",
    "this procedure , however , does not work for other cases .",
    "for example , the eigenvalue polynomial of @xmath91 rule-150 case is @xmath92 .",
    "it can be factorized to @xmath93 and the root is @xmath94 with multiplicity 3 .",
    "the periods , however , are 4 , 2 and 1 . more number theoretical studies are expected .",
    "the elementary cellular automata are also a subject to build a built - in self - test of vlsi@xcite .",
    "usually the shift - registers which generate pseudo - random sequences of length @xmath95 with @xmath21 registers , are used for build - in self - tests .",
    "our results show the elementary cellular automata can also generate exponentially long but not maximum sequences . by fine - tuned mixture of rule-90 and rule-150 cases , _ hybrid cellular automata _ , it is shown to be able to produce a maximum length pseudo - random sequences .",
