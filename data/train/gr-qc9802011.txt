    "an important goal of numerical relativity is to compute the gravitational waveforms generated by systems of compact astrophysical objects such as binary black holes or binary neutron stars . with the prospect that gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , virgo and geo will be on - line in the next few years ,",
    "it is crucial to study numerical relativistic simulations of events which might be observable by these detectors .",
    "such calculations are important not only because they could provide signal templates which would considerably increase the probability of detection , but also because the comparison of such templates with the observations may provide essential astrophysical information on the nature of the emitting sources . the purpose of the binary black hole `` grand challenge '' _ alliance _",
    "@xcite , a multi - institutional collaboration in the united states , is to study the inspiral coalescence of the most significant source of signals for the interferometric gravity wave detectors : a binary black hole system .",
    "central to the goal of determining waveforms generated by astrophysical systems is the need for accurate techniques which compute asymptotic waveforms from numerical relativity simulations on three - dimensional ( 3d ) spacelike hypersurfaces with finite extents . in general ,",
    "the computational domain can not be extended to the distant wave zone @xcite , where the geometric optics approximation is valid . indeed",
    ", computational resource limitations require that the outer boundary of such simulations lies rather close to the highly dynamical and strong field region , where backscatter of waves off curvature can be significant . as a result , it is imperative to develop techniques which can `` extract '' the gravitational waves generated by the simulation and evolve them out to the distant wave zone where they assume their asymptotic form .",
    "while the problem of radiation extraction is important for computing observable waveforms from numerical simulations , careful implementation of outer boundary conditions is also crucial for maintaining the integrity of the simulations themselves , as poorly implemented boundary conditions are a likely source of numerical instabilities .",
    "these outer boundary conditions are also decisive in framing the desired physical context for the simulation , _ e.g. _ , an isolated source in an asymptotically flat spacetime . for typical applications ,",
    "we can summarize the requirements of a radiation - extraction / outer - boundary module as : _ ( a ) _ supporting stable evolution of einstein s equations , _ ( b ) _ minimizing spurious ( numerical ) reflection of radiation at the boundary , _ ( c ) _ providing accurate and numerically convergent approximations to the gravitational waveforms that would be observed in the wave zone surrounding an isolated source , _ ( d ) _ incorporating effects of radiation reflection off background curvature outside the numerical boundary when appropriate ( for example when the outer boundary is in a strong field region ) .",
    "in this paper we present a new method for extracting gravitational waveforms from a 3d numerical relativity code while _ simultaneously _ imposing outer boundary conditions .",
    "our approach is motivated by earlier investigations of gauge - invariant extraction techniques @xcite , but promises to be more generally applicable in cases where the background curvature is significant near the outer boundary of the computational 3d grid .",
    "our method matches a full 3d cauchy solution of einstein s equations on spacelike hypersurfaces with a perturbative one - dimensional ( 1d ) solution in a region where the waveforms can be treated as linear perturbations on a spherically symmetric curved background .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : analysis ] , we describe the mathematical basis of our method and derive the linearized radial wave equations which account for the evolution of the gravitational waves in the perturbative region of the spacetime . in section",
    "[ sec : procimplement ] , we discuss the strategies for the numerical solution of the above equations and present a numerical code we have constructed which represents a general module implementing our extraction / outer boundary method in conjunction with a 3d numerical relativity simulation . in this paper",
    "we focus on tests of the outer boundary module as a self - contained unit using analytic solutions . in companion papers we focus on tests of the module in the practical context of a typical application . in @xcite",
    ", we have presented tests of this outer boundary module in conjunction with the 3d _ `` interior code '' _ of the alliance which evolves einstein equations in the standard `` @xmath0 '' form ( as presented in @xcite ) .",
    "a more thorough discussion of these results is forthcoming @xcite .",
    "einstein s equations are highly nonlinear and when spacetime is characterized by rapidly varying strong fields , the full 3d nonlinear equations must be used . outside of an isolated region of this kind",
    ", however , a perturbative approximation , in which gravitational data are treated as linear perturbations of an exact solution to einstein s equations , may be valid . in this perturbative region a linearized approximation to einstein s equations could then exploited to simplify the evolution of gravitational data .",
    "the idea behind a cauchy - perturbative matching approach is to supplement the computationally expensive evolution of the full einstein equations with the comparatively simpler evolution of the linearized equations in a perturbative region .",
    "figure [ fig : schematic ] provides a schematic picture of the cauchy - perturbative matching approach .",
    "the square region covered by the grid represents the 3d computational domain n ( one dimension is suppressed ) on which cauchy evolution of the full einstein equations is computed .",
    "the dark central area in n includes the strong field highly dynamical region , where the nonlinear einstein equations must be solved .",
    "the medium and light shaded annular area , @xmath1 , represents the perturbative region .",
    "anywhere in the ( medium shaded ) intersection of n and @xmath1 , we can place an _ extraction _",
    "2-sphere * e * , of radius @xmath2 , where the gravitational field information is read out .",
    "this information is then evolved ( by means of the linearized einstein equations ) in @xmath3 , which ranges from * e * out to a large distance ( shown as a dotted circle ) where the asymptotic waveforms can be identified .",
    "outer boundary data for n can be constructed from perturbative data in the intersection of n and @xmath1 .",
    "previous investigations @xcite achieved the desired perturbative simplification by matching the nonlinear solution onto analytic solutions of einstein s equations linearized on a minkowski background .",
    "further simplification was achieved by decomposing perturbative data in a multipole expansion .",
    "we extend this approach to cases where curvature is significant by choosing as our approximation a linearization of einstein s equations on a schwarzschild background",
    ". in principal one could generalize further to a kerr background , and this will be the subject of future work .",
    "we also decompose perturbative data on this background with a multipole expansion , reducing the 3d linearized equations to a set of 1d equations for each multipole mode .",
    "this reduction allows us to evolve data everywhere in @xmath1 on a one - dimensional grid , l. it is important to note that all of the 3-dimensional tensor data in @xmath1 can be reconstructed from the multipole amplitudes on l. our method , therefore , is to match a computationally expensive evolution of the full einstein equations onto a considerably less expensive evolution on a 1d grid in a region where background curvature is still significant .",
    "1.0truecm      rather than characterize radiation asymptotically in terms of certain variables constructed from the metric @xcite , we use a new approach which characterizes radiation in terms of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "this is made possible by a recently developed spatially gauge - covariant hyperbolic formulation of general relativity .",
    "this system is constructed from first derivatives of the spacetime ricci tensor @xcite and may therefore appropriately be called the `` einstein  ricci '' system .    the einstein ",
    "ricci equations are obtained from the `` @xmath0 '' form of the metric , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lapse function , @xmath6 is the shift vector , and @xmath7 is the spatial metric in the slice @xmath8 .",
    "an appropriate time derivative operator that evolves spatial quantities along the normal to the slice @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lie derivative along the shift vector in @xmath8 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature @xmath11 of @xmath8 can be defined by @xmath12 which serves also as the evolution equation for the spatial metric . by working out the expression @xmath13 in @xmath0 form , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are components of the spacetime ricci tensor and @xmath16",
    "denotes the spatial covariant derivative , we find a wave - like equation which governs the evolution of @xmath11 :    @xmath17    where the physical wave operator for arbitrary shift is @xmath18 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : boxk ] ) is an identity until we substitute the einstein equations @xmath19 into @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the detailed form of the right hand side of ( [ eq : boxk ] ) can be found in @xcite ; the present conventions are those in @xcite . here",
    "we simply point out that @xmath20 has become a matter source that is zero here , @xmath22 is the nonlinear self - interaction term in @xmath0 form , and @xmath23 is a slicing - dependent term that must involve fewer than second derivatives of @xmath11 to render ( [ eq : boxk ] ) a true ( hyperbolic ) wave equation . a simple way to satisfy",
    "the restriction on @xmath23 is to invoke the harmonic slicing condition @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the trace of @xmath11 , and from which follows @xmath26 .    for appropriate choice of initial data @xcite , equations ( [ eq : defk ] ) , ( [ eq : boxk ] ) , and ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) represent the dynamical part of einstein s equations . combining them",
    "we obtain a quasi - diagonal hyperbolic equation for @xmath7 , with principal ( highest - order ) part @xmath27 .",
    "hence ( [ eq : defk ] ) , ( [ eq : boxk ] ) , and ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) may be said to give the `` third - order '' form of the einstein  ricci system .",
    "we note that the third - order einstein ",
    "ricci system can also be cast into a first - order symmetric hyperbolic form @xcite .   was inadvertently omitted .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "it also possesses a higher order form ( the `` fourth - order einstein  ricci system '' ) , essentially a wave equation for @xmath28 , obtained from @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this system has a well - posed cauchy problem and complete freedom in choosing both @xmath6 and @xmath5 : it has no analog of a slicing term like @xmath23 .",
    "this fourth - order form is used to develop fully gauge - invariant perturbation theory in @xcite .",
    "the first step in obtaining radial wave equations is to linearize the hyperbolic einstein - ricci equations around a static schwarzschild background .",
    "we separate the gravitational quantities of interest into background ( denoted by a tilde ) and perturbed parts : the 3-metric @xmath30 , the extrinsic curvature @xmath31 , the lapse @xmath32 , and the shift vector @xmath33 . in schwarzschild",
    "coordinates @xmath34 , the background quantities are given by    [ eq : background ] @xmath35    while the perturbed quantities have arbitrary angular dependence .",
    "the background quantities satisfy the dynamical equations @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and thus remain constant for all time . the perturbed quantities , on the other hand , obey the following evolution equations    [ eq : evolution ] @xmath38    where @xmath39 and the tilde denotes a spatial quantity defined in terms of the background metric , @xmath40 .",
    "note that the wave equation for @xmath41 involves only the background lapse and curvature .",
    "we can further simplify the evolution equation ( [ eq : kappawave ] ) by separating out the angular dependence , thus reducing it to a set of 1d equations .",
    "we accomplish this by expanding the extrinsic curvature in regge ",
    "wheeler tensor spherical harmonics @xcite and substituting this expansion into ( [ eq : kappawave ] ) . using the notation of moncrief @xcite",
    "we express the expansion as @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the regge ",
    "wheeler harmonics , which are functions of @xmath44 and have suppressed angular indices @xmath45 for each mode .",
    "the odd - parity multipoles ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and the even - parity multipoles ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ) also have suppressed indices for each angular mode and there is an implicit sum over all modes in ( [ eq : kappa_expand ] ) .",
    "the six multipole amplitudes correspond to the six components of @xmath41 .",
    "however , using the linearized momentum constraints    @xmath52    we reduce the number of independent components of @xmath41 to three .",
    "an important relation is also obtained through the wave equation for @xmath53 , whose multipole expansion is simply given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the standard scalar spherical harmonic and again there is an implicit sum over suppressed indices @xmath45 . using this expansion , in conjunction with the momentum constraints ( [ eq : momcon ] ) , we derive a set of radial constraint equations which relate the dependent amplitudes @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 to the three independent amplitudes @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 :    [ eq : constraints ] @xmath63\\ ;           ( a_\\times)_{_{\\ell m } } \\ , \\\\ % ( b_+)_{_{\\ell m } } & = & \\frac{1}{\\ell(\\ell+1 ) } [ ( 3+r\\partial_r)\\ ;           ( a_+)_{_{\\ell m } } - ( 1+r\\partial_r)\\ ;           ( h)_{_{\\ell m } } ] \\ ,         \\\\ % ( c_+)_{_{\\ell m } } & = & \\frac{1}{2(\\ell+2)(\\ell-1 ) }           \\{2(1-\\ell-\\ell^2)\\ ; ( a_+)_{_{\\ell m } } -           2\\ ; ( h)_{_{\\ell m } } +          \\ell(\\ell+1 ) [ ( 1 + 5\\widetilde n^2 ) +           2\\widetilde n^2 r\\ ; \\partial_r]\\ ; ( b_+)_{_{\\ell m}}\\ } \\ , \\\\ % ( d_+)_{_{\\ell m } } & = & \\frac{1}{\\ell(\\ell+1)}[(a_+)_{_{\\ell m } }           + 2 ( c_+)_{_{\\ell m } } - ( h)_{_{\\ell m } } ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for each @xmath45 mode .",

    "consider a 3d numerical relativity code which solves the cauchy problem of einstein s equations in either the standard adm form @xcite or in the hyperbolic form @xcite . during each timestep",
    "the procedure followed by our module for extracting radiation and imposing outer boundary conditions can be summarized in three successive steps : _ ( 1 ) _ _ extraction _ of the independent multipole amplitudes on * e * , _ ( 2 ) _ _ evolution _ of the radial wave equations ( [ oddwave])([evenwave2 ] ) on l out to the distant wave zone , _ ( 3 ) _ _ reconstruction _ of @xmath71 and @xmath72 at specified gridpoints at the outer boundary of n. we now discuss in detail each of these steps :    _ ( 1 ) _   _ extraction _    as mentioned in sect .",

    "@xmath11 and @xmath73 are computed on n as a solution to einstein s equations . in the test cases presented here , n uses topologically cartesian coordinates , although there are no restrictions on the choice of the coordinate system .",
    "the cartesian components of these tensors are then transformed into their equivalents in a spherical coordinate basis and their traces are computed using the inverse background metric , i.e. @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "from the spherical components of @xmath11 and @xmath73 , the independent multipole amplitudes for each @xmath45 mode are then derived by an integration over the 2-sphere :    [ integrals ] @xmath76 \\ ;       { y^*_{_{\\ell m } } } \\ ; d\\omega \\ , \\\\",

    "these are uniformly spaced two - dimensional ( 2d ) grids onto which the values of @xmath11 and @xmath73 are interpolated using either a three - linear or a three - cubic polynomial interpolation scheme .",
    "each point on the 2-sphere , denoted by spherical coordinate values @xmath44 , corresponds to a point @xmath77 on a stereographic grid whose coordinates can be combined into a single complex number @xmath78 :    @xmath79    where @xmath5 and @xmath80 denote the northern ( @xmath81 ) and southern ( @xmath82 ) hemispheres , respectively . as a result of this transformation ,",
    "the integrals over the 2-sphere in ( [ integrals ] ) are computed over the stereographic patches , which naturally avoid polar singularities ( see @xcite for a complete discussion of the properties and advantages of the stereographic coordinates ) . in our tests , the integrals over each patch",

    ", our module then evolves the radial wave equations ( [ oddwave])([evenwave2 ] ) for each @xmath84 mode forward to the next timeslice at @xmath85 .",
    "the outer boundary of the 1d grid is always placed at a distance large enough that background field and near - zone effects are unimportant , and a radial sommerfeld condition for the wave equations ( [ oddwave])([evenwave2 ] ) can be imposed there .",
    "of course , the initial data on l must be consistent with the initial data on n. this can either be imposed analytically or determined by applying the aforementioned extraction procedure to the initial data set at each gridpoint of l in the region of overlap with n. in the latter case , initial data outside the overlap region can be set by considering the asymptotic fall - off of each variable .",
    "it should be noted that in the cauchy - characteristic matching approach initial data also must be set in the characteristic hypersurfaces and , for realistic sources like binary black holes , will necessarily be approximate .    _ ( 3 ) _   _ reconstruction and matching _    from the perturbative data evolved to time @xmath86 , outer boundary values for n can now be computed .",
    "the procedure for doing this differs depending on whether a hyperbolic or an adm formulation of einstein s equations is used by the 3d `` interior code '' . for a hyperbolic code ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it is necessary to provide boundary data for @xmath71 and @xmath73 .",

    "@xcite ) , on the other hand , outer boundary data only for @xmath11 are necessary , since the interior code can calculate @xmath87 at the outer boundary by integrating in time the boundary values for @xmath11 . in either case , if outer boundary values for the lapse @xmath5 are needed [ e.g. for integrating harmonic slicing condition ( [ eq : harmonic ] ) ] , these can be computed by the perturbative module or by integration of @xmath25 at the boundary .    in order to compute @xmath11 at an outer boundary point of n ( or any other point in the overlap between n and @xmath1 @xcite ) ,",
    "it is necessary to reconstruct @xmath11 from the multipole amplitudes and tensor spherical harmonics .",
    "the schwarzschild coordinate values @xmath88 of the relevant gridpoint are first determined .",
    "next , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath89 for each @xmath45 mode are interpolated to the radial coordinate value of that point .",

    "wheeler tensor spherical harmonics @xmath90@xmath91 are computed for the angular coordinates @xmath44 for each @xmath45 mode and the sum in equation ( [ eq : kappa_expand ] ) is performed .",
    "this leads to the reconstructed component of @xmath41 ( and therefore @xmath11 ) ; a completely analogous algorithm is used to reconstruct @xmath73 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this procedure allows one to compute @xmath11 at any point of n which is covered by the perturbative region . as a result",
    ", the numerical module can reconstruct the values of @xmath71 and @xmath73 on a 2-surface of arbitrary shape , or any collection of points outside of * e*.    numerical implementation of this method is rather straightforward .",
    "very few modifications to a standard 3d numerical relativity code are necessary in order to allow for the simultaneous evolution of the highly dynamical region and of the perturbative one . because of the use of numerically inexpensive integration of 1d wave equations , implementation of this module provides gravitational wave extraction _ and _ stable outer boundary conditions with only minimal additional computational cost .",
    "finally , it should be noted that , in practice , we may not know _ a priori _ if the schwarzschild - perturbative approximation is valid near the outer boundary of a given numerical relativity simulation . through experimentation",
    ", however , it is possible to test the validity of the approximation .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by extracting data at different radii and comparing the waveforms computed at the outer sphere with those evolved from the inner sphere .",

    "these tests are designed to check that no coding error has been made and that the numerical scheme employed in the solution is providing results at the expected accuracy .",
    "while there are a number of different ways to perform these tests , we have exploited the knowledge of an analytic solution and computed the residuals @xmath111 between the computed solution @xmath112 and the analytic one @xmath113 as a function of the resolution ( or , equivalently , of the number of gridpoints ) . for a second - order accurate numerical scheme ( as the one used here ) on a uniform cubical grid , we expect the residuals to follow the simple law    @xmath114    where @xmath115 contains the second and higher order error terms and @xmath116 is the grid resolution , with @xmath117 being the spatial dimension of the grid .",

    "the time integration of ( [ oddwave])([evenwave2 ] ) on l is performed using a leapfrog integration scheme with a spatial resolution adjusted so that the timesteps in n and l are identical .",

    "for conciseness we consider here reconstructed outer boundary data only for @xmath11 ; the reconstruction of @xmath73 follows analogously .",
    "diagram ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : kzzpoint ] shows the timeseries of the reconstructed value of @xmath123 computed at the point @xmath124 for various resolutions and its comparison with the analytic solution .",
    "also in this case , diagram ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : kzzpoint ] gives proof of the second - order convergence of the numerical module even if , in this case , higher order error terms become apparent with the very coarse resolution simulations [ i.e. in the case of @xmath99 gridpoints ] .",
    "the small peak observed at @xmath125 is the result of a slight difference between the analytic initial data on l and the extracted signal at @xmath97 .",
    "this error rapidly disappears as the resolution is increased .",
    "1.0truecm    a more global measure of the accuracy and of the convergence properties of the boundary data is obtained by computing the @xmath126 norm of the error in @xmath11 as measured over the whole 3d outer boundary . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kzznorm ] we plot the @xmath126 norms of @xmath127 at successive resolutions , normalizing these differences by the factor which would make the plots overlap if the convergence to analytic data were exactly second - order . here",
    "we again see that the desired convergence rate is achieved over the whole boundary , particularly at finer grid resolutions .",
    "we have presented a method for matching gravitational data computed from a 3d cauchy evolution of einstein s equations to a computationally simpler evolution of radial wave equations linearized on a schwarzschild background .",
    "this method should be applicable to a variety of physical problems where curvature is significant throughout the computational domain , so long as the time - dependent fields can be treated as linear perturbations on a spherical background .",
    "our approach promises to offer an accurate means of computing asymptotically gauge - invariant waveforms at large distances from the domain of the simulation and to provide stable , physically correct boundary conditions .",
    "we have also discussed a numerical code we have developed that implements this procedure and can be used with a general numerical 3d simulation , solving einstein s equations in either the hyperbolic or adm formulation .",
    "this code correctly extracts waveforms from analytic linear wave data and recomputes that data at the outer boundary of the 3d grid .",
    "a more extensive discussion of the stability properties of this approach will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite , as well as practical issues arising from application to a real evolution code environment .",
    "our cauchy - perturbative matching method can be extended to more general circumstances , e.g. perturbations on axially symmetric backgrounds or other slicings of schwarzschild black holes .",
    "similar analyses using other hyperbolic formulations@xcite may also provide important insight to the physical understanding of radiation extraction and lead to modules which work with simulations based on these formulations .",
