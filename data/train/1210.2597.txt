    "the ising model is one of the simplest model proposed by statistical mechanics to investigate ferromagnetic properties of metals .",
    "it is based on the following simplification of reality : we assume that a ferromagnetic material is composed of macroscopic magnet that live on a lattice and can assume only two orientation , up ( or @xmath8 ) and down ( or @xmath6 ) called spins ; the way orientation of the micromagnet are determined follows two rules : neighboring magnets like to have the same orientation , and all spins like to align with the external magnetic fields if there is one .",
    "the ising model is a probabilistic model ( i.e.  a probability law on the set of possible spin orientation ) following these rules and is defined using a boltzman - gibbs formalism , which is detailed in the next section .",
    "it describes the equilibrium state of a ferromagnet .",
    "the stochastic ising model also called glauber dynamics or heat - bath dynamics for ising model , is a markov chain on the set of spin configuration that describes the evolution of a magnet out of equilibrium ( e.g.  after a brutal change of temperature or of external magnetic fields ) .",
    "this is the object we study in this paper .",
    "our aim is to understand the time needed and the pattern used for a magnetic material to reach its equilibrium state after a change of external conditions . in order to bring a more complete answer to these questions ,",
    "we consider them in a simplified but still non - trivial setup that is the zero - temperature limit .",
    "this brings heuristic intuition for what should happen in the whole low temperature regime .",
    "set @xmath9 consider the square @xmath10 ^ 2\\cap ( { { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb z } } } ^*)^2.\\ ] ] we define the set of spin configuration on @xmath11 to be @xmath12 .",
    "a generic spin configuration is denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is called the spin at site @xmath15 . define the external boundary of @xmath16 as @xmath17    the ising model at inverse temperature @xmath18 , with external magnetic fields @xmath19 and boundary condition @xmath20 is a measure on the set of spin configurations defined by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and the convention is taken that @xmath23 when @xmath24 .",
    "note that the first term in the exponential makes the spins of neighboring sites more likely to agree whereas the second term underlines that configuration with spins aligned with the magnetic fields are favored .",
    "the heat - bath dynamic for the ising model ( at inverse temperature @xmath18 , with external magnetic fields @xmath19 and boundary condition @xmath25 ) is a markov chain on the set of spin configuration @xmath26 .",

    "one starts from a given configuration @xmath28 and the rules for the evolution are the following :    * sites @xmath29 are equipped with independent rate one poisson process : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , i.e.  the increments @xmath32 are iid exponential variables .",

    "the main questions in the study of dynamics is how much time is needed to reach equilibrium and what is the pattern used by the chain to reach it when we consider the dynamics on a very large domain @xmath16 .",
    "the answer to this question should of course depend on the temperature @xmath18 , the magnetic fields @xmath19 , the boundary condition @xmath25 the and the initial condition @xmath28 .",
    "in what follows , we denote often by @xmath8 resp .  @xmath6 the spin configuration or boundary condition where all spins are @xmath8 resp .",
    "@xmath6 .",
    "let us review shortly what is known and conjectured for these kind of dynamics when @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the property of the dynamics depends crucially on the equilibrium property of the system .",
    "recall that the two dimensional ising model undertakes a phase transition at @xmath50 ( see the seminal work of onsager @xcite ) which has the following form :    * when @xmath51 , correlation between spin at different sites decay exponentially , and for this reason what happens in the center of @xmath11 becomes independent of the boundary condition when @xmath7 tends to infinity .",
    "this is called the high temperature phase . * when @xmath52 , on the contrary , long - range correlation are present between spins , and boundary condition plays a crucial role . in particular the measure @xmath53 and @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath6 boundary condition are very different .",
    "this is called the low temperature phase .    in the high temperature phase ,",
    "the rapid decay of correlation between distant sites makes the evolution of the system in two distant zones of the box @xmath11 almost independent .",
    "schematically , the box of @xmath11 can be separated in @xmath55 zones of finite size that come to equilibrium independently .",
    "this requires a time of order @xmath56 .",
    "this prediction has been made rigorous by lubetzky and sly , who proved that in that case , the mixing time ( i.e.  the time to reach equilibrium ) for the dynamic in @xmath11 is equal to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the relaxation time for the infinite volume dynamics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for a formal definition of mixing time and relaxation time and an introduction to the modern theory of markov chain , we refer to @xcite .    in the low temperature phase the behavior of the dynamics depends on the boundary condition and for the sake of simplicity we restrict to the case of @xmath8 boundary condition .",
    "in that case , the equilibrium state is biased towards plus , and even spins in the center have a larger probability to be @xmath8 than minus . in a sense , one can say that , at equilibrium , the center of the box `` knows '' what the boundary condition is . thus , if one starts e.g.  from full @xmath6 initial condition ( @xmath59 for all @xmath29 ) , information must travel from the boundary to the center of the box in order to reach equilibrium .",
    "for this reason the mixing time is much longer than in the high temperature phase .    in @xcite",
    ", lifshitz described a conjectural pattern used by the system with @xmath8 boundary condition to reach equilibrium that can be described as follows : starting from @xmath6 initial condition the system should rapidly reach a state of local equilibrium that looks like the equilibrium measure with @xmath6 boundary condition , ( we call this the @xmath6 phase ) ; then on the time - scale @xmath60 , something looking like the true equilibrium measure with @xmath8 boundary condition , the @xmath8 phase , should start to appear in the neighborhood of the cubes boundary . the interface between the @xmath8 and the @xmath6 phase should move on the diffusive time - scale @xmath60 , having a drift in time proportional to its local curvature . as a consequence the system should reach equilibrium when the bubble formed by the @xmath6 phase disappears macroscopically , _",
    "i.e. _ in a time @xmath55 .    for finite @xmath52",
    "this conjecture is far from being on rigorous mathematical ground , but lifshitz ideas have been used to get bounds on the mixing time .",
    "the best to date being by lubetzky _",
    "@xcite saying that the system reaches equilibrium in a time @xmath61 , still far from the conjecture @xmath60 .",
    "this gap between the lifshitz conjecture and the rigorous mathematical result has been one of the incentives to study the simpler zero - temperature version of the model .",
    "dynamics with different boundary condition or non - zero magnetic fields at low temperature also exhibits interesting behavior like low - temperature induced metastability ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that we choose not to expose here .",
    "note also that results are available at the critical temperature @xmath62 @xcite , where the equilibrium state of the system is somehow harder to describe .",
    "given @xmath63 , we look at the limiting dynamics when @xmath18 tends to infinity .",
    "we call this the zero - temperature limit ( recall that @xmath18 is the inverse of the temperature ) . in what follows",
    "we will consider only @xmath8 boundary condition : @xmath64 .    with this setup , on a finite box with @xmath8 boundary condition ,",
    "the limit of the ising measure @xmath65 is just the dirac measure on the full @xmath8 configuration : @xmath66 .",
    "the limiting dynamics is non - trivial and can be described as follows : the value the spin at @xmath15 is updated with rate one as before ; when a spin is updated it takes the value of the majority of its neighbors if it is well defined and take value @xmath67 with probability @xmath68 if it has the same number of @xmath8 and @xmath6 neighbors .",
    "the process can also be defined when @xmath69 , it corresponds to the case where both @xmath18 and @xmath19 tend to infinity with @xmath70 .",
    "the question concerning the pattern used to reach the equilibrium then takes the following form : starting from a finite domain of @xmath71 filled with @xmath6 spins what is the time needed to reach the whole @xmath8 configuration and what is the pattern used to reach it .",
    "more precisely : we consider a compact , simply connected subset @xmath72 ^ 2 $ ] whose boundary is a closed smooth curve . given @xmath73",
    "we consider the markov chain described above with initial condition @xmath74 in order to see a set of `` @xmath6 '' spins as a subset of @xmath75 , each vertex @xmath76 may be identified with the closed square of side - length one centered at @xmath15 , @xmath77 ^ 2.\\ ] ] one defines @xmath78 which is the `` @xmath6 droplet '' at time @xmath79 for the dynamics .",
    "note that the boundary of @xmath80 is a union of edges of @xmath81 ( and this is the reason why we defined the ising model on @xmath82 rather than on @xmath81 ) .",
    "we investigate the scaling limit of @xmath80 and the time needed for it to vanish .",
    "the nature of the scaling limit depends really much on the value of the external magnetic fields @xmath19 :    * if @xmath83 , the interface between @xmath8 and @xmath6 is always pushed towards the minus region , at linear speed , and thus macroscopic motion is visible on time - scale @xmath7 . *",
    "if @xmath49 , there is no sign that is favored , and the interface will be pushed in the direction of its curvature to reduce its length .",
    "this is visible only on the diffusive time scale .",
    "the main aims of this paper are : to review in detail the recent proof ( with co - authors @xcite ) that the scaling limit of @xmath80 is given by an anisotropic curve shortening flow , and to give a description of the scaling limit in the case @xmath83 ( for the sake of simplicity we will limit our proof to @xmath69 ) .",
    "let us focus first on the case of zero - magnetic fields , and make more precise the lifshitz conjecture @xcite concerning low temperature dynamics in this case .    on heuristic grounds ,",
    "lifshitz predicted that the boundary of @xmath80 should follow an anisotropic curve shortening motion : after rescaling space by @xmath7 and time by @xmath60 and letting @xmath7 tend to infinity , the motion of the interface between @xmath80 and its complement ( _ i.e. _ between @xmath8 and @xmath6 spins ) should be deterministic and the local drift of the interface should be proportional to the curvature .",
    "an anisotropic factor should appear in front of the curvature to reflect anisotropy of the lattice .",
    "spohn @xcite made this conjecture more precise and brought some elements for its proof : let @xmath84 denote the boundary of the ( random ) set @xmath85 .",
    "then , for @xmath86 , the flow of curve @xmath87 should converge to a deterministic flow @xmath88 and the motion of the limiting curve should be such that the normal velocity at a point @xmath89 is given by the curvature at @xmath15 multiplied an anisotropic factor @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the angle made by the outward directed normal to @xmath92 at @xmath15 together the horizontal axis ( see figure [ fig : suppfunc ] ) .",

    "starting from a general convex domain is not conceptually more complicated but would involve notational complication that we wish to avoid .",

    "the non - convex case is more delicate as the limiting shape has not a nice description and it might split into several connected components .",
    "all of this makes the analysis more complicated on a technical point of view but we believe that an analogous result could be proved in that case with some efforts if the initial condition is sufficiently nice , e.g.  with smooth boundary .",
    "remark [ magfied ] says that the scaling limit of set of @xmath6 spins is somehow independent of the intensity of the magnetic fields apart from an armless scaling factor .",
    "we want to discuss shortly here a way to obtain a non trivial intermediate regime ( sometimes referred to as a crossover regime ) between the cases @xmath83 and @xmath49 .",
    "we give a brief description of a conjecture concerning that case , based on heuristic consideration .",
    "the intermediate regime should take place when @xmath172 .",

    "the scaling should be @xmath175 and the limiting equation for the support function    @xmath176    the existence and uniqueness of solution to the above equation is a challenging issue .",
    "note that this type of scaling has already be studied in the context particle system in the case where the interface between @xmath8 and @xmath6 is the graph of a function ( see section [ prtsys ] ) and is often referred to as weakly asymmetric exclusion process or wasep .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite that in a certain sense , the height function of the particle system converges to the solution of @xmath177 which is as can be checked by the reader , is equivalent to in this case .",
    "these result could be used as a starting point to get the scaling limit starting from a compact convex shape filled with @xmath6 .",
    "again , the major difficulty seem to be on the analytical side , as on the probabilistic side , most of the tools applied in the proof of theorem [ th : convex ] could be applied .      of course , the ising model and the dynamics are also defined in higher dimensions @xmath178 , for which one as also a phase transition , and they have also raised a lot of interest ( in particular the case @xmath179 for obvious reason ) .",
    "let us briefly talk about what should be true in that case with a focus on low - temperature with plus boundary condition ( for high temperature , we can notice that the result of @xcite holds in every dimension ) .    the lifshitz conjecture for the low - temperature dynamics should hold in fact in any dimension .",
    "however rigorous results are even more difficult to obtain for the model with zero - magnetic fields : for finite @xmath18 the best known bound for the mixing time at low temperature with @xmath8 boundary condition is super - exponential ( it is equal to @xmath180 @xcite ) , which is really far from the conjectured @xmath55    concerning the zero - temperature case , results are much more precise : in @xcite , it has been proved that for @xmath179 , the time necessary for the last @xmath6 spin to disappear starting from a full cube with @xmath8 boundary condition is of order @xmath181 , a similar upper bound has been derived for arbitrary dimension @xmath182 in @xcite ( with no matching lower bound ) .",

    ". a first step would be to derive on a heuristic level the anisotropy function ( the equivalent of @xmath145 from ) , and it seems highly non - trivial .",
    "the anisotropy function should have a lot of singularity when @xmath178 .",
    "for instance , consider the three - dimensional dynamics on @xmath184 starting from initial condition @xmath185 where @xmath186 denote the two dimensional euclidean ball .",
    "if @xmath187 , then this initial configuration is stable , and the system stays forever in that state : every @xmath6 spin has a strict majority of agreeing neighbors and the same for @xmath8 spin .",
    "however , the mean curvature is well defined and positive at every point of the interface of the cylinder .    for the case of zero - temperature with positive @xmath19 , it should be rather simple to show that an hyper - cube full of minus of diameter @xmath7 needs a time of order @xmath7 to disappear .",
    "getting the exact asymptotic and a shape theorem seems more difficult but probably not out of reach .      in section [ tp ]",
    "we present some of the main tools of the proof .",

    "this construction gives a simple way to define simultaneously the dynamics for all initial conditions and boundary condition , using the same variable @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( we denote by @xmath203 the associated probability ) .",
    "moreover the coupling of dynamics thus obtained preserves the natural order on @xmath204 , given by @xmath205 ( this order is just the opposite of the inclusion order for the set of `` @xmath6 '' spins , which is therefore also preserved ) . indeed , if @xmath206 and @xmath207 resp .",
