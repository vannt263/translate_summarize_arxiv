    "the neutrino oscillations recently observed for the atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , solar neutrinos @xcite and reactor neutrinos @xcite have produced an explosion of both the experimental and theoretical studies of the neutrino .",

    ".    the phase difference can be recast into the following form @xcite _ ij = l , [ lipkinphase]where @xmath19 and denotes the distance from the neutrino source to the detector .",
    "it is often assumed that all mass eigen - components have _ equal energy _",
    "@xcite or _ equal momentum _",
    "@xcite , then for ultra - relativistic neutrinos with @xmath22 , this phase difference becomes the `` standard '' one that is used in most literatures @xcite _ ij .",
    "[ spd ]    the equal energy assumption ( eea ) or equal momentum assumption ( ema ) that is used to derive however has no direct experimental justification .",

    ", the eea and ema will have to be valid in our laboratory frame for all neutrino sources / experiments , which is very unlikely , even though still possible . due to this reason , these two assumptions are not specially favored over other possible assumptions",
    ". motivated by seeking a lorentz invariant description , in this paper we examine some consequences of the _ equal velocity assumption _",
    "( eva ) ; that is , all mass eigen - components of one flavor eigenstate propagate at equal velocity .",
    "the lorentz invariance of this assumption is shown in the appendix [ appd ] .    in section [ fmcsec ]",
    ", we first derive a relation between the four - momenta of a flavor eigenstate and its mass eigen - components using the four - momentum conservation . then using the eva , we derive in section [ dispsec ] the energy - momentum relation for the neutrino flavor eigenstate .",
    "it will be seen that the energy - momentum square difference ( emsd ) @xmath2 derived from the eva is a constant for any flavor neutrino @xmath23 with energy @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 , while those emsd derived from eea and ema varies with the energy and momentum respectively .",
    "because of this difference , these assumptions have an opportunity to be experimentally discriminated , even though the accuracy requirement might be challenging . in section [ pdsec ] ,",
    "the phase difference between two mass eigen - components is found to have a different dependance on the mass eigenvalues @xmath13 , compared to the usual phase difference .",
    "bounds on the masses @xmath13 and the mass difference are also calculated . in these derivations , we explicitly work in the case that there are three or two generation of flavor eigenstates , but the results are extendable to more than three generations . in section [ discsec ] , we discuss the pion decay and the possible kinematical and dynamical reasons for the eva .",
    "properties of neutrinos , especially their masses , are mostly measured in experiments using decays of particles involving neutrinos . among these , the tritium beta decay , the pion decay and the tau decay are the kinematically easiest . in tritium decay experiment ,",
    "one measures the energy spectrum of electrons near the end - point .",
    "the shape of end - point of this spectrum is affected by the mass of electron neutrino in a known way and therefore can be used to deduce the electron neutrino mass @xcite . in pion",
    "decay experiment , muon and muon neutrino are produced .",
    "measuring the momentum of muon in the rest frame of pion , the kinematics of such a two body decay allows one to solve the muon neutrino mass directly @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of tau decay through channel @xmath24 can similarly put an upper bound on the mass of tau neutrinos @xcite .",
    "for concreteness , let us consider the following example .",
    "suppose that a neutrino flavor eigenstate @xmath10 is detected in an event of the form _",
    "n |_n|_.[event]this can include the tritium , pion and tauon decay , and other neutrino events if we put every other particle except the neutrino to the left of the arrow .",
    "further let us suppose that the four - momentum @xmath25 of this neutrino flavor eigenstate @xmath10 is experimentally deducible from measurement of four - momenta of other particles and using the four - momentum conservation law in this event , i.e. , _",
    "n p^_n = p_^(e_,_)[fmconv]where @xmath26 is the four - momentum of @xmath27 .",
    "supposing the three mass eigen - components @xmath5 in the flavor eigenstate @xmath10 have four - momenta @xmath28 and velocities as @xmath29 for @xmath30 respectively , then these quantities should satisfy the on - shell condition e_i^2=p_i^2+m_i^2 , where @xmath31 and the relativistic four - momentum - velocity relation e_i=_i m_i,_i=_i m_i_i [ vmr ] where we take @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the lorentz factor of @xmath5 , @xmath34 is the speed of @xmath5 .",
    "we claim that these four - momenta satisfy the four - momentum conservation law of the following form p^_=_i |u_i|^2p^_i[epconv]or explicitly e_&=&_i |u_i|^2 e_i,[econv ] + _ & = & _ i |u_i|^2 _ i. [ pconv]this form of four - momentum conservation is based on the following argument .",
    "suppose we have a four - momentum operator @xmath35 that is applicable to the particles on the left hand side of event and on the mass eigen - component @xmath5 to yield their four - momenta respectively p^|_n&=&p^_n|_n,[pparticlea ] + p^|_i&=&p^_i |_i.[pparticleb]evaluating this operator on both sides of event and using the orthonormal relations _ n|_m&=&_mn  , [ ortha ] + _",

    "this form of the four - momentum conservation is based on the ability to assign a separate four - momentum to each mass eigen - components of the flavor neutrino , and on the existence of a four - momentum operator @xmath35 .",
    "they are fair assumptions that are used explicitly or implicitly in most literatures .",
    "therefore we believe that the conservation law derived from these assumptions is correct and we will use it in the following sections . in the appendix , we also show that this form of four - momentum conservation is compatible with lorentz boosts .",
    "now we make our main assumption of this paper : the velocities of three mass eigen - components are equal ; that is , they have the same magnitude and direction _",
    "1=_2=_3=.[equalv]this assumption has the advantage that it is lorentz invariant , i.e. , it holds in any reference frame . in the appendix ,",
    "this invariance is explicitly shown .",
    "moreover , in order for the interference phenomenon , such as neutrino oscillation , to happen , different components must remain coherent . because all mass eigen - components are generated at the same space point , the eva will guarantee that they stick together all the time and therefore remain coherent and the neutrino can oscillate .    in the following sections , we will show that this assumption has interesting and experimentally checkable consequences .",
    "but before we do that , it seems appropriate here to address an argument against the eva that was raised in refs . @xcite and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the argument is based on the following expressions .",
    "using relation , the assumption immediately implies that = = , = = .",
    "[ evaeq]then the argument was that while @xmath36 may be very small or large , in real experiment such as the @xmath37 decay , @xmath38 is always approximately 1 .",
    "however , it seems this argument is not valid here . in the neutrino detectors ,",
    "the energy of neutrino is always _ derived _ from the measurement of other particles in the same electroweak processes ( using equation in events like ) .",
    "thus what is measured in these experiments is always the energy of a neutrino flavor eigenstate , @xmath39 , but no the energy of its mass - eigencomponents , @xmath40 . and",
    "what is approximately one is the energy ratio @xmath41 of two neutrino flavor eigenstates in two events , but not the energy ratio of two components .",
    "therefore we believe the argument in ref .",
    "@xcite will not invalidate the eva .",
    "the first of the consequences that follows from the eva is a constant emsd @xmath2 for any flavor neutrino @xmath23 . using relation and the eva , the energy and the momentum become the following & & e_=_i |u_i|^2 m_i , [ energycon ] + & & p_=_i",
    "|u_i|^2 m_i v , [ momentumcon]where @xmath42 , @xmath43 . subtracting square of and , we get an energy - momentum relation e_^2-p_^2=_i |u_i|^2 m_i^2.[disp ]    because @xmath44 and @xmath13 are fixed physical constants , the equality implies that @xmath2 is lorentz invariant , i.e. , it has the same value in any reference frame .",
    "the lorentz invariance is also expected from the four - momentum conservation law : since the momenta @xmath45 of particles on the left hand side of are lorentz covariant , the momentum @xmath25 , which is just a sum of @xmath46 , is also lorentz covariant .",
    "however , equality further implies @xmath2 is single - valued .",
    "note that the lorentz invariance of @xmath2 dose not guarantee it is also single - valued : in two events with neutrino four - momenta @xmath47 and @xmath48 , each of @xmath49 and @xmath50 will be lorentz invariant but there is no a priori condition that forces them to be the same value , given that in our theory a neutrino flavor eigenstate is a superposition of three mass eigen - components .",
    "it is this single - valueness of the emsd that allows us to experimentally discriminate the eva from the eea and ema .",
    "consider the eea first . under this assumption ,",
    "all mass eigen - components have energy @xmath51 .",
    "the energy conservation then gives e = e_.the momentum of component @xmath5 then reads p_i=.using the momentum conservation we get p_=_i|u_i|^2 .",
    "therefore for the eea , we get the emsd e_^2-p_^2=e_^2-_i|u_i|^2 ^2 .",
    "[ star1]in the general case , the square of the sum in the right hand side of this equation dose not factor our @xmath52 and the entire right hand side will vary with the variation of @xmath3 . therefore in an experiment if two events with four - momenta @xmath47 and @xmath48 were measured to have different energy @xmath53 , the eea will yield @xmath54 , while the eva have @xmath55 . similarly for the ema , if each component has momentum @xmath56 , then from , p = p_,and therefore using e_=_i|u_i|^2,and finally we get e_^2-p_^2=_i|u_i|^2 ^2-p_^2 .",
    "[ star2]in the general case the right hand side has a non - trivial dependence on @xmath4 , which means @xmath2 will also be different for two events with different momentum @xmath4 .",
    "under current experimental conditions , only in the pion decay @xmath57 can one directly deduce @xmath58 from the measurement of muon energy and momentum .",
    "however the @xmath59 was found negative and therefore not physical @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this experiment will have to be improved and other experiments are needed in order to check the emsd , and and discriminate which assumption is correct . if the eva is correct and future experiments can measure the four - momentum @xmath60 for all three neutrino flavors @xmath10 , then the relation can be directly inverted to find out @xmath13 , assuming that @xmath61 s are independently measurable .",
    "these masses can be cross - checked with the masses obtained from neutrino oscillation experiments , which directly measure some function of masses @xmath13 .",
    "for the `` standard '' phase difference , this function is @xmath62 .",
    "here we show that using the eva , the phase difference defined in will take a slightly different form from . dividing by , we get v=.[vsol]now using , @xmath63 , @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath43 , the phase difference becomes _",
    "ij = l = m_ij _ k|u_k|^2m_k,[ph2]where @xmath66 and in the last step the emsd is used .",
    "it is convenient to define an effective mass @xmath67 for the flavor eigenstate @xmath10 m^_=_i |u_i|^2 m_i[effm].the phase difference then becomes _ ij = m^_m_ij[ph2rew ] .",
    "the result or is exact so far .",
    "it is valid to both the relativistic and non - relativistic neutrinos .",
    "if one further assume that the neutrino is ultra - relativistic , i.e. , @xmath68 , then the phase difference becomes _",
    "ij m_ij _ k|u_k|^2m_k .",
    "[ phrel]this form of the phase difference has the same dependence as the `` standard '' phase difference on the source - detector distance @xmath69 and the energy of neutrino @xmath3 .",
    "however they have an important difference in the remaining factor , i.e. , the part besides @xmath7 in the phase differences .",
    "the phase difference depends linearly on @xmath70 while the phase difference depends linearly on @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of flavors .",
    "this factor is one main parameter the neutrino oscillation experiments measure . from this factor , which henceforth will be denoted as @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) to simplify our later calculation , and using different phases and , bounds of different values on the neutrino masses can be extracted .",
    "this can be most clearly seen if we work in an situation that there are only two neutrino flavors and if we express @xmath13 and @xmath75 in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for the `` standard '' phase difference",
    ", we can solve the definitions ( m_i+m_j)(m_i - m_j)= , m_i - m_j = m_ij to obtain m_i&=&+m_ij , + m_j&= & -m_ij . without losing any generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath78 and therefore @xmath79 .",
    "then the positivity of @xmath75 and @xmath76 implies m_ij&&f , + m_i&&f.[clb]for the new phase difference , we have ( m_i+m_j)(|u_i|^2 m_i+|u_j|^2 m_j)= , m_i - m_j = m_ij , from which we solve m_i&= & + |u_j|^2m_ij , + m_j&= & -|u_i|^2m_ij .",
    "then the same positivity of @xmath75 and @xmath76 only implies m_ij & < & , + m_i&>&|u_j|f&|u_j|>|u_i| + & |u_j||u_i| . , where we implicitly used @xmath80 .",
    "when @xmath81 is small , the upper bound on @xmath76 can be very large .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath13 can be smaller or larger by a factor of @xmath82 than the corresponding bound predicted by the `` standard '' phase difference . because of the importance of these bounds in particle physics @xcite , muon decay parameters @xcite and cosmology @xcite , it becomes important to check which phase difference ( or ) is correct and whether neutrino mass - eigencomponents propagate at equal - velocity .",
    "we have seen that one important consequence of the eva is the single - valueness of @xmath2 , or equivalently @xmath83 .",
    "here we consider the single - valueness of @xmath2 in the pion decay @xmath57 and argue that it favors the eva .",
    "let us consider pion decay in the rest frame of the pion . using the four - momentum conservation in this case",
    ", we have e__&= & m_- + p__&=&p_where @xmath84 is the momentum of the muon and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the masses of the pion and the muon respectively .",
    "because experiment only measures one value of @xmath84 @xcite , @xmath58 and therefore also @xmath59 have only one value in this frame .",
    "as argued in section [ dispsec ] , this fact favors the eva over the eea and ema . if one takes a more aggressive point of view by insisting that the eea and ema should not only _ allow _ but also _ require _ the appearance of multiple values of @xmath59 if one repeats the experiment many times",
    " since there is no other kinematical reasons that stops the multiple values of the emsd from appearing for the eea and ema  then the pion decay experiment can even exclude the eea and ema .",
    "note that in this experiment the @xmath59 is just the effective mass square @xmath87 of the muon neutrino flavor eigenstate @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "if we extend the single - valueness of @xmath89 of @xmath90 in the pion decay and further require that @xmath67 of flavor eigenstate @xmath10 is indeed independent of the velocities of its mass eigen - components , e_^2-p_^2= _",
    "i|u_i|^2_im_i^2-_i|u_i|^2_im_iv_i^2=0,(j=1,2,3 ) .",
    "[ vind]then it is readily to find that in the general case that @xmath13 s are not degenerate or zero , the only solution to is @xmath91 . therefore the eva can be thought as a kinematical consequence of the independence requirement of @xmath2 on @xmath92 s .",
    "however to avoid any misleading , we need to point out that this velocity independence requirement is only a sufficient but not necessary condition for the single - valueness of the @xmath2 or @xmath83 .    if we accept the eva , then the most important question becomes : what is the dynamical reason for the equal velocity ?",
    "in this analysis , we implicitly assumed that there are three mass components which , besides that they are linearly superposed to form a flavor eigenstate , are dynamically independent .",
    "however in reality they might interact through weak processes and this interaction might provide all / part of the reason for the eva .",
    "note that one can try to ask the same question for quarks too : do quark mass eigen - components of a flavor eigenstate propagate at the same velocity ? there in the strong interactions ,",
    "if quarks are expressed in mass eigen - components then the ckm matrix has to be incorporated .",
    "however because there is no free quark propagating due to confinement , the question how dose a free quark flavor eigenstate travel in vacuum can be avoided .",
    "our treatment of neutrino in this work depends primarily on the ability to assign a four - momentum and velocity to each mass eigen - component .",
    "therefore our treatment is classical : we do not consider any quantum fluctuation of the particle @xcite .",
    "if a more rigorous wave packet treatment were used and we still want to impose the same eva , then we would have to assign the central values of the four - momentum of the wave packet @xmath5 as @xmath93 in and require it to satisfy the relation , which is equivalent to the eva in this case .",
    "indeed , the wave packet treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the eqs . ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.6 ) ) would have led to our phase difference if they are granted the four - momentum conservation law and the eva .",
    "finally let us point out that the eva in neutrino oscillation was first suggested in @xcite and then considered in @xcite .",
    "however none of the emsd , or or the phase difference or was derived . indeed , these references got a phase difference that is similar to the `` standard '' one .",
    "therefore the results in this paper are all new , in addition to that they are experimentally checkable .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "in this appendix we show that the eva and the four - momentum conservation are compatible with lorentz boosts .",
    "suppose the four - momentum of a flavor eigenstate is measured in one frame as @xmath94 ( for simplicity let us assume that all momenta are in a fixed direction ) . and",
    "suppose in the same reference frame the four - momenta and velocities of the mass eigen - components are @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "let us suppose the lorentz boost has a relative velocity @xmath97 in the same direction of the motion of the neutrino with respect to the initial frame and let us denote @xmath98 and @xmath99 . under this boost , the four - momenta @xmath95 change to @xmath100 in the following way e_i^ + p_i^=^1&-^ + -^ & 1e_i + p_i , i=1,2,3.explicitly ,",
    "they are e_i^&= & ^(e_i-^p_i ) + p_i^&= & ^(-^e_i+p_i ) .    if the energies of different mass eigen - components were equal : @xmath101 , then because @xmath102 and hence @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 ) , we will have e_i^= ^(e_i-^p_i)^(e_j-^p_j)=e_j^. similarly , if the momenta of different mass eigen - components were equal : @xmath105 , then because @xmath102 and hence @xmath104 , we will have p_i^= ^(-^e_i+p_i)^(-^e_j+p_j)=p_j ^.it is seen then the equal energy or momentum assumption is not compatible with lorentz boosts . while for the equal velocities : @xmath106 , under the same boost they transform to v_i^=. apparently , the same velocity assumption holds under this boost .",
    "now we show that the four - momentum conservation law also holds under the boost .",
    "because the four - momentum @xmath60 is deduced from event or formula , then under the lorentz boost the requirement of four - momentum conservation is equivalent to the lorentz invariance of @xmath107 .",
    "the later could be shown easily . using the four - momentum relation and , we have & & e^_=_i|u_i|^2 e_i^=_i|u_i|^2 ^(e_i-^p_i)=^(e_-^p _ ) + & & p^_=_i|u_i|^2 p_i^=_i|u_i|^2 ^(-^e_i+p_i)=^(-^e_+p _ ) .",
    "it is then readily to check the lorentz invariance of @xmath108 e_^2-p_^2&=&^2e_^2(1-^2)-(1-^2)p_^2 + & = & e_^2-p^2_.        y.  ashie _ et al . _",

    "<S> the neutrino masses and oscillation are closely related to how neutrino propagates . in this paper , we first derive a new form of four - momentum conservation that connects the four - momentum @xmath0 of the neutrino flavor eigenstate and the four momenta @xmath1 of its mass eigen - components </S>",
    "<S> . then we use the assumption that the mass eigen - components travel at equal velocity to derive the energy - momentum square difference ( emsd ) @xmath2 for the flavor eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for the equal velocity assumption , @xmath2 will be a fixed constant in events with different @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the equal energy or equal momentum assumption , @xmath2 will vary with @xmath3 or @xmath4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these emsd can be checked by ongoing and future neutrino experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the phase difference between two neutrino mass eigen - components @xmath5 and @xmath6 is then derived for the equal velocity assumption . for relativistic neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the phase difference depends linearly on the distance energy ratio @xmath7 , the mass difference @xmath8 and an effective mass , in contrary to the linear dependance on @xmath7 and @xmath9 as the phase difference for equal energy or equal momentum assumption dose . </S>",
    "<S> the new phase difference implies different bounds on the neutrino masses or mass difference . </S>"
