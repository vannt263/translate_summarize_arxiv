    "manganites ( re@xmath0ae@xmath1mno@xmath4 ; re = y , rare earth ; ae = pb , ca , sr , ba ) with perovskite structure have been extensively investigated since the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect.@xcite the spontaneous insulator to metal transition and its associated cmr effect are well explained on the basis of the double exchange ( de ) model between mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath7 ions.@xcite furthermore , the phase separation ( ps ) model , where the ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic and antiferromagnetic charge ordered ( afm - co ) insulating clusters of competing electronic phases coexist , strongly supports experimental studies of manganites.@xcite in a recent study@xcite on the bandwidth - temperature - magnetic field phase diagram of re@xmath8sr@xmath9mno@xmath4 with nearly half doping , the bandwidth was controlled by chemical substitution and hydrostatic pressure . in particular , near a critical pressure , the character of the ferromagnetic transition varies from the first to second order .",
    "the applied pressure gives rise to a larger bandwidth accompanied by a decrease of short range charge / orbital ordering fluctuations , resulting in weakened first order transition .",
    "several recent researches for metamagnetic transitions of doped manganites in the phase separated state have revealed that ultrasharp magnetic transition of pr@xmath10ca@xmath10mn@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath4 appears at low temperatures . to account for this phenomenon ,",
    "a martensitic model based on lattice mismatch between competing co and fm phases has been proposed@xcite but questions have been raised as to the validity of such a scenario.@xcite it is believed that the martensitic scenario is ruled out since grain boundaries in polycrystalline samples act as `` fire wall '' against such a progress of magnetic transition , resulting in a suppression of its steplike transition .",
    "ghivelder et al . , have observed a sudden temperature rise ( @xmath13 30 k ) associated with the steplike magnetic transition of la@xmath14pr@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath4 ( @xmath16 ) , indicating a release of large latent heat ( or entropy ) from low - temperature phase - separated to fm ordered states . according to their findings,@xcite after zero - field cooling , the manganite system showing the steplike transition reaches a thermally stable state with a small , and almost time independent fraction of fm , which is dispersed as isolated regions within a co matrix .",
    "this phase separated state is realized at low temperatures by large energy barriers separating the afm - co and fm phases and strains due to the lattice mismatch between the coexisting phases .",
    "increasing the temperature under the applied field , the system is then transfered from the equilibrium to non equilibrium states , promoting a growth of the fm phase over the majority afm - co matrix .    a close relationship of the @xmath17 phase diagram with steplike metamagnetic transition for low band width manganites ,",

    "the fm transition of local region generates a release of latent heat , which drives its neighbor regions of non fm states to fm ordering state because the temperature rise at low temperatures gives rise to a lower critical field promoting further fm ordering .",
    "furthermore , analysis of experimental data on the magnetization step in phase separated manganites la@xmath14pr@xmath1ca@xmath15mno@xmath4 ( @xmath22 , 0.38 , and 0.36 ) points to the role of thermal coupling as a key parameter of the instability in a dynamical system.@xcite    the eu@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath4 ( @xmath23 for polycrystalline samples ) system is a spin - glass like insulator at low temperature because the substitution of eu ion with smaller ion radius for la site gives rise to both narrow band width and an increase in the quenched disorder.@xcite it is well known that the former and latter parameters are controlled by the average value and the variance of the re / ae ionic radii in re@xmath0ae@xmath1mno@xmath4 , respectively.@xcite in a previous work on single crystalline eu@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath4 ( @xmath24 ) , the co phase is not formed in a long - range manner due to an increased quenched disorder .    in this paper , to examine the steplike metamagnetic transition and its associated lattice change in the phase separated manganite , we demonstrate the effect of pressure on both the isothermal magnetization and magnetostriction in ( eu@xmath0gd@xmath1)@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 ( @xmath5 and 0.1 ) . in  2 , the experimental outline is described . in  3 ,",

    "the pellets were finally sintered at @xmath29 @xmath28c for 36 h. x - ray diffraction data revealed that all samples are almost single phase with orthorhombic structures ( @xmath30 ) .",

    ", it is believed that after zero - field cooling procedure the manganite system showing steplike magnetic transition stays in a low - temperature phase separated state with a small , and almost time independent fraction of fm regions dispersed within a co matrix . in other words ,",
    "the low temperature ps state of the lpcmo system is taken as a blocked one preventing a growth of fm phase over the co one in a finite time scale .",
    "on the other hand , upon increasing temperature , the intermediate - temperature ps state above 20 k accompanies the time evolution of the fm phase , resulting in an increased magnetization ( unblocked ps state ) .",
    "we notice that a similarity in the temperature - magnetic field phase diagram including the @xmath46 curve between polycrystalline lpcmo and esmo .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of zfc magnetization under 1 t in fig.[mt ] is strongly suppressed at low temperatures below 20 k , which is responsible for the blocked ps state separated from the fm one by high energy barriers .",
    "effect of external pressure on the present system lowers the energy barriers separating coexisting phases and makes the blocked state unstable , resulting in a lower critical field needed for the occurrence of the steplike transition . in the zfc curve measured at 0.8 gpa , the low temperature ps state",
    "is limited at lower temperatures below 10 k in comparison to the magnetization data without pressure .",
    "however , it should be noted that the ps state of the present samples is composed of the fm clusters embedded within paramagnetic matrix since the temperature dependence of the magnetization exhibits such no clear co and/or afm transition above curie temperature as lpcmo . in lpcmo system , upon decreasing temperature the co phase is stable in a long range manner below @xmath68 k , then the fm phase starts to order near @xmath69 k and finally the ps state is formed below 20 k through the fm and co states . in the ps state of the lpcmo system ,",
    "the co matrix coexists with fm clusters , while for the eusrmno system the fm and co clusters are dispersed within the pm matrix.@xcite this type of ps state with the pm matrix is also common to the ( la@xmath3pr@xmath2)@xmath70sr@xmath71mn@xmath26o@xmath72 bilayered manganite , where a field - induced steplike transition appears at low temperatures.@xcite    next , we estimate a tolerance factor , @xmath73 , using the averaged ionic radius of a site cations ( @xmath74 = @xmath75 ) , which is related to the effective one - electron bandwidth of the manganite sample.@xcite in addition to it , we evaluate the variance of the ionic radii , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the fractional occupancies and the effective ion radii of cations of re@xmath6 and ae@xmath79 , respectively.@xcite for the parent sample , we obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82 . for the gd substituted sample , @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath82 .",
    "theses finding indicate that light gd substitution for eu gives rise to a slight decrease in @xmath73 and a stable increase in @xmath85 , indicating a reduction of bandwidth and an increase of the magnitude of disorder . in a previous work@xcite on electronic phase diagram against the external pressure for the single crystalline ( nd@xmath86sm@xmath87)@xmath10sr@xmath10mno@xmath4 ( @xmath88 ) , the conversion coefficient from the external pressure to the tolerance factor",
    "is calculated to @xmath89/gpa . using this pressure coefficient",
    ", the applied pressure of 0.8 and 1.2 gpa corresponds to an increase of @xmath73 = @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the difference in @xmath73 between the parent and gd@xmath92 samples is decreased due to the stronger applied pressure on the latter sample .",
    "it is true that the magnetization behavior of the gd@xmath92 sample under 1.2 gpa is quite similar to that of the parent one at 0.8 gpa except for the higher field region .",
    "we expect that the different profile at higher fields such as the multi steplike behavior ( fig.[mhg](a ) ) arises from the difference in the quenched disorder between the parent and gd doped samples .",
    "the application of external pressure on the magnetostriction of the sample studied lowers the critical field , but the steplike behavior in @xmath55 at 4.2 k is not changed under a high pressure of 0.8 gpa , as well as the effect of pressure on the magnetization , as shown in fig.[lh ] .",
    "both the magnetization and magnetostriction data point to the steplike volume shrinkage associated with the ferromagnetic magnetic transition , which does not agree with the previous measurement on polycrystalline sm@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath4.@xcite we suppose that a strain gauge attached with the sample will be not responsible for a rapid variation although the reason is not made clear .",
    "it is interesting to note that a steplike lattice transformation of single crystalline ( la@xmath3pr@xmath2)@xmath70sr@xmath71mn@xmath26o@xmath72 ( lpsmo ) bilayered manganite is established by the application of magnetic field .",
    "accordingly , it is reasonable that the steplike magnetic transition accompanies the ultrasharp lattice deformation at the same critical field .    finally , we give some comments on the effect of pressure on the magnetostriction in a bilayered manganite because it seems to be contrary to that found in present work.@xcite following the neutron diffraction study of the lpmso bilayered manganite crystal under hydrostatic pressure,@xcite the applied pressure lowers the critical field of the field - induced fm states but broads the pm to fm transition region .",
    "the external pressure strengthens the de interaction in the bilayers , while it weakens the super exchange interaction between the adjacent bilayers .",
    "this finding is close to a different response of crystal structure to the applied pressure between bilayered and cubic manganites .",
    "in addition , we note that in previous works on the effect of pressure on the transport , magnetization , and magnetostriction of eu@xmath18sr@xmath19mno@xmath4 compound by several authors , novel phenomena such as steplike magnetic transition and/or its associated magnetostriction are never referred.@xcite",
    "we have investigated the influence of external pressure on the steplike magnetic transition and its concomitant magnetostriction in the polycrystalline ( eu , gd)@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 .",
    "a suppression of the energy barrier separating between the fm and low - temperature phase separated states under pressure leads to lowering the critical field .",
    "the further application of external pressure up to 1.2 gpa on the parent sample substantially weakens the low temperature phase separated state , resulting in collapses of the ultrasharp metamagnetic transition and its concomitant lattice striction .",
    "x ray diffraction patterns of the parent sample taken under high fields at low temperatures show the stable decrease of average lattice parameters , which is consistent with the magnetostriction behavior .",
    "our data indicate the importance of the low - temperature phase segregated state in the doped manganite system exhibiting the steplike transition .",
