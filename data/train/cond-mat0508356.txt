    "the undoped parent compounds of the high-@xmath5  superconducting cuprates , like la@xmath6cuo@xmath4 , are antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulators . upon introducing a small amount of holes , e.g. , by substituting la with sr in la@xmath6cuo@xmath4 , the commensurate long - range order",

    "it is believed that a proper understanding of the magnetism is crucial for a theoretical description of high-@xmath5  cuprates .",
    "on the theoretical side , the suppression of af order upon hole doping is reasonably well understood .",
    "@xcite numerous approaches employ effective single - band models with strong correlations to describe the copper oxide planes .",
    "the magnetic order , present in the half - filled nel state , is scrambled by the motion of holes  this leads to heavy hole quasiparticles ( so - called magnetic or spin polarons ) and to a reduction of the magnetic order parameter , accompanied by a softening of the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "@xcite ( a different approach describing the destruction of af order , based on the idea that holes introduce strongly ferromagnetic frustrating bonds , has been proposed in refs .  .",
    ")    localized impurities provide an interesting tool to investigate bulk properties of strongly correlated systems in general , and high-@xmath5  cuprates in particular .",
    "doping of non - magnetic impurities ( i.e.  vacancies ) into the parent antiferromagnet,@xcite e.g. in la@xmath6cu@xmath10zn@xmath11o@xmath4,@xcite leads to a gradual suppression of magnetism , with long - range order surviving up to the percolation threshold , @xmath12 .",
    "one expects that combining hole doping and non - magnetic impurities would lead to a destruction of the af order even faster than with hole doping alone .",
    "surprisingly , magnetization measurements on la@xmath2sr@xmath3cu@xmath10zn@xmath11o@xmath4by hcker _",
    "@xcite have shown that this is not the case .",
    "they found that introducing non - magnetic zn impurities in lightly doped la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4  ( @xmath13 ) causes an initial _ increase _ of the nel temperature , @xmath14 , while only an addition of zn beyond @xmath15 leads to a decrease of @xmath14 .",
    "concomitantly , the decrease of @xmath14  with increasing hole doping @xmath9 is much weaker in zn - doped compounds .",
    "recently , it has been found that such an impurity - induced re - appearance of the af ordering is even more pronounced in samples with magnetic ni impurities .",
    "@xcite    the purpose of the present paper is a theoretical description of the combined effect of mobile holes and static vacancies in lightly doped mott insulators .",
    "we argue below that vacancies primarily prevent the holes from destroying the long - range ordered magnetism ; other ( purely magnetic ) effects are subdominant . starting from a magnetically ordered state",
    ", we consider the influence of mobile holes on the host magnetism in a situation where hole quasiparticles scatter off the static impurities .",
    "technically , we employ a @xmath0-@xmath1 model and the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) to account for the interaction between holes and spin waves ; @xcite the effect of the impurities is treated via a self - consistent @xmath16-matrix approach .",
    "we show that the destructive effect of holes on the background magnetism is reduced ( i ) when holes are less mobile or less dispersive and ( ii ) when holes are less coherent , both changes caused by the addition of non - magnetic impurities .",
    "this results in commensurate antiferromagnetism being more robust against hole doping for impurity - doped host systems compared to clean ones .",
    "we obtain detailed magnetization curves as function of hole and impurity doping , being in good agreement with the available data on la@xmath2sr@xmath3cu@xmath10zn@xmath11o@xmath4 .",
    "( incommensurate magnetism , as occurs for hole doping @xmath17 , with much smaller ordering temperature , is not the subject of this paper . )    before describing our theoretical approach , we briefly summarize impurity effects in insulating quantum magnets and in cuprate materials .      in a quantum spin system (",
    "i.e.  a mott insulator ) , which can be tuned between an antiferromagnetic and a paramagnetic ground state , the effect of static non - magnetic impurities ( i.e.  vacancies ) is markedly different in both phases , the origin being the random berry phases introduced by the doping . as mentioned above",
    ", introducing vacancies into the long - range ordered magnet weakens the magnetic order . at small impurity concentrations ,",
    "this effect can be well captured using linear spin - wave theory.@xcite for a square lattice geometry , long - range magnetism persists up to the percolation threshold@xcite @xmath18  this has been nicely verified for la@xmath6cu@xmath10zn@xmath11o@xmath4  using neutron scattering.@xcite the quantum phase transition at @xmath19 displays an interesting interplay of classical percolation physics and quantum effects.@xcite    in contrast , removing spins in the quantum paramagnet ( which is a valence bond crystal ) has been shown to create effective magnetic moments in the vicinity of the dopants.@xcite microscopically , the formation of the moments can be understood as breaking of host valence bonds .",
    "the impurity - induced moments are magnetically coupled via the ( gapped ) host spin excitations and  in the absence of geometric frustration",
    " eventually order at very low temperatures.@xcite thus , at zero temperature the paramagnetic phase of the clean host is replaced by a phase with weak magnetic order through doping with non - magnetic impurities .    besides vacancies , also magnetic impurities may be introduced into quantum magnets , either by replacing host ions by ions of different spin ( e.g.  cu by ni ) , or inserting additional ( e.g.  out - of - plane ) magnetic ions . at small doping , the physics is similar to the one in the case of vacancies , i.e. , it is dominated by the low - energy behavior of the impurity moments ( random berry phases ) , but percolation physics at larger doping is absent .",
    "impurity effects in cuprate superconductors are diverse , most prominent being the rapid suppression of superconductivity by in - plane impurities like zn or ni substituting for cu . for hole concentrations in the superconducting regime",
    ", it has also been shown that nominally non - magnetic impurities like zn or li induce magnetic moments , which have a staggered spatial structure around the actual impurity site .",
    "nmr @xcite shows that the impurity moments form at temperatures above 400 k , and the formation mechanism is believed to be similar to that in an insulating paramagnet , i.e. , breaking of singlet bonds described above .",
    "however , impurity - induced magnetic order has not been detected , the reason likely being strong quantum effects ( e.g.  kondo screening of the moments ) due to the presence of mobile charge carriers .",
    "( one exception is magnetic order in co - doped yba@xmath6cu@xmath20o@xmath21@xcite  due to the large spin of co quantum effects are weaker . )",
    "further effects of zn and similar impurities in cuprates with larger hole doping include magnetic in - gap states,@xcite the broadening of the gapped bulk spin excitations , possible pinning of charge - density modulations ( stripes ) , the local modulation of the superconducting order parameter , and large peaks in the density of states close to the fermi level ( as seen e.g. in stm ) .    for smaller hole doping ( i.e.  in the insulating regime ) ,",
    "the impurity effects on magnetism and transport have also been studied extensively.@xcite in la@xmath2sr@xmath3cu@xmath10zn@xmath11o@xmath4  with @xmath22 , co - doping with zn leads to a re - appearance of ordered magnetism .",
    "the relatively high ordering temperatures suggest that this is _ not _ just the magnetism of impurity moments as described above for insulating magnets ( which would be weak , as in mg - doped tlcucl@xmath20 @xcite ) .",
    "the continuous evolution of the ordering temperature with @xmath9 and @xmath23 also hints that the magnetism in the zn and hole - doped material is smoothly connected to the commensurate antiferromagnetism of the parent compound , i.e. , it is neither stripe - like nor strongly glassy .",
    "( note that the freezing temperature in the spin - glass state of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4is much below the ordering temperature observed in refs .  .",
    "the suppression of glassy behavior upon zn doping is also consistent with very recent @xmath24sr and susceptibility data.@xcite ) a natural conclusion is that the zn impurities primarily `` undo '' the effect caused by the mobile holes on the commensurate antiferromagnetism .",
    "resistivity measurements in la@xmath2sr@xmath3cu@xmath10zn@xmath11o@xmath4  indicate a decreasing hole mobility with increasing zn doping . taken together , we conclude that zn impurities tend to hinder the coherent motion of holes and thus prevent the magnetic order from being scrambled  this will be the central idea of our approach below .",
    "other effects , namely the generation of effective staggered moments around zn and vacancy dilution of the magnetism ( leading to percolation physics for @xmath23 close to @xmath25 ) , are clearly present , but are assumed to be subleading ( at least for small impurity concentration ) .",
    "we note that an interesting dopant in la@xmath6cuo@xmath4  is li ( substituting for cu )  this provides both an extra hole and a vacancy in the cuo plane .",
    "studies@xcite of la@xmath6cu@xmath26li@xmath27o@xmath4  have shown that commensurate magnetism survives up to @xmath28 .",
    "transport data indicate that the holes introduced by li doping remain localized also for larger @xmath29 ( in contrast to sr doping ) .",
    "recent experimental studies show that charge and spin dynamics in la@xmath6cu@xmath26li@xmath27o@xmath4  appear to be glassy over a large range of doping.@xcite thus , the behavior of la@xmath6cu@xmath26li@xmath27o@xmath4  is different from the one of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cu@xmath10zn@xmath11o@xmath4  with @xmath30 , the reason clearly being on the quantum chemistry side ( e.g.  the pinning potentials for holes being different for li and zn sites ) .",
    "proposed an antiferromagnetic cluster state arising from coulomb trapping of holes to explain some of the properties of la@xmath6cu@xmath26li@xmath27o@xmath4 , but more theoretical studies are clearly required .",
