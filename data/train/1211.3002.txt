    "quantum information processing , based on principles of quantum mechanics , promises algorithms surpassing their classical counterparts and unconditional secure for quantum communication . combined with relativity which is another cornerstone of modern physics ,",
    "a new fast - growing field called relativistic quantum information ( rqi ) has attracted much attentions in recent years ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review ) . besides its importance in probing extremely sensitive gravitational effects @xcite , it can also shed lights on study of black hole information paradox @xcite and cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of rqi process in laboratory systems like atomic interferometry @xcite and circuit qed @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "a novel phenomenon in rqi is that quantum correlations of a mostly entangled physical system are highly observer - dependent . for a bipartite entangled system in flat space",
    ", it was shown @xcite that an accelerated observer , having no access to information beyond his acceleration horizon , would experience some decrement of the quantum correlations he shared initially with an inertial partner .",
    "therefore the information - loss results in the celebrated unruh effect @xcite which claims the detection of a thermal bath for an accelerated detector in flat space .",
    "such decoherence phenomena should exist for any other kinds of causal horizons related with thermal radiation , e.g. , the event horizon of black hole @xcite . by a process akin to teleportation but without the classical information transmitted @xcite , quantum information can even escape from a black hole .",
    "while above studies focus on entangled global modes , recently , entanglement between fields or systems localized in spacetime has also attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "these entangled localized systems can in principle be measured and exploited for real quantum information tasks @xcite .    as an idealization of inflation regime in cosmology ,",
    "de sitter space possesses a cosmological event horizon , from which a thermal spectrum with temperature @xmath3 could be detected by a static observer @xcite .",
    "this so - called gibbons - hawking effect results from the highly non - trivial definition of a vacuum state in a time - dependent background where no global timelike killing vectors could be found .",
    "the unique bunch - davies vacuum for a comoving observer , matching with minkowskian vacuum at _ arbitrary _ short distance , appears as thermal state for a static partner who defines a distinct static vacuum and has no access to the field modes beyond the cosmological horizon @xcite .",
    "this information loss with gibbons - hawking radiation should certainly cause a decoherence phenomenon for an inertial observer in de sitter space . since the thermal spectrum described by a same formula as for the temperature of hawking radiation and unruh effect , it is wildly believed @xcite that , for rqi in de sitter space ,",
    "nothing would change in essentially but only the hubble parameter @xmath4 replacing the surface gravity of black hole or the acceleration of unruh detector . however , as we show in this paper , it s _ not _ the whole story .",
    "the main point is that the definition of bunch - davies vacuum , which relies on an ability to follow a field mode to infinitesimal scales , should be broken near some fundamental scale of quantum gravity .",
    "effectively , this means a boundary condition on the vacuum of comoving observer must be imposed when the momentum of field mode @xmath5 cutoff at planck scale @xmath6 .",
    "such constraint can also be interpreted as choosing a harmonic oscillator vacuum at the earliest time @xmath7 , which eventually results a robust anisotropy signal in cmbr @xcite .",
    "therefore , in de sitter space , any quantum information processing with a particular choice of initial vacuum should include those modifications from planck scale , since it has a directly consequence on the behaviors of quantum correlations @xcite . even without a complete knowledge about quantum gravity , such investigation on rqi processing",
    "may provide a new typical signature to probe planckian physics @xcite .",
    "extensive studies show @xcite that above boundary conditions can be resolved by selecting a non - trivial invariant de sitter vacuum state called @xmath0-vacuum , predicted in a free quantum field theory in de sitter space and can be distinguished by a real number @xmath0 if the theory consistent with cpt invariance @xcite . among this infinite family , a unique element labeled by @xmath8",
    "could be identified with the bunch - davies state , over which other vacua @xmath9 can formaly be realized as squeezed state @xcite , yet each of the vacua @xmath9 with different uv behavior is the ground state of a different hilbert space . in the spirit of ds / cft correspondence @xcite",
    ", these vacua with @xmath10 could be related to marginal deformation of boundary cft .",
    "both bosonic and fermionic @xmath0-states have been found and play a significant role in cosmology .",
    "for instance , fermions in nonthermal state could couple to inflaton field and has significantly larger loop corrections than that would be expected from the bunch - davies choice , even when the inflaton itself is in bunch - davies vacuum @xcite .",
    "very recently , a first direct signature of the primordial gravitational wave has been announced by bicep2 @xcite . to reconcile the bicep2 result and the planck upper limit",
    ", many attempts have been made @xcite by introducing departure from the usual bunch - davies case to get enhanced spectra .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the quantum correlations between free quantum field modes ( both bosonic and fermionic ) and related quantum communication channels in de sitter space , while the planckian modification presented by choice of a particular @xmath0-vacuum . for a static observer ,",
    "these @xmath0-vacua become excited and exhibit non - thermal feature derived by the bogoliubov transformation on his static vacuum .",
    "therefore , in a mostly entangled bipartite system , a deviation from gibbons - hawking decoherence should be detected by the inertial observer who is immersed in a bath of non - thermal radiation emanating from the cosmological horizon , while his partner comoving with respect to conformal time see the same entanglement . in this manner ,",
    "a precise dependence relation between this degradation of quantum correlations and the choice of superselection parameter @xmath0 would be presented . comparing with standard bunch - davies choice , we find that the possible planckian physics causes some extra decrement on the quantum correlations . as quantum entanglement can be used to encode the information of these modifications from planckian physics , it is important to design an operational rqi tasks to probe the physics at fundamental scales @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , many previous rqi works assumed the so - called single - mode approximation ( sma ) where the single - particle states of inertial observer are related to states in rindler basis , therefore the minkowskian annihilation operator is taken to be one of the right or left moving unruh modes .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown @xcite that this does not hold for general states , since the bogoliubov coefficients appearing in mode - mixing are not localized in frequency . with this in mind , beside the planckian modification , our investigation on the behavior of quantum correlations is made beyond the sma , by properly constructing unruh modes related with @xmath1states in global chart of de sitter space .",
    "for instance , for a fixed @xmath0 , we show that bosonic entanglement always vanishes in the infinite - curvature limit with @xmath11 .",
    "there is no fundamental difference in the degradation of entanglement for different choices of unruh mode , which means the entanglement degrades with hubble scale at same rate .    in particular",
    ", we unveil an unexpected interesting link between choice of @xmath0 and the asymptotic behavior of fermionic entanglement . for",
    "a particular fermionic @xmath0-vacuum , fermionic entanglement with different choice of unruh mode would converge to a fixed point @xmath2 determined by @xmath0 . for bunch - davies choice with @xmath12",
    ", we have @xmath13 consist with the results in minkowski space @xcite , while @xmath2 is finite for non - trivial @xmath0-vacua .",
    "interestingly , the amount of fermionic entanglement at @xmath2 is a nonvanishing constant independent with choice of unruh mode and initial vacuum .    to further explore the physical meaning of the convergent point @xmath2",
    ", we employ a particular class of fermionic quantum communication channels , the so - called grassmann channels @xcite , for quantum information transmission purposes in de sitter space .",
    "we calculate the classical and quantum capacity which measure the ability of the channels to transmit classical or quantum correlation , and show that the quantum capacity of grassmann channels would be vanishing at exactly the same critical value @xmath2 where fermionic entanglement converges . therefore , from the view of quantum information",
    ", we conclude that a nontrivial choice of @xmath0 could be characterized by the vanishing quantum capacity of grassmann channels in de sitter spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , as quantum correlation transmission is forbidden beyond @xmath2 , we show that the classical capacity of grassmann channel is always nonnegative unless @xmath14 , which means classical correlation could be transmitted in the channel until the spacetime curvature approach to infinity .",
    "moreover , we also show that the quantum capacity of a bosonic channel is always nonnegative , that is very different from fermionic case due to their distinct statistics .",
    "nevertheless , by identifying @xmath15 for bosonic entanglement , we show that the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath2 and the zeros of quantum capacity is universal for both bosonic and fermionic field .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first review the planckian physics in de sitter space by the boundary condition approach .",
    "then we analyze the thermality of general @xmath1vacua by constructing the proper unruh modes and related mottola - allen transformations , based on which the one - particle excited states for bosonic / fermionic field are given explicitly . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the behavior of quantum correlations of bosonic field in static frame with planckian modifications and show that the pattern of degradation of quantum correlations is depend on the particular choice of initial vacuum . in sec .",
    "iv , similar analysis on the quantum correlations of fermonic fields is given .",
    "the convergent feature of entanglement for various @xmath0 is studied . in sec .",
    "v , we explore the grassmann quantum channel for fermionic modes and calculate its classical / quantum capacity .",
    "in particular , we find that the convergent point for fermionic entanglement correspond to a quantum channel with vanishing quantum capacity , determined by a unique planck - scale cutoff denoted by @xmath0 . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we summarise our results and discuss some open problems .",
    "while de sitter space has the same number of isometries as minkowski space , quantum field theories in this dynamic background is much complicated by the non - trivial definition of unambiguous vacuum . in the absence of a global timelike killing vector , many criteria could be applied to choose a particular vacuum .",
    "for instance , one could demand that the vacuum state should be annihilated by the generators of the de sitter isometry group @xmath16 . here",
    "we review the boundary condition approach to planckian physics in de sitter space .",
    "consider a free scalar field in de sitter space , which satisfy the wave equation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the dalembert operator in curved space .",
    "the explicit form of the effective mass @xmath19 depends on its coupling with background .",
    "for instance , a conformally coupled scalar field in four - dimension gives @xmath20 .",
    "after the canonical quantization , the field can be expanded with respect to positive and negative - frequency modes in a fock representation @xmath21 \\label{modeboson}\\ ] ] the vacuum state is defined by @xmath22 and should respect the spacetime isometries . to specifying mode functions @xmath23 , one must solve the field equation with some affiliated coordinate systems for different observers .    in inflation regime ,",
    "a conformal observer adopts planar coordinates which reduce the de sitter metric as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is conformal time .",
    "the coordinates cover the upper right triangle of the carter - penrose diagram , while the complete manifold could be covered using the antipodal map @xmath26 , as depicted in fig.[penrose ] . in inflation regime ,",
    "one usually considers the coordinate patch with @xmath27 and traces over the other patch",
    ".     would observe the event horizon at @xmath28 . to construct the proper unruh modes , the kruskal coordinates @xmath29 , @xmath30 is also denoted . considering a bipartite system of alice and",
    "rob comoving with respect to conformal time initially .",
    "if rob turns to be static in region i while alice maintains its move with respect to @xmath31 , a degradation of quantum correlation due to gibbons - hawking effect should be observed for rob . ]",
    "since the space is alway accelerated expanding , it follows that the wavelength of field mode could become arbitrary smaller than the curvature radius if one goes backwards in conformal time far enough . in the limit @xmath32 , the mode functions reduce to the adiabatic modes defined in flat space and satisfy @xmath33 , which means any distinction between de sitter space and minkowski space",
    "should be suppressed then .",
    "the corresponding bunch - davies vacuum @xmath34 , which matches the conformal vacuum of minkowski space in same limit , therefore becomes essentially unique . since its invariance under de sitter isometries ,",
    "the bunch - davies vacuum is always chosen as initial state to estimate the primordial power spectrum of inflationary perturbations .    however , as we mentioned before , the existence of fundamental planck scale , where the unknown quantum gravitational effects become important , prevents us from following a mode back unlimited . to estimate the latest time with planckian physics @xcite , a cutoff on physical momentum",
    "could be made as @xmath35 , where @xmath6 refers to planckian energy scale . with scale factor",
    "@xmath36 read from ( [ confmetric ] ) , one has the conformal time as @xmath37 when the boundary condition is imposed to redefine the vacuum state for the conformal observer as @xmath38 .",
    "it should be noted that this new vacuum is in general different from bunch - davies ( but recover the later by taking @xmath39 ) and is a direct result of new physics at planck scale . moreover , since the mode expansion ( [ modeboson ] ) admits both vacua , this new vacuum could be formally realized as a squeezed state over bunch - davies like @xmath40 without a complete theory of quantum gravity , this boundary condition on vacuum of comoving observer can still provide a typical signature of planck physics by modify the spectrum of quantum fluctuations after inflation .",
    "for instance , it was shown @xcite that the power spectrum @xmath41 with respect to the new vacuum would be modified like @xmath42 , which is expected to be observed in wmap or planck satellite experiments .",
    "more ambitious view is that above argument indeed provides an one - parameter family of vacua with the single parameter given by the fundamental scale ( planckian or stringy ) .",
    "equivalently , this allows us to discuss the boundary condition from quantum gravity in terms of so - called @xmath0-vacua which have been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "consider a new set of mode basis related with bunch - davies one by mottola - allen ( ma ) transformation @xmath43\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is an arbitrary complex number with re@xmath44 , @xmath45 .",

    "these @xmath0-vacua preserve all @xmath48 de sitter isometries .",
    "as re@xmath12 , @xmath49 which indicates the bunch - davies vacuum is included in this one - parameter family of vacua .",
    "taking into account that @xmath50 and the commutation relation @xmath51=\\delta_{kk'}$ ] , the boundary condition ( [ bc2 ] ) can now be resolved as a single - mode squeezing transformation |0^_k",

    "since the time - reversal invariance of theory requires @xmath0 be real , we henceforth adopt @xmath53re@xmath0 for simplicity .",
    "similarly , a fermionic analogous of @xmath0-vacua could be defined for a free massive fermionic field , satisfying the wave equation @xmath54\\psi=0 $ ] , where @xmath55 is spin connection .",

    "the fermionic @xmath0-vacua are defined by @xmath60 , which are also invariant under de sitter isometries .",
    "the boundary condition now becomes |0^_k = s()|0_k=|0_k[bcfermion ] where squeezing operator gives the correct ma transformation ( [ mafermi ] ) by (    c b^_k + c^_k    ) = s ( ) (    c b_k + c^_k    ) s()^[squez3 ] with squeezing parameter is @xmath61 .",
    "strictly speaking , only a small set of de sitter @xmath0-vacua could be chosen as an alternative initial state rather than bunch - davies .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is constrained by the fundamental scale putting in possible quantum gravity model . from ( [ bc1 ] ) , ( [ bcboson ] ) and ( [ bcfermion ] ) , it could be estimated @xcite e^~ [ estimate ]      since the bunch - davies vacuum appears thermal with @xmath3 for static observer , it is clear that both bosonic and fermionic @xmath0-vacua would exhibit some non - thermal feature since the corrections from ma transformations ( [ maboson ] ) and ( [ mafermi ] ) .",
    "such deviations from pure thermal spectrum are believed to provide a robust signal from planckian physics in power spectrum of fluctuation after inflation @xcite . to investigate how these modifications affect rqi processing",
    ", we need to obtain the excited states of bosonic / fermionic modes during the particle creation near the cosmological horizon .    in old rqi literature ,",
    "a highly idealized scenario so - called the single - mode approximation ( sma ) was always employed ( see @xcite also @xcite ) , which means minkowski annihilation operator is identified to the right unruh modes , and both the inertial and the non - inertial observer would be sensitive only to a same frequency of quantum fields .",
    "however , as was first attained in ref .",
    "@xcite , this may fail to be valid for general states , e.g. , a single frequency minkowski mode is related to a rindler mode which corresponds to a highly non - monochromatic field excitation . in parallel with the case of flat space , we relax the sma in de sitter space by constructing the unruh modes for bosonic and fermionic fields respectively .",
    "for an inertial observer with static coordinates , de sitter metric becomes ds^2=-(1-r^2h^2)dt^2+(1-r^2h^2)^-1dr^2+r^2d^2 [ static ] which covers half of the region of conformal coordinates denoted as region i in fig .",
    "[ penrose ] .",

    "it s well known that the same quantum field can be expanded with respect to different coordinates . for a static observer situated in region i , we define bosonic mode @xmath66 , fermionic modes @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where the subscripts denote the frequency @xmath69 . for completeness ,",
    "one also need modes in spacelike separated region iv as @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . the related field operators should satisfy commutation relation @xmath73=\\delta_{\\omega,\\omega'}\\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}$ ] for bosonic field , and anticommutation relations @xmath74 for fermionic field , where @xmath75 . obviously",

    "therefore , it is more convenient to employ kruskal coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 and make an analytic continuation to the whole de sitter hyperboloid @xcite = ( -h(t+r_*)),=(h(t - r _ * ) ) where @xmath78 is tortoise coordinate , and upper / lower signs refer to right(r)/left(l ) rindler wedges . in these coordinates ,",

    "after alice makes a joint projective measurement on her two logical qubits , the results of measurement could be sent from alice for rob who can then recover the unknown state by applying a proper unitary transformation on his qubit and complete the protocol in his local frame .",
    "such a teleportation process in de sitter space should be indeed influenced by the local gibbons - hawking radiation detected by rob .",
    "moreover , additional modification from the existence of minimal fundamental scale should also be taken into account if one starts from general @xmath0-vacua rather than the bunch - davies choice .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can compare different choice of de sitter vacua by the fidelity of transferred state , which has intrinsic relation to quantum channel capacity @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time that quantum correlations , in particular quantum entanglement , not only plays a key role in quantum information science , but can also provide powerful means for other research areas such as condensed matter physics and cosmology @xcite . in this paper , we give a new interpretation this universality to the physics at some fundamental scales , like planckian or stringy , by its influence on quantum correlations in certain quantum information tasks . we analyze the quantum correlations of free fields in de sitter space , while the planckian modifications presented by vacuum ambiguity has been considered . beside the existence of degradation behavior of entanglement same as in previous rqi works @xcite ,",
    "we exploit some new features appearing in de sitter background .",
    "firstly , we show that the correction from fundamental scale are encoded in patterns of degradation of quantum correlations for a static observer in de sitter space . comparing with the bunch - davies choice , the possible",
    "planckian physics cause some extra decrement on the quantum correlation , which may provides the means to detect quantum gravitational effects via quantum information methodology .",
    "secondly , by constructing proper unruh modes respect @xmath1vacua beyond sma , we show the convergent feature of negativity of both bosonic and fermionic entanglement .",
    "in particular , for fermionic entanglement , we find that the convergent points @xmath2 are dependent on the choice of @xmath0 . to explore the physical meaning of @xmath2",
    ", we construct grassmann quantum channel between alice and rob in de sitter space , and show that the quantum capacity of channel becomes vanishing at these convergent points , which means no quantum correlations could be transmitted in de sitter space . on the other hand , for a bosonic unruh channel in de sitter space , we show that the quantum capacity of an unruh channel is always positive and becomes vanishing at @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , ultimately , we prove that the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath2 and the zeros of quantum capacity is universal for both bosonic and fermionic field .    in this work ,",
    "we employ the bogoliubov transformation technology wildly used in rqi literature to analyze the global modes in spacetime .",
    "this method allow us to exploit the general @xmath1states quite straightforwardly as the ma transformation utilizing antipodal map over whole de sitter manifold @xcite . to consider a more physical scenario , it is more satisfactory to use local particle detectors approach as in @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , such detector picture ( especially for general @xmath0-state ) in de sitter space still suffer from its ill - defined renormalizability and stability .",
    "while there are some clues to this problem ( with specific operators ordering in propagator ) already @xcite , it would be very interesting to investigate the rqi in this framework in future .    at the present stage ,",
    "we have considered a standard de sitter spacetime with constant curvature , therefore the parameter @xmath148 for bosonic field and @xmath200 fro fermionic field depend only on the @xmath88 of fields and time - independent hawking temperature @xmath270 ( cf .",
    "( [ u - s ] ) and ( [ u - s - f ] ) ) . in a real inflation model ,",
    "the quantum correlation between field modes , especially between cosmological perturbation , suffer a more complicate decoherence .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis present in this work could be straightly generalized to that case @xcite , which may shed new light on the problem of quantum - to - classical transition of the perturbations . in particular , starting from different choice of initial state , the quantum communication in cosmological background should be influenced , indicated by the channel s capacity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , with respect to @xmath0-vacua , backreaction acts to increase the de sitter horizon and therefore makes de sitter taller @xcite . in an expanding universe",
    ", backreaction would impose constraints on short distance effects in the cmb @xcite .",
    "therefore when discuss the possible planckian modification on quantum communication in universe , the constraints from backreaction should be taken into account .",
    "we will explore all these issues elsewhere in future .",
    "the design of the intelligent rqi experiments is of course the next challenging open problem @xcite .",
    "recently developed quantum metrology for relativistic quantum fields @xcite may open a new window to directly detection of extremal sensitive planckian effects .",
    "on the other hand , a more pragmatic approach is to simulate these planckian modifications by analogue gravity experiments , like using ion trap . in detector picture",
    "@xcite , replacing the conformal time @xmath31 with the experimenter s clock time , the detector should evolve with respect to the simulated proper time @xmath65 which is equal to the cosmic time . to simulate vacuum ambiguity , the detector s",
    "response function represents the probability for an ion excited by interaction with the field . for general @xmath10 , the standard wightman function",
    "would be modified @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ion analogue of this function @xmath271 should be evaluated in some motional - state@xcite , since the @xmath0-vacua can be interpreted as squeezed states over bunch - davies vacuum state .",
