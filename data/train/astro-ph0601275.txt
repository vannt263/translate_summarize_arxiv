    "with the advent of the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) , we are on the verge of an era of gravitational - wave astronomy  @xcite . among the most interesting expected sources for gw observatories are the inspirals and mergers of compact - object binaries .",
    "ligo - ii , a planned upgrade with tenfold increase in sensitivity , can detect the inspirals and coalescence of stellar - mass binaries within several hundred megaparsecs , while the laser interferometer space antenna ( _ lisa _ ) can study supermassive binary bhs ( @xmath7 ) throughout the universe ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the idea of using gw measurements of coalescing binaries to make cosmologically interesting measurements has a long history .",
    "as originally pointed out by @xcite , observation of the gravitational radiation from an inspiraling binary provides a self - calibrated absolute distance determination to the source . @xcite and @xcite took advantage of this property to show how , by observing many inspiral sources",
    ", one can construct the distribution of observed binary mass and gw signal strength , and thereby statistically constrain the values of cosmological parameters .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that _",
    "lisa _  observations of well - localized supermassive binary black hole ( smbbh ) inspirals allow cosmological distance determination with unprecedented accuracy , with typical errors @xmath9 .",
    "these gw `` standard sirens '' can precisely map out the expansion history of the universe , offering a powerful probe of the dark energy .",
    "the utility of standard sirens for constraining dark energy is quite similar to that of standard candles , like type - ia supernovae .",
    "one advantage of gw standard sirens is that the underlying physics is well - understood .",
    "the radiation emitted during the inspiral phase ( as opposed to the merger phase ) is well described using the post - newtonian expansion of general relativity for the bh binary @xcite .",
    "hence some unknown systematic evolution of the standard sirens over time , mimicking a different cosmology , should not be of concern .",
    "another advantage is that gw observatories directly measure absolutely calibrated source distances , whereas type - ia supernova standard candles provide only relatively calibrated distances .",
    "a major drawback of gw standard sirens is that , although the gravitational waveforms measure distance directly , they contain no redshift information . to be useful as a standard candle , an independent measure of the redshift to",
    "the source is crucial .",
    "this can be determined through observation of an electromagnetic counterpart , such as the host galaxy of the source .",
    "unfortunately , as gw observatories are essentially all - sky , they generally provide poor source localization , and the host galaxy is not always unambiguously identifiable @xcite . in cases where source redshifts can not be determined ,",
    "the distribution of unlocalized events can be used to place statistical bounds on cosmological parameters @xcite . however , in this paper we will focus upon gw sirens whose redshifts may be measured , as they can provide very tight constraints on cosmology .    because standard siren distances are absolutely calibrated , even sources at low redshift ( e.g.  @xmath10 )",
    "can constrain dark energy .",
    "this may seem surprising , since at low redshifts the distance - redshift relation is well - described by a linear hubble relation @xmath11 , independent of dark energy parameters . as emphasized by @xcite and @xcite , however",
    ", absolute distances to sources at low redshift tightly constrain dark energy , when combined with a determination of the absolute distance to the last - scattering surface of the cosmic microwave background . to understand this",
    ", note that cosmological distances are given by a redshift integral of the hubble parameter , which in turn depends on the sum of energy densities at each redshift : @xmath12 \\\\ \\frac{h(z)}{h_0}&= & \\sqrt{\\omega_m(1+z)^3+\\omega_{\\rm de}(1+z)^{3(1+w)}+\\omega_k(1+z)^2}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 , @xmath14 km / s / mpc is the hubble constant today , and we have assumed a constant equation of state parameter @xmath3 . if we assume a flat universe ( @xmath15 ) , then @xmath16 , and the only parameters describing the global expansion are @xmath1 , @xmath17 , and @xmath3 .",
    "observations of the primary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) provide two constraints on these three parameters .",
    "first , the heights of the acoustic peaks determine the matter density ( in g/@xmath18 ) , which fixes @xmath19 .",
    "second , the angular scale of the peaks ( their location in @xmath20-space ) precisely measures the angular diameter distance to the cmb last - scattering surface , in mpc .",
    "absolute distances to low - redshift sources measure the hubble constant @xmath1 , which then allows all three parameters to be determined @xcite .",
    "clearly the constraints we present would be substantially degraded if the curvature were not fixed to zero ; see @xcite for the prospects for precise constraints on curvature .",
    "in addition to the low redshift standard sirens , those at higher redshifts also help constrain dark energy , in the same manner as high - redshift standard candles .",
    "@xcite discuss how _",
    "_  observations of smbbh inspirals can help constrain cosmology . for a dark energy model which is not dramatically different from a cosmological constant @xmath21 ,",
    "the interesting redshift range is when the dark energy density is significant ( @xmath22 ) , although note that gravitational lensing degrades the constraints from the highest redshift standard sirens ( or candles )  @xcite .    as mentioned above , the gravitational waves from standard sirens measure source distances , but do not measure source redshifts . some sort of electromagnetic counterpart associated with the merger event will generally be required to use gw sources to determine cosmology .",
    "one potential class of gw sources guaranteed to have electromagnetic counterparts are short @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "these sources are thought to arise in the mergers of neutron star ( ns ) binaries , and hence should be strong gw emitters in the frequency band accessible to ground - based observatories .",
    "the grb counterpart to these gw source provides a precise sky localization , which is useful both for determining the redshift to the source , and for significantly improving the gw determination of absolute distance . as we discuss below",
    ", short grbs occur at a rate large enough for them to provide interesting cosmological constraints .",
    "in this section we briefly review how distances to inspiraling binaries may be determined ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail .",
    "an inspiraling binary at direction @xmath23 on the sky , with orbital angular momentum axis @xmath24 , generates gravitational waves with strain tensor @xmath25 where the basis tensors are @xmath26 with @xmath27 our convention is that @xmath23 points towards the source , hence the waves propagate in the direction @xmath28 .",
    "we can express the amplitudes of the two polarizations @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the frequency domain as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cosine of the inclination angle of the binary , and @xmath33^{5/6}\\frac{c}{d}f^{-7/6}\\exp[i\\psi(f)].\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath34 is the luminosity distance to the source , and @xmath35^{3/5}/(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}$ ] is the redshifted chirp mass of the binary . the phase @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the time at coalescence , and @xmath39 is the orbital phase at coalescence .",
    "these expressions describe a binary s waves only in the newtonian , quadrupole approximation  treating the binary s kinematics as due to newtonian gravity and using the quadrupole formula to estimate its gw emission .",
    "because the phase parameters are essentially uncorrelated from the amplitude parameters , this approximation is good enough to estimate the expected signal - to - noise ratio from a source , and provides a good estimate of the distance measurement accuracy , but is not accurate enough to reliably model the detailed gw waveform @xcite .",
    "higher order post - newtonian templates ( see ref.@xcite for detailed discussion ) should be sufficiently accurate , and are used for the actual data analysis .    given @xmath40 ,",
    "the measured strain is given by @xmath41 where the detector response tensor for an interferometer with arms @xmath42 and @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , a detector at colatitude @xmath45 and longitude @xmath46 with orientation @xmath47 has response tensor @xmath48/2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\sin(2\\alpha ) [ \\bm{e}_\\theta\\otimes\\bm{e}_\\theta - \\bm{e}_\\phi\\otimes\\bm{e}_\\phi]/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to recap , the source parameters determining the measured signal are distance @xmath34 , chirp mass @xmath49 , coalescence time @xmath38 , coalescence phase @xmath39 , source direction @xmath23 , and orbital axis @xmath24 .",
    "these are the 8 parameters to be determined from the data timestream @xmath50 .",
    "if the detector has strain noise with spectral density @xmath51 , then the incident strain is measured with signal - to - noise ratio snr ( assuming wiener filtering ) : @xmath52 the complicated angular dependence is hidden within the measured strain @xmath53 .",
    "this dependence can be made more explicit by rewriting the above equation as @xcite @xmath54 i_7\\ ; , \\label{eq : snr3}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 here @xmath59 hz is the frequency below which the detectors sensitivities are badly degraded by ground motions . in the optimal case ,",
    "the binary is face - on ( @xmath60 ) and directly overhead , so that @xmath61 .",
    "this gives @xmath62 if instead we average over all sky positions and binary orientations , we find @xmath63 where we have made use of @xmath64 and @xmath65 note that the snr in the optimal geometry is a factor 5/2 times larger than that for the average geometry .",
    "also note that face - on sources , when averaged over all sky positions , have snr a factor @xmath66 larger than snr@xmath67 .",
    "we can estimate how well the parameters @xmath68 are measured using the fisher matrix @xmath69 df,\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 denotes complex conjugation . approximating the likelihood as @xmath72 then the error on parameter @xmath73",
    "is given by @xmath74 .",
    "prior constraints , or the constraints from multiple detectors are implemented by multiplying the respective likelihoods , which in this approximation reduces to summing the respective fisher matrices . in our calculations , we compute the partial derivatives numerically by finite differencing .    in practice , the ` phase ' parameters @xmath49 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are determined with exquisite precision .",
    "the ` amplitude ' parameters @xmath34 , @xmath24 , and @xmath23 are determined less well , in large part due to parameter degeneracies . by using multiple detectors many of these degeneracies can be broken .",
    "for example , timing information from a network of detectors helps determine the source direction @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , if the detectors have different response tensors @xmath75 , then the polarization of the gw signal may be measured , which constrains the orbital axis @xmath24 ( c.f .",
    "( [ pol ] ) ) .",
    "short grbs are an extremely promising source of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "these sources have been of great interest recently , due to the prompt localization of the events by the _ _",
    "swift__@xcite and _ _ hete-2 _ _ @xcite satellites , allowing their detection in x - ray , optical , and radio frequencies . particularly exciting has been the identification of several galaxies hosting short bursts @xcite .",
    "while the nature of short grbs is not yet known , a leading candidate is the merger of neutron star binaries @xcite , although other models have been proposed as well @xcite .",
    "the detection or non - detection of grbs in gravitational waves would of course be extremely useful @xcite , for example confirming or refuting the ns - ns merger scenario , or determining the extent of collimation of the @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .    additionally , as mentioned above , short grbs",
    "can also be very useful for determining the background cosmology by acting as gw standard sirens .",
    "one immediate advantage offered by grbs is that their bright electromagnetic emission allows a precise localization of the source on the sky , pinpointing the source direction @xmath23 and lifting some of the degeneracies which limit distance determination .",
    "the extent of collimation in short grbs is not well known , though indications of beaming are claimed in at least one short grb so far @xcite .",
    "the theoretical expectation is that emission should be beamed preferentially along the orbital angular momentum axis where baryon loading is minimized .",
    "if this is the case , then we might expect short grbs to be nearly face - on , @xmath76 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) this maximizes the amplitudes of both polarizations and hence maximizes the snr of the detection for a given source direction @xmath23 . in what follows",
    ", we will compute distance errors for two cases : ( 1 ) isotropic distribution of @xmath24 , and ( 2 ) collimation , assuming an inclination probability distribution @xmath77 for @xmath78 , corresponding to a roughly @xmath79 jet angle .",
    "the expected chirp mass for grbs , @xmath80 , places them favorably in the frequency band accessible to ground - based gw observatories .",
    "several such observatories are now operating or are planned for construction in the near future .",
    "ligo  is already operational , and its sensitivity should increase by an order of magnitude in a planned upgrade ( ligo - ii ) @xcite .",
    "a detector of similar scale , virgo  @xcite , is under construction in italy , and there are plans for a similar detector , aigo@xcite , in australia . the locations and orientations of these observatories are listed in table  [ coords ] .",
    "the two ligodetectors are oriented to have very similar response tensors , and therefore have limited ability to independently measure polarization ( and hence inclination ) .",
    "determining @xmath24 will thus require the combination of ligo  with other observatories .",
    "henceforth , we assume that all four detectors will observe grb events ; in subsequent work we intend to investigate how the distance errors degrade if one or more elements of this network are removed .",
    "preliminary results indicate that reducing the size of the detector network does not substantially degrade our ability to determine distance ( aside from the loss in total snr ) _ assuming that we can set a prior on the beaming factor _ ( and hence on the inclination angle ) .",
    "if we can not set such a prior , then losing sites in this network badly degrades our ability to determine distance to these sources .",
    "we emphasize this point to highlight the importance of modeling bursts , and the importance of having widely separated gw detectors around the globe .",

    "when computing the fisher matrix we replace the parameter pair @xmath81 with the pair @xmath82 , to avoid singularities in the limit @xmath83 when @xmath84 and @xmath34 become degenerate @xcite .",
    "another difficulty that arises in the face - on limit is that the position angle of @xmath24 , denoted @xmath85 by ref .",
    "@xcite , becomes meaningless as @xmath86 . including it as a parameter would cause the fisher matrix to become singular in the face - on limit",
    "; we circumvent this difficulty using singular value decomposition to invert the fisher matrix , zeroing any eigenvalue whose magnitude is @xmath87 times that of the largest eigenvalue .    because the antenna response of each detector varies strongly with source direction @xmath23 , the parameter errors at",
    "any given distance @xmath34 also depend strongly on @xmath23 .",
    "we are interested only in average errors as a function of @xmath34 ; hence , for each @xmath34 we average over 100 different orientations @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "for example , fig .",

    "[ d_errs],scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "as discussed in  1 , a measurement of the hubble constant @xmath1 using grbs , when combined with cmb constraints , also constrains dark energy parameters .",
    "we use two measurements from the cmb : determination of the angular scale of the acoustic peaks @xmath95 , and determination of the matter density @xmath19 from the peak heights .",
    "currently , the _ wmap _ satellite has measured @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xcite . the error on @xmath19 will soon decrease by a factor @xmath98 with the 3rd year release of _ wmap _ data .",

    ", we assume that short grbs occur at a constant comoving rate of 10 gpc@xmath110 yr@xmath111 @xcite .",
    "we found in the previous section that the snr in distance determination per source scales roughly like @xmath112 .",
    "since the number of sources scales with volume @xmath113 , we expect the snr on the hubble constant @xmath1 to scale like @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the maximum distance to which grbs may be detected as gravitational wave sources .",
    "the standard threshold used in the gw literature for detection has been snr @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this high threshold is that sources are detected by correlating the data timestream with large numbers ( e.g. @xmath117 ) of templates corresponding to different parameter values , and therefore the detection threshold must be set high to avoid excessive numbers of false detections .",
    "such large numbers of templates are required in order to fully explore parameter space .",
    "for grb sources , however , the parameter space to be searched is considerably reduced : the @xmath0-ray burst itself determines the source direction @xmath23 and time @xmath38 . depending upon one s confidence in theoretical models for grbs",
    ", the chirp mass @xmath49 and orientation @xmath24 may also constrained .",
    "because many fewer templates need to be run for grb sources , we should set the detection threshold correspondingly lower .",
    "we conservatively estimate that knowledge of the grb time reduces the number of required templates by a factor @xmath118 , corresponding to a reduced threshold snr @xmath119 .",
    "note that this is the _ total _ snr ; since we have assumed a network of four detectors with identical noise , this translates into a threshold snr @xmath120 per detector . from this",

    "therefore the maximum distance for which snr@xmath124 is @xmath125 mpc .     and @xmath3 as a function of grb exposure , assuming _ planck_-quality errors from cmb .",
    "solid curves are for @xmath126 , the error on the hubble constant , while dashed curves correspond to @xmath127 , for the dark energy equation of state parameter .",

    "quite rapidly , the limiting error on @xmath3 becomes the uncertainty in cmb ( in this figure , fractional errors of 1% on @xmath19 were assumed ) .",
    "unless cmb errors can be significantly improved , it will be difficult for low - redshift gw sources to constrain @xmath3 to better than the @xmath132 level .",
    "higher redshift standard sirens would probe departures of the cosmic expansion from linear hubble scaling , and thereby directly constrain parameters like @xmath17 and @xmath3 . unfortunately , stellar - mass inspirals at high redshift are not sufficiently luminous to be detected by any existing or planned gw observatory .",
    "inspirals involving supermassive black hole binaries , however , are sufficiently luminous in gravitational waves to be detected at cosmological distances . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "_ lisa _  observations of smbbh inspirals can in principle measure distances to better than 1% accuracy .",
    "this precision is degraded , however , by gravitational lensing caused by density fluctuations from large - scale structure along the line of sight to the source .",
    "another difficulty in using _",
    "observations is that , unlike in the case of short grbs , for smbbhs there are no guaranteed electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "however , it has been argued that many smbbh mergers will be followed by bright quasar - like activity @xcite , or possibly preceded by optical emission @xcite , which will localize the gw source on the sky and provide a source redshift .    due to lensing errors ,",
    "small numbers of _ lisa _  sources will generally be unable to constrain dark energy parameters significantly @xcite .",
    "the effects of lensing diminish significantly at lower redshifts , so a single smbbh inspiral at @xmath133 observed by _ lisa _  could measure the hubble constant to @xmath134 and @xmath3 to @xmath135 .",
