    "* diagonalize the full hamiltonian @xmath6 on a connected graph consisting of @xmath7 clusters and obtain its low - energy states @xmath8 with energies @xmath9 . *",
    "the eigenstates @xmath8 are projected on the tensor product space of the states kept and gram - schmidt orthonormalized in order to get a basis @xmath10 of dimension @xmath11 .",
    "as it may happen that some of the eigenstates have zero or very small projection , or vanish after the orthogonalization it might be necessary to obtain more than just @xmath11 exact eigenstates . * next , the effective hamiltonian for this graph is built as @xmath12 * the connected range-@xmath7 interactions @xmath13 are determined by substracting the contributions of all connected subclusters .",
    "* finally , the effective hamiltonian is given by a cluster expansion as @xmath14    this effective hamiltonian _ exactly _ reproduces the low - energy physics provided the expansion goes to infinity .",
    "however , if the interactions are short - range in the starting hamiltonian , we can expect that these operators will become smaller and smaller , at least in certain situations . in the following",
    ", we will truncate at range @xmath15 and verify the convergence in several cases .",
    "this convergence naturally depends on the number @xmath5 of low - lying states that are kept on a basic block . in order to describe quantitatively how `` good '' these states are , we introduce the density matrix in section  [ sec:2d ] .    when the number of blocks increases , a full diagonalization is not always easy and one is tempted to use a lanczos algorithm in order to compute the low - lying eigenstates . in that case , one has to be very careful to resolve the correct degeneracies , which is known to be a difficult task in the lanczos framework . in practice",
    "such degeneracies arise when the cluster to be diagonalized is highly symmetric .",
    "if the degeneracies are ignored , often a wrong effective hamiltonian with broken su(2 ) symmetry is obtained . as a consequence we recommend to use specialized ` lapack ` routines whenever possible .    in the present work",
    "we investigate mainly su(2 ) invariant heisenberg models described by the usual hamiltonian @xmath16 where the exchange constants @xmath17 will be limited to short - range distances in the following . as a consequence of the su(2 ) symmetry ,",
    "the total spin of all states is a good quantum number .",
    "this also has some effects when calculating the effective hamiltonian .",
    "it is possible to have situations where a low energy state has a non - zero overlap with the tensor product basis , but gets eliminated by the orthogonalization procedure because one has already exhausted all the states in one particular total spin sector by projecting states with lower energy .    once an effective hamiltonian has been obtained , it is still a formidable task to determine its properties . within the core method different routes have been taken in the past . in their pioneering papers morningstar and weinstein have chosen to iteratively apply the core method on the preceding effective hamiltonian in order to flow to a fixed point and then to analyze the fixed point .",

    "[ ] : there the effective hamiltonian after one or two iterations has been analyzed with mean - field like methods and interesting results have been obtained . yet another",

    "it rapidly goes through zero ( @xmath113 ) and levels off to roughly -7 times the value predicted by perturbation theory as one approaches @xmath107 . in this case it is rather obvious that this coefficient will dominate the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this behavior in the application to the @xmath4 magnet below .",
    "let us note that the behavior of the @xmath50 coefficient is mainly due to a rather large second order correction in perturbation theory .",
    "indeed we find good agreement with the values obtained in the perturbative approach of ref .",

    "these quantities have been discussed in great detail in previous studies of the @xmath0 antiferromagnet  @xcite .",

    "we have also simulated the core hamiltonian obtained above for @xmath4 . while the energy per site is reproduced roughly , unfortunately the spectrum does not resemble an antiferromagnetic spin model , i.e. the groundstate is polarized in the spin variables .",
    "this fact is at odds with preliminary exact diagonalization data on the original @xmath4 model @xcite .",
    "we therefore did not pursue the core study with this choice of the basis states any further .",
    "indeed , as suggested by the analysis of the density matrix and by the evolution of the spectrum of two coupled triangles , we consider this a breakdown example of a naive range - two core approximation .",
    "it is important to stress that the method indicates its failure in various quantities throughout the algorithm , therefore offering the possibility of detecting a possible breakdown .    as a remedy in the present case",
    "we have extended the basis states to include all the @xmath0 and @xmath4 states on a triangle ( i.e. keeping 20 out of 64 states ) .",
    "computations within this basis set are more demanding , but give a better agreement with the exact diagonalization results . at the present stage",
    "we can not decide whether the breakdown of the 4 states core basis is related only the core method or whether it implies that the @xmath0 and @xmath4 systems do not belong to the same phase .",
    "we have discussed extensively the use of a novel numerical technique - the so - called numerical contractor renormalization ( core ) method - in the context of low - dimensional quantum magnetism .",
    "this method consists of two steps : ( i ) building an effective hamiltonian acting on the low - energy degrees of freedom of some elementary block ; and ( ii ) studying this new model numerically on finite - size clusters , using a standard exact diagonalization or similar approach .    like in other real - space renormalization techniques",
    "the effective model usually contains longer range interactions",
    ". the numerical core procedure will be most efficient provided the effective interactions decay sufficiently fast .",
    "we discussed the validity of this assumption in several cases .    for ladder type geometries",
    ", we explicitely checked the accuracy of the effective models by increasing the range of the effective interactions until reaching convergence .",
    "both in the perturbative regime and in the isotropic case , our results on a 2-leg ladder and a 3-leg torus are in good agreement with previously established results .",
    "this rapid convergence might be due to the small correlation length that exists in these systems which both have a finite spin gap .    in two dimensions ,",
    "we have used the density matrix as a tool to check whether the restricted basis gives a good enough representation of the exact states .",
    "when this is the case , as for the plaquette lattice or the @xmath0 lattice , the lowest order range - two effective hamiltonian gives semi - quantitative results , even away from any perturbative regime .",
    "for example we can successfully describe the plaquette lattice , starting from the decoupled plaquette limit through the quantum phase transition to the nel ordered state at homogeneous coupling .",
    "furthermore we can also reproduce many aspects of the exotic low - energy physics of the @xmath0 lattice .    therefore within the core method , we can have both the advantage of working in a strongly reduced subspace and not being limited to the perturbative regime in certain cases .",
    "we thus believe that the numerical core method can be used systematically to explore possible ways of generating low - energy effective hamiltonians .",
    "an important field is for example the doped frustrated magnetic systems , where it is not easy to decide which states are important in a low - energy description , and therefore the density matrix might be a helpful tool .",
    "in this appendix we introduce the density matrix of a basic building block in a larger cluster of the fully interacting problem as a diagnostic tool to validate or invalidate a particular choice of retained states on the basic building block in the core approach .    in previous applications of the core method ,",
    "the choice of the states kept relied mostly on the spectrum of an isolated building block .",
    "while this usually gives reasonable results it is not a clear _ a priori _ where to place the cut - off in the spectrum .",
    "the density matrix of a `` system block '' embedded in a larger `` super block '' forms a key concept in the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm invented by s.r .",
    "white in 1992  @xcite and is at the heart of its success .",
    "based on this and related ideas @xcite we propose to monitor the density matrix of the basic building block embedded in a larger cluster and to retain these states exhausting a large fraction of the density matrix weight .",
    "consider now a subsystem @xmath116 embedded in a larger system @xmath117 .",
    "suppose that the overall system @xmath117 is in state @xmath118 ( e.g. the groundstate ) .",
    "we write the wavefunction as : @xmath119 where the sum index @xmath120 runs over all states in @xmath116 and index @xmath121 over all states in @xmath122 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath123 of the subsystem @xmath116 is then defined as @xmath124 the eigenvalues of @xmath123 denote the probability of finding a certain state @xmath120 in @xmath116 , given the overall system in state @xmath118 .",
    "practically we calculate the groundstate of the fully interacting system on a medium size cluster by exact diagonalization , and then obtain the density matrix of a basic building block , e.g. a four site plaquette .",
    "the density matrix of a building block is a rather local object , so we expect that results on intermediate size clusters are already accurate on the percent level .",
    "the density matrix spectra shown in figs .  [ fig : plaquettedensitymatrix ] and [ fig : triangledensitymatrix ] have been obtained in this way . in the models",
    "considered , a density matrix weight of the retained states of at least 90% yielded reasonable results within a range - two core approximation .",
    "it is possible to allow for a lower overall weight , at the expense of increasing the range of the core interactions .",
    "the calculation of observables beyond simple energy related quantities is not straightforward within the core method , as the observables need to be renormalized like the hamiltonian in the first place @xcite .",
    "a somewhat simpler approach for measurements of symmetry breaking order parameters consists in adding a small symmetry breaking field to the hamiltonian ( for a review see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "let us denote @xmath125 the extensive symmetry breaking operator , such that the order parameter is related to its gs average value @xmath126 .",
    "the occurence of a symmetry broken phase can be detected by adding this operator to the hamiltonian  : @xmath127 since on a finite - size lattice the order parameter vanishes by symmetry for @xmath128 , the ground - state energy per site varies quadratically for small @xmath129  : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is termed the corresponding generalized susceptibility . in that way",
    "the second derivative of the energy with respect to @xmath129 at @xmath128 offers one possibility to detect a finite order parameter in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "we found that another possibility to conveniently track the presence of a finite order parameter is to measure directly @xmath132 in finite field @xmath133 by the hellmann - feynman theorem . when plotting @xmath132 as a function of the rescaled field @xmath134 for various system sizes we observe an approximate crossing of the curves if there is a finite order parameter and no crossing in the absence of the order parameter .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss half - integer spin hamiltonians with triangles as the unit cell .",
    "the ground state manifold of each unit cell is generated by the four degenerate lowest states that can be built out of @xmath135 half - integer @xmath87 spins , namely the four @xmath136 states .",
    "the idea of selecting these states as a starting point to describe the whole system low energy properties was originally introduced by subrahmanyam for @xmath137  @xcite on the lattice and later used by mila  @xcite .",
    "more recently it was reintroduced by raghu _",
    "@xcite for arbitrary half - integer @xmath87 in the context of a chain of triangles .",
    "all these approaches are pertubative and state that the triangle couplings @xmath74 is much larger than the inter - triangle one @xmath73 .",
    "here we would like to discuss some general properties of any effective hamiltonian that can be derived either by perturbative methods or more sophisticated ones such as core .",
    "in particular , we would like to point out that a gauge invariance appears as a direct consequence of the state selection .      to be more specific ,",
    "let us label @xmath139,@xmath140,@xmath135 the sites of the triangle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : onetriangle ] ) . in order to build a total spin @xmath1 out of the three @xmath87 , spins @xmath140 and @xmath135 couple into a @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "the coupling with the remaining site @xmath139 produces a spin @xmath1 with chirality @xmath142 .",
    "note that this definition of chirality is equivalent to eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : toruschirality ] ) for spin @xmath0 up to a global unitary transform which is just a redefinition of the chirality quantification axis .    in the following ,",
    "the four selected spin - chirality states on a triangle @xmath143 will be denoted as @xmath144 .",
    "these states are the eigenstates of the @xmath145 components of spin @xmath39 and chirality @xmath37 ( both are spin 1/2 like operators ) with @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "let us now turn to the two - triangle problem .",
    "as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : twotriangles ] , the hamiltonian is invariant under reflections with respect to the @xmath148 axis .",
    "moreover , the reflection can be taken independently on each triangle . as a consequence ,",
    "both chiralities ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) are conserved by the effective hamiltonian and the @xmath151 part is of the form @xmath152 . for any fixed value of @xmath153 ,",
    "the total spin of the system is conserved and thus the spin part is @xmath43 invariant . as a conclusion the most general two - triangle hamiltonian allowed is of the form : @xmath154      _ gauge transformation : _ the form of the above hamiltonian is the consequence of the particular choice we made for labeling the sites of the triangle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twotriangles ] ) : site @xmath139 of triangle @xmath155 couples to site @xmath139 of triangle @xmath156 .",
    "although this gauge was convenient for the calculation , in general this choice can not be made simultaneously on all couples of triangles of the lattice .",
    "so , it is essential to derive the form of the hamiltonian in a generic situation where site @xmath157 of triangle @xmath155 couples to site @xmath158 of triangle @xmath156 .",
    "the unitary transformations involved in the redefinition of the coupling sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3j_symbols ] ) are covered by the @xmath159 symbols of elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "the problem of 3 half - integer spins @xmath87 coupled into a total spin @xmath1 occurs to be particularly simple and independent of @xmath87 .",
    "the form of the general effective hamiltonian then reads : @xmath160,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 , @xmath162 are three coplanar normalized vectors in a @xmath163 configuration ( for example , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 in the @xmath167 plane ) and @xmath120 , @xmath121 are the labels of the original spins coupling triangles @xmath168 and @xmath169 .    _ the lattice : _ in the particular geometry of the lattice [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices2d ] ( b ) ] , each triangular unit cell is coupled to six other triangular cells , each corner being coupled twice . as a consequence , for each cell the contribution involving only @xmath170 factorizes into @xmath171 .",

    "<S> these systems are driven by strong correlations and large quantum fluctuations - especially when frustration comes into play - and can exhibit various unconventional phases and quantum phase transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the major difficulties in trying to understand these systems is that strong correlations often generate highly non trivial low - energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> not only the groundstate of such models is generally not known but also the low - energy degrees of freedom can not be identified easily . moreover , among the techniques available to investigate these systems , not many have the required level of generality to provide a systematic way to derive low - energy effective hamiltonians .    </S>",
    "<S> recently the contractor renormalization ( core ) method has been introduced by morningstar and weinstein @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea of the approach is to derive an effective hamiltonian acting on a truncated local basis set , so as to exactly reproduce the low energy spectrum . in principle </S>",
    "<S> the method is exact in the low energy subspace , but only at the expense of having a priori long range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the method becomes most useful when one can significantly truncate a local basis set and still restrict oneself to short range effective interactions . </S>",

    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows : in the first section we will review the core algorithm in general and discuss some particularities in a numerical core approach , both at the level of the calculation of the effective hamiltonians and the subsequent simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> in section  [ sec : ladder ] we move to the first applications on one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems : the well known two - leg spin ladder and the 3-leg spin ladder with periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction ( 3-leg torus ) . both systems exhibit generically a finite spin gap and a finite magnetic correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the numerical core method is able to get rather accurate estimates of the groundstate energy and the spin gap by successively increasing the range of the effective interactions .    in section  [ sec:2d ] </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems . as in 2d </S>",
    "<S> a long ranged cluster expansion of the interactions is difficult to achieve on small clusters , we will discuss some techniques to analyze the quality of the basis truncation . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these issues on two model systems , the plaquette lattice and the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the plaquette lattice is of particular interest as it exhibits a quantum phase transition from a disordered plaquette state to a long range ordered nel antiferromagnet , which can not be reached by a perturbative approach . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a range - two effective model captures many aspects of the physics over the whole range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice on the other hand is a highly frustrated lattice built of corner - sharing triangles . for spin @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> it has been studied both numerically and analytically and it is one best - known candidate systems for a spin liquid groundstate . </S>",
    "<S> a very peculiar property is the exponentially large number of low - energy singlets in the magnetic gap . </S>",
    "<S> we show that already a basic range two core approach is able to devise an effective model which exhibits the same exotic low - energy physics . for higher half - integer spin , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath4 , this simple effective hamiltonian breaks down ; we analyze how to detect this , and discuss some ways to improve the results .    in the last section we conclude and give some perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> finally three appendices are devoted to ( i ) the density matrix of local building block , ( ii ) the calculation of observables by energy considerations and ( iii ) some general remarks on effective hamiltonians coupling antiferromagnetic half - integer spin triangles . </S>"
