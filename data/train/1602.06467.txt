    "network control is of utmost importance in many application fields , ranging from computer science to power networks , internet of things and systems biology @xcite , @xcite . in all such fields , the problem of steering the dynamics of network agents towards a coordinated behavior",
    "is recognized as a fundamental network control problem , @xcite .",
    "synchronization and consensus are two examples where all the agents of the network need to coordinate their actions in a decentralized way so that they all converge to the same behavior , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "consensus and synchronization are also at the core of distributed optimization algorithms , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein , where a set of agents _ collaborates _ to minimize a global cost function by only using some locally available information .    over the past few years",
    ", several sufficient conditions have been devised ensuring , under different technical assumptions , synchronization / consensus of complex networks .",
    "however , an assumption that is often made in literature is that the network of interest is _ noise - free_. this assumption is not realistic for most real world applications of synchronization and consensus , where noise plays a key role in destroying or generating those coordinated behaviors .",
    "networks of power generators communicating over transmission lines @xcite , neural networks @xcite , distributed estimation @xcite and cognitive processes @xcite are all examples of applications where noise can not be neglected .    motivated by this",
    ", the problem of controlling synchronization / consensus in networks affected by noise has recently attracted many researchers .",
    "for example , in @xcite the consensus problem is studied when the information exchanged among the network nodes is corrupted , while in @xcite coupled drift - diffusion models are used to investigate the dynamics of collective decision making processes . in all these papers , it is assumed that the noise affecting each node is additive with constant diffusion rate and that the dynamics at the network nodes are linear systems or integrators .",
    "recently , an approach to study synchronization in networks of nonlinear nodes subject to additive noise has been presented in @xcite",
    ". however , the key idea behind the methodology presented in this paper is to recast synchronization as a stochastic optimization problem and rely on numerical methods to solve it .    in this paper , we present new algebraic sufficient conditions ensuring that synchronization / consensus is attained for a given network .",
    "we will consider a wide class of networks relevant to applications where nodes dynamics are nonlinear and where the noise affecting nodes has a diffusion rate that can also be nonlinear and state dependent . by using lyapunov techniques @xcite ,",
    "we will first present a sufficient condition ensuring that a network synchronizes ( or achieves consensus ) in the presence of noise . our condition will explicitly link together network topology , coupling strength , node and diffusion dynamics and , intuitively",
    ", it will imply that network will achieve synchronization / consensus if the coupling strength and the network topology are well _ blended _ together so as to overcome a _ threshold _ generated by noise .",
    "then , we will show that , if properly _ designed _ , noise can be also turned into a _ distributed control input _ to induce synchronization / consensus .",
    "specifically , we will show that a given network of interest can be driven towards synchronization / consensus by designing an additional layer , where noise is _",
    "injected_. in essence , this new layer , which superimposes to the original network topology , controls the network by properly canalizing noise .",
    "interestingly , the new _ noise - propagation layer _ can have a topology different from the original network topology and , in principle , nodes might even be disconnected at the network level but connected through this newly designed layer . recently",
    ", multi - layer network control has been investigated in @xcite but in this case noise was seen as a disturbance to be rejected through the development of a distributed pi controller .",
    "our viewpoint is instead fundamentally different as we aim to _ embrace _ noise and make it useful for network control . to the best of our knowledge , the idea of designing an additional layer where noise can propagate to control a network is new in this literature . in developing this idea we have been inspired by our current research in smart cities and internet of things ( iot ) .",
    "for example , for such applications , it often the case where , due to physical / environmental constraints , the coupling strength between nodes needs to be low , and thus such networks , generally speaking , are unable to achieve consensus / synchronization . in this case",
    ", our results can be used to properly inject some noise that , combined with the existing couplings , induces synchronization .",
    "another motivation , particularly relevant of applications of control to _ iot _ , is that typically network nodes need to preserve some level of _ privacy_. this is , for example , the case in vehicles platooning , where a common speed needs to be found among a network of vehicles but where each driver is not willing to share his / her exact position , speed and utility function with the other drivers . in this case , with our results we can use noise in order to _ obfuscate _ private data so that no node knows the exact state of its neighbors and , at the same time , network coordination is achieved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : math_prel ] by introducing the notation and mathematical preliminaries that are useful for the paper , while in section [ sec : probl_stat ] we will formalize the problem statement .",
    "then , in section [ sec : com_sto_syn ] we introduce a sufficient condition to ensure complete stochastic synchronization of a network affected by noise , while in section [ sec : noise_synch ] we turn our attention to network control and provide a result that allows to use noise to achieve synchronization .",
    "the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in both section [ sec : com_sto_syn ] and section [ sec : noise_synch ] where our results are used to analyze / control synchronization in a network of fitzhugh - nagumo oscillators .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : applications ] we also show that the approach proposed in this paper can be applied to study a collective decision making ( or _ cognitive _ ) processes .",
