    "_ _ the purest and most thoughtful minds are those which love colour the most _ _    one of the reasons that our forbears were drawn to astronomy was the sheer drama and beauty of the night sky .",
    "when photography became a standard astronomical technique , it was natural to combine images taken in different bands to produce spectacular colored images of the night sky ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    when ccd detectors were introduced into astronomy 25 years ago , and especially when large - format cameras became common , astronomers were once again motivated to generate 3-color composites .",
    "ccds are approximately linear , unlike the roughly logarithmic sensitivity curve of photographic plates , so the natural way to produce an image was to map the logarithm of the pixel intensities to the red , green , and blue brightnesses in the final image ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this algorithm produces pictures that look rather like those produced from photographs , but unfortunately it also discards a lot of information .",
    "let us consider ccd data taken in three bands which we shall call @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( e.g. @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) ; we assume that these data have been background - subtracted , if necessary linearised , flatfielded , and scaled appropriately .",
    "this scaling is to some extent arbitrary , as different astronomers prefer different color balances , but we have found that a conversion to @xmath9 ( in practice to an ab scale , @xcite ) works well .",
    "we desire a mapping to the range @xmath10 $ ] for each of three colors red ( r ) , green ( g ) , and blue ( b ) .",
    "the usual algorithm is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the minimum value to display , and @xmath14 the maximum ; these are chosen to bring out favoured details .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a common choice is logarithmic ( @xmath15 ) , but linear or square - root stretches are also popular .",
    "the actual implementation , at least for integer input data , often uses a lookup table .",
    "this style of mapping simulates one of the unfortunate features of photographic plates , namely that all pixels for which @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 are @xmath16 appear white in the final image . in a photograph",
    "this white color corresponds to a lack of information , but for a ccd it is a choice made by the astronomer .",
    "in fact , for _ any _ non - linear function @xmath17 , an object s color in the composite image depends upon its brightness , even if _ none _ of @xmath5 , @xmath4 , or @xmath3 exceed @xmath14 .",
    "fortunately , we can easily avoid these problems . defining @xmath18 , ,",
    "e.g. a root - mean - square or @xmath19 value . ]",
    "set @xmath20    if @xmath21 , set @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ; if @xmath25 , set @xmath26 . in other words , the intensity is clipped at unity , but the _ color _ is correct . additionally , it is possible to choose a more flexible functional form for @xmath17 ; following @xcite , we take @xmath27 , where the softening parameter @xmath28 is chosen to bring out desired details  it determines the point at which we change from a linear to a logarithmic transformation ( @xmath29 for @xmath30 ; @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) . , which allows the user to first set @xmath33 and choose the linear stretch @xmath34 , and then adjust @xmath35 to bring out brighter features . in this case , @xmath36 . ]",
    "the linear part is used to show faint features in the data , while the logarithmic part enables us to simultaneously illustrate structures such as spiral arms or the cores of star clusters that are significantly brighter . as an additional trick , we find that sometimes a @xmath37 stretch brings out the details of dust lanes in spiral galaxies ; here , as before , the @xmath2 is used to control the dynamic range .",
    "the results of this simple change are dramatic ; a given color ( i.e. value of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) is now mapped to a unique color in the rgb image . fig .",
    "[ figngc6978 ] shows an sdss @xcite g - r - i composite of the galaxies ngc6976 , ngc6977 , and ngc6978 .",
    "the reader will notice that the stars , rather than all being white , show a variety of red , yellow , and bluish tints ; that the spiral bulges ( and the group of ellipticals to the lower right of ngc6977 ) are a uniform yellowish color , while the spiral disks are blue ( @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 appear in b and r respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , it is evident that star formation activity in the disks ( as indicated by the distinctive bluish color ) decreases from left to right .",
    "we may use the well - known color composite of the hubble deep field ( hdf ; @xcite ) , fig .",

    "the top left panel shows the familiar stsci color image .",
    "the bottom left panel use an @xmath2 stretch , and is our preferred representation of the hdf . the top middle panel is our best match to the stsci image and uses a logarithmic stretch ; the middle bottom panel uses the same logarithmic function ( i.e. identical values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the righthand pair of panels share a hard linear stretch ( it is identical to the linear part of the @xmath2 stretch of the bottom left panel ) .",
    "interestingly , the bottom set of panels are pretty similar , with the main difference being that the spiral arms in the lower left corner are rather better defined in the leftmost panel .",
    "it is clear that much of the morphological information is carried in the _ color _ rather than the _",
    "intensity_.    the bands ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) used in fig . [ fighdf ] are not quite the same as those used in the sdss composites ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath45 ) but the astrophysical palette is similar , in the sense that the larger hdf galaxies have colors similar to those seen in fig . [ figngc6978 ] , with blue disks and yellowish bulges . the fainter objects , however , look unlike _ anything _ seen in sdss imaging , with bright red ( k - corrected ) bulges and , in some cases , bluish disks which must be due to active star formation and the emission of far - uv light .",

    "although ccds are wonderful detectors , they are not perfect .",
    "the sdss data processing pipeline @xcite interpolates over saturation trails , which accounts for their absence from these images .",
    "unfortunately , it is not able to correctly recover the counts in the cores of saturated stars , but we _ do _ know which pixels were involved .",
    "[ eqintensitystretch ] means that every pixel in the image preserves its color , even in the saturated cores of stars .",
    "we can avoid undesirable artifacts in the final picture by finding connected pixels which were saturated in at least one band , and replacing them with the average color of the pixels touching the saturated region . because we do not wish to average over the long bleed - trails produced by bright stars",
    ", we only apply this procedure to saturated pixels with intensities @xmath46 .",
    "an obvious example of a bright star is seen at the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ figngc2419 ] ; in this case we treated all pixels with at least 10000 counts in any band as ` saturated ' .",
    "the original implementation of these algorithms was included in the sdss image processing code , but fortunately stand - alone versions are also available .",
    "an idl version is available from ` http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/visualization/rgb/ ` , and a c version from`http://www.sdss.jhu.edu / doc / jpeg.html ` .",
    "color images have traditionally been considered a luxury , but with the techniques espoused in this paper , we have found that they convey an enormous amount of information .",
    "for example , star - forming regions have a distinctive color , and it is very clear , looking at images of spiral galaxies , how much the star formation rate varies .",
