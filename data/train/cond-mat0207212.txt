    "the cytoskeleton of eucaryotic cells is a complex three dimensional network of protein filaments , most prominently actin filaments and microtubules  @xcite .",
    "its elastic and viscous properties are essentially defining the mechanical or material properties of living cells .",
    "this network resembles in many aspects a polymer solution or a gel .",
    "the main difference from usual polymer materials is its intrinsic activity .",
    "in fact , the cytoskeleton is constantly remodeled through the polymerization and depolymerization of filaments , as well as through the formation and breakup of cross - links .",
    "in addition , the cross - links may be active , leading to further dynamics .",
    "active or mobile cross - links are provided for example by molecular motors which are specialized enzymes which transduce the chemical energy of a fuel to motion along filaments  @xcite .",
    "all these activities are regulated by the cell which is thus able to direct intracellular transport , to separate its chromosomes and to cleave during cell division , to exert forces on the environment , or to move on a substrate .",
    "the study of active polymer systems requires completely new tools and techniques as compared to the well developed analysis of equilibrium properties , that relies on powerful concepts of equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "indeed , such systems are intrinsically far from equilibrium , and the dynamics at equilibrium , that is usually studied in polymer physics  @xcite , is not sufficient for the description of active systems @xcite . on the contrary , experimental studies of the cytoskeleton under simplified conditions have revealed its ability to self - organize .",
    "namely , the contraction of filament bundles  @xcite , the formation of asters and vortices  @xcite , as well as the formation of networks  @xcite were found in vitro .",
    "using a cell extract , even the formation of bipolar spindles without microtubule organizing centers has been seen  @xcite .",
    "cell fragments containing only the actin cytoskeleton , but neither the nucleus nor microtubules , can propagate on a substrate  @xcite , where the locomoting state coexists with a stationary spherically symmetric state  @xcite . in a mixture of actin filaments and myosin molecular motors ,",
    "active reptation in a polymer solution has been observed  @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention , that experiments probing mechanical properties of living cells have revealed active responses of the cytoskeleton to external forces , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first steps towards a theoretical understanding of active polymer systems have mostly aimed at describing pattern - formation . in one - dimensional filament bundles ,",
    "polarity sorting  @xcite , contraction  @xcite , and propagating waves  @xcite have been observed .",
    "self - organization has also been seen to induce bending waves and complex motion in axonemes  @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the effects of active cross - links on the formation of orientation patterns in systems of spatially fixed filaments have been studied  @xcite and the generation of filament currents by active cross - links has been discussed  @xcite . furthermore , the viscoelastic response of solutions of semi - flexible polymers and active centers has been studied  @xcite .",
    "active filament bundles provide very simple examples of active filament networks and can be discussed by a one - dimensional description .",
    "note , however , that in addition to their simplicity , such filament bundles actually occur in animal cells .",
    "they are , for example , part of stress fibers which generate contractile forces , and of the contractile ring in dividing cells  @xcite . in vitro ,",
    "the contraction of actin bundles in the presence of myosin motors has been observed  @xcite .    motivated by the dynamics of the cytoskeleton",
    ", we develop a general framework based on momentum conservation , to describe the physics of bundles of aligned filaments in the presence of active cross - links . since actin filaments and microtubules are polar as they have two structurally different ends , we consider polar filaments .",
    "the cross - links are mobile and considered to be formed by small aggregates of molecular motors of one type .",
    "we discuss simple scenarios in order to study dynamic phenomena and mechanical properties of such systems . a minimal model which has been introduced in earlier publications  @xcite",
    "can be derived in our general framework using approximations and simplifications .",
    "this model already exhibits many of the phenomena that occur in such systems",
    ". however , it neglects changes in the distribution of motors due to the dynamics of the system .",
    "this dynamics of the motor distribution can be taken into account within our general framework .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the mechanical properties of active bundles in the presence and absence of external forces .    the outline of our manuscript is as follows . in section  [ sec : grundlagen ] , we introduce the general description for active filament bundles based on momentum balance . using this formalism we derive dynamic equations for the system . in section  [ sec : model1 ] , we show how the minimal model can be derived from the general equations .",
    "we review its properties and extend previous work towards a discussion of the full bifurcation diagram . in section  [ sec : model2 ] we study the effects of the dynamics of the motor distribution on the filament dynamics .",
    "the active mechanical properties of a filament bundle can be derived systematically in the framework introduced in section  [ sec : grundlagen ] .",
    "we discuss the bundle mechanics in section  [ sec : spannung ] and study tense states balanced by external forces applied at the ends .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of our results in section  [ sec : diskussion ] which relates our theoretical framework to experimental situations .",
    "the appendices contains a detailed analysis of bifurcations in the minimal model as well as the effects of filament adhesion to a substrate .",
    "we introduce a general description for the dynamics of active filament bundles .",
    "the bundle is described in one dimension using density profiles of filaments and motors .",
    "the dynamics of these densities is governed by currents which are generated by interactions between filaments and motors .",
    "dynamic equations can be derived on the basis of momentum balance .",
    "this general procedure can be carried out most conveniently using simplifying assumptions . in particular , we assume a low motor density or low duty ratio of motors such that interactions between filament pairs dominate , a local friction of filaments with the environment and we neglect the possibility of passive cross - linkers .",
    "furthermore , we assume that filament lengths remain fixed , i.e. we neglect polymerization and depolymerization of filaments , and we assume that filaments can not change their orientation .",
    "however , many of the qualitative behaviors displayed by the resulting equations are more general and are also found in purely phenomenological descriptions which are not based on these simplifying assumptions @xcite .",
    "the dynamic equations we discuss here represent a mean field theory of filament bundles where fluctuations do not appear explicitly but give rise to diffusive terms .",
    "the bundle is characterized by the number densities of filaments and of motor complexes projected on the bundle axis , which leads to an effective one - dimensional description . since filament bending and entanglements",
    "can be ignored in the bundle , we describe filaments as rigid rods .",
    "filaments are aligned along the @xmath0-axis and we distinguish the two sub - populations of filaments with their plus - end pointing into the positive and negative @xmath0-direction , respectively .",
    "these populations are described by the densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , such that , e.g. , @xmath3 gives the number of filaments with their plus - end in the positive @xmath0-direction and their center located in the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "we assume , that motors are small compared to the filament length and will be treated as point - like in our description .",
    "the number density of motors is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the filament and motor densities satisfy the conservation laws @xmath6 here , the currents @xmath7 and @xmath8 are generated by the active interaction between motors and filaments .",
    "the densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are conserved separately since we do not allow filaments to change their orientation .",
    "fluctuations in the system give rise to diffusive terms with diffusion coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 of filaments and motors . while the diffusion of motors could be expected to result from thermal fluctuations , the diffusion of filaments is generated effectively by fluctuations of the forces induced by motor - filament interactions . for long filaments ,",
    "the contribution of thermal fluctuations to the diffusion coefficient @xmath9 is negligible .",
    "we return to this point in sect .",
    "[ sec : diskussion ] .      in the absence of external forces",
    ", the total momentum is conserved in the filament bundle .",
    "forces acting within the bundle lead to an exchange of momentum with the environment or between filaments .",
    "since filaments are treated as rigid , extended objects with momentum distributed along the full length of the filament , we introduce the momentum densities @xmath11 .",
    "these densities represent the momentum at position @xmath12 carried by all plus- or minus - filaments , respectively , with their centers located at position @xmath0 .",
    "the momentum balance can then be expressed as    @xmath13    here , momentum flux along filaments centered at @xmath0 is given by the tensions @xmath14 .",
    "momentum exchange between filaments is nonlocal and described by the internal force densities @xmath15 , which include all active filament interactions via motors .",
    "the force densities @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are source and sink terms , describing momentum exchange with the environment .",
    "they result from friction with the fluid ( @xmath19 ) , from motors moving along a single filament ( @xmath20 ) , and from external forces ( @xmath21 ) . here",
    ", @xmath0 refers to filaments with center at position @xmath0 , while @xmath12 denotes a position in space , where a force is acting and momentum is exchanged .",
    "momentum conservation in the absence of external forces requires , that @xmath22 = 0\\quad.\\ ] ] this implies , that any force generated by active cross - links on a filament is balanced by an opposite force acting on other filaments , i.e. , internal forces at a point @xmath12 are balanced when integrated over all filaments .",
    "therefore , total momentum @xmath23 changes according to ( ignoring boundary terms ) :    @xmath24\\ ] ]    inertial terms are negligible in a slowly moving bundle , such that we can set @xmath25 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : imppl ] ) and ( [ eq : impmi ] ) then express a balance of forces .    in the most simple case where friction is local , we can write for the density of friction forces @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is a friction coefficient per unit length and @xmath28 is a function characterizing the distribution of energy dissipation along moving filaments . if all filaments are of the same length @xmath29 , a simple choice is @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 otherwise .",
    "however , the function @xmath28 can also account for situations with a distribution of filament lengths .",
    "then , @xmath28 is related to the probability , that a given filament is longer than @xmath33 .",
    "the forces exerted by motors moving along a single filament are linear in the filament and motor densities , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the friction coefficient corresponding to single motors and the coefficient @xmath36 characterizes the binding to and motion on filaments of individual motors      while the internal forces are balanced at a point @xmath12 when integrated over all filaments , the total force @xmath37 acting on filaments centered at a given position @xmath0 does not vanish in general .",

    "since friction of motors is small as compared to filament friction , @xmath41 , the contribution of @xmath42 can be neglected in most practical cases , in particular , for low motor densities . in the following",
    ", we therefore set @xmath43 .    in order to write explicit expressions for the currents ,",
    "we need a model for the internal forces in the bundle .",
    "we consider the case when clusters of three or more cross - linked filaments form rarely enough , such that their contribution to the internal forces can be neglected .",
    "this holds in the case of a low motor density or for motors with a low duty ratio , which is the fraction of time a motor spends attached to a filament  @xcite .",
    "if interactions between filament pairs dominate , we can split the internal forces into those between filaments of the same and those of opposite orientation .",
    "we write @xmath44 and analogously for @xmath45 .",
    "a motor may link two filaments and thus exert forces of opposite sign on each of them , whenever they overlap . assuming that the probability for two filaments to interact increases quadratically with filament density , we write    @xmath46    and corresponding expressions for @xmath47 . here , @xmath48 is the average force acting on plus - filaments at a distance @xmath49 from the center exerted by motors , that interact with other minus - filaments located at a distance @xmath50 from the first , see fig .",

    ", we expect the main results of our work to apply in certain regimes .",
    "a similar modification of model parameters can be expected in general , if other proteins are present which interact with motors and/or filaments .",
    "for example , the interaction strength @xmath67 between equally oriented filaments could be significantly enhanced by proteins bound to filaments which affect the speed of motors .",
    "in fact , it might seem odd at first glance that filaments of the same orientation exhibit significant interactions via motors at all . as a motor advances on both filaments with the same speed , no relative motion is generated .",
    "interactions between filaments of the same orientation are induced by motors that do not move with the same speed on two cross - linked filaments .",
    "this happens , e.g. , when a motor arrives on one filament at the end towards which it moves . in this case , the motor stops on one filament while continuing for a while to move on the second filament .",
    "this induces relative filament sliding via an end - effect .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath67 between equally oriented filaments can be enhanced if the motor speed varies along the whole filament .",
    "for example , the speed of motors can be affected by the presence of other motors on the same filament .",
    "such crowding would typically lead to a slowing down of motors as they approach the filament end  @xcite , generating relative motion of filament pairs .",
    "furthermore , one could imagine specific proteins bound to the filaments which affect the speed of motors .",
    "if such proteins had a graded distribution linked to the filament polarity , they would lead to strong interaction terms between filaments of the same orientation .",
    "these examples illustrate , that in more complex situations where additional proteins are present , the main results of our work could still apply , however , with effective parameters .",
    "this suggest , that the essential properties of active filament bundles found in our work might be even more general and could also apply to more complex situations found in vivo .",
    "for example , our results could apply to stress fibers .",
    "these are contractile actin bundles in cells lacking the obvious periodic organization of muscles  @xcite but containing myosins and other proteins . as we have demonstrated in sect .",
    "[ sec : spannung ] , the generation of tension and contraction is possible through the interaction of filament pairs without the need of a muscle - like sarcomere structure . the periodic boundary conditions which we use in several examples correspond to the situation , where the bundle forms a ring and could apply for example to contractile rings which cleaves a cell during cell division .",
    "interestingly , the types of dynamic behaviors which we observe also include qualitatively the symmetry breaking presented by fragments of fish keratocytes  @xcite .",
    "these fragments consist of the lamellipodium , which is the flattened leading margin of these cells , responsible for their migration .",
    "notably , they do contain neither the nucleus nor microtubules .",

    "our description of active bundles provides a firm basis for the development of more profound theories of active filament systems , which could help understanding self - organization and dynamic behaviors in living cells such as cell locomotion . moving on into this direction",
