    "the 5th dimension is compactified on a circle of planck length .",
    "similar ideas appear in ( super)string theories , which are only consistent in 10 and 26 dimensions in the case of superstring , respectively bosonic string theory @xcite .",
    "recently , so - called brane world models @xcite have gained a lot of interest .",
    "these assume the standard model fields to be confined on a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional manifold .",
    "a large number of higher dimensional black holes has been studied in recent years .",
    "the first solutions that have been constructed are the hyperspherical generalisations of well - known black holes solutions such as the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions in more than four dimensions @xcite as well as the higher dimensional kerr solutions @xcite . in @xmath1 dimensions , these solutions have horizon topology @xmath2 .",
    "however , in contrast to 4 dimensions black holes with different horizon topologies should be possible in higher dimensions .",
    "an example is a 4-dimensional schwarzschild black hole extended into one extra dimension , a so - called schwarzschild black string .",
    "these solutions have been discussed extensively especially with view to their stability @xcite .",
    "a second example , which is important due to its implications for uniqueness conjectures for black holes in higher dimensions , is the black ring solution in 5 dimensions with horizon topology @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the by far largest number of higher dimensional black hole solutions constructed so far are solutions of the vacuum einstein equations , respectively einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the first example of black hole solutions containing non - abelian gauge fields have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "these are non - abelian black holes solutions of a generalised 5-dimensional einstein - yang - mills system with horizon topology @xmath4 .    here",
    "we construct black hole solutions of an einstein - yang - mills model discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "these solutions are non - abelian black hole solutions in 4 dimensions extended into one extra codimension .",
    "we give the model including the ansatz , equations of motion and boundary conditions in section ii .",
    "the numerical results are discussed in section iii .",
    "the summary is given in section iv .",
    "the einstein - yang - mills lagrangian in @xmath5 dimensions is given by :    @xmath6    with the su(2 ) yang - mills field strengths @xmath7 , the gauge index @xmath8 and the space - time index @xmath9 .",

    "if both the metric and matter fields are independent on the extra coordinate @xmath17 , the fields can be parametrized as follows @xcite : @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 is the @xmath21-dimensional metric tensor .",
    "our aim is to construct non - abelian black holes , which are spherically symmetric in 4 dimensions and are extended into one extra dimension .",
    "the topology of these non - abelian black strings will thus be @xmath22 .",

    "finiteness of the energy and asymptotic flatness requires : @xmath49",
    "the set of equations has been solved numerically @xcite .",
    "these black hole solutions can be interpreted as 4-dimensional black holes sitting in the center of particle - like solutions extended into one extra dimension . due to the non - triviality of the matter fields outside the regular horizon , these solutions possess `` hair '' .",
    "first , @xmath50 was fixed and the dependence of the solutions on the gravitational coupling @xmath51 was studied .",
    "the results are shown for @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the behaviour for fixed @xmath50 is very similar to that of the globally regular solutions @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 was increased from small values and the solutions exist up to a maximal value of the gravitational coupling , @xmath53 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "we find that @xmath54 . on this branch of solutions , the dimensionless mass @xmath55 per unit length of the extra dimension decreases ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , both the value of @xmath56 as well as the minimal value of the metric function @xmath57 in the interval @xmath58x_h:\\infty]$ ] , @xmath59 , decrease from the flat space values @xmath60 , respectively @xmath61 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , while the value of @xmath62 increases from @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "starting from the maximal value @xmath64 , a second branch of solutions exists up to a critical value of @xmath51 , @xmath65 .",
    "on this second branch @xmath56 and @xmath59 decrease further , while @xmath62 now decreases , crosses zero and then becomes negative . the mass per unit length on this branch is higher than that on the first branch of solutions , see fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "starting from this second branch of solutions , a third branch of solutions exists and extends to @xmath66 . on this third branch",
    ", @xmath56 decreases further to @xmath67 zero , while @xmath62 tends to @xmath68 .",
    "however , @xmath59 stays finite .",
    "the mass on this third branch is lower than that on the second , put differs so marginally that it can not be seen in the plot .    as is clearly see , the extend of the branches in @xmath51 decreases , which is very similar to the globally regular case .",
    "it is likely that an infinite number of branches exists which extend around @xmath69 .",
    "note that on the third branch of solutions , the function @xmath70 starts to develop oscillations . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the matter and metric functions close to the horizon @xmath52 are shown for the solutions on the third branch for @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath57 has developped a local minimum . clearly , the solution is non - trivial outside the regular horizon and thus represents a non - abelian black string .",
    "the oscillations of the function @xmath70 indicate that -like in the globally regular case- the solutions converge to the fixed point described in @xcite .",
    "the fact that the solutions exist only up to a maximal value of the gravitational coupling was already observed in other gravitating systems containing non - abelian gauge fields , e.g. in the 4-dimensional einstein - yang - mills - higgs system @xcite .",
    "the first branch of solutions can be interpreted as a branch on which the variation of @xmath72 corresponds to the variation of the gravitational coupling @xmath73 , while @xmath29 is kept fixed .",
    "this can be concluded from the fact that the @xmath74 limit corresponds to the flat limit @xmath75 .",
    "in contrast , on the further branches @xmath73 is kept fixed and @xmath29 varied .",
    "since @xmath76 would correspond effectively to a 4-dimensional einstein - yang - mills - dilaton system , which has bartnik - mckinnon - type solutions @xcite with zeros of the gauge field functions and thus different boundary conditions , the @xmath74 limit does nt exist for these additional branches .",
    "the existence of a maximal value of @xmath51 is thus related to the existence of a maximal possible value of the gravitational coupling @xmath73 .    in fig.[fig4 ] , the domain of existence of the non - abelian black strings is shown .",
    "the maximal possible value @xmath64 of the globally regular solutions is @xmath77 @xcite . from this value",
    "@xmath53 decreases with increasing @xmath50 and finally reaches @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "non - abelian black strings thus exist only in a limited domain of the @xmath50-@xmath51-plane .",
    "black holes in more than 4 dimensions have gained renewed interest in recent years due to theories of unification of all known forces . since these theories assume that the extra dimensions are compactified on a circle of the planck length , black hole solutions which are hyperspherically symmetric in the full dimensions are important at early stages in the universe . a large number of these solutions has been constructed and extensively discussed . for smaller energies , i.e. later stages in the evolution of the universe , black hole solutions which are spherically symmetric in 4 dimensions and extended trivially or non - trivially into the extra dimensions are certainly of more interest . here",
    ", we have constructed the first example of a 5-dimensional black string including non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "these solutions are spherically symmetric black holes sitting in the center of particle - like solutions in 4 dimensions , which are trivially extended into a fifth dimension .",
    "we have shown that these solutions exist only in a limited domain in the @xmath50-@xmath51-plane and that several branches of solutions ( likely infinitely many ) exist . in the limit of critical coupling",
    "these solutions converge -like the globally regular ones- to the fixed point described in @xcite .",
    "as far as the stability of these solutions is concerned , a detailed analysis is certainly out of the scope of this paper .",
    "however , from morse theory , we can assume that the second branch has one unstable mode more than the first ( since it has higher energy ) and one less than the third etc .",
    "since for @xmath74 , the globally regular counterparts of the solutions here are effectively the solutions of a 4-dimensional yang - mills - higgs system in the bps limit ( which are known to be stable ) it is likely that the globally regular counterparts on the first branch of solutions are stable , while they have @xmath80 unstable modes on the @xmath81th branch . furthermore , since for the 4-dimensional einstein - yang - mills model the number of unstable modes is equal for the globally regular and the non - abelian black hole solutions @xcite , we expect the same to be true in the 5-dimensional analogue .",
    "this leads us to the assumption that the non - abelian black strings are stable on the first branch and unstable ( with @xmath80 unstable modes on the @xmath81th branch ) on the other branches",
    ". surely , this point has to be investigated in detail .    further directions of investigation of the model studied here are the construction of 4-dimensional axially symmetric non - abelian black holes extended into one extra dimension or the non - trivial extension of these solutions into the extra dimension , i.e. the construction of non - uniform , non - abelian black strings",
