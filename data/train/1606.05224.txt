    "this data has been used to show that mars once possessed an atmosphere and environmental conditions substantially more favorable to life . while large scale flow features had been discovered by the viking spacecraft@xcite , science performed _ in situ _ by the mars exploration rovers ( spirit and opportunity ) and the mars science laboratory ( curiosity )",
    "have made a convincing case that mars once had sustained periods of surface water flow@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , orbiting satellites such as mars global surveyor and mars reconaissance orbiter have provided us with high resolution imagery and topographic data .",

    "all other investigations of global scale exohydrology are similarly speculative , because the necessary data only exists for the earth ( which already has rivers ) , the moon ( which will never have rivers ) and mars ( which once had rivers of some sort ) .",
    "mars is thus the only case where such literary speculation can now be approached with some degree of rigor .    while the terraforming of mars is one or possibly two steps beyond nasa s existing plans for mars exploration , the sun has gotten a lot warmer since the collapse of mars greenhouse effect billions of years ago@xcite .",
    "more recently , humans have developed the sort of integrated heavy industry without which crewed space exploration was previously , and may yet be again , impossible .",
    "in other words , now is the best and perhaps the only time to warm the planet back up and once again run rivers on its surface",
    ".    this research attempts to evaluate what proportion of , and at what scales , mars surface is hydrologically disordered or merely deranged@xcite . on earth",
    "there are a handful of deserts where geotectonic ( or volcanic ) orogenic processes are more rapid than water or wind erosion , leading to deranged drainage and fractal endorheic basins .",
    "if this were generally the case on mars , a reactivated hydrological cycle would have to cut new watercourses before it ( literally ) ran out of steam .",
    "in one particularly grim scenario , a brief warm / wet period results in mass migration of water to high altitude glaciers . in this case , planetary albedo increases and crashes the climate , and what little water mars has is lost via sublimation and rapid solar atmospheric stripping .",
    "martian paleohydrology has been studied intensively since viking data first revealed massive flow outburst channels@xcite .",
    "these ( possibly ice - covered ) flows , derived from destabilized aquifers rather than meteoric precipitation , carved deep channels into the bedrock and fed a putative northern ocean@xcite . smaller scale integrated valley networks link regions of intermittent glaciation and lower level drainage@xcite , according to the cold / wet ancient climate models@xcite .",
    "this paper is a novel quantitative attempt to predict global hydrology for a terraformed planet . here",
    ", we describe the algorithm used to predict water flow , present an example data set , compare it to high resolution topographic data , and then examine the potential future of watercourses on mars .",
    "while commercial software packages are available to simulate terrestrial watersheds for , e.g. , agricultural runoff or stormwater drain system design@xcite , in this section we outline our extensible model algorithm for simple surface runoff and precipitation , to illustrate how surface water flow can be handled computationally .",
    "considering a 1d discretized test case , the change in water level at any particular point is due to flow from adjacent points to that point , which is in turn dependent on the relative heights of water at each point .",
    "a back of the envelope calculation shows that water flow is governed by a parabolic equation ( @xmath1 ) , wherein local variations diffuse outwards through the surrounding area .    in more detail , given a water level height @xmath2 at time @xmath3 and position @xmath4 ,",
    "its change over time is governed by how much water flows to or away from that point from immediately adjacent points .",
    "this can be expressed : @xmath5 or @xmath6 from which the continuous case is trivially derived .",
    "the diffusion equation , however , is inappropriate for solving this problem as it does not impose a positive constraint on water depth ; as a result , the depth parameter can become unphysically negative .    the approach we used to overcome this limitation is the imposition , between successive applications of the finite forward difference , of an intersticial normalization step to ensure that at no point would the depth parameter drop below zero .",
    "since we intend to use this algorithm to predict erosion rates of the entire primeval martian surface , we include it here for a more thorough exposition of a few of its subtleties .",
    "in particular , more sophisticated algorithms leverage primarily well - ordered catchments , an assumption explicitly excluded within the framework of this study .    below , the algorithm is presented in a pointwise frame of reference , although in practice an array - oriented implementation is more efficient .",
    "our reference implementation was written in _",
    "mathematica _ and can be downloaded at @xcite .    1",
    ".   initialize datasets @xmath7 for topographic data and @xmath8 for water depth .",
    "we used a greyscale mola image ( no relief shading ) with a resolution of 720@xmath91440 , or 0.25@xmath10 , to derive @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 was initialized at 147 m everywhere , although the algorithm can use any initial value .",
    "as well as being close to upper estimates of total reserves of water remaining on mars ( isotope analysis indicates perhaps 85% of water has escaped since the noachian@xcite ) , 147 m is also equivalent to 0.5% of the total planetary topographic relief of 29429 m . 2 .",
    "extend the domain using ghost zones to ensure continuity in periodic domains and consistant array sizes .",
    "3 .   obtain the ( negative ) forward difference as a proxy for the induced flow in the positive direction .",
    "@xmath11 4 .",
    "split @xmath12 into positive @xmath13 and negative @xmath14 parts , and assign each flow condition to the cell _ from _ which the water will flow .",
    "multiply by a notional step size @xmath3 to determine the total depth of water that will be subtracted from each cell in the subsequent step in each direction @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 5 .",
    "reduce @xmath15 if necessary to ensure the total water lost is less than depth .",

    "reallocate water accordingly .",

    "apply algorithm alternately in each direction , updating the depth each time .",
    "we used the explicit euler method , which is stable under the usual conditions .    as applied this method",
    "will quickly converge to a series of puddles , lakes , seas , and oceans , with steadily decreasing flow between them as the algorithm flattens their respective surfaces and shunts the difference over the lip .    to ensure continuous recharge",
    ", we added a precipitation function to each time step .",
    "a constant quantity of depth was subtracted from every suffiently deep body of water and then redistributed with a proportionality that varied with the underlying altitude , mimicking the rain - making properties of mountains due to adiabatic cooling under orographic lifting@xcite .",
    "the model does not include any atmospheric effects such as prevailing wind , rain shadowing , or seasonal variation which , by adding complexity without contributing additional insight to the central question of emergent watershed formation , are beyond the scope of this study .",
    "the primary concern of this work was not to create in any sense an accurate climate - driven hydrological model , but to determine whether , if precipitation occurred on the potentially poorly drained and high altitude southern hemisphere , water would pool and gradually redistribute itself to a higher average altitude . in this case , one might expect glaciation , a raised albedo , and counterproductive terraforming effects , not to mention a general slowing destabilization of the hydrological cycle .",
    "the precipitation algorithm has one parameter , namely the quantity of evaporation @xmath20 per time step .",
    "@xmath20 is best interpreted in comparison with the rate of water flow over the surface , or the chance that any given water molecule has of making it to the ocean versus evaporating on the way .",
    "systems with a relatively large @xmath20 have behaviour like the antarctic dry valleys@xcite , where water tends to be redistributed upwards until all the mountains are buried under water ( or ice ) and the valleys and sinks are relatively dry .",
    "conversely , systems with a low value of @xmath20 represent rapid motion of water across the ground relative to evaporation and lead to the formation of large , integrated drainage systems and much drier mountain peaks , such as the american southwest@xcite .",
    "1.0        0.45   [ fig : moladatakey ]       0.45   [ fig : depthkey ]    1.0     here , i present a sample converged set of results , shown in figures  [ fig : results1 ] and  [ fig : results2 ] .",
    "initial depth was 147 m , evaporation was a factor @xmath21 smaller than this , or about 1.5 mm , per time step . a rectangular equi - angular projection of altitude data , shown in figure  [ fig : moladata ] , was used",
    ". converged depth is shown in figure  [ fig : depth ] , consisting of flooded impact craters of various sizes , some of the more prominent channels feeding chryse planitia@xcite , and a large , shallow northern ocean , with substantial exposed ` sea bed ' compared to the putative ancient oceans .",
    "the location of these , and other regions , are labelled in figure  [ fig : marsmap ] .",
    "it is important to note that geoid / areoid changes@xcite , true polar wander@xcite , crustal subsidence and uplift@xcite , and post - hesperian volcanism@xcite have altered the ancient water courses , in some places substantially .",
    "one particularly salient example is the basalt flow - modified western edge of the echus chaos .",
    "these changes underscore the risk of assuming that ancient watercourses will automatically resume their function without performing a surface runoff calculation .",
    "1.0        0.65   [ fig : gradandflowkey ]       0.25   [ fig : flowdirectionskey ]    1.0     in analysing the data , we have used both hue and brightness to convey a sample of what this dataset can describe . surface water flow volume , or flux , is shown with brightness .",
    "brighter areas represent regions of concentrated and rapid surface flow , or gradual flow in deep bodies of water .",
    "colour is used in figure  [ fig : gradandflow ] to encode the relative gradient of the underlying topography , showing waterfalls , rapids , and regions of relatively fast incision in bright red .",
    "if drainage channels incise headwards rapidly enough , they may be able to capture and drain high altitude lakes before they freeze or sequester all available water . in the next section ,",
    "we analyse one particular case study in detail .    in figure",
    "[ fig : flowdirections ] , we use hue instead to encode flow direction .",
    "this is useful for determining the ultimate path of watercourses , and the demarcation of watersheds .",
    "olympus mons , whose location is shown in figure  [ fig : marsmapbig ] , has a particularly nice radial flow pattern .",
    "one interesting case is the ponderous course taken by water on the eastern rim of noctis labyrinthus , which flows east across syria planum , solis planum , melas fossae , to nirgal vallis , before heading northeast to join ares vallis draining into chryse , with locations shown in figure  [ fig : marsmapvallis ] .",
    "0.48        0.48     in figure  [ fig : poleflux ] , i show flow strength and direction at the north and south pole , highlighting the network of relatively poorly drained basins at the south pole .",
    "nevertheless , they mostly appear to have natural drainage in some stage of development .    in summary , these data show that , contrary to some expectations , the re - activated martian hydrosphere has catchments that are mostly not deranged .",
    "figure  [ fig : gradandflow ] shows that channelized flow would incise and drain lakes , with mars enhanced vertical relief compensating for its commensurately reduced surface gravity . with sufficient mountainous precipitation",
    ", several large river networks would form along the surface .",
    "figure  [ fig : flowdirections ] shows the division of the surface into three primary watersheds focused on argyre , hellas , and the northern basin .",
    "a relative handful of isolated craters ( e.g. darwin , discussed below ) have their own small endorheic drainage systems , but under our precipitation model never overcome evaporation to fill even partially , due to their relatively tiny catchment areas .",
    "finally , a small region around the south pole , extensively modified by the polar ice cap and poorly resolved by mola , has indeterminate drainage , as shown in figure  [ fig : southpoleflux ] .",
    "0.45        0.49     figure  [ fig : gradandflow ] shows areas in bright red where large volumes of water combined with steep underlying topography indicate candidate areas for rapid stream incision and notch regression . in particular , the drainage pattern on the southeast rim of argyre planitia features a steep valley joining a shallow highland lake with the drowned crater floor , shown in figure  [ fig : validation ] .",
    "when compared to much ( 32@xmath9 ) higher resolution mola data , this flow has resulted in the ancient incision of an actual physical valley ( dzigai vallis , oceanidum fossa ) on mars .",
    "this valley s notch indicates recession to the floor of the highland lake ( doanus vallis ) , indicating that sufficient water ( by precipitation or aquifer outburst ) flowed to cut this previously endorheic region completely , facilitating its drainage .",
    "these locations are labelled in figure  [ fig : marsmapargyre ] . the valley appears to have regressed towards the edge of another endorheic basin , between craters sahr and wegener . here , the drainage splinters as it crosses the hellas - argyre watershed , as shown in figure  [ fig : southpoleflux ] .    interestingly ,",
    "some craters coopt nearby flows and fill with water ( and sediment ) , while others ( darwin , maraldi , galle , green ) , ringed completely by high walls and with limited catchment , remain relatively dry .",
    "this demonstrates that , contrary to initial expectations , much of the martian southern hemisphere has had sufficient erosion by ancient water flows to be well drained .",
    "comparison of several other predicted flow regions with the relevant mola data shows , in particular , an integrated drainage system flowing from the mountain peaks northwest of hellas to the shore of the putative northern ocean , a straight line distance of around 4000 km with a fall of around 6 km , equivalent to some of the longest rivers on earth@xcite .",
    "these results show that low resolution predictions of drainage and flow patterns are largely supported by high resolution images and altimetry data , which show that ancient flows have already carved drainage channels into the walls and floors of transitory paleolakes .",
    "additionally , global drainage patterns show that , contrary to our initial expectation , most of the martian surface is well drained .",
    "this means that a revived hydrological cycle could function with little to no modification of existing landforms by , e.g. , dams , blasting of channels , or melting of crater walls with orbital mirrors .    while it is clear that drainage systems on mars after the late heavy bombardment were insufficiently long - lived to significantly degrade the craters of the southern highlands , this exploratory study gives some measure of confidence that , in the event of a revived martian hydrological cycle , most liberated liquid water would not be absorbed by endorheic high altitude lakes . in other words , despite appearances , much of the region has established , if subtle , drainage patterns",
    "this study gives a first estimate of how mars current estimated water supply could recreate a hydrological cycle , though it is possible additional water sources exist , such as recharged subsurface aquifers@xcite .",
    "while this study addresses fundamental questions about emergent watersheds during terraforming of another planet , it also raises further questions that could be addressed in future work .",
    "some of these include :    * locating regions of maximal future erosion , by leveraging the entire mola dataset for a high resolution study that would use existing canyons not resolved in this study . *",
    "estimating relative and absolute flow rates of new rivers , by implementing a more sophisticated climate model that could take into account solar heating , prevailing wind , rain shadowing , and perhaps seasonal variations .",
    "this would provide quantitative estimates of relative flow rates in different catchments , as well as more precisely predicting relative levels of the northern ocean , and hellas and argyre seas , under a range of hypothesized climate and water availability estimates .",
    "* predicting future evolution of catchments by simulating erosion of high volume , high relief flows to estimate basin drainage and stream capture . include glaciation and glacial erosion to more accurately estimate sediment flows and downstream deposition .",
    "our initial assumptions about drainage patterns ( or lack thereof ) in the relatively primal and highly cratered southern terrain were found to be partly unfounded . in particular ,",
    "multiple predicted sites of rapid erosion and canyon incision were found to already exhibit these features , indicating that large regions of the southern hemisphere _ already _ have drainage systems . while not obvious from a distance , a potential revived hydrological cycle would be less prone to mass uphill water migration and subsequent stability problems than first supposed . consequently , lower altitude lakes and seas would have a greater share of the water , ensuring that the terraformed martian riviera has enough waterfront for everyone .",

    "<S> under a terraforming scenario , a reactivated hydrological cycle on mars will result in upwards movement of water due to evaporation and precipitation . </S>",
    "<S> if mars embryonic fossilized catchments provide inadequate drainage , mars limited supplies of water may be absorbed entirely by crater lakes and glaciers , with negative consequences for the terraforming effort . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a stable , convergent algorithm for the efficient modeling of water flow over disordered terrain . </S>",
    "<S> this model is applied to mars orbital laser altimeter data and successfully predicts the formation of fossilized waterways and canyons visible only at much higher resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this exploratory study suggests that despite its impossibly rugged appearance , ancient water flows have carved channels that provide effective drainage over the majority of mars surface . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide one possible reconstruction of a terraformed surface water distribution . </S>"
