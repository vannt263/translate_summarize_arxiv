    "the atomic imaging system is shown in figure [ fig : imgsyss ] ( see also supplementary section i ) .",
    "we confine a single @xmath3yb@xmath4 ion in vacuum using a linear paul trap @xcite with 3d harmonic oscillation frequencies @xmath6 mhz .",
    "laser light at a wavelength of @xmath7 nm is incident on the ion and resonantly excites the @xmath8 cycling transition ( radiative linewidth @xmath9 mhz ) as shown in fig .",
    "the ion is laser - cooled and localized in each of the three dimensions of position to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 5 nm is the zero - point spread , @xmath12 is the mean thermal vibrational occupation number along each of the dimensions of motion , and @xmath13 is the atomic mass @xcite . for doppler laser cooling with the cooling laser at an oblique angle to all directions of motion , @xmath14 , thus @xmath15 nm @xmath16 and the trapped ion acts as an excellent approximation to a point source .",
    "the isotropic fluorescence from the atom at @xmath7 nm is transmitted through a vacuum viewport and collected by an objective lens of numerical aperture @xmath17 with 10x magnification @xcite ( figure [ fig : imgsyss]b ) .",
    "the intermediate image passes through a pinhole that spatially filters light from background sources .",
    "additional magnification is provided by a second stage lens that forms an image at the face of an electron - multiplying - charge - coupled - device ( emccd ) camera ( figure [ fig : imgsyss]c ) .",
    "the objective lens is mounted on a precision 5-axis alignment stage to compensate for comatic aberrations , and cylindrical optics are inserted after the magnifier lens to compensate for astigmatic aberrations .",
    "the measured spatial distribution of the image is the point spread function ( psf ) @xcite which contains information about the ultimate resolution achievable in an imaging system and is the building block for more complex image formation through deconvolution techniques .",
    "the psf can be decomposed into zernike polynomials @xmath18 ( see methods ) in space@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fourier transform operator , @xmath21 is the wavenumber  and the @xmath22 coefficients are contributions of each zernike component defined in the polar coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath22 coefficients correspond to particular optical aberrations , so detailed characterization of the imaging system follows from the retrieval of the sign and magnitude of these coefficients .",
    "decomposing an image into zernike polynomials relies on numerical algorithms @xcite or semi - analytical calculations @xcite .",
    "here we obtain a full aberration characterization by using a least - squares fit to the measured data , using the @xmath22 coefficients and the exit pupil radius as fitting parameters .",
    "this represents a more general method for aberration retrieval since vector ( polarization ) effects for higher numerical apertures can be neglected @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fit1 ] shows six single - shot images of a single @xmath3yb@xmath25 ion",
    ". figures [ fig : fit1]a - c were taken during alignment and figs .",
    "[ fig : fit1]d - f were taken at different distances from the focal plane of the optimally aligned system .",
    "the images were integrated for @xmath26 s and fitted according to eq . 1 to a linear superposition of the first twelve zernike polynomial basis functions . the overall fitting function",
    "is then smoothed by convolving with a gaussian function that best fits the data and accounts for spatial drifts over long exposures .",
    "we find that the optimal image ( fig .",
    "2f ) has a characteristic radius of @xmath27 nm , consistent with the diffraction - limited airy radius of @xmath28 = 0.61@xmath29/na = 375.1 nm given the system numerical aperture .",
    "based on the one - to - one mapping of the zernike polynomials to optical aberrations , we plot an aberration budget which shows the leading order aberration contributions to each of the images .",
    "for example , the contribution of the dominating negative ( positive ) defocus term of fig .",
    "[ fig : fit1]d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit1]e ) shows that we can map axial displacement on a transverse image distribution , with the position of best focus shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit1]f",
    ". moreover , a contribution of the comatic aberration indicates angular tilt errors and non - zero values of astigmatism indicate anisotropic foci in the system , seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fit1]a - c .",
    "this scheme provides a full quantitative basis for analyzing systems that rely on the aberrations introduced by the particle motion with respect to the objective to extract information on their dynamics .",
    "examples of these experiments involve 3d off - focus tracking @xcite and imaging of atoms arranged in 3d lattices @xcite .",
    "although we describe an atomic emitter , this method can also be applied to the imaging of microbiological test samples ( see supplementary material section iii for an example ) .",
    "the precision of measuring atomic position is dependent on the imaging system light collection and quality . as a result of the optical aberration characterization , even if it is not possible to directly correct the aberrations in the imaging system by alignment , it is feasible to post process and actively feed - forward the aberrated image and obtain a diffraction - limited performance through a digital filter with the phase information of the zernike expansion . in this experiment",
    "we correct the aberrations by direct alignment ( see supplementary information section i ) .",
    "we measure the sensitivity on the position by taking @xmath30 images at 1 ms exposure time , binning them over total time duration intervals @xmath31 and calculating the allan variance of the central position @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 where m is the number of samples per bin and @xmath33 is the centroid of the ion image integrated over time @xmath31 .",
    "each image was integrated along one direction and fit to a one dimensional gaussian linear count density function .",
    "the same procedure taken at different times @xmath31 leads to a curve of position uncertainty @xmath34 vs integration time as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allen ] .",
    "the data is corrected for a dead time of 5 ms between each 1 ms frame , allowing for state preparation and laser cooling ( see methods and @xcite ) .",
    "the shot - noise - limited position sensitivity is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the maximum ( saturated ) measured fluorescence count rate from the atom , @xmath37 is the solid angle fraction of fluorescence collected , and @xmath38 is the quantum efficiency of the camera .",
    "the observed sensitivity of @xmath39nm@xmath5 at small integration times is somewhat higher than the expected level of shot noise ( shown as the blue line in fig .",
    "3 ) , and is consistent with observed super - poissonian noise on the camera . finite pixel size and background counts have negligible impact on the measured position sensitivity .",
    "we measure a minimum uncertainty of @xmath40 nm at an integration time of @xmath41 s. for longer integration times , drifts in the relative position between the optical objective and the trapped ion degrade the position uncertainty as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allen ] , and with simple mechanical improvements in the imaging setup the resolution can likely be pushed well below 1 nm .    given this uncertainty in the position of the harmonically - bound ion , the sensitivity to detecting external forces is @xmath42 . for a single @xmath3yb@xmath4 ion with @xmath43 khz",
    ", this would correspond to a force sensitivity in the yoctonewton ( @xmath44 n ) scale , or an electric field at the @xmath45v / cm scale .",
    "unlike earlier work @xcite , this imaging force sensor applies to single ions and does not require resolution of optical sidebands .",
    "confinement of atomic ions in a paul trap is achieved through oscillating rf electric field gradients that create a harmonic ponderomotive potential @xcite . in the presence of a static uniform electric field",
    "@xmath46 , the ion acquires a  micromotion \" modulation in position @xmath47 to first order in the pseudopotential approximation @xcite , where @xmath48 is the drive frequency of the rf trapping field and @xmath49 is the micromotion amplitude .",
    "the conventional approach for sensing micromotion is based on the first order doppler modulation in the scattering of light from a laser beam of wavenumber @xmath50 propagating along the micromotion velocity @xcite ( see fig [ fig : pmt]a ) .",
    "the correlation between the photon arrival times and the micromotion velocity is measured with a time - to - digital converter . with the excitation laser red - detuned from resonance of order @xmath51 and for small levels of micromotion @xmath52",
    ", the measured fluorescence signal takes the form @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 are dimensionless constants that depend on the precise detuning and intensity of the excitation laser @xcite .    in order to also sense a direct position sensitivity to motion",
    ", we spatially mask the ion image with a sharp edge aperture , normal to the @xmath55 direction of motion . the mask position can be adjusted from , effectively , @xmath56 ( completely exposed ) to @xmath57 ( completely masked ) with @xmath58 covering exactly half of the image .",
    "the total fluorescence behind the mask is then the integrated fluorescence behind the exposed area , @xmath59 where we assume a gaussian image distribution in space with root - mean - square radius @xmath60 and the scale of the mask position @xmath61 is referred to the object .",

    "[ eq : four ] by performing sine and cosine transforms of the data .",
    "the phases of the modulated signal are calibrated by opening the aperture @xmath64 and taking the modulation as proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "figure [ fig : pmt]b shows the position ( @xmath66 ) and velocity ( @xmath65 ) quadrature amplitudes ( normalized to the amplitude at @xmath56 ) as the mask position is scanned . based on the observed velocity - induced modulation in the count rate with full exposure ( @xmath67 )",
    ", we infer a micromotion amplitude of @xmath68 20 nm . as the mask",
    "is scanned along @xmath69 , a position - dependent modulation in the fluorescence rate arises , reaching a maximum level at @xmath58 .",
    "the absolute level of this position - dependent modulation is observed to be 15 times smaller than expected from eq .",
    "[ eq : four ]",
    ". this may be due to slow drifts in the relative position of the ion with respect to the mask : a fluctuation of just 30 nm over the 300 s integration time required to obtain sufficient signal / noise ratio in the measurement would explain the observed reduction in the modulation .",
