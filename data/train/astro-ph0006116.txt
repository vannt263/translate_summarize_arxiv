    "in fact , all well - explored lenses with time delays currently have unpleasantly large degeneracies between the hubble constant and the structure of the lensing potential .",
    "most of the problem is created by the aliasing between the moments of the mass distribution we need to measure ( primarily the monopole ) and higher order moments ( quadrupole , octopole , @xmath5 ) when we have constraints at only two or four positions .",
    "progress requires additional model constraints spread over a wider range of angles and distances relative to the lens center .",
    "many gravitational lenses produced by galaxies now contain multiple images of extended sources .",

    "2 we briefly review the theory of gravitational lensing and then develop a theory of einstein rings in  3 .",
    "we apply the models to the three lenses in  4 and summarize our results in  5 .",
    "in  2.1 we present a summary of the basic theory of lenses as reviewed in more detail by schneider , ehlers & falco ( 1992 ) . in  2.2 we review the basic procedures for fitting lenses composed of multiply - imaged point sources and define the lens models we will use .      we have a source located at @xmath6 in the source plane , which is lensed in a thin foreground screen by the two - dimensional potential @xmath7 .",
    "the images of the source are located at solutions of the lens equation @xmath8 which will have 1 , 2 or 4 solutions for standard lens models . in the multiple image solutions ,",
    "one additional image is invisible and trapped in the singular core of the galaxy .",
    "if the source is extended , the images are tangentially stretched into arcs around the center of the lens , merging into an einstein ring if the source is large enough .",
    "the local distortion of an image is determined by the inverse magnification tensor @xmath9 whose determinant , @xmath10 , sets the relative flux ratios of unresolved images .",
    "surface brightness is conserved by lensing , so a source with surface brightness @xmath11 produces an image with surface brightness @xmath12 where the source and lens coordinates are related by eqn .",
    ". real data has finite resolution due to the psf @xmath13 , so the observed image is the convolution @xmath14 rather than the true surface brightness @xmath15 .",
    "the observed image can be further modified by extinction in the optical / infrared and faraday rotation for polarization measurements in the radio .",
    "the procedures for modeling lenses consisting of unresolved point sources are simple to describe and relatively easy to implement . given a set of observed image positions @xmath16 , and a lens model predicting image positions @xmath17 , the goodness of fit is measured with a @xmath18 statistic @xmath19 with ( in this case ) isotropic positional uncertainties @xmath20 for each image .",
    "the statistic is minimized with respect to the unobserved source position , @xmath6 , and the parameters of the lens model , where the model parameters may be further constrained by the observed properties of the lens ( position , shape , orientation @xmath5 ) .",
    "the relative image magnifications are also constrained by the relative fluxes , but the uncertainties are dominated by systematic errors in the fluxes due to extinction , temporal variations , microlensing and substructure rather than measurement uncertainties . if the images have signed fluxes @xmath21 and the source has flux @xmath22 , then we model the fluxes with another simple @xmath18 statistic @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the magnification at the position of the image and @xmath20 is the uncertainty in the flux @xmath21 .",
    "we fit the lenses discussed in  4 using models based on the softened isothermal ellipsoid , whose surface density in units of the critical surface density is @xmath25 for core radius @xmath26 , ellipsoidal coordinate @xmath27 , and axis ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the model parameters are the critical radius @xmath29 , the core radius @xmath26 , the ellipticity @xmath30 and the position angle , @xmath31 , of the major axis ( see kassiola & kovner 1993 , kormann , schneider & bartelmann 1994 , keeton & kochanek 1998 ) .",
    "we use either the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) , @xmath32 , in which the core radius @xmath33 , or the pseudo - jaffe model , @xmath34 , which truncates the mass distribution of the sie at an outer truncation radius @xmath35 ( see keeton & kochanek 1998 ) .",
    "this allows us to explore the effects of truncating the mass distribution on the lens geometry .",
    "we also allow the models to be embedded in an external tidal shear field characterized by amplitude @xmath36 and position angle @xmath37 , where the angle is defined to point in the direction from which an object could generate the shear as a tidal field .",
    "the simplest possible model of a lens has 5 parameters ( lens position , mass , ellipticity , and orientation ) .",
    "realistic models must add an independent external shear ( see keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 ) , and additional parameters ( 2 in most simple model families ) describing the radial mass distribution of the lens galaxy , for a total of 9 or more parameters .",
    "a two - image lens supplies only 5 constraints on these parameters , so the models are woefully underconstrained .",
    "a four - image lens supplies 11 constraints , but the 3 flux - ratio constraints are usually weak constraints because of the wide variety of systematic problems in interpreting the image fluxes ( extinction , time variability , microlensing , local perturbations @xmath5 , see mao & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "much of the problem is due to aliasing , where the quadrupole in particular , but also the higher angular multipoles , can compensate for large changes in the monopole structure given the limited sampling provided by two or four images .",
    "the paucity of constraints leads to the large uncertainties in hubble constant estimates from time delay measurements ( see impey et al .",

    "the solution is to find more constraints .",
    "einstein rings are one of the most striking properties of lenses .",
    "just as they are visually striking , we can easily measure some of their properties . in  3.1",
    "we discuss the shape of the curve defined by the peak surface brightness of an einstein ring as a function of azimuth . we need a new theory because the curve is a _ pattern _ that can not be modeled using the standard methods for fitting multiply - imaged point sources . in ",
    "3.2 we discuss the locations of the maxima and minima of the brightness of an einstein ring .",
    "finally , in  3.3 we describe the statistic we use to fit einstein rings and its relation to observations .",
    "figure 1 illustrates how an einstein ring is formed , and figures 2 and 3 show the real examples we will consider in  4 .",
    "we visually trace the ring as the curve formed by the peak surface brightness of the ring around the lens galaxy .",
    "we find the curve by locating the peak intensity on radial spokes in the image plane , @xmath38 , which are parameterized by @xmath39 and originate from an arbitrary point @xmath40 near the center of the ring ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "more complicated parameterizations are possible but unnecessary . for each azimuth @xmath41",
    "we determine the position of the maximum , @xmath42 , and the image flux at the maximum .",
    "mathematically , the extrema of the surface brightness of the image @xmath43 along the spoke are the solutions of @xmath44 the next step is to translate the criterion for the ring location into the source plane . for simplicity , we assume that the image is a surface brightness map so that @xmath45 . using the lens equation ( 1 ) and the definition of the magnification tensor ( eqn . ( 2 ) )",
    ", the criterion for the maximum becomes @xmath46 geometrically , we are finding the point where the tangent vector of the curve projected onto the source plane ( @xmath47 ) is perpendicular to the local gradient of the surface brightness ( @xmath48 ) , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "while the structure of the lensed image is complicated , in many systems it is reasonable to assume that the structure of the source has some regularity and symmetry .",
    "we require a model for the surface brightness of the source over a very limited region about its center where almost all galaxies can be approximated by an ellipsoidal surface brightness profile .",
    "we assume that the source has a surface brightness @xmath49 which is a monotonically decreasing function , @xmath50 , of an ellipsoidal coordinate @xmath51 .",
    "the source is centered at @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , and its shape is described by the two - dimensional shape tensor @xmath54 . and major axis position angle @xmath55 .",
    "in the principal axis frame the shape tensor @xmath56 is diagonal with components @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the shape tensor @xmath59 is found by rotating the diagonal shape tensor with the rotation matrix @xmath60 ) corresponding to the major axis pa of the source @xmath55 . ]",
    "a non - circular source is essential to explaining the observed rings . with these assumptions ,",
    "the location of the ring depends only the shape of the source and not on its radial structure .",
    "the position of the extremum is simply the solution of @xmath61 the ring curve traces a four ( two ) lobed cloverleaf pattern when projected onto the source plane if there are four ( two ) images of the center of the source ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these lobes touch the tangential caustic at their maximum ellipsoidal radius from the source center , and these cyclic variations in the ellipsoidal radius produce the brightness variations seen around the ring ( see figure 3 ,  3.2 ) .",
    "two problems affect using eqn .",
    "( 7 ) to define the ring curve .",
    "first , it assumes that the image is a surface brightness map . in practice , @xmath62 , so the ring location determined from the data can be distorted by the psf .",
    "one major advantage of fitting the ring curve is that it is insensitive to the effects of the psf  the psf distorts the ring location only when there is a strong flux gradient along the ring .",
    "we see this primarily when the ring contains much brighter point sources , and the problem can be mitigated by fitting and subtracting most of the flux from the point sources before measuring the ring position .",
    "alternatively we can use deconvolved images .",
    "monte carlo experiments with a model for the ring are necessary to determine where the ring curve is biased from the true ring curve by the effects of the psf , but the usual signature is a `` ripple '' in the ring near bright point sources ( as seen between the a1 and a2 images in figure 4 ) .",
    "second , we are assuming that the source is ellipsoidal , although the model could be generalized for more complicated source structures .",
    "we can illustrate the physics governing the shapes of einstein rings using the limit of a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) for the lens .",
    "the general analytic solution for the einstein ring produced by an ellipsoidal source lensed by a singular isothermal galaxy in a misaligned external shear field is presented in appendix a. we use coordinates ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) centered on the lens galaxy .",
    "the sie ( see  2.2 ) has a critical radius scale @xmath29 , ellipticity @xmath65 , and its major axis lies along the @xmath66-axis .",
    "we add an external shear field characterized by amplitude @xmath36 and orientation @xmath37 .",
    "the source is an ellipsoid with axis ratio @xmath67 and major axis angle @xmath55 located at a position of ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) from the lens center .",
    "the tangential critical line of the model is @xmath70 when expanded to first order in the shear and ellipticity .",
    "if we expand the solution for the einstein ring to first order in the shear , lens ellipticity , source ellipticity and source position ( @xmath71 in a four - image lens ) , the einstein ring is located at @xmath72 at this order , the average radius of the einstein ring is the same as that of the tangential critical line .",
    "the quadrupole of the ring has a major axis orthogonal to that of the critical line if the shear and ellipticity are aligned , @xmath73 or @xmath74 , but can be misaligned in the general solution because of the different coefficients for @xmath30 in eqns .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "for an external shear , the ellipticity of the ring is the same as that of the critical line , while for the ellipsoid the ring is much rounder than the critical line .",
    "the ring has a dipole moment when expanded about the center of the lens , such that the average ring position is the source position . at this order",
    ", the ring shape appears not to depend on the source shape .",
    "the higher order multipoles of the ring are important , as can be seen from the very non - ellipsoidal shapes of many observed einstein rings ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the even multipoles of the ring are dominated by the shape of the lens potential while the odd multipoles are dominated by the shape of the source ( see eqn .",
    "their large amplitudes are driven by ellipticity of the source , because the ellipticity of the lens potential is small ( @xmath75 ) even if the lens is flattened ( @xmath76 ) , while the ellipticity of the source is not ( @xmath77 ) . for example , in a circular lens ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) the ring is located at @xmath78\\ ] ] which has only odd terms in its multipole expansion and converges slowly for flattened sources .",
    "the ring shape is a weak function of the source shape only if the potential is nearly round and the source is almost centered on the lens .",
    "the other easily measured quantities for an einstein ring are the locations of the maxima and minima in the brightness along the ring .",
    "figure 3 shows the brightness profiles as a function of the spoke azimuth for the three lenses .",
    "the brightness profile is @xmath79 for a spoke at azimuth @xmath41 and radius @xmath80 determined from eqn .",
    "( 7 ) , and it has an extremum when @xmath81 . for the ellipsoidal model",
    "there are maxima at the images of the center of the host galaxy ( @xmath82 ) , and minima when the ring crosses a critical line and the magnification tensor is singular ( @xmath83 ) . in fact , these are general properties of einstein rings and do not depend on our assumption of ellipsoidal symmetry ( see blandford , surpi & kundic 2000 ) .",
    "the extrema at the critical line crossings are created by having a merging image pair on the critical line .",
    "the two merging images are created from the same source region and have the same surface brightness as the source , so the surface brightness of the ring must be continuous across the critical line .",
    "alternatively , the lobed pattern traced by the ring curve on the source plane ( see figure 1 ) touches the tangential caustic at maxima of the ellipsoidal radius from the source center .",
    "the points where the lobes touch the caustic on the source plane correspond to the points where the ring crosses the critical line on the image plane , so the ring brightness profile must have a minimum at the crossing point .",
    "we can accurately measure the locations of the maxima , since they correspond to the center of the host galaxy or the positions of the quasars .",
    "the positions of the minima , the two or four points where the einstein ring crosses the tangential critical line , are more difficult to measure accurately .",
    "first , if the minimum lies between a close pair of images , like the one between the bright a1/a2 quasar images in pg  1115 + 080 ( see figures 2 and 3 ) , the wings of the psf must be well modeled to measure the position of the minimum accurately .",
    "second , the high tangential magnifications near crossing points reduce the surface brightness gradients along the ring near the minima .",
    "the smaller the gradient , the harder it is to accurately measure the position of the flux minimum .",
    "third , the minima will be more easily affected by dust in the lens than the sharply peaked maxima .",
    "clean , high precision data is needed to accurately measure the crossing points .      the final statistic for estimating the goodness of fit for the ring model has three terms .",
    "the first term is the fit to the overall ring curve .",
    "we measure the ring position @xmath84 and its uncertainty @xmath85 for a series of spokes radiating from a point near the ring center with separations at the ring comparable to the resolution of the observations so that they are statistically independent . given a lens model and the source structure ( @xmath52 , @xmath55 and @xmath67 ) we solve eqn .",
    "( 7 ) to derive the expected position of the ring @xmath86 , and add @xmath87 to our fit statistic for each spoke .",
    "the second term compares the measured position of the ring peaks to the positions predicted from the position of the host galaxy @xmath52 .",
    "we simply match the predicted and observed peak positions using a statistic similar to eqn .",
    "if we also fit the separately measured quasar positions , we must be careful not to double count the constraints . at present , we have used a larger uncertainty for the position of the ring peaks than for the positions of the quasars so that the host center is constrained to closely match that of the quasar without overestimating the constraints on the position of the quasars and host center .",
    "finally , we determine where the observed ring crosses the model critical line and compare it to the positions of the flux minima and their uncertainties , again using a statistic similar to eqn .",
    "because we use the observed rather than the model ring to estimate the positions of the critical line crossings , the constraint is independent of any assumptions about the surface brightness profile of the source",
    ".    we can estimate the measurability of the parameters from simple considerations about the measurement accuracy .",
    "we measure the ring radius at @xmath88 independent points measured around the ring with uncertainties of @xmath89 in the radius of each point .",
    "if we measure the multipole moments of the ring , are @xmath90 for the monopole and @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 . ]",
    "then the uncertainty in the individual components is @xmath94 .",
    "the number of independent measurements is set by the resolution of the observations .",
    "for a psf with full - width at half - maximum @xmath95 , the number of independent measurements is approximately @xmath96 for hst observations of a lens with a critical radius of @xmath97 .",
    "the radius of the ring can be determined to accuracy @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the signal - to - noise ratio of the ring averaged over the resolution element .",
    "hence the multipole moments can be determined to accuracy @xmath100 for typical hst observations . if we compare this to the terms appearing in the shape of the einstein ring , the accuracy with which the ellipticity and shear of the lens can be determined from the shape of the ring is @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the nominal noise level .",
    "the axis ratio of the source can be determined to an accuracy @xmath103 from the higher order terms .",
    "our model for einstein rings works well on synthetic data generated using an ellipsoidal source . the key question , however , is whether it works on real einstein rings . here",
    "we illustrate our results for the einstein ring images of the host galaxies in the lenses pg  1115 + 080 ( impey et al .",

    "since the ring data are very clean compared to pg  1115 + 080 and b  1608 + 656 in the sense that there are no bright point sources or complicated lenses which must be subtracted before extracting the ring , we included the flux minima as a constraint on the models .",
    "the fit to the ring is too good given the formal errors ( for the overall trace we find a @xmath18 per point of @xmath124 , a @xmath18 per flux peak of @xmath125 , and a @xmath18 per flux minimum of @xmath124 ) . from our experience with pg  1115 + 080 and b  1608 + 656",
    "we had settled on a very conservative error model for the ring properties , which is too pessimistic for b  1938 + 666 where it is so much easier to measure the ring properties .",
    "the vlbi component positions were fit less well ( a @xmath18 per component coordinate of @xmath126 ) , in part because the accuracy of the component identifications for the arc images c1 and c2 are probably worse than their formal uncertainties .",
    "the fit is illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "modern observations of gravitational lenses , both in the radio and with hst , routinely find extended lensed structures .",
    "in particular , einstein ring images of the host galaxies of the lensed sources ( agn , radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ) are frequently detected even in short infrared images of gravitational lenses .",
    "the discovery of these additional images is critical to expanding the use of lenses to determine the mass distributions of galaxies and the hubble constant , where the models have been limited by the finite number of constraints supplied by the two or four images of the active nucleus .",
    "we developed a simple theoretical model for einstein rings and demonstrated it using the rings observed in pg  1115 + 080 , b  1608 + 656 and b  1938 + 666",
    ". the assumption of ellipsoidal symmetry for the source works well , and we can accurately and simultaneously determine the shapes of the host galaxy and the lens potential .",
    "contrary to popular belief , the distortions introduced by lensing are not a major complication to studying the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "in fact , host galaxies and gravitational lensing provide a virtuous circle .",
    "the magnification by the lens enormously improves the contrast between the host galaxy and the central engine over unlensed host galaxies ( by factors of @xmath127@xmath128 in surface brightness contrast ! ) .",
    "this makes it significantly easier to find and analyze the host galaxies of high redshift quasars . in return",
    ", the host galaxy provides significant additional constraints on the mass distribution of the lens .",
    "these constraints break the lens model degeneracies which have made it difficult to determine the mass distribution of the lens or the hubble constant from time delay measurements .",
    "since we expect all quasars and agn to have host galaxies , we can obtain these additional constraints for any system where they are needed .",
    "our tests of the method worked extraordinarily well even though the existing observations of the lensed host galaxies were incidental to observations designed to efficiently find and study the lens galaxy ( see falco et al .",
    "the observations were short and could not afford the high overheads for obtaining contemporaneous empirical psfs .",

    "in this section we derive an analytic solution of eqn . ( 7 ) for the einstein ring radius as a function of azimuth for generalized isothermal potentials , @xmath129 , in an external shear field , where @xmath130 is a constant radial scale and we define @xmath131 ( see zhao & pronk 2000 , witt , mao & keeton 2000 ) .",
    "the model includes the sie as a subcase . after defining the radial and tangential unit vectors , @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    ", we find that the source plane tangent vector is @xmath134 where @xmath135 defines the external shear .",

    "note that there is no transformation of the source shape which will eliminate any other variable ( the lens potential , the external shear or the source position ) from the shape of the ring , which means that there are no simple parameter degeneracies between the potential and the source .",
    "if there is no external shear ( @xmath137 ) , then the solution simplifies to @xmath142 if the source is circular and @xmath143 . for comparison ,",
    "the tangential critical radius of the lens is @xmath144   \\left [ { \\ve_r \\cdot \\tg \\cdot \\ve_r \\over |\\tg| } \\right]\\ ] ] we have found no general analytic solutions for models with a different radial dependence for the density , but limited analytic progress can be made for potentials of the form @xmath145 with the source at the origin .",
    "the equation for the ring location is then a quadratic in @xmath146 , @xmath147 where the definition of @xmath148 is modified to be @xmath149 .",
    "the result is of limited use because the source offsets are important in explaining the observed ring shapes .",
    "the radial profile clearly modifies the ring shape , but numerical experiments are required to determine the ability of the ring shape to discriminate between radial mass profiles given the freedom to adjust the source shape and position , the lens shape and the external shear .",
