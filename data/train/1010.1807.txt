    "in fluid mixtures composed of water and a less polar organic liquid , phase separation behavior can be drastically changed by a small amount of salt @xcite .",
    "with addition of a 10@xmath6 mole fraction of hydrophilic salt like nacl , the coexistence curve is typically shifted by a few kelvins upward in the usct case or downward in the lsct case . in some aqueous mixtures ,",
    "even if they are miscible at all @xmath7 at atmosphere pressure without salt , addition of a small amount of salt gives rise to reentrant phase separation behavior @xcite .    with ions added ,",
    "moreover , many groups have also found long - lived heterogeneities ( sometimes extending over a few micrometers ) in one - phase states @xcite and a third phase visible as a thin solid - like plate at a liquid - liquid interface in two - phase states @xcite . a representative system is a mixture of h@xmath8o ( or d@xmath8o ) , tri - methylpyridine ( 3mp ) , and nabr .",
    "the heterogeneities have been detected by dynamic light scattering @xcite , indicating spontaneous formation of aggregates or domains with small diffusion constants .",
    "their size and the volume fraction are @xmath9 and @xmath10 as a typical example .",
    "the third phase have been observed also in isobutylic acid ( iba)-water mixtures without added salt , where the isobutyric acid partly dissociates into butyrate@xmath11 and h@xmath12 ions . in addition , a drastic decrease in the ion mobility was observed in iba - water for high contents of iba @xcite .",
    "recently , mesophases have been observed when sodium tetraphenylborate nabph@xmath13 was added to d@xmath8o-3mp at about @xmath14 m @xcite .",
    "this salt dissociates into hydrophilic na@xmath12 and hydrophobic bph@xmath15 .",
    "the latter ion consists of four phenyl rings bonded to an ionized boron .",
    "dramatic ion effects are ubiquitous in various soft materials such as polymers , gels , colloids , and mixtures containing ionic surfactants . for example , complex effects are known to be induced in polyelectrolytes when a second fluid component ( cosolvent ) is added to water .",
    "in particular , precipitation of dna has been widely observed with addition of alcohol such as ethanol to water @xcite . here",
    "the alcohol added is excluded from condensed dna , which suggests solvation - induced wetting of dna by water .",
    "we also mention observations of crystal formation of micron - sized water - rich droplets in a less polar oil - rich phase with addition of hbr @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of this ordering was ascribed to the coulomb interaction due to asymmetric partitioning of cations and anions in water and oil @xcite .    in these phenomena ,",
    "the solvation ( or hydration ) interaction among ions and polar molecules should play a major role .",
    "small hydrophilic ions are solvated by several water molecules @xcite and the resultant solvation chemical potential per ion much exceeds the thermal energy @xmath16 and strongly depends on the ambient composition of the solvent . on the contrary , some hydrophobic particles dislike to be in contact with water molecules , which tend to form aggregates in water and are more soluble in oil than in water . in aqueous mixtures ,",
    "a hydrophobic ion should be surrounded by oil molecules , which explains the mesophase formation observed by sadakane _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles strongly affect the surrounding hydrogen bonding network in different manners @xcite and the solvation is highly cooperative . furthermore ,",
    "when a small amount of water was added to methanol - cyclohexane , the coexistence curve was largely shifted @xcite and a water - induced , methanol - rich wetting layer appeared ( which was nonexistent without water ) @xcite .",
    "these findings indicate strongly selective molecular interactions between water and the two components .",
    "obviously , the preferential solvation should strongly affect the phase transition behavior in aqueous mixtures with a small amount of hydrophilic or hydrophobic solute , though this aspect has not been well studied .",
    "recently , some efforts have been made to elucidate the solvation effects in phase separation in mixture solvents in electrolytes @xcite , polyelectrolytes@xcite , and ionic surfactants @xcite .",
    "a review on the static properties was presented @xcite . in the dynamics ,",
    "a number of problems still remain unexplored @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a theory of solvation - induced phase separation with hydrophilic or hydrophobic solute .",
    "thus we aim to explain the observed heterogeneities in aqueous mixtures @xcite .",
    "we may suppose hydrophilic monovalent ion pairs such as na@xmath12 and cl@xmath11 in a binary mixture of water and a less polar component ( called oil ) .",
    "as is well - known , hydrophilic ions induce clustering of water molecules around them on microscopic scales , forming a solvation shell @xcite .",
    "we shall see that strongly hydrophilic ions can moreover induce formation of water - rich domains on macroscopic scales for sufficiently strong preference of water over oil .",
    "this can occur even when the mixture is outside the coexistence curve without ions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii , two - phase coexistence induced by the preferential solvation",
    "will be studied numerically and theoretically , where the electrostatic interaction does not appear explicitly . in sec.iii ,",
    "inhomogeneous profiles such as interfaces will be calculated .",
    "we will show that a precipitated droplet can be stable only above a minimum radius due to the surface tension effect and that a solvation - induced prewetting transition occurs far from the coexistence curve without solute . in sec.iv , two - phase coexistence with hydrophilic ions",
    "will be examined in the presence of the charge effect . in sec.v",
    ", we will investigate the precipitation from one - phase states taking place as homogeneous nucleation .",
    "in sec.iv , we will investigate adsorption and precipitation on colloid surfaces .",
    "neglecting electrostatic interaction but accounting for the solvation interaction , we first consider a binary mixture composed of water and a less polar component in a cell with a fixed volume @xmath17 .",
    "the second component will be simply called oil hereafter .",
    "ions will be treated as a dilute third component ( solute ) with density @xmath18 .",
    "we may also suppose strongly hydrophilic or hydrophobic neutral particles ( possibly with a complex structure ) added in an aqueous binary mixture .",
    "such particles can be solvated by a certain number of water or oil molecules depending on whether they are hydrophilic or hydrophobic .    in the following",
    ", we will suppose hydrophilic ions or particles . however , our results can be equally applicable to hydrophobic ions or particles if water and oil are exchanged ( or @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath20 ) .",
