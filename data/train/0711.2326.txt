    "the common downward vertical airshowers , mostly of hadronic nature , are growing as a tree whose wide roots are spread in a conical shape , because at low altitudes vertical shower are randomized into a disk .",
    "the resultant secondaries shine erenkov light on a disk s size which is about twice a moliere radius ( a hundred meter size ) . at high altitudes , inclined shower ( zenith angle @xmath3 ) at lowest air density",
    "are split by geomagnetic lorentz force into two twin charged beams . at their center , energetic muon pair bundles define the shower axis .",
    "these fan - like shape are made by twin pair lobes .",
    "these lobes are shining erenkov lights in different beams and regions ; such an exemplar uhecr inclined event has been foreseen in last years,@xcite , recorded by the auger detector @xcite and discussed recently @xcite : both a erenkov flash ( seen at coihueco ) and a fluorescence flare ( spot by los leones ) were detected while a muon pair bundle hit a dozen of tanks in the heart of the auger array ( see fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] @xcite ) .",
    "let us remark that only one side ( of the two ) of an off - axis blazing erenkov flash ( the beam made by bent negative electrons ) have been revealed by coihueco : because of the wide fan - like shower size , erenkov lights are mostly seen in one main lobe .",
    "only rarely erenkov jets are observed in axis being split far away into their twin lobes ; the higher energy muon bundles survive , being harder than electron ones , reaching the ground almost undeflected along the main shower axis .",
    "such a downward twin spot discover would offer a new uhecr spectroscopy at the horizon ( inclined showers ) @xcite .",
    "erenkov earliest twin lights define , indeed , the uhecr original direction , its most probable cross - section and its consequent primary composition .",
    "erenkov light s intensity and color ( spectra ) , zenith angle , traversed column depth , angular separation , time structure and muons component delay and multiplicity , defines primary energy and composition .",
    "moreover , such a _ pedagogical _ in - axis event , where the lobes split , even if rare could be enhanced by time correlated muon light rings ( by secondary muon erenkov imprint @xcite ) .",
    "the magic - ii telescope array @xcite , as well as veritas and hess , should discover such inclined events if looking horizontally @xcite .",
    "the hope is to prepare at the same time the calibration for rarest but exciting upgoing pev - eev neutrino induced airshowers @xcite . in the present article",
    "we reflect on their cherenkov reflections summarized by the last four figures .",
    "let us remind that at highest energies ( eev ) , fluorescence and erenkov hybrid events at auger ( estimated about a dozen per year @xcite ) may offer an empirical calibration ( see fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] , @xcite ) .",
    "hybrid events by only erenkov twin spots may be extended to lower energies , as tens pev , at more frequent rate . in analogy",
    ", magic may study twin split events : their double spot signature is larger at larger zenith angles though this separation is observed at more and more far edges .",
    "therefore , the angular size between the two lobes first vanishes at vertical than increases at larger zenith angle to a maximum angle .",
    "the erenkov lobes angular size appears to shrink to smaller aperture at higher and higher zenith angles , because of their larger distances at the horizons .",
    "the twin signature should be resolved better by magic telescope than by auger because better resolution .",
    "auger , on the contrary , may enhance and tag the twin lobes by adding tanks around the four fluorescence - erenkov telescopes at coihueco , los leones , los morados and norte : their trigger correlated muon signal may , in fact , trigger the reading of erenkov flashes at the edges , revealing their hidden twin split signature .",
    "while magic observes the far sea , it may reveal reflections of inclined airshowers on the water : in an ideal flat sea , just a twin airshower image would appear , see fig.[fig1 ] , while in a more realistic scrambled water , any ellipse reflected event would be fragmented and diffused at horizon .",
    "the sea water reflectivity increases with zenith angle , but column depth opacity may suppress most of the horizontal showers intensity .",
    "therefore , uhecrs could be indirectly detected by such sea - skimming mostly at bounded inclined zenith angles @xmath4 .",
    "stereoscopic detection would better calibrate the distance , the origin and the primary composition .",
    "polarization of these mirror images may also test the skimming angle .",
    "a complementary reflecting mode takes place on snow , rainy or bright areas nearby the telescope .",
    "magic leaping the earth surface could reveal pevs reflected events , in particular if they are beamed and skimming the ground toward the telescope s direction , see fig.[fig2 ] . moreover , it s possible to observe at once both the deep downward airshower erenkov reflections and part of the airshower lateral fluorescence tail ( see fig.[fig1 ] @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility to use a erenkov telescope in _ reflection mode _ may verify known uhecr rates and morphology .",
    "one can image to use the near ground reflections to enhance the brightness because of the near diffusor distance . in the skimming case ,",
    "the spot seen in perspective will appear as an ellipse the more eccentric the more inclined the shower is , but once re - diffused from ground can reappear on the telescope as a big disk thanks to the in - axis geometry .",
    "clouds are seldom into sky .",
    "high altitude detectors ( magic , veritas ) are often above these clouds : they can work as a blank white screen which could better reveal downward uhecr events , see fig.[fig3 ] . their splitting may be also revealed . the same clouds blanket above the telescope , when sky is overcast , can be used to diffuse the erenkov lights from rare tau upgoing airshower , whose blazing signal may lead to short light spots on such natural huge screens , see fig.[fig4 ] @xcite .",
    "the areas observed by magic are smaller than the ones of auger because of magic smaller solid angle , though longer distances available . however , because of the larger area and smaller energy threshold , magic may reveal pevs neutrino induced signals on nearby clouds .",
    "one should note that the twin magic view toward ( @xcite ) _ and opposite _ grbs - sgrs - bl lac active @xmath0 sources direction , while at horizon , can be performed : while one telescope can follow the source beyond the edge , the second telescope could point , in presence of a cloudy sky , the same direction but _ opposite to _ the source position .",
    "this location is not just a point region but a flat arc , projected by the horizon edges into cloudy sky , where any uhe skimming @xmath5 may rise and flash on such a screen . in this working configuration ,",
    "blazing erenkov flashes ( by @xmath6 , by @xmath7 or by @xmath8 airshowers ) , or eev @xmath5 air - showering may hit one telescope directly while a reflected erenkov spots by upgoing @xmath5 showers would be diffused onto the cloud - screen .",
    "this can better occur after glast era , when daily grb events may trigger magic eyes .",
    "nearly one grb a month may rise at horizons .",
    "airshowers erenkov lights may be reflected while skimming the earth , the sea , the icy or rainy grounds.the magic telescopes ( as well as the veritas ones ) being on top of a mountain , may soon reveal these reflections whose role is also to calibrate the downward uhecr rate . in principle , magic telescope observing large zenith angles , may also search for upgoing tau airshower probably related to grb - sgrs or bl lac brightening . also glashow resonant neutrinos may rise upgoing and blazing airshowers at horizons . because of the atmosphere dimming of far hadronic airshowers at earth atmosphere edges , the nearer @xcite , younger @xciteneutrino induced ones are emerging better , over the far hadronic noise .",
    "in particular the earth skimming hortaus ( horizontal @xmath5s ) @xcite while decaying and showering may , at the same time , blaze at the front and - or flash on the opposite side to the ( eventual ) clouds or by fluorescence in air . the location where these reflection might hit is not a point anti - correlated to the source but a wide arc parallel to the horizon line . all the hadronic inclined air - showers may and must show the geomagnetic splitting whose signature can be a test of uhecr rate and composition from the knee up to gzk energy edges .",
    "just where auger most recent and surprising results on uhecr call for a confirmation @xcite . in larger auger sky ,",
    "similar higher energy uhe tau events ( possibly originated by eev gzk @xcite tau neutrinos ) , events whose spectra and local anisotropy has been recently revealed , must shine in next few years@xcite .",
