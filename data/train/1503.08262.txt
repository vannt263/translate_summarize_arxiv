    "when two , three , four or higher number of filaments propagate in parallel and close trajectories , interflow and observation of extreme events are reported @xcite .",
    "these mergers , with appearing of a strong filament , were called rogue events during the filamentation process .",
    "the coupling between two filaments was experimentally observed for first time in @xcite .",
    "the conditions for optimal coupling were obtained later from kosareva et al . @xcite and the optimum is for filaments with power near to critical for self - focusing and small diameter of the spot @xmath1 .",
    "as it was reported recently in @xcite , depending on the relative phase and the incidence angle , the filament can experience fusion , repulsion , energy redistribution and spirial motion . the experiments in xenon gas were performed with several gigawatts input peak power @xcite to obtain parallel filament strings with numbers @xmath2 .",
    "the laser pulse breaks up from spatially homogeneous beam profile into several highly localized filament strings each with pulse power slightly above the critical for self - focusing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is the reason to look for nonlinear optical mechanisms leading to exchange of energy or mergers during the process of multifilament propagation .",
    "the three dimensional localization appears similar to the soliton interaction in one - dimensional system as optical fibers , and based on clamping effects due to cpm @xcite and fppm @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear interaction process in fibers strongly depends on the initial phase difference between the pulses .    in this paper",
    "we propose a nonlinear vector model , where in details is investigated the role of cpm and degenerate fppm processes in respect to the relative movements of laser filaments .",
    "we investigate numerically the interaction between optical pulses in the cases when : 1 ) the initial phase difference between pulses is not equal to zero @xmath3 and 2 ) the initial optical pulses admit equal phases @xmath4 .",
    "thus , by properly selected initial conditions , we take into account the fppm process as addition to the cpm influence .",
    "the proposed nonlinear vector model is investigated numerically on the base of the split - step fourier method .",
    "we introduce by the moment formalism nonlinear acceleration and potentials between the weight centrums of the pulses .",
    "as it was pointed in @xcite , the filamentation process can be described more correctly by using the generalized nonlinear operator    @xmath5    which includes additional processes associated with third harmonic generation .",

    "the operator @xmath13 generalizes the case of marker and terhune s operator , and includes to the self - action terms , cpm terms , fppm terms and also additional terms associated with third - harmonic generation ( thg ) .",
    "the initial laser pulses @xmath14 possess a relatively narrow - band spectrum @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the spectral pulse width ) . during the filamentation process the initial self - focusing broadens significantly the pulse spectrum .",
    "the broad - band spectrum @xmath17 is one of the basic characteristics of the stable filament .",
    "the dynamics of broad - band pulses can be presented properly within different non - paraxial models such as uppe @xcite or non - paraxial envelope equations @xcite .",
    "another standard restriction in the filamentation theory is the use of one - component scalar approximation of the electrical field @xmath18 .",
    "this approximation though , is in contradiction with recent experimental results , where rotation of the polarization vector is observed @xcite . for this reason , in the present paper we use the non - paraxial vector model up to second order of dispersion , in which the nonlinear effects are described by the nonlinear polarization components ( [ polth ] ) .",

    "are not stationary _ and as it can be seen from the expressions ( [ accelgs ] ) and ( [ pot ] ) depend in addition on the time .",
    "that is why the spatial forms and the spectrums of the pulses at short distances are modulated significantly .",
    "the numerical experiments demonstrate , that if the pulses are separated along @xmath27 direction , the forms and the @xmath28 spectrums of the both pulses become asymmetric .",
    "we have developed a vector model to describe the processes of reduction of number of the filaments as well as the observation of mergers and rogue events during multi - filament propagation .",
