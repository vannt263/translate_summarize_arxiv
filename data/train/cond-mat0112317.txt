    "if there is a well - established fact about regional seismicity this is the relationship between the magnitude of an earthquake and its frequency , known as the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law @xcite .",
    "this law is of the power - law type when magnitudes are expressed in terms of rupture area @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of observed earthquakes with rupture area greater than @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the so - called @xmath3-value , which is a `` universal constant '' in the range 0.8 - 1.2 @xcite .",
    "the gr law implies that earthquakes are , on a regional or world - wide scale , a self - similar phenomenon lacking a characteristic scale ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to notice , however , that the gr law is a property of _ regional _ seismicity , appearing when we average seismicity over big enough areas and long enough time intervals .",
    "recently , a wealth of new data has been collected to extract statistics on _ individual _ systems of earthquake faults @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been found that the distribution of earthquake magnitudes may vary substantially from one fault to another and that , in general , this type of size - frequency ( sf ) relationship is different from the gr law . many single faults or fault zones display power - law distributions only for _ small _ events , which occur in the intervals between roughly quasi - periodic earthquakes of much larger size which rupture the entire fault .",
    "these earthquakes are termed `` characteristic '' , and the resulting sf relationship , characteristic earthquake ( ce ) distribution .",
    "there is much debate about the origin of the ce distribution @xcite . because of the short period of instrumental earthquake records and the scarcity of paleoseismic studies @xcite , the statistics of naturally occurring earthquakes in single faults are poor",
    "this fact justifies the development of `` synthetic seismicity '' models @xcite , in which long catalogs of events are generated by computer models of seismogenesis .",
    "such models can be tuned by requiring that they reproduce what is known of the statistics of past seismicity to a reasonable degree , and then use them to forecast statistical inferences about the behavior of seismicity using much longer and homogeneous catalogs of synthetic events .",
    "many different seismicity models have been presented in the past twenty years or so .",
    "robinson and benites @xcite classify these modeling approaches into five groups : ( 1 ) cellular automata models , ( 2 ) spring - block models , ( 3 ) models of single faults in which slip is discretized into patches and obey simplified friction laws , ( 4 ) continuum models that utilize realistic constitutive friction laws , and ( 5 ) actual physical models .",
    "cellular automata models @xcite have only recently appeared in seismological literature , hand in hand with the concept of self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "these models are usually nondeterministic and represent faults as one- or two - dimensional features .",
    "they neglect the details of both elasticity and fault friction , substituting them by simple cellular automata rules . despite their simplicity , they are able to reproduce various types of sf statistics , including gr and ce distributions @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients of any of these models are : ( 1 ) the dimensionality of the fault ( 1d or 2d ) , ( 2 ) the number of faults included in the model ( one , a few , or many faults ) , ( 3 ) the employed stress transfer mechanism ( nearest - neighbors , long - range elasticity , mean - field ) , ( 4 ) the degree of incorporation of inertial effects ( quasi - static , quasi - dynamic , or fully dynamic ) , ( 5 ) the assumed constitutive stress - slip law ( experimental , static - dynamic , velocity - weakening , etc . ) , and ( 6 ) the degree of stress conservation ( conservative versus dissipative models ) .",
    "various discrete models of seismicity are able to show a transition from gr to ce statistics . among them , we want to cite here the models of ceva and perazzo @xcite , carlson _",
    "et al_. @xcite , lomnitz - adler @xcite , rundle and klein @xcite , ben - zion and rice @xcite , dahmen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , moreno _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and heinz and zller @xcite .",
    "all of them have in common a transition from a gr to a ce distribution when some of the model parameters are continuously changed .",
    "some authors interpret the results in the light of soc ( e.g. @xcite ) ; others appeal to percolation theory ( @xcite ) ; and still others talk about generic critical point behaviour ( @xcite ) .",
    "but there is no consensus about the origin of these spatiotemporal complexities , with two extreme views : the view that says that the spatiotemporal complexity is generated by the dynamics of the fault , and the opposite view that favors nonuniformities in geometry and material properties as the cause of this complexity .",
    "our purpose here is to build the simplest cellular automaton model of seismicity capable of displaying a sf relationship of the ce type .",
    "that is , a model which exhibits a power - law relationship for small events and an excess of big event ( of the order of the system size ) , together with a very low probability of events of intermediate size . with respect to the six basic ingredients of discrete models of seismicity introduced above",
    ", the model presented here is ( 1 ) one - dimensional , ( 2 ) for a single fault , ( 3 ) with a percolation - like stress - transfer mechanism , ( 4 ) quasi - static , ( 5 ) static / dynamic with total stress drop , and ( 6 ) dissipative .",
    "also , because of the inherent simplicity of the model , we want to be able to derive analytically some of the statistical properties of the resulting synthetic seismicity using markov chains .",
    "consider a one dimensional vertical array of length @xmath1 .",
    "the ordered positions , or levels , in the array will be labeled by an integer index @xmath4 varying from @xmath5 to @xmath1 .",
    "this system performs two functions , it is loaded by receiving individual particles in the various positions of the array , and unloaded by emitting groups of particles through the first level , @xmath6 , which are called avalanches or earthquakes .",
    "these two functions proceed with the following four rules :    1 .",
    "the incoming particles arrive at the system at a constant time rate .",
    "thus , the time interval between each two succesive particles will be considered the basic time unit in the evolution of the system .",
    "all the positions in the array , from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , have the same probability of receiving a new particle .",
    "when a position receives a particle we say that it is occupied .",
    "if a new particle comes to a level which is already occupied , this particle disappears from the system , or in other words , this particle assignment is wasted .",
    "thus , a given position @xmath4 can only be either non - occupied when no particle has come to it , or occupied when one or more particles have come to it .",
    "4 .   the level @xmath6 is special .",
    "when a particle goes to this first position an avalanche occurs .",
    "then , if all the successive levels from @xmath6 up to @xmath8 are occupied , and the position @xmath9 is unoccupied , the effect of the avalanche is to unload all the levels from @xmath6 up to @xmath8 . hence , the size of this avalanche is @xmath10 , and the remaining levels @xmath11 remain unaltered in their occupancy .",
    "thus , from what has been mentioned above , this model has no parameter ; the size @xmath1 is the unique specification to be made , and the spatial correlation is induced by the iv_th _ rule .",
    "now , the state of the system is given by stating which of the ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 levels are occupied .",
    "each of these states corresponds to a stable configuration , and therefore the total number of possible configurations is @xmath14 .",
    "we use the term `` total occupancy '' for the configuration in which all but the first level are occupied .    after the occurrence of an avalanche",
    "the system is left in a stable configuration ; the following particle additions go progressively loading the system , and when a particle is again assigned to the first level a new avalanche is triggered .",
    "each avalanche empties the lower levels of the system as explained in rule ( iv ) , and the system is left in another stable configuration .",
    "the size of the avalanches can range from 1 up to @xmath1 and the avalanche of maximum size , @xmath15 , will be called the characteristic one .    from these evolution rules",
    "we deduce that after a time unit , i.e. , after a new incoming particle assignment , we will have an avalanche if the new particle goes to @xmath6 , and this occurs with a probability @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , with a probability of @xmath17 there will be no avalanche . in this case",
    "the system will advance one unit in its level of occupation when the new particle is assigned to a non - occupied level , and it will remain at the same configuration if the assigned level was already occupied .    as this model is 1-dimensional , extensive monte carlo simulations can be performed to accurately explore its properties . in this paper",
    "we focus on two important properties , the avalanche size - frequency relation and the statistics of the time of return of the maximum - size avalanche .",
    "the results for the avalanche size - frequency relation , @xmath18 , are drawn in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] and written in table  [ table:1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we have superposed @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . this has been partly included in table  [ table:1 ] as well . in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] there are three notable properties to be commented on . first and most important , we see that the characteristic avalanche , @xmath15 , has a much higher probability of occurrence than the avalanches of big size but with @xmath22 . in fact , for @xmath19 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the probability of their respective characteristic avalanches does not differ much , and is near @xmath25 .",
    "we can express this fact by saying that in this model , _ grosso modo _",
    ", one would likely only observe very small avalanches and the characteristic one .",
    "secondly , forgetting for a moment the case @xmath15 , we observe an approximate power law behavior , a la gutenberg - richter , for the rest of avalanches .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 of this differential distribution is roughly 1.6 .",
    "and thirdly , we observe the perfect coincidence of these curves of probability for systems of different size @xmath1 .",
    "this is also appreciated in the numbers collected in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "this , in a sense , unexpected size - invariance will be discussed in detail in the next section .    in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we represent the probability curve for  the time of recurrence of the characteristic avalanche \" .",
    "this curve , obtained by monte carlo simulations , corresponds to a system of @xmath19 . in the abscissas axis ,",
    "time ( denoted by @xmath26 ) starts at 0 just after the occurrence of a @xmath15 avalanche .",
    "it is clear in this model that only after a minimum time lapse of size @xmath1 the probability of occurrence of a new @xmath15 avalanche can be non null .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] that after this minimum time lapse , @xmath27 grows to a maximum and then decays . for the size @xmath19 analyzed in this figure",
    ", the maximum of probability corresponds to a time interval @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to become convinced that , for a given @xmath1 , the @xmath14 stable configurations of our model can be considered as the states of a finite , irreducible and aperiodic markov chain with a unique stationary distribution @xcite .",
    "these configurations are classified in groups according to its _ occupation number _ ( number of occupied levels ) ; the number of configurations with @xmath29 occupied levels is @xmath30 .",
    "one step in the chain corresponds to the result of adding a new particle to the system . up to approximately @xmath31",
    ", the transition matrix , @xmath32 , can be easily obtained using mathematica as well as the corresponding stationary probabilities for each configuration , which correspond to the components of the eigenvector of @xmath32 with eigenvalue , @xmath33 , equal to unity .    for small @xmath1 , @xmath32 and its eigenvectors",
    "are obtained by inspection .",
    "let us then start reproducing the first numbers quoted in table  [ table:1 ] for the probabilities of occurrence of avalanches in systems of small size . with this aim ,",
    "let us consider fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] . there , in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) there appear all the stable configurations , ordered in an increasing state of occupation , for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , respectively . for the moment",
    ", the black level in the top position of the configurations has no meaning .    for @xmath34 , using the same order and notation for the configurations as in fig .",
    "[ figure3]a , the transition probabilities are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath41    this @xmath32 is a doubly stochastic matrix and hence the two stationary probabilities are equal .",
    "@xmath42 for @xmath35 , the non - null transition probabilities are : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ; @xmath46 , @xmath47 ; @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath53 and the components of the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath54 are : @xmath55    finally , for @xmath36 the non - null transition probabilities are @xmath56 .",
    "thus    @xmath57    and , after its diagonalization , one finds @xmath58 from these numbers , one deduces that in a system with @xmath34 levels one should expect avalanches of size @xmath59 with a probability @xmath60 , and of size @xmath61 with @xmath62 . in @xmath35 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . and in @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we have observed that in systems with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 levels , the value of @xmath71 is a constant equal to @xmath72 and this result coincides with table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "we have also observed that in @xmath35 and @xmath36 the value of @xmath73 is a constant equal to @xmath74 , and in @xmath66 we have deduced that @xmath75 .",
    "all this agrees with table  [ table:1 ] .    a conclusive argument proving that in this model the value of @xmath18 is a constant independent on the size @xmath1 is obtained by re - analyzing fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] from a wider perspective .",
    "now we consider that in fig .",
    "[ figure3]a , the configuration labeled by @xmath76 represents , in a system of size @xmath1 , all the configurations in which the level @xmath77 is not - occupied ; the rest of the levels @xmath78 are in any possible state of occupation ( this is represented by the black level at the top of the configuration ) . and in fig .",
    "[ figure3]a , configuration @xmath3 , we consider a system of size @xmath1 which has its second level occupied .",
    "the probabilities of these two cases must add to unity . then defining a markov chain for these two excluding states , and using the same notation as before , we find @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "the diagonalization of this matrix leads for @xmath81 and @xmath82 to the same results written in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) , @xmath83 ; however , its interpretation now is different . here",
    ", @xmath84 implies that for any value of @xmath1 , the probability of having an avalanche @xmath59 is 1/2 ; and @xmath85 simply means that the probability of having avalanches @xmath86 is 1/2 . using the same line of reasoning , and referring to fig .",
    "[ figure3]b , configuration @xmath76 represents all the configurations , in a system of size @xmath1 , where levels @xmath87 and @xmath88 are not occupied .",
    "and configuration @xmath3 represents all the configurations where the level @xmath89 is free and the level @xmath90 is occupied , etc .",
    "then , the non null transition probabilities are @xmath91 .",
    "the diagonalization of this matrix provides the same stationary probabilities quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.2 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath92 means that for an arbitrary @xmath1 , the probability of occurrence of avalanches of size 2 , @xmath73 is @xmath74 . and the fact that @xmath93 confirms that for any @xmath1 , @xmath94 .    extending this line of reasoning to the 8 configurations drawn in fig .",
    "[ figure3]c , one concludes that , for any @xmath1 , @xmath95 and one verifies the previous conclusions @xmath94 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , in this model , if for the system of size n one knows all the @xmath18 from @xmath59 to @xmath15 , then for the system of size @xmath97 the @xmath18 are identical , with the exception of the last two , and these fulfill @xmath98 the recursive way in which @xmath99 divides into @xmath100 and @xmath101 is , however , non trivial .",
    "let us analyze now , from the markov - chains point of view , the results for the time of return of the characteristic earthquake shown in fig .  [ figure2 ] .",
    "after a @xmath102 avalanche , the system is left in the configuration of no occupancy ( for the present discussion we will refer to this configuration as @xmath103 ) .",
    "a new characteristic avalanche will occur when , starting from the configuration @xmath103 , the system reaches the configuration of total occupancy ( which will henceforth be denoted by @xmath104 ) , and then the next particle is assigned to the @xmath6 level . the number of time steps elapsed between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , plus 1 , will be denoted by @xmath26 . and our purpose is to compute the probability of occurrence of a @xmath15 avalanche as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "it must be understood that between @xmath103 and the occurrence of the next @xmath15 avalanche on time @xmath26 , the system may have visited @xmath104 an arbitrary number of times but without triggering any @xmath15 avalanche . in other words , in those visits there has been no transition from @xmath104 to @xmath103 .    in markov chains ,",
    "the transition matrix @xmath32 gives the probability of going from one configuration to another in one step , and the @xmath105 step transition probability is the @xmath105-th power of @xmath32 .",
    "thus a simple way to compute @xmath27 is the following :    1 .",
    "take @xmath32 , point to the element in the last row and the first column , and substitute it by 0 .",
    "we will denote the new matrix @xmath106 .",
    "2 .   compute @xmath107 .",
    "3 .   take the element of the first row and the last column of @xmath108 , and multiply it by @xmath16 .",
    "this result is @xmath27 .",
    "this is clear , because @xmath106 does not permit transitions from @xmath104 to @xmath103 .",
    "thus , in @xmath108 we have all the probabilities of transitions , in @xmath109 steps , between all the configurations , with the restriction that from @xmath104 to @xmath103 this transit is forbidden .",
    "hence , in @xmath108 the matrix element of the first row and the last column corresponds to the transition from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , in @xmath109 steps and with the mode @xmath110 locked . finally , as the @xmath16 factor is the probability of the transition @xmath110 , we actually have built @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , for @xmath19 , we see the perfect match between the monte carlo simulations and the results coming the theory of markov , calculated using mathematica .    in order to get a quantitative insight on @xmath27 ,",
    "let us apply this method to @xmath111 . in this case , @xmath32 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) . hence , @xmath112 and , therefore , @xmath113 thus , we observe that the asymptotic fall - off behavior of @xmath27 is of the type @xmath114 it is important to recall that in aperiodic , irreducible and finite markov chains such as that of our model , the mean waiting time for a configuration is the inverse of the stationary probability of that configuration .",
    "then , the mean time between characteristic avalanches in this model is @xmath115    as an example , for @xmath36 , @xmath116 time units .",
    "we have presented a one - dimensional discrete model of seismicity that displays a size - frequency spectrum similar to that expected from a characteristic - earthquake behavior . although this stochastic model obviously lacks the explicit physics of other detailed and complex dynamical models of earthquakes , its basic hypotheses and implications are clear , phenomenologically reasonable and coherent .",
    "the size invariance of this model , also surprisingly manifests itself in predicting an identical probability of occurrence for earthquakes of the same magnitude independently of the size @xmath1 of the system . in this universal rule",
    "the characteristic earthquake is excluded .",
    "this model has the additional bonus that several important predictions can be algebraically derived by using the theoretical framework of the markov chains .",
    "specifically , the statistics of the time of return of the characteristic earthquake are neatly predicted by this formalism .",
    "dahmen et al .",
    "@xcite report a model able to transit from the gr to the ce behavior and , what is more interesting , these authors define a  configurational entropy \" as an appropriate concept that reflects in which of these two extreme behaviors the system is actually operating . in qualitative terms",
    ", the gr behavior corresponds to a high entropy mode of operation while the ce behavior corresponds to a low entropy mode .",
    "therefore , we would like to make an assesment of our model from this configurational entropy point of view and check the concordance , or not , with the conclusions of ref .",
