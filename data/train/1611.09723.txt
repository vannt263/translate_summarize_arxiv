    "wireless networks are already large and complex today , and being at the heart of the so - called internet of things ( iot ) @xcite , are expected to grow even denser in the future @xcite .",
    "the rapid increase in wireless applications has led to an increasing demand for scarce wireless spectrum , and hence it is necessary to make the most efficient use of the limited available capacity . obviously ,",
    "when the number of nodes is large , in the hundreds or even thousands of nodes , a dedicated medium or channel can not be assigned to each node , and nodes have to share the medium .",
    "multiple simultaneous node transmissions on the same channel will however inevitably give rise to interference and loss of throughput .",
    "medium access control ( mac ) mechanisms are crucial to resolve this contention",
    ". however , in large networks , a centralized control mechanism is hard to implement and to maintain since it would require constant status updates generating prohibitive communication overhead . for this reason",
    "the design of efficient distributed ( local ) mac protocols has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "a very popular distributed mac mechanism is the csma ( carrier - sense multiple - access ) protocol , which is currently at the core of the ieee 802.11 and 802.15.4 standards .",
    "its popularity is mostly due to its simplicity and efficiency .",
    "the key feature of the csma protocol is that each node waits for a random back - off period before initiating a transmission .",
    "interference is avoided since the back - off countdown is interrupted whenever potential interference is sensed , and only resumed once the medium is sensed idle again .",
    "this protocol , whilst extremely easy to understand on a local level , generates complex and interesting macroscopic network dynamics .    in the performance analysis of csma networks ,",
    "a common assumption is the existence of an underlying graph that represents interference between the various nodes in the network .",
    "an edge between two nodes means that destructive interference is caused by simultaneous transmission . both empirical and theoretical support for the notion of an interference graph",
    "is provided in @xcite .",
    "when the nodes always have packets to transmit , the network is said to be _ saturated _ and the macroscopic activity behavior is amenable to analysis under the assumption of an interference graph . in particular",
    ", the activity process has an elegant product - form stationary distribution @xcite .",
    "the computation of the stationary distribution of the activity process reduces to the identification of all the subsets of nodes which may transmit simultaneously , namely the independent sets of the interference graph .",
    "real - life scenarios however involve _ unsaturated _ networks .",
    "packets arrive at the various nodes according to exogenous processes , and buffers may drain from time to time as packets are transmitted . in particular , in iot applications , sources are likely to generate packets only sporadically , with fairly tight delay constraints , and often have empty buffers . since empty nodes temporarily refrain from the medium competition , the activity process is strictly intertwined with the buffer content process . in this situation , the product - form solution no longer holds @xcite and an exact stationary analysis does not seem tractable . furthermore , not even stability conditions for the queueing dynamics in the nodes buffers are known , let alone results for the stationary distribution of the buffer content process .",
    "the analysis of unsaturated csma networks simplifies if certain symmetry conditions amongst the various nodes hold .",
    "an important instance is when there is a substantial number of nodes with similar traffic and placement in the network , so that the operation of one is equivalent to that of many others .",
    "more generally , nodes can be divided into classes with the symmetry conditions now applying to nodes of the same class .",
    "the asymptotic regime where the number of such nodes in each class grows to infinity , is often referred to as a _",
    "mean - field regime_. mean - field theory originated in physics , where it is still largely used in the study of models involving a large number of interacting particles .",
    "the aggregated effect of all the other particles on any tagged particle is approximated by a single averaged effect ( the mean - field ) , thus reducing a many - body problem to a tractable one - body problem .",
    "mean - field analysis has since been exploited in various scientific areas , from epidemic models to queueing systems and from biology to game theory . in the context of random - access networks a mean - field regime , not only provides analytical tractability , but is also highly relevant in the context of the envisioned massive numbers of iot devices .",
    "a thorough survey of mean - field analysis of random - access protocols is presented in @xcite .",
    "the work of bianchi @xcite is a landmark paper which assumed a propagation of chaos property to hold so as to derive tractable formulae for the key performance measures of the system .",
    "the papers surveyed in @xcite mostly use mean - field theory to provide either evidence or objection for the propagation of chaos assumption of bianchi . among these papers , it is worth mentioning @xcite , where the authors investigated the existence of a global attractor for the mean - field system and provided sufficient conditions for its existence , deducing the validity of bianchi s assumption .",
    "further papers which deserve to be mentioned are @xcite , where the authors exploited mean - field theory so as to obtain approximations for key performance measures of large systems .",
    "in particular @xcite focuses on the characterization of the stability region , while @xcite examines the throughput performance of the system .",
    "none of the above - mentioned papers considered scenarios with unsaturated buffers , with the exception of @xcite , which however dealt with systems evolving in discrete time and did not consider performance metrics like packet delays .      in the present paper",
    "we examine the buffer dynamics in large - scale unsaturated random - access networks .",
    "specifically , we analyze the buffer occupancy processes in a mean - field regime where the number of nodes grows large .",
    "such a mean - field regime not only furnishes analytical tractability , but is also particularly relevant in understanding the collective behavior of massive numbers of interacting iot sources .    the paper has two main interrelated threads .",
    "the first part in section [ sec_gen ] deals with networks with general interference graphs .",
    "we prove that a suitably scaled version of the buffer occupancy processes converges in the mean - field limit to a tractable deterministic initial - value problem .",
    "we also establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point of the initial - value problem , and provide a characterization the fixed point as the solution of a low - dimensional equation .",
    "the second part focuses on scenarios with a complete interference graph .",
    "we demonstrate in section [ sec_compl ] global asymptotic stability of the initial - value problem , i.e. , convergence to the unique fixed point from any initial state with finite mass , and then proceed to show positive recurrence of the pre - limit process and tightness .",
    "we combine these properties to prove interchange of the mean - field and steady - state limits . in section [ sec_tag ] the interchange of limits",
    "is then leveraged to establish that the stationary buffer content distributions at the various nodes converge to geometric distributions while the stationary distributions of the scaled waiting time and sojourn time converge to exponential distributions .",
    "the parameters of these limiting distributions are directly expressed in terms of the fixed point of the initial - value problem .",
    "these results provide asymptotically exact approximations for the stationary waiting - time and sojourn time distributions , which in fact turn out to be remarkably accurate , even for a relatively moderate number of nodes .",
    "mean - field limits for various model extensions are briefly discussed in section [ sec_extension ] , illustrating the versatility of the methodology . in section [ sec_num ]",
