    "generally , these processes are actively carried out by enzymatic molecules called motor proteins or molecular motors @xcite . in cellular transport , they utilize chemical energy , released from chemical reactions that they catalyze such as hydrolysis of atp , to deliver cargoes by their active movement along cytoskeletal filaments @xcite .",
    "the proper functioning of motor protein transport is crucial for the cell s survival .",

    "these interactions is estimated within an energy range @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath3 is the thermodynamic temperature .",
    "one can assume similar kind of interactions among other cytoskeletal motors such as myosin and dynein , which are also involved in cellular transport .",
    "it is expected that these interactions alter various chemical transitions occurring at microscopic level . these include binding and unbinding , backward stepping , forward moving , hydrolysis , etc which affect their mechano - chemistry and hence collective dynamics .",
    "however , the influence of these interactions on collective transport of motor proteins needs much more investigation .",
    "it is significantly important to combine the microscopic properties of motor proteins with their collective transport motion @xcite .",
    "totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) has become a paradigmatic model to study collective motion of active particles that hop stochastically and uni - directionally along a linear segment obeying the hard - core exclusion principle .",

    "recently , a new class of single - channel open tasep has been introduced , which provides quantitative description for chemical transitions on motor proteins using fundamental thermodynamic concepts @xcite . the simple mean field theory which completely ignores particle - particle correlations , deviates from understanding the interacting tasep dynamics .",

    "the available approximation theories which capture correlations are limited to one channel @xcite and can not be simply extended to multi - channel system .    in this paper",
    ", an effort has been made to analyze the collective dynamics of interacting molecular motors working on a symmetrically coupled parallel filaments .",
    "the inter - channel interactions are incorporated by modifying the simple transitions rules of original two - channel open tasep model using a fundamental thermodynamic procedure .",

    "the state of occupancy of @xmath6 site @xmath7 of lane @xmath8 ( 1 or 2 ) is characterized by an occupation variable @xmath9 , where @xmath9 = 0 denotes empty state of site @xmath10 of lane @xmath8 and @xmath9 = 1 represents its occupied state .    besides the exclusion principle",
    ", particles in a channel can interact horizontally with its nearest neighbors via energy @xmath11 associated to the bond connecting two neighboring particles .",
    "here , the horizontal hopping in both channels takes place under a short - range interactive strength @xmath11 or is driven by an external field @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes attractive ( repulsive ) interaction . such type of short - range interactions",

    ", we have considered the lane changing rate to be independent of interactions present in the model .",

    ", the particle deforms the bond but simultaneously does nt join a cluster . for the last possibility , @xmath24 = 0 and @xmath25 = 1 ( figure [ fig2](b ) and ( f ) ) , the particle hops with a rate @xmath26 when @xmath27 otherwise the hopping rate is @xmath28 . in this case , there is only formation of the bond . besides all these transitions",
    ", the particle at @xmath29 site can jump to site @xmath19 with a rate @xmath14 when the horizontal transition is not possible and the target site is empty .    in the proposed model , an open environment",
    "is considered , where particles enter from left and leave the system from last sites .",
    "the effect of interactions at both the boundaries are considered as follows : at left boundary , a particle can enter with rate @xmath30 if it forms the bond with its neighbor , otherwise the rate is @xmath31 .",
    "the transition rate of a particle at right boundary depends not only on the occupancy state of its left neighbor but also on the state of @xmath32 site of the other lane . when there is no deformation of the bond , particle leaves with rate @xmath33 for @xmath34 , otherwise the rate is @xmath35 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . for the case of deformation ,",
    "the hopping rate of particle is @xmath36 when site @xmath37 is occupied , otherwise the rate is @xmath38 .    the formation and deformation of bonds can be viewed as opposing chemical transitions @xcite which gives the following relationship between the transition rates : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "further , the hopping rates @xmath26 and @xmath22 can be explicitly expressed in terms of dimensionless parameter @xmath41 ( 0 @xmath42 as @xmath43 the splitting parameter ( @xmath41 ) specifies the effect of energy on these transition rates .",
    "it is to be noted that all transition rates corresponding to breaking and formation of bonds satisfy the relationship given by equation ( [ eq1 ] ) . when there are attractive interactions ( @xmath44 ) , the rate of formation of bond is larger ( @xmath45 while the rate of deformation of the bond is smaller ( @xmath46 .",
    "but , the rate for creating and breaking of these bonds becomes smaller @xmath47 and larger @xmath48 , respectively for repulsive interactions ( @xmath49 ) . in the absence of intra - channel interactions",
    ", the model reduces to symmetrically coupled original two - channel tasep model @xcite .",
    "also , single channel tasep model with nearest neighbor interactions is reproduced for the case of no inter - channel transitions in our system @xcite .",
    "the proposed model is suitable to study the role of interactions in the collective dynamics on a symmetrically coupled two - channel transport process .",
    "the transition rules adopted here are consistent with the motion of motor proteins as the forward hoping rates in one channel depend not only on the number of bonds that remain unchanged , increased or decreased but also on the configuration of the other channel .",
    "the direct and indirect coupling in both the channels make the dynamics complex and difficult to analyze .      single - channel original tasep is one of the few models that has been solved by exact theoretical methods @xcite under both open and closed boundary conditions . for other variants of tasep ,",
    "collective dynamics have been analyzed by using only approximate theoretical methods @xcite . also , for the case of interactive single channel open tasep system , recently , a approximated theory , called modified cluster mean field was proposed @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of multi - channel interacting tasep system , neither an exact nor an approximate theory exist so far that can deal with the interactions . in this direction , we make a first attempt by developing an approximate theory that can handle the correlations produced in a symmetrically coupled interactive two channel tasep system .    in the next subsection , we first discuss an existing approximation approach that can incorporate the effect of inter - channel transitions and show that it is insufficient to incorporate intra - channel interactions . in its following subsection ,",
    "modified vertical cluster mean field ( mvcmf ) theory is proposed that incorporates the effect of both inter and intra channel transitions .",
    ": + for a two - channel original tasep system coupled either in symmetric , partially asymmetric or fully asymmetric fashion , vertical cluster mean field ( vcmf ) approach @xcite has been utilized to analyze steady state properties of the system and to produce the density profiles which matches exactly with those obtained with the direct monte - carlo simulation . as the proposed model involved two - channel tasep coupled symmetrically , where hopping rates are modified to include interactions , it will be an obvious choice to investigate the effect of interactions on the stationary properties of the system using the well examined vcmf approach .",
    "one can easily compute an expression of bulk current for the proposed system using this theory and check that the large attractive interactions cause bulk current to increase without any bound ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this behavior of bulk current is not physically acceptable .",
    "it is because , in the presence of stronger attractive interactions , particles will bound to form larger clusters , which hinders any movement of particles .",
    "this pitfall of vcmf theory is due to the fact that it utilizes the mean field approximation to calculate bulk current which ignores the correlations between two neighboring vertical clusters . since",
    ", these correlations are introduced due to intra - channel interactions present in our system , which significantly effects the movement of particles , thus they can not be ignored .",
    "similar criticism for the mean field approximation has been made for a single channel interactive system @xcite . to overcome the incapability of the mean field approximation for this system , a modified cluster mean field theory has been recently developed .",
    "this theory predicted appropriate finite maximal current in the presence of strong attractive interactions and also genuinely produced the steady state phase diagrams of one - channel system .    in almost all biological networks ,",
    "motor proteins actively participate and interact with their neighboring motors in its lane as well as other lanes .",
    "it is significantly important to study the collective dynamics of motor proteins under both inter and intra channel interactions .",
    "this motivates us to develop a generalized approach which we discuss in the following subsection .      :",
    "+        for a non - zero vertical transition rate , vcmf theory deals with four possible vertical clusters of @xmath6 site of both the channels . each single vertical cluster for @xmath6 site can be found in one of the four states @xmath50 and @xmath51 with probabilities @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , as shown in figure [ fig3](a ) . here , @xmath54",
    "( @xmath53 ) denotes the probability when both of its sites are empty ( occupied ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the probability when only its upper ( lower ) site is occupied .",

    "each such cluster is classified in four different states @xmath61 , and @xmath62 with probabilities @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively , as shown in figure [ fig3](b ) .",
    "note that this classification is based on the occupancy of particles at two neighboring sites of lane 1 and includes all possible configuration of the two neighboring sites of lane 2 . in the similar fashion ,",
    "configurations for lane 2 can be defined .",

    "first vertical cluster of configuration @xmath71 can exists in any of the two states @xmath72 and @xmath73 with their respective probability as @xmath55 and @xmath53 . while the second vertical cluster can exists in one of the two states @xmath74 and @xmath75 with probability @xmath54 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath76 , which is same as computed by vcmf theory .",
    "however , the probability @xmath69 in equation ( [ eq.(6a ) ] ) also includes the effect of intra - channel interactions in the coupled two - channel system .",
    "it can be understood as a product of two probabilities .",

    "the remaining term , @xmath79 , gives the probability that second vertical cluster is either in state @xmath74 or @xmath75 knowing that the first vertical cluster is in state @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "other equations ( [ eq.(6b ) ] ) - ( [ eq.(6d ) ] ) can easily be computed from equation ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "all these equations hold equally well for the limiting cases . in the absence of intra - channel interactions ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 . for very strong repulsions ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 which is same as for the motion of non - interacting dimers on the lattice @xcite . under very large attractive strength ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , which seems to be justified , as in this case the whole system is expected to be fully occupied without any vacancies .",
    "we are now in a position to compute important steady state properties such as density profiles , particle current and correlations present in the system . according to the system dynamics , there are total eight configurations in the bulk that participate in the computation of particle current ( flux ) per channel as illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "each of these configuration consists of four consecutive one - site vertical cluster . in all these cases ,",
    "the current is measured only when there is particle movement from upper site of second vertical cluster to the upper site of third vertical cluster .",
    "the movement depends upon the occupancy of lower site of second vertical cluster and occupancy state of first and fourth vertical cluster .",

    "in order to examine the effect of attractive as well as repulsive interactions on the collective dynamics of motor proteins working on two - channel coupled system and to test the applicability of the proposed approximate theoretical framework , we plot phase diagrams obtained theoretically as well as by monte - carlo simulations in figure [ fig4 ] , for different repulsive and attractive strength of interactions under a fixed coupling rate @xmath14 = 0.2 . it is worth to mention here that as our generalized approach agrees with the known vertical cluster mean field approach for the case of no interactions , the theoretical and simulation results for the phase diagram obtained in this case matches exactly .    on comparing the phase diagrams for different interaction strength and splitting parameter ( figure [ fig4 ] ) ,",
    "it is evident that theoretical results agree quite well with the simulation results for both relatively weak attractive and repulsive interaction . for stronger interactions ,",
    "the theoretical and simulation results agrees mostly at qualitative level . additionally , for a fixed coupling strength , the ld - mc and ld - hd phase transition line shifts rightwards and downwards , respectively , with the increase in the strength of repulsive interactions which further causes the enlargement of ld region in the phase plane .",
    "while for attractive interaction , ld ( hd ) phase shrinks ( enlarges ) due to the movement of ld - mc and hd - mc line towards left and up , respectively .",
    "the reason behind such behavior is understood as follows : repulsive interaction reduces the effective entrance rate of the system as well as drive the particles away from each other which opposes the existence of large particle cluster .",
    "both the situations favors the ld phase .",
    "while attractions increase the effective entrance rate and decrease the exit rate which causes particles to form larger bond inside the lattice leading to high density .    in an interactive coupled tasep system",
    ", it is also important to discuss the effect of coupling rate on the phase diagram .",
    "each curve in figure [ fig5 ] is traced by the position of the triple point corresponding to various coupling rate under a given interaction strength splitted symmetrically between @xmath26 and @xmath22 .",
    "note that the generalized theory correctly predicts the triple points for the special case of no - interactions as simulation results coincides with the theoretical predictions ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "for relatively weak attractive interactions , the triple points predicted from the theoretical approximation are in agreement with the simulation results , while for weak repulsive interactions , the location of the triple point agrees well only for relatively weak coupling @xmath184 .",

    "this is true , as when a particle feels obstruction in its own lane , it switches to other lane ( with rate @xmath14 ) and thus diminishes the risk of traffic jam of particles and allows the smooth flow of particles . to observe the effect for a range of interactions on maximal current of particles and also to validate whether the proposed theory overcomes the drawback of mft in producing infinite bulk current for attractive interactions , particle flux in mc phase",

    "also , particle flux behavior is not symmetric about @xmath186 .",
    "note that for @xmath187 , the maximal current vanishes for any value of @xmath41 .    from the theoretical development and simulation results one can see that as moving from very large repulsive to attractive interaction maximal particle current shows a non - monotonous behavior for all values of splitting parameter except for @xmath185 .",
    "it is rather a uni - modal function , which firstly increases from a saturated positive value to its maximum with increments in @xmath11 , then decreases rapidly , ultimately diminishing to zero as @xmath188 for any rate splitting parameter @xmath189 ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , it is found that the optimal value of the interaction energy for which the maximum flux is obtained does not correspond to the case of no interactions .",
    "rather it occurs for weak repulsive interactions for any value of splitting parameter .",
    "to further investigate the coupling effect on the multi - particle interactive dynamics , the path traced by the points representing optimal interaction strength and its corresponding weak repulsive strength @xmath14 is plotted as a function of coupling rate in the phase plane @xmath190 for different @xmath41 ( figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that whatever be the coupling rate , the optimal interaction strength corresponding to maximal current of particles ( @xmath191 ) always occurs for weak repulsive interactions .",
    "moreover , the optimal maximal current and interation strength obtained from simulation results agree quite well with the theoretical values for all splitting values other than @xmath41 = 1 . it is also observed that the optimal current value decreases with an increase in the coupling strength for any value of @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , it can be viewed from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) that for repulsive interactions , breaking of cluster is strongly affected by interactions for smaller value of @xmath41 . from figure [ fig7 ] , one can see that particle dynamics differ for small and large values of @xmath41 .",
    "the larger value of optimal current is observed for smaller @xmath41 which corresponds to more strong repulsive interaction for any @xmath14 . as @xmath41 increases and @xmath192 , the optimal maximal current decreases for any value of coupling rate @xmath14 ( figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "as seen in our previous discussion that interactions of molecular motor in a coupled system significantly affect the particle dynamics , we now study the correlations to further investigate the dynamical properties of the system at stationary state .",

    "this is corresponding to the case of attractive interaction , where particle always form large clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the function @xmath201 takes negative value , for the case when presence of particle at @xmath6 vertical cluster reduces the chance to have particle at its neighboring vertical cluster .",
    "this occurs for the case of repulsive interaction , when particles get repel from each other and there is less probability of finding two fully filled cluster together .",
    "our theoretical expression for correlation function is in accordance with these physical considerations .    for @xmath49 i.e. the case of repulsive interaction , @xmath201 yields negative values and approaches to @xmath202 for very large repulsive interactions ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "for attractive interaction i.e. when @xmath44 , correlations are always positive and for a particular case of infinite attractions ( @xmath136 ) , @xmath201 tends to extreme positive value @xmath203 .",
    "this positive and large value indicates the highest probability of getting two fully filled vertical clusters together . additionally , when the occupancy of particles in two consecutive vertical cluster is independent , @xmath201 approaches zero .",
    "this occurs for @xmath80 , which corresponds to @xmath204 in our system .",
    "it is worth to mention that effect of inter - channel interactions has appeared in @xmath201 through its naturally inheritance in @xmath53 .    in figure",
    "[ fig8 ] , the correlation function obtained analytically as well as through simulations is plotted as a function of interaction energy @xmath11 for various value of splitting parameter @xmath41 for a fixed coupling rate @xmath205 .",
    "note that , we plot all correlation curves with respect to interaction energy @xmath11 instead of parameter @xmath70 for simplicity in comparing the previous results with the new ones .",
    "it is clear from the figure that for the case of repulsive interaction as well as weak attractive interaction , there is good consistency found between both theoretical and simulation findings and results matches qualitatively for relatively stronger attractive attractions .",
    "the reason for this agreement is due to the consideration of two neighboring vertical cluster in our theoretical approximation . in case of repulsion",
    ", particles generally form smaller cluster where the particle inside the cluster influences locally , the correlations encountered are short - range and weak . on the contrary ,",
    "correlations are stronger and long - range in the case of attractive interactions . in this case",
    ", particles at @xmath6 vertical cluster will attract the particle at @xmath200 vertical cluster which further increases the tendency of its right neighbor vertical cluster to be fully occupied , thus the particles form large clusters , whose combined effect can not be justified by our approximation theory .",
    "we have computed correlation curves for a fixed coupling strength @xmath205 as for other coupling strengths , the difference in correlation function curves is very minute and can be neglected within a relative error of @xmath206    since the collectively working motor proteins interact with each other and switch in the presence of other filaments , it is interesting to relate our theoretical predictions that take these realistic effect in terms of inter and intra channel interactions , with the known experimental results on collective behavior of kinesin motor protein .",
    "experimentally , it is known that kinesins experience short - range interaction of range @xmath207 @xcite .",
    "the recent theoretical and numerical study on interactive single channel tasep model @xcite , that takes only symmetric splitting of interaction , argues the optimal interactive strength corresponding to the maximal current of particles ( @xmath208 to be @xmath209 .",
    "this repulsive interaction strength is in opposite regime to the experimentally known interaction strength for robust functioning of motor proteins .",
    "later on , a refined theoretical study on interactive single channel tasep @xcite which takes into account correlations and role of symmetry of interaction , claims the occurrence of @xmath191 in the range @xmath210(0.4 - 1.5)@xmath211 for most of the interaction splittings .",
    "the simulation results for @xmath212 imply that kinesin flux might be optimized for weak attractive strength .",
    "this indicates that for the specific value of microscopic parameter @xmath41 , the interactive strength predicted experimentally might corresponds for both robust and maximal flow of particles . the optimal interaction strength , @xmath191 , computed theoretically by this method for a single channel tasep is also highlighted by a circle in figure [ fig7 ] for different values of splitting parameter .",
    "however , all discussed theories were limited to one channel .",
    "they did nt consider the realistic feature of inter - channel transitions , which affects the collective dynamics of motor proteins .",
    "the optimal interaction energy for the maximal current of particles @xmath213 , under different rate of coupling between the lanes is shown in figure [ fig7 ] for different interaction splittings .",
    "the analysis from our new results presented in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] suggest that the possibility for the particle to change lane might shifts the optimal interaction energy @xmath213 towards the experimentally found interactive strength of particles not only for @xmath212 but also for other splitting interactions , which is a result of great importance . since in our model , we have incorporated only inter and intra channel effects , it is expected that if further more realistic features of motor proteins such as their motion in a complex network , presence of three or more lanes , interaction with the open environment , backward stepping of motor proteins etc are considered , it might happen that kinesins working under the interaction energy @xmath214 supports maximal current as well . the results in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] also indicates that in - spite of taking the effect of coupling in between the lanes , the small changes in interaction energy may lead to large changes in particle collective behavior , which has been found experimentally important for maintaining robust cellular transport @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have developed a new generalized approach called modified vertical cluster mean field theory , to investigate the collective dynamics of interacting molecular motors that move along two parallel cytoskeletal filaments .",
    "the interactions , predicted experimentally , are incorporated in a two - channel symmetrically coupled original tasep model by modifying its transition rates via fundamental thermodynamic arguments .",
    "it was observed that interactions bring correlations into the system , which can not be ignored .",
    "this causes the probability for any one - site vertical cluster to depend upon the occupancy of its neighboring cluster .",
    "our theory is based on approximating the probabilities of two neighboring one - site vertical clusters .",
    "the approach successfully predicts the correlations for repulsive and weak attractive interactions that bring short - range correlations , while it qualitatively predicts long - range correlation generated in case of stronger attractive interactions .",
    "the effect of inter - channel coupling on triple points is found to be symmetric for weak repulsive and attractive interactions .",
    "the effect of different coupling strength and symmetry of interactions are observed on the optimal interaction strength ( @xmath191 ) and its corresponding maximal particle current .",
    "when breaking of bond is strongly affected by the interactions , ( i.e. @xmath41 is smaller ) , the optimal maximal current is achieved for repulsive interaction .",
    "as the coupling in between the two channels becomes stronger , the repulsive interactive strength becomes weaker and the optimal maximal current decreases .",
    "however , when the breaking of bond is weakly influenced ( i.e. @xmath41 is larger ) , an increment in the coupling rate decreases the maximal current but the optimal interactive strength @xmath191 remains the same .",
    "the coupling in between both the channels decreases the magnitude of correlations into the system as compared to the case of one - channel interacting tasep system .",
    "however , increasing the coupling effect does nt significantly change the strength of correlations .",
    "all results predicted from the proposed theory are matched with extensive monte - carlo simulations .    from the implication of our results for kinesin motor proteins ,",
    "we conclude that implementing more realistic features of motor proteins such as interactions with more than one - channel and open - environment at all sites of a channel , limited number of motor proteins at the surroundings , back movement of motor proteins , etc gives more justification to the experimental expectations on kinesins",
