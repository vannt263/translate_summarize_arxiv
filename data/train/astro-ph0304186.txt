    "many of the expected high - energy sources are variable , like blazars which emit signals that often appear to vary chaotically with time .    does such signal result from the superposition of many random events ( randomly generated shocks in outflowing gas ; randomly appearing reconnections of magnetic field lines ; etc . ) ? or they are governed by some global physical mechanism described by non - linear differential equations , which shows deterministic chaos ( coherent variability of clouds of electrons ; instability of a shock at the base of the jet forming region ; etc . ) ?",
    "finally , is it possible to find same kind of periodicity , at least in particular intervals of time ( hot spots in the rotating accretion disk ; helicoidal movements of the jet ; etc . ) ?    for a reasonable answer to these questions , we can use - for example - one or more of the following statistical analysis :    * _ correlation , autocorrelation , power spectrum estimation , with fft : _ future high energy missions working in scanning mode ( like glast ) probably will provide data well sampled at evenly spaced intervals , that can be processed with the fourier transforms ; * _ correlation , autocorrelation , power spectrum estimation , with the lomb - scargle periodogram _ ,",
    "( lomb 1976 , scargle 1982 ) for irregularly or incompletely sampled data ; * _ correlation and autocorrelation with the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) _ described by edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) , useful for unevenly spaced data ; * _ first order structure function ( sf ) _ , because there is a simple correspondence between power laws in the frequency space fourier analysis , and the sf analysis in the time domain ( see , e.g. , hufnagel & bregman ( 1992 ) ; * _ detrended fluctuation analysis _",
    ", that permits the detection of intrinsic self - similarity embedded in a seemingly nonstationary time series ( see , e.g. , peng et al .",
    "1995 ) ; * _ the wavelet methods _ , that together with principal component analysis and filtering can be used to extract the `` deterministic '' components from the time - series ( see , e.g. , liszka & holmstrm 1999 ) ; * _ a search for chaotic behavior _ : the most popular measure of an attractor s dimension is the correlation dimension , first defined by grassberger & procaccia ( 1983 ) .",
    "we are using these and other less - known statistical techniques with the bvr@xmath0i@xmath0 database of the automatic imaging telescope at the perugia astronomical observatory ( tosti et al .",
    "preliminary results have been already described in fiorucci et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) , and suggest that the observed variability is truly stochastic and is not caused by deterministic chaos . moreover , many of these statistical descriptors lead to the provisional conclusion that variability of blazars is self - similar on time - scales from a few days up to some years , and it is characterized by power - law power spectrum @xmath1 , where the spectral slope @xmath2 is in the range @xmath3 , with an average value @xmath4 ( see fig.1 ) . to provide a frame of reference , it is convenient to consider two well known cases : white noise has @xmath5 and brownian motion has @xmath6 .",
    "the point is that this kind of variability is observed in all the agn class ( see , e.g , the results of webb & malkan 2000 ) , and it does not seem to be exclusive of the optical wavelengths : _ agns seem to be characterised by variability similar to pink ( or red ) noise in a large range of frequencies_. the x - ray light curves have power spectra with slopes in the range @xmath7 to @xmath8 , ( see , e.g. , lawrance & papadakis 1993 ) .",
    "radio light curves have power spectra with slopes around @xmath8 in time - scales from days up to some years ( see , e.g. , hufnagel & bregman 1992 , lainela & valtaoja 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , we expect to see a similar behavior at higher energies too , because in the majority of theoretical models for agns there is a strictly correlation between @xmath9-ray photons and low - frequency ones .",
    "if this scenario will be confirmed also with future observations , then the problem will be to identify the real time - scales and to understand the physical reasons behind this kind of variability . for the moment",
    ", we can try to use this observational evidence to improve our techniques in the research of this class of objects during all - sky surveys .",
    "egret detected 271 point sources ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , but only 101 of them were identified and , of them , 93 are agns .",
    "the next generation gamma - ray instruments probably will increase this number to many thousands , but it is often crucial to discriminate faint variable sources against the background noise .    for this kind of problem it is generally used the likelihood analysis ( mattox et al . , 1996 ) , that take into account the spatial and energetic distributions of the data .",
    "together with the more traditional techniques developed for a correct discovery and identification of high - energy point sources , we believe that it would be useful to use also the variability tools , for a correct inclusion of the time domain yet during the first elaboration .",
    "in fact many astronomical sources ( as agns , black hole x - ray binary systems , and also gamma ray bursts ) show variability characterised as _ red - noise _ in a large scale of frequencies .",
    "for example , fig.2 shows the application of a traditional technique ( the wiener filter , see press et al .",
    "1992 ) for the `` identification '' of a simulated variable source with the assumption that the power spectrum has a @xmath10 behavior added to a white noise tail . with the original simulated signal",
    "it is quite difficult to verify the presence of a variable source respect to the background noise ( assumed as white noise ) , because the fluctuation is within the limit of three standard deviations .",
    "the filtered signal puts in evidence the presence of a `` possible '' point source , characterized by _ red - noise _ variability .",
    "all the above mentioned statistical methods can be very useful for a rough estimation of the physical phenomena , but unfortunately they are not conclusive because the results are always strongly affected by many external factors . for example , the structure function seems to show a strong dependence from the more intense flares , while the discrete correlation function and the detrended fluctuation analysis are influenced by the large gaps in the light curves .",
    "moreover , it is not clear if the _ red - noise _ behavior is a typical feature of agns at the gamma - rays frequencies too , and what is the statistical behavior of the background noise for the next generation high - energy detectors .    for all this reasons we are developing a monte carlo technique to test all the more useful statistical descriptors , and to produce a reliable quantification of the results so obtained .",
    "in the same time , we intend to develop a neural network technique that can be used to analyse the time series , to find the embedding dimension of the characteristic attractor , and to perform well the frequency extraction in unevenly sampled signals .",
    "finally , we are developing a light simulator for the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard of the glast satellite , with the aim to test the possible use of variability tools to discover and identify @xmath9-rays point sources .",
