    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are interacting binaries containing a low mass donor star transferring matter onto a neutron star ( ns ) or black hole .",
    "mass accretion takes place through an accretion disc , and with temperatures approaching @xmath2 k , such systems are strong x - ray sources . the mass transfer rate supplied by the donor star , @xmath3 ,",
    "is driven by the binary / donor evolution and for @xmath4 results in persistently bright x - ray sources . in these binaries",
    "optical emission is dominated by reprocessing of the powerful x - ray luminosity in the gas around the compact object which usually swamp the spectroscopic features of the weak companions stars . only in exceptional cases , such as long - period lmxbs with much brighter evolved donors ( e. g. cyg x-2 )",
    "is a complete orbital solution possible ( @xcite ; hereafter cck98 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "dynamical studies have classically been restricted to the analysis of x - ray transients during quiescence , where the intrinsic luminosity of the donor dominates the light spectrum of the binary ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , this situation has recently changed thanks to the discovery of the narrow emission components arising from the donor star in the prototypical persistent lmxb sco x-1 @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy revealed many narrow high - excitation emission lines , the most prominent associated with heii @xmath5 and niii @xmath64634 - 41 / ciii @xmath64647 - 50 at the core of the broad bowen blend . in particular , the niii lines are powered by fluorescence resonance through cascade recombination which initially requires euv seed photons of heii ly@xmath7 .",
    "these very narrow ( fwhm @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) components move in antiphase with respect to the wings of heii @xmath104686 , which approximately trace the motion of the compact star . both properties ( narrowness and phase offset ) imply that these components originate in the irradiated face of the donor star .",
    "this work represented the first detection of the companion star in sco x-1 and opened a new window for extracting dynamical information and thereby deriving mass functions in a population of @xmath11 20 lmxbs with established optical counterparts .",
    "we now know that this property is not peculiar to sco x-1 but is a feature of persistent lmxbs , as demonstrated by the following examples : + ( i )  doppler tomography of niii @xmath12 in the eclipsing adc ( _ accretion disc corona _ ) pulsar 2a 1822 - 371 reveals a compact spot at the position of the companion star and with velocity @xmath13 km s@xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the application of the k - correction to this @xmath14 velocity , combined with other system parameters , strongly points to the presence of a neutron star with mass @xmath15 in this system  ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ ( ii )  radial velocities of narrow bowen lines in the black hole candidate gx339 - 4 , detected during the 2002 outburst , led to a mass function in excess of @xmath16 , and hence provided the first dynamical proof that the compact object is indeed a black hole(@xcite ) .",
    "+ ( iii )  sharp niii @xmath104640 bowen emission has been detected in 4u 1636 - 536 , 4u 1735 - 444 ( @xcite ) , aql x-1 ( @xcite ) and the transient millisecond pulsar xte j1814 - 338(@xcite ) , which lead to donor velocity semi - amplitudes in the range 200 - 300 km s@xmath9 .",
    "echo - tomography is an indirect imaging technique which uses time delays between x - ray and uv / optical light - curves as a function of orbital phase in order to map the reprocessing sites in a binary ( @xcite ; hereafter ob02 )",
    ". the optical light curve can be simulated by the convolution of the ( source ) x - ray light curve with a transfer function which encodes information about the geometry and visibility of the reprocessing regions .",
    "the transfer function  ( tf ) quantifies the binary response to the irradiated flux as a function of the lag time and it is expected to have two main components : the accretion disc and the donor star .",
    "the latter is strongly dependent on the inclination angle , binary separation and mass ratio and , therefore , can be used to set tight constraints on these fundamental parameters .",
    "successful echo - tomography experiments have been performed on several x - ray active lmxbs using x - ray and broad - band uv / optical light - curves .",
    "the results indicate that the reprocessed flux is dominated by the large contribution of the accretion disc ( e.g. @xcite;hereafter h98 , ob02 , @xcite and @xcite ) which dilutes the reprocessed signal arising from the companion . only @xcite and @xcite have reported the detection of reprocessed pulsations in the x - ray binaries 4u 1626 - 67 and her x-1 respectively .",
    "they only used optical data but the doppler phase modulation of the coherent pulses leads to reprocessing of the x - ray pulses on the companion star .",
    "more recently , @xcite have reported some evidence for a reprocessed signal from the companion through the detection of orbital phase dependent echoes in exo 0748 - 676 .",
    "+ exploiting emission - line reprocessing rather than broad - band photometry has two potential benefits : a ) it amplifies the response of the donor s contribution by suppressing most of the background continuum light ( which is associated with the disc ) ; b ) since the lines are formed in an optically thin medium , the reprocessing time is almost instantaneous and hence the response is sharper ( i.e. only smeared by geometry ) and the transfer function easier to compute ( see @xcite ; hereafter md05 ) .",
    "taking advantage of this , we decided to undertake an echo - tomography campaign on the brightest lmxb of all , sco x-1 , in order to search for reprocessed signatures of the donor using simultaneous x - ray and bowen / heii emission line light - curves .",
    "+      sco x-1 is the prototype lmxb and also the brightest persistent x - ray source in the sky and has been the target of detailed studies since its discovery ( @xcite ) .",
    "an orbital period of 18.9 hr was reported by @xcite from photographic photometry of the v@xmath1113 optical counterpart , v818 sco , using plates spanning over 85 years .",
    "the optical b - band light curve shows a 0.13 mag amplitude modulation ( @xcite ) , which is interpreted as due to the changing visibility of the inner - hemisphere of the x - ray heated companion .",
    "radial velocity curves of heii@xmath104686 and hi confirmed the orbital period and indicated that the inferior conjunction of the emission line regions are close to the photometric minimum and , hence , they must originate near the compact object ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite measured the trigonometric parallax of sco x-1 using vlba radio observations and deduced a distance of @xmath17 kpc .",
    "further observations revealed the presence of twin radio lobes , which are inclined at an angle of @xmath18 relative to the line of sight ( @xcite ; hereafter f01 ) .",
    "furthermore , sco x-1 is classed as a @xmath19 due to the z - shape patterns that the spectral variations trace in the x - ray hard / soft colour - colour diagram .",
    "the source also exhibits khz qpos ( @xcite ) but no x - ray bursts have been observed so far .",
    "+ possible correlated optical and x - ray variability has been studied by using broad band observations in both spectral ranges . in particular , @xcite and @xcite present evidence for correlated variability during flaring episodes .",
    "they measured time - lags consistent with reprocessing in the accretion disc . here",
    "we present the first detection of delayed echoes arising from the companion star in sco x-1 together with other echoes more consistent with reprocessing in the accretion disc .",
    "the echoes are found during different x - ray states within the z - shape pattern .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for reprocessing theory and the system parameters of sco x-1 .    .sco",
    "x-1 optical observing log [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although the fit is poor we obtain @xmath20s for the @xmath21 band which is consistent with the icf analysis . on the other hand , we get @xmath22s and @xmath23 for the @xmath21 and continuum bands respectively .",
    "these values are larger than those obtained for w3 and this is probably due to the presence of features in the x - ray data which are not present in the optical light - curves ( see section 5 . ) .",
    "we also obtain @xmath24s for b+heii and this is consistent with the results for w3 within the errors .",
    "figure [ c_g_b8 ] shows the fits of the convolved x - ray light - curves overplotted on the optical data .",
    "although there are small features which are not correlated , the fit successfully reproduces the main behaviour of the optical data",

    "the light - curves have been smoothed for clarity.,width=302 ]",
    "the broad band x - ray spectral variations of z - sources are usually studied by building colour - colour diagrams ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have used the pca energy bands @xmath28(@xmath29-@xmath30 kev ) , @xmath31(@xmath30-@xmath32 kev ) and @xmath33(@xmath32-@xmath34 kev ) in order to compute the hard(@xmath35 ) and soft(@xmath36 ) x - ray colours . the colour - colour diagram obtained from the data of the whole campaign",
    "is presented in the upper panel of figure [ coco ] .",
    "sco x-1 was at the bottom of the normal branch ( nb ) during most of the 17 may data but moved towards the flaring branch ( fb ) in the last rxte visit , showing a 50 percent increase in flux . on 18",
    "may sco x-1 was in the fb and exhibited large amplitude variability , with large flares similar to those seen during w3",
    ". on 19 may the system stayed on the nb again .",
    "as we showed in the light curve analysis , we have only detected correlated variability during the second night when the system moved across the fb . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ coco ] we present the colour - colour diagram for the night of 18 may and separate the w3 and w5 data using different symbols .",
    "we have also marked the intervals within these windows where the icf analysis has been performed .",
    "it is clear that the icf peak obtained during w3 is associated with the hardest x - ray emission , whereas during w5 ( where lower delays are detected for the b+heii emission ) the system was close to the transition between the fb and nb .",
    "this study suggests that reprocessing associated with the companion star is most easily detected when the x - ray flux is at maximum and the spectra are harder .",
    "note that although the spectra is harder in w3 , the flux corresponding to both the soft and hard x - ray emission components is at maximum during this window .",
    "we have found clear evidence for optical echoes to the x - ray emission when sco x-1 is moving across the fb .",
    "we have detected two different delay time scales by using both the low and high frequency variations present in the both x - ray and optical data .",
    "the low frequency analysis results in large delays of @xmath37s which are clearly not consistent with the rts expected for sco x-1 if we only assume light - travel times .",
    "such large delays have been previously seen by other authors . in particular",
    "a @xmath38s delay was reported by i80 in sco x-1 .",
    "@xcite studied the local diffusion time - scale during x - ray reprocessing .",
    "they found that 50% of the x - ray photons are reemitted within the first @xmath39s , although a long tail of delays up to 10s is found as well .",
    "since the light travel times within sco x-1 should be lower than 15 - 18s , it is clear that the time - lags obtained for the low frequency variability are not compatible with x - ray reprocessing on any possible site within the binary .",
    "although the nature of these long time - lags is unclear we note that they are marginally consistent with the time scale for re - adjustment to thermal equilibrium in the accretion disc , which is expected to be about a few minutes ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , the higher frequency variability component yields shorter delays ( @xmath40s ) which are indeed consistent with x - ray reprocessing within the binary .",
    "in particular , during w3 we have found that the sdss u band , the b+heii emission and the continuum data lag the x - ray emission with light travel times of @xmath41s , @xmath42s and @xmath41s respectively . in order to measure these delays",
    "we have used both icf and tf methods finding excellent agreement between the two techniques .",
    "the case of the b+heii emission is especially interesting since sc02 demonstrated that it is partially associated with emission arising from the companion star in sco x-1 .",
    "this emission is produced by fluorescence resonance through cascade recombination of heii ly@xmath7 photons in a low density medium , and hence we expect almost instantaneous reprocessing times . fig .",
    "[ dvq ] shows the range of expected time - delays for both the companion and the accretion disc as a function of the mass ratio ( @xmath43 ) . in this simulation",
    "we have considered the tf presented in md05 for the standard orbital parameters  ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) of sco x-1 and @xmath46 .",
    "the time - lags of @xmath47s obtained for the b+heii ( unsubtracted ) data during w3 lies at the lower edge of the companion region , and shows that part of this emission must arise from reprocessing on the donor star .",
    "hence , this time - delay represents the first direct detection of delayed echoes from the companion star .",
    "+ in an attempt to isolate the emission from the b+heii lines we subtracted the continuum data from the green channel and we have applied both the icf and tf techniques to the obtained light - curve . by using the tf technique we obtain a time - lag of @xmath48s which is perfectly accommodated in the companion region ( fig .",
    "[ dvq ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the icf method yields a time - lag between @xmath49s ( see table [ cfac ] ) . according to the tfs computed in md05",
    ", this time - lag is larger than expected for the maximum response of the companion for each value of @xmath50 ( white dashed line ) . here",
    ", we have assumed a disc flaring angle of @xmath51 but the discrepancy is still present if we use larger @xmath52 values .",
    "this suggests that some of the values used for the orbital parameters of sco x-1 might not be correct .",
    "furthermore , if we consider that the disc extends up to the truncation radius computed in @xcite we find that the time - delay of @xmath41s obtained for the continuum is also slightly larger than expected for the outer disc .",
    "but this difference could be reconciled if the continuum light were a combination of both reprocessed emission from the companion and the accretion disc .",
    "this is supported by the orbital modulation seen in the optical light - curve , which is associated with heating of the companion ( e. g. sc02 ) .",
    "however this is in contradiction with the @xmath41s lag also measured for this filter during w5 .",
    "since w5 is centered at @xmath53 the delay associated with reprocessing on the companion must be lower than for w3  ( @xmath46 ) , and hence the measured time - lag should also be lower .",
    "we propose two possible scenarios in order to better accommodate our measured icf time - delays with the model computed for fig .",
    "[ dvq ] : +    , @xmath45 and the orbital parameters of sco x-1 .",
    "the black region shows the @xmath25 delays obtained for the b+heii , and continuum data .",
    "the shadowed region represents the range of delays obtained by subtracting the continuum from the b+heii light - curve .",
    "the white dashed line is the highest probability delay for the companion according to md05 and using @xmath51.,width=302 ]    \\(i ) the inclination angle of the system is @xmath54 , significantly higher than the @xmath55 reported by f01 .",
    "this latter result was obtained by assuming that the jets are perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary .",
    "this assumption is difficult to test but there is evidence for misalignments in some x - ray binaries ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) the neutron star ( ns ) has a mass of @xmath56 .",
    "note that there are evidents of heavier  ( @xmath57 ) neutron stars in some lmxbs ( e. g. cyg x-2 ; cck98 , v395 car ; @xcite , @xcite or x1822 - 371;mcm05 )    obviously , a combination of the two scenarios can also solve the discrepancy i.e. @xmath58 and ns mass @xmath59 .",
    "we stress that this interpretation relies on the result derived through the continuum subtraction analysis for the icf method .",
    "alternatively , we obtain a more conservative result by using the tf method which results in time lags consistent with the standard parameters of sco x-1 . + the @xmath41s delay obtained for the sdss @xmath21 band during w3 is much larger than measured during w5  ( @xmath60s ) .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour of the b+heii emission where a @xmath42s lag was measured during w3 and @xmath61s during w5 , but different to the continuum filter , where a @xmath41s delay is observed both in w3 and w5 . sc02",
    "have detected narrow components within the bowen blend which arise from the companion star and also have reported the presence of many other high ionization lines at @xmath62 in the spectrum of sco x-1 .",
    "they showed that at least one of these emission lines also arises from the companion star . according to the uv spectra of sco x-1 presented in s89",
    "there are many high excitation lines within the spectral range covered by the sdss @xmath21 band .",
    "in particular , this range covers three bowen oiii lines at @xmath63 , which probably also arise from the companion .",
    "the contribution of these lines to the @xmath21 band light could explain the larger time - delays obtained for this band during w3 .",
    "+ @xcite pointed out that the intensity of the high excitation emission lines present in the uv spectrum ( @xmath64 ) of sco x-1 increases by a factor 1.5 - 3.2 when the source moves towards a high uv state .",
    "these authors associated this high uv state with a high energy x - ray state by using simultaneous uv / x - ray data ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "based on this study we propose that while sco x-1 stays at the bottom of the fb ( w5 ) the intensity of the high excitation lines is not large enough to dominate over the continuum signal which arises from the accretion disc . and we note that the distribution of time - lags is correlated with wavelength for w5 .",
    "this is consistent with a scenario where optical emission arises through reprocessing in an accretion disc with a radial temperature profile .",
    "moreover , when we subtract the continuum from the b+heii data in w5 the delays do not shift to higher values .",
    "this shows that the b+heii emission is dominated by the same signal as the continuum during w5 .",
    "+ on the other hand , w3 is centered at orbital phase @xmath1 when the inner hemisphere of the companion presents its largest visibility with respect to us .",
    "our colour - colour diagram shows that at this time the source was at the top of the fb , which resulted in higher x - ray emission ( factor @xmath65 with respect to w5 ) and a harder x - ray spectrum . according to w80 , during this high energy state",
    "the intensity of the bowen emission lines could have increased enough to dominate over the continuum signal and yielding the echo detection obtained for the w3 b+heii data .",
    "on the other hand , we note that during the first part of w3 the system was also at the top of the fb but no time - lag consistent with the companion was detected .",
    "this shows that there are still some gaps in our knowledge of when and how it is possible to detect the reprocessing signal from the companion .",
    "+ for the case of the continuum subtracted data , where the errors are larger , we find that the accuracy provided by the icf method is much higher than obtained through the tf technique . nevertheless , the latter has proved very useful to determine time - lags and their corresponding uncertainties for the three bands considered .",
    "@xcite applied this technique to the sets of sco x-1 data used by i80 and p81 .",
    "they measured @xmath66s and @xmath67s for the johnson @xmath68 band data .",
    "this filter covers our b+heii narrow band and these results are consistent with ours during w5 .",
    "the tf method also provides information about the time - delay distribution , which is encoded in the parameter @xmath27 . during",
    "w3 we have measured @xmath69s in the three bands whereas it increases after subtracting the continuum from the b+heii emission .",
    "these results are consistent with the time - lag distribution expected for reprocessing within the binary .",
    "although the increase in @xmath27 detected for the b+heii cs data is consistent with the higher time - lag measured for this light - curve , we note that @xmath27 is also sensitive to the presence of uncorrelated features in the x - ray data .",
    "since the tf fitting is based on a gaussian smoothing of the x - ray light - curve , the method tends to remove the non - correlated features by increasing @xmath27 .",
    "this clearly happens in the tf analysis of the sdss @xmath21 band during w5 where uncorrelated features are present .",
    "we , for the first time , have isolated emission line contributions from the mass donor star that respond to x - ray variations with a delay that is consistent with light - travel time bewteen the x - ray source near the neutron star and the irradiated face of the donor star that directly contributes to the emission .",
    "the correlated signal from the companion is found at an orbital phase close to the superior conjunction of the donor , when a large flare occurs and the system stays at the top of the fb . in particular , the b+heii emission is dominated by the reprocessed emission from the companion which increases the time - lag by 25% in comparison to that obtained in a featureless continuum at @xmath70 . after subtracting the continuum emission from the b+heii light - curve",
    "we amplify the signal from the donor and measure time lags in the range 10.5 - 16.5s by using both the tf and icf techniques .",
    "we also note that for the latter case we have detected @xmath71 significant icf peaks centered at 14 - 16s which suggests that either the orbital inclination or the ns mass could be higher than the standard values assumed .",
    "we stress here that a second detection of a b+heii echo from the companion at a different orbital phase would directly constrain the inclination angle of the system . a more detailed study using heii ly@xmath7 and bowen line light - curves",
    "could probably increase the signal from the companion , thereby allowing a more accurate determination of the system parameters in sco x-1 .",

    "<S> we present simultaneous x - ray ( rxte ) and optical ( ultracam ) narrow band ( bowen blend / heii and nearby continuum ) observations of sco x-1 at 2 - 10 hz time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bowen / heii emission lags the x - ray light - curves with a light travel time of @xmath0s which is consistent with reprocessing in the companion star . </S>",
    "<S> the echo from the donor is detected at orbital phase @xmath1 when sco x-1 is at the top of the flaring branch . </S>",
    "<S> evidence of echoes is also seen at the bottom of the flaring branch but with time - lags of 5 - 10 s which are consistent with reprocessing in an accretion disc with a radial temperature profile . </S>",
