    "the discovery , within the past decade , of the presence of multiple stellar populations in galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) has forced a revision of the traditional paradigm for the origin of these objects . for several decades , gc stars have been known to exhibit na , o , al , and mg ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spreads .",
    "more recently , star - to - star variations in chemical - composition were associated with the detection of multiple sequences in high - precision colour - magnitude diagrams for the majority of galactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to the suggestion of a complex history of star formation and chemical enrichment in systems once thought to be prototypical single stellar populations . under most such scenarios , the so - called `` first - generation '' ( fg ) stars exhibit abundance patterns that are similar to those of field stars of the same [ fe / h ] , whereas the chemical compositions of `` second - generation '' ( sg ) stars depart from those patterns , showing enhancement in light elements such as he , n , na , and al , and depletion in c , o , and sometimes mg .",
    "no theoretical models based on the premise that gcs evolve chemically have thus far been able to account for the extant data in detail ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , so other alternatives have been sought ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and those have also been shown to fail @xcite . naively , self - enrichment models seem reasonable , for they frame gcs as low - mass manifestations of processes of star formation and chemical enrichment known to operate in galaxies  a notion that is particularly supported by the detection of mass - chemical composition relations in gcs @xcite . however , to be tenable they must rely on requirements that are not borne out by the data .",
    "chief amongst those is the so called `` mass budget problem '' , according to which , for any assumed initial mass function , the observed mass of freshly produced nucleosynthetic material currently observed in the atmospheres of sg stars requires a much larger number of fg polluters than can be reconciled with the numbers of existing low - mass fg cluster stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically by one or more orders of magnitude .",
    "this assumption has been recently challenged @xcite by the discovery of a large population of stars with enhanced n abundances ( n - rich stars ) in the field of the inner galaxy .",
    "the abundance patterns of these stars resemble those of sg stars in galactic gcs , suggesting that they are the possible leftovers of a large population of early gcs that were entirely destroyed .",
    "interestingly , the maximum ratio between fg and sg stars in the inner galaxy is lower than required by models to solve the mass budget problem ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the lower limit to the mass contained in stars originated in the presumptive destroyed gcs is larger than that of the existing galactic gc system by an order of magnitude .",
    "since the metallicity distribution function of n - rich stars is substantially different from that of the present gc system @xcite , one is led to conclude that the remaining gcs are not simply a scaled - down version of a much larger precursor gc system .",
    "rather , the mass loss by the existing gcs was probably modest , and the gc - like stars found in the field today come from a parental gc population that was mostly destroyed . the latter conclusion , though potentially far reaching , depends crucially on the assumption that n - rich stars are reliable tracers of gc populations at all metallicities  in other words , that sg stars in metal - rich gcs present the same levels of enrichment / depletion in light elements as their more metal - poor counterparts .    progress in this field depends crucially on the mapping of the multiple - population phenomenon across the entire volume of parameter space covered by gcs , with metallicity being a particularly important parameter .",
    "painstaking observational efforts have yielded a large collection of colour - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and detailed abundance patterns of gc members ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the metal - rich end , however , elemental abundances are not available for large samples of gc members , because most metal - rich gcs are located in the inner galaxy , which is difficult to access in the optical due to large dust extinction . to our knowledge , only a very small number of metal - rich gcs have been studied with sufficiently large member samples to enable the detection of multiple stellar populations , although low - resolution spectroscopy of stellar members ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and integrated spectroscopy of extragalactic gcs @xcite suggests that they are present .",
    "it is important to document the presence of multiple populations in metal - rich gcs for additional reasons .",
    "firstly , multiple populations provide critical tests of stellar - evolution model predictions for yields of light elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a regime that is important not only for the debate over globular cluster formation , but also in the context of models for the chemical evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "secondly , an estimate of the total mass contained in the presumptive dissolved gcs discovered by @xcite in the inner galaxy depends on knowledge of the ratios between fg and sg stars across the entire metallicity range .",
    "thirdly , there is evidence for the existence of a positive correlation between the amplitude of abundance spreads in gcs and their masses and metallicities , resulting from analysis of the abundances of na and o in individual galactic gc stars @xcite and , in an indirect way , from the mean n abundances of m31 gcs @xcite .",
    "one would thus expect to find similar abundance spreads in metal - rich galactic gcs of moderate - to - high masses .",
    "high - resolution near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy for large samples of stars is probably the most efficient way to attack this problem .",
    "the _ apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment _",
    "( apogee , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contributes importantly in that regard .",
    "a massive survey of galactic stellar populations , apogee obtained h - band @xmath0 resolution spectra for over 150,000 stars , many of which are members of globular clusters .",
    "this article reports the abundance patterns of 23 candidate members of five gcs situated within the inner galaxy .",
    "sample and data are described in section  [ data ] , and results are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "a more exhaustive evaluation of membership and an analysis of the detailed abundance patterns of members of one of the gcs in our sample ( ngc  6553 ) are presented in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "for a detailed analysis of apogee abundances for members of gcs outside the inner galaxy , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind targeting gc stars in apogee was twofold : on the one hand , stars that were previously subjected to detailed abundance analysis are useful for reality checks and potentially the calibration of apogee elemental abundances .",
    "on the other hand , there is an obvious interest in expanding the database of gc elemental abundances by targeting stars that are known or probable gc members , but whose chemical compositions are unknown . the range of metallicities of our sample gcs overlaps largely with samples from previous apogee studies @xcite , but does include some of the most metal - rich gcs known in the galaxy ( ngc  6528 and 6553 )",
    ". also targeted is a gc known to host at least three populations with distinct [ fe / h ] ( terzan  5 ) , and two more metal - poor gcs ( ngc  6522 and palomar  6 ) .",
    "the main relevant properties of the target gcs are summarised in table  [ properties ] . for each gc",
    ", lists of candidate members were put together including targets from both categories above , and these lists were fed to a prioritization algorithm that assigned fibers to various targets in each apogee field .",
    "fiber collision poses a major limitation against a dense sampling of gc stars , by preventing the simultaneous observation of targets separated by less than 1 .",
    "however , more stars could be observed from gcs located in fields that were visited multiple times . as a result of these constraints ,",
    "the sampling of the target gcs discussed in this paper is somewhat serendipitous and not evenly distributed , ranging between one candidate member for ngc  6522 and twelve for ngc  6553 .",
    "all targets are giant stars that are likely gc members with stellar parameters within the following range : @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for further details on apogee target selection ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "[ properties ]    max width=    [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the key result presented in this article is summarised in figure  [ fig : abs ] , where data for all the members of the program gcs are displayed in various abundance - ratio planes .",
    "symbol / colour codes are adopted to distinguish data for stars from different gcs , and on each panel the mean error bars are displayed .",
    "overall , the stars from different gcs follow consistent trends in each diagram , exhibiting a clear c - n anti - correlation and also clear na - n and al - n correlations . as commonly seen in other samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is no clear anti - correlation between al and mg abundances , but rather a substantial spread in the abundance of the former and a smaller spread in mg abundances .",
    "a bimodality is clearly seen in [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] but it is not present in other elemental abundances .",
    "the n - c bimodality is mostly driven by the data for ngc  6553 for which our sample is largest .",
    "there is a clear spread in the abundances of al , na , and mg , but no clear sign of a bimodal distribution can be distinguished for these elements . to decide whether this difference in behaviour between different elemental abundances is due to sample size , larger errors in the abundances of the latter elements , or a real physical effect",
    ", a larger sample will be required .",
    "it is instructive to contrast the data for inner galaxy gcs with those for gcs in the outer galaxy .",
    "the grey circles in figure  [ fig : abs ] indicate the dr12 data for the halo / thick - disk gcs used by @xcite , which are on average more metal - poor than the sample discussed in this paper .",
    "the gcs represented by grey symbols are m  3 ( [ fe / h]=1.5 ) , m  5 ( [ fe / h]=1.3 ) , m  107 ( [ fe / h]=1.0 ) , m  71 ( [ fe / h]=0.8 ) , and ngc  6760 ( [ fe / h]=0.4 ) . overall , the two sets of gcs occupy the same loci in the various chemical - composition planes which is reassuring .",
    "but some differences are noteworthy . in the c - n plane",
    ", there is a large collection of metal - poor gcs at [ c / fe]@xmath30.2 and [ n / fe]@xmath4 + 0.5 .",
    "this is due to the presence of a large population of fg stars from m  3 and m  5 , which have lower [ c / fe ] and slightly higher [ n / fe ] than their counterparts in more metal - rich gcs .",
    "this difference is likely to be the result of the evolution of c and n abundances in the galaxy , a topic that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "regarding [ al / fe ] , there is a hint that the more metal - poor gcs have a larger spread than their metal - rich counterparts , but that difference is barely significant given the size of the errors .",
    "the metal - poor gcs show a possible indication of the presence of a mg - al anti - correlation , as there is a cluster of data with nearly solar [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe]@xmath5 + 0.6 .",
    "those stars all belong to m  3 , so they are fairly metal - poor . interestingly ,",
    "one of the terzan  5 stars in our sample inhabits the same region of the mg - al plane . with [ fe / h]=0.48 , this star is ten times more metal - rich than m  3 members , suggesting that the same process leading to the mg - al anti - correlation may be present at high metallicity .",
    "finally , we note that data for [ na / fe ] are not shown for the metal - poor gcs , since that elemental abundance is quite uncertain in apogee dr12 for metal - poor gcs .    , which can not be explained by mixing.,width=340 ]    the abundances of some elements , such as nitrogen and carbon , are known to vary during evolution along the giant branch , both due to the first dredge - up and extra mixing further up that evolutionary sequence .",
    "it is important to distinguish the star - to - star abundance variations reported in figure  [ fig : abs ] from those due to stellar evolution effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : nlog ] shows our sample in the [ n / fe]@xmath6 plane .",
    "stars from all gcs exhibit strong [ n / fe ] differences at near constant @xmath6 , which shows that stars at nearly the same evolutionary stage have vastly different [ n / fe ] abundances , which argues against evolutionary effects .",
    "we conclude that the intra - gc abundance variations reported in figure  [ fig : abs ] are indicative of the presence of multiple populations in our sample gcs .",
    "it is the first time that the presence of spreads in the abundances of light elements has been established for the gcs in our sample , although for at least one of them ( ngc  6528 ) it has been previously suggested by studies based on medium - resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "such data provide valuable constraints on model predictions in a regime where they have not been sufficiently tested . in particular , the presence of large star - to - star abundance variations  especially in the case of al  for high - metallicity gcs challenge model predictions suggesting that the amplitude of star - to - star variations should decrease towards high metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed confrontation between our data and model predictions is beyond the scope of this paper . in the remainder of this section",
    "we briefly discuss the data for each gc separately .",
    "one of the most metal - rich gcs known in the galaxy with [ fe / h]@xmath50.2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc  6553 is moderately massive ( @xmath7 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so one would expect it to host a measurable spread in the abundances of na @xcite and n @xcite .",
    "it is also the gc for which our sample is the largest , so the finding of a large spread in the abundances of n ( @xmath5 1 dex ) , na ( @xmath5 0.5 dex ) , c ( @xmath5 0.5 dex ) , and al ( @xmath5 0.5 dex ) is statistically robust .",
    "interestingly , al abundances in a couple of the n - normal stars are as high as those in their n - rich counterparts . except for the presence of a few outliers that are probable non - members ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no clear spread in the abundances of heavy elements such as fe or ca is detected .",
    "the abundances of n , c , and perhaps na seem to be bimodal , but any firm conclusion should await a substantial increase in sample size . in a separate publication @xcite , a careful evaluation of membership and a quantitative comparison between model predictions and observations",
    "is pursued for the case of ngc  6553 , for which our stellar sample is the largest .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for a more detailed analysis of the apogee data for that cluster .",
    "terzan  5 is a peculiar object .",
    "its colour - magnitude diagram displays two well - separated red horizontal branches @xcite , and it is known to host a very large population of millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "it is one of the few galactic gcs for which a considerable spread in [ fe / h ] and possibly age has been detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite used keck / nirspec , keck / deimos , and vlt / flames spectra to establish the presence of at least three well defined stellar populations in terzan  5 , with [ fe / h]@xmath50.8 , 0.3 , and + 0.2 ( the highest metallicity detected in any galactic gc . interestingly",
    ", @xcite found that the relation between the abundances of fe and the @xmath8 elements mg and o mimics that of the galactic bulge itself .",
    "unlike other massive galactic gcs that show both a spread in fe and light - element abundances ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no spreads and anti - correlations between the abundances of light elements were previously detected in terzan  5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is surprising given its high mass ( @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the high metallicity of some of its stellar populations .",
    "these results led to the suggestion that terzan  5 is the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy , or perhaps even an early fragment of the original bulge formation @xcite .    our sample for terzan  5 consists of only five stars , yet",
    "the data reveal a large spread in light - element abundances , including a strong n - c anti - correlation and equally strong n - na and n - al correlations .",
    "membership uncertainties are obviously a concern in this case .",
    "all five stars fall safely within the metallicity range established by @xcite , although the n - rich sub - sample is particularly metal - poor , especially considering a zero - point correction of 0.2  dex to apogee raw [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the systemic radial velocity of terzan  5 to be 82  km / s , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath1015  km / s .",
    "all but one of our sample stars are situated within 1@xmath11 of terzan  5 s systemic radial velocity .",
    "the exception is the n - rich star 2m17480088 - 2447295 , with @xmath12km / s  which is too low by @xmath52.5km / s to be within 1@xmath11 from the gc systemic rv .",
    "since this star has a very high [ n / fe ] and , at a distance of @xmath51  from the cluster centre , is well within its tidal radius ( @xmath56.7 ) , we deem it a very likely member of terzan  5 .    aspcap results for some of the terzan  5 candidate members merit a more detailed look .",
    "some of the elemental abundances for star 2m17475169 - 2443153 are quite unusual , with [ n / fe]=0.14 , [ mg / fe]=0.22 and [ al / fe]=1 .",
    "visual inspection showed that there is an important mismatch between synthetic and observed spectra at the continuum level through a large fraction of the apogee spectral interval . in those regions , the normalized flux in continuum pixels of the observed",
    "spectrum is higher than unity and higher than their counterparts in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "this mismatch is probably due to a problem in the normalization of the observed spectrum .",
    "such a mismatch is most likely responsible for an underestimate of the n , na , and mg abundances , as lines due to cn ( e.g. , @xmath1315322 , 15332@xmath14 ) and mg ( e.g. , @xmath1315339 , 15959@xmath14 ) are affected by this issue particularly strongly .",
    "interestingly , an acceptable match of the observed spectrum by aspcap is found in regions of known oh ( e.g. , @xmath1316708 , 16719 , 16889@xmath14 ) and co ( e.g. , @xmath1315368 , 15997 , 16189@xmath14 ) lines @xcite .",
    "perhaps most importantly , such a systematic effect on the continuum normalization could also potentially lead to an overestimate of surface gravity , which may impact the values of abundances inferred from molecular lines which are sensitive to @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the aspcap surface gravity for this star ( @xmath15 ) is quite high for such a cool star ( @xmath16=3844k ) , which could be the result of the continuum systematics identified above . without further calculations it is impossible to gauge the impact of this effect on the chemical composition of this star . given the good fit to co and oh lines , the abundance of c is probably reliable , modulo @xmath6 effects . on the other hand , we consider the abundances of n , mg , and na to be questionable .",
    "regarding al , the situation is more complex , as aspcap reports [ al / fe]=1 for 2m17475169 - 2443153 , which we find suspiciously low .",
    "the strengths of all three al lines in the apogee spectrum ( @xmath1316723 , 16755 , and 16767@xmath14 ) are overpredicted by aspcap , suggesting that [ al / fe ] for this star should be even lower . however , comparison of the spectrum of 2m17475169 - 2443153 with those of stars with very similar stellar parameters and cno abundances ( e.g. , 2m06182536 + 3414581 , 2m17493226 - 2309585 , 2m18322950 - 1246417 , and 2m18493324 - 0302028 ) but vastly different [ al / fe ] ( ranging from 0.1 to -0.59 ) showed very similar line strengths , which is surprising .",
    "we do not understand the origin of these issues , so we choose not to consider the abundances of mg , na and al for this star .",
    "we also examined the abundances of star 2m17480576 - 2445000 , particularly due to the fact that aspcap found a very low value for [ na / fe]=0.47 , which is surprising due to its very large [ n / fe]=+0.77 .",
    "inspection of the two na lines in the apogee region suggests that [ na / fe ] for this star is not reliable .",
    "the strongest of the two lines ( @xmath1716393@xmath14 ) is lost to bad pixels , whereas the remaining weaker line ( @xmath1716378@xmath14 ) is severly underestimated by aspcap , despite the fact that the observed continuum is well matched by the best fitting synthetic spectrum . on the other hand , aspcap does an excellent job of matching the cn lines in the spectrum of this star , so that we consider that [ n / fe ] is quite reliable .",
    "we therefore decide to ignore the abundance of na for this star in the remainder of our analysis .",
    "we conclude that there is strong evidence for the presence of an intrinsic spread , as well as correlations and anti - correlations between light - element abundances in terzan  5 .",
    "a more detailed study , based on a larger sample and including additional elemental abundances is in order .      with [ fe / h]@xmath50.2 ,",
    "ngc  6528 is another very metal - rich bulge gc @xcite .",
    "it is also moderately massive ( @xmath18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on medium - resolution spectroscopy of a relatively small sample , @xcite determined the presence of a bimodal distribution of cn band strengths .",
    "in contrast , @xcite obtained strmgren photometry for a larger sample , but did not report the presence of a bimodal distribution in cn - sensitive colour indices .",
    "our sample contains only two ngc  6528 candidate members , with essentially identical atmospheric parameters , but a significantly different n and c , and na abundances suggesting the presence of an abundance spread in this gc as well , in agreement with the result by @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the metallicity of palomar 6 to be [ fe / h]@xmath51 .",
    "the cluster is moderately massive ( @xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore we would expect in this case to detect the presence of multiple populations .",
    "the sample of candidate members is small , and the only element found to present variations that are statistically significant is n. while there are indications that c and al also show variations , they are not significantly larger than the error bars .",
    "the data on na , on the other hand , suggest the presence of variations .",
    "however , at the relatively low metallicity of palomar 6 , na abundances in dr12 are uncertain , due to the weakness of the available lines in the apogee spectrum .",
    "we conclude that a definite variation in [ n / fe ] was detected , but for c , al , and na more data are required to establish the definitive presence of abundance spreads .",
    "an old gc located in the inner galaxy , ngc  6522 is moderately metal poor with [ fe / h]@xmath51 @xcite and has a low mass ( @xmath20 , * ? ? ?",
    "it is thus not immediately clear that ngc  6522 is expected to contain multiple populations .",
    "our sample contains only one candidate member of this gc , which makes any conclusion on the presence of multiple populations by definition very uncertain .",
    "however , the star is likely a member on the grounds of metallicity , radial velocity , and position , and it has a very high nitrogen abundance ( [ n / fe]=+1.04 ) .",
    "moreover , in figure  [ fig : nlog ] one can see that our ngc  6522 sample star occupies the same locus in [ n / fe]@xmath6 space as second generation stars in other gcs .",
    "indeed , at the metallicity of ngc  6522 , only sg stars attain such high nitrogen abundances in the apogee dr12 data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that ngc  6522 is likely to host multiple populations , but a strong statement to that effect must await the availability of good quality data for a larger sample .",
    "as part of the sdss - iii / apogee survey , we have obtained elemental abundances for 23 candidate members of five massive globular clusters located in the inner galaxy , including some of the most metal - rich known galactic gcs .",
    "our main conclusions are summarised as follows :    * spreads in [ n / fe ] have been detected in all gcs for which more than one star was observed , and all these abundances could be measured . among the latter gcs , all but palomar 6 also exhibit significant spreads in [ c / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , and [ na / fe ] .",
    "the standard anti - correlation between n and c , and correlations between n and al and na are also present in our data .",
    "this result indicates the prevalence of the multiple - population phenomenon in gcs as metal - rich as [ fe / h]@xmath50.1 . in at least one gc",
    "for which our sample is largest ( ngc  6553 ) , there is strong evidence for a bimodal distribution in the abundances of c and n. we conclude that n - rich stars are present in metal - rich gcs , and therefore they can be used as reliable tracers of field gc - like populations over a wide range of metallicities . as a corollary ,",
    "the absence of a large population of metal - rich n - rich stars in the sample discovered by @xcite in the inner galaxy reflects the metallicity distribution function of the presumptive destroyed gcs ; * the presence of large spreads in [ n / fe ] in metal - rich gcs is interesting also from the point of view of stellar - evolution models , as predictions from different groups seem to imply a strong dependence on metallicity of the yields of certain elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a large spread of al abundances in gcs of near - solar metallicity may constitute an important challenge to existing models .",
    "it would be naive to rule out a metallicity dependence of stellar yields on the basis of our results alone , but hopefully our numbers can be used for careful comparison with detailed model predictions based on state - of - the - art yields ; * for most of the gcs in our study the presence of multiple populations has been uncovered for the first time .",
    "this is the case for ngc  6553 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc  6528 , and palomar  6 . in the case of ngc  6522",
    ", the sample contains only one star , which happens to have a sg abundance pattern .",
    "since no gc is known to host only sg stars , it is very likely that ngc  6522 also contains multiple populations . for terzan  5 ,",
    "although multiple populations were known to be present with different [ fe / h ] , it is the first time that star - to - star variations in light elements is reported ; * the case of terzan  5 is particularly interesting , as it is a very massive gc with a substantial spread in [ fe / h]a feature that places it in the same category as objects like @xmath21  cen , m54 , and others , which are often referred to as remnants of dwarf satellites accreted to the galaxy ( for a short review , see * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting , in this regard , that terzan  5 displays abundance spreads and correlations similar to those found in @xmath21  cen @xcite , which suggests that these systems may occupy a region of parameter space somewhere in - between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the pursuit of a solution to the enigma of globular cluster formation and its connections with the formation of the galaxy itself will receive a great boost once a massive database of chemistry and kinematics of members of _ all _ galactic gcs is in place . despite valiant efforts",
    ", we are still scratching the surface .",
    "further progress is expected from observations taken from the southern hemisphere with apogee-2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the advent of high - resolution nir spectrographs with large multiplexing power and small fiber - collision radii , such as moons @xcite , will potentially bring about a paradigm shift in this field .",

    "<S> we report chemical abundances obtained by sdss - iii / apogee for giant stars in five globular clusters located within 2.2  kpc of the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> we detect the presence of multiple stellar populations in four of those clusters ( ngc  6553 , ngc  6528 , terzan  5 , and palomar  6 ) and find strong evidence for their presence in ngc  6522 . </S>",
    "<S> all clusters present a significant spread in the abundances of n , c , na , and al , with the usual correlations and anti - correlations between various abundances seen in other globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide important quantitative constraints on theoretical models for self - enrichment of globular clusters , by testing their predictions for the dependence of yields of elements such as na , n , c , and al on metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> they also confirm that , under the assumption that field n - rich stars originate from globular cluster destruction , they can be used as tracers of their parental systems in the high - metallicity regime .    </S>",
