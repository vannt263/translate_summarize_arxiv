    "the vortices govern the electromagnetic response of type - ii superconductors and have been extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite a vortex is formed from a core of radius @xmath2 where the superfluid density is gradually suppressed , @xmath3 the superconducting coherence length , and it is surrounded by a supercurrent which screens the magnetic field on a length of order @xmath4 , the penetration depth .",
    "the vortices are strong inhomogeneities of the superconducting condensate and they scatter the quasiparticles in several different ways.@xcite in particular , the vortices can capture bogoliubov excitations into low - energy localized states .",
    "the vortex - core states play an important role in the thermodynamic and transport properties in the mixed state .",
    "for example , when vortices move in an applied electric field , the core states interact with the lattice and are thus responsible for the dissipation of energy .",
    "these states are also affected by localized perturbations and they contribute to the pinning of vortices by defects or impurities .",
    "recently , mesoscopic superconducting disks have attracted much attention.@xcite in these systems a `` giant - vortex state '' can be stabilized , where a single vortex at the center of the sample carries the whole magnetic flux . in such a case the core states are the main low - energy excitations , and",
    "they are expected to play a dominant role .",
    "furthermore , the strong dependence of the vortex - core energy spectrum on the applied magnetic field opens interesting perspectives for applications.@xcite    in @xmath0-wave superconductors the vortex - core bound states were predicted long ago , based on approximate solutions of the microscopic bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations,@xcite and subsequently observed in nbse@xmath5 using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite the early analytical results were confirmed by a complete numerical solution of the bdg equations.@xcite extended quasiparticle excitations in the mixed state were often studied within the quasiclassical approach.@xcite although this approximation is considered inaccurate near the vortex core , it was used by volovik to argue that the number of branches of core states crossing the fermi energy as a function of angular momentum ( considered as a continuous variable ) is equal to the winding number of the vortex.@xcite this prediction was confirmed recently by a detailed numerical solution of the bdg equations for multiply - quantized vortices.@xcite the vortex - core states are usually thought of as andreev bound states , i.e. standing waves resulting from the multiple andreev reflection at the normal / superconductor boundary in the core.@xcite this interpretation suggests that the suppression of the superfluid density in the core is the main reason for the formation of the core states .",
    "the vanishing of the superfluid density in the core , however , plays no role in volovik s argument . instead , the structure of the vortex - core energy spectrum in the approach of ref .",
    "is entirely determined by the winding number of the vortex , which measures the strength of the supercurrent circulating around it .",
    "this result seems difficult to reconcile with the andreev - bound state picture . in particular",
    ", the peculiar dependence of the spectrum of core states on vorticity@xcite can hardly be attributed to the order - parameter suppression alone .",
    "hence it is of interest to identify the roles played by the supercurrent , on the one hand , and by the order - parameter suppression , on the other hand , in the formation of the vortex - core states .",
    "based on numerical and analytical solutions of the microscopic bdg equations , i show that the structure of the bound - state spectrum in @xmath0-wave and @xmath6-wave vortices is determined by a topological constraint that the circulating superfluid imposes to bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
    "the suppression of the order parameter in the core plays a minor quantitative role , slightly changing the energy of the states with small angular momenta .",
    "this implies , in particular , that a complete self - consistent treatment of the order - parameter profile is in general not necessary , unless one is interested in detailed quantitative predictions .",
    "these results suggest that the mechanism leading to quasiparticle localization in vortices is quite different from other localization mechanisms in condensed matter .",
    "a vortex is a topologically stable defect of the superconducting order parameter @xmath7.@xcite it is characterized by a winding number @xmath8 , a topological invariant defined as @xmath9 the integral runs along a closed path around the vortex axis .",
    "@xmath10 counts the number of @xmath11 rotations of the phase @xmath12 along the path .",

    ", @xmath8 corresponds to the magnetic flux @xmath13 carried by the vortex according to @xmath14 with @xmath15 the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "another characteristics of the vortex is the shape of the order - parameter modulus @xmath16 in the vicinity of the vortex axis , where it is constrained to vanish .    for an isolated axisymmetric vortex in a @xmath0-wave superconductor one has @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath8 is the winding number consistently with eq .",

    "although the gauge transformation removes the phase of the order parameter , it does not eliminate the supercurrent from the problem . in the radial equation ,",
    "the supercurrent shows up as a central potential containing a repulsive term @xmath51 , as well as a term @xmath52 which is either attractive or repulsive : if @xmath53 ( supercurrent flowing counter - clockwise , corresponding to a positive magnetic field along the @xmath37 axis ) this term is attractive ( repulsive ) for the electrons ( holes ) which move alike the superfluid ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "therefore , the supercurrent acts on the electron and hole parts of the bdg excitations in different ways , and tends to decrease the angular momentum of the former and to increase the angular momentum of the latter ( for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "this effect of the supercurrent on the bdg excitations is central to understand the formation of the core states ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : interpretation ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the supercurrent fixes the parity of the vortex - states angular momentum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) , which is half an odd integer for odd @xmath8 and integer for even @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath8 is odd , the flux carried by the vortex is not a multiple of the flux carried by the quasiparticle , hence a topological frustration which translates into a branch cut discontinuity  removed by the gauge transformation in eq .",

    "looking at the wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uv ] ) , one sees that in the radial equation this symmetry becomes @xmath56 : the vortex - core energy spectrum is invariant under the simultaneous inversion of angular momentum and energy .",

    "( [ eq : radial ] ) that the spectrum is also invariant under the simultaneous inversion of @xmath34 and @xmath8 .",
    "self - consistent solutions of the bdg equations for the order - parameter profile and the energy spectrum of an isolated @xmath0-wave vortex were already reported , both in the singly - quantized@xcite and multiply - quantized@xcite cases .",
    "the purpose of this section is to repeat these calculations without achieving the self - consistency in @xmath19 , in order to clarify the role played by the detailed form of @xmath19 and by the winding number @xmath8 in the formation of the core states .",
    "analytical solutions for the singly - quantized vortex also exist.@xcite i will discuss a new analytical solution which is valid for all ( integer ) values of @xmath8 , and which emphasizes the key role of the winding number .      the bdg equations ( [ eq : radial ] ) were solved numerically using the bessel - function expansion described in ref .  .",
    "besides its winding number and order - parameter profile , an isolated vortex in a continuum free - electron model is characterized by the bulk parameters @xmath40 and @xmath58 .",
    "physical values of @xmath59 range from @xmath60 in high-@xmath61 materials to @xmath62@xmath63 in conventional superconductors .",
    "simulations were performed for @xmath59 between @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( the computational effort increases rapidly with increasing @xmath59 ) .",

    "the reported conclusions apply to the whole domain of parameters investigated . below i present results for @xmath70 and @xmath71.@xcite for the order - parameter profile the following form was used:@xcite @xmath72",
    "this functional form with @xmath73 is in good qualitative agreement with the self - consistent results of ref .  .",

    "subgap energy spectrum of a singly - quantized @xmath0-wave vortex as a function of angular momentum @xmath34 for various order - parameter profiles in the core : nearly self - consistent profile ( black circles ) , `` no - core '' profile ( white circles ) , and step - like profile ( squares ) .",
    "the triangles show the energy spectrum of a normal region analogous to a vortex core embedded in a uniform superconductor ( no supercurrent).,width=283 ]    the spectra of subgap states for a singly - quantized vortex ( @xmath76 ) and for gap profiles corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath77 are shown in fig .",
    "the eigenvalues are displayed as a function of the angular quantum number @xmath34 . at energies outside the superconducting gap ,",
    "the bdg states form a continuum not shown in the figure .",
    "the spectrum obtained for a step - like profile @xmath78 , which is often used in analytical calculations , is also displayed for comparison .",
    "the spectra are similar in all three cases , except for small differences at low values of @xmath79 .",
    "these differences have a rather simple explanation : the corresponding eigenstates are concentrated close to the vortex axis  the maximum of the wave function lies roughly at position @xmath80 in units of @xmath3 ; thus the pairing energy of the states with @xmath81 is lowered when the order parameter gets suppressed at @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear from the figure , however , that the spectrum retains its general shape even when the vortex has no normal core . in particular ,",
    "the number of branches crossing the fermi energy is always one , in agreement with volovik s theorem .",
    "we have seen that suppressing the normal core , keeping only the supercurrent , does not change the core states qualitatively .",
    "we may now do the converse : in order to suppress the supercurrent and keep only the core , we set the phase of the order parameter to zero [ i.e. @xmath83 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : uv])([eq : radial ] ) ] and we use the profile eq .",

    "the resulting order parameter no longer describes a vortex , since the winding number vanishes , but just a normal region embedded in a uniform superconductor . the resulting spectrum ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is qualitatively different from the spectrum of a singly - quantized vortex . consistently with volovik s result , no branch of core states cross the fermi level , and therefore no low - energy states exist , although multiple andreev reflections are in principle possible in this system .",
    "the suppression of the order parameter slightly decreases the pairing energy of the low-@xmath79 electron and hole excitations of the uniform superconductor , and gives rise to two shallow branches of states near the gap edges .",

    "[ fig2 ] compares the local density of states ( ldos ) of a singly - quantized vortex with and without normal core .",
    "as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the effect of the normal core is mainly to raise the peak at the vortex center , without changing the structure of the ldos .",
    "the energy of the peak is also closer to the fermi energy when the normal core is present .",
    "this is due to the core - induced energy change at low @xmath34 . indeed , since only states with @xmath86 contribute to the ldos at @xmath87 [ see eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] also shows the ldos of a normal core without supercurrent .",
    "in this case there is no zero - bias peak , but two sharp peaks near @xmath90 corresponding to the two branches in fig .",
    "these peaks disappear beyond a distance of order @xmath3 and the ldos becomes that of the uniform superconductor for @xmath91 .",

    "in addition , other branches cross zero energy at higher angular momenta .",
    "the profile of @xmath19 affects the core states with @xmath92 . except for small quantitative differences ,",
    "the ldos computed with and without the normal core are therefore very similar , as for the singly - quantized vortex .    from figs .",

    "as already mentioned , the velocity field due to the supercurrent changes the angular momenta of the electron and hole parts of the bdg excitations in opposite ways . as a result ,",
    "a phase difference of @xmath96 is induced between the _ radial _ wave functions of the electron and hole .",

    "the latter again decomposes into two symmetric excitations at larger distances .",
    "the resulting ldos is thus very similar to that of a doubly - quantized @xmath0-wave vortex ( see fig .  4 of ref .  ) , and can be readily interpreted on the basis of fig .",
    "a similar analysis shows that all of the features of the @xmath0-wave vortex with @xmath171 ( fig .  4 of ref .  )",
    "can be distinguished in the ldos of the @xmath171 @xmath6-wave vortex ( fig .",

    "the ldos exhibits some anisotropy around the vortex , but the differences between the nodal and antinodal directions are small . in particular , all the features discussed in fig .",

    "the results of the previous sections suggest that the core states have a topological origin .",
    "an implication of this is that the states must not be suppressed by changes in the phase of the order parameter , as long as these changes preserve the topological defect .",
    "conversely , the core states should be strongly affected by the interaction with an antivortex , since the latter annihilates the effect of the topological defect on orbits larger than the vortex - antivortex distance . in this section ,",
    "i investigate the effects of some perturbations of the phase field on the core states in a @xmath6-wave superconductor , starting with the perturbation induced by a nearby antivortex .",
    "the order - parameter for a vortex - antivortex pair was taken as the normalized product of the order parameters associated with each constituent ( i.e. two vortices with winding numbers @xmath64 and @xmath172 and @xmath162 ) .",
    "the vortex is located at the origin and the antivortex at position @xmath173 . in fig .",

    "note also that the zbcp is already split at site @xmath177 , unlike in the isolated case where this splitting occurs first at site @xmath178 .",
    "reducing the vortex - antivortex distance ( @xmath179 ) , the zbcp at site @xmath168 also splits . at the same time",

    "[ fig7 ] show that the formation of the core states is a nonlocal process : the ldos at a particular site depends on the phase winding in a region much larger than the core radius @xmath74 .",
    "in fact the height of the zbcp at @xmath168 reaches @xmath182 of its value in the isolated vortex for vortex - antivortex separations as large as @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "this value sets an upper bound for the size of the aforementioned region . on the other hand ,",
    "a clear splitting of the zbcp at site @xmath168 occurs for @xmath185 or less , which sets a lower bound to @xmath186 .",
    "these numbers can be compared with the spatial extension of the core states . in the @xmath0-wave vortex",
    "the latter is typically @xmath187 for a state at @xmath165 [ see eq .",

    "thus , although the typical localization radius of the bound states might be different in @xmath6-wave and @xmath0-wave superconductors,@xcite one may conclude that the ldos in the vortex core `` feels '' the presence of an antivortex ( or another vortex in a vortex lattice ) at any distance shorter than the extension of the bound states .",
    "the sensitivity of the ldos to perturbations of the phase which preserve the topological defect was studied by randomly disordering the phase field , i.e. replacing the order parameter @xmath191 of the isolated vortex by @xmath192 where @xmath193 is a random gaussian variable centered at @xmath194 with variance @xmath195 ( fwhm ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig5 ] imply that the suppression of the modulus @xmath16 of the order parameter in the core can be safely ignored when discussing the mechanism of formation of the vortex states in @xmath0- and @xmath6-wave superconductors .",
    "the main reason is the small magnitude of the superconducting gap with respect to the fermi energy : a local suppression of @xmath16 is a _ very weak _ perturbation for excitations at the fermi surface , which does not provide a substantial gain of pairing energy for a localized bogoliubov excitation ( unless the localization radius is smaller than the core radius , which in turn costs a large kinetic energy ) . making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenvalues ] ) with @xmath83 , one can see that a local suppression of @xmath16 can induce low - energy states in the limit @xmath201 , which is never attained in the bcs superconductors for which @xmath202 .",
    "thus the origin of the bound states must be searched in the phase @xmath12 of the order parameter .",
    "far from the vortex , the slow variation of @xmath12 is known to induce a small density of states in the gap by the doppler - shift effect.@xcite the doppler - shift approximation is not valid in the core region because there the superfluid velocity is too large , but also because this approximation neglects the topological defect associated with the phase winding . a comparison of the right panels in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] unambiguously shows that the microscopic details of @xmath12 are much less relevant to the formation of the vortex ldos than the `` macroscopic '' phase winding .",
    "this is further evidenced by the qualitative differences between even-@xmath8 and odd-@xmath8 vortices . the mechanism described in sect .",
    "[ sect : interpretation ] provides a natural explanation to these results , since the interference between the electron and the hole , which is responsible for the formation of the bound states , is a global property of the wave function and is not destroyed by local perturbations of @xmath12 .",
    "the issue of self - consistency in the order parameter ( modulus and phase ) is one of the major obstacles to a complete analytical calculation of the vortex - core ldos . nevertheless , the results of the present study suggest that the ldos calculated from the simplest possible `` trial '' order parameter , i.e. a uniform modulus @xmath203 and a geometric phase @xmath204 , should exhibit all the characteristic features of the exact solution .",

    "( [ eq : nu ] ) depends on the number of defects contained in the path of integration .",
    "based on the analysis in section  [ sect : phase ] , i tentatively argue that the structure of the vortex core ldos is determined primarily by the average vorticity in the region occupied by the core states .",
    "this statement was checked by considering a variety of vortex and antivortex configurations .",
    "for example the effect of a @xmath205 antivortex on the ldos in the core of a @xmath76 vortex was studied .",
    "the antivortex was located at position @xmath173 as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for small ( @xmath206 ) and large ( @xmath207 ) vortex - antivortex separations the ldos was found to be close to that of an isolated vortex .",
    "near @xmath208 the spectrum was similar to the topmost case in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , corresponding to @xmath83 .",
    "finally in the other regions the ldos exhibited intermediate shapes . in this geometry the vorticity is @xmath172 in the region @xmath209 and @xmath210 in the region @xmath211 , so that the average vorticity in a region of radius @xmath100 is @xmath212 if @xmath213 and @xmath172 if @xmath214 . thus @xmath215 for small and large @xmath216 , whereas @xmath217 for @xmath218 .    in the normal state of the superconducting cuprates , the behavior of the high - frequency optical conductivity@xcite and the presence of a large nernst signal@xcite have been generally attributed to vortex excitations , in the form of unbound vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "recently , lee@xcite argued that such vortices have to be `` cheap '' , i.e. must be free of core states in order to have a formation energy comparable to the thermal energy @xmath219 .",
    "experimentally , there is indeed convincing evidence from stm@xcite and nmr@xcite measurements that the core states are suppressed at @xmath220 in the cuprates , pointing to a failure of the simple @xmath6-wave bcs theory in the superconducting state .",
    "lee pointed out that a straightforward extension of the bcs theory which includes phase fluctuations is unable to produce `` cheap '' vortices in the normal state .",
    "this argument relies on the assumption that the average vortex core ldos in a vortex - antivortex soup is similar to the ldos of an isolated vortex . as fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows , however , the vortex core states can be very efficiently suppressed in a `` bcs '' vortex anti - vortex pair , even when the vortex - antivortex separation is much larger than the core radius .",
    "it is likely that the same phenomenon also occurs in more sophisticated models of the high-@xmath61 superconductors .",
    "a systematic investigation of the core energy as a function of the vortex density in a state of fluctuating vortex - antivortex pairs would thus be helpful to elucidate the nature of the normal state in the cuprates .    in this study ,",
    "the effect of the order - parameter symmetry on the properties of the vortex states was left aside , and the emphasis was put on the similarities of the ldos in @xmath0- and @xmath6-wave vortices , which illustrates the key role of the vorticity in both cases .",
    "it is well known that a subdominant order parameter can induce qualitative changes in the ldos of bcs vortices.@xcite furthermore , the delicate question of the spatial extension of the core states in the @xmath6-wave case ( exponentially localized or extended ) was not addressed .",
    "these issues are a good motivation to search for a realistic analytical solution of the bdg equations for vortices in superconductors with nonlocal pairing .",
    "in the bcs theory , the superconducting state is characterized by a complex order parameter , with a modulus @xmath16 related to the superfluid density , and a phase @xmath12 related to the supercurrent .",
    "although the electronic states bound to vortices have been generally attributed to the suppression of the superfluid density in the core region , it was found that the bound states are completely formed when this suppression is overlooked . in order to explain the formation of the core states , a new mechanism was proposed , which relies upon the influence that the vortex supercurrent exerts on the bogoliubov excitations . in short , the bogoliubov excitations localize onto vortices because the _ topology _ of the latter  not the normal core  gives to the electron and hole components the possibility to avoid one another and to minimize their pairing energy .",
    "the spectral properties of vortices carrying more than one flux quantum , as well as of vortex - antivortex pairs , are consistent with this idea .",
