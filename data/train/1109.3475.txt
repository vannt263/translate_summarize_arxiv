    "then for @xmath34 the symbol @xmath35 @xmath36stands for both of them ; that is , by @xmath35 we mean @xmath15 or @xmath37  we set @xmath38 and @xmath39 where the @xmath40-th coordinate equals @xmath41    let @xmath42 be a subset of @xmath35 .  by a copy of @xmath42",

    "each copy of the double - sphere @xmath49 can be obtained by a translation of the double - sphere @xmath50 for some @xmath51 a collection @xmath52 of copies of @xmath42 constitutes a tiling of @xmath35 by @xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 for all @xmath56 a tiling @xmath57 of @xmath58 by @xmath42 that consists of translations of @xmath42 can be described as @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",

    "it is not difficult to see that for @xmath14 and for lattice case in @xmath15 our definition of diameter perfect lee codes is equivalent to the definition due to etzion .",
    "any error - correcting perfect lee code is also a diameter perfect lee code .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that , for @xmath73 even , the anticode of diameter @xmath108 of the maximum size is the lee sphere @xmath48 with @xmath109 thus , for @xmath73 odd , @xmath110 and @xmath111 codes are @xmath70 and @xmath112 codes where @xmath113 , respectively .",

    "suppose that we need to show the existence of a diameter-@xmath73 perfect lee code in @xmath116where @xmath73 is even . then all we need to do is to prove that there is a tiling @xmath117 of @xmath35 by the double - sphere @xmath114 of radius @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , choose a fixed tile @xmath119 in @xmath105 let @xmath120 be one of the two words forming the center of @xmath121we will prove that the set @xmath122 belongs to the center of @xmath123 and @xmath124 is even , @xmath125 is a distance-@xmath73 perfect lee code .",
    "clearly , @xmath126 is well defined as the center of @xmath123 consists of two words at distance @xmath127 that is , one of them at even and the other at odd distance from @xmath128 @xmath126 is a transversal of @xmath129 thus we need only to prove that @xmath130 for any @xmath131 .",
    "clearly , the distance of any two words in @xmath126 is even .",
    "this is obvious to see for @xmath132  it is not true in general for @xmath133 it is valid only in the case when @xmath0 is even .",
    "however , as the size of @xmath114 is even ( see e ) @xmath134 has to be even as well , which in turn implies @xmath0 is even .",
    "so for the distance of any two words in @xmath126 we have @xmath135 and since @xmath124 is even , we get @xmath136 we have proved :    [ x]if there is a tiling of @xmath35 by double - spheres @xmath114 then there is a distance-@xmath73 perfect lee code in @xmath35 with @xmath137moreover , if @xmath138 is a tiling of @xmath139 by translations of @xmath114 such that the weight @xmath140 of @xmath141 is even for all @xmath142 then @xmath68 is a diameter-@xmath73 perfect lee code .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the existence and to enumerate diameter perfect lee codes .",
    "it turns out that some results on diameter perfect lee codes and on perfect error - correcting lee codes are similar but in some cases the results on the two types of codes are very much different .",

    "golomb - welch conjecture claims that there are no @xmath70 codes for @xmath146 and @xmath147 the current state of this conjecture as well as its extension to @xmath110 codes and a further extension to perfect dominating sets is provided in section 2 .",
    "we defined perfect lee codes by means of tilings . in @xcite s. stein introduced an algebraic construction of lattice tilings based on group homomorphisms .",
    "he used this construction for tilings by crosses .",
    "this construction , and its variations occur in many papers , see e.g. @xcite . in section 3 a generalization of stein s",

    "the main results of this paper are stated in section 4 .",
    "it is believed , see section 2 , that , with only one exception of @xmath149 code , there are no @xmath110 codes , and also no @xmath111 codes for @xmath150 and @xmath151 all values of @xmath0 for which there exists a linear @xmath152 code ( = a linear @xmath153 code ) were determined in @xcite .",
    "we prove an analogous result for linear @xmath154 codes . as to the enumeration of all @xmath155 codes ,",
    "etzion @xcite proved that there are uncountable many of them if @xmath2 is a power of @xmath156 we show that this is also the case for the other values of @xmath157 the situation with @xmath158 codes is very much different .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that there are uncountable many @xmath159 codes if @xmath8 is not a prime . however , on the other hand it was showed there that there is only one , up to isomorphism , @xmath160 code , and the authors conjectured that the same is true for each @xmath2 where @xmath8 is a prime .",
    "we note that the existence of uncountable many @xmath155 codes implies that there are uncountable many non - periodic @xmath155 codes as the total number of periodic @xmath155 codes is at most @xmath161 non - periodic @xmath155 codes were constructed by means of non - regular lattice tilings ( i.e. tilings that are not a face - to - face tilings ) of @xmath162 by a cluster of cubes centered at words of a double - sphere @xmath163 this is another example of a well know situation when to solve a problem we need to generalize it first .",
    "we note that results in section 4 answer in the affirmative questions ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 8) raised by etzion in @xcite .",
    "question ( 6 ) from @xcite was answered in @xcite .  finally , in section 5 an efficient decoding algorithm for linear perfect lee codes , both diameter and error - correcting , is designed .",
    "thanks to the representation of these codes by tilings constructed via a group homomorphism , the computation complexity of this algorithm is @xmath164 for @xmath165 codes , and its complexity is @xmath166 for @xmath167 codes .",
    "we recall that @xmath168 codes are believed not to exists for @xmath169 and @xmath151",

    "the points @xmath692 belong to distinct connectivity components @xmath693 of @xmath694 we recall that @xmath695    the connectivity components of @xmath658 can be shifted along @xmath665-axis independently of each other and on @xmath668 this property of @xmath658 will be used to construct @xmath696 non - isomorphic @xmath155 codes .",
    "let @xmath697 be an irrational number , @xmath698 be its binary representation .",
    "a tiling @xmath699 will be obtained from the tiling @xmath57 by translating connectivity components @xmath693 of @xmath658 as follows : if @xmath700 or @xmath701 then the component @xmath693 will be shifted by @xmath702 otherwise it will be shifted by @xmath703 clearly all double - crosses in @xmath699 are centered at integer points . in other words , @xmath704 is a tiling such that all coordinates of any @xmath705 are integers .",
    "such tiling will be called a @xmath9-tiling .",
    "obviously , for any two irrational numbers @xmath25 and @xmath706 the corresponding tilings @xmath707 and @xmath708 are distinct ; we recall that two tilings @xmath709 and @xmath710 are called distinct if @xmath68 and @xmath711 are distinct .",
    "so we have produced a family @xmath712 @xmath25 is an irrational number in @xmath713 of @xmath714 distinct @xmath9-tilings of @xmath584 by double - crosses .",
    "each @xmath9-tiling of @xmath584 by double - crosses induces a tiling of @xmath15 by double - spheres .",
    "so the family @xmath98 induces a family @xmath715 of @xmath716 distinct tilings of @xmath15 by double - spheres @xmath717 .",
    "clearly @xmath718 for each tiling @xmath719 that is @xmath720 for each tiling @xmath57 in @xmath98 .",
    "to each tiling @xmath721 in @xmath715 we assign a set @xmath722 is a center of @xmath723 and @xmath724 is even@xmath725 is even@xmath726 is odd@xmath727 where @xmath728 is the lee weight of @xmath729 .",
    "it was showed in the proof of theorem [ x ] , that @xmath730 is a @xmath155 code .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath731 and @xmath732 are distinct tilings in @xmath715 then the induced codes @xmath733 and @xmath734 are distinct as well .",
    "thus , we have constructed a family @xmath735 of @xmath622 distinct @xmath155 codes . as each code in @xmath736 is isomorphic to at most @xmath625 codes in @xmath737(we recall that two codes @xmath57 and @xmath732are isomorphic if there exists a linear distance preserving bijection mapping @xmath57 onto @xmath732 ) @xmath736 has to contain a set of @xmath622 non - isomorphic @xmath155 codes .",
    "the proof is complete .    as an easy consequence",
    "we get :    for each @xmath621 the number of non - periodic @xmath155 codes is @xmath624    it is easy to see that for each @xmath738 there are at most finitely many @xmath300-periodic @xmath155 codes .",
    "therefore , in aggregate , there are at most @xmath739 periodic @xmath155 codes .",
    "as there are in total @xmath740 @xmath155 codes , @xmath622 of them have to be non - periodic .",
    "we note that szabo @xcite constructed non - regular lattice tilings of @xmath584 by @xmath2-crosses if @xmath8 is a prime .",
    "the non - existence of such lattice tiling for @xmath8 being a prime follows from a result of redei @xcite on factorization of abelian groups .",
    "we have constructed a lattice non - regular tiling of @xmath162 by @xmath2-double - cross for all @xmath2 that are not a power of @xmath225 .",
    "we believe that there are no non - regular tilings of @xmath162 by @xmath2-double - cross but at the moment we are not able to prove it .",
    "in this section we design an algorithm for decoding a linear @xmath168 code .",
    "the computational complexity of this algorithm is linear in @xmath741 for @xmath410 and its complexity is @xmath166 for @xmath167 codes .",
    "we recall that @xmath110 codes are believed not to exists for @xmath169 and @xmath742 we stress that this algorithm can be applied to all perfect lee codes as diameter perfect lee codes include also perfect error - correcting codes .",
    "the efficiency of the algorithm is achieved thanks to the representation of linear codes by means of a tiling constructed through a group homomorphism .",
    "we design the algorithm for a linear @xmath110 code . in case of a linear @xmath107 code",
    "it suffices to realize that , by theorem [ a ] , the code is a restriction of a @xmath110 code and the corresponding algorithm would be nearly identical .",
    "let @xmath68 be a linear @xmath110 code . theorem [ b ] implies that there is a homomorphism @xmath743 where @xmath232 is an abelian group of order @xmath744 @xmath329 is the anticode of diameter @xmath85 of maximum size , and that the restriction of @xmath745to @xmath329 is a bijection .",
    "denote by @xmath746 the function inverse to the restriction of @xmath254 to @xmath747    assume that we receive a word @xmath748 first we find the element @xmath749 of the group @xmath610 @xmath36if @xmath750 the neutral element in @xmath751 we are done as @xmath405 is a codeword in @xmath68 . in general the corresponding codeword @xmath142 is given by @xmath752 indeed , @xmath753 is a tiling of @xmath15 by @xmath747 thus , each element @xmath754 can be written in a unique way as @xmath755 where @xmath142 is the sought codeword and @xmath756 hence , @xmath757    hence the complexity of the algorithm is in fact the number of operations needed for calculation of @xmath758 we note that the number of operations in the calculation of @xmath759 is linear in @xmath2 since @xmath760 , where the values @xmath761 will be stored .",
    "now we bound from above the number of operations needed for the calculation of the values of the function @xmath762 for any element @xmath310 in the group @xmath610 the values of the function @xmath762 need to be calculated only once and therefore time needed for obtaining these values is not included in the complexity of the decoding algorithm .",
    "the values of @xmath762 will be stored in a tabular way and we will evaluate time needed to find the value of @xmath763 in the table for given @xmath235 .",
    "the size of the table is the order of the group @xmath83 which equals @xmath764 it is known , see @xcite , that the volume of the double - sphere is @xmath765the volume of the sphere @xmath48 is smaller than the volume of @xmath114 therefore we find the bound only for the double - sphere @xmath114 .",
    "however , we can find the required value of @xmath762 in the table in an efficient way . as @xmath766 is an abelian group ,",
    "@xmath81 can be written as a direct product of cyclic groups @xmath767 .",
    "we store values of @xmath762 in the lexicographic order ; that is , first comes value of @xmath762 at @xmath768 then value of @xmath762  at @xmath769 then at @xmath770 etc .",
    "the rank @xmath25 of an element @xmath771 in this order is @xmath772    hence , the rank @xmath773 can be calculated in time linear with @xmath598 as from ( 2 ) it follows @xmath774 the maximum value of @xmath598 is achieved when @xmath775 thus the maximum value of @xmath776 .",
    "for @xmath171 we get @xmath777 thus @xmath778 where @xmath779 for @xmath196 it is @xmath780 thus @xmath781 in aggregate , the complexity of the algorithm for @xmath165 codes is @xmath782 and its complexity is @xmath166 for @xmath167 codes ."
